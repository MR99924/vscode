Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic output could stagnate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019. On the one hand, 
domestic economic activity proved remarkably 
robust towards the end of the period under re -
view. This is because the situation in the labour 
market is favourable despite the economic 
slowdown. Most recently, employment even 
recorded a somewhat stronger rise again and 
unemployment declined. Consumption- related 
services, in particular, should benefit from this 
development. Retail sales fell significantly in 
October after a significant increase during the 
summer months. However, enterprises in this 
sector still regarded their business situation as 
very good according to the ifo Institute, and 
consumer sentiment also remained upbeat. On 
the other hand, the decline in industrial output, 
which is heavily dependent on exports, is likely 
to continue. This is due, in part, to the fact that 
enterprises in Germany are now probably more 
reluctant to invest. Economic activity in Ger -
many is thus expected to remain broadly split in 
the final quarter. In the meantime, however, 
the first tentative signs are emerging that in -
dustry could stabilise in the future. Business ex -
pectations in the manufacturing sector im -
proved somewhat, for example, although they 
remain in negative territory. Furthermore, in -
dustrial firms’ order situation did not deterior -
ate any further in the past few months, and 
exports were up significantly.1
Industry
German industrial output continued to contract 
unabated in October 2019 and was down sub -
stantially on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms (-1¾%). In a comparison with the aver -
age of the third quarter, the decrease was even 
more significant (-2¼%). Output of intermedi -ate goods increased perceptibly (+½%), and 
the production of consumer goods fell only 
slightly (-½%), but the production of capital 
goods was down sharply (-5%). Together with 
the mechanical engineering sector, car manu -
facturing, in particular, had a quite significant 
adverse effect (-5½%), with bridge days pos -
sibly exerting a somewhat dampening impact. 
This is suggested by the fact that, according to 
data provided by the Association of the Auto -
motive Industry (VDA), the number of passen -
ger cars manufactured in November was dis -
tinctly higher on the month after seasonal ad -
justment, returning to the level reached in Sep -
tember. This indicates that there will be a 
certain countermovement for motor vehicle 
output in November.
In October 2019, industrial new orders were 
not quite able to maintain the steep growth of 
the previous month, dropping slightly (-½%) in 
seasonally adjusted terms compared to the 
September level. Compared with the previous 
quarter, there was still a marked increase 
(+½%). However, this was mainly attributable 
to the typically irregular influx of large orders in 
other transport equipment, which will probably 
lead to higher output with a certain time lag. 
Excluding these, incoming orders would have 
fallen noticeably (-¾%). Broken down by re -
gion, German industrial firms suffered, in par -
ticular, from overall weak domestic demand 
(-3%). Moreover, the inflow of new orders 
from non- euro area countries was clearly down 
on the previous quarter (-1¾%). By contrast, 
orders from the euro area rose sharply 
(+10¼%), with large orders for other transport 
equipment playing a decisive role. With regard 
to the individual sectors, meanwhile, the order 
situation in the industrial sector improved on a 
broad basis. Manufacturers of consumer 
goods, for example, enjoyed a clear increase in German 
 economy could 
stagnate in the 
fourth quarter

demand (+1%). Producers of capital goods also 
reported a marked improvement in new orders 
(+½%). It would have been significantly more 
substantial if the exceptionally strong growth in 
other transport equipment due to large orders 
had not been offset by a steep decline in the 
mechanical engineering sector. The automotive 
sector saw only a slight contraction in orders. 
New orders in the intermediate goods industry 
were slightly up on the quarter (+¼%).
Nominal industrial turnover was more robust 
than industrial output in October 2019 and re -
mained unchanged on the month in seasonally 
adjusted terms. However, it was slightly lower 
than the average of the third quarter (-¼%). 
Broken down by sector, weak sales of capital 
goods, in particular, had a dampening effect. 
This was due to a strong decline in turnover in 
mechanical engineering and other transport 
equipment. Manufacturers of intermediate 
goods also reported a marked decline in sales. 
By contrast, the consumer goods industry pro -
vided momentum. Driven by foreign demand, 
the pharmaceutical sector reported quite sub -
stantial growth in sales here. In regional terms, 
lower domestic sales were the key factor in the 
overall decline. By contrast, export sales were 
up significantly. German industrial enterprises 
saw sales stagnate in the euro area, while con -
siderably more was sold in non- euro area coun -
tries. In line with this, there was a steep month- 
on- month increase in nominal exports in Octo -
ber 2019 after seasonal adjustment (+1¼%). 
They were also significantly higher than the 
level of the third quarter, in both nominal and 
real terms (+2% in each case). After seasonal 
adjustment, nominal goods imports were un -
changed in October on the month. Compared 
with the previous quarter, they were distinctly 
higher in terms of value and after price adjust -
ment (+¾% in each case).

month, which meant that it was also down 
considerably on the previous quarter’s level 
(-1½%). This was mainly attributable to a steep 
drop in activity in the finishing trades (-2¼%). 
By contrast, output in the main construction in -
dustry contracted only slightly (-½%). Notwith -
standing this dampener, the boom in the con -
struction sector is likely to continue. After sea -
sonal adjustment, there was a perceptible 
quarter- on- quarter increase (+½%) in new 
orders received by the main construction sector 
in the third quarter – the latest for which data 
are available – from an already high level. Ac -
cording to surveys carried out by the ifo Insti -
tute, capacity utilisation and the reach of orders 
in the main construction sector also remained 
close to peak levels. In addition, building per -
mits, which have been on an upward trend 
since the beginning of the year, indicate that 
construction activity is likely to remain buoyant.
Labour market
The labour market has not only proved to be 
quite resilient in the current economic slow -
down, but in fact improved markedly towards 
the end of the period under review. In October, 
employment increased by around twice as 
much as the average of the past six months. 
There were 30,000 more persons in work in 
seasonally adjusted terms than in the previous 
month, and the year- on- year increase was 
320,000 persons or +0.7%. According to the 
initial figure provided by the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, employment subject to social se -
curity contributions even rose sharply on the 
month in September. It also increased consider -
ably more strongly than total employment on 
the year. By contrast, other forms of employ -
ment, in particular exclusively low- paid part-  
time employment and self- employment, are 
still on the decline. Only limited use is being 
made of cyclical short- time working, with just a 
small rise recorded in September. The leading 
indicators for labour demand did not deterior -
ate further overall, and the ifo employment barometer even showed a significant improve -
ment in the services sector.
In November, the number of people registered 
as unemployed declined markedly for the first 
time since April. After seasonal adjustment, 
2.27 million people were officially registered as 
unemployed with the Federal Employment 
Agency, around 16,000 fewer than in October. 
The unemployment rate remained unchanged 
at 5.0%. Unemployment roughly corresponded 
to its level a year earlier. The decline in Novem -
ber is entirely due to favourable developments 
among those receiving the basic allowance. In 
the category of SGB III job seekers (those re -
ceiving unemployment benefits under the 
statutory unemployment insurance scheme), 
which largely follows cyclical developments, 
the number of unemployed persons was 
slightly higher on the month. The unemploy -
ment barometer of the Institute for Employ -
ment Research (IAB) improved significantly in 
November and is now close to the neutral 
threshold.
Prices
Oil prices rose markedly in November as a re -
sult of slightly better economic prospects and 
speculation about production cutbacks at OPEC 
and its partners. They were just over 5% higher 
than in October and only slightly down on the 
previous year’s level. Prices rose again slightly in 
December and, as this report went to press, 
the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil was 
US$66. Crude oil futures were trading at con -
siderable discounts. The discount on crude oil 
futures was US$3 for deliveries six months 
ahead and US$5 for deliveries 12 months 
ahead.
Both import and producer prices were down 
slightly overall in October. While there was a 
moderate rise in imported energy prices, en -
ergy prices remained virtually unchanged in in -
dustrial domestic sales. Excluding energy, how -
ever, prices were lower at both stages. Import Steep decline

prices were 3.5% down on the year overall, 
which was slightly more than in the previous 
month, and the corresponding rate was now 
clearly negative (-0.6%) in the case of industrial 
producer prices as well.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices as meas -
ured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) rose moderately in November 
2019, having remained unchanged in October. 
Energy prices were unchanged on the month 
despite crude oil becoming more expensive be -
cause refineries’ margins were squeezed at the 
same time. However, industrial goods exclud -
ing energy and food became distinctly more 
expensive, and prices for services were also 
somewhat higher. Overall, the annual HICP rate 
rose from 0.9% to 1.2%. In the case of the rate 
excluding energy and food, the increase from 
1.1% to 1.8% was even more pronounced. 
Here, a statistical effect in relation to prices for 
package holidays, which had had a dampening 
effect since July, now had a marked upward 
impact.2 At 1.1%, the CPI, which is not im -
pacted by this effect, was therefore also slightly 
lower than the HICP in November, but from 
July to October it was higher. As of the current 
month, the statistical effect in relation to pack -
age holidays ceases to apply and the HICP rates 
are once again undistorted.
Public finances3
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) recorded a deficit of €½ 
billion in the third quarter of 2019. This 
amounted to a deterioration of €1½ billion on 
the year, which was due to the finances of the 
health insurance institutions. Supplementary 
contribution rates, which were roughly 0.1 per -
centage point lower on average, accounted for 
just under €½ billion of this decline.The health insurance institutions’ revenue, 
which mainly consists of transfers from the 
health fund, grew by 3½%. The decline in sup -
plementary contribution rates dampened this 
growth by ½ percentage point. The rise in ex -
penditure came to 6% and was thus consider -
ably sharper than in the first half of the year. 
Spending on benefits increased by as much as 
6½%.
The health fund likewise posted a revenue in -
crease of 3½%. Employees’ contributions rose 
by the same amount. By contrast, growth in 
contribution receipts from pensions, at 4½%, 
was stronger because of the expansion of 
“mothers’ pensions” at the beginning of the 
year. Revenue growth was dampened by the 
fall in supplementary contribution rates, lower 
minimum contributions for the self- employed 
and the unchanged central government grant. 
The contributions of low- income earners have 
also been lower since July as a result of the rais -
ing of the sliding scale within which they pay 
reduced contribution rates. At just over 3½%, 
expenditure growth was only slightly stronger.
For the first three quarters combined, the SHI 
scheme’s balance is now around €2½ billion 
down on the year. A deficit is therefore likely to 
be posted for the year as a whole, compared 
with the significant surplus of €2½ billion re -
corded in 2018 (according to the annual ac -
counts). As in 2018, the health fund will prob -
ably close the year with a slight surplus (2018: 
€½ billion). The deterioration in the scheme’s 
finances is mainly attributable to the health in -
surance institutions, which are likely to record a 
deficit (2018: surplus of €2 billion according to 
the annual accounts).Consumer prices

The health fund looks likely to post a significant 
deficit in 2020. The health insurance institu -
tions’ deficit might rise somewhat further. The 
group of SHI estimators expects an increase of 
almost 4% in income subject to compulsory in -
surance contributions. The central government 
grant will remain unchanged. According to the 
Federal Ministry of Health, growth in the health 
insurance institutions’ expenditure is set to be 
somewhat weaker than in 2019 but still reach 
4½%. The number of insured persons is ex -
pected to rise by ½%. The projected increase in 
expenditure can be traced back, in part, to the 
benefit expansions of previous years.
The Federal Ministry of Health sets the arith -
metical supplementary contribution rate re -
quired to cover the expected relevant expend -
iture. For 2020, the ministry’s calculations indi -
cate an increase of 0.1 percentage point in this 
rate compared with the actual average for 
2019, bringing it up to 1.1%. The health insur -
ance institutions expect expenditure to rise 
somewhat, resulting in a further 0.1 percent -
age point higher supplementary contribution 
rate.4 Each health insurance institution decides 
for itself whether to adjust its own supplemen -
tary contribution rate. As some institutions cur -
rently have very large reserves (totalling around 
€20½ billion across all institutions according to 
recent figures), it appears possible that supple -
mentary contributions will remain largely un -
changed on average next year. This would lead 
to a perceptible rise in the institutions’ deficit.
The group of estimators forecast a deficit of 
just under €1 billion for the health fund in 
2020. The transfers to the innovation and 
structural funds and a special transfer to the 
health insurance institutions are to be drawn 
from the reserve. Since the estimators’ fore -
cast, the decision has been taken to transfer an 
additional €1.2 billion from the reserve to the 
health insurance institutions, increasing the 
health fund’s deficit accordingly. This transfer is 
intended to fully offset the shortfalls arising 
from the new financial relief affecting contribu -
tions to the statutory health insurance scheme payable on occupational pensions, in the first 
year that the arrangements apply. Looking 
ahead, however, this relief will have to be 
funded by SHI members through higher sup -
plementary contributions.5
Demographic pressure is set to increase in the 
longer term, with a combination of stronger 
expenditure growth and a weaker expansion of 
the revenue base. It is therefore necessary to 
curb expenditure growth (through savings or Large deficit

efficiency gains) or to raise contribution rates. 
In the present comfortable financial situation, 
new burdens can still be funded largely from 
the reserves. Yet the finances of the SHI scheme 
will come under pressure in the foreseeable fu -
ture. It is important not to lose sight of this in 
future decision- making.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
In the third quarter of 2019, a surplus of €½ 
billion was recorded in the core budget of the 
public long- term care insurance scheme,6 fol-lowing a deficit of €1 billion a year earlier. The 
main reason for this improvement was the 
sharp rise in the contribution rate, which went 
up by 0.5 percentage point to 3.05% (plus an 
extra 0.25 percentage point for childless per -
sons) at the beginning of the year.
Consequently, total revenue grew strongly by 
25½%. After adjustment for the rate increase, 
the rise came to almost 5½%. This reflects, 
above all, growth in wages and salaries as well 
as payments made by the health insurance in -
stitutions under the Care Staff Strengthening 
Act (Pflegepersonal-  Stärkungsgesetz).  Expend -
iture increased sharply, by 7%. The rise in cash 
benefits was somewhat larger, at 9%. This is 
due to the higher care allowance payments 
and pension contributions for those providing 
care for a relative. An increase of 6% was re -
corded for benefits in kind. Outlays on fully in -
patient care continued to stagnate, while 
growth in other benefits in kind (including 
home medical aids) remained strong.
For the year as a whole, the long- term care in -
surance scheme is set to post a significant sur -
plus, compared with a deficit of €3½ billion in 
2018. This is partly attributable to the contribu -
tion rate rise, which generated additional rev -
enue of €7½ billion. Looking ahead, demo -
graphic changes alone will result in considerable 
expenditure increases. The surpluses are likely 
to turn back into deficits, ultimately creating a 
need for further contribution rate increases.

net redemptions of domestic debt securities

volume of foreign debt securities in Germany 
rose by €0.8 billion during the reporting month, 
which meant that the outstanding volume of 
debt instruments in the German market de -
creased by €37.3 billion overall.
In October, the public sector redeemed debt 
securities in the amount of €24.3 billion net 
(compared with €0.5 billion in September). Ul -
timately, this was chiefly attributable to central 
government, which reduced its capital market 
debt by €19.6 billion. It mainly redeemed five- 
year Federal notes (Bobls, €16.5 billion) and 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills, €3.0 billion). 
This contrasted with net issuance of two- year 
Federal treasury notes (Schätze, €3.6 billion) 
and of ten- year and 30- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds, €2.2 billion and €1.2 billion respect -
ively). State and local government redeemed 
their own bonds worth €4.7 billion net.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt by €17.2 billion in October 
(compared with €0.7 in September). The larg -
est decline was in the outstanding volume of 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions (€13.3 billion). There were also net re -
demptions of other bank debt securities and 
public Pfandbriefe (€2.8 billion and €1.3 billion 
respectively).
By contrast, domestic enterprises increased 
their capital market debt by €3.3 billion during 
the reporting month, following €0.2 billion in 
the previous month. On balance, issuances 
were very largely attributable to other financial 
intermediaries and in nearly all cases had ma -
turities of more than one year.
On the buyers’ side, it was mainly foreign in -
vestors who reduced their holdings in the Ger -
man bond market – by €25.4 billion net – in 
the month under review. On balance, foreign investors stepped up their sales of public bonds. 
German credit institutions and non- banks sold 
debt securities for €9.0 billion and €3.5 billion 
net respectively. Only the Bundesbank acquired 
debt securities with a net value of €0.5 billion.
Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises issued €0.4 
billion worth of new shares in the German 
stock market, compared with €0.1 billion in the 
previous month. The volume of foreign equities 
in the German market rose by €10.0 billion. On 
balance, domestic non- banks were the sole 
buyers of shares (€11.4 billion), while foreign 
investors and domestic credit institutions sold 
equities for €0.9 billion and €0.2 billion net re -

Investment funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€11.6 billion in October (compared with €9.2 
billion in September). On balance, specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors were 
virtually the sole beneficiaries of such inflows 
(€11.3 billion). Among the fund providers, new 
shares were sold mainly by mixed securities-  
based funds (€4.8 billion) as well as bond funds 
(€2.5 billion), funds of funds (€2.2 billion) and 
open- end real estate funds (€2.0 billion). The 
outstanding volume of foreign mutual fund 
shares distributed in Germany increased by 
€2.0 billion during the reporting month. In Oc -
tober, mutual fund shares were purchased al -
most exclusively by domestic non- banks (€12.5 
billion). Domestic credit institutions and foreign 
investors purchased mutual fund shares worth 
€0.7 billion and €0.4 billion net respectively.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €22.7 billion in October 2019. The result was 
€2.2 billion down on the previous month’s 
level. Although the surplus in the goods ac -
count widened marginally, the surplus from in -
visible current transactions –  comprising the 
services account as well as primary and second -
ary income  – narrowed considerably more 
strongly.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account increased by €0.1 billion on the 
month to €22.5 billion, with exports of goods 
expanding somewhat more sharply than im -
ports.
Germany recorded only a slight surplus of €0.2 
billion from invisible current transactions in Oc -
tober, down from €2.5 billion in September. 
Wider deficits in the services and secondary in -
come accounts were responsible for the bulk of 
this decline. The shortfall in the services ac -
count increased by €1.1 billion to €4.3 billion, 
mainly due to higher expenditure, with heavier German mutual 
funds record

spending on IT services, in particular, outweigh -
ing the declines to which travel contributed de -
cisively. In addition, receipts contracted some -
what; here, lower income from business ser -
vices, in particular, more than offset the gains 
recorded, above all, in financial services. The 
deficit in secondary income, meanwhile, ex -
panded by €0.8 billion to €4.5 billion, largely 
on the back of lower general government rev -
enue from current taxes on income and wealth 
as well as higher government expenditure on 
current transfers relating to international co -
operation. Moreover, net receipts in primary in -
come dropped by €0.3 billion to €9.0 billion. In 
particular, this was related to the fact that divi -
dend income from portfolio investment abroad, 
which had increased in the previous month, 
shrank again in the reporting month.
In October 2019, it was primarily political news 
that influenced financial market developments. 
Events were shaped, not least, by growing 
hopes that the United Kingdom would leave 
the EU in an orderly fashion. Germany’s cross- 
border portfolio investment recorded net cap -
ital exports in the amount of €33.0 billion, up 
from €10.2 billion in September. On balance, 
non- resident investors sold domestic securities 
worth €25.8 billion, mainly offloading money 
market paper (€17.5 billion) and public sector 
bonds (€10.5 billion). Large- scale redemptions 
of domestic debt securities were a major factor 
here. To a lesser extent, non- resident investors 
also sold German shares (€0.9 billion). By con -
trast, these investors acquired both private 
bonds (€2.6 billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€0.4 billion). Domestic investors acquired for -
eign securities to the tune of €7.2 billion net, 
exhibiting an appetite for shares (€4.3 billion), 
money market paper (€2.4 billion) and mutual fund shares (€2.0 billion), but selling foreign 
bonds worth €1.6 billion.
Direct investment likewise registered net capital 
exports in October (€14.0 billion, after €1.6 bil -
lion in September). Enterprises domiciled in 
Germany channelled €12.9 billion of additional 
capital to their affiliates abroad. They boosted 
their equity capital by €11.3 billion, with just 
under half of this figure taking the form of re -
invested earnings. Furthermore, they supplied 
€1.6 billion in additional funds via intra- group 
loans. Foreign enterprises withdrew a net €1.1 
billion of foreign direct investment from Ger -
many, reducing their equity capital by €1.8 bil -
lion and granting just a small volume of add -
itional loans to affiliated enterprises (€0.7 bil -
lion).
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital imports of €21.1 billion in October, fol -
lowing net capital exports of €7.9 billion in Sep -
tember. This came largely as a result of a €51.9 
billion decline in the Bundesbank’s net claims 
on non- residents. TARGET2 claims on the ECB 
fell by €78.0 billion, but non- resident counter -
party deposits receded as well. Monetary finan -
cial institutions (excluding the Bundesbank) re -
corded net capital exports of €31.4 billion. On 
balance, enterprises’ and households’ transac -
tions with non- residents also resulted in out -
flows of funds (€6.7 billion), whereas general 
government transactions generated capital im -
ports (€7.2 billion).

Outlook for the German economy – 
 macroeconomic projections for 2020 and 
2021 and an outlook for 2022
The German economy will gradually emerge from its current lull over the projection horizon. 
Growth in domestic demand will probably not be as dynamic as it was during the boom period 
of previous years. This is due mainly to an increase in households’ real disposable income, which 
will ease primarily on the back of a significant slowdown in employment growth. However, 
exports are expected to slowly but surely shake off stagnation and go on to rise more strongly 
again over the course of 2020, in keeping with foreign demand. These developments should see 
industry pick up and the current two- speed nature of Germany’s economy become less pro -
nounced. The country’s distinctly supportive fiscal policy and highly accommodative monetary 
policy will provide an additional boost.
In this scenario, calendar- adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to grow by only 
around ½% next year, as it did this year. Economic output will then expand at a distinctly faster 
pace in 2021 and 2022. Growth could reach just under 1½% per year, which would be on much 
the same scale as potential output. Following the high levels of utilisation previously recorded, 
aggregate capacity utilisation is set to be more or less average next year. Capacity utilisation in 
Germany will remain within normal range over the remaining course of the projection horizon, 
too.
The rate of inflation, which has already decreased substantially this year, will probably sink slightly 
further still for a time next year. Falling energy prices are the main culprit here. A marked rise in 
inflation is anticipated in 2021, with energy prices set to rebound strongly, primarily in response 
to the climate measures recently adopted. Given robust wage growth overall, rising import prices 
and recovering profit margins, the projections indicate that inflation excluding energy and food 
will remain broadly unchanged at its present level. It could edge upwards to 1.6% in 2022. Head -
line inflation could then be even higher owing, above all, to the sharper rises in energy prices.
The general government surplus is expected to decrease to 1½% of GDP this year. A gradual 
reduction in the surplus is on the cards in the years ahead, driven primarily by fiscal loosening and 
the associated rise in spending. The debt ratio will remain on its downward trajectory and is 
expected to fall below 60% by 2020 at the latest.
Compared with the projections from June 2019, markedly lower economic growth is now assumed 
for 2020. In view of the downward revision of wage growth and the output gap, slightly lower 
inflation excluding energy and food is anticipated for the next two years. In 2020, the impact of 
lower energy prices on headline inflation will be amplified even further. By contrast, this will be 
almost entirely offset in 2021 by higher energy prices. For economic growth and, to a lesser 
extent, for the rate of inflation, the risks are tilted to the downside as things stand today.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy trod water in the second 
and third quarters of 2019. Adjusted for sea -
sonal and calendar effects, real GDP changed 
little during these quarters taken together.2 It 
was thus slightly lower than had been expected 
in the June outlook.3 The persistence of the 
very weak underlying cyclical trend that began 
back in mid-2018 was due, first and foremost, 
to shrinking output in the export- dependent in -
dustrial sector, which has now seen five con -
secutive quarters of contraction. Conversely, 
the more domestically oriented sectors proved 
to be resilient and continued to provide some positive impetus. They were helped by the still 
favourable income situation for employees. Al -
though the labour market is gradually begin -
ning to show signs of the effects of the eco -
nomic slowdown, it has nevertheless shown 
itself to be fairly robust on the whole. On the 
demand side, this was to the benefit of private 
consumption and private housing construction 
investment. By contrast, business investment 
contracted markedly amidst ongoing weakness 
in the export and industrial sectors.
The economic slump is likely to persist through 
the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 
2020. There is little prospect of anything more 
than a very subdued rise in GDP . However, as 
things currently stand, there is no reason to ex -
pect that Germany will slide into recession.4 On 
the contrary, the first tentative signs that indus -
try is gradually picking up are emerging. For ex -
ample, ifo Institute data suggest that business 
and export expectations in this sector have re -
cently improved somewhat. Furthermore, the 
orders situation did not deteriorate any further 
in recent months. The export- oriented indus -
trial sector could therefore stabilise before the 
domestically oriented sectors are affected to a 
greater extent. The two-  speed economy that 
has recently been shaping activity in Germany 
would then slowly become less pronounced.
The German economy will probably regain 
some momentum over the remainder of the 
projection horizon. This growth will mainly be 
driven by exports, which, over the course of 
next year, are expected to slowly but surely 
shake off stagnation and go on to increase German econ -

1 These projections for Germany were finalised on 27 No -

for the euro area published by the ECB on 12 December 
2019.
2 Real GDP fell by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019 and 
rose by 0.1% in the third quarter. It should be borne in 
mind when assessing the weak economic output observed 
in the second and third quarters of the year that it was ele -
vated in the first quarter of 2019 as a result of one- off 
factors.

more strongly, in keeping with foreign demand. 
This should help industrial activity recover, and 
business investment is likely – albeit with a cer -
tain time lag – to return to marked growth. Do -
mestic demand will remain on a steep upward 
trajectory, though growth will not be as strong 
as it was during the boom period of previous 
years. Germany’s distinctly expansionary fiscal 
policy, coupled with a monetary policy which is 
likewise supportive, will provide an additional 
boost. At the same time, however, households’ 
real disposable income will increase at a slower 
rate than in previous years, largely on account 
of less dynamic employment growth. As a re -
sult, growth in private consumption will prob -
ably be markedly weaker in the coming years 
than it was this year. Housing construction in -
vestment, too, is likely to see only moderate 
growth.
All in all, the situation paints the picture of a 
“soft landing” for the German economy, after 
which the economy will return to growth at 
rates close to those for potential output. Fol -
lowing an increase of only around ½% this year 
and again next year, calendar- adjusted real 
GDP could be markedly higher again in the two 
years thereafter, growing at a rate of just under 
1½% per year (see the table on p. 16).5 Com -
pared with the June outlook, a considerably 
lower rate of GDP growth is therefore clearly 
on the cards for next year (see the adjacent 
table). The main reason for this is that global 
demand developed more unfavourably than 
anticipated and is now being assessed as 
weaker going ahead, too. This is reflected in 
distinctly lower expectations for exports and 
business investment.
According to these projections, Germany’s eco -
nomic output will fall considerably short of po -
tential output not only this year but also next 
year. Aggregate capacity utilisation, which was 
still significantly above average in 2018, will 
therefore normalise. In 2021 and 2022, eco -
nomic output could then grow more or less in 
line with potential output.6 As a result, capacity GDP growth in 
2020 likely to be 
considerably 
weaker than

5 Without adjusting for calendar effects, the growth rate 
for 2020 will be considerably higher, at 1.0%, as that year 
has more working days than 2019. There will be a slightly 
negative calendar effect in 2022 (see the table on p. 23).
6 The growth rate of potential output for 2019 is put at 
1.5%. It is likely to fall to 1.3% in the years thereafter 
owing to the demographically driven decline in the poten -

utilisation in Germany will probably remain 
within normal range.
Since the start of 2018, the underlying trend 
for German exports has been very weak, with 
brief upward and downward fluctuations being 
observed time and again. However, the first 
tentative signs of a possible end to this slump 
are now emerging. For example, despite re -
maining stuck in negative territory, ifo export 
expectations three months ahead bottomed 
out at their lowest point to date in September.7 
Furthermore, the underlying trend dynamics of 
new orders received from abroad by German 
industry, i.e. not taking account of volatile large 
orders, have emerged from a protracted de -
cline and have now stabilised. In the absence 
of any further setbacks relating to foreign de -
mand, it is assumed that export growth will 
gradually recover over the course of 2020. This 
recovery is likely to continue in the years there -
after, with exports rising roughly in line with 
the expected gradual strengthening of sales 
market growth. Over the remainder of the pro -
jection horizon, exports will probably grow at a 
pace only slightly slower than that of foreign 
demand. A certain reduction compared with 
the rate of sales market growth is to be ex -
pected for exports to other euro area coun -
tries. This is to take into account losses in Ger -
man exporters’ competitiveness owing to com -
paratively high domestic cost pressures.
Lagging somewhat behind the downturn in in -
dustry, business investment decreased mark -
edly in the second and third quarters of 2019 
– the first contraction since 2016. This decline 
is likely to continue initially, as evidenced by the 
still shrinking level of capacity utilisation in 
manufacturing and, in the short term, ongoing 
weak foreign demand for German industrial 
goods. Furthermore, the business environment Exports set

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. They are based 
on information available as at 19 November 
2019. The assumptions regarding economic 
activity in the euro area are derived from 
projections made by the national central 
banks of the euro area countries.1 These 
projections incorporate all fi  scal policy 
measures which have been either adopted 
or adequately specifi  ed and are deemed 
likely to be implemented.
Outlook for global trade lagging behind 
muted global economic growth
The slight acceleration in the pace of global 
economic growth (excluding the euro area) 
anticipated in the June projection did not 
materialise in the second and third quarters 
of 2019. At this point, a somewhat faster 
momentum is not expected until next year, 
the pace of which will then pick up only 
marginally over the further course of the 
projection period. The growth momentum 
of the advanced economies (excluding the 
euro area) will slacken slightly as a result of 
increasingly mature economic cycles, 
mounting supply- side restrictions and the 
diminishing impact of expansionary monet-
ary and fi  scal policies.2 In addition, the 
growth rates anticipated for China will be 
low by historical standards. However, taken 
as a whole, the group of emerging market 
economies will largely be in tune with the 
increasing momentum assumed for several 
Asian and Latin American economies. All in 
all, annual growth rates for the global econ-
omy (excluding the euro area and weighted 
by purchasing power parity) should be just 
under 3% for this year and just over 3% for 
next year, while expansion rates for 2021 and 2022 are expected to come to 3¼% 
and 3½% respectively.
Weak industrial and investment activity,3 as 
well as trade disputes, will continue to place 
a strain on international trade. In the second 
and third quarters of 2019, global trade 
continued to weaken slightly and was thus 
considerably below the expectations of the 
June projection. Global trade (excluding the 
euro area) is expected to make a very muted 
recovery over the projection horizon. Fol-
lowing what was – averaged across the cur-
rent year – a stagnation, growth rates of 
¾% for 2020, 2½% for 2021 and 2¾% for 
2022 are expected. Hence global trade will 
remain even less dynamic than global activ-
ity at the end of the projection period. 
Compared with June, the projections for 
global trade have therefore been revised 
downwards by a more considerable margin 
than the outlook for the global economy. 
German exporters’ sales markets likewise 
showed only weak growth over the course 
of 2019 and, similar to global trade, a 
muted growth momentum is expected over 
the projection horizon.
1 The projections made by the national central banks 
of the euro area countries were completed on 27 No-
vember 2019.
2 As in past projections, it is assumed, with regard to 
the United Kingdom’s planned withdrawal from the 
EU, that no tariffs will be imposed before the end of 
2020. In the short term, the uncertainty about the im-
plementation of the decision to leave the EU will 
weigh, above all, on the UK’s economic activity. Like-
wise, over the further course of the projection horizon, 
economic growth is likely to remain subdued during a 
transitional phase towards a new trade agreement.
3 Shifts in the composition of global demand may also 
be one of the factors weighing heavily on global trade. 
Whereas the industrial sector, which is export- oriented 
and produces capital goods, is suffering from weak in-
vestment activity, the services sector, which is driven 
more by household demand, is comparatively robust.

Technical assumptions of the projection
After the June projection had been fi  nal-
ised, crude oil prices receded perceptibly. 
Given the apprehension about a further es-
calation of trade disputes and sluggish in-
dustrial activity, global oil demand was ex-
pected to weaken yet again. Despite the 
counterweight provided by tensions in the 
Middle East and concerns about ongoing 
production losses following an attack on oil refineries in Saudi Arabia, stoking 
expectations  of a shorter supply, price- 
dampening factors on the demand side pre-
vailed. The assumptions underlying the pro-
jections are derived from forward quota-
tions, which indicate a somewhat stronger 
decline in crude oil prices in the coming 
year than assumed in the June projection. 
Overall, this equates to a considerably lower 
level of crude oil prices over the full projec-
tion horizon. The prices for other commod-
ities measured in US dollars likewise dropped 
after the June projection was fi  nalised, 
pushing down their average for 2019. In 
light of the expected recovery of the global 
economy, moderate price increases are an-
ticipated for the following years; however, 
these, too, are likely to be below the mo-
mentum assumed in the June projection.
The Governing Council of the ECB already 
adjusted its forward guidance on key inter-
est rates at its monetary policy meetings in 
June and July. Then, at the September 
meeting, a comprehensive package of 
measures was adopted. This involved re-
suming monthly net purchases under the 
expanded asset purchase programme (APP) 
of €20 billion as from 1 November 2019. 
These purchases are to end only shortly be-
fore key interest rates are set to be raised. 
Key interest rates are to remain at their 
present or lower levels until the infl  ation 
outlook for the euro area has robustly con-
verged to a level suffi   ciently close to, but 
below, 2% within the projection horizon, 
and such convergence has been refl  ected in 
core infl  ation dynamics. In addition, at the 
September meeting the interest rate on the 
deposit facility was lowered by 10 basis 
points and the monetary policy stance loos-
ened further by adjusting the modalities of 
the targeted longer- term refi  nancing oper-
ations (TLTRO III).4 Market expectations re-

garding a future interest rate hike have 
shifted further into the future as compared 
with the assumptions of the June projec-
tion. Based on the current lower level, it is 
assumed that the EURIBOR and the yield on 
long- term German government bonds will 
record minor gains only towards the end of 
the projection horizon. Consistent with 
technical interest rate assumptions, bank 
lending rates, too, are expected to record 
only a very moderate increase until 2022. 
Financing conditions are, therefore, ex-
pected to be extremely advantageous 
across the projection horizon. Accordingly, 
the percentage of enterprises citing fi  nan-
cing diffi   culties as a risk to their business 
growth reached a new all- time low, accord-
ing to the economic survey conducted by 
the Association of German Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (DIHK) in the au-
tumn of 2019.
The extensive additional easing measures of 
the single monetary policy and unexpect-
edly weak economic data for the euro area 
dampened the value of the single currency 
against the US dollar following the fi  nalisa-
tion of the June projection. The US dollar 
was also strengthened by the fact that mar-
ket participants viewed further interest rate 
cuts by the Federal Reserve System as less 
likely. The euro was trading at US$1.10 in 
the period relevant to the derivation of the 
exchange rate assumptions. Compared with 
the assumptions of the June projection, the 
euro depreciated by around 1¾% against 
the US dollar. In relation to the most im-
portant currencies for foreign trade, the 
euro depreciated by ¾% on balance.
Gradually stronger GDP growth
in the euro area
The current weakness of global trade and 
uncertainty regarding future trade relations 
are weighing on euro area economic growth. This has dampened industrial 
growth in particular, whereas the services 
sector has shown itself to be more resilient 
thus far. Against the backdrop of further ex-
pected employment growth and rising 
wages, it is anticipated that domestic 
growth forces will continue to counterbal-
ance weak foreign trade. With the muted 
recovery of non- euro area trading partners’ 
import demand, which is factored into the 
assumptions on global trade, export growth 
is likely to pick up again as well. In 2021 
and 2022, the euro area economy is likely 
to return to growth rates that are some-
what above potential growth.
Compared with the June projection, ex-
pected GDP growth in the euro area for 
2020 (excluding Germany) was revised 
downwards by around two-tenths of a per-
centage point to 1.3%, following 1.5% for 
2019. For each of the next two years, a 
growth rate of 1.4% is assumed, represent-
ing an unchanged projection for 2021 com-
pared with the June projection.
Considerably looser fi  scal policy
Fiscal policy in Germany is set to be loos-
ened considerably over the entire projection 
horizon, supporting economic activity. The 
fi  scal policy measures will weigh on the 
government budgets for 2020 and 2021, in 
particular. Additional spending has been 
agreed in many areas. Central, state and 
local governments, in particular, are plan-
ning additional spending on transport and 
digital infrastructures, childcare and educa-
tion, as well as external and internal secur-
ity. Furthermore, measures to curb CO ₂ 
emissions will be promoted more heavily as 
from 2020 (for more information, see 
p. 32).
The various income tax cuts, in particular in 
the form of the partial abolition of the soli-Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2019  
21

in which enterprises are operating remains 
fraught with heightened economic uncertainty. 
This pertains, inter alia, to the simmering trade 
disputes between the United States and its 
trading partners, and to the issue of future 
technological and regulatory framework condi -
tions relating to matters such as mobility. Low 
financing costs are unlikely to provide a suffi -
cient counterweight here. As a result, business 
investment is expected, on average, to experi -
ence a further marked decline next year. If, 
spurred by recovering exports, industrial activ -
ity picks up as assumed, it is likely that, initially, 
the utilisation of available capacity will increase. 
Consequently, enterprises’ propensity to invest 
will probably respond with a certain time lag, 
as was the case at the start of the economic 
downturn. On an annual average, business in -
vestment is unlikely to expand again until 2021. 
As things stand today, this growth could even 
accelerate in 2022: export business is set to 
keep picking up, and it could then be possible to gradually make up for investment measures 
previously put on ice.
Despite the ongoing economic slowdown, 
consumer sentiment in Germany is still positive. 
Looking ahead over the projection horizon, 
too, private consumption is likely to remain a 
major mainstay of economic growth. It is an -
ticipated that consumer spending will rise on a 
scale similar to disposable income. However, 
real disposable income looks set to increase at 
a slower rate than during the boom period of 
previous years. This is down to a variety of fac -
tors which, in some cases, will act in opposite 
directions. Income dynamics will be dented, in 
particular, by the significant slowdown in em -
ployment growth. On top of this, wage growth 
will probably be slightly lower, most notably in 
2020, than the average of previous years. Look -
ing at prices, there will be some relief next year, 
but higher inflation rates are expected to return 
in 2021 and 2022. Fiscal policy will boost dis -Private

set by additional revenues from progressive 
taxation. In addition, revenue is to increase 
further from 2021 owing to the new allow-
ances for CO ₂ emissions in the areas of 
transport and building heating agreed as 
part of the package of climate measures. As 
regards social contributions, the contribu-
tion rate to the unemployment insurance 
scheme will be lowered by 0.1 percentage 
point to 2.4% next year. Moreover, there 
will be relief for occupational pension re-
cipients regarding their contributions to the 
statutory health insurance scheme. This will 
increase the pressure to raise the additional 
contributions to statutory health insurers – 
a move which is expected in any case on 
account of the healthcare cost dynamics. 
Overall, it is assumed that the average rates 
of additional contributions will increase 
markedly. All in all, surpluses and shortfalls on the revenue side will largely balance 
each other out between 2020 and 2022.Deutsche Bundesbank

posable income, especially when the solidarity 
surcharge is partially abolished in 2021.
Housing construction investment has risen 
sharply so far this year, and is likely to pick up 
once more in the fourth quarter. The optimistic 
sentiment amongst enterprises and the well-  
filled order books suggest that the boom in the 
construction sector will continue in the next 
few months. For housing construction in par -
ticular, demand remained high in principle on 
account of the stable labour market and ex -
tremely favourable financing conditions.8 
Nevertheless, starting from this high level, 
housing construction investment will probably 
then see only moderate growth over the pro -
jection horizon. First, construction prices are 
continuing to rise strongly, albeit at a some -
what slower pace. This suggests that, even 
given the weaker demand from the industrial 
sector for construction work at present, it is 
not easy to expand construction capacity on 
the supply side due to the tight labour market. 
This trend is set to continue. Second, housing 
construction investment is likely to lose steam 
due to demand- side factors. Aside from the 
waning momentum in real disposable income, 
the diminishing number of new households will 
also be a factor here. Demographic trends and 
the expected dip in immigration levels will also 
contribute to this.
House price dynamics abated in the first half of 
2019. In particular, the exceptionally high 
house price inflation in metropolitan areas up 
to 2018 eased up considerably. Demand for 
housing grew more slowly, likely also because 
of the price level that has now been reached. 
In some cases, it has also shifted away from 
cities to areas where prices have risen less 
strongly and supply can be expanded more 
easily. This trend will probably continue. The 
expected development of macroeconomic indi -
cators, such as the slowing momentum in real 
disposable incomes, likewise points to more 
moderate inflation rates for houses than was 
previously the case. Nevertheless, inflation rates will probably level off only gradually given the 
typical price inelasticity of housing.
Direct government demand will bolster eco -
nomic growth markedly over the projection 
horizon, supported by government consump -
tion as well as government investment. Gov -
ernment consumption has risen perceptibly this 
year, and growth is likely to remain above GDP 
growth next year, particularly in tangible goods 
purchases as well as in healthcare and long-  
term care spending. Government investment, 
too, is likely to see a distinct increase. Priority 
areas will include transport and digital infra -
structures, childcare and schools. Capacity con -
straints in the construction sector are expected 
to curb government investment in construction 
somewhat less strongly than in the recent past, 
and price pressures could abate somewhat. 
This is due mainly to the less pronounced rises 
in commercial demand. Major increases in in -
vestment in machinery and equipment in the 
defence sector are also probable.
Imports, after a period of buoyancy, did not 
grow any further over the second and third 
quarters. This lull is likely to be linked to the Moderate

current weakness in exports and business in -
vestment, both of which involve imports to a 
significant degree. The recent pronounced level 
of destocking probably also contributed to this. 
By contrast, robust domestic demand generally 
provided buoyancy. The projections for the 
various demand components reveal an initially 
subdued outlook for imports in the fourth 
quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. 
They are expected to expand rather strongly as 
time progresses, however, supported by the 
anticipated stronger export growth and the re -
bound in business investment. Moreover, the 
integration of Germany’s economy into the 
international division of labour is still expected 
to increase at least moderately in the medium 
term in spite of the present challenges facing 
the global trade system. It is therefore assumed 
that the import shares of all demand compon -
ents will continue to rise. Euro area trading 
partners should benefit in particular from Ger -
many’s rising import demand given their in -
creasing price competitiveness.
Despite weak exports, Germany’s current ac -
count surplus for the first nine months of this 
year was somewhat above the high level of 
2018. In addition to the distinct improvement 
in the terms of trade as a result of the lower 
crude oil price, this was also attributable to the 
higher primary income balance. The latter was 
pushed up by increased investment income 
linked to the rise in Germany’s net external 
position. By contrast, current account surpluses 
are set to narrow over the projection horizon. 
The terms of trade will probably see, if at all, 
only a slight further improvement on average 
over the coming year based on assumptions re -
garding the crude oil price and the euro ex -
change rate. It is assumed that net primary and 
secondary income will expand largely in line 
with nominal GDP growth. The projections for 
real trade flows are the main driver here: 
though export growth has been gradually re -
covering, imports have consistently grown dis -
tinctly more strongly on the back of robust do -
mestic activity, meaning that the trade surplus 
will gradually fall. The total current account Imports weak

balance could decline to 7.4% of nominal GDP 
by 2021, and then continue to decrease slightly.
Labour market
The labour market proved to be fairly resilient 
in the second and third quarters of 2019 in the 
face of the ongoing cyclical downturn. Never -
theless, employment growth has waned con -
siderably over the last two quarters. After going 
up in the last quarter of 2018 and the first 
quarter of 2019 by 260,000 after seasonal ad -
justment, total employment managed an in -
crease of another 60,000 in the second and 
third quarters of 2019. Only temporary agency 
work saw a decrease in employment. Tempor -
ary employees are chiefly deployed in the in -
dustrial sector, which has been especially af -
fected by the downturn. Enterprises largely 
maintained their core staff in the face of exist -
ing labour shortages and accepted lower la -
bour productivity. The average number of hours 
worked likewise fell. This probably took the 
form, in particular, of overtime being reduced 
and positive balances on working time ac -
counts being scaled back. Moreover, short- time 
work caused by cyclical developments rose 
somewhat, although it still remained at a rela -
tively low level. Overall, the total number of 
hours worked declined slightly in the last two 
quarters. As expected, unemployment re -
mained at its low level in recent months, but 
did not fall any further.9
There is unlikely to be much change in the 
overall favourable labour market situation in 
the next few months. Employment is expected 
to continue to rise slightly on the whole, also 
because firms in the sectors hit hardest by the 
cyclical weakness remain determined to largely 
avoid dismissing their core workforces. Instead, 
they are likely to resort to other options such as 
reduced working hours, short- time work and 
less temporary work in the final quarter of 2019 
and the first quarter of 2020 as well. However, 
leading indicators are pointing to a marginal 
uptick in unemployment. Employment and underemployment may increase at the same 
time because the labour force will expand 
again somewhat.
It is presumed that the expected firming of 
economic activity will be accompanied again 
by stable labour demand in the medium term. 
The labour supply is unlikely to increase, in con -
trast to before. Labour force participation in 
Germany is already very high by international 
standards and is unlikely to rise to the same 
extent as it has done over the past decade. The 
shift in the age structure towards age groups 
with low participation rates will also have a 
dampening effect. Immigration, particularly

origin for the labour market), has already been 
decreasing for some time now. This decline has 
been amplified even further recently. Following 
total net immigration of 386,000 persons in 
2018, on balance only 320,000 are set to have 
migrated to Germany this year. As in Germany, 
demographic change is also being felt in the 
most significant countries of origin, and the la -
bour markets in these countries are becoming 
tighter and tighter. Annual net immigration of 
300,000 is expected in subsequent years. This 
will have an impact on the size of the labour 
force, which had still been growing consider -
ably in past years. After a small rise in 2020 and 
2021, it is expected to decline in 2022.
Employment growth is unlikely to strengthen 
even after the current economic slump has 
come to an end. The employees retained dur -
ing the downturn are expected to be deployed 
more productively at first, meaning that un -
employment is not set to fall, either. This is 
underscored by the fact that the low level of 
unemployment will probably limit the scope for 
any further increase in employment in any 
event. Employment will grow only slightly in 
2021 and may then decline somewhat, parallel -
ing the size of the labour force. The number of 
working hours per employed person is ex -
pected to increase again moderately towards 
the end of the projection horizon. At this point, the impact of the cyclical recovery will out -
weigh the dampening effect of the change in 
age structure. The total number of hours 
worked could therefore increase slightly in 
2022 as well.
Labour costs and prices
Negotiated pay rates will probably rise less 
strongly in 2020 than this year or in 2018. The 
downturn in the industrial sector is likely to re -
sult in fewer new agreements entered into by 
wage bargainers. The effects of the second 
round of lower (or even non-  existent) incre -
mental increases under old, long-  running col -
lective wage agreements such as in the metal- 
working and electrical engineering industries 
will also continue to be felt. Both are set to 
dampen the growth of negotiated pay rates 
markedly in 2020.10
The year 2021 is expected to bring with it fa -
vourable conditions for wage bargainers to 
agree much stronger wage increases again. 
The German economy is likely to expand again 
more rapidly, labour productivity will rebound 
more strongly and tightness in the labour mar -
ket will remain high. As things stand today, 
these trends will gain some further momentum 
in 2022, giving support to slightly stronger 
wage growth.
The rise in actual earnings is likely to follow a 
similar time pattern, although the dip in 2020 
will probably be somewhat more pronounced. 
This is because wage drift is unlikely to be at all 
positive, particularly in 2020. Performance bo -

are expected to decline slightly.11 The return to 
a solid path of growth will mean that employ -
ees will work somewhat more hours in 2021 
and firms will award their employees slightly 
higher bonuses. From a macroeconomic per -
spective, the increases in the statutory min -
imum wage will give only a limited boost to 
average wages.
Compensation per employee, which includes 
employers’ social contributions on top of ac -
tual earnings, will likewise see much smaller 
growth in 2020 than in 2019. The return to full 
joint financing of the statutory health insurance 
scheme contributed to the especially high rise 
this year.12 By contrast, the contribution rate to 
the unemployment insurance scheme will be 
reduced slightly at the beginning of 2020. In 
the following years, labour costs are expected 
to grow more strongly again in line with actual 
earnings, with average supplementary contri -
bution rates to statutory health insurance insti -
tutions rising markedly.
Unit labour costs are expected to lose consider -
able momentum in the coming year following 
another probable significant increase in 2019. 
This is chiefly due to the expectation that la -
bour productivity will rise substantially once 
more, alongside weaker wage growth. Weak 
productivity developments at present are, first 
and foremost, a reflection of employment 
growth, which has thus far remained fairly 
sound in comparison with sluggish economic 
growth. With the firming of the economy an -
ticipated for the coming year, productivity is ex -
pected to swing onto a path of recovery. This is 
likely to continue into 2021 and 2022. A tan -
gible increase in the capital intensity of labour 
as a factor of production will be a further bol -
stering factor here: supply- side constraints will 
curb employment gains, whilst at the same 
time fixed capital formation will experience 
solid growth. Increasing labour productivity will 
then give rise to further decreasing growth 
rates for unit labour costs amid renewed higher 
wage growth. This should cause aggregate 
profit margins, too, to return in part to normal. In the current economic downturn, they have 
thus far absorbed the strong unit labour  cost 
growth to a significant extent, and have there -
fore been highly compressed. On balance, do -
mestic inflation as measured by the GDP defla -
tor, which already saw a marked increase this 
year, is set to record a similarly high rate in sub -
sequent years.
Compared with the final quarter of 2018 and 
the first quarter of 2019, consumer price infla -
tion as measured by the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP) declined considerably 
in the second and third quarters of 2019. This 
was more or less in line with the expectations 
of the June projection.13 Prices for food, includ -
ing beverages and tobacco, increased more 
steeply than anticipated, not least on account 
of an unexpected rise in tobacco prices. At the 
same time, the prices of package holidays, and,

11 Moreover, positive balances on working time accounts 
and the volume of unpaid overtime will be reduced, espe -
cially in the industrial sector. However, this is reflected nei -
ther in monthly wages nor, therefore, in the wage drift, 
which is measured on a monthly basis.
12 The cut in the contribution rate to the unemployment 
insurance scheme and the simultaneous rise in the contri -
bution rate to the public long- term care insurance scheme 
at the beginning of 2019 will cancel each other out from 
the employer’s perspective.

ally at the level projected in June.Deutsche Bundesbank

less than had been assumed. For this reason, 
the rate excluding energy and food temporarily 
fell short of the level projected in June. If the 
volatile travel and clothing components are 
also factored out, however, the prices have 
risen rather dynamically, as expected.
In the coming year, the inflation rate excluding 
energy and food (core inflation) is anticipated 
to rise slightly. This is chiefly on account of the 
prices of services, which will probably increase 
much more steeply. An additional factor here is 
the absence of a dampening statistical effect in 
prices for package holidays.14 Industrial goods 
prices (excluding energy) already rose strongly in 2019, which can probably also be attributed 
to the depreciation of the euro. As the ex -
change rate is expected to remain unchanged, 
price inflation over the projection horizon is not 
likely to remain quite as high. However, it is still 
set to be significantly higher than the average 
of the past few years. On the whole, the core 
inflation rate could initially remain virtually un -
changed, increasing slightly further towards 
the end of the projection horizon. Although 
cyclical normalisation, taken in isolation, will 
probably curb inflation with a time lag, wage 
growth is expected to remain comparatively 
strong amid rising import prices. Moreover, 
past burdens in the form of higher labour costs 
are likely to be gradually passed on to con -
sumers, with the result that profit margins will 
recover.
This year, and presumably next year, too, the 
rise in food prices will be dampened somewhat 
by declining prices for some agricultural prod -
ucts. Once this trend tails off, robust wage 
growth in this area is expected to be passed 
through more strongly to prices again. Energy 
prices saw only moderate growth this year on 
account of falling oil prices. A further decrease 
in the latter is assumed over the projection 
horizon. For this reason, energy is likely to 
make a negative contribution to the inflation 
rate in 2020. As from 2021, by contrast, meas -
ures enshrined in the recently adopted climate 
package will push up prices (for more informa -
tion, see the box on pp. 29 ff.). Moreover, in -
creased procurement costs in the electricity 
market are likely to be passed on to final con -
sumers. Energy prices will then resume making 
a significant contribution to consumer price in -
flation.
Overall, therefore, the inflation rate could tem -
porarily decline further in the coming year, 
from 1.4% to 1.3%, before going back up to 
1.6% in 2021. In 2022, a further increase ap -
pears possible due to a sharper rise in energy 
prices and the slight pick- up in the core rate. Core inflation

The impact of the Climate Package on economic growth 
and infl  ation
In mid- November 2019, the Bundestag 
passed a Climate Package comprising the 
Federal Climate Action Act (Bundesklima-
schutzgesetz) and further climate legisla-
tion.1 The measures envisaged in this pack-
age will affect consumer prices and eco-
nomic growth over and beyond the fore-
cast horizon. This box provides an 
assessment of these effects.
Under the Federal Climate Action Act, VAT 
payable on long- distance train journeys is 
to be lowered from the standard rate of 
19% to a reduced rate of 7% from 2020 
onwards. The air traffi   c tax is to be in-
creased from April 2020.2 These two meas-
ures are likely to have almost no net impact 
on infl  ation (as measured by the Harmon-
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)). This 
is because, fi  rst, their effects run in opposite 
directions and thus roughly balance each 
other out and, second, the share of these 
services in the HICP basket is low.3 In the 
areas of building heating and transport, 
moreover, the new legislation will require 
enterprises selling heating fuel and fuel for 
vehicles to purchase allowances for CO₂   
emissions, beginning in 2021. The legisla-
tion envisages that the fi  xed prices for the 
allowances will begin at €10 per tonne and 
gradually increase to €35 per tonne in 
2025. After that, the price for the allow-
ances will be dictated by the market, with a 
price span of €35 to €60 per tonne stipu-
lated for 2026. This is likely to have a 
marked impact on consumer prices for en-
ergy and on consumer prices overall, thus 
also affecting the economy as a whole.
Our fi  rst step, therefore, is to estimate 
purely mechanically the likely direct impact 
of the climate measures on the energy components of the HICP . The CO ₂ allow-
ances in the area of transport will mainly 
affect the consumer price component 
“fuels” (which can be broken down into 
diesel and petrol), while the allowances for 
building heating will have the greatest im-
pact on the components “liquid fuels” and 
“gas”.4 Each of these products entails a dif-
ferent amount of CO₂  emissions, which 
means that the price mark- ups resulting 
from the CO₂  fi  xed prices will differ. In 
2021, for instance, petrol and diesel will ex-
perience a mark- up of just under and just 
over 2½ cent per litre respectively, whereas 
gas will undergo a mark- up of 0.2 cent per 
kilowatt hour. In the calculations that fol-
low, it is assumed that the envisaged max-
imum CO₂ emissions price of €60 per tonne 
will be reached in 2026.5 In that case, the 
mark- up for fuels would rise to around 15 
cent per litre and the mark- up for gas would 
increase to just over 1 cent per kilowatt 
hour. To compensate for this, the Climate 
Package envisages a reduction in the re-
newable energy levy, which is a major cost 
component of household electricity prices.
1 However, during its session at the end of November, 
the Bundesrat referred several of the proposed meas-
ures to the parliamentary mediation committee, not-
ably the reduction of VAT payable on long- distance 
train tickets, the increase in the standard travel allow-
ance and the tax incentives for the restoration of build-
ings.
2 This amounts to an increase of between roughly 
45% and 75% depending on fl  ight distance.
3 This year, long- distance rail travel and air travel each 
account for only around ½% of the HICP . Without the 
reduction in VAT on long- distance rail travel, the 
change to the air traffi   c tax would slightly increase the 
HICP .
4 The component “heat energy” is omitted here as its 
share in the HICP is close to zero.
5 The effects calculated here should therefore be inter-
preted as an upper limit for the direct price impact 
under the assumed underlying conditions.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2019  
29

To calculate the direct impact on consumer 
prices as a whole, the respective CO₂ mark- 
ups are added to the average prices paid by 
fi  nal consumers for the individual energy 
components. For instance, if a litre of petrol 
costs €1.19 excluding VAT, as it did in Octo-
ber 2019, the price including the 2021 CO₂ 
mark- up would be over €1.21. It is assumed 
that enterprises will pass the mark- ups 
through in full and that demand for individ-
ual energy sources will be price inelastic in 
the short term. These prices are subject to 
19% VAT, meaning that in this example the 
fi  nal consumer would pay €1.42 without 
the CO₂  mark- up and €1.45 with it. This 
amounts to a 2% rise.6 A similar calculation 
can be performed for the other energy 
components. In the case of electricity, it 
should be borne in mind that the renew-
able energy subsidy is to be lowered under 
the new legislation. If the results are 
weighted with the respective shares of the 
energy components in the HICP basket, 
energy  prices will increase by a net total of 
just over 2% in both 2021 and 2022. With 
energy weighted at just over 10% of the 
HICP , in purely arithmetical terms, headline 
infl  ation should rise by around one- quarter 
percentage point in each of those years. 
While a smaller impact on consumer prices 
is likely in the years 2023 to 2025 because of the lower increase in allowance prices, 
the effect in 2026, at around 0.6 percent-
age point, would be much more noticeable 
if the allowances do in fact rise from €35 to 
€60 per tonne.
The introduction of and gradual increase in 
the CO₂  price could also have a direct impact 
on consumer prices excluding energy via 
additional costs for intermediate consump-
tion in areas such as transport.7 However, 
these costs account for only a small share of 
total production costs. All in all, introducing 
a CO ₂ price should therefore have a very 
limited direct impact on consumer prices ex-
cluding energy. The same should be true of 
the change to the vehicle tax on new pas-
senger car registrations, which is planned for 
2021 and will raise the tax rate for motor 
vehicles with emissions exceeding certain 
thresholds. Nonetheless, the share of vehicle 
tax payments in the HICP basket is not par-
ticularly high, and neither is the share of new 
passenger car registrations in the total num-
ber of passenger cars.
6 The rate of increase may vary somewhat according 
to the initial price to which the CO₂ mark- up is added. 
If this initial price were very high, the rate would be 
somewhat lower.
7 Heat generation in large industrial plants is not af-
fected by this measure, as it is already included in the 
European emissions trading system.CO₂ emissions and price mark-up per energy component in the

In a second step, we calculate the possible 
macroeconomic effects of higher energy 
prices due to the planned CO₂ mark- ups. To 
enable us to factor in indirect effects and 
macroeconomic interactions, we carry out 
simulations with the Bundesbank’s macroe-
conometric model. The price mark- ups for 
the HICP energy component derived purely 
mechanically from a disaggregated analysis 
of individual energy sources are incorpor-
ated into the model.8 In addition, the calcu-
lations take account of the fact that, as well 
as households, enterprises also face higher 
energy costs for transport and building 
heating.9
The mark- up on consumer prices has a 
dampening effect on households’ purchas-
ing power. Together with real disposable in-
come, consumer spending falls below its 
baseline level without carbon pricing. In 
addition, higher domestic prices lead to an 
increase in wages, thus weakening the inter-
national competitiveness of the German 
economy. As a result, exports remain below 
their starting level in the scenario without 
price mark- ups.10 The higher energy costs in 
the corporate sector will probably provide 
incentives to substitute energy input by cap-
ital input and thus encourage higher invest-
ment expenditure. On the whole, however, 
this is outweighed by overall lower aggre-
gate demand related to private consump-
tion and exports having a dampening effect 
on business investment. According to the 
simulation results, growth in real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) will be dampened in 
2021 and 2022 overall. Taken together, the 
level of GDP up until 2022 will be roughly 
one-and-a-half-tenths of a percent lower 
than the baseline level in a scenario without 
the additional CO₂ price mark- ups.11 The 
consequences for the affected enterprises of 
the higher cost burden, which are likewise 
incorporated, play only a minor role in the 
simulation in terms of GDP and prices.12 The macroeconomic interactions are also very 
limited with respect to infl  ation, not least 
because consumer prices show only little re-
action to somewhat weaker economic out-
put. The simulations do not take into ac-
count the desired long- term positive effects 
on economic growth related to climate ac-
tion of a timely adjustment to changed 
global conditions. Technological leadership 
in selected climate- relevant areas appears 
more likely by making a rapid adjustment 
than by adopting a wait- and- see stance. 
These effects cannot be simulated in the 
chosen model framework, however.
In a third step, we take into account that, 
along with the measures stated above, the 
Climate Package contains further projects 
for promoting climate action. Additional ex-
penditure in this respect is to be fi  nanced 
8 The model’s behavioural equation for the HICP en-
ergy component does not distinguish between differ-
ent energy sources. The most important determinant is 
the oil price in euro, including all taxes. The energy tax 
is set as a weighted average of the taxes levied on the 
individual energy sources. The price mark- up used for 
the simulation calculations is also computed as a 
weighted average and applied as a mark- up on the 
– volume- related – energy tax. This mark- up is also as-
sumed to be passed through in full to prices paid by 
households. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019f) for an 
overview of how the price block of the macroecono-
metric model is put together.
9 To achieve this, the relevant factor prices were in-
creased by an exogenous factor. This is derived from 
the mark- up relevant to consumer prices but takes ac-
count of the fact that enterprises are only partly af-
fected by the adopted carbon pricing legislation.
10 This analysis assumes that the macroeconomic im-
pact in the above scenario does not provoke a Euro-
pean monetary policy response and that bilateral ex-
change rates between the euro and other currencies 
do not react. Irrespective of this, the loss of price com-
petitiveness could be smaller than reported here. For 
example, it is assumed here that the rise in consumer 
prices has a negative effect on enterprises’ competi-
tiveness. If this assumption is relaxed, the decline in 
exports is weaker.
11 Further studies with results of a similar magnitude 
may be found in the literature, although other coun-
tries are considered. For such an overview, see German 
Council of Economic Experts (2019).
12 This is not surprising insofar as, according to Bun-
desbank estimates, the share of energy in the produc-
tion costs is merely around 3% at the macroeconomic 
level.Deutsche Bundesbank

out of the energy and climate fund, which 
receives revenues generated from the CO₂ 
mark- ups on energy prices. These could in-
clude subsidies related to the purchase of 
electric cars and the provision of battery 
charging infrastructure, for example. The 
detailed use of revenues is not yet defi  ned 
in such a way as to enable precise conclu-
sions to be drawn about the extent to 
which individual sectors will have additional 
scope for expenditure. First of all, house-
holds are likely to receive further funding 
(including tax breaks), and the corporate 
sector may well also benefi  t from new gov-
ernment investment incentives. In addition, 
the government itself will probably use 
money from the energy and climate fund to 
raise its expenditure for climate action 
measures. Overall, the energy and climate 
fund’s expenditure and tax incentives 
should boost aggregate demand and thus 
counteract the dampening effects of higher 
energy prices.A further simulation using the macroecono-
metric model therefore assumed that an-
nual income from carbon pricing is of the 
same size as the outfl  ows from the fund.13 
Moreover, the simulation takes into account 
additional government expenditure meas-
ures which are already envisaged in budget 
planning for the coming year and which are 
derived from the energy and climate fund. 
The macroeconomic impact of the add-
itional expenditure depends on their spe-
cifi  c design. Higher government consump-
tion or investment are directly refl  ected as 
elements of GDP . By contrast, additional 
funds for households, for example in the 
form of transfer payments or income tax 
breaks, boost disposable income. Their dir-
ect impact on demand will be to the same 
extent that households use the funds for 
additional expenditure, although part of 
these funds might be channelled into sav-
ings, for example. The macroeconomic im-
pact of investment incentives for enterprises 
will depend on the extent to which the in-
centives are actually taken up and lead to 
additional investments.
Given the fact that the design of the meas-
ures is still undecided, the simplifying as-
sumption was made that the respective 
funds from the energy and climate fund 
would be available to enterprises, house-
holds and the government in equal parts. 
The simulation assumes that the enterprises 
fully draw upon and invest the funds made 
available to them. The second third is used 
to raise government consumption; house-
13 The assumed development in fund revenues is 
based on the Federal Government’s expectations as 
outlined in the draft Fuel Emissions Trading Act (Brenn-
stoffemissionshandelsgesetz). It assumes the new car-
bon pricing will generate revenues of €3.6 billion for 
2021 and €6.9 billion for 2022. The expected relevant 
CO₂ emissions can be determined using the corres-
ponding CO₂ price for the respective year as a basis 
(see table on p. 31). Accordingly, this CO₂ emission of 
360 million tonnes in 2021 will be around 4% lower by 
2022.Estimated impact of climate action on

to remain higher than those in the other euro 
area countries until the end of the projection 
horizon. Compared with the projection from 
June of this year, a weaker increase in con -
sumer prices is anticipated for 2020 above all 
(see the table on p. 17). In view of the down -
ward revision of the projections for wages and 
the output gap, the core rate, in particular, is 
likely to be somewhat lower throughout. The 
dampening effect on headline inflation will be 
further amplified in 2020 by the lower energy 
prices assumed in the projection. By contrast, 
the rise in energy prices in the following year is 
expected to almost entirely offset the slight 
downward revision of the core rate.
Public finances
The general government surplus is likely to be 
scaled back gradually in the coming years. 
Starting at 1½% of GDP this year (2018: +1.9% of GDP), it is set to be virtually fully depleted by 
2021, according to the projection. The budget 
will then remain more or less balanced in 2022. 
Fiscal policy loosening is the chief factor behind 
this decline. In addition, the positive cyclical ef -
fect on public finances will wane. As a result, 
revenue from taxes and social contributions, 
above all, will experience a temporary slow -
down in growth. However, lower interest ex -
penditure and reduced spending on bank sup -
port measures will ease the pressure on public 
finances.15 Economic growth will be markedly 
bolstered by the loosening of fiscal policy, par -
ticularly in the next two years.
The driving factor behind fiscal loosening is 
broad- based dynamic expenditure growth. 
Considerable growth in spending on pensions, 
healthcare and long- term care is likely. In add -

fer payments. This is broadly consistent 
overall with the approach which was also 
incorporated into the macroeconomic pro-
jections.14 Households’ consumer spending 
and housing investment fi  nanced out of 
additional disposable income stimulate ag-
gregate demand, as do business investment 
and government consumption. In line with 
their respective import shares, they increase 
imports from abroad. Through higher 
wages, amongst other factors, the in-
creased aggregate capacity utilisation raises 
the prices of domestically produced goods 
and thus dampens price competitiveness. 
Exports therefore decline slightly below 
their baseline level.
Overall, government expenditure measures 
counteract the dampening effect of carbon 
pricing. If the total impact on GDP growth 
is cumulated over the years in question, the negative effect on economic output is 
largely offset. As fi  scal policy measures, fi  rst 
and foremost, stimulate aggregate de-
mand, they are likely to have additional in-
fl  ationary effects. These will have a some-
what lagged impact, however, and accord-
ing to the simulation results will therefore 
still be limited in the period under review. 
Given the assumptions made here, the esti-
mated effects on the HICP , in a macroeco-
nomic context, will be somewhat higher 
overall than the mechanical estimation of 
the direct effects of CO₂ mark-ups on en-
ergy prices suggests.
14 The impact of the tax incentives is not taken into 
account in the simulation but is included in the projec-
tion.
15 In the current year, payments for Norddeutsche Landes -
bank (Nord/ LB) have been weighing on public finances. Be 
that as it may, the funds for this are lower than those spent 
on HSH Nordbank last year.Deutsche Bundesbank

ition, central, state and local governments plan 
to spend more on transport and digital infra -
structures, childcare and education, as well as 
internal and external security. Furthermore, 
additional expenditure on the promotion of 
measures to reduce CO₂ emissions is envisaged 
as of 2020. Interest expenditure, in particular, 
will decline due to savings created by the refi -
nancing of maturing bonds. In addition, the 
debt level will sink. Relative to GDP , govern -
ment spending excluding interest expenditure 
(primary expenditure) will reach its post-  
reunification peak at the end of the projection 
horizon.16
On the revenue side, the fiscal stance is broadly 
neutral. Although various cuts in taxes and 
other levies (particularly the partial abolition of 
the solidarity surcharge) will reduce revenue, 
this will be offset by additional revenue from 
increases elsewhere (including higher contribu -
tion rates to the health insurance institutions 
and sales of new CO₂ emission allowances) and from progressive taxation. As a result of 
robust economic developments on the domes -
tic front, the GDP growth structure will remain 
an abundant source of government revenue. 
Overall, revenue from taxes and social contri -
butions is again set to increase somewhat more 
strongly than GDP , according to the projection. 
The tax and social contributions ratio is thus 
comparatively high, albeit somewhat lower 
than its last peak at the turn of the millennium.
The debt ratio, i.e. government debt in relation 
to nominal GDP , is projected to continue de -
clining, falling below 60% by 2020 at the latest 
(2018: 61.9%).17 Central, state and local gov -
ernments’ primary surpluses will contribute to 
this. In addition, the average interest rate will 
remain clearly below nominal GDP growth, 
likewise pushing the debt ratio down. Further -
more, government- owned bad banks are ex -
pected to deleverage their portfolios further 
and to repay their debts.
Risk assessment
The macroeconomic projections presented 
here outline the most probable scenario for the 
German economy from today’s perspective. 
The calculations are based on various assump -
tions; actual future developments may vary. In -
dustry, which is particularly dependent on ex -
ports, is expected to stabilise before the down -
turn spills over to a greater extent to the more 
domestically oriented economic sectors, which 
have proved to be remarkably resilient thus far. 
This is of notable significance for the projection 
at the current juncture. However, risks from the

16 This will also apply to the cyclically adjusted primary ex -
penditure ratio. The figures were adjusted for the balance 
of notional capital transfers between the government and 
the corporate sector, particularly in connection with the 
dissolution of the Treuhand agency.
17 This year, however, the deleveraging process is likely to 
lag considerably behind the surpluses recorded by central, 
state and local governments and the running- down of bad 
banks’ portfolios. One reason for this is the observed rise in 
cash collateral for derivatives transactions made by bad 
banks and central, state and local governments. This in -
creases both financial assets and debts.Deutsche Bundesbank

global environment persist, which could ex -
acerbate or prolong the downturn in the indus -
trial sector. This would increase the likelihood 
of a broad- based transfer of risk to the econ -
omy as a whole. A situation could then arise in 
which economic output declines considerably 
for an extended period of time in many differ -
ent sectors of the economy, ultimately culmin -
ating in an underutilisation of aggregate cap -
acity. Although the danger of such an un -
favourable outcome is currently smaller than it 
was a few months ago, it has not yet been 
averted. Not least on account of this, the risks 
with regard to economic activity are tilted to 
the downside. This is less true with regard to 
consumer prices as momentum could turn out 
to be higher, particularly on the strength of po -
tential additional measures to combat climate 
change.
Risks from the global environment continue to 
emanate from the trade policy stance of the 
United States, in particular. Uncertainty sur -
rounding the future shape of global trade re -
mains high in spite of signs of easing tensions 
in the interim, and the risk of increasing protec -
tionism worldwide persists. Not only could this 
be a further drag on global trade, which is still 
flagging, it might also severely shake the confi -
dence of enterprises with global operations in 
the reliability and advantageousness of cross-  
border production processes. The German in -
dustrial sector, which plays an integral role in 
global value chains, could be hit particularly 
hard by this. There would also be negative con -
sequences for Germany’s export business in the 
event of the United Kingdom leaving the Euro -
pean Union in a disorderly process, which still 
cannot be ruled out, or an economic slump in 
China. However, the present projection makes 
conservative assumptions with regard to the 
outlook for global trade, meaning that more 
favourable developments could well be pos -
sible, too. Should global investment activity re -
bound more quickly than projected, for ex -
ample, additional demand stimulus may result 
in a swifter recovery for German exports and 
thus lead to greater economic growth.Risks to eco -

The balance of risks with regard to the ex -
pected inflation rate appears to be slightly 
tilted to the downside. Looking at the assumed 
future crude oil prices, similarly significant risks 
can be identified on both sides in each case. 
On the one hand, OPEC and its partners have 
decided to cut back production somewhat fur -
ther than expected, resulting in a slight price 
increase.18 In future, production losses stem -
ming from geopolitical tensions could also re -
sult in increased crude oil prices. On the other 
hand, however, the approved cuts may not be 
fully implemented, and non-  OPEC countries 
might expand their own production more strongly. One upside risk to the inflation rate is 
that the price of CO₂ allowances in Germany 
will be raised more sharply. For example, the 
prices set thus far may be deemed insufficient 
for Germany to reach its outlined emission tar -
gets. Higher tariffs or other protectionist meas -
ures could also temporarily put additional pres -
sure on consumer prices. By contrast, the infla -
tion rate would be lower if the demand for 
goods should prove to be weaker than ex -
pected on account of these factors.Overall risk

German enterprises’ profitability and 
 financing in 2018
Given the less dynamic economic environment in 2018, the profitability of non- financial corpor -
ations remained markedly below the high level of 2017. However, sales continued to expand at 
an above average rate despite the weak export performance and the somewhat less dynamic 
private consumption in comparison to the previous year, likely due to price effects as well. In sec -
toral terms, growth in sales was driven primarily by commodity- intensive and domestically ori -
ented sectors. In the more export- based sectors, the increase in sales was much smaller. On the 
cost side, enterprises were confronted with additional pension provisions, higher purchase prices 
for intermediate goods and raw materials, and robust wage growth. The overall result of this was 
a marked decline in German enterprises’ average pre- tax return on sales.
The equity ratio of non- financial corporations, which had risen sharply since the end of the 1990s, 
has now settled at a high level. Given the German corporate sector’s now low level of debt by 
international standards, this indicates growing saturation tendencies in enterprises’ equity bases. 
Moreover, the increases in pension provisions, which have become necessary since the low inter -
est rate environment set in, continue to narrow firms’ scope for increasing their equity ratio. In the 
reporting year, the rise in post- employment benefit obligations was linked to the further reduction 
in the discount rate and a weaker performance of the assets held for settlement. More recent 
statistical data on the life expectancy of current and former employees was likewise a factor  .
Enterprises’ scope for internal financing, which had broadened strongly in recent years, remained 
largely unchanged in 2018. A higher level of provisioning as well as slightly higher write- downs 
reduced the scope for profit retention. Firms continued to draw on borrowed funds on a large 
scale, although they did not exceed 2017’s high level. The increase in liabilities to banks persisted, 
however. In the reporting year, the significant expansion in cash – especially in the automotive 
industry – on the assets side was notable. Net tangible fixed assets rose fairly sharply in line with 
the very dynamic business investment up to that point. It is also worth noting that, in purely arith -
metical terms, gross capital formation was not financed entirely by funds generated internally for 
the first time since 2012.
Given the distinct economic slowdown, non- financial corporations are likely to increase their 
business activity only moderately during the current year. The ongoing need for adjustment to 
pension provisions owing to interest rates and the continuing rise in personnel expenses are likely 
to put downward pressure on the profitability of enterprises’ activity as well.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
The boom in the German economy continued 
in 2018, though not at the same pace as in 
2017. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 
by 1.5%. Economic growth in the reporting 
year thus largely paralleled the expansion in 
potential output. Aggregate capacity utilisation 
remained unchanged on balance and con -
tinued to exceed its longer- term average con -
siderably. The main reason for the cyclical slow -
down was the headwinds coming from the 
global setting, which was compounded by 
supply- side problems in the automotive indus -
try.1 Exports therefore saw only muted growth. 
Private consumption lost some steam com -
pared to the previous year despite the ongoing 
favourable labour market developments. On 
the other hand, very dynamic business invest -
ment and rising housing construction invest -
ment still emitted strong demand impulses. 
There were additional burdens on the cost side 
owing to the necessary increase in provisions 
for pension obligations given the further de -
cline in discount rates. Likewise, significantly 
higher prices had to be paid for industrial raw 
materials and intermediate goods. Moreover, 
the persistently high level of tension on the la -
bour market caused sharp wage growth.
Overall, enterprises’ pre- tax return on sales in 
the reporting year declined from the high val -
ues of the previous two years, dropping to 
4.2%.2 However, this was still higher than dur -
ing the period from 2011 to 2015. The sharp 
decrease in the discount rate for pension provi -
sions is likely to have played a major role here. 
Furthermore, the slower pace of economic ac -
tivity, the associated weaker growth in the sales 
markets and the elevated cost pressure coming 
from input factors also squeezed profit margins 
and reduced enterprises’ profitability. The de -
clining annual results in certain economic sec -
tors was also attributable to sector-  specific 
causes. For example, decreases in investment 
income in the chemical and pharmaceutical in -
dustry pushed down the gross return on sales, 
whilst energy and water suppliers no longer had the preceding year’s extraordinary income 
from the nuclear fuel tax refund. Car manufac -
turers’ temporary production losses had less of 
an impact on the income statements of the 
automotive industry than might have been ex -
pected, however. Although supply-  side prob -
lems reduced sales growth in the automotive 
industry, the decline in the return on vehicle 
manufacture was mitigated by a clear rise in 
investment income, as had been seen in previ -
ous crisis years.
In 2018, the discount rate for the valuation of 
provisions for post- employment benefit obliga -
tions applicable according to the German Com -
mercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) fell by just 
under 0.5 percentage point compared with the 
end of the previous year on account of the ten- 
year smoothing mechanism.3 This was the larg -
est decrease in the discount rate since 2015, 
after which new legislation extended the refer -
ence period for calculating the average dis -
count rate from seven to ten years. The need to 
adjust the reported pension provisions also de -
pends on the performance of the assets held 
for settlement purposes. Whilst in previous 
years enterprises benefited from appreciation 
in the value of plan assets, assets held for 
settlement purposes evidently underperformed 
in terms of value over the reporting year. This 
made additional provisions necessary. Another 
albeit quantitatively less significant factor is 
likely to have been the application of new mor -
tality tables, which take into account the higher 
average life expectancy of current and former 
employees in the statistical data. All in all, the 
necessary pension provisions and the corres -
ponding interest and personnel expenses 
– both of which strain profitability – were up 
significantly.Less favourable

The number of corporate insolvencies fell once 
again in 2018, reaching the lowest level since 
the most recent Bankruptcy Act was passed in 
1999. Enterprises’ sound capital base as well as 
the favourable funding and debt restructuring 
conditions are likely to have been a factor in 
this regard. The manufacturing sector, which 
was particularly affected by the cyclical slow -
down, also saw a further considerable decline 
in the number of insolvent firms. However, the 
pace of the overall decrease in corporate in -
solvencies slowed slightly in 2018. In some sec -
tors, such as construction, accommodation 
and food service activities, and information and 
communications services, there was a marginal 
rise in the frequency of insolvencies.
Sales and income
Sales growth among non- financial corporations 
was strong in 2018 at just over 5%, albeit 
somewhat below the preceding year’s increase. 
As before, the increases in sales revenues are 
likely to have been attributable to volume and 
price effects in more or less equal measure, as 
prices for goods and services rose roughly half 
as much as sales. For example, the prices of in -
dustrial goods on the domestic market went up 
by 2.6% and therefore at a similar rate as in the 
preceding year, and prices for goods exports 
were 1.2% higher than in 2017. Interest income 
remained weak in light of the persistent low 
interest rate environment. By contrast, the 
trend increase in investment income continued. 
One- off effects in the automotive industry, 
where there was a rise in the dividends of sub -
sidiaries, played an important role in this con -
text. Other operating income was at a low 
level, too.4

overall and this was reflected in sales growth 
across all sectors of the economy. Sales grew 
particularly strongly in the energy sector. This 
was due, on the one hand, to higher world 
market prices for energy and, on the other 
hand, to the fact that individual large enter -
prises distinctly increased their electricity trad -
ing activities. The above average growth in 
sales in the construction sector is likely to be 
attributable to flourishing construction activity 
bolstered by relatively good weather conditions 
towards the end of the year. By contrast, the 
automotive industry recorded sales growth of 
around 1% in 2018, the weakest growth since 
the crisis year of 2009. This was partly due to 
supply- side difficulties following implementa -
tion of a new emissions test – the Worldwide 
Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure 
(WLTP).
At just under 6%, non- financial corporations’ 
total expenses experienced steeper growth in 
the reporting year than total income. This was 
largely driven by another considerable increase 
in the cost of materials on the back of rising 
commodity prices. Accordingly, the construc -
tion sector and energy companies, in particular, 
recorded high levels of expenditure growth. In 
light of the ongoing low interest rate environ -
ment, the interest-  related increase in pension 
provisions continued to push up both person -
nel and interest expenses significantly (+5¾% 
and +25%, respectively). Just under half of the 
increase in interest expenses was recorded by 
manufacturers of transport equipment. How -
ever, the increase in personnel expenses was 
also driven by substantial wage increases and 
the high level of employment growth in the re -
porting year. Other expenses – the third largest 
expenditure item – were back to reporting dis -
tinct growth levels (4½%) after a number of 
years marked by one- off effects as a result of 
the Accounting Directive Implementation Act.5Sales growth

Sources and uses of funds
Enterprises’ sources and uses of funds fell 
slightly in 2018. The fall in the sources of funds 
was spurred by a moderate decline in external 
funds while internal funds remained almost 
constant. External funds, in turn, declined fol -
lowing a reduced build- up of long- term obliga -
tions in comparison with the previous year. 
Turning to the uses of funds, there was a clear 
decline in financial asset formation compared 
with the previous year, when investment had 
been characterised by an exceptionally high 
level of acquisition of other long- term equity 
investments and related claims. In the reporting year, non- financial asset formation rose to a 
new record level.6 In addition, beyond replace -
ment purchases, new investment surpassed all 
levels recorded since the start of the survey. On Sources and

6 The calculation of the net increase in tangible fixed assets 
in the extrapolated results of the corporate financial state -
ments statistics has been aligned with the Federal Statistical 
Office’s investment survey. Goodwill is no longer included 
under investment in intangible fixed assets, but under the 
acquisition of other long- term equity investments. Conse -
quently, goodwill is no longer part of the intangible assets 
recorded under non- financial assets, but is included in 
other long-  term equity investments recorded under finan -
cial assets. In order to ensure consistency over time, this 
amendment has also been made for all previous years up 
to and including 1997.Deutsche Bundesbank

Balance sheet developments
German enterprises’ total assets increased in 
2018 in line with continued buoyant sales 
growth; however, while the pace was still high, 
it was somewhat slower than in 2017. On the 
assets side, the share of financial assets in total 
assets remained broadly unchanged. Receiva -
bles from affiliated companies rose steeply – 
particularly the long-  term ones. This reflects 
the growing interconnectedness of enterprises. As in the previous year, manufacturers of trans -
port equipment posted the highest value for 
the acquisition of other long- term equity in -
vestments. The electrical engineering industry 
and the chemical and pharmaceutical sector 
also increased their holdings of other long- term 
equity investments distinctly. Trade credits rose 
dynamically, keeping pace with sales growth. 
Cash was also up significantly, boosted primar -
ily by the automotive sector covering its in -
creased liquidity needs using surpluses from 
operating activities and intra- group borrowing 
from financing subsidiaries.Total assets and

Non- financial assets increased significantly in 
2018 and even by a little more than in the pre -
vious year. Nevertheless, the share of tangible 
fixed assets in total assets continued to fall. A 
number of sectors –  including chemical and 
pharmaceutical, manufacture of machinery and 
equipment, construction and trade (excluding 
motor vehicles) – accumulated tangible fixed 
assets at an above average rate. Furthermore, 
non- financial corporations continued to invest 
heavily in intangible fixed assets. The chemical 
and pharmaceutical industry, in particular, 
upped purchases of patents and distribution 
rights, but manufacturers of transport equip -
ment and wholesale retailers also increased their holdings of intangible fixed assets signifi -
cantly. Once again, enterprises stocked up their 
inventories substantially. As in 2017, the major -
ity of the inventories were held in roughly equal 
parts by the construction sector and the manu -
facturing sector as a whole. Inventories were 
distributed relatively broadly across the individ -
ual industrial sectors. However, there is no sign 
of extraordinarily strong stockpiling in the over -
all balance sheet for the automotive sector, 
which would have been plausible given supply 
delays as a result of the WLTP .

The evolution of German enterprises’ equity ratio
The rise in non- fi  nancial corporations’ sav-
ings played a major role in driving Germa-
ny’s current account surplus to today’s high 
level.1 One consequence of fi  rms retaining a 
large share of their earnings over the years 
was the steady improvement in their equity 
base.2 According to extrapolated results 
from the corporate fi  nancial statement stat-
istics, the aggregate equity ratio of non- 
fi  nancial enterprises in Germany – defi  ned 
as equity as a percentage of total assets – 
increased from around 20% in 1997 to 31% 
in 2018.
Compared with the equity ratios of other 
countries of the European Union, which are 
based on data provided by the Bank for the 
Accounts of Companies Harmonized 
(BACH), German non- fi  nancial corporations 
had a relatively small median equity base at the start of the last decade.3 Since then, the 
equity base has tended to become stronger 
in many countries, with this rise in equity 
being higher than average in Germany. At 
last count, German enterprises’ equity ratio 
was at the higher end for the group of 
countries under analysis.4
Disaggregated data in the Bundesbank’s 
corporate balance sheet statistics suggest 
that growth in the equity ratio was a wide-
spread development across Germany’s cor-
porate sector. However, signifi  cant dispar-
ities in terms of the size of the increase can 
be seen when breaking fi  rms down by size 
and legal form. For example, the strength-
ening of small and medium- sized enter-
prises’ equity base was particularly pro-
nounced, albeit starting from a low level in 
the 1990s. By contrast, the increase was 
signifi  cantly lower for large enterprises. Fur-
thermore, the equity ratio rose sharply for 
corporations, in particular – although they 
started from a higher level than non- 
corporations. On the other hand, an exam-
ination of the manufacturing and services 
sectors as a whole revealed no noteworthy 
differences in terms of the level of the 
equity ratio or the magnitude of its in-
crease.

the aggregate equity ratio in BACH, the trend increase 
for Germany is weaker compared with the median.

also sheds more light on the evolution of 
the corporate saving ratio and Germany’s 
current account balance. In view of the 
relatively high debt ratio across Germany’s 
corporate sector in the 1990s, there is a 
strong case for interpreting the increase in 
the equity ratio as an attempt on the part of 
enterprises to deleverage. Since the end of 
the 1990s, debt fi  nancing has probably be-
come less attractive to enterprises in Ger-
many on account of developments such as 
the corporate tax reform of 2000 and 2001 
as well as stricter banking regulation. These 
changes are likely to have prompted fi  rms 
which were highly leveraged at that time, in 
particular, to strengthen their equity base.5 
To test this hypothesis, fi  rm- specifi  c data 
from German corporate balance sheets are 
used to compare relatively highly leveraged 
enterprises with enterprises with lower le-
verage ratios in order to explore how their 
respective equity ratios have evolved since 
1998 relative to the pre-1998 period.6 If the 
equity ratios diverge more strongly as of 
1998, this approach would suggest that it is 
the result of the role played by leverage. 
The econometric results support this theory, 
since the equity ratio of fi  rms with initially 
relatively low equity ratios and high short- 
term liabilities rose particularly sharply.7
One factor that may have slightly damp-
ened the increase in the equity ratio, par-
ticularly since the current period of low 
interest rates began, is the increase in ne-
cessary pension provisions. Pursuant to the 
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch), pension provisions must equal the 
present value of expected payments dis-
counted using an interest rate which, since 
2010, has been calculated as the moving 
average of the market interest rates of the 
past years.8 Firms that had made a commit-
ment to pay current and former employees 
an occupational pension under defi  ned 
benefi  t pension plans were forced to raise their pension provisions due to the decline 
in interest rates. Taken by itself, this nar-
rowed fi  rms’ scope to expand their equity 
ratio. In order to quantify the signifi  cance of 
this effect, the evolution of the equity ratio Equity ratios of non-financial

6 The year 1998 is roughly the point at which enter-
prises’ equity ratios started to rise. Balanced samples 
of fi  rms were taken for the 1994-2001 period based 
on a difference- in- differences approach. The fi  rm- 
specifi  c equity ratio was regressed on a dummy vari-
able with a value of 1 for the period as of 1998 as well 
as on an interaction term composed of this dummy 
variable and the mean of the data for selected fi  rm 
characteristics in the pre-1998 period. The estimation 
equation also includes fi  xed effects at the fi  rm level.
7 Additional placebo estimations suggest that this ef-
fect goes beyond the mean reversion of leverage ratios 
documented in the literature (Lemmon, Roberts and 
Zender, 2008).
8 Upon the introduction of the Accounting Law Mod-
ernisation Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz) 
with effect from 1 January 2010, the applicable dis-
count rate for an average residual maturity of 15 years 
was 5.25%. The period on which the calculation of the 
average discount rate is based was extended in 2016 
from seven to ten years for fi  nancial years after 2015. 
For information on the potential effects of changing 
the reference period in 2016, see also Deutsche Bun-
desbank (2016).Deutsche Bundesbank

of enterprises with and without pension 
provisions was compared over consecutive 
years as part of the regressions, with steps 
being taken to ensure the statistical com-
parability of the two groups of enterprises.9 
The results suggest that the sharp decrease 
in the discount rate in the period from 2013 
onwards had a statistically signifi  cant ad-
verse effect on enterprises’ equity ratios. 
Enterprises with pension provisions in-
creased their equity ratio during this period 
by around 0.5 to 1 percentage point less 
than enterprises without pension provi-
sions.10
Changes on the assets side of German en-
terprises’ balance sheets can also give clues 
as to which other factors contributed to the 
higher equity ratio. According to additional 
econometric estimations, the rise in the 
equity ratio between 1997 and 2016 was 
connected to an increase in the shares of 
tangible fi  xed assets, other long- term equity investments and cash relative to total 
assets.11 Growth in cash holdings was par-
ticularly pronounced for the more weakly 
capitalised small and medium- sized enter-
prises. This suggests that precautionary mo-
tives could have played a role in this group.12 
Based on empirical estimations, however, 
there is no evidence to support the hypoth-
esis that the growing share of intangible 
assets contributed to the increase in the 
equity ratio.13
In summary, it can be concluded that delev-
eraging, in particular, has a statistically sig-
nifi  cant and quantitatively important effect 
on the increase in the equity ratio. Never-
theless, further investigation is needed in 
order to better distinguish between the ef-
fects of changes in the structural environ-
ment, such as corporate taxation or bank-
ing regulation, which brought about fi  rms’ 
deleveraging. In view of the meanwhile 
comparatively low level of debt in the Ger-
man non- fi  nancial corporate sector by 
international standards, the decline in cor-
porate savings since 2015 as well as the 
currently more subdued level of profi  tability, 
it is unlikely that enterprises will sizeably in-
crease their equity ratio in the years ahead.
9 The estimation model is based on a difference- in- 
differences approach with a synthetic control group, 
which ensures the same average values for both 
groups of enterprises in the four- year period prior to 
the year under analysis with regard to the equity ratio.
10 Extending the reference period for calculating the 
average discount rate from seven to ten years in 2016 
appears to have afforded enterprises some temporary 
relief, as there is no discernible additional increase in 
the estimated effect between 2015 and 2016. Empiric-
ally, there is no evidence that changes made in the 
context of the Accounting Law Modernisation Act in 
2010 had a negative impact on enterprises’ equity 
ratios.
11 The results are based on a regression of the changes 
in the shares of various assets relative to total assets on 
changes in the equity ratio, which statistically con-
trolled for the effects of unobserved variables at the 
fi  rm level.

medium- sized enterprises continued to top up 
their equity base during the reporting year (for 
more information on the longer- term develop -
ment of the equity ratio of enterprises in Ger -
many, see the box on pp. 44 ff.). By contrast, 
large enterprises’ equity ratio declined some -
what.7 This is likely due, in part, to additional 
provisions for pensions, as direct commitments 
predominantly affect large enterprises.8
In absolute terms, liabilities and provisions re -
corded significant growth, as did equity. Liabil -
ities to affiliated companies and trade payables 
rose considerably. As in the previous year, liabil -
ities to banks – in particular those with a short 
maturity – increased clearly, probably as bridge 
financing for the acquisition of other long- term 
equity investments. The marked growth in pay -
ments received on account of orders was again 
largely attributable to the construction sector 
and is in line with the high level of inventories 
in this sector. During the reporting year, bor -
rowing by issuing bonds slipped from the high 
level recorded in the past few years and was 
weak overall due to the decline in issues of 
long- term bonds.
Trends for 2019
With the economy continuing to slow, 2019 is 
likely to see only a moderate increase in non-  
financial corporations’ business activities. The 
broad stagnation in world trade will probably 
have a visible impact on enterprises’ export 
business. However, those enterprises with ac -
tivities focused more on the domestic market 
may be able to benefit from robust demand 
from household consumers and the fact that 
housing construction is still expanding rapidly. 
The return on sales of enterprises is expected 
to feel the squeeze of interest rate adjustments 
for pension provisions as well as a further rise 
in personnel expenses. On the basis of the data 
for the first 11 months of the current year, the 
discount rate for post- employment benefit ob -
ligations is expected to be cut by around 
0.5 percentage point in 2019 from the previous year’s level. High wage settlements overall to 
date, the return to full joint financing of the 
statutory health insurance scheme and an in -
crease in payroll employment will push up per -Equity ratio

7 In the extrapolated results of the corporate financial 
statements statistics, dividends earmarked for distribution 
are now shown under equity rather than other liabilities in 
line with enterprises’ accounting practice. In the Bundes -
bank’s corporate financial statements statistics, a consist -
ent backcasting has been performed for all previous years 
up to and including 1997. Including the entire surplus for 
the year under equity increases this item in mathematical 
terms.

Profi  tability and fi  nancial position of listed groups in 2018 
and an outlook for 2019
Weaker global economic growth in 2018 
also dampened the performance of Ger-
man listed non- fi  nancial groups.1 The return 
on sales,2 which had been above average in 
recent years, was somewhat lower in 2018. 
Adjusted for changes in the consolidation 
groups, it fell by 0.6 percentage point to 
7.6% last year.3 The decline was sharper in 
the production sector than in the services 
sector. This was mainly due to the signifi  -cant decrease in operating income with 
only a slight increase in revenues.
Around 60% of those groups that had re-
ported an increase in revenues in 2017 re-
corded lower revenue growth in the report-
ing year.4 A key factor here was the global 
economic slowdown. Furthermore, enter-
prise groups in the automotive sector 
posted weaker sales and those in the chem-
ical industry reported delivery problems. Ex-
change rate effects relating to the consoli-
dation of foreign subsidiaries also damp-
ened revenues.5 In addition, the fi  rst- time 
application of new accounting standards 
had an impact on the fi  nancial statements 
of the enterprise groups.6
1 According to the global reporting principle enshrined 
in both commercial law and the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), consolidated fi  nancial 
statements are the product of the consolidated single- 
entity accounts of all global subsidiaries included in the 
consolidated fi  nancial statements. The reporting popu-
lation comprises approximately 230 non- fi  nancial en-
terprise groups listed in Germany in the Prime Stand-
ard segment of the Frankfurt stock exchange.
2 Defi  ned here as the ratio of operating income (EBIT) 
to revenues.
3 The rates of change for return on sales, revenues, 
EBITDA and EBIT are published with reporting and con-
solidation basis adjustments (see Quality report on 
consolidated fi  nancial statements statistics). The fi  g-
ures in the charts are unadjusted so that the size differ-
entials between the items are also visible. For meth-
odological reasons, there may therefore be differences 
between the rates of change and the path shown in 
the charts.
4 Groups with changes of a quantitatively signifi  cant 
nature to the basis of consolidation were not included 
in this calculation. The groups included in the calcula-
tion account for 80% of aggregate revenues.
5 After converting the revenues of foreign subsidiaries 
into euro, the appreciation of the euro negatively af-
fected earnings growth in 2018. The nominal effective 
exchange rate of the euro against the currencies of the 
38 most important trading partners of the euro area 
(EER-38) rose by an annual average of 5.2% in 2018.
6 This involved the application of the new rules laid 
down in International Financial Reporting Standard

The operating income posted by the groups 
fell short of the previous year’s level. Oper-
ating income before depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) went down by just 
under 1% in 2018. This was attributable in 
large part to enterprise groups from the 
production sector. According to their an-
nual reports, their margins were squeezed 
by higher costs for commodities and inter-
mediate goods. In addition, motor vehicle 
manufacturers recorded higher retrofi  tting 
and legal costs in connection with the emis-
sions scandal and the introduction of a new 
emissions testing procedure. This was com-
pounded by the rise in transport costs as a 
result of the low water levels in the River 
Rhine as well as the fact that the previous 
year’s result was positively infl  uenced by 
one- off factors (reimbursement of nuclear 
fuel tax in the energy sector).
The deterioration in market conditions for 
products from the production sector7 and 
the early application of changes to account-
ing standards for leasing at one service 
group resulted in a large volume of depreci-
ation.8 This lowered operating income 
(EBIT) after depreciation and amortisation 
by just over 6% compared to the very high 
fi  gure recorded the previous year.
The value of long- term tangible assets re-
ported in the balance sheet rose by 1½% 
on aggregate, refl  ecting opposing effects. 
In the services sector, long- term tangible 
assets grew by 16% owing to the one- off 
effect caused by leasing contracts, whereas 
in the production sector, long- term tangible 
assets decreased by 2½%. The increase of 
just over 8% in inventories corresponded 
with the slump in sales in the automotive 
sector, among other things. Alongside a 
4½% rise in trade receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents also increased consider-
ably on the year, mainly owing to higher li-
quidity created by the issuance of bonds.On the liabilities side, debt fi  nancing rose 
more sharply than equity, raising the groups’ 
leverage ratio slightly. This was due in part 
to the issuance of bonds, particularly in the 
automotive and telecommunications sec-
tors, totalling €60 billion. Since the bonds 
were mainly issued by the groups’ German 
and international fi  nancing subsidiaries, no 
corresponding increase can be seen in the 
bonds issued by non- fi  nancial corporations 
7 Intangible assets were amortised as a consequence 
of the poor market conditions.
8 This relates to the voluntary early application of the 
new IFRS 16 governing the accounting treatment of 
operating leases. From the 2019 reporting year, leased 
assets not previously included in the balance sheet 
(“off- balance sheet leases”) and the corresponding 
lease liabilities must be included in the consolidated 
accounts. Because the new standard means that leases 
are recognised as assets, lease expenses are replaced 
by the interest expense and depreciation charge for 
the newly recognised lease asset. All in all, the new 
accounting practice will have an impact on various 
assets and liabilities belonging to the balance sheet 
and on the profi  t and loss statement.Equity ratios of German non-financial

in the issues statistics on debt securities in 
2018.
In addition, the one- off effect created by 
the change in the accounting treatment of 
leasing led to a marked increase in debt in 
the services sector. By contrast, on the 
whole, pension provisions showed no sig-
nifi  cant changes on the year since there 
was barely any difference in the end- of- 
period interest rates used to calculate the 
present value of the liabilities.9 On balance, 
the equity ratio fell by around 1 percentage 
point to 30½%, refl  ecting the underlying 
developments across all sectors of the 
economy.
Groups’ profi  tability showed a further clear 
decline in the fi  rst three quarters of 2019, 
with performance in individual sectors de-
teriorating considerably in the light of the 
continued economic slowdown and persist-
ent structural challenges. In 2019, profi  ts 
before taxes on income will probably fall far 
short of last year’s level owing to a rise in 
expenses. In view of the slight increase in 
revenues, the gross return on sales is likely 
to decrease markedly in 2019.The widespread application of the new ac-
counting standard for leases will probably 
see a sharp rise in long- term tangible assets, 
liabilities and depreciation. Besides this, the 
data for the fi  rst three quarters suggest that 
debt levels may increase further as a result 
of the new issuance of bonds in the capital 
markets. Pension provisions are also ex-
pected to go up because the reference 
interest rate used to calculate the present 
values is likely to fall. On balance, this will 
probably have a negative impact on groups’ 
equity ratio.

The relevance of surveys of expectations 
for the Deutsche Bundesbank
The expectations of economic agents strongly influence their decisions and actions. Depending 
on their assessment of future developments, firms may either increase or decrease their invest -
ment and households may increase or decrease their saving and consumption. For the Bundes -
bank, expectations are relevant for two particular reasons. First, expectations influence prices 
both directly and indirectly via consumption and investment, and stable prices are the primary 
objective of the Bundesbank and the Eurosystem. Second, expectations play a key role in deci -
sions on risky, often credit- financed purchases – such as real estate purchases – and thus affect 
financial stability, which the Bundesbank also has a mandate to safeguard.
Given the relevance of expectations, the Bundesbank launched a pilot study in the second quarter 
of 2019 to identify the expectations of households in Germany by means of an online monthly 
survey and to gain initial insights into the potential of expectations data, which have not been 
available for Germany up to now. A total of more than 4,000 individuals were surveyed on their 
expectations, particularly regarding inflation, interest rates, consumption, rents and real estate 
prices. Three findings warrant particular attention.
First, the inflation expectations of individuals in Germany are relatively well- anchored. A signifi -
cant majority of the respondents expect inflation rates to range between 0% and 3% over the 
next 12 months, with the median in all three survey waves standing at exactly 2%. Second, the 
individuals’ uncertainty about inflation expectations contains information about future changes 
in the individuals’ inflation expectations, and is thus useful for monetary policy and inflation fore -
casting. Third, the price rises for real estate expected by individuals over the next 12 months are 
of roughly the same size, on average, as the price increases seen last year; renters tend to expect 
a stronger hike than homeowners. The disaggregated data reveal significantly different trends, 
however, which are worthy of more thorough analysis.
After evaluating the pilot study, the Bundesbank decided to regularly survey individuals in Ger -
many on their perceptions and expectations at monthly intervals. The results will be made avail -
able to the public promptly. The Bundesbank is thus helping to enhance the volume of informa -
tion on economic expectations in Germany and is expanding the pool of data it needs to fulfil its 
mandates.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Expectations about future economic develop -
ments play a key role in all economic decisions 
– from purchases of seasonal goods, with their 
strong price fluctuations, to acquisitions of dur -
able consumer goods, right down to billion-  
euro investment decisions of multinational 
firms. Yet the expectations of households and 
firms influence not just their own decisions, but 
also macroeconomic developments. If all 
agents are expecting prices to increase strongly, 
many of them will bring forward planned pur -
chases as long as those prices have not yet 
risen too sharply. This increased demand will 
usually lead to rising prices – the expectations 
are self- fulfilling in this scenario.
Expectations also carry weight for the Bundes -
bank in each of its five core business areas – 
monetary policy, financial stability, banking 
supervision, payments and cash management.
Expectations of movements in interest rates 
and real estate prices affect the willingness to 
buy a property or take out a real estate loan. 
These expectations thus have an impact on the 
stability of the financial system generally, and 
potentially also on the stability of individual 
banks. And expectations have an effect on 
price developments and influence the effective -
ness of monetary policy measures. It is no sur -
prise, then, that central banks have recently 
shown greater interest in gaining a more pre -
cise understanding of how households form 
expectations.1 Another reason for this is that 
central banks, like those of the Eurosystem, are 
ascribing increasing importance to their 
forward- looking communication, known as 
forward guidance.2
Given that measures of expectations are such 
an important input for monetary policy, data 
on household expectations in Germany are sur -
prisingly scarce.3 This shortcoming prompted 
the Bundesbank to recently launch a pilot study 
for a comprehensive household survey on ex -
pectations, in order to explore the potential of such data for its own ongoing work as well as 
for basic research. The Bundesbank Online Pilot 
Survey on Consumer Expectations in Germany 
was carried out between April and June 2019 
in three consecutive survey waves (the survey 
concept is outlined in the box on pp. 55f.). It 
covered various main topics. Insights of par -
ticular interest for monetary policy are the level 
of the expected inflation rate, its distribution 
across individuals, the evolution of the inflation 
expectation over time, and the uncertainty that 
each person surveyed individually ascribes to 
inflation developments. Other points of interest 
are the differences between the expectations 
of households and those of professional mar -
ket players, the determinants of expectation 
formation, and the relationships between 
households’ inflation expectations and their 
patterns of consumption and saving. The ques -
tions of particular relevance to financial stability 
relate to household expectations about the de -
velopment of rents, real estate prices and inter -
est rates, as well as the inputs into these ex -
pectations. These data can provide indications 
of imminent abrupt price corrections and hence 
of risk stemming from real estate loans.
This article outlines the methodology and se -
lected results of the pilot survey. While con -
sidering issues of data quality, it assesses the 
relevance of the results achieved in view of the 
academic research and taking particular ac -
count of the Bundesbank’s tasks, before con -
cluding with an outlook for the Bundesbank’s 
intended use of expectations data.Role and

Survey concept of the Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey 
on Consumer Expectations in Germany
In the Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey on 
Consumer Expectations, approximately 
2,000 individuals were surveyed via the 
internet in each of three successive waves, 
resulting in more than 6,000 responses. A 
portion of the respondents were surveyed 
multiple times, meaning that 4,000 re-
spondents were included in the survey. 
Conducting the survey online ensures short 
fi  eld periods, quick data processing and 
thus a high survey frequency. However, 
population coverage and sampling present 
certain challenges, particularly in contrast 
to personal (face- to- face) interviews. The 
target population of the survey was individ-
uals aged 16 and older living in Germany 
with internet access. The survey was con-
ducted by forsa using its online panel, 
which is recruited entirely offl   ine (forsa.
omninet). Respondents are recruited by 
telephone during a forsa.omniTel survey, 
which is based on a representative sample 
of the German- speaking population aged 
14 and older. The advantage of offl   ine re-
cruitment via telephone is that the online 
survey then also includes individuals who 
do not spend a signifi  cant amount of time 
on the internet and, in contrast to panels 
recruited online excludes individuals who 
only participate in (online) surveys for fi  nan-
cial incentives. This allows distortionary ef-
fects in the form of a selection bias to be 
reduced to a good degree and a represen-
tative sample of the German online popula-
tion to be obtained. The table on p. 56 pro-
vides an overview of the methodological 
framework of the Bundesbank pilot survey.
The questionnaires of the Bundesbank pilot 
survey consist of a set of core questions and 
varying question modules that were pro-
posed by the Bundesbank as well as internal 
and external researchers. These question-
naires focus on surveying expectations and 
corresponding control variables in order to 
gain insights into the expectation formation 
process.1The questions regarding consumer expect-
ations are detailed and take into account a 
number of measurements as well as the ex-
periences and recommendations from other 
studies. Questions on infl  ation expectations 
are asked in qualitative form (direction of 
infl  ation changes), quantitative form (point 
estimate of infl  ation expectations) and 
probabilistic form (evaluation of likelihoods 
of infl  ation being within specifi  c ranges). 
The same applies to the questions on the 
expected development of real estate prices. 
Expectations regarding rents and interest 
rate developments, including rates on mort-
gages and savings accounts, are analysed in 
qualitative and quantitative form. A purely 
qualitative approach is taken to surveying 
expectations regarding general economic 
developments, particularly unemployment.
Distortion of survey results due to refusals 
and break- offs –  known as non- response 
bias – can to some extent be corrected by 
means of weighting. The Bundesbank sur-
vey contains only limited information on 
the individuals who refuse to participate in 
the survey. However, by comparing the 
demographic characteristics of the respond-
ents with those of the target population, 
weights can be constructed for each sur-
veyed individual. For this survey, the weights 
were chosen in such a way that the mar-
ginal distributions of age, gender, educa-
tion and region correspond to the data of 
the forsa.omniTel omnibus survey represen-
tative of the German (online) population 
aged 14 and older.2

Insights for monetary  
policy and central bank 
 communication
More than 60% of surveyed individuals in Ger -
many expect inflation to increase over the next 
12 months in all three of the survey months 
from April to June 2019. Asked about the level 
of inflation over the next 12 months, the ma -
jority of individuals said they anticipated an in -
flation rate between 0% and 3% (see the 
above chart). Only a few individuals expect very 
high inflation or sharply negative inflation rates, 
in other words high deflation. The median, i.e. 
the value that splits respondents into two 
equally sized groups with high and low infla -
tion expectations respectively, is exactly 2% in 
all three waves.
A comparison with the predictions of profes -
sional forecasters, whose forecasts ranged be -
tween 1.2% and 2.5% in the period of the sur -
vey,4 makes it clear that the majority of those 
surveyed in the Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey 
have largely comparable expectations. And the 
Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey also delivers 
comparable and very plausible results com -
pared to other household surveys (see the box 
on pp. 58 f.).Previous research has established that past ex -
periences influence inflation expectations,5 and 
the analysis based on the Bundesbank Online 
Pilot Survey supports and adds to these find -
ings. A case in point are the expectations of 
individuals who lived in East Germany prior to 
reunification. They expect a higher inflation 
rate than people who lived in West Germany 
before reunification. They are also more likely 
to expect inflation to increase. This difference 
can be related to the experience of a sudden 
rise of inflation in East Germany right after re -
unification.6
Other patterns in the Bundesbank Online Pilot 
Survey data also confirm insights from previous 
research. An analysis of various sociodemo -
graphic groups shows that men are less likely 
to expect inflation to rise, and generally expect 
inflation to be lower than women do. Individ -
uals with a higher level of education, home -
owners and people in full- time employment 
also tend to have relatively lower inflation ex -
pectations.The majority of

A comparison of the results of the Bundesbank Online Pilot 
Survey with existing surveys
Some of the statistics that are used to de-
scribe the expectations of households and 
individuals are based on mean or average 
values. These are highly sensitive to distor-
tions from unusual responses – a phenom-
enon known as outliers. This proves prob-
lematic, especially in those questions where 
respondents are asked to provide a point 
estimate of how they expect infl  ation or 
prices in the residential real estate market 
to develop. Such questions are known to 
elicit extreme values from a low number of 
respondents. In the literature, it is thus 
common practice to remove extreme out-
liers before analysing expectations. For in-
fl  ation expectations, only those observa-
tions occurring in the interval of -12% and 
+12% are usually analysed.1 This box com-
pares the results of the Bundesbank Online 
Pilot Survey, particularly the percentage of outliers, with the results from other surveys 
on household expectations – notably the 
New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expect-
ations, on the one hand, and the consumer 
survey on behalf of the European Commis-
sion, on the other hand, which is conducted 
in Germany by the market research institu-
tion GfK.2
If infl  ation expectations of below -12% and 
above +12% are deemed outliers, the per-
centage occurring in the Bundesbank On-
line Pilot Survey (4.8%) is lower than in

It is also interesting that individuals with higher 
income tend to expect lower inflation rates (see 
the chart on p. 60). This effect could be related 
to differences in experienced inflation: different 
consumption bundles could mean that low-  
income households experience higher inflation 
than high- income households.7
Not only the level of inflation expectations but 
also disagreement about expected inflation 
matter for monetary policy. The degree of dis -
agreement and how it develops over time may 
have an important impact on monetary policy 
transmission, as a current study shows.8 As an 
example, the upper chart on p. 61 shows the 
average expected inflation rate by income 
group (above or below the median) in the 
upper panel, and disagreement about expected 
inflation rates9 in the lower panel. Not only do 
individuals with an income above the median 
exhibit lower inflation expectations than people 
with lower income, their predictions of future 
inflation are also more similar to each other.Inflation expectations and 
 individual uncertainty
Another important aspect of inflation expect -
ations is individual uncertainty about the level 
of expected inflation. In this context, the ques -
tion arises as to whether higher uncertainty 
about future inflation is associated with a will -
ingness to revise subjective inflation expect -
ations. In order to assess the question of how 
certain individuals are about their inflation ex -
pectations and to what degree individuals who 
are especially uncertain revise their expectations Higher individ -
ual uncertainty 
about future 
inflation associ -
ated with 
greater revisions 
of expectationsboth the US survey and that conducted by 
GfK (see the adjacent table).
The chart on p. 58 illustrates the distribu-
tion of responses in the fi  rst wave of the 
Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey (fi  eldwork 
in April 2019) compared to the responses in 
the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Ex-
pectations (fi  eldwork in April 2018). Given 
that both surveys followed a period of low 
and stable infl  ation rates and that infl  ation 
rates within those periods were very similar 
in Germany and in the US, it is noticeable 
that the Bundesbank data for German 
households are much more tightly distrib-
uted with fl  atter upper and lower tails.3
However, due to the low level of outliers, it 
is currently not possible to fi  nd reliable ex-
planations for outlier values based on socio- 
demographic characteristics. 3 Observations with responses expecting infl  ation 
rates of below -12% and above +20% are not in-
cluded.Infl  ation expectation outliers –

over time, the Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey 
includes a question on the subjective probability 
distribution of the expected inflation rate.10
People who expect higher inflation rates as 
well as those who expect negative inflation 
rates tend to be more uncertain about their in -
flation forecasts (see the bottom chart on 
p. 61).11
In the pilot survey, the differences in subjective 
uncertainty levels and in the levels of expected 
inflation have significant effects on people’s 
adjustments of their expectations. Using the 
panel dimension of the dataset, we find that 
individuals with higher uncertainty about fu -
ture inflation rates are significantly more likely 
to revise their inflation forecast from one 
month to the next. People who expect moder -
ate inflation (in a range between 0% and 3%) 
tend, on average, to adjust their expectations 
slightly downwards, and those who expect 
negative inflation also tend to revise their ex -
pectations downwards; individuals who expect 
higher inflation rates, meanwhile, tend to 
change their expectations strongly upwards.
Central banks usually prefer inflation expect -
ations to remain as stable as possible at around 
the monetary policy target rate of inflation be -
cause as long as this is the case, changes to the policy rate set by the central bank are passed 
through directly to the real interest rate that ap -
plies to investment and consumption. Abrupt 
changes in individual inflation expectations 
could signal a de- anchoring of inflation from 
the monetary policy target rate, which would 
hinder monetary policy transmission and which 
the central bank would try to counteract by 
means of communication.12 Data from the Bun -
desbank Online Pilot Survey were used to make 
two major findings in this regard. First, Coibion, 
D’Acunto, Gorodnichenko and Weber show 
that additional information can reduce individ -
ual uncertainty about inflation expectations. 
Second, Conrad and Glas show that people 
who do not predominantly use classic media 
channels such as newspapers and television or 
radio news to access information about monet -
ary policy tend to be particularly uncertain (see 
the chart on p. 64).13 This second finding sup -

lar results for firms’ expectations.

Haan and Sturm (2019); Binder (2017).

cate more via social media, in addition to other 
channels. Further research findings were pre -
sented at a conference on household expect -
ations organised jointly by the Bundesbank and 
the Banque de France (see the box on p. 62 f.).
Given the importance of firmly anchored infla -
tion expectations for monetary policy, central 
banks could use prompt, high- quality time ser -
ies on inflation expectations and the uncer -
tainty surrounding them as a valuable source of 
information.
Inflation expectations and 
 intended consumption and 
saving
Another key aspect for central banks is the re -
lationship between inflation expectations and 
intended saving and consumption. In theory, 
households with higher inflation expectations 
ought to display a lower propensity to save be -
cause –  all other things being equal  – these 
households are expecting real interest rates to 
generate lower returns on savings. An analysis 
of the survey results does indeed show that in -
dividuals who are expecting inflation to rise are 
significantly more likely to save less than other 
people. Furthermore, people who expect a 
higher rate of inflation are more likely to plan 
to increase their spending on durable con -
sumer goods over the next 12 months in com -
parison to the previous year. And for individuals 
who expect interest rates to go down, the 
planned saving rate drops – which is also in 
keeping with the theory.
These results corroborate earlier studies based, 
amongst others, on the Bundesbank’s Panel on 
household finances (PHF) study.14 What they 
mainly suggest, though, is that the general 
public do understand basic economic concepts 
and incorporate their expectations into their 
consumption and saving behaviour.
In conclusion, the Bundesbank Online Pilot Sur -
vey demonstrates that household inflation ex -pectations in Germany are mostly moderate, 
with more than two- thirds of respondents ex -
pecting inflation to fall within a range of 0% to 
3%. Significant discrepancies do exist, how -People expect -

Insights from the Bundesbank and Banque de France Joint 
Conference on Household Expectations
At the conference held from 26 to 28 Sep-
tember this year on the topic of household 
expectations, researchers shared fi  ndings 
which could be of signifi  cance for monetary 
policy, fi  nancial stability policy and the com-
munications strategy of the Bundesbank. 
Amongst other sources, scientifi  c fi  ndings 
from the Bundesbank’s Online Pilot Survey 
on Consumer Expectations in Germany 
were presented. A selection of the  insights 
from the conference is outlined below.1
Insights on monetary policy
The reason for monetary policy’s keen focus 
on infl  ation expectations is that, in an envir-
onment of virtually fi  xed short- term nom-
inal interest rates, they are the only remain-
ing way to infl  uence real interest rates.2 In-
fl  ation expectations have an effect on 
household consumption, fi  rms’ investment 
and pricing behaviour and workers’ wage 
demands. When seeking to ascertain causal 
relationships between infl  ation expectations 
and behaviour, researchers are increasingly 
employing randomised controlled trials, 
whereby only some of the study partici-
pants receive certain pieces of information. 
This makes it possible to investigate how 
that information affects expectation forma-
tion and actions.3
Bottone and Rosolia (2019) fi  nd that in Italy 
fi  rms adjust their infl  ation expectations on 
the basis of monetary policy decisions. With 
regard to the behaviour of fi  rms when infl  a-
tion expectations are higher, Coibion, 
Gorodnichenko and Kumar (2018) fi  nd, on 
the basis of data for New Zealand, increases 
in employment and investment and no 
change in prices and wages. Coibion, 
Gorodnichenko and Ropele (2018), how-ever, identify declines in employment and 
investment plus increases in prices based on 
data for Italy.4
Households in Germany do not behave in 
line with Neo- Fisherian theory, that is to 
say, they do not expect that an interest rate 
rise would lead to a higher infl  ation rate. 
This is the fi  nding of Bachmann, Born, Sims 
and Weber, based on questions posed as 
part of the Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey. 
Nor, for the most part, are any Neo- 
Fisherites to be found in sub- groups of the 
survey respondents; rather, the established 
theory according to which interest rate rises 
bring about decreases in infl  ation is borne 
out in the survey data.5
Insights on fi  nancial stability
Renters expect signifi  cantly stronger in-
creases in house prices than homeowners, 
since they form their expectations based on 
different sources of information. This is the 
fi  nding of Kindermann, Le Blanc, Piazzesi 
and Schneider from analyses of Bundes-
bank data (PHF study and Online Pilot Sur-
vey) as well as from a model with learning 
agents. Their research found that individual 
house price expectations can largely be ex-

2 For economic decisions, the relevant interest rate is 
the perceived real interest rate: rt = it – Et (πt+1). If 
the nominal interest rate it is fi  xed, infl  ation expect-
ations Et (πt+1) determine – according to the Fisher 
equation – the real interest rate.

plained by housing status (renter or owner) 
and by previous house price growth in the 
respondent’s region.6
Household expectations infl  uence purchas-
ing behaviour and can help to explain house 
price cycles. Drawing on data from the Bun-
desbank Online Pilot Survey, Abbassi and 
Beutel investigate the role expectations and 
in particular heterogeneities in expectations 
play in the development of house prices 
and rents. Ludwig, Mankart, Quintana, 
Vellekoop and Wiederholt examine similar 
questions using data from De Nederland-
sche Bank, and also add data from the Bun-
desbank Online Pilot Survey.7
Households become accustomed to house 
price increases and extrapolate previous 
house price increases into future expect-
ations. In doing so, they underestimate the 
persistence in the longer term, meaning 
they underestimate the characteristic of 
house prices reverting to an average rate of 
growth. This is the fi  nding of Gosselin, Khan 
and Verstraete (2019) on the basis of a rep-
resentative household survey in Canada; 
they observe that excessive real estate price 
expectations can lead to very strong boom- 
bust cycles in house prices. Combined with 
real estate loans, this can give rise to fi  nan-
cial stability risk.8
Insights on central bank communication
Simple central bank messages impact 
strongly on household expectations. The 
more extensive the messages are, the 
blunter their effect becomes. This is the 
fi  nding of several studies based on data 
from the United States. Respondents who 
were provided with simple messages – the 
latest realised infl  ation rate, the central 
bank’s infl  ation target or infl  ation forecast – 
subsequently adjusted their infl  ation ex-
pectation signifi  cantly towards more plaus-ible values. Other respondents were pre-
sented with the latest FOMC statement or a 
press article on the most recent monetary 
policy decision as “information treatment”. 
The response to the press article was the 
weakest compared with the other informa-
tion listed here. However, the adjustment of 
infl  ation expectations is only short- lived. 
Signifi  cant effects are no longer recognis-
able after six months. The same fi  nding is 
made in a laboratory experiment in which 
multiple respondents form their expect-
ations based on certain central bank infor-
mation, resulting in actual values in the la-
boratory for interest rates, income and in-
fl  ation – in this experiment, simple central 
bank information stabilises interest rate ex-
pectations most effectively.9
Individuals in Germany primarily use classic 
media to obtain information on monetary 
policy. The older, the more educated and 
the wealthier people are, the more this 
holds true. People who use classic media 
(radio, television, newspapers or their web-
sites) have signifi  cantly lower infl  ation ex-
pectations, lower forecast errors and lower 
uncertainty regarding future infl  ation.10

ever, between the different population groups 
in terms of inflation expectations, disagree -
ment over inflation expectations and individual 
uncertainty about inflation expectations. Col -
lecting and analysing these measures promises 
to deliver valuable insights for the Bundesbank.  
Insights for financial stability
Real estate is usually the most valuable asset a 
household owns and, for most households, 
real estate ownership requires taking on sub -
stantial debt. Consequently, purchasing a 
house or flat is a major decision for many 
households. Expectations of how rents and pri -
vate residential real estate prices will develop 
play a key role in households’ decisions to buy, 
and thus have an impact on actual property 
prices.15 Property prices have risen sharply 
across much of Germany in recent years. The 
Bundesbank is keeping a close eye on this, not 
least in light of the lessons learned from real 
estate price developments in the United States 
at the time of the financial crisis in 2007. Many 
studies find evidence to suggest that excessive 
expectations surrounding future rent and price 
developments were one of the root causes of 
the US residential real estate market boom and 
the subsequent real estate crisis in the 2000s.16Data on households’ expectations of price de -
velopments in the residential real estate market 
allow differences between expectations and 
actual price developments to be identified. The 
Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey therefore con -
tains several questions about the real estate 
market and, thanks to its good regional cover -
age, allows such gaps to be identified for indi -
vidual Federal states or even districts.17 Overall, 
the Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey covered re -
spondents from 398 of the 401 districts in Ger -
many. The geographical coverage is particularly 
important because the significant increase in 
prices in the market for private residential real 
estate is no longer confined to urban areas, but 
is spilling over to districts far away from metro -
politan areas.18
Expectations about the future 
growth of real estate prices
As in the case of inflation expectations, the 
Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey works with dif -
ferent types of questions to also examine ex -
pectations about real estate prices. All types of 
questions concern the expected development 
of real estate prices over the next 12 months in 
the region of the respective respondent. In the 
first question, survey participants are asked to 
state their expectations about real estate prices 
on a five- point scale ranging from “decrease 
significantly” to “increase significantly” (see the 
table on p. 65). Based on this question, around 
80% of all respondents in each of the three 
survey waves expect prices to increase. Around 
35% expect even expect real estate prices to 
increase significantly, whereas fewer than 1% In the household 
sector, real 
estate is the

expect prices to decrease. Strong regional dif -
ferences were found in expectations about 
how prices in the market for real estate will de -
velop going forward. The chart on p. 66 shows 
the percentage of respondents at the Federal 
state level who expect prices to increase signifi -
cantly.19 This percentage is lowest in Saarland, 
Saxony-  Anhalt and Thuringia, at around only 
20%.20 The values for Bavaria (43%), Branden -
burg (45%) and Hamburg (47%) are signifi -
cantly higher. In Berlin, as many as 58% of re -
spondents expect real estate prices to increase 
significantly. A similar picture emerges when 
the expectations about the future development 
of real estate prices are aggregated on the 
basis of the characteristics of the individual dis -
tricts. The table on p. 66 shows that more indi -
viduals in urban districts expect real estate 
prices to increase significantly than in rural dis -
tricts.21 This is consistent with the different 
price trends observed in recent years. Real es -
tate prices in urban districts have risen more 
strongly in the last few years than in rural dis -
tricts, with the strongest price increases re -
corded for major cities.22 However, driving this 
pattern, the settlement structure plays a less 
important role than demographic and eco -
nomic developments in the respective districts. 
Irrespective of whether they live in urban or 
rural districts, the percentage of respondents 
expecting a significant price increase is consid -
erably higher in growing than in non- growing 
districts.23
In addition, more renters than homeowners ex -
pect a significant price increase.24 Making a dis -
tinction between renters and homeowners is 
key to understanding the regional differences 
in real estate price expectations. As a rule, the 
share of renters in urban districts is greater 
than in rural districts.25 Thus, part of the higher 
house price expectations in cities is attributable 
to the greater share of renter households there, 
who, on average, have higher home price ex -
pectations than homeowners.Distribution of real estate price 
expectations
It is reasonable to assume, that when forming 
real estate price expectations, individuals take 
their bearings at least partly from past price de -

20 Generally speaking, the percentage shares are low for 
Federal states with a low population density. For data on 
population densities in Federal states, see Federal Statistical 
Office (2018).
21 The classification of districts is based on the “district 
type” indicator devised by the Federal Institute for Research 
on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development. Dis -
tricts categorised as “urban district” and “district- free major 
city” were classified as urban districts and all other districts 
as rural districts; see Federal Institute for Research on Build -
ing, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development (2019a).

23 The classification of districts is based on the indicator 
“Growing and shrinking of districts/ district regions” devised 
by the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Af -
fairs and Spatial Development and on different demo -
graphic and economic indicators; see Federal Institute for 
Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Develop -
ment (2018). Districts classified as “growing” or “growing 
at an above- average rate” were classified as growing dis -
tricts, and all other districts as non- growing districts.

whether real estate price expectations corres -
pond with or overshoot past developments. 
For this reason, individuals participating in the 
Bundesbank Online Pilot Survey were also 
asked by what percentage they expect prices 
for real estate to rise or fall.According to the responses to this question, in -
dividuals on a nationwide average expect prices 
to increase by 5.9% over the next 12 months. 
The median is of a similar magnitude, standing 
at 5%.26 These values are largely in line with 
past price developments in the real estate mar -
ket.27 According to the house price index of the 
Federal Statistical Office, residential real estate 
prices likewise increased by 5.9% between Oc -
tober 2018 and September 2019. Individuals 
therefore expect, on average, prices to rise at 
the same rate as previous price increases.28
The chart on p. 67 shows the distribution of 
expectations regarding real estate price growth 
measured in percent. Although just under 25% 
of respondents expect prices to rise by 5%, the 
chart reveals a strong dispersion in the re -
sponses.29 Given the large differences in past 
price developments in the German market for 
private residential real estate, this dispersion is 
not surprising. The chart also shows that 89% 
of all responses fall within the range of price 
increases seen in Germany over the last five 
years; around 10% of all responses are above 
this range.
While individuals, on average, expect price 
growth to be in line with previous price in -

prevent outliers from distorting the median, values on or

of the variable rises from 5.9% to 6.5%. The weighted 
median  remains at 5%.

obtained when the respondents are asked to state the 
price development they expect, not as a percentage but as 
a change in euro amounts, as shown in Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2019b), pp. 47-48.
29 The high share of respondents expecting an increase in 
real estate prices of 0% is due to the design of the online 
questionnaire. Respondents who, in response to the first 
question about real estate prices, stated they expect prices 
to stay roughly the same were not asked to express in per -
centage points their expectations about the future growth 
of real estate prices. Instead, the value of 0% was entered 
subsequently for these respondents.Deutsche Bundesbank

level of individual districts. The chart on p. 68 
shows a comparison of expected and past real 
estate price developments. For the purposes of 
this comparison, all respondents were first of 
all ordered by how prices evolved over the last 
five years in the district of their primary resi -
dence. The blue line shows these past price de -
velopments, while the black line plots the real 
estate price growth expected by respondents. 
It is clear from this chart that individuals draw 
on past price developments when forming 
their expectations of future real estate prices. 
However, the chart also illustrates a significant 
divergence in expectations at the regional level: 
those respondents living in districts where price 
increases were high in the past tend to expect 
price increases to fall behind their previous 
levels. At the same time, those respondents 
who live in districts where price increases were 
low in the past tend to expect price increases 
to outstrip their previous levels. Only time will 
tell how far this finding should be regarded as 
a warning sign for excessive price expectations 
in regions that tend to be structurally weaker, 
or more as a sign of a regional equalisation of 
real estate price developments.
Looking at all these findings on financial stabil -
ity in their entirety, real estate price develop -
ments and real estate price expectations can be 
seen to vary significantly depending on the re -gion observed and household group surveyed. 
This insight is not new. In the global financial 
crisis, too, it was a subgroup of households 
and a subgroup of real estate that served as a 
catalyst for the crisis. Since then, policymakers 
and academics have been showing a greater 
interest in households’ real estate decisions and 
their impact on financial stability. Their focus of 
interest lies, in particular, on factors that influ -
ence the formation of expectations surround -
ing price developments in the real estate mar -
ket and on indicators that can be used to as -
sess the risk of abrupt changes in the real es -
tate market. The Bundesbank Online Pilot 
Survey provides initial evidence on both counts.
Outlook
At a time in which inflation expectations and 
central bank communication are playing an 
ever more prominent role and in which devel -
opments in the real estate market can become 
risks to financial stability, the Bundesbank is 
working to improve the volume of information 
underpinning its recommendations in these 
areas. By implementing the pilot survey on 
household expectations in Germany, the Bun -
desbank has taken a first step towards filling a 
data gap for Germany. In so doing, it is contrib -
uting to the analysis of household expectations Divergence in

and the related decisions on consumption, sav -
ing and investment.
With regard to inflation expectations, the re -
sults of the Online Pilot Survey show that con -
sumers in Germany have relatively realistic ex -
pectations that, for a large portion of respond -
ents, do not deviate sharply from the expect -
ations of professional market players. That said, 
expectations do differ significantly across indi -
vidual households. In particular, depending on 
income group, very different values come to 
light for individual uncertainty and the degree 
of agreement on inflation expectations. Individ -
uals with higher incomes are less uncertain 
with regard to their expectations, and there is 
greater alignment in the inflation expectations 
of people in this income group. For lower in -
come households, by contrast, individual un -
certainty with regard to inflation expectations is greater, as are the differences between the 
individual inflation expectations in this group. 
These differences can have substantial conse -
quences for the functioning and effectiveness 
of monetary policy measures. First, it is shown 
that individuals who are very uncertain with re -
gard to their inflation expectations are more 
likely to revise their inflation expectations 
within a short period of time. Second, as aca -
demic research has shown that uncertainty and 
disagreement surrounding inflation expect -
ations play an important role in monetary pol -
icy transmission,30 the Bundesbank will act on 
these insights and collect data on how expect -
ations and uncertainty regarding inflation 
evolve on a monthly basis.
In a similar manner, it has also been shown that 
data on individuals’ expectations provide valu -
able information on current developments in 
the real estate market. In particular, data on in -
dividuals’ expectations of rents and house 
prices allow granular, regional or household-  
group- specific analyses to be carried out. These 
are one factor in the early identification of pos -
sible credit- driven developments in the real es -
tate market and thus of risks to financial stabil -
ity. It is precisely this type of analysis that was 
found to be crucially needed following the fi -
nancial crisis of 2007, and by rolling out the 
pilot survey on household expectations in Ger -
many, the Bundesbank has started filling in one 
of the existing data gaps.
After evaluating the results from the pilot sur -
vey, the Bundesbank has decided to continue 
the monthly, internet- based survey of individ -
uals in Germany. It will pool its expertise on ex -
pectations surveys in a Bundesbank Expect -
ations Centre and make its services available to 
not only the research community but also the 
general public from 2021 onwards.Bundesbank

The mixing of euro coins in Germany
Euro coins have a common European side and a national side. As a result of coins being taken 
abroad by travellers or transported by professional cash handlers, euro coins migrate between 
the euro area countries. This mixing of national coin holdings with coins of other countries of 
origin is a reflection of the free movement of people and capital in the euro area.
The responsibility for minting euro coins lies with the individual euro area countries, which means 
they have a direct claim on the resulting coin revenue. As a consequence, the migration of euro 
coins has implications not only for national coin requirement planning, but also for the distribu -
tion of coin revenue between the countries of the euro area. If more euro coins flow out of one 
euro area country to other parts of the euro area than vice versa, that euro area country will have 
higher minting requirements and greater coin revenue. Against this background, this article exam -
ines the mixing of coin stocks in Germany and discusses the possible impact of coin migration on 
German coin issuance.
Every year, the Bundesbank ascertains the composition of coins in domestic circulation with 
regard to the various national sides using samples of around 60,000 coins each of €2, €1, 50 
cent, and 20 cent coins. On this basis, insights can be obtained regarding the extent of coin flows 
between Germany and the rest of the euro area. Model- based analyses suggest that roughly 
equal numbers of €2, €1, 50 cent, and 20 cent coins have flowed from Germany to other euro 
area countries as in the opposite direction, although this finding is based on estimates and is 
therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2019

Background
In the euro area, coin issuance remains a na -
tional matter, though it is coordinated at the 
European level.1 These conditions are also re -
flected in the design of the euro coins, which 
feature a common European side and a na -
tional side.2 As a result of coins being taken 
abroad by travellers, amongst other reasons, 
coin stocks in the euro area have become 
mixed and consist of euro coins with various 
national sides.
The migration of euro coins is of interest due to 
its potential implications for coin requirement 
planning and the distribution of coin revenue 
between the euro area countries.3 The euro 
area member states are responsible for minting 
national coins and accordingly have a direct 
claim on the resulting coin revenue.4 The mint -
ing of national coins is, in turn, determined by 
the need for coins among private cash users. If 
more coins flow out of one euro area country 
into other parts of the euro area than vice 
versa, that country will have to authorise the 
minting of greater volumes of coins than a 
country with net inflows of euro coins, but will 
also be entitled to a larger proportion of the 
coin revenue. Against this background, this art -
icle examines the mixing of coin stocks in Ger -
many and discusses the possible impact of coin 
migration on German coin issuance.
Mixing of coin stocks  
in Germany
Each year, the Bundesbank uses coin samples 
to ascertain the composition of coins in circula -
tion with regard to the various national sides. 
These samples are taken from coin lodgements 
at Bundesbank branches and are therefore de -
rived from the coins in active circulation in Ger -
many.5 The upper table on p. 75 presents the 
current findings for 2019. According to these 
findings, 57.5% of €2 coins, 45.2% of €1 coins, 
54.1% of 50 cent coins, and 62.4% of 20 cent 
coins featured a German national side. Euro coins from the large euro area countries of 
France, Italy and Spain naturally appear more 
frequently in Germany than euro coins from 
smaller euro member states. In addition, euro 
coins from the neighbouring countries of Bel -
gium, the Netherlands and Austria, with which 
Germany is closely connected via travel, are 
widespread.
The origin of foreign euro coins in Germany is 
analysed in greater detail using linear regres -
sions based on the random samples taken at 
the start of 2019.6 In this analysis, a given euro 
area country’s share of the foreign coin stocks 
in active circulation in Germany is explained 
using that euro area country’s share of cumula -
tive net coin issuance7 in the euro area exclud -
ing Germany as well as a variable for measur -

scribed in greater detail in Deutsche Bundesbank (2013a).

can be found in Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).
3 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2003); Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2013a); Seitz et al. (2009) and Seitz et al. (2012).
4 In Germany, the annual minting requirements are deter -
mined by the Federal Ministry of Finance on the basis of 
estimated needs calculated by the Bundesbank, see Federal 
Ministry of Finance (2016) and Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2013a). The Bundesbank purchases these coins from the 
Federal Government at their nominal value and introduces 
them into circulation on its behalf. The respective increases 
in the volume of coins in circulation in the euro area coun -
tries have to be approved by the European Central Bank. 
Credits from the central banks to the euro area countries 
for coin stocks held in central bank vaults are only permis -
sible if these coin stocks amount to no more than 10% of 
the national volume of coins in circulation.
5 The composition of coin stocks in Germany that have 
been permanently lost, collected or used as a store of value 
cannot be observed. The only observable aspect is the 
composition of coin stocks that are in active circulation 
among consumers, commercial enterprises and credit insti -
tutions and that are therefore able to return to the Bundes -
bank. This active circulation of coins comprises the transac -
tion balances of consumers, commercial enterprises and 
credit institutions.
6 These regressions expand upon studies found in Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013a).

difference between cumulative outpayments and cumula -
tive inpayments.Deutsche Bundesbank

travel with Germany.8 The results of the regres -
sions are shown in the lower table on this 
page. Coins from euro area countries with 
large volumes of coins in circulation as well as 
from countries with which Germany has close 
travel links are found more frequently in Ger -
many. For all of the observed denominations, 
the coefficient of determination R 2 is close to 
the theoretical maximum of 1, which means 
that this simple model explains virtually all of 
the variance in the individual shares of coins.
Reliable information on the composition of 
coins in active circulation in Germany is only 
available as of 2011 (see the chart on p. 76).9 
Germany’s share of coins has decreased further 
since 2011: from 66.2% to 57.5% for €2 coins, 
from 60.2% to 45.2% for €1 coins, from 67.3% 
to 54.1% for 50 cent coins, and from 69.2% to 
62.4% for 20 cent coins. However, the decline 
in the share of German coins in active circula -
tion in Germany appears to be slowing at the 
current end. For example, the year- on- year 
change in the German share of €2 coins 
amounted to -1.8 percentage points on aver -
age from 2012 to 2015 and -0.4 percentage 
point on average from 2016 to 2019. In the 
case of 50 cent coins, the German share fell by 
2.1 percentage points on average from 2012 to 
2015 and by 1.2 percentage points on average 
from 2016 to 2019. Using a model in which 
coins migrate between Germany and other 
euro area countries at fixed migration rates, the 
long- term development of coin shares can be 
predicted (see the box on pp. 78 ff.). The chart 
on p. 76 shows the coin shares derived from 
such a model in addition to the actual coin 
shares. According to the model calculations, 
the actual coin shares at the current end are 
close to limit values derived mathematically 
from the model. For example, the model calcu -
lates that, in the long term, 54% of the 50 cent 
coins in active circulation in Germany will fea -
ture a German national side, which is in line 
with the current measured share. These obser -Rates of change

euro area country for foreign travel with Germany is meas -
ured by the average of that country’s share of German 
travel expenditure and its share of German travel income. 
All goods and services that a traveller purchases from the 
countries visited for personal use or to take home for pri -
vate use are taken into account. Expenditure on inter -

vations suggest that coin stocks in the euro 
area have already become mixed to a signifi -
cant degree.
Euro coins in circulation
As a result of coin migration, coin stocks in the 
euro area consist of euro coins with various na -
tional sides. However, the absolute extent of 
coin flows between euro area countries and 
their importance for the development of na -
tional coin issuance are unknown. Conceptu -
ally, national cumulative net issuance comprises 
domestic and foreign circulation. Foreign circu -
lation is calculated based on the cumulative net 
outflows of coins.10 If a euro area country ex -
periences a greater outflow of coins abroad 
than inflows, then this euro area country ex -
hibits positive foreign circulation. Conversely, 
negative foreign circulation occurs when there 
is a net inflow of euro coins from abroad, caus -
ing the domestic demand for euro coins to be met in part by other coin- issuing authorities. 
Domestic circulation in a euro area country 
consists, in turn, of the euro coins held domes -
tically for transaction purposes as well as the 
hoarded euro coins. Coin hoards comprise 
coins that are saved or collected or that have 
been lost. These components of coin demand 
are not directly observable, but must, instead, 
be calculated based on models.
The upper chart on p. 77 shows the develop -
ment of euro coins in circulation issued by the 
euro area, Germany and the euro area exclud -
ing Germany. Overall, euro coins with a value 
of €29.7 billion are currently in circulation, of 
which €8.9 billion net was brought into circula -
tion by the Bundesbank (as at 31  October 
2019). It is estimated that the transaction bal -
ances of euro coins in Germany in 2011 
amounted to €2.3 billion, or 36% of the cumu -
lative net coin issuance in Germany at this point 
in time.11 According to this finding, the major -
ity of German coins in circulation are accounted 
for by hoarding and external demand. How -
ever, there are still no data on the relative im -
portance of domestic hoarding and outflows of 
coins abroad for the development of cumula -
tive net coin issuance.
By contrast, there is already strong evidence of 
a considerable outflow of euro banknotes from 
Germany to other countries.12 By way of illus -
tration, the lower chart on p.  77 shows the

ided into foreign circulation outside the euro area and for -
eign circulation within the euro area. In the box on 
pp. 78 f., the foreign circulation of German euro coins re -
fers to foreign circulation within the euro area. Foreign cir -
culation outside the euro area, if it exists, is notionally allo -
cated to domestic hoarding. Coin stocks abroad outside 
the euro area are, to a large extent, likely to be perman -
ently removed from active circulation in the euro area and 
are therefore comparable to domestic hoarding. In Euro -
pean Central Bank (2017), it is assumed that euro coin 
holdings outside the euro area are negligible.

tem. The relative contribution of the Bundes -
bank to euro banknote circulation grew fairly 
evenly from 35.9% at the end of 2002 to 56.1% 
at the end of 2018. The observed increase in 
the Bundesbank’s contribution to euro bank -
note circulation is likely to be caused by the 
migration of euro banknotes from Germany to 
other countries within and outside the euro 
area.13 If the domestic demand for cash de -
velops evenly across the various members of a 
monetary union and there are net cash flows 
from one member state to another, over time 
this will lead to a rising proportion of cash in 
circulation attributable to the former. The Ger -
man share of euro coins in circulation has, 
however, been rather stable at around 30% 
since the introduction of euro cash (see the 
lower chart on this page). Assuming that the 
domestic demand for coins in Germany de -
velops as it does in the euro area excluding 
Germany, this would suggest that, in net terms, 
no coins migrate from Germany to the euro 
area excluding Germany.
The information presented would thus be con -
sistent with coin inflows and outflows between 
Germany and the euro area excluding Germany 
being balanced. Coins being taken abroad by 
travellers is an important driver for the migra -
tion of coins between euro area countries (see 
the findings shown in the lower table on p. 75). 
When going on holiday from Germany to other 
euro area countries, travellers could bring a 
larger amount of euro banknotes with them on 
their outbound journey in order to be able to 
cover the expected travel expenditure abroad. 
On balance, this is likely to contribute to the 
observed net outflows of euro banknotes from 
Germany to other euro area countries. Euro 
coins are, however, hardly suited to covering 
major expenses on trips abroad. It is possible 
that the coin stocks held by travellers on both 
their outbound and inbound journeys simply 
result from being given change during the 
most recent cash transactions, suggesting that 
both stocks should be roughly equal. The find -
ing that coin inflows and outflows between Germany and the euro area excluding Germany 
are balanced would then be plausible.14
More detailed information on the extent of 
coin flows in the euro area requires model-  
based analyses. In principle, information is 
available on the shares of German and non-  
German euro coins in the coins in active circu -
lation in the euro area countries. However,

The coin mixture model
Euro coins in circulation can migrate not 
only from one region of the euro area to 
another, but also from active circulation to 
coin hoards. By assuming fi  xed transition 
rates among the coins in active circulation 
in the euro area countries and between 
active  domestic circulation and domestic 
hoarding, it is possible to model the coin 
mixture and the components of coin de-
mand.1
The model starts off by describing the mix-
ture of coins in active circulation in Ger-
many in year t, TD,t, and in the euro area 
excluding Germany, TA,t. Transaction bal-
ances in Germany comprise coins with a 
German side,TDD,t, and those with a non- 
German side, TAD,t. Coins in active circula-
tion in euro area countries other than Ger-
many consist of coins with a foreign na-
tional side, TAA,t, and those with a German 
national side, TDA,t. /u1D70FDD,t = TDD,t/TD,t stands 
for the share of German coins in the Ger-
man transaction balances, and  /u1D70FAA,t = TAA,t/
TA,t for the proportion of non- German euro 
coins among coins in active circulation in 
the other euro area countries. The transac-
tion balances in Germany and in the euro 
area excluding Germany are assumed to 
vary in size each year by the constant 
growth rates gD and gA, respectively. Coins 
can migrate from one region to another 
and from active circulation to hoards. αD 
denotes the share of coins fl  owing from the 
transaction balances in Germany each year 
to hoards in Germany, and αA the corres-
ponding share of coins in the euro area ex-
cluding Germany. αDA stands for the share 
of coins migrating each year from the trans-
action balances in Germany to active circu-
lation in the euro area excluding Germany, 
and αAD shows the corresponding share of coins fl  owing from other euro area coun-
tries to Germany.
In summary, the quantities of domestic 
coins in active domestic circulation can be 
presented as the following equations.
TDD,t = (1– αD–αDA)TDD,t-1+αADTDA,t-1+∆ND,t
TAA,t = (1– αA–αAD)TAA,t-1+αDATAD,t-1+∆NA,t
∆ND,t and ∆ NA,t denote the new issuance 
of coins, which is typically positive for Ger-
many and the euro area excluding Germany 
(see the chart at the top of p.  77). New 
issues of coins feature the national side of 
the issuer, and they result from the increase 
in transaction balances and from the need 
to replace coins which transition to hoards 
or fl  ow out of the country in net terms.2 
Rearranging the above equations yields the 
following difference equation for the evolu-
tion of coin shares, where /u1D702t-1 = TA,t-1/TD,t-1.

1 The coin mixture model based on this approach ori-
ginates from Seitz et al. (2009) and Seitz et al. (2012). 
The model presented in this box adds to this body of 
literature in a number of ways, one being the inclusion 
of the empirically important factor of hoarding.
2 In the following, the model is used to examine fl  ows 
of €2, €1 and 50 cent and 20 cent coins between Ger-
many and the euro area excluding Germany. For these 
coin denominations, there were no shipments be-
tween the Bundesbank and other coin- issuing author-
ities in the euro area. Hence, the national side can in-
deed be used to identify whether Germany or another 
euro area country was the country of fi  rst issue.Deutsche Bundesbank

The coin shares determined in this manner 
converge towards a fi  xed limit value.3 
Hoarding demand can be computed by cu-
mulating annual hoarding, and foreign de-
mand by cumulating annual net coin migra-
tion fl  ows.
By setting suitable model parameters, it is 
possible to identify model implications for 
the €2, €1, 50 cent and 20 cent coins. As-
sumptions need to be made in this regard 
about how transaction balances evolve in 
Germany and the euro area excluding Ger-
many. Euro area consumers receive euro 
coins as change and use them for low- value 
payments as well as alongside euro bank-
notes for larger amounts. This is a role 
which euro coins have performed ever since 
the euro was introduced as a physical cur-
rency. The low value of coin holdings is 
probably one reason why they are inde-
pendent of the variables which traditionally 
determine transaction balances, such as in-
come or interest rates.4 In light of these 
considerations, one could reasonably as-
sume that transaction balances of euro 
coins remain constant over time.5 Public 
surveys by the Bundesbank suggest that the 
average stock of coins which consumers in 
Germany carry on their person has re-
mained steady at around €6 ever since euro 
banknotes and coins were introduced, bol-
stering the assumption that transaction bal-
ances remain constant.6 Estimates regard-
ing transaction balances of euro banknotes 
in Germany are available as from the year 
2008; over the estimation period in ques-
tion, the transaction balances of euro bank-
notes have remained steady.7
Assuming the actively circulating stocks of 
coins evolve in this manner, it is possible to 
determine the other model parameters in a 
way that is model- consistent. As long as the 
hoarding and migration parameters are 
small, hoarding and migration within short horizons are negligible, which means that 
the transaction balances can be determined 
using the stock of coins in circulation at the 
end of 2002. Data for the coin shares in 
Germany and in the euro area excluding 
Germany are available for 2016.8 The model 
equations for the shares of domestic coins 
in circulation in Germany and in the euro 
area excluding Germany, and the equations 
computed for the evolution of cumulative 
net coin issuance, can be used to determine 
3 If ∆ND,t  > 0 and ∆NA,t > 0 for all t, it follows that gD =
gA. In this case, the convergence of coin shares /u1D70FDD,t 
and /u1D70FAA,t towards fi  xed coin shares /u1D70FDD and /u1D70FAA can be 
derived straight from the theory for solving linear dif-
ference equations (see Galor (2007)). The coin shares 
converge even when net issuance is not positive. If net 
issuance is negative, the difference equations need to 
be adjusted, since the coin- issuing authorities take in a 
mixture of coins.
4 See Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956).
5 Estimated foreign demand for German euro coins 
increases in line with the difference between the 
growth rate of transaction balances in the euro area 
excluding Germany and that of transaction balances in 
Germany. In an extreme scenario –  one where the 
transaction balances in the euro area excluding Ger-
many grow by 4% a year and those in Germany shrink 
by 4% a year – the volume of German €2 coins in cir-
culation outside Germany would come to 19% of the 
German €2 coins in circulation, so foreign demand 
would still be comparatively moderate, even in this 
scenario.
6 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2003, 2018a). The survey 
results reveal that, at year- end 2002, respondents car-
ried coins with a total value of €5.62 on average. By 
comparison, respondents were carrying coins on their 
person with an average value of €6.70 in 2008, €5.90 
in 2011, €5.73 in 2014 and €6.29 in 2017.

the hoarding and migration parameters.9 
The table on p. 79 provides a summary of 
the model parameters. For most denomin-
ations, the hoarding parameter in Germany, 
αD, is signifi  cantly higher than in the euro 
area excluding Germany, αA, suggesting 
that coin hoarding plays a more important 
role in Germany.
After determining the model parameters, it 
is possible to analyse the implications of the 
model. The estimates for foreign demand 
presented in the above table show the esti-
mated cumulative net coin fl  ows between 
Germany and the euro area excluding Ger-
many since euro banknotes and coins were 
introduced. According to the model calcu-
lations, net coin fl  ows were low for all the 
denominations under consideration. As-
suming that transaction balances do not 
contribute to the growth in the stock of 
coins in circulation, the model calculations 
can therefore be interpreted as suggesting 
that coin issuance since the introduction of 
euro banknotes and coins was materially 
driven by hoarding motives.
Coin shares converge in the mathematical 
model towards a fi  xed limit value, which can be calculated with the aid of the model 
parameters. The table below shows which 
coin shares can be expected over the long 
term for German coins in Germany accord-
ing to the model calculations. The actual 
values observed in the table at the top of 
p. 75 are close to these limit values.
9 The model’s implied values for the coin shares and 
cumulative net issuance in Germany and in the euro 
area excluding Germany are a function of the hoarding 
and migration parameters and ought to match the ac-
tual fi  gures. The resulting non- linear system of equa-
tions is solved using a multivariate Newton procedure; 
see Judd (1998).

servable, conclusions cannot readily be drawn 
about the extent of coin migration. The box on 
pp. 78 ff. describes a model used to ascertain 
the shares of coins in Germany and the euro 
area excluding Germany, as well as the extent 
of coin migration between these regions. 
Under certain assumptions, it is possible to de -
termine the parameters of this model and de -
rive model implications. Overall, according to 
the model- based analyses, up to the end of 
2016, 110 million more €2 coins, 172 million 
more €1 coins, 145 million more 50 cent coins 
and 390 million more 20 cent coins migrated 
from the rest of the euro area to Germany than 
vice versa. In aggregate terms, this amounts to 
a net migration to Germany of around €500 
million in euro coins, which is equivalent to 
7.6% of the German net coin issuance of these 
denominations. According to these calcula -
tions, coin flows between Germany and the 
euro area excluding Germany are thus almost 
entirely balanced.15 These model- based ana -
lyses are based on assumptions made during 
modelling and the establishment of the model 
parameters, which means they should be inter -
preted with caution.
In Germany, the Federal Ministry of Finance de -
fines the minting volumes for the individual de -
nominations on the basis of a forecast of the 
coins in circulation carried out by the Bundes -
bank.16 The above considerations suggest that 
coin outflows to other euro area countries are 
not currently a relevant factor in German coin 
issuance and thus German coin requirement 
planning.
Conclusion
This article examines the migration of euro 
coins between Germany and the other euro 
area countries and its impact on national coin issuance. The coin stocks in the euro area are 
mixed as a result of coins being taken abroad 
by travellers, for example. Around 40% of the 
€2 and 20 cent coins, around 55% of the €1 
coins and around 45% of the 50 cent coins in 
active circulation in Germany originate from 
abroad, meaning that foreign euro coins are 
widespread in Germany. Foreign coins in Ger -
many originate, above all, from France, Italy 
and Spain, as well as from the neighbouring 
countries of Belgium, the Netherlands and Aus -
tria.
The euro area countries are responsible for 
minting and issuing euro coins and have a dir -
ect claim on the resulting coin revenue. The ex -
tent of coin migration between the euro area 
countries is therefore relevant for coin require -
ment planning and assessing the distribution of 
coin revenue. The fact that the German share 
in the total volume of euro coins in circulation 
has remained stable at around 30% since the 
introduction of euro cash supports the hypoth -
esis of balanced coin flows between Germany 
and the rest of the euro area. Moreover, esti -
mations using model- based analyses suggest 
that coin flows between Germany and the euro 
area excluding Germany are virtually balanced. 
According to this finding, coin migration does 
not significantly influence the coin revenue of 
the Federal Republic of Germany. On the con -
trary, coin revenue results from meeting do -
mestic demand in Germany.Coin migration 
has no impact 
on the demand 
for coins in

15 The slight surplus of coin inflows to Germany over coin 
outflows could be the result of model and estimation un -
certainty. Another conceivable explanation is that people in 
Germany import a particularly large volume of euro coins 
into Germany from abroad in order to collect coins with 
the various national sides. This supposition is supported by 
the fact that the Federal Republic of Germany issues a par -
ticularly large number of collectors’ coins, which might re -
flect a higher propensity to collect coins in Germany.
