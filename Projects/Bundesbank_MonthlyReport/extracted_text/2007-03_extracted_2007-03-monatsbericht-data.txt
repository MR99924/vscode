Economy as a whole
The German economy continued to grow at a
robust pace in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Overall output rose by 0.9% after adjustment
for seasonal and calendar effects. The pace of
growth was, in fact, even somewhat higher
than in the third quarter (+0.8%). Calendar-
adjusted year-on-year growth in gross do-
mestic product (GDP) stood at 3.7% in the
fourth quarter. This sizeable increase was
attributable both to strong economic activity
and a number of special factors, which
means that the underlying cyclical trend is
likely to be overstated somewhat.
The external sector made a significant contri-
bution to the positive GDP result in the final
quarter of 2006. During the reporting period,
exports rose very sharply at 6% on the quar-
ter, although this was partly due to late re-
porting. Imports grew much less strongly at
11/C252%. In mathematical terms, external trade
contributed just over 2 percentage points to
economic growth. Furthermore, owing to the
mild weather conditions, real spending on
buildings went up by a seasonally adjusted
11/C254%. The figure for machinery and equip-
ment was1/C252%. By contrast, private consump-
tion was1/C254% up on the quarter. Although
there had been anticipatory effects in connec-
tion with the VAT increase on 1 January 2007
in the case of consumer durables, households
restricted their real expenditure on non-
durable goods. Final domestic demand con-
tributed just under1/C252percentage point to
overall growth. Given that a large part of theGDP

changes in inventories generated a strong
dampening impact.
Industry
Industry remained on a growth path at the
beginning of 2007. Output, for example,
went up by a seasonally and working-day ad-
justed 21/C254% in January following a slowdown
in the pace of growth in the final quarter of
2006. This was a 3% increase on the average
of the fourth quarter of last year. Despite a
change in the statistical reporting sample,
there was a sharp rise in industrial output.
The year-on-year increase went up to just
under 9%.
New industrial orders were, however, 1%
down on the month in January after seasonal
and calendar adjustment and1/C254% down on
the average of the fourth quarter. Domestic
new orders were up slightly on the fourth
quarter, whereas fewer export orders were re-
ceived, especially from non-euro-area coun-
tries. The fall in domestic demand for motor
vehicles was much more apparent than in the
final quarter of 2006. This was due primarily
to the sharp decline in household’s demand
for new passenger cars, which is, however, to
be seen against the backdrop of the substan-
tial anticipatory effects in the final quarter of
last year. The dampening effects of the VAT
increase can also be observed in traditional
retail purchases (excluding cars). According to
the data available so far, there was a sharp
drop in retail sales in January (41/C252%) with the
decline, above all, in consumer durables, as
expected, being very marked.Economic conditions in Germany*

7The seasonally adjusted value of exports of
goods in January remained at the Decemberlevel and was thus 1
1/C254% down on the fourth
quarter of 2006, for which very high exportfigures were recorded as a result of late statis-tical reporting. Nominal imports were 1
1/C252%
lower than in December when there hadbeen a particularly marked rise owing, notleast, to the aforementioned anticipatory ef-fects. Owing to a methodological change inthe compilation of data (movements ofgoods and services in connection with repairand maintenance work are no longer in-cluded in special trade), somewhat fewer ex-ports and imports have been recorded sincethe beginning of the year than in 2006, how-ever. The trade surplus expanded in Januaryby31 billion to 315
3/C254billion.
ConstructionThere was a sharp rise of 4% in construction
output in January after adjustment for sea-sonal and calendar effects. This was duemainly to the exceptionally mild weather.Substantial growth was achieved, above all,in the civil engineering sector, which hadlatterly proved to be quite volatile. After ad-justment for the number of working days, theoverall year-on-year increase in constructionoutput went up to 35%. However, a strongbase effect also played a part in this owing toa marked weather-induced decline in outputin January 2006.
After a poor result for December, there was a
decidedly sharp seasonally adjusted rise inconstruction demand of 15
1/C252% in January.
This represents an increase of 123/C254% on thefinal quarter of 2006. Alongside general con-
struction, growth in demand was especiallystrong in civil engineering. The public sectorplaced a greater number of orders in January– mainly road construction orders, after hav-ing significantly cut back its demand towardsthe end of last year. With a sharp rise in thenumber of orders received in January, indus-trial construction matched the favourabletrend of the fourth quarter. This is a reflectionof the growing importance of investment incapacity extensions given the positive generaldevelopments in the economy. When inter-preting this, however, it should be remem-bered that the mild weather not only favoursoutput but, as experience has shown, theplacing of orders. Demand for housing con-struction, which had been tending to beweaker again in the latter part of 2006, was1
1/C252% up on December in seasonally adjusted
terms.
Labour marketThe favourable development in the labour
market continued into the new year. Accord-ing to initial estimates by the Federal Statistic-al Office, the seasonally adjusted number ofpersons in work stood at 39.41 million inJanuary. This was 43,000 more than in De-cember and 543,000 up on the year. For thefirst time in a long while, there was an in-crease in short-time working in December.This was due to the introduction of seasonalshort-time working benefits in the construc-tion industry. The number of job vacancieswas on the decline in February. This, however,reflects a change in the recording of seasonaljob vacancies rather than a cyclical trend.Foreign trade

8According to Federal Employment Agency
figures, there was a further rise in the number
of vacancies for non-government-assisted
“normal” jobs subject to social security con-
tributions. The number of employees subject
to social security contributions in December
was 26,000 up on the month. This is equiva-
lent to a year-on-year increase of 452,000
persons.
There was a further perceptible decline in the
official unemployment figure in February. The
seasonally adjusted total number of persons
officially registered as out of work was 3.90
million, ie 826,000 lower than in the same
period last year. The month-on-month un-
employment rate fell from 9.5% to 9.3%. Be-
sides the favourable economic conditions, the
mild weather also contributed to this decline.
Prices
There was a marked increase in prices in the
international crude oil markets in February
2007. At US$583/C254, the spot quotation for a
barrel of Brent North Sea oil was, on average,
71/C252% higher than the January level. The main
reasons for this were the weather conditions
in the USA being colder than in January,
smaller supplies from OPEC and heightened
geopolitical tensions. The spot price was just
under US$61 as this report went to press.
Futures contracts with a maturity of six
months were US$23/C254higher than the spot
price, 18-month futures were up by US$5.
In the first two months of 2007, seasonally
adjusted import prices were 0.6% down on
the average of the fourth quarter of 2006.Furthermore, owing to a baseline effect in
the case of energy, the year-on-year rate of
increase went down to 0.8%. Industrial fac-
tory gate prices in January and February were
0.2% up on the final quarter of 2006. In this
case, too, the stronger price pressure at the
beginning of 2006 meant that there was a
fall in the year-on-year figure to 3.1% on an
average of the two-month period of January
and February.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose by
0.1% in February. There was quite a sharp
rise in the prices of energy and services. This
was offset to some extent by price reductions
for food products and industrial goods and
the continuing very subdued trend in housing
rents. The year-on-year rate of price increase
for goods (excluding tobacco products) was
1.4% in February 2007, compared with
0.7% in December 2006. The figures for ser-
vices (excluding rents) were 2.1% and 1.0%
respectively. This reflects the impact of the
VAT increase on price developments in the
first two months of the year. Year-on-year
consumer price inflation (CPI) remained un-
changed in February at 1.6%. The HICP infla-
tion rate stood at 1.9%, compared with
1.8% in the same period last year.Unemployment

Statutory health insurance scheme
In 2006, the statutory health insurance
scheme recorded a surplus of just under 32
billion, which matched the level attained in
the previous year.2It should be pointed out,
however, that the Federal grant paid to cover
non-insurance-related benefits, at 34.2 bil-
lion, on its own exceeded its prior-year value
by31.7 billion. Revenue and expenditure
both increased by 23/C254%. At almost 11/C252%,
overall growth in revenue from contributions
was significantly stronger than in previous
years. This development was partly influ-
enced by the favourable cyclical trend, owing
not least to the upturn in employment subject
to social security contributions evident since
the beginning of 2006. Income subject to
compulsory insurance (basic wage total) rose
by3/C254%. Furthermore, there was a strong
surge in the part-time low-paid employment
sector, which experienced a particularly ro-
bust increase in the first half of the year. Sub-
sequently, there was a slowdown in growth
in such “mini jobs”, for which the flat-rate
contributions and taxes had been raised from
25% to 30% in mid-2006. The contribution
rate relevant to health insurance institutions
increased from 11% to 13%, while the con-
tribution paid on behalf of recipients of un-
employment benefit II was concurrently re-
duced. The average overall contribution rate
remained largely unchanged, at 14.2%.
Expenditure on benefits in 2006 was up by
23/C254% on the year. One major reason for this
was the increase of almost 3% in spendingon hospital treatment, which, at just over
one-third, is the largest single cost item in
total health insurance expenditure. However,
the spending trend in this area decelerated
markedly towards the end of the year. The
entry into force of the “Act improving cost-
efficiency in pharmaceutical supply” (Gesetz
zur Verbesserung der Wirtschaflichkeit in der
Arzneimittelversorgung) not only halted the
previous trend towards massively rising ex-Quarterly

10Deutsche BundesbankRaising the statutory retirement age to 67
Comments presented to the Committee on Labour and Social Affairs of the Deutsche Bundestag
(public hearing on 26 February 2007)
Demographics and basic need for reform
The average period during which pensions are drawn increased
from approximately 11 years in 1970 to roughly 17 years in 2005.
At the same time, the average effective retirement age de-
creased by just over one year. The longer period for drawing
pensions is due primarily to the sharp rise in life expectancy. Ac-
cording to the mortality tables published by the Federal Statistic-
al Office, at the beginning of the 1970s the remaining life ex-
pectancy of 65-year-old women was 15.3 years and that of men
12.2 years. In the latest mortality table (2003/2005), by contrast,
women aged 65 are expected to live for a further 19.9 years and
men for a further 16.5 years. Over the course of the past four
years alone, the life expectancy of women has risen by 0.5 year
and that of men by 0.7 year. Based on the eleventh coordinated
population forecast published by the Federal Statistical Office,
the Federal Government expects both these figures to go up by
approximately 21/C252years by 2030. Based on the pension law sta-
tus quo , the welcome ongoing improvement in life expectancy
implies a continuous expansion of the benefits granted under
the statutory pension insurance scheme, meaning that revenue
has to be increased accordingly to finance this. If, firstly, the
negative effects on employment associated with a growing con-
tribution rate resulting from a widening tax wedge between
producer wages and consumer wages and, secondly, an interge-
nerational redistribution shift to the detriment of the younger
generation are to be avoided, the expansion of benefits must be
curbed. Both effects are ultimately based on the poorer return of
the statutory pension insurance scheme compared with funded
pension schemes. This can also be characterised as an implicit
tax.
From the perspective of the statutory pension insurance scheme,
it is not sufficient to merely raise the actual average retirement
age. Pension payments would then increase significantly not just
owing to additional contributions but also to the reduced pen-
sion mark-downs (or the additional pension mark-ups). This
would largely cancel out the effect of the shorter period for
drawing pensions. It is true that positive prefinancing effects
would occur during the adjustment period because contributions
would be paid for longer with immediate effect whereas pen-
sion payments would be lower initially. However, over time, the
higher individual pension claims would neutralise these effects.
The same is true of expanding employment subject to social se-
curity contributions, which can only lead to temporary relief for
the statutory pension insurance scheme. To achieve permanent
financial relief, the statutory retirement age has to be increased
to avoid the contribution rate from being continually raised or
the individual monthly pension payments from being lowered.
Reform approach of the Act adjusting the retirement age
of the statutory pension insurance scheme
The raising of the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2029
that is proposed in the draft Act adjusting the retirement age of
the statutory pension insurance scheme (RV-Altersgrenzenanpas-
sungsgesetz) does not equalise the increase of 21/C252years in lifeexpectancy. However, to ease the associated pressure on the con-
tribution rate, this is not actually necessary. The key requirement,
rather, is that rising life expectancy does not cause the ratio of
pensioners to contribution payers to go up. On an individual
case basis, therefore, an increase in the ratio of the pension re-
ceipt period to working years subject to contributions should be
avoided. If a 65-year-old insured person in 1970, for example,
had paid contributions for 45 years and had a statistical life ex-
pectancy of almost 77 years, this meant that his ratio of pension
receipt period to working life amounted to 261/C252%. By 2004, the
life expectancy for a 65-year-old man had increased to 811/C252years.
The probable period for drawing pensions thus already amount-
ed to 361/C252% of his working life. If the statutory retirement age is
not raised, then the relative period for drawing pensions is likely
to rise to 421/C252% by 2030, which corresponds to a statistical life
expectancy for a 65-year-old man by that time of over 84 years.
As things currently stand, raising the statutory retirement age
will lead to a ratio of 361/C252% in 2030 because the period for
drawing pensions will be shorter and working life will be longer.
Problematic exception
The draft Act adjusting the retirement age of the statutory pen-
sion insurance scheme further envisages that insurees who have
paid compulsory contributions for at least 45 years will continue
to be allowed to draw a full pension upon reaching 65 years of
age. However, this violates the principle of participative equiva-
lence on which the statutory pension insurance scheme is based.
In the future, virtually identical contribution payments will result
in different pension claims, due solely to the difference in the
number of years over which contributions were paid. While
someone who has paid compulsory contributions for 45 years
can draw a pension without reductions when s/he turns 65, insur-
ees who have paid the same total amount of contributions, on a
121/C252% higher annual income subject to compulsory insurance
but over a period of 40 years, face a pension deduction of 7.2%.
People with at least 45 years of compulsory insurance payments
are not only spared this cutback in benefit but they also profit
from the lower contribution rate, compared with the situation if
the statutory retirement age were not to be raised, and from the
associated larger pension increases. The statement of legislative
intent accompanying the draft act correctly identifies this as a
privilege for persons who have been insured for a particularly
long period of time which has to be financed by all other insured
persons.
Modified income safeguard clause
In addition to raising the statutory retirement age, the Act ad-
justing the retirement age of the statutory pension insurance
scheme also modifies the income safeguard clause which has, to
date, prevented the payable pension amount from being re-
duced as a result of a growing contribution rate, a higher share
of income used for private pension plans (Riester pensions) or a
rising pensioner ratio. Nominal benefit reductions are possible
only if, and dependent on the degree to which, the average re-
muneration of contribution payers falls. As a result, if nominal

DEUTSCHE
BUNDESBANK
Monthly Report
March 2007
11wage increases are only small then the aforementioned pension
formula factors which are intended to have a dampening effect
on adjustments are not triggered and the envisaged target val-
ues for the contribution rate cannot be met. Whenever as a re-
sult the pension adjustment, in comparison with the sum-total of
remuneration subject to social security contributions, is thus
greater than estimated in the projections, the pension level will
be irreversibly higher. This requires a permanently higher contri-
bution rate. Modifying the income safeguard clause means that
this situation will no longer be irreversible. In the years following
2010, positive pension adjustments are to be halved until the ac-
cumulated putative pension cuts have been clawed back. This is
to be welcomed as part of the planned slower growth in the con-
tribution rate.
Financial implications of the Act adjusting the retirement age
of the statutory pension insurance scheme
The financial implications of raising the statutory retirement age
depend on how the insured persons react. It may be argued that,
in the long term, it is largely irrelevant for the financial situation
of the statutory pension insurance scheme whether those affect-
ed actually retire at the age of 67 or before with a corresponding
pension deduction – as long as the deductions are sufficient in
actuarial terms. However, financial losses are expected to the ex-
tent that individual insurees find a more advantageous solution
by, say, claiming a disability pension. Furthermore, the dampen-
ing effect on the contribution rate caused by raising the retire-
ment age is dependent on the extent to which keeping older
persons in employment for longer impairs the job prospects of
younger people. Even in the extreme case of older workers com-
pletely crowding younger persons out of the employment mar-
ket, this would still ease the financial pressure on contribution
payers overall because pensions would not be drawn until a later
date and they would not be offset by actuarial mark-ups. More-
over, the more successful labour market reforms are at aligning
supply and demand, the weaker this crowding-out effect is likely
to be.
Feedback effects via the contribution rate
and sustainability factor
However, the financial relief will be partly cancelled out by coun-
tervailing effects. For example, the annual pension adjustments
will be larger as result of the lower contribution rate. Moreover,
the sustainability factor will dampen pension adjustments less if
the ratio of standard pensioners to average contribution payers
(pensioner ratio) increases at a slower rate. If, for example, the
actual age of retirement is put back to 67 years, the number of
standard pensioners will hardly change because a lower number
of pensioners would be accompanied by higher pensions per ca-
pita. However, the number of average contribution payers will
climb as labour force participation is higher overall. The pension-
er ratio will then be correspondingly lower. However, were the
actual retirement age to remain at 65, then the number of aver-
age contribution payers would remain largely unchanged but
the number of standard pensioners would fall. If the number ofpensioners were to remain the same, this would mean that they
could, on average, only draw a smaller average pension owing
to the deductions that would be due. Finally, the dampening ef-
fect on the contribution rate caused by raising the statutory re-
tirement age will be nullified increasingly to the extent that the
exception for insured persons who have paid compulsory contri-
butions for at least 45 years is applicable. The broader the defin-
ition of this group of people, the more expensive the exception
becomes and the larger the risk that the targeted contribution
rates of a maximum of 20% by 2020 or a maximum of 22% by
2030 are likely not to be met.
Prolonging working life is not just of significance
for the statutory pension insurance scheme
The discussions about the development of the statutory retire-
ment age do not only concern the statutory pension insurance
scheme but also have a bearing on the financing of the other so-
cial security systems, the central, state and local government
budgets and ultimately on the development of potential macro-
economic output. Only the income that has been generated is
available for distribution. This means that serious problems
would arise if an ever increasing section of the population were
released from working life and an ever longer period of pension
entitlement had to be financed. Yet this is precisely the situation
that Germany would be facing if the statutory retirement age
were to remain the same. As well as raising the statutory retire-
ment age, any other existing obstacles preventing older persons
from staying in employment for a longer period of time should
be removed. This notably includes the promotion of early retire-
ment that has been pursued for many years. The associated in-
centives have been keenly seized by employers and employees
alike, and expectations of early retirement have consequently
become entrenched. This is probably one reason why older
people often do not receive further training and the path to ne-
cessary further qualifications is abandoned too early. Therefore,
gradually raising the statutory retirement age sends out an im-
portant signal to all parties that working life has to be extended.
Need for further reform beyond 2030
Demographic developments will not come to a halt in 2030. The
projections suggest rather that life expectancy will continue to
increase. It would therefore be ill-advised to give the impression
that raising the retirement age to 67 marks the end of the line.
To give all parties greater planning certainty it is therefore worth
considering pegging the statutory retirement age directly to
changing life expectancy. A discussion of these points could be
given a firmer foundation if the Federal Government extended
the usual projection horizon for the development of the statu-
tory retirement scheme beyond 2030, which has been the stand-ard end-date ever since the Pension Reform Act of 1992. By con-
trast, at an international level, calculations are often made for
the period up to 2050. Even if the uncertainties grow with the
projection period, it still appears to be appropriate to extend the
forecast horizon.

porarily) reversed it. In 2006 as a whole, how-
ever, spending still rose by just under 2%
(after +161/C252% in 2005). Following the initial
marked decrease in expenditure on dental
treatment owing to the introduction of fixed
subsidies for dentures on 1 January 2005,
there was a countermovement (+4%).
Spending on sickness benefit fell again by
nearly 3%. However, a year-on-year increase
was observed in the final quarter.
In 2007, health insurance institutions are fa-
cing both a 31.7 billion cut in the Federal
grant and additional expenditure of around
31 billion as a result of the increase in VAT.
This has increased pressure to raise contribu-
tion rates. The current average overall contri-
bution rate is 14.8% (including special contri-butions from employees and pensioners) and
is thus1/C252percentage point above the level at
the end of 2006. The resulting potential in-
crease in contribution revenue could result in
a further surplus, which is necessary in order
to reduce some health insurance institutions’
persisting debts and, in part, to increase the
statutory reserves. However, the “Act to pro-
mote competition among statutory health in-
surance institutions” (GKV-Wettbewerbs-
st/C228rkungsgesetz) , which comes into force on
1 April 2007, may trigger a structural shift in
the contributions trend for the statutory
health insurance scheme if institutions take
up the wide-ranging new options for introdu-
cing varied deductible and premium refund
tariffs. The overall contribution rate will then
become less meaningful.
Statutory long-term care insurance
scheme
A surplus of just under 31/C252billion was record-
ed in the statutory long-term care insurance
scheme last year. However, the positive bal-
ance is entirely attributable to the one-off
additional revenue generated from bringing
forward the transfer deadline for social secur-
ity contributions.3As a result, almost 13
monthly contributions were received in 2006.
By contrast, in the final annual outturn,
which will not be published until mid-2007,
contribution receipts will be recorded on an
accruals basis rather than on a cash flow
basis. Consequently, they will not be affected
by the one-off additional revenue (estimatedQuarterly

rather than the aforementioned surplus,
there is likely to be a deficit of a similar size.
Expenditure rose at the moderate rate of 1%.
The shift from cash to non-cash benefits con-
tinued. While the former fell by 11/C252%, the
latter rose by 2%. Despite the cyclical upturn
on the employment market, a deficit is ex-
pected for 2007. As a result, the liquid re-
serves, which are likely to have increased to
331/C252billion in 2006 owing to the transfer
date for contributions being brought forward,
will decrease as in previous years.
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market
was very buoyant in January 2007. German is-
suers sold debt securities for a total of 3116.0
billion, compared with 376.2 billion in Decem-
ber. At 386.9 billion, redemptions were some-
what lower than of late, resulting in a final
figure of 331.7 billion after taking account of
repayments and changes in issuers’ holdings
of their own debt securities. In addition, in
January sales of foreign bonds in Germany
reached a record level ( 327.6 billion). As a re-
sult, net sales of domestic and foreign debt
securities amounted to 359.4 billion.
In the month under review, domestic credit
institutions accounted for the majority of bor-
rowing by residents in the German bond mar-
ket (324.7 billion). Specialised credit institu-
tions issued debt securities worth 314.6 bil-
lion net. Sales of other bank debt securities,which can be structured particularly flexibly,
were also notably high ( 316.1 billion). By con-
trast, the volume of public Pfandbriefe and
mortgage Pfandbriefe outstanding went
down by 33.7 billion and 32.3 billion respect-
ively.
In January the public sector issued bonds to
the net value of 35.8 billion. Central govern-
ment accounted for the majority of this
amount ( 35.1 billion). Central government in-
creased its short-term borrowing with two-
year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) in the
amount of 36.5 billion and Treasury discount
paper (Bubills) in the amount of 30.4 billion
and at the same time issued 34.0 billion
worth of 30-year Federal bonds (Bunds). By
contrast, central government reduced its bor-
rowing (net debt) arising from ten-year Fed-
eral bonds (Bunds) as well as from five-year
Federal notes (Bobls) by 34.8 billion and 31.2
billion respectively. This can be explained by
high redemptions and changes in issuers’
holdings respectively. State government
tapped the capital market by a total of 30.8
billion in January.
In the month under review, net sales of debt
securities by non-financial corporations on
the German bond market amounted to 31.2
billion. Only commercial paper was sold on
balance, while the volume of longer-term
corporate bonds outstanding fell by 31.5 bil-
lion.
On the buyers’ side, credit institutions were
again the main purchasers of debt securities
in January. On balance, they acquired 322.6
billion worth of debt securities, the vast ma-Sales of debt

suers ( 321.9 billion). With purchases of inter-
est-bearing securities from public-sector bor-
rowers amounting to 36.3 billion and net
sales of bonds and notes issued by private
borrowers worth 35.5 billion, their purchases
and sales of domestic debt securities almost
cancelled each other out. Resident non-banks
added debt securities to their portfolios in the
amount of 312.9 billion and purchased a
roughly equivalent amount of domestic and
foreign instruments ( 37.0 billion and 35.9 bil-
lion respectively). Of German debt securities,
bonds issued by private borrowers found par-
ticular favour among investors ( 39.5 billion).
Non-residents purchased 323.8 billion worth
of bonds in the German market, also exhibit-
ing a marked preference for paper issued by
private sector borrowers ( 321.9 billion).Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
continued to pick up in January. Overall, Ger-
man enterprises issued new shares with a
market value of 31.9 billion, of which 31.6
billion came from listed enterprises. In add-
ition, German investors disposed of a consid-
erable volume of foreign equities ( 321.7 bil-
lion). In this connection, a major role was
played by two individual transactions, one of
which involved the dissolution of a direct in-
vestment relationship. On balance, domestic
credit institutions were the sole purchasers of
shares ( 34.8 billion), investing 39.5 billion in
German company shares. On the other hand,
during the month under review, domestic
non-banks, on balance, sold both domestic
and foreign shares to the value of 34.4 billion
and317.0 billion respectively. Foreign invest-
ors likewise reduced their investment in the
German equity market ( 33.2 billion).
Mutual fund shares
In January, domestic mutual funds saw in-
flows of 35.9 billion, most of which accrued
to specialised funds which are reserved for in-
stitutional investors. Of the mutual funds
open to the general public, open-end real es-
tate funds in particular were able to record
net inflows ( 32.0 billion), despite the trad-
itionally high dividend payments which occur
in the month of January. Mixed funds, mixed
security-based funds and money market
funds also disposed of a modest amount of
certificates. By contrast, equity and bond-
based funds were again obliged to make net
repayments to investors of 31.2 billion andSales and purchases

foreign mutual fund shares on the German
equity market amounted to 35.9 billion.
Mutual fund shares were purchased almost
exclusively by domestic investors. Credit insti-
tutions increased their holdings of domestic
mutual fund shares by 30.3 billion while rais-
ing their holdings of foreign mutual fund
shares by 30.1 billion. By contrast, domestic
non-banks considerably increased their hold-
ings in mutual funds by acquiring domestic
mutual funds in the amount of 35.4 billion
and foreign mutual funds worth 35.8 billion.
At the same time, foreign investors purchased
30.2 billion worth of mutual fund shares in

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus
– in unadjusted terms – of 311 billion in Janu-
ary, down 34.6 billion on the very high level
of the previous month. Although the trade
surplus continued to rise, the deficit on invis-
ible current transactions, which comprise
services, income and current transfers, was
greater.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-
plus increased by 35.1 billion in January to
316.2 billion. After adjustment for seasonal
and calendar variations, it increased by 31 bil-
lion to 3153/C254billion. The value of exports of
goods was unchanged on the month, where-
as nominal imports fell by 11/C252%.4Compared
with the average of the fourth quarter of2006, seasonally adjusted exports fell by
11/C254% in January, whereas the level of imports
was the same as the fourth quarter average.
Invisible current transactions showed a deficit
of33.8 billion in January, compared with a
surplus of 35.9 billion in December 2006.
This can be attributed to a deterioration in all
three sub-accounts. The services account ran
a deficit of 33.7 billion, compared with a sur-
plus of 31.1 billion in the previous month.
Net receipts from cross-border income fell by
30.5 billion to 31.8 billion. In addition, cur-
rent transfers recorded a deficit of 31.9 bil-
lion, following a surplus of 32.5 billion in the
previous month.
In January, cross-border portfolio investment
led to net capital exports of 34.9 billion, com-
pared with inflows of 33.8 billion in the previ-
ous month. The main reason for the reversal
was greater German investment abroad, with
German investors purchasing foreign secur-
ities for 325.8 billion (compared with 33.9 bil-
lion in December). They bought bonds ( 322.2
billion) as well as money market paper ( 35.4
billion) and mutual fund shares ( 35.9 billion)
but sold shares ( 37.7 billion). Foreign invest-
ors increased their portfolio investment in
Germany, too ( 320.9 billion, compared with
37.7 billion), likewise favouring bonds ( 316.6
billion) and money market paper ( 37.3 billion)
but reducing their equity portfolios in Ger-
many ( 33.2 billion).
4Owing to a methodological change in the compilation
of data (movements of goods and services in connection
with repair and maintenance work are no longer included
in special trade), the exports and imports shown have
been somewhat lower since January than in 2006.Purchases of

16Direct investment resulted in net inflows of
funds ( 33.2 billion). These can be attributed
mainly to German firms’ withdrawals of cap-
ital from abroad ( 34.5 billion). An asset dis-
posal in the banking sector which more than
offset further lending of financial resources to
foreign affiliates was a significant contribu-
tory factor here. Foreign enterprises likewise
marginally lowered their investment in Ger-
many at the beginning of the year ( 31.4 bil-
lion), whereas, in the previous month, they
had still been increasing their investment
(313.2 billion). The capital was withdrawn as
part of intra-group credits between foreign
firms and their German affiliates.
As with direct investment, there were also net
capital imports resulting from other invest-
ment ( 38.2 billion). These can be attributed
mainly to transactions of non-banks, which
resulted in inflows amounting to 310.3 billion.
The financial operations of general govern-
ment, which primarily withdrew funds tem-
porarily placed in its foreign bank accounts,
accounted for 36.0 billion. With regard to en-
terprises and individuals, unsecuritised funds
amounting to 34.3 billion were imported into
Germany. By contrast, there were marginal
net capital exports in the banking system
(32.1 billion). Outflows of funds at the Bun-
desbank amounting to 37.1 billion net –
which were primarily a result of an increase in
claims in connection with the large-value pay-
ment system TARGET – were offset by inflows
of35.0 billion at the credit institutions.

17German balance of
payments in 2006Last year German exporters again
benefited from the generally strong
growth in export markets. The heavy
global demand for capital goods,
which account for a substantial part of
Germany’s range of exports, also
played a role. Overall, the value of Ger-
many’s exports of goods grew by
133/C254% in 2006. Imports actually grew
somewhat more vigorously at 161/C252%.
This was due largely to the surge in the
prices of energy and industrial raw
materials. Even so, the surpluses in the
trade balance and in the current
account reached record highs. The
current account balance rose to 5% of
GDP.
The counterpart within the balance of
payments is to be found in Germany’s
extensive net capital exports. German
banks, in particular, saw a sharp in-
crease in their net external assets last
year, a development which can certain-
ly be regarded in part as a reflection of
the current account surplus. Germany
also experienced fairly substantial out-
flows of capital as a result of direct in-
vestment. By contrast, portfolio invest-
ment, which usually reflects changing
conditions in the financial markets
particularly quickly, closed almost in
balance in 2006.

18Current account
The underlying international conditions were
again favourable for German exporters in
2006. The global economy expanded at just
over 5% and therefore more sharply than in
2005. The volume of world trade grew by
9% compared with 71/C252% a year earlier. The
shifts in international exchange rate patterns
had little effect on German enterprises. The
effective overall appreciation of the euro was
marginal (at1/C252%). It has to be remembered
that 42% of German exports are destined for
the euro area. Here, nominal exchange rate
movements vis-/C224-vis the currencies of non-
euro-area countries are important only to the
extent that they affect the competitiveness of
competing suppliers from these third coun-
tries. The appreciation of the euro was offset
by a further improvement in the cost situation
of German enterprises over that of their main
foreign competitors, with the result that the
overall price competitiveness of German ex-
porters in 2006 rose by a further3/C254%o n
average.1Germany’s relative price advantage
amounted to 61/C252% on a long-term average.
German export markets expanded even faster
in 2006 than in 2005. German enterprises
also benefited from the fact that capital
goods constitute a relatively high proportion
of their total range of products. The value of
their exports of goods increased by 133/C254%i n
2006 and therefore more sharply than at any
time since the boom year of 2000. In real
terms, exports grew by 111/C254%. Although, at
21/C252%, prices rose twice as fast as in 2005, ex-
port prices actually increased fairly moderate-
ly given the marked rise in prices overall andespecially of industrial raw materials (+34%
in euro terms) and crude oil (+181/C252% in the
case of Brent crude).
The strongest stimuli on German exports in
2006 came from countries outside the euro
area as the overall economic output of these
countries grew more dynamically than that of
the euro area. German exports to non-euro-
area countries expanded by 161/C254% in nomin-
al terms and 141/C254% in real terms. The upshot
was that Germany increased its market pos-
ition outside the euro area in 2006.
Greatest export growth in the major regional
markets was achieved in the Russian Feder-
ation (351/C254%), whose demand for German
goods was fuelled by the further increase in
revenue from oil and gas sales. There was
likewise a significant upturn in the amount of
goods exported to the OPEC countries
(93/C254%) even though the rate of growth was
somewhat below the levels of the previous
two years. Exports to China grew dynamically
again (+291/C252%) after almost stagnating in
2005. Evidently the economic policy meas-
ures taken there in 2006 to check the invest-
ment boom have still not exerted any discern-
ible negative effects on German exports. Ex-
ports to the emerging markets in South-East
Asia, which had also risen only slightly in
2005, likewise grew in double figures again
(143/C254%) in 2006. By contrast, exports to
Japan, at 4%, were somewhat weaker than
in 2005. That was probably due in part to the
appreciation of the euro against the yen.

19Goods exports to the United States were up
by 121/C252% following an increase of 63/C254% the
year before. At first glance, this is surprisingin that the US economy had been expandingvirtually at the same rate in both years andthe euro appreciated slightly against theUS dollar in 2006. The main reason for thesuccessful sales development in the US mar-ket was the increased demand for Germanchemical products and machinery and equip-ment as well as for motor vehicles. Exports tothe new EU member states, with which trad-ing links have become increasingly closer overthe years, also grew extremely vigorously(+21
1/C252%). The salient feature in this develop-
ment was the 29% increase in exports toPoland, Germany’s most important customeramong the new member states.
German exports of goods to other euro-area
countries again grew sharply, at 11%, albeitnot quite so dynamically as sales to non-euro-area countries. In real terms, the increaseamounted to 8%. The further 1
3/C254% improve-
ment in Germany’s price competitivenessover that of its euro-area partners was a con-tributory factor here. The outcome was thatGerman enterprises increased their marketshares in the euro area during the periodunder review. Export growth rates divergedwidely from one country to another, but thiswas partly a reflection of the differences ineconomic growth in the various memberstates. It was also due in part to the fact thatexports to those euro-area countries whoseprice competitiveness was deteriorating fast-est in relation to that of Germany received acorrespondingly bigger boost. For example,prices and costs in Luxembourg, Ireland,Spain and Greece increased quite sharply
compared with those in Germany whereasthe corresponding rates in Austria, Franceand Finland were only marginally above thosein Germany. Differing developments in wagecosts were the primary reason for this. Bycontrast, the further increase in energy pricesin 2006 hardly changed bilateral competitivepositions as it affected all euro-area countriesto a similar extent.DM bn € bn

20All major German export sectors participated
in the dynamic growth in the world economy
in 2006.2The manufacturers of capital
goods, who account for 44% and therefore
constitute the largest group of German
exporters, benefited from the brisk pace of
global investment. The manufacturers of
machinery and equipment, for example,
achieved a 101/C252% increase in export earn-
ings. The car industry increased exports by
71/C252%. Exports of goods in the information
and communications technology (ICT) sector
expanded by 41/C254%. Growth was probably
much faster in real terms as the prices of
these goods again fell significantly.
The value of exports of intermediate goods,
which account for almost one-third of Ger-
man exports, was actually 121/C254% higher in
2006 than a year earlier. German producers
passed on a sizeable part of the considerable
cost increases arising from industrial raw ma-
terials and crude oil, which are required in
large measure for the manufacture of inter-
mediate goods, to their customers at home
and abroad. For example, the export earnings
from basic metals and fabricated metal prod-
ucts rose by 213/C254%, but almost 60% of this
increase was price-related. Exports of chem-
ical products likewise expanded exceptionally
fast in nominal terms. In this case it was pri-
marily the higher energy costs that induced
manufacturers to increase their export pricesStructure of and trends in regional

Deutsche Bundesbank2The picture of the breakdown of exported and import-
ed goods is distorted by the large percentage of goods
which are still not classifiable by sector. Consequently,
the rates of change for the individual categories of goods
and main groupings cannot be aggregated to form an

21markedly. Exports of consumer goods also in-
creased sharply (+81/C254%).
Nominal imports of goods grew by 161/C252%i n
2006 and – as in 2005 – therefore faster thanexports. In real terms, foreign trade flows ex-panded at the same rate (+11
1/C254%) in both
directions as the price of imports increasedmore than twice as much as exports (5
1/C254%).
This rise was due principally to the substan-tially higher prices of imported energy andintermediate goods, which generally absorb alarge percentage of raw materials. Further-more, the increased price of raw materials inworld markets was offset to only a marginalextent by the appreciation of the euro againstthe US currency, in which approximately one-third of the imports from non-euro-areacountries were invoiced in 2006. By contrast,the import prices of consumer goods roseonly moderately, and imported capital goodswere actually cheaper.
3All in all, the value of
the increased imports of the various categor-ies of goods diverged more in 2006 than thecorresponding volumes.
Germany’s terms of trade deteriorated further
(by 2
3/C254%) in the period under review. As this
was due primarily to the increased prices ofimported energy and raw materials, Germancustomers were virtually unable to substituteGerman products for foreign goods whichhad tended to become more expensive. Over-all, real imports increased more sharply thanthey had done for the past eight years. Thiswas due, first, to the substantial expansion inexports, whose import content had risen toalmost 42% by the year 2005 and probablyincreased further in 2006, and, second, to astrong recovery in domestic demand. The lat-
ter development was to some extent the re-sult of anticipatory effects of the increase invalue added tax which came into force on1 January 2007. These anticipatory effectsreached their peak in the second half of theyear.
In terms of value, imports of energy expand-
ed most rapidly (24
3/C254%) in 2006. However,
just over 90% of this rise was due to price in-creases. The overall decline in purchasingpower associated with this amounted to
1/C252%
of GDP . At the beginning of the 1970s and1980s, when oil prices had likewise risen rap-idly and energy input in production was stillrelatively high, the decline in purchasingImports

22power in relation to GDP had almost touched
11/C252% at times.
The value of imports of intermediate goods
likewise increased perceptibly (+131/C252%) in
2006. Almost half the increase was related to
prices. In the case of imports of basic metals
and fabricated metal products, which record-
ed a nominal 261/C252% year-on-year increase in
value, as much as two-thirds of the increase
was due to higher prices. The value of chem-
ical products exported to Germany by foreign
manufacturers rose by 101/C254%. However,
two-fifths of this increase resulted from high-
er prices.
Imports of machinery and equipment re-
ceived an exceptionally strong boost last year
owing to the fact that the propensity to invest
had again risen sharply. Foreign manufactur-
ers of machinery saw a 91/C254% increase in the
value of their sales in Germany. However,
price rises here were modest. Imports of
motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers in-
creased by a nominal 61/C252% and at constant
prices by almost as much. The aforemen-
tioned anticipatory effects of the increase in
value added tax were a contributory factor in
this. That is particularly true of the imported
consumer electronics, which also benefited
from the increased demand in the run-up to
the FIFA World Cup. Total imports of ICT
goods rose by 71/C252%. As the downward trend
in the import prices of these products had
continued, the rise in real terms was much
greater than that.
Nominal imports from the euro area increased
by a total of 151/C252% in the year under review.The cyclical upturn in Germany benefited all
euro-area countries. However, it was those
countries whose price competitiveness had
faired relatively well against that of Germany
which gained most from the stronger domes-
tic demand. Although in terms of value im-
ports of goods from the euro area increased
somewhat less sharply than imports from
non-euro-area countries (171/C254%), they rose
just as steeply in real terms. This was in turn
the result of the above-average increase in
the prices of energy and raw materials, the
bulk of which are imported from non-euro-
area countries.
Accordingly, imports from the major oil and
gas-producing countries, such as the Russian
Federation and the OPEC countries, recorded
particularly high growth rates (351/C252%a n d
171/C252% respectively). Imports of goods from
China also rose strongly again (+191/C252%). By
contrast, supplies from the emerging markets
of South-East Asia grew much more sluggish-
ly (+73/C254%). German imports from the ten
countries which acceded to the EU in 2004
increased even more sharply than in the previ-
ous two years (+191/C254%). Furthermore, the in-
crease in US exports to Germany reached
double figures for the first time since the
boom year of 2000 (16%). The appreciation
of the euro against the yen was a contribu-
tory factor in the sharp rise in imports from
Japan (9%) as this made Japanese goods sub-
stantially cheaper.
Even though the value of imports in 2006 in-
creased slightly faster than that of exports,
there was still a rise in the trade surplus be-
cause the volume of exports was again muchRegional

23greater than that of imports. The surplus rose
by34 billion to a record 31621/C254billion. The
surplus would have been even larger if theterms of trade had not deteriorated further asa result of the increased prices of energy andraw materials. At the same time, the deficiton current invisible transactions with non-residents declined by 39
3/C254billion to 327 bil-
lion. This meant that the current account rana surplus of 3116
1/C252billion, which was 3131/C252
billion up on the year.4The current account
surplus amounted to 5% of nominal GDPand 6% of the domestic sectors’ disposableincome.
The smaller deficit on current invisible trans-
actions with non-residents, which compriseservices, income and current transfers, wasdue to improvements in all three sub-accounts. The services account, whose deficitdeclined by 35
3/C254billion to 323 billion, made a
significant contribution to this outturn. Thiswas partly the result of the turnaround in thebalance on cross-border insurance servicesfrom - 31
3/C254billion to + 31 billion. This was due
to the fact that for German reinsurers the re-lation of receipts from premiums to their pay-ments of claims to non-residents improvedwhereas in the case of foreign reinsurers theirbusiness operations in Germany deteriorated.Another factor was the net increase of 32
1/C254
billion in receipts from merchanting trade.
The surplus on cross-border financial servicesshowed only a slight increase (of 3
1/C252billion).
By contrast, the surpluses achieved in trans-port services, the second-largest service area,declined by 31
1/C252billion. The sharp growth in
German imports of goods, which are handledmore frequently by foreign carriers than ex-ports are, might have been a contributory
factor here.
The deficit on foreign travel, which is the
most important component of cross-borderservices, declined by 32
3/C254billion in 2006. The
reason was that receipts rose by 111/C254% while
expenditure fell marginally. On the revenueside, a major role was played by additional re-ceipts from the FIFA World Cup in Germanyin the second and third quarters of the year.Spending on overnight stays and other con-sumption by foreign visitors to the World Cupin Germany, including purchases of tickets forthe individual football matches and expend-iture on journeys within Germany, had a posi-tive impact here.
5The overall effect of the
World Cup on Germany’s revenue from cross-border services, which was spread essentiallybetween May and July, totalled just under31
1/C252billion, two-thirds of which came from
EU countries. Overall, more than half of therise in travel receipts in the year under reviewwas due to the World Cup.
German travel expenditure abroad, by con-
trast, was
1/C254% below its 2005 level. However,
expenditure associated with trips to othereuro-area countries, which account for morethan half of total German travel expenditure,remained unchanged whereas for the firsttime since 2002 less was spent on journeys tonon-euro-area countries.

items of - 3181/C252billion in 2006) and the current invisible
transactions combine to form the current account bal-
ance.

24In the year under review net receipts from
cross-border income increased by 321/C254billion
to323 billion. This was due primarily to the
rise of 32 billion in the surplus on investment
income to 3241/C254billion. Here receipts from
investment grew by 3321/C252billion (to 31821/C252
billion) and expenditure by only 3301/C252billion
(to31581/C254billion). Furthermore, there was a
slight decline in the net earnings from em-
ployment paid to non-residents.
The net rise in income from foreign assets
was due to the net rise in income from loans
to non-residents, which more than compen-
sated for the decline in net income from dir-
ect investment and the increase in net ex-
penditure on debt services in connection with
portfolio investment. In the process, both in-
come and expenditure rose sharply in the
area of cross-border credit interest payments,
which are essentially due to bank lending.
This development is primarily the result of the
increase in short-term interest rates at home
and abroad. The volume of bank loans also
increased substantially. In addition, the cross-
border credit interest payments of German
enterprises and households to non-residents
in 2006 grew more than twice as fast as simi-
lar payments in the opposite direction. This
might be associated with the fact that Ger-
man enterprises are increasingly financing the
acquisition of foreign firms through borrow-
ing abroad and therefore the cost of cross-
border foreign debt servicing is likewise
greater. This is consistent with the fact that in
2006 worldwide merger and acquisition
(M&A) operations showed a sharp rise (see
pages 32 and 33).Major items of the balance

25The increase in net expenditure on portfolio
investment was due to the substantial rise in
dividend payments to foreign investors. This
was a reflection of the discernible improve-
ment in German enterprises’ profitability.
Overall expenditure on direct investment
grew faster than the corresponding income, a
development which was likewise due to
larger interest charges and dividend pay-
ments.
The deficit on current transfers to non-
residents decreased by 313/C254billion to 3263/C254
billion in 2006. This was the result of the 33
billion decline in the deficit on public trans-
fers, one contributory factor here being larger
tax revenue from non-residents. Another fac-
tor was the decline in the net contributions to
the EU budget due principally to rising re-
ceipts under the Common Agricultural Policy.
On the expenditure side, the greater contri-
bution payable to the EU from Germany’s rev-
enue from value added tax and the lower
German payments to the EU based on nation-
al product more or less cancelled each other
out. By contrast, the deficit on private trans-
fers increased by 311/C254billion. The indemnifi-
cation payments from the “Remembrance,
Responsibility and Future” foundation, which
are made in equal parts by the private and
public sectors, amounted – five years after
their inauguration – to barely 31/C254billion com-
pared with 31/C252billion in 2005. This means
that the funds provided have now been
almost fully paid out.Financial transactions
The transactions recorded in Germany’s finan-
cial account with non-residents last year are
to be seen, first, in connection with the large
Germany current account surplus. Second,
they were largely determined by factors em-
anating from the international financial mar-
kets. In the light of the sustained buoyancy of
the world economy and the better earnings
outlook for many enterprises, stock prices
rose sharply worldwide during the year under
review and ended the year almost everywhere
at close to their multi-year highs.6At the€b n

26same time, bond yields in the course of the
year rose slightly, albeit with some sharp fluc-
tuations. Interest rates in the euro area saw
the sharpest upturn, with the result that
interest rate differentials moved in favour of
euro-denominated financial instruments.
While the Fed had been holding the Federal
Funds target rate unchanged at 5.25% since
June 2006 and the Bank of Japan made
merely an initial increase in the overnight rate
last year in July, raising it to 0.25%, the Gov-
erning Council of the ECB continued its policy
of gradual monetary policy tightening
throughout the year. As a result of shifts in
the relative cyclical and interest rate patterns,
the euro appreciated by approximately 5%
on a weighted average last year; its external
value improved even more against the
US dollar (111/C252%) and the yen (13%).
Given such a setting, internationally oriented
players extended their cross-border invest-
ments further. This can also be seen in the
amounts of capital that flowed in and out of
Germany. The outcome was that in 2006
Germany recorded substantial net outflows
of funds, which, in the aggregate, exceeded
the surplus on current account. The “Errors
and omissions” item in the balance of pay-
ments recorded a positive residual of 330 bil-
lion.
Germany’s portfolio transactions with non-
residents, which, as a rule, are quick to reflect
investors’ changing assessments, were almost
in balance in 2006. All in all, they ended the
year with modest net capital imports of 31
billion compared with net outflows of 324 bil-
lion in 2005. The reversal was due to the factFinancial transactions

27that, owing to the favourable financial mar-
ket conditions in Germany, German investors’securities acquisitions abroad did not matchthe previous year’s record whereas non-residents again invested quite substantially inthe German securities markets.
Although foreign asset holders likewise pur-
chased fewer German securities in 2006 thanin 2005 ( 3160
1/C252billion compared with 3179
billion), the amount invested was still farabove the average investment sum in theGerman market since the start of monetaryunion ( 3133 billion) and – as mentioned
above – was also slightly in excess of Germanresidents’ purchases of securities abroad.Non-resident investors focused most of theirattention on German debt securities andadded a significant amount of these to theirportfolios ( 3124 billion compared with
3156
1/C252billion in 2005). The first increase for
six years in long-term German bond marketinterest rates and the associated price lossespossibly curbed non-residents’ acquisitions –despite the eventuality of valuation gains expost owing to the appreciation of the euro. Inany case it was obvious that in the secondquarter of 2006, a period of rising interestrates, foreign investors were reluctant to buyGerman debt securities. As in earlier years,they focused on private-sector bonds ( 372
billion), notably bank debt securities. Thesehave an interest rate spread over Federalbonds (Bunds), which enjoy a first-class creditrating and a high degree of liquidity. Thisinterest rate spread of bank debt securitiesdoubled for a time to more than 30 basispoints despite heavy demand and did notease again somewhat until almost the end ofthe year. It is also possible that the de facto
preference of non-residents for bank debt se-curities arose in connection with supply fac-tors in the case of government issues, thereason being that, owing to the favourablecash balances of central and state govern-ment, net sales of public bonds amounted tono more than 352
1/C252billion and thereby
reached a five-year low. Foreign investors ac-quired longer-term (German) governmentpaper worth a total of 353
1/C252billion. German
money market instruments, which are gener-ally suitable for hedging against price risks attimes of rising interest rates, were purchasedby non-residents only during the first fewmonths of last year, consistent with thechanges in interest rates. Over the year as awhole, there was a small net sale of moneymarket instruments ( 31
1/C252billion).€b n

28The momentum of the global economy and
the vigorous cyclical upswing in Germany also
strengthened the German share market dur-
ing the period under review. For the fifth year
in succession the share market recorded a rise
in value and also developed more favourably
than the stock exchanges of other industrial
countries. The rally was borne by more opti-
mistic estimates from analysts on corporate
earnings, vigorous M&A activity worldwide
and – as measured by the implied volatility of
the CDAX – the comparatively low degree of
uncertainty about future share price move-
ments. This uncertainty jumped only briefly
between mid-May and June when anxiety
about future economic developments in the
United States sharpened market participants’
risk awareness. Foreign investors benefited
from the increasing value of German shares
last year and contributed decisively to this in-
crease through their purchases. They pur-
chased continuously throughout the year,
buying German equities worth a total of
3271/C252billion (compared with 3211/C252billion in
2005). A substantial percentage of German
shares is now held by foreigners. In the case
of DAX-listed enterprises, on which inter-
national investors frequently focus their
attention, this percentage is estimated to be
more than 50%.7
Foreign investors also acquired mutual fund
shares of domestic investment companies
worth 391/C252billion; this was only slightly less
than in the record year of 2000 when 311 bil-
lion in foreign resources accrued to German
funds. Part of this capital presumably likewise
accrued to the German share market indirect-
ly.The fact that the underlying sentiment in Ger-
man financial markets was much more opti-
mistic than in many other financial centres
around the world can also be seen in the in-
vestment behaviour of German residents in
2006. Although their investment in foreign
securities markets likewise increased in the
course of their investment and diversification
plans, their net expenditure on investment
outside Germany was discernibly less than in
the previous year. For example, German resi-
dents spent 31591/C252billion on acquiring se-
curitised paper abroad compared with 3203
billion in the record year of 2005. The main
contributory factor to this decline was a shift
in their investment preferences vis-/C224-vis equi-
ties. In 2005 German residents had invested
317 billion in the shares of foreign enterprises
but in the year under review they became net
sellers ( 361/C252billion). The withdrawal was con-
fined to the second quarter of 2006 and pos-
sibly took place in connection with the emer-
ging uncertainty about the US economy in
that period when market expectations sud-
denly turned and investors reassessed the
risks in the share markets, especially vis-/C224-vis
the United States. This line of reasoning is
confirmed at least by the fact that German in-
vestors sold shares in listed US corporations
worth 34 billion during this period. Another
possible motive is that the German share
market expanded by 211/C252% and therefore
more sharply than other major markets as
witnessed by, for example, the Japanese Nik-
7See Factbook of the Deutsches Aktieninstitut 2006,
which contains data on the foreign ownership of approxi-
mately half of the DAX-listed enterprises, which, in the
aggregate, account for about two-thirds of the stock

the year will also have been a factor in Ger-mans’ more cautious investment behaviouroutside the monetary union.

By contrast, investment companies domiciledabroad recorded further inflows of fundseven if in this case, too, German residents in-vested somewhat less in 2006 than in 2005.As a result of transactions, the volume ofmutual fund assets under their managementincreased by 324
1/C252billion (compared with
3431/C252billion in 2005). A substantial percent-
age of the resources flowing abroad accruedto the foreign subsidiaries of German invest-ment companies.

German savers, however, continued to showgreat interest in the longer-term interest-bearing instruments of foreign issuers. Theoutflows in this segment of the financial ac-count amounted in 2006 to 3134
1/C252billion;
this means that they were almost equally asvoluminous as in the previous year ( 3137 bil-
lion). Interest-bearing securities from publicsector borrowers in other euro-area countries,which are regularly added to portfolios owingto their slight yield spread (averaging 11 basispoints over the year) over the benchmarkBund, were in particularly heavy demand(3113
1/C252billion), notably from the financial
managers of domestic banks. The efforts ofinstitutional investors to ensure greater ma-turity matching between assets and liabilitiesin their balance sheets in connection with thenew regulatory framework Solvency II prob-ably also contributed to the structural shift indemand in favour of longer-term interest-
bearing instruments.
Euro-denominated debt securities were not
the only ones to find favour with Germanresidents. Foreign currency bonds were in de-mand, too, despite the strength of the euroand the continuing global current accountimbalances. German investors bought suchpaper for a net 321 billion. That was the
second-largest amount that Germans havepaid for such instruments since the introduc-tion of the euro. Greatest demand was forUS-dollar-denominated bonds, with Germaninvestors adding a record 318
1/C252billion worth
of these securities to their portfolios (com-pared with 311
1/C252billion a year earlier). In
addition, foreign money market instrumentswith an original maturity of one year or lessand worth 37 billion were also acquired.
Some investors thought that this paper had afavourable risk-return profile in view of thepossible increase in interest rates.
The same factors which had a positive impact
on the share markets, namely the favourableeconomic situation, the encouraging earningsoutlook and the advantageous conditions forcorporate financing, also fostered direct in-vestment worldwide in 2006. A 35% increaseto US$1 trillion in 2006 meant that the rise inglobal direct investment flows, according toinitial estimates by UNCTAD, was even great-er than in 2005 (29%). Even so, the total

30value was still below the record US$11/C252tril-
lion reached in 2000. However, the growth in
direct investment has to be seen against the
background of the sharp increase in M&A ac-
tivity. The global M&A volume expanded to
more than 32 trillion, with cross-border deals
accounting for about one-third of this sum.10
The cross-border transactions of multination-
als in which German investors have a stake
also rose rapidly in 2006 even if the increase,
at just under 12%, was smaller than its global
counterpart. This increase was reflected in
greater inward and outward foreign direct in-
vestment, which comprises not only corpor-
ate mergers but also all other cross-border fi-
nancial transactions of affiliated enterprises
(see the box on pages 32 and 33). All in all,
the result was net capital exports of 329 bil-
lion compared with 316 billion a year earlier.
German enterprises, in particular, extended
their presence abroad considerably in 2006.
They provided their foreign affiliates with
more funds ( 3631/C252billion) than they had
done for the previous six years (2005: 3441/C252
billion). The large volume of reinvested earn-
ings – in addition to the acquisition of partici-
pating interests already mentioned – contrib-
uted to this situation, which suggests that
their foreign branches and subsidiaries had
been generating excellent profits. The
amount invested abroad would actually have
been even greater if it had not been for con-
siderable reverse flows, that is to say, loans
granted by these affiliates to their parent
companies domiciled in Germany. As had
happened frequently in the past, intra-group
transactions with financing institutions in theNetherlands were the predominant factor in
this. The main host countries for German dir-
ect investment last year were the United
States ( 3151/C252billion), Malta ( 39 billion)11and
the United Kingdom ( 36 billion). A further 39
billion flowed into the EU countries in central
and eastern Europe and into Russia. The fact
that most of the capital was transferred to
other industrial countries suggests that the
purpose of acquiring participating interests
was to open up new markets. Tax and cost
considerations were no doubt also major in-
vestment incentives. These assumptions are
supported by looking at a breakdown by in-
vesting sector. Among the most active here
were credit institutions ( 3201/C252billion) and the
manufacturers of machinery and equipment
(38 billion). However, the manufacturers of
textiles and textile products ( 341/C252billion) and
the chemicals industry ( 34 billion) also built
up their presence abroad considerably.
Foreign enterprises invested 334 billion in
Germany last year compared with 329 billion
in 2005. A few sizeable corporate mergers
were important here and also affected the
breakdown by region and sector. For ex-
ample, the bulk of inward investment came
from other industrial countries, the greatest
amounts stemming from France ( 351/C252billion),
Denmark ( 35 billion) and the United States
(35 billion). Investors’ interest centred on the
banking and insurance sector ( 3111/C252billion)
and on holding companies ( 38 billion). How-
ever, substantial funds ( 37 billion) also flowed
into the chemicals industry, which was princi-

31pally the result of two acquisitions. A signifi-
cant portion of the investment made its wayto Germany via international financial centres(including Switzerland, Ireland and Bermuda),with the result that it was not always possibleto determine the regional provenance of theactual investors reliably.
As in the case of direct investment, other in-
vestment, which comprises loans and tradecredits as well as bank deposits and otherassets, recorded net capital exports in 2006(3115 billion) compared with outflows of
374
1/C252billion a year earlier. The non-
securitised credit transactions of non-banks,however, resulted in net inflows of funds ( 39
billion). This was due primarily to the oper-ations of enterprises and households ( 38 bil-
lion). They increased their – particularly long-term – cross-border liabilities from financialloans more sharply ( 327 billion) than their
(short-term) bank balances abroad ( 315 bil-
lion). The transactions by general governmentresulted in modest inflows of capital ( 31 bil-
lion net). However, there were shifts withingeneral government’s external assets. First, itreduced its long-term external assets ( 38 bil-
lion), a notable factor here being Russia’s re-payment of a debt incurred through the ParisClub; second, it increased its short-term bankbalances abroad ( 36
1/C252billion). Evidently for-
eign financial centres are still offering favour-able conditions for the investment of liquidfunds, and these terms are being exploitedboth by enterprises and general government.
Consequently, it was primarily the unsecuri-
tised credit transactions of the banking sys-tem (including the Bundesbank) with net cap-ital exports of 3124 billion that, along with
the aforementioned capital outflows throughdirect investment, formed the counterpart tothe large current account surplus. For ex-ample, Germany’s credit institutions last yearheavily expanded their lending to foreign cus-tomers. It was primarily interbank transac-tions that were involved here. The repatri-ation of business hitherto undertaken by Ger-man banks’ disbanded foreign affiliates alsoplayed a major role. All in all, German banks’net external assets rose by 3147 billion last
year. In the case of the Bundesbank, by con-trast, there were inflows of funds ( 323 billion
net). This is attributable mainly to a reductionin claims within the large-value payment sys-tem TARGET.
The reserve assets of the Bundesbank, trans-
action-related changes in which are includedin the financial account, declined by 33 billion
in 2006. In the process, there were reductionsin both the holdings of foreign exchange re-serves and the reserve position in the IMF (in-cluding SDRs). In the case of the foreign ex-change reserves it was the claims on foreigncredit institutions that fell in particular. Thedecline in the IMF position was due to repay-ments by European countries – notably Tur-key – of credits previously taken up at theIMF. By contrast, the reserve assets increasedin value – albeit less sharply, at 31
1/C252billion,
than in 2005 – owing to the usual revaluationat market prices. The rise in the price of goldmeant a 35 billion upward revaluation of the
gold holdings whereas the foreign exchangereserves, primarily as a result of the weaknessof the US dollar, lost 33

The Bun desbank colle cts data on cross- border dire ct invest-
ment on the basis of the Forei gn Tra de an d Payments A ct an d 
internationally approve d deﬁ nitions.1 In this context, new 
investments an d liqui dations of equity capital, re investe d 
earnin gs an d credit transa ctions between afﬁ  liate d enter-
prises are re corded an d shown separately. New investment 
comprises lon g-term investment amountin g to at least 10 % 
of the cap ital or the votin g rights. Thus, it in cludes not only 
cross- border mer gers an d acquisitions (M&As) between or 
of existin g enterprises but also – whi ch are currently in dis-
tin guisha ble – startups ( greenﬁ  eld investments).2
A separate analysis of cross- border M&As therefore still 
requires re course to data from private provi ders. Since 
these provi ders pursue different goals when compilin g the 
data an d thus use different criteria an d sour ces as a basis, 
some of their ﬁ  gures differ si gniﬁ cantly from the ofﬁ  cial 
ﬁ gures.3, 4 Nevertheless, these statisti cs can also offer import-
ant a dditional information a bout enterprises‘ equity a cqui-
sitions an d any risks resultin g from their ﬁ  nan cing.
Last year, the effe ctive mer gers an d acquisitions – calcu late d 
on the basis of ﬁ  gures from Thomson Finan cial SDC Plat-
inum – in crease d worl dwide by almost 30 % to some €2.2 
trillion. The German M&A market also re corded a further 
upturn in 200 6. Thus, the value of complete d transa ctions 
with German involvement rose by over 40 % to €130 billion 
(see a djacent chart). In this case, almost three-quarters of 
the volume was a ccounte d for by cross- border a cquisitions. 
Dire ct investment ﬂ  ows often develop analo gously to tra de 
ﬂ ows.5 This is consistent with earlier o bservations that the 
substantial expansion of German forei gn tra de last year 
also gave the German e conomy a more prominent role 
in inter national M&A a ctivity. Another fa ctor may have 
been that domesti c enterprises have internationally trans-fera ble competi tive a dvanta ges – su ch as an attra ctive 
pro duct ran ge, a goo d market position or te chni cal expert-

ors expan d ed their cross- border M&A involvement in 200 6

Conversely, Germany was also an important tar get coun-

The ﬁ  nan cing stru cture of M&As has chan ged signiﬁ cantly 
over the past few years. Generally, there are two ﬁ  nan cing 
options for M&As: the ex chan ge of shares or a cash offer. 
In the case of share swaps, the proprietors of the a cquire d 
enterprise are pai d in shares of the investin g enterprise, 
while in the case of a cash offer, they re ceive a cash pay-
ment. In the latter case, the a cquirin g enterprise can draw 
on availa ble liqui d fun ds or, as is often the case, it resorts 
– at least in part – to debt-ﬁ nan cing by means of loans or 
the issuan ce of bon ds. While durin g the “new e conomy” 
boom (in the years 1998 to 2001) the ex chan ge of shares was 
the pre dominant ﬁ  nan cing metho d worl dwide, a ccountin g 
for 57 %, most re cently 72 % of the ﬁ  nan cing volume was 
accounte d for by cash offers. One reason for this chan ge 
may be that, followin g the slump in share pri ces, shares 
have become less attra ctive as a “means of payment” for 
the sharehol ders of a cquire d enterprises. Moreover, the ris-
ing proﬁ  ta bil ity of enterprises in re cent years is likely to 
have fa cilitate d the a ccumulation of liqui d fun ds. In a dd-
ition, the debt ﬁ nan cing of a cquisitions has become espe-
cially attra ctive of late owin g to the low interest rates in 
the capital markets. It is noteworthy that, over the past ten 
years, the avera ge share of cash transa ctions in a cquisitions 
by German enterprises was 20 per centa ge points hi gher 
than the worl dwide avera ge.7
In ma croe conomi c terms, M&As can help to improve the 
allo cation of capital. Welfare gains can be expe cted from 
the realisation of cost a dvanta ges, more efﬁ  cient mana ge-
ment or the exploitation of e conomies of s cale. However, 
debt-ﬁ nan ced acquisitions, in parti cular levera ged buy-outs 
(LBOs), ie a cquisitions of esta blishe d enterprises or parts of 
them in whi ch a si gniﬁ cant part of the a cquisition cost is pai d for usin g borrowe d fun ds, can also pose pro blems to 
ﬁ nan cial sta bility, espe cially as there has been a sharp rise 
in the ﬁ  nan cing volume in this area in parti cular.8 The fa ct 
that the avera ge ratin g of LBO enterprises has ten ded to 
de teriorate – with possi ble ne gative impli cations for the 
previous creditors – shoul d be viewe d criti cally. Althou gh 
the sharp rise in the ratio of debt to operatin g proﬁ  t 
ob serve d in the re cent past can be seen as an attempt by 
invest ors to in crease their return on equity in times of low 
interest rates, it must not be for gotten that this coul d make 
enterprises in creasin gly vulnera ble in the event of risin g 
interest rates, for example. Even if banks pass on the loans 
relatin g to an LBO to other creditors, they may still in cur 
risks because, as un der writers, they may be expose d to a 
market shift durin g the hol ding perio d. They may also be 
vulnera ble to an in dire ct risk if the exposure arisin g from 
LBOs is assume d by he dge fun ds whi ch themselves are 
in debted to the banks.9

All in all, the statistically recorded net capital
exports exceeded the current account surplus
considerably. A balancing item therefore
arose last year, which, at 330 billion, was un-
usually high. A fairly large part of this can pre-
sumably be explained by cross-border cash
transactions that were not captured in thestatistics. For example, cash expenditure by
German residents on travel, where this is
transacted in euro, and capital outflows
through the transfer of euro banknotes by
German credit institutions or the Bundesbank
are each captured only once – with no corres-

intra-euro-area trade:
cyclical effects
and structural
determinantsIn the past year, the German economy
has increasingly been setting the pace
of economic activity in the euro area.
This stands in stark contrast to the pre-
ceding ten years. The marked gap in
growth during this period was not so
much the result of other economies
catching up economically or of the
stimuli generated by interest rate
convergence in some member states
during the run-up to monetary union.
Rather, the main reasons were mis-
aligned economic policies and struc-
tural failings; these led to a persistent
disruption of growth domestically and
were accompanied by losses of market
shares in the euro area.
It was only gradually and with much
effort that the German economy
worked itself out of this difficult situ-
ation. One crucial element of this suc-
cess story was wage policy in Germany
– a learning process that was set in mo-
tion by the locational and investment
problems of major industrial sectors
and the hard core of unemployment.
This process, along with enterprises’ re-
structuring efforts, played a major part
in the regaining of price competitive-
ness. In this market-friendly manner,
Germany’s intra-euro-area trade has
gone from having a stabilising func-
tion for the German economy to be-
coming more and more of a stimulus
for its euro-area partners.

36Germany’s intra-euro-area trade:
a retrospective view
Between the launch, at the beginning of
1999, of Stage Three of European economic
and monetary union (EMU) and 2006, Ger-
man intra-euro-area exports grew in real
terms by an annual average of 61/C254%.1Since
bottoming out in 1998, the share of German
intra-euro-area goods exports in the euro-
area partner countries’ total imports in-
creased by 21/C254percentage points to 19%.
This was still clearly below the reference
figure (221/C254%) in 1989, the year prior to
German reunification.
This provides a framework in which to view
German economy’s export successes. Further-
more, German enterprises’ real exports to
their euro-area partners grew less sharply
than their exports to non-euro-area countries,
which went up by 71/C252% per year since 1999.
This was due mainly to the fact that the ex-
port markets in non-euro-area countries as a
whole grew more sharply (+73/C254% per year)
than demand within the euro area (+5% per
year). In the period from 1999 to 2006, the
euro-area partner countries’ exports of goods
to non-euro-area countries, with an overall
increase in volume of 44%, lagged consider-
ably behind the German figure of 743/C254%. As
a result, in the same period Germany’s share
of the volume of goods exported by euro-
area countries to non-euro-area countries
went up 41/C252percentage points to 371/C254%.At 2000 prices

37At constant prices, Germany’s imports of
goods and services from its euro-area part-ners since the beginning of Stage Three ofEMU grew by a total of 3
1/C252% annually, and,
therefore, considerably more slowly than ex-ports.
2Especially in the 2001-2005 period,
German imports showed only slight growth.In 2002, they even fell. It was not until 2006that demand for euro-area imports rebound-ed, achieving, at +9
1/C252%, its fastest rate of
growth since 1991. In the 1999-2006 period,however, the total volume of Germany’seuro-area partners’ intra-euro-area importsrose considerably more sharply than Germanintra-euro-area imports; Germany’s share fellfrom 25% in 1998 to 23% in 2002. Thetrend was subsequently pointing upwardsslightly until 2005. In 2006, however, the fig-ure shot up by almost 1 percentage point to24
1/C254%.
The buoyant growth of German real exports
since 1999, with a concurrent subdued in-crease in imports, led to a significant rise inreal net exports (goods and services). The bal-ance of trade with the euro-area partnerswas transformed from a 36
1/C254billion deficit in
1998 to a surplus of 3641/C252billion in 2005. In
2006, the balance fell by a marginal 33/C254bil-
lion. In terms of value, the balance did not in-crease quite so sharply, ie from + 33
1/C254billion
to +3613/C254billion. Germany was able to rack
up large surpluses with, in particular, France,Spain, Italy, Belgium and Austria. Owing tothe relatively moderate development of Ger-man export prices since 1998, the terms oftrade between Germany and its euro-areatrading partners – calculated on the basis ofthe export and import price indices – has
fallen by 7%.
In real terms, the balance of trade in goods
and services with non-euro-area countries inthe past eight years has grown more or less inline with intra-euro-area trade – ie from - 35
billion to 364
1/C252billion – although the increase
was smaller in terms of value. There was amarked growth in the nominal surpluses intrade in goods and services with the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom, while thebilateral deficit with China continued to in-crease perceptibly.

38ance of trade with the OPEC countries and
Russia has deteriorated only slightly in the
past few years since German exporters have
benefited considerably from the dynamic
growth in demand from these countries,
which was driven by higher oil revenues. The
higher cost of imports of crude oil and other
raw materials has been accompanied since
2004 by a noticeable (71/C252%) worsening of
the terms of trade with non-euro-area coun-
tries.
The high level of German net exports to its
euro-area partners and non-euro-area coun-
tries form the core of the substantial current
account surplus, which amounted to 5% of
nominal GDP in 2006. In this connection,
Germany has been called upon from various
quarters to reduce its large surplus in order to
contribute to the resolution of global external
imbalances.3Apart from the open question
of how to implement this objective in eco-
nomic policy terms, it is often overlooked that
the euro area (including the German surplus)
has a current account deficit with the rest of
the world of1/C254% of euro-area GDP . The euro
area as a whole can therefore scarcely have
made a contribution to the global imbal-
ances.

39German surplus position, can be viewed in
the proper context only against the backdropof macroeconomic developments in the1990s following German reunification. Sincethe end of the 1990s, German exporters havedone no more than regain some of theground – both in euro-area sales markets andin extra-euro-area trade – that had been“lost” at the beginning of that decade as aresult of reunification. The rapid growth indomestic demand between 1990 and 1992,much of which was due to monetary unionwith the former GDR and the major pent-updesire for goods among the general public ineastern Germany, led many German enter-prises – given the high level of capacity utili-sation – to give preference to servicing thedomestic market. Simultaneously, imports inthat three-year period grew by as much as31
1/C254%.
The mere fact that the goods surplus declined
from DM 141 billion in 1989 to DM 311/C252bil-
lion in 1991 and did not peak again until1998-99 is evidence enough of how stronglythe economic consequences of reunificationshaped Germany’s foreign trade. In 1990 and1991, the pull of imports from Germany, to-gether with moderate export growth, clearlysupported overall economic activity or coun-teracted the economic downturn that was al-ready under way in the other EU countries.
4
The positive demand impulses from Germanywere, however, accompanied by potential re-tarding effects since rising interest rates inGermany, deemed appropriate in the contextof stability policy, also impacted on the otherEMS countries.This import pull caused by unification was
joined by a substantial deterioration in theGerman economy’s price competitivenessdue, first of all, to overly generous pay agree-ments in western Germany and the rushedadjustment of wages in the eastern part ofthe country. National unit labour costs in1995 were 13% higher than in 1991 (datafor Germany as a whole do not go back fur-ther). The sharp appreciation of the D-Markduring this period was an additional factor.The indicator of price competitiveness (calcu-lated by comparison with 19 industrial coun-tries based on the deflators of total sales)shows a 12
1/C252% deterioration in the 1989-
1995 period. The losses against non-EU coun-tries were, in fact, even somewhat largerthan against the later euro-area partners.
Furthermore, German domestic economic ac-
tivity was increasingly affected by the severefiscal strains arising from unification, whichwere due mainly to the sudden sharp increasein government borrowing and the acute pro-cess of adjustment in the construction indus-try which began in 1995.
5The result was a
marked slowdown in growth in the mid-1990s, which persisted – with a brief inter-ruption due to the New Economy boom in1999 and 2000 – until the middle of this dec-ade. This was accompanied by a considerable

40reduction in employment and a matching rise
in unemployment, which resulted in a dra-
matic deterioration in public finances.
In the specific situation in which Germany
found itself in the mid-1990s, not very many
effective possibilities of reversing this devel-
opment or parameters for adjustment were,
in fact, available. One obvious option was to
address the increasingly difficult labour mar-
ket situation by means of sustained and far-
reaching wage restraint6and to restore Ger-
many’s since diminished attractiveness as a
location for production and investment. An-
other avenue was offered by the opening of
the Iron Curtain, which provided German in-
dustry with an opportunity to lower costs on
a substantial scale by shifting production to
the transition countries in central and easternEurope. This process accelerated still further
in the latter part of the 1990s and early part
of this decade when the accession of the
most of the neighbouring transition countries
to the EU and, therefore, the convergence of
legal systems with west European standards
took on ever firmer shape.
In the run-up to the beginning of Stage Three
of European monetary union on 1 January
1999, the German economy was confronted
with new challenges. With the D-Mark as
one of the most stable currencies and low risk
premiums in the interest rate to match, enter-
prises enjoyed relatively low capital costs well
into the 1990s. The rapid convergence of
nominal interest rates in the partner countries
towards the lower German level lessened the
German economy’s comparative financing
advantages. Calculated on the basis of na-
tional consumer prices, Germany very soon
found itself in the uncomfortable position of
having the highest real interest rates among
the euro-area countries. This may have, at
times, been one factor among several others
contributing to Germany’s relative and abso-
lute weak economic growth, although it
should not be viewed in isolation.7Average since 1975 = 100,

6Between 1992 and 1997, the number of persons in
work declined by 3% and the number of unemployed
went up by 1.8 million to 4.4 million. In 1997, the un-
employment rate reached a new peak at 11.4%. This
made Germany one of the countries in the euro area
with the greatest labour market problems.
7The ex post real interest rate, which is calculated on the
basis of the actual rates of inflation and is often used as
an argument in this context, is hardly relevant to enter-
prises’ investment decisions. Rather, these decisions are
based on the ex ante real interest rate, ie the nominal
interest rate adjusted for inflation expectations. During
this period, the national differences in inflation expect-
ations were, however, significantly smaller than the
differentials in actual interest rates. Moreover, long-term
inflation expectations are converging in the euro area.Improvement

41This is because the retarding effects via the
real interest channel were counteracted by
more moderate price developments than in
most other euro-area countries, which grad-
ually led to an improvement in Germany’s
competitive position within the euro area.
Through this “competition channel”, German
exports to neighbouring countries were
boosted and domestic suppliers’ position in
the German market was strengthened.8Be-
tween the start of Stage Three of EMU and
the end of 2006, the indicator of price com-
petitiveness improved by 111/C254%, and has in-
creased by as much as one-fifth since bot-
toming out in the second quarter of 1995.
A key part in this was played by marked
wage restraint, to which – given the high
level of unemployment – the German econ-
omy ultimately had no alternative.
Price competitiveness vis-/C224-vis non-euro-area
countries, however, has been shaped to a
marked extent by the euro’s exchange rate. In
1999 and 2000, German exporters benefited
from the sharp depreciation of the euro
against the currencies of major trading part-
ners, especially the US dollar. In the years that
followed, the euro was clearly trending back
up. The indicator of price competitiveness
vis-/C224-vis non-euro-area countries deteriorated
by almost one-fifth during this six-year
period. Its value therefore roughly corres-
ponded to its long-run average. In the mid-
1990s, price competitiveness had been much
worse.9The significance of foreign trade for
growth in Germany since 1999
In mathematical terms, the sharp 801/C254%
growth of real exports (as defined in the na-
tional accounts) since 1999 added 211/C252per-
centage points to the increase in total value
added. At constant prices, imports rose by
59% during the same period. Viewed in the
categories of the national accounts, this re-
sulted in a calculative reduction in GDP
growth of 151/C254percentage points. On bal-
ance, net exports thus made a 61/C254percentage
point contribution to growth, with total value
added rising by 111/C252%.
Breaking down exports and imports of goods
and services by euro-area and non-euro-area
countries produces the following picture: real
exports to euro-area countries provided a
cumulative contribution to growth of 73/C254per-
centage points in the period from 1999 to
2006. Exports to non-euro-area countries
generated an increase in GDP of 133/C254per-
centage points. Accordingly, imports from
other euro-area countries had negative
cumulative growth effects amounting to
41/C252percentage points, and exports from non-
euro-area countries had negative cumulative
8See also European Economic Advisory Group at CESifo,
Report on the European Economy, February 2007, p 21 f.
9In this context, it should be noted that the development
of German exports and of imports is determined in the
longer run more by the growth of export markets and/or
domestic demand than by relative prices. However, price
competitiveness is more important in trade with euro-
area partner countries than in non-euro-area markets.

42growth effects of 103/C254percentage points.
This means that, in terms of the balance, net
exports to the euro area and to non-euro-
area countries contributed 31/C254and 3 percent-
age points respectively to growth throughout
the reporting period.
The somewhat higher contribution of intra-
trade to growth is due to real net exports to
the euro area having risen continuously since
1999, whereas net exports to non-euro-area
countries shrank in 2002 and 2003, not least
owing to the appreciation of the euro. In add-
ition, net exports in trade with euro-area
partner countries rose more sharply in 2004
and 2005 than in trade with non-euro-area
countries. In 2006, however, net exports in
intra-trade fell marginally, whereas extra-
trade recorded a considerable rise in net ex-
ports. During the 2002-2005 period, which
was a difficult one for the German economy,
real net exports contributed 3 percentage
points to growth, of which two percentage
points were attributable to trade in goods
with euro-area countries and 1 percentage
point to trade in goods with non-euro-area
countries. During this time, GDP rose by no
more than a total of 2%, and domestic
demand fell by 1%.
Exports and imports are becoming ever more
closely interconnected, even though real
growth in German imports was, on the
whole, mostly lagging well behind real
growth in exports in the years following the
launch of the Stage Three of monetary union
in 1999. The reason for this is that the import
content of German goods exports rose by
nearly 10 percentage points in the secondhalf of the 1990s and had shown a further
slight rise to just under 42% by 2005. The
success of the German economy’s exports has
thus also been reflected in a corresponding
increase in demand for imported goods.
There are indications here that imports from
the euro area and those from non-euro-area
countries are nearly equivalent in terms of
their significance for the production of export
goods in Germany. An ECB study for the year
2000, for example, puts the relevant percent-
age of imports from the (pre-enlargement)
EU at 221/C252% and that of imports from the
rest of the world at 201/C252%.10The ratio for
the euro area is likely to have been slightly
lower than that given for the EU because the
former contains a smaller group of countries.
Simulations to estimate the growth effects of
export-induced German imports find that,
given an average import content of 40%
since 2004, around 45% of German imports
are attributable to exports. In order to study
how far the other euro-area countries have
been involved in the sharp rise in German ex-
ports via this channel, a simulation was used
in which the level of German imports was re-
duced by precisely the same export-induced
percentage. In this context, the assumption
was that of a sustained fall in German de-
mand for foreign goods and services to a
level 45% lower than the baseline – the ac-
tual level of imports. In the first year,3/C254per-
centage point lower growth is then shown
for the other euro-area countries taken as a
whole. In the second year, the contractionary

43effect is still at just under1/C252percentage point.
These results should, however, be interpretedwith caution since, in the simulation, theother external variables (commodity prices,interest rates within the euro area, exchangerates and all variables for non-euro-areacountries) remain exogenous. The figuresstated here therefore comprise only direct ef-fects. Real economic effects and price-relatedspill-over effects produced by foreign tradelinks within the euro area are thus not takeninto consideration.
German exports to euro-area partner coun-
tries having a marked growth lead over im-ports is already implied by the fact that somecountries have been on a steeper growthpath than the German economy over thepast few years. One reason for this is thatsome countries’ economies are still in a theprocess of catching up. Other factors to betaken into account are the rapid process ofinterest rate convergence prior to monetaryunion and the increasing financial market in-tegration in the euro area, which has pro-vided considerable benefits to the formerhigh-interest countries.
11Moreover, econom-
ic growth in Germany was adversely affectedin the 1990s by the well-known exceptionalstrains and undesirable developments – notleast in the wake of reunification. The upshotof all of this was that the German economyhad mostly been at the bottom of the euro-area growth table since the mid-1990s.
Another major factor behind the diverging
trends of exports and imports in intra-euro-area trade was wage moderation in Germany.First, through improving domestic suppliers’price competitiveness, it stimulated exports
and tended to reduce import substitution.Second, owing to the small rises in income,overall consumption demand was initiallydampened and, owing to the matching weakincrease in tax revenues and social securitycontributions, the pressure to consolidatepublic sector budgets mounted. Over the1999-2006 period as a whole, compensationper employee in the euro area, excluding Ger-many, rose 13
3/C254% more sharply than in Ger-
many. Owing to the weaker rise in labourproductivity, unit wage costs rose even morequickly by 16
1/C252%. The shifts in competitive-
ness in the euro area therefore reflect the factthat, in some member states, general wagePercent-

44developments tracked productivity growth
only to a limited degree. Measured in those
terms, the cumulative differential consumer
price inflation, at 7% in 2006, was still rela-
tively moderate.
Using the Bundesbank’s econometric model,
an attempt was made to estimate the influ-
ence of wage moderation on foreign trade
through real depreciation and the retardingeffect on import demand. Improved competi-
tiveness through the transfer of production to
lower-cost reform countries and emerging
market economies was disregarded.12In the
simulation, it was assumed that gross wages
and salaries per employee had risen by 21/C252%
on average in the period since 1999 and not
by just over 1%, which was actually the case.
That would have made employee compensa-
tion in 2006 91/C254% higher. Real imports would
have exceeded their actual value by 31/C252%
and exports by3/C254%. This means that the
cumulative contribution of foreign trade to
growth would have been noticeably lower
(11/C254percentage points); however, because of
the much stronger private final demand from
residents, real GDP would have surpassed the
actual figure by as much as just over1/C252%.
The price to be paid on the labour market,
however, would have been quite high; the
number of employed persons in 2006 would
have been 13/C254% below the base line. Over
the longer term, in particular, the sustained
loss of price competitiveness for the German
economy and, ultimately, also for the euro-
area would have had even more severe nega-
tive growth implications. Moreover, the inev-
itable need for adjustment in the long run
and the pressure for reform would have be-
come even greater.
This view was confirmed by developments in
the economy in the past year. Accordingly,
the debate on how far economic activity in
the neighbouring countries has been ham-1998 = 100, annual averages, log scale

45pered by Germany’s weak economic growth,
especially in the 2001-2005 period, and its in-
creasing competitiveness over the past few
years, has now become considerably less im-
portant.13In 2006, German imports of goods
and services from the rest of the euro area
rose at a real rate of 91/C252%. This was the first
time in some while that they had increased
more strongly than exports (+71/C252%). The re-
sult was a slight decline in net exports. This
means that Germany’s neighbours benefited
significantly last year from the renewed more
buoyant economic activity in Germany. For
the euro area as a whole, it will also be a
long-term advantage that Germany, as its
largest economy, has recovered its footing,
and that the current upswing still offers a
continuing positive outlook, not least owing
to the success achieved in consolidation and
restructuring.14In 2006, this already played a
major part in effecting a noticeable reduction
in growth differentials between the euro area
and the other major industrial countries, es-
pecially the USA.
Conclusions
On the whole, the considerable improvement
in economic growth in Germany has shown
that wage policy moderation – combined
with greater international diversification of
production and the labour market reformsthat have been introduced – has been a suc-
cess. At the same time, this means that, for
euro-area member states that need to restore
their price competitiveness and enhance their
attractiveness as a location for production
and investment, there is no sustainable or ef-
fective alternative to the path embarked
upon by Germany. This insight is now also
gaining increasingly widespread support in
academic discourse.15
Seen in this light, Germany is, therefore, a
classic example of how market-related adjust-
ments can operate and be effective under the
rules of a monetary union. From the lengthy
and arduous adjustment process in Germany
since the mid-1990s, it may also be con-
cluded that unwelcome developments in
wage policy are extremely difficult to correct
retrospectively. Furthermore, such correc-
tions, in a relatively large and very open econ-
omy such as Germany’s, will inevitably also
extend well into the external sector.
