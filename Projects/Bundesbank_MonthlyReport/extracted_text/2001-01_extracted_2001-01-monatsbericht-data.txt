EconomyasawholeAccording to initial calculations by the Federal
Statistical Office, overall economic output in-creased by 3.1% in 2000. Taking into accountthe lower number of working days last year,real gross domestic product (GDP) rose, infact, by 3.3%. That was the strongest eco-nomic growth recorded since German unifi-cation. Capacity utilisation in the economy asa whole went up on average by more than1 percentage point. Strong stimuli to growthwere generated, in particular, by buoyant ex-port activity, which benefited from the sharpexpansion in world trade as well as a high de-gree of price competitiveness. Although do-mestic demand tended to be subdued overall,investment in machinery and equipment re-vealed a positive trend with a rise of 9% inreal terms. Against this, there was a decline inconstruction work (– 2.5%). The depressedlevel of consumption reflects, not least, theabsorption of purchasing power due to thedramatic increase in oil prices.
Manufacturing
Economic activity in manufacturing slowed
down in autumn 2000. Seasonally adjustedoutput in October had already been down onthe previous months and did not increase inNovember either. Taken together, these twoautumn months were almost 1% down onthe average level of the third quarter. Theyear-on-year increase in output, which in thesummer quarter had amounted to 7

6clined to just under 6%. Although the provi-
sional figures for November are likely to be re-vised upwards, this will not fundamentallyalter the trend of the past few months.
In November 2000 seasonally adjusted orders
received in manufacturing were somewhatdown on the previous month. However, sincethey had been quite sizeable in early autumn,the flow of orders in October and Novemberexpanded by roughly
1p8TG2% compared with
the third quarter. New orders were 71p8TG4%u p
on the year, against somewhat more than9% in summer.
The diverging developments between output
and orders is due to a number of major con-tracts which were not immediately reflectedin output. Initially, they were put on the orderbooks, and are securing future output.
As had been the case for some time, many
orders were again placed by foreign custom-ers in the period under review. Seasonally ad-justed, in October and November they ex-ceeded the level of the third quarter by1
1p8TG2%. Compared with the previous year,
they rose by just over 14%, which was al-most as much as before. By contrast, domes-tic demand in these two autumn months re-mained at the same level as in summer; theyear-on-year increase declined to roughly2
1p8TG2%, having been 51p8TG2% in the three-
month period of July to September.

7in seasonally adjusted terms, the year-on-year
fall, at 111p8TG4%, was scarcely less than in the
summer months. While public sector con-tractors commissioned more constructionprojects at the start of autumn in seasonallyadjusted terms, there was a further decline inorders for residential construction.
Seasonally adjusted construction output – for
which data are already available up to No-vember – was significantly higher in thatmonth than in October. In year-on-yearterms, too, where there had been a shortfallof as much as 5
1p8TG2% in early autumn, the fig-
ure was now only slightly down on the com-parable period in 1999. This is hardly a sign ofa cyclical upturn, however. Instead, this com-paratively favourable outcome is mainly dueto the mild weather conditions which – as isalso indicated by the surveys of the ifo insti-tute – hampered construction work less thanusual.
LabourmarketThe situation on the labour market continued
to improve at the end of 2000. According tothe calculations of the Federal Statistical Of-fice, the seasonally adjusted number of per-sons in employment rose to 38.65 million inOctober, which was 75,000 more than in thethird quarter and 575,000, or 1.5%, morethan in the same period in 1999. This meansthat employment has continued to rise at abroadly unchanged pace. Additional staffwere employed not only in the services sectorbut also in manufacturing. In construction, bycontrast, redundancies probably predomin-ated up to the end of the period under review.Owing to the high demand for labour, un-
employment also declined significantly. Up toDecember 2000 the number of persons regis-tered at the Federal Labour Office fell to 3.77million in seasonally adjusted terms, whichwas 240,000 fewer than 12 months previ-ously. The seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate went down to 9.2%.
However, the improvement in the labour mar-
ket situation was largely confined to westernGermany, where the seasonally adjusted un-employment rate had fallen to 7.3% by theend of December – which was markedly lessthan the average annual level of 7.8%. Ineastern Germany, however, the rate, even atthe end of the year, was scarcely lower thanon an average of 2000 (17.4%).
PricesFor the first time in some while, price develop-
ments became calmer at the end of 2000.The year-on-year increase in the consumerprice index fell back to 2.2% in December,down from 2.4% in the two previous months.This was mainly due to lower prices for refinedpetroleum products. These reductions were sosharp that energy became markedly cheaperoverall, even though gas and contributions toheating costs became more expensive again.Excluding energy, the year-on-year rate of in-crease for other goods, services and houserents remained at roughly 1%.
The harmonised consumer price index (HICP)
used by the ECB showed a year-on-year in-crease of 2.3% in December, compared with2.6% in November.

8German consumer prices for heating oil and
petrol responded rapidly to the noticeablecalming of prices on the international oil mar-kets. At the end of December a barrel ofBrent North Sea Oil cost only US$ 23. Therewas a slight price increase again at the begin-ning of 2001 but, at around US$ 26 at theend of the period under review, this was along way from matching the peaks of mid-November, when a price of US$ 35 had beenrecorded for a time.
For German import prices, only data up to
November are available at present. In thatmonth there had been a further noticeablemonth-on-month rise in seasonally adjustedterms. Even so, the year-on-year rate of in-crease went down from +13.4% to +12.5%,since the upward pressure on prices had beeneven stronger in the same period of 1999.
German industrial selling prices likewise con-
tinued to rise in November, and the year-on-year rate of growth went up slightly to 4.7%.In particular, prices for gas and district heat-ing went up again owing to the time lag intheir response to oil prices. Excluding energy,the year-on-year rate of inflation amountedto 2.2%.
Publicfinance
FederalcashtrendsIn December the Federal Government record-
ed a cash surplus of 39
1p8TG2billion. For the
same month last year, it had posted an evenlarger surplus of 314
1p8TG2billion, which wasmainly the result of abundant privatisation
proceeds. In 2000 as a whole, the Federalcash deficit amounted to no more than 32
1p8TG2
billion, compared with 330 billion in 1999.
Receipts from the sale of mobile-phonelicences, which are not shown in budgetaccount entries but part of which were re-flected in cash transactions, were the primereason for this significant improvement in theFederal Government cash balance.
According to preliminary figures recently
made available, the Federal Government2000 deficit in the budgetary definitionamounted to not quite 324 billion, compared
with slightly more than 326 billion the year
before. This represents an improvement of31
1p8TG2billion over the deficit target for 2000,
which is attributable to receipts exceedingthe corresponding budget estimates by justover 31 billion and expenditure falling 3
1p8TG2
billion behind the appropriated sum. It was
mainly lower labour-market related spendingand interest payments which enabled theFederal Government to more than compen-sate for additional expenditure totallingaround 34
1p8TG2billion; the latter consisted
largely of indemnification payments to for-mer forced and slave labourers but also in-cluded, among other items, the subsidies forheating costs approved at the end of lastyear.
With effect from the end of the financial year
2000, the running commentary on Federalcash trends which has appeared here will bediscontinued, since cash data have becomeless and less reliable as a leading indicator oftrends in Federal finance owing to sizeableInternationaloil

9fluctuations during the year and increasingly
large deviations from budget figures. The dis-continuation of commentary on Federal cashtrends is also justified in view of the fact thatthe Federal Ministry of Finance has consider-ably extended and updated its own reportingon monthly Federal budget developments. Infuture, therefore, the “Public finance” sec-tion of the Commentaries will focus on themost recent data for Federal Governmentdebt, placing a stronger emphasis on grossfigures than hitherto. This is likely to servefinancial markets’ need for information bet-ter. The Bundesbank will also continue to re-port on net borrowing by regional and localauthorities as well as special funds.
PublicsectorborrowingIn November the aggregate debt of the cen-
tral, regional and local authorities rose by34
1p8TG2billion, with trends differing largely
among the individual levels of government.The Federal Government reduced its liabilitiesby a total of 31
3p8TG4billion. In doing so, it cut its
outstanding money market loans by as muchas32
1p8TG2billion, while taking up capital mar-
ket funds to the amount of 33p8TG4billion net.
Borrowing in the capital market mainly tookthe form of Federal bonds (Bunds), with a net
sales value of not quite 33 billion, while the
amount of Federal savings bonds outstandingfell significantly. At 36 billion, Lp8TTCnder Gov-
ernment net borrowing was very high, owingto the fact that the traditional Christmasbonuses paid to regional authority staff inNovember led to an urgent demand forfunds. The Lp8TTCnder Governments procured therequired funds primarily through short-termFederalfinanceonacashbasis*

10cash advances by banks. The local authorities
are likely to have stepped up their debt onlymarginally.
Gross capital market borrowing by the Fed-
eral Government amounted to just over 313
billion in December. Federal Treasury notes(36
3p8TG4billion) and Bunds (351p8TG2billion) ac-
counted for most of this large amount. Newborrowing, net of redemptions, which werethemselves quite sizeable, amounted to 31
3p8TG4
billion. The Federal Government cut its
money market debt by slightly more than 310
billion, leaving only a minor residual amountoutstanding. It also increased its money mar-ket deposits by an additional 31 billion for a
total of 31
1p8TG2billion.In 2000 as a whole, Federal Government
debt scarcely increased further, owing to thelarge amount of exceptional receipts from theUMTS licence sale.
1At the end of December
2000, Federal Government debt totalled3715
1p8TG2billion, compared with 3714 billion
one year earlier. There were marked shifts,however, among the different debt instru-ments. Thus, the amount of Bunds outstand-
ing rose by 320
1p8TG2billion, whereas the vol-
ume of short-term securities outstanding re-mained virtually unchanged. At the sametime, the Federal Government’s net redemp-tions primarily involved loans against borrow-ers’ notes and, less importantly, Federal sav-ings bonds. The Federal Government also cutits money market debt sharply (by 35
1p8TG2bil-
lion).

11ing declined by 35.8 billion net. Only shorter-
term paper (with maturities of up to and in-cluding four years) was affected by the net re-demptions. Foreign bonds were placed in theGerman market to the value of 38.3 billion
net. Net sales of domestic and foreign bondsyielded a total of 32.5 billion in November,
which was markedly less than a month before(325.6 billion).
Credit institutions redeemed their own bonds
to the extent of 35.7 billion (net), and thus
contributed substantially to the decline in theoutstanding amount of domestic bonds. Spe-cifically, communal bonds (/C214ffentliche Pfand-
briefe) and bonds issued by specialised credit
institutions were repurchased to the tune of33.6 billion net and 33.2 billion net, respect-
ively, while mortgage bonds (Hypotheken-
pfandbriefe) and other bank bonds were is-
sued to the extent of 30.9 billion net and
30.3 billion net, respectively. In November,
industrial bonds amounting to 30.3 billion
were sold.
In November, the outstanding amount of
bonds issued by the public sector diminishedby30.4 billion, mainly owing to net redemp-
tions by the Federal Government totalling30.8 billion. That authority repurchased
Federal savings bonds amounting to 32.1 bil-
lion (net). By contrast, five-year special Fed-eral bonds and ten-year Federal bonds weresold to the extent of 31.8 billion net and
31.2 billion net, respectively. The outstanding
amount of 30-year Federal bonds likewise in-creased (by 30.6 billion), while the outstand-
ing amount of Federal Treasury notes re-mained unchanged.
3On balance, the Lp8TTCnder
Governments sold bonds worth 30.6 billion.
In the market for Deutsche Mark/euro bonds
issued by non-residents under the lead-management of a German syndicate, theissue volume in November, at 32.2 billion,
was larger than a month before ( 30.3 bil-
lion). After deduction of the higher level ofredemptions (compared with the previousmonth), the outstanding amount declined by31.8 billion.Salesandpurchasesofbonds*

12On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mestic credit istitutions were in the forefrontin November. They enlarged their bond port-folios by 38.4 billion, 35.4 billion of this sum
being accounted for by foreign paper and33.0 billion by domestic securities. Domestic
non-banks reduced their holdings of bondsand notes by 30.2 billion. Domestic bonds
issued by private individuals were sold to thetune of 31.9 billion and public sector bonds
to the tune of 31.2 billion. Bonds issued by
non-residents were bought in the amount of32.9 billion net. In November, foreign invest-
ors sold German bonds to the total of 35.6
billion net.
EquitymarketIn November, domestic enterprises placed
new shares in the German equity market tothe market value of 31.6 billion, just as much
as a month before. Foreign equities were soldto the value of 311.7 billion. Altogether,
therefore, sales of shares amounted to 313.3
billion.
In November, foreign investors bought shares
worth 35.1 billion net. On balance, domestic
non-banks sold domestic paper worth 34.6
billion, while they purchased foreign sharesamounting to 311.8 billion net. Overall, they
thus purchased equities worth 37.1 billion.
Domestic credit institutions bought shares to-talling 31.1 billion.
InvestmentfundcertificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds came to 34.1 billion in November,compared with 35.9 billion in October. On
balance, funds open to the general publicsold certificates to the value of 33.3 billion.
As in the previous months, the greater part ofthat sum, at 32.7 billion, accrued to share-
based funds. Mixed funds and pension invest-ment mutual funds (Altersvorsorgefonds) re-
ceived 30.4 billion and 30.1 billion, respect-
ively. The outstanding amounts of certificatesof bond-based funds and money-marketfunds, by contrast, declined by 30.3 billion
and 30.2 billion, respectively. Open-end real-
estate funds had to repurchase certificates tothe extent of 30.1 billion net. 30.8 billion
net was invested in specialised funds. In No-vember, foreign fund certificates amountingto33.2 billion were sold in the German mar-
ket.
The investment fund certificates were mostly
bought by residents ( 36.9 billion). Non-banks
increased their portfolios of domestic and for-eign fund certificates by 32.7 billion and
33.1 billion, respectively. Altogether, they
purchased investment fund certificates worth35.8 billion. Credit institutions invested 31.1
billion in investment funds, with domesticfunds predominating ( 31.0 billion). Non-
residents bought domestic fund certificatesto the value of 30.4 billion.

13the significant decline in the trade surplus,
which had been unusually large in October.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, the trade surplus amounted to34.4 billion in November compared with
36.3 billion in October. Even after seasonal
factors have been eliminated, there was still afall in the trade surplus (from 35.5 billion in
October to 32.6 billion in November). The
main contributory factor here was a declinein the export of goods. These fell by a season-ally adjusted 2.4% in November comparedwith the previous month when, at 7.6%,they had risen unusually steeply. If Octoberand November are taken together, there wasan increase in seasonally adjusted terms of5.5% over the previous two-month period.The value of imported goods went up by3.2% in November compared with themonth before. In a two-month comparisonthe seasonally adjusted increase over the pre-vious period likewise amounted to 5.5%.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents rose from 36.8 billion in
October to 37.4 billion in November. Net fac-
tor income, which is subject to considerablemonthly fluctuations, fell particularly sharplyin November; the surplus of 30.5 billion in
October was followed in November by adeficit of 31.5 billion. By contrast, the deficit
on service transactions with non-residentsdeclined from 34.3 billion in October to
33.1 billion in November, essentially for sea-
sonal reasons. Current transfers to and fromnon-residents remained virtually unchanged(32.8 billion net).Majoritemsofthebalance

14Once again, there were net outflows of funds
as a result of both securities transactions anddirect investment in November whereas credittransactions produced net inflows. Net capitalexports from portfolio investment aloneamounted to 317.8 billion in November com-
pared with 36.1 billion in the previous
month. This development is due principally tothe increase in foreign investment by Germanresidents, who in the period under reviewpurchased foreign securities worth 317.5 bil-
lion, which was approximately 34 billion
more than in October. Most demand was forforeign bonds and notes ( 37.4 billion), shares
(36.0 billion) and investment certificates
(33.2 billion). By contrast, foreign investment
on the German market declined on balance(minus 30.3 billion). Although non-resident
investors acquired inter alia German shares
worth 35.0 billion and bonds and notes
worth 32.3 billion, they resold German
money market paper worth 38.0 billion at
the same time.
Net capital exports through direct investment
rose slightly to 35.2 billion in November com-pared with 34.6 billion in the month before.
Whereas foreign owners did not provide theirsubsidiaries in Germany with large additionalfunds (only 31.6 billion net), German enter-
prises invested fairly heavily abroad ( 36.8
billion).
Inflows of funds amounting to 33.2 billion
net accrued to enterprises and individuals asa result of non-securitised credit transactionsby non-banks. This was essentially due totheir drawing on balances held with foreignbanks. General government also imported alimited amount of funds ( 30.4 billion), mainly
as a result of borrowing. The credit transac-tions of the banking system, most of whichcan be seen as a reflection of all other pay-ments abroad, resulted in net capital importsin November. Net inflows accrued to both theBundesbank ( 34.5 billion) – mainly in con-
nection with the payment system TARGET –and the credit institutions ( 32.2 billion).

15Recent institutional
developments ineconomic andmonetarycooperationEconomic and monetary cooperation
relies on what has become a very ex-tensive network ofinternational andEuropean organisations and bodies.The Bundesbank plays an importantrole within the context ofthis institu-tionalised cooperation. Over the years,its special publications have thereforecontributed to encouraging as muchtransparency as possible in the tasksand activities ofimportant organisa-tions and bodies in which it partici-pates directly or which are ofparticularinterest to it. Recently, the number ofimportant international and Europeanbodies which are relevant to the Bun-desbank has increased further. At aglobal level the Financial StabilityForum and the Group ofTwenty arethe main new developments. In Eur-ope, the Eurogroup ofeconomics andfinance ministers was formed in thewake ofEuropean Monetary Union.Furthermore, several committees havebeen set up to act as coordinating in-struments within the European SystemofCentral Banks. The International Re-lations Committee plays a special rolehere because it mainly addresses inter-national issues, thus representing onestage in the process ofglobal co-operation. To supplement the Bundes-bank’s special publications on inter-national organisations and bodies, thisarticle describes the aforementionedrecent developments in detail.

16An overview ofthe current institutional
framework
Since the Second World War there has been
an unexpected intensification of economicand monetary cooperation. Taking the worldeconomy as a whole, there are today fiveglobal international organisations which canbe seen as the most important vehicles forthis cooperation. The International MonetaryFund (IMF) is responsible for the stability ofthe international monetary system. It has pri-marily a disciplinary influence on the econom-icpolic y of its members and is able to grantconditional emergency credit in the case ofbalance of payments difficulties. The WorldBank Group provides financial and technicalsupport as a means of encouraging the pro-cess of economic and social catching-up indeveloping countries. The World Trade Or-ganisation (WTO), the successor of the Gen-eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),deals with the liberalisation of the movementof goods and services, the protection of intel-lectual property rights and the combating ofunfair trading practices. The Bank for Inter-national Settlements (BIS) works to promotecooperation between central banks in allspheres of activity and has also become theinternational centre for cooperation amongbanking supervisors. Finally, there is the Or-ganisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD), which was initially thedriving force behind the liberalisation of themovement of goods and capital in industrialcountries and – with the world economybecoming more globalised – today mainlytackles structural policy problems of its mem-ber states. This formal cooperation in thefield of economic and monetary policy is sup-
plemented by informal cooperation withinthe framework of the Group of Seven (G7)and the Group of Ten (G10). In addition, theEuropean Union (EU) is of prime importancefor Europe. By dismantling trade barriers andremoving all restrictions with regard to pro-duction factors, the EU countries haveformed a single market. In addition, somepolicy areas have been subordinated to acommon responsibility. With the introductionof the euro, monetary policy sovereignty, inparticular, shifted to the European level;meanwhile, the integration of the productand financial markets is being driven by thesingle currency.

In 1999 two further informal bodies in whichthe Bundesbank participates were added tothe already numerous mechanisms for inter-national cooperation. These are the FinancialStability Forum (FSF), which owes its exist-ence to a proposal made by the former Presi-dent of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer,
2
and the Group of Twenty (G20), which, incontrast to the G7 and G10, also includes im-portant emerging markets.
In addition, European Monetary Union has
led to enhanced cooperation between theeuro area governments. The newly estab-

17lished informal Eurogroup of economics and
finance ministers works to this end. In add-ition, the establishment of the European Cen-tral Bank (ECB) has resulted in close cooper-ation between itself and the national centralbanks participating in the European Systemof Central Banks (ESCB). This cooperation re-lies on the support of a total of 13 key com-mittees on which, in addition to the Eurosys-tem (the ECB and the national central banksof the euro area countries), representatives ofthe other EU central banks serve if the topicsunder discussion fall within the competenceof the General Council of the ECB or are ofgeneral interest. The International RelationsCommittee (IRC) plays a special role in that itdeals mainly with international issues and – asfar as is necessary or expedient – developscommon positions.
Recent developments at the
international level
Initial experiences with the FSFAs shown by the international financial crises
of the 1990s, if balance of payments prob-lems occur, a crisis can be seriously exacer-bated by shortcomings in the financial sys-tems of emerging markets. For example,countries whose banks had little equity cap-ital but a large number of unreliable borrow-ers and considerable short-term foreign cur-rency liabilities were hit twice over in a crisisof confidence. Such countries not only foundthemselves in balance of payments difficultiesbut also had to deal with a crisis in their bank-ing system. Private foreign lenders were ofteninsufficiently aware of these kinds of country
risk. Also, foreign suppliers of funds frequent-ly found themselves in a tight corner in theemerging markets because of a general lackof transparency with regard to the local eco-nomic situation and local economic policy. Inaddition, in the 1990s greater attention wasdrawn to the fact that if important hedgefunds
3get into difficulties, this can also gen-
erate considerable instability on the financialmarkets. The sudden high losses of a largeAmerican hedge fund (LTCM) which came tolight in August and September 1998 (Russianbalance of payments crisis) as a result of adramaticworldwide interest rate hike forinternational and national risk paper sent outsignals to this effect. All these problems andthe inherent dangers for the world economyas a whole formed the backdrop againstwhich the Financial Stability Forum was es-tablished in April 1999. President Tietmeyer’sproposal was made in response to an enquirywhich the G7 asked him to conduct in Octo-ber 1998. His concept was approved at theG7 meeting in February 1999. In addition tothe finance ministries, central banks andbanking supervisory authorities of the G7countries, the members of the new informalbody include the central banks of four furtherimportant international financial centres (asfrom September 1999) and representatives ofthose international organisations and bodies
3“Hedge funds” is the term used to mean financial insti-
tutions which consciously take high risks, sometimes on
a low equity basis (although the designation “hedge
funds” is not entirely apt today since it dates back to an
earlier practice when, in contrast to credit risk exposures,
market risks were hedged). In various respects, hedge
funds are highly leveraged institutions (HLIs). HLIs typical-
ly work with high levels of borrowing, are subject to little
or no supervision and have only very limited disclosure

18which address matters of financial market
stability in depth. The task of the Forum is toexpose financial market problems in goodtime and to identify ways of resolving existingdifficulties. The General Manager of the BIS,Andrew Crockett, was appointed ad perso-
namChairman of the FSF. From the start of
2001 he has the support of a worldwide ad-visory board whose task is, in particular, toacquaint the Forum with the views of the fi-nancial industry. The FSF meets twice a yearat the level of deputy ministers and deputycentral bank governors. Support is providedby a secretariat established at the BIS and adhocworking groups. The international bodiesworking together within the Forum also haveto deal with the implementation of the rec-ommendations made by this body.
The Forum has addressed in some depth the
question of how the financial systems of allcountries could be made more resistant to cri-sis by generally observing certain internation-ally recognised standards and codes. Thereare currently no fewer than 66 such sets ofrecommendations. It would hardly be pos-sible for them to be implemented quickly andin full – even by countries in an advancedstate of development. As the first step alongthis path, the Forum defined 12 areas inwhich each country should endeavour toapply international standards as quickly aspossible. These standards and codes

19– First, the main issue is the implementation
of internationally agreed rules that are in-tended to set the financial markets onfirm foundations. Primarily, this means en-suring that banks, insurance companiesand securities markets are adequatelysupervised. To this is added the requisitecompliance with recognised principles ofcorporate governance, accounting andauditing. Further rules focus on the abilityof the payments systems to withstand acrisis. In addition, certain principles of in-solvency law (which have yet to be estab-lished in detail) are intended to help toremove widespread legal uncertainties inthis area in emerging markets.
– A second category of provisions aims at
ensuring the up-to-date publication of asufficiently broad range of reliable eco-nomicdata. As the past has shown, lend-ers have frequently been encouraged toovercommit themselves because of over-optimisticnotions about, for example, theamount of monetary reserves.
– The third set of rules is aimed at encour-
aging the anti-inflationary orientation ofmonetary and budgetary policy and at re-inforcing the conditions under administra-tive law conducive to establishing financialmarkets that are as stable as possible. Inorder to achieve these targets, the inter-nationally agreed codes require a country’spolicy to be disclosed in line with certainstandards. This includes, for example, an-nouncing the intermediate and final mon-etary policy targets, providing extensivedetails of the government budget and giv-ing the publicprec ise information about
all the rules that apply to the financialmarkets. The strengths and weaknessesrevealed by such criteria are intended tocontribute to the swift implementation ofnecessary reforms.
The IMF and the World Bank play an import-
ant role in ensuring that internationally recog-nised standards and codes are implementedas quickly as possible. Both institutions play aleading role in this respect because overallstrengthening of the financial systems in themember states is one of their key tasks. Thecoordination of their increased activity in thisarea is carried out by the joint Financial SectorLiaison Committee, which was set up in1998. Under the umbrella of this committee,in 1999 the Bretton Woods institutions start-ed to implement Financial Sector AssessmentPrograms (FSAPs) for selected countries on avoluntary basis as part of a pilot project. Forspecial issues they have the support of ex-perts from other international bodies or for-eign national authorities. These programmesserve, within the framework of an inter-nationally consistent procedure, to make thecountry concerned aware of vulnerabilities ofits financial sector and to determine develop-ment priorities with the relevant authorities.The IMF uses such analyses, which are in fu-ture to be carried out for each country rough-ly every four to five years, to prepare its Re-ports on the Observance of Standards andCodes (ROSCs). These reports, which, how-ever, may also be drafted independently of anFSAP, describe national practices in the specif-icareas and c lose with an evaluation of theextent to which the procedural method is in

20line with the corresponding international
standards and codes. Financial Sector StabilityAssessments are also prepared by the IMF onthe basis of an FSAP. These analyses contain afull assessment of the state of the financialsystem in question as well as information onthe associated risks for overall economic de-velopment. Regular country monitoring (Art-icle IV Consultations) sets the frameworkwithin which findings can be discussed withthe relevant authorities. This procedure pro-vides the Executive Directors of the IMF andthe World Bank not least with indications ofthe need for technical assistance. What ismore difficult is to fulfil the aim of makingsufficient information about the state of eachfinancial system available to private lenders,too. Many emerging markets fear that theycould put themselves at a significant finan-cing disadvantage by drawing public atten-tion to ongoing inadequacies. For the timebeing, account therefore only needs to betaken of the transparency requirement bypublishing the Reports on the Observance ofStandards and Codes, for which the IMF,however, needs to obtain the approval of themember state concerned. Although the Fi-nancial Sector Stability Assessments should,in principle, also be published, the memberstate under review – if it has given the basicgo-ahead for publication – may insist on de-leting highly market-sensitive information.
It is important to find sufficient interest
among international investors in the coursetaken. Only in this manner can appropriateexpression be given in the credit ratings to in-formation about the extent to which debtorcountries are observing the aforementionedrecommendations and, as appropriate, about
the evaluation of stability in the financial sec-tor. The more this occurs, the greater the in-centive for emerging markets to improve theinfrastructure of their financial systems asquickly and as extensively as possible. The FSFhas played its part in this by making a numberof proposals as to how its members canheighten awareness among private lendersand rating agencies of the importance ofstandards and codes and as to the kinds ofspecial incentives which might be used to en-courage the emerging markets to promotethe implementation process. An implementa-tion incentive suggested by the Forum could,for example, consist of the industrial coun-tries placing greater emphasis on compliancewith standards and codes in their decisionsrelated to the access of foreign financial insti-tutions to the domesticfinanc ial market.Such an undertaking would be simplified if –to take account of any possible locational pol-icy concerns on the part of specific industrial-ised countries – international consistencycould be guaranteed.
Another important focus of the Forum’s activ-
ity to date relates to the possible risks associ-ated with excessive short-term external debt.Large short-term foreign currency liabilitieson the part of the government and bankswere the main reason why the crises of confi-dence in recent years were able to lead tosuch dramatic balance of payments crises.The Forum has therefore looked very closelyat the problem of the volatility of short-termcapital flows. Its published conclusions arewide-ranging. At the core is the recommen-dation made to the publicsec tor that it

21should not only aim at minimising the costs
of borrowing, but also bear in mind the ad-vantages of longer-term financing in terms ofcrisis prevention. If short-term governmentexternal debt cannot be avoided, the Forumconsiders that this should be set against ap-propriate monetary reserves. Moreover, themonetary authorities of debtor countries areadvised to bear in mind at least banks’short-term foreign currency debts when setting thetargets for the level of monetary reserves. TheIMF and the World Bank are currently draftinga series of guidelines for government debtmanagement which will give practical point-ers as to how the criterion of risk reductioncan best be observed. The Bundesbank hasgiven its firm support to these initiatives,which tackle the roots of the most recentdebt crises and are also in line with its long-standing policy of warning the German gov-ernment against rising and excessive short-term government debt.
Given the nature of hedge funds and other
highly leveraged institutions (HLIs), the afore-mentioned problems raised by these institu-tions do not play a major role in terms of in-vestor protection. However, the likelihood ofinsolvency of important HLIs entailing difficul-ties for the banks involved in them cannot beruled out. The outcome could be disruptionsto the global financial system as a whole. TheForum is consequently endeavouring to worktowards greater indirect control of HLIs.Measures have been proposed to ensure thatHLIs and lending banks tighten up their in-ternal risk management. Should the envis-aged indirect measures prove to be insuffi-cient, the Forum will check whether such in-stitutions can be subjected to an additional
direct control. No HLIs are set up in Germanybecause the provisions of the Act on Invest-ment Companies stand in the way of thiskind of business policy. Moreover, investmentin foreign HLIs may not be offered publicly inGermany as such investment models, due totheir limited risk diversification, do not com-ply with the requirements of the Act on theSale of Foreign Investment Fund Units.
In summary, the Financial Stability Forum has
clearly achieved recognition in the institution-al network of international cooperation. Itscomparative advantage over other bodies isthat the cooperation it instils substantiallysimplifies and speeds up the coordination be-tween all bodies concerned that is needed todeal with complex issues. As it is an informalbody, the FSF’s recommendations do not havethe authority of those made by an inter-national organisation. However, this draw-back is offset by the fact that the Forum triesto implement its proposals for reform – asmentioned above – solely via its members.The decision-making procedures of the cor-responding organisations and bodies are thusunaffected. In practice, the Forum thereforealso relies on the G7 and the G20 lendingpolitical support to its recommendations.Having addressed the problems that it wasasked to tackle at the beginning of its activity,the Forum will in future concentrate evenmore on systematically monitoring all thosecurrent developments which could jeopardisethe satisfactory functioning of the inter-national monetary and financial system.

can be addressed openly.
Significance of the G20Similarly to the Financial Stability Forum, the
G20 was called into being on the initiative ofthe G7. The meeting at which this new infor-mal group was launched took place in Berlinin December 1999. The intention to set upthe G20 was announced by the G7 financeministers in June 1999 (in their Report onStrengthening the International FinancialArchitecture to the economic summit in Col-ogne) and was reaffirmed in September 1999by the communiquk’Iv) of the finance ministersand central bank governors of the G7. TheG20’s task is to improve the dialogue be-tween industrial countries and emerging mar-kets on important matters related to the
international monetary and financial system.In practice, this means encouraging agree-ment on desirable reforms. The G20 there-fore sets out, inter alia, to pave the way for
decisions in the Bretton Woods institutions,while helping to put their policy into practiceby setting an example. It was preceded bysimilar temporary dialogue and review groupswhich were set up in 1998 (G22) and 1999(G33) on similar G7 initiatives. In addition tothe G7 countries, the EU and Australia,11 emerging markets of significance to theworld economy are members of the G20. TheG20 thus represents two-thirds of the worldpopulation, 80% of world trade (includingtrade within the EU) and 90% of the globalgross national product.

23with those of the IMF and the World Bank,
representatives of the two financial institu-tions participate in this group as ex officio
members. Given the focus on the internation-al monetary and financial system, the centralbanks of the member states are permanentmembers with equal status, with the EUbeing represented by the Presidency of theCouncil and the ECB. The G20 meets once ayear at the level of finance ministers and cen-tral bank governors.
The New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) be-
tween the IMF and a group of 25 industrialcountries and emerging markets which cameinto force in 1998 – concluded according tothe pattern set by the General Arrangementsto Borrow (GAB) – do not constitute a groupof countries capable of pursuing the object-ives of the G20 in a similar manner. In add-
ition to the G10 countries working togetheron the basis of the GAB, the NAB include nu-merous other industrial countries but, in all,only seven emerging markets, some of whichare in any case today no longer considered fi-nancially strong (a requirement of the NAB).The NAB participants (as in the G10 and G20,represented in each case by the governmentand the central bank) meet regularly to dis-cuss current issues in the margins of the an-nual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank,but this group of countries cannot claim tocarry out a representative dialogue betweenindustrial countries and emerging markets.

25Interim Committee of the IMF was upgraded
on a recommendation by the G7 with effectfrom spring 2000 by its being transformedinto a permanent body which was thennamed the IMFC. As a committee of theBoard of Governors, the IMFC has an import-ant control and mediation function in respectof the decision-making bodies of the IMF(Board of Governors and Executive Board). Tothis end, the Committee meets twice a yearat the level of the finance ministers (with theparticipation of the central banks). Its countrycomposition parallels the current representa-tion of all IMF members in the ExecutiveBoard. This means that those countries thatdo not have their own Executive Director inthe IMF are represented within the frame-work of country groups (constituencies), part-ly by continuously re-elected spokesmancountries (mainly industrial countries) butmainly by countries which take turns to act asspokesman. As a forum for the dialogue be-tween industrial countries and emerging mar-kets, the G20 therefore has certain advan-tages over the IMFC. Owing to its focus onthe two Bretton Woods institutions, it is alsomore broadly oriented. However, because ofits formal legitimation and the full representa-tion of IMF members, the IMFC’s control andmediatory function remains secure.
At the first G20 meeting in Berlin in Decem-
ber 1999 the participating countries under-took to take an exemplary lead in the imple-mentation embarked upon by the IMF andthe World Bank of the Financial Sector As-sessment Programs (FSAPs) and in the draft-ing of Reports on the Observance of Stand-ards and Codes (ROSCs). The second G20meeting in Montreal in October 2000 was de-
voted to the opportunities and challengesafforded by globalisation. The common de-nominator in this discussion was the convic-tion that economic integration can continueto be a major driving force for economic andsocial progress in all countries. The communi-quk’Iv) issued by the group lists a number of fea-tures which should be taken into accountwith regard to the globalisation process sothat the problems arising from increasingcompetition can be mastered. The communi-quk’Iv) cites the support of all ongoing initiativeswhich aim to gradually reduce the financialvulnerability of emerging markets as being ofprime importance. In addition, the statementstresses the urgent need for a number of de-velopment policy measures.
Recent developments at the European
level
Enhanced coordination within the
Eurogroup
Even before it had been decided which coun-
tries would participate in European MonetaryUnion, the European Council had em-powered the euro area economics and fi-nance ministers to meet informally as a groupof euro area countries to discuss issues re-lated to their particular responsibility for thesingle currency. This authorisation is part ofthe Resolution of the European Council ofDecember 1997 on economic policy coordin-ation in stage three of Economic and Monet-ary Union (EMU) and on Articles 111 and 113(ex Articles 109 and 109b) of the Treaty es-

26tablishing the European Community (EC
Treaty).5The Resolution of the European
Council affirms that the EU Council in thecomposition of the economics and financeministers (Ecofin Council) shall function asforeseen in the EC Treaty as the central eco-nomic policy coordination body of the EUcountries because this is the only way that co-hesion of the EU as a whole can be ensured.This concerns, in particular, decision-makingpowers. However, it goes without saying thatmatters related to the functioning of Monet-ary Union require particular attention on thepart of those countries which have adoptedthe single currency. With the planned gradualexpansion of the EU from the current 15 toup to 28 member states, the existing restric-tion of Monetary Union to a part of the EUarea only is further accentuated and this lackof congruence is likely to continue for a rela-tively lengthy period of time because of thebroad, fundamental process of convergencewhich is required for accession to MonetaryUnion. The empowerment of the EuropeanCouncil to strengthen cooperation amongthe euro area economics and finance minis-ters therefore took account of a developmentthe increasing significance of which could notnecessarily be foreseen when the MaastrichtTreaty was formulated. The Eurogroup was,in fact, formed at the start of MonetaryUnion. The Resolution of the European Coun-cil provides that the European Commissionmust be involved in all meetings of this kind.In addition, the Eurogroup has consistentlymade use of the opportunity referred to inthe Resolution of including the ECB in itsmeetings. The group is led, as a matter ofprinciple, by the six-monthly rotating presi-dency of the Ecofin Council.
6If the presi-
dency of the Ecofin Council falls to a countrywhich is not participating in Monetary Union(for example, Sweden in the first half of2001), the presidency of the Eurogroup is as-sumed by the subsequent euro area countryin the Ecofin Council (e.g. Belgium thus as-sumes the presidency of the Eurogroup forthe whole of 2001). The group meets, in prin-ciple, once a month, on the day before themonthly meeting of the Ecofin Council.When France assumed the presidency of theEurogroup for the first time in the second halfof 2000, the activity of this body was intensi-fied. So far, the Eurogroup has taken an in-depth look at economic and budgetary devel-opment in the euro area countries and theirproblems in the field of structural policy. Notleast, it has addressed the causes of theperiod of marked weakness of the euro.
Market participants as well as official repre-
sentatives of the euro area have frequently at-tributed the weakness of the euro, in part, tothe fact that the public fails to perceive theeuro area as an autonomous political entity.This kind of criticism at least raises an import-ant issue. From the outset, as preparationsfor Monetary Union were being made, theBundesbank had made a point of stressingthat a monetary union needs a political foun-dation if it is to be able to function properlyover the long term. This implies the need forefficient Community bodies as well as for acoherent way of tackling important policy

27areas. Otherwise it would difficult to imagine
how a basis of confidence for the euro,which would remain unshaken in times of dif-ficulty, could be established on the financialmarkets. Consequently, the Eurogroup ofeconomics and finance ministers cannot be asubstitute for the necessary broad politicalbasis of the single currency but can makeonly a relatively modest contribution in thisrespect. Vigilance is even called for so thatgreater cooperation between the euro areacountries than in the Ecofin Council does notfoster ideas that are also focused on monet-ary policy and would, in the long run, tend tobe detrimental to the internal and externalstability of the euro.
The necessary strengthening of political inte-
gration must take account of the specialEuropean situation, which is characterised bya vast cultural, historical, economic and polit-ical multiplicity. In view of this rich heritage,the integration process is likely to boil downfinally to a political structure sui generis .T h e
decisions taken at the European intergovern-mental conference in Nice in December 2000will further strengthen the institutional infra-structure in Europe, even if the achievementslag considerably behind expectations and le-gitimate aspirations. In addition, the Union isendeavouring, on the basis of the treaties ofMaastricht and Amsterdam, to develop acommon foreign and security policy (CFSP),to strengthen cooperation in legal and intern-al policy and, in part, to develop it into a com-mon policy. It is, however, easy to conceive offurther areas that might appropriately becovered by a broader common policy, e.g.environmental protection. Overall, there istherefore still a lot of catching up to be done
in terms of measures which could contributeto founding a pan-European identity whilegiving the euro more political backing.
Nonetheless, there is only a partial need for
further harmonisation in the policy areas thatare directly relevant to the functioning ofEuropean Monetary Union. By means of theStability and Growth Pact, which clarifies therulings of the EC Treaty and establishes theconditions of their concrete application, keyarrangements were made to preclude the riskof the anti-inflationary monetary policy beingjeopardised by lax budgetary policies. In add-ition, economic policy which is committed tofree market principles and based mainly onfree price formation, competition, the inter-national division of labour and the unrestrict-ed movement of capital constitutes the bestconceivable foundation for a stability-orient-ed monetary policy. These necessary founda-tions also include further progress towards aregulatory tax framework which guaranteesfair competition across the whole of Europeand thus safeguards the functioning of thesingle market. However, it is neither neces-sary nor desirable to aim for a common finan-cial policy which goes beyond the require-ments of the Stability and Growth Pact. Simi-larly in wage and structural policy, neithercentral decisions nor cross-border coordin-ation is necessary to safeguard MonetaryUnion over the long term. Rather, all threeareas referred to need to conduct a policy ofreform that is geared to the country-specificobstacles to growth and employment. Whatis needed is consistent budgetary consolida-tion, ongoing decentralisation of wage agree-

28Deutsche BundesbankResolution ofthe European Council of13 December 1997 on economic policy coordination in stage 3
ofEMU and on Treaty Articles 109 and 109b ofthe EC Treaty*
I.Coordination of economic policies in stage 3 of economic
and monetary union (EMU)
1. EMU will link the economies ofthe euro-area Member States
more closely together. They will share a single monetary pol-icy and a single exchange rate. Cyclical developments are like-ly to converge further. Economic policies, and wage deter-mination, however, remain a national responsibility, subjectto the provisions ofArticle 104c ofthe Treaty and the Stabilityand Growth Pact. To the extent that national economic devel-opments have an impact on inflation prospects in the euro-area, they will influence monetary conditions in that area. Itis for this basic reason that the move to a single currency willrequire closer Community surveillance and coordination ofeconomic policies among euro-area Member States.
2. Economic and monetary interdependence with non-partici-
pating Member States will also be strong; they all participatein the single market. The need to ensure further convergenceand a smooth functioning of the single market therefore re-quires all Member States to be included in the coordinationofeconomic policies. Moreover, interdependence will be es-pecially strong ifnon euro-area Member States participate inthe new exchange rate mechanism, as countries with a dero-gation are expected to.
3. Enhanced economic policy coordination should give full at-
tention to national economic developments and policieswhich have the potential to influence monetary and financialconditions throughout the euro area or the smooth function-ing ofthe internal market. This includes:
– close monitoring ofmacroeconomic developments in
Member States to ensure sustained convergence, and ofexchange-rate developments ofthe euro,
– surveillance ofbudgetary positions and policies in accord-
ance with the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact,
– monitoring ofMember States’ structural policies in labour,
product and services markets, as well as ofcost and pricetrends, particularly insofar as they affect the chances ofachieving sustained non-inflationary growth and job cre-ation, and
– the fostering of tax reform to raise efficiency and the dis-
couragement ofharmf ul tax competition.
Enhanced economic policy coordination must adhere to the
Treaty principle ofsubsidiarity, respect the prerogatives ofna-tional governments in determining their structural andbudgetary policies subject to the provisions ofthe Treaty andthe Stability and Growth Pact, respect the independence ofthe European System ofCentral Banks (ESCB) in pursuing itsprimary objective ofprice stability and the role ofthe Ecof inCouncil as the central decision-making body for economic co-ordination, and respect national traditions and the compe-tences and responsibilities ofthe social partners in the wage
formation process.
4. To ensure the smooth functioning of EMU, the Council, the
Commission and the Member States are called upon to applythe Treaty instruments for economic policy coordination fullyand effectively.
To this end, the broad economic policy guidelines adopted in
accordance with Article 103(2) ofthe Treaty should be de-veloped into an effective instrument for ensuring sustainedconvergence ofMember States. They should provide moreconcrete and country-specific guidelines and focus more onmeasures to improve Member States’ growth potential, thusincreasing employment. Therefore, more attention shouldhenceforth be paid in them to improving competitiveness,labour-, product- and services-market efficiency, educationand training, and to making taxation and social protectionsystems more employment-friendly.
Enhanced coordination should be aimed at securing consist-
ency ofnational economic policies and their implementationwith the broad economic policy guidelines and the properfunctioning of EMU. Economic policies and development ineach Member State and in the Community should be moni-tored in the framework of multilateral surveillance accordingto Article 103(3) ofthe Treaty. Particular attention should bepaid to giving early warning, not only ofthreatening budget-ary situations in accordance with the Stability and GrowthPact, but also ofother developments which, ifallowed to per-sist, might threaten stability, competitiveness and future jobcreation. To this end, the Council is expected to be moreready to make the necessary recommendations in accordancewith Article 103(4) ofthe Treaty to a Member State wheneverits economic policies are not consistent with the broad eco-nomic policy guidelines. For its part, the Member State con-cerned should commit itselfto take timely and ef f icient meas-ures which it deems necessary to respond to the Council’s rec-ommendations. Moreover, the Member States should committhemselves to a comprehensive and speedy exchange ofin-formation on economic developments and policy intentionswith a cross-border impact.
5. Monitoring ofthe economic situation and policy discussions
should become a regular item on the agenda ofinf ormal Eco-fin sessions. In order to stimulate an open and frank debate,the Ecofin Council should from time to time meet in restrictedsessions (minister plus one), particularly when conductingmultilateral surveillance.
6. Under the terms ofthe Treaty, the Ecof in Council
1is the
centre for the coordination of the Member States’ economicpolicies and is empowered to act in the relevant areas. In par-ticular, the Ecofin Council is the only body empowered to for-mulate and adopt the broad economic policy guidelineswhich constitute the main instrument ofeconomic coordin-ation.

the economic coordination and decision-making processaffirms the unity and cohesion of the Community.
The Ministers ofthe States participating in the euro-area may
meet informally among themselves to discuss issues connectedwith their shared specific responsibilities for the single cur-rency. The Commission, and the European Central Bank (ECB)when appropriate, will be invited to take part in the meetings.
Whenever matters ofcommon interest are concerned they
will be discussed by Ministers ofall Member States.
Decisions will in all cases be taken by the Ecofin Council in
accordance with the procedures determined by the Treaty.
II.Implementing the Treaty provisions on the exchange-rate
policy, external position and representation of theCommunity (Article 109 of the Treaty)
7. The European Council recognises the responsibility which will
fall to the Community with the introduction of the euro, oneofthe major currencies in the world monetary system. Thecontribution ofthe Community through the ESCB, in strict ac-cordance with the competences and procedures establishedby the Treaty, will be to provide a centre ofprice stability. Forits part, the European Council is resolved to play its full partin helping to lay the foundations for a prosperous and effi-cient economy in the Community, in accordance with theprinciple of an open economy with free competition, favour-ing an efficient allocation of resources, and in compliancewith the principles set out in Article 3a ofthe Treaty. TheEuropean Council is convinced that this will provide the basesfor a currency which is strong and respected.
8. The Council should monitor the development ofthe ex-
change rate ofthe euro in the light ofa wide range ofeco-nomic data. The Commission should provide analyses to theCouncil, and the Economic and Financial Committee shouldprepare the Council’s reviews. It is important to make full useofthe Treaty provisions to ensure an exchange ofinf ormationand views between the Council and the ECB on the exchangerate ofthe euro. While in general exchange rates should beseen as the outcome ofall other economic policies, the Coun-cil may, in exceptional circumstances, for example in the caseof a clear misalignment, formulate general orientations forexchange-rate policy in relation to non-EC currencies in ac-cordance with Article 109(2) ofthe Treaty. These generalorientations should always respect the independence oftheESCB and be consistent with the primary objective oftheESCB to maintain price stability.
9. The Council should decide on the position ofthe Community
at international level as regards issues ofparticular relevanceto economic and monetary union, in accordance with Article109(4) ofthe Treaty. These positions will be relevant both tobilateral relations between the European Union and individ-ual third countries and to proceedings in international orga-
nizations or informal international groupings. The scope ofthis provision is necessarily limited as only euro-area MemberStates vote under Article 109.
10.The Council and the European Central Bank will carry out
their tasks in representing the Community at internationallevel in an efficient manner and in compliance with the allo-cation ofpowers laid down in the Treaty. On elements ofeco-nomic policy other than monetary and exchange-rate policy,the Member States should continue to present their policiesoutside the Community framework, while taking full accountofthe Community interest. The Commission will be involvedin external representation to the extent required to enable itto perform the role assigned to it by the Treaty.
Representation in international organizations should take ac-
count ofthose organizations’ rules. With particular regard tothe Community’s relations with the International MonetaryFund (IMF), they should be predicated upon the provision inthat Fund’s Articles ofAgreement that only countries can bemembers ofthat institution. The Member States, in their cap-acities as members ofthe IMF, should help to establish prag-matic arrangements which would facilitate the conduct ofIMF surveillance and the presentation ofCommunity pos-itions, including the views ofthe ESCB, in IMF f ora.
III.Dialogue between the Council and the ECB11.In the light ofthe allocation ofresponsibilities laid down in
the Treaty, the harmonious economic development oftheCommunity in stage 3 ofEMU will call f or continuous andfruitful dialogue between the Council and the ECB, involvingthe Commission and respecting all aspects ofthe independ-ence ofthe ESCB.
12.The Council should therefore play its full part in exploiting
the channels ofcommunication provided by the Treaty. ThePresident ofthe Council, using his position under Article 109bofthe Treaty, should report to the Governing Council oftheECB on the Council’s assessment ofthe economic situation ofthe Union and on economic policies ofthe Member Statesand could discuss with the ECB the views ofthe Council on ex-change-rate developments and prospects. The Treaty providesin turn for the ECB President to attend Council meetingswhenever the Council is discussing matters relating to the ob-jectives and tasks ofthe ESCB, f or instance when the broadeconomic policy guidelines are being developed. Importancealso attaches to the annual reports which the ECB will maketo the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission,as well as to the European Council.
The Economic and Financial Committee, which will bring to-
gether senior officials from the national central banks andthe ECB as well as from finance ministries, will provide theframework within which the dialogue can be prepared andcontinued at the level ofsenior of f icials.

30ments and further flexibilisation of the labour
and product markets. By putting “peer pres-sure” on its members, the Eurogroup canserve Monetary Union well. At its meeting inNice in December 2000, the European Coun-cil rightly established structural policy chal-lenges as the focus of the Eurogroup’s tasks,as can be seen from the published presidencyconclusions. It is in keeping with this role ofthe Eurogroup that the right conferred on thePresident of the Ecofin Council pursuant tothe EC Treaty to take part in meetings of theGoverning Council of the ECB as an observeris taken up by the President of the Eurogroupas a result of an informal agreement in theEcofin Council, if – as in the first half of 2001– the country heading the Ecofin Council isnot participating in Monetary Union.
The scepticism confronting the Eurogroup
has to do with fears that this body, in contrastto the important tasks outlined above, couldfunction mainly as a political counterweightto the Governing Council of the ECB, i.e. as asort of control mechanism. It was thereforevery helpful that at its meeting in December1999 the European Council, by accepting areport by the Ecofin Council, stressed that theECB will participate in cooperation amongthe euro area countries in the field of eco-nomic policy simply in the context of a dia-logue, without going so far as to bring mon-etary policy in line ex ante with other policy
areas. In order to defuse once and for all theideas concerning the Governing Council ofthe ECB which are not in keeping with the ECTreaty, it is also necessary to make a clear dis-tinction between the overlapping responsibil-ities of the governments of the memberstates and of the Governing Council of the
ECB in the field of exchange rate policy. Pur-suant to Article 111 of the EC Treaty (ex Art-icle 109), the Ecofin Council may, actingunanimously (but pursuant to Article 122,with the “pre-ins” not entitled to vote) on arecommendation from the ECB or from theCommission, and after consulting the ECB,adopt, adjust or abandon formal exchangerate agreements for the euro in relation tonon-Community currencies. In addition, theCouncil may, acting by a qualified majority, bythe otherwise same procedure, formulategeneral orientations for exchange rate policywhich, however, must not jeopardise the pri-mary objective of European Central Bank pol-icy to maintain price stability and whichwould be binding on the Governing Councilof the ECB only to the extent that they arewithout prejudice in practice to its stability-oriented monetary policy. Moreover, suchguidelines may be formulated in exceptionalcircumstances only, for example in the case ofsignificant exchange rate misalignment.
7The
Ecofin Council’s powers in the field of ex-change rate policy involve the Council keep-ing an eye on the situation on the foreign ex-change markets. To this end the Resolution ofthe European Council of December 1997 alsoemphasises the importance of an exchangeof views and information between the bodiesresponsible for economic policy and the ECB.As mentioned above, in practice the move-ments on the foreign exchange market areevaluated mainly in the Eurogroup, whosespokesperson – who in the current 15 EUmember states usually also heads the Ecofin

31Council – represents the stance of the euro
area ministers on exchange rate issues in re-spect of other international bodies and thegeneral public. Conversely, the decision onpossible interventions on the foreign ex-change market is the sole responsibility of theGoverning Council of the ECB, as politicalmeasures aimed at protecting certain ex-change rates could conflict with the objectiveof maintaining price stability. It is true thatthe direct impact of foreign exchange marketinterventions on monetary conditions is offsetby the ECB. The expansive or contractive ef-fects of foreign exchange market operationsare countered by opposite liquidity policymeasures. However, the principle of sterilisingforeign exchange market interventions in noway rules out, in the case of a rising euro, thepossibility of political exchange rate objectivescausing considerable difficulties for monetarypolicy. Owing to the direct interdependenceof prices on external and internal markets, anexchange rate which is maintained at an arti-ficially low level can increase the inflationarypressure as a result of excessive import prices.Moreover, if the interventions were politi-cised, the main danger would be that at-tempts to stem an increase in the exchangerate by buying currency could set up strongpolitical pressure for a relaxation of monetarypolicy. At the end of the day, such an impactwould feed doubts as to whether Europeanmonetary policy, as previously the Bundes-bank’s policy, will remain committed to pur-chasing power stability whatever the circum-stances. The Eurogroup should therefore takecare not to give the public the impression ofwanting to be involved in defining interven-tion policy. Its role can only be to support pos-sible foreign exchange market interventions
by means of corresponding economic and fi-nancial policy measures. What must be con-sidered here are the periods of weakness ofthe euro, which could indicate a need foreconomic policy to be adjusted. Moreover, itshould be stressed that should there be critic-al exchange rate developments, in view ofthe close integration of the euro area in theglobal economy, foreign exchange marketinterventions can never significantly offsetthe flow of currency caused by exchange ratevolatility. Interventions can only be a signalthat the Governing Council of the ECB viewscertain exchange rate developments as prob-lematic. Before the ECB gives such a sign, itmust be thoroughly convinced that the eco-nomic and monetary policy framework condi-tions allow exchange rate misalignment to bereliably diagnosed. If there were any doubtsin this respect, intervention could be ineffect-ive and, even more, it could increase the pres-sure on the foreign exchange markets.
Role ofthe IRC in European cooperationThe task of the International Relations Com-
mittee (IRC), which was set up within theframework of the ESCB in the second half of1998 (i.e. before the start of MonetaryUnion), is to prepare the required commonpositions with regard to all international mat-ters which fall within the field of competenceof the Eurosystem and the ESCB (includingmonetary policy issues related to the east-ward enlargement of the EU). However, theCommittee’s mandate approved by the Gov-erning Council of the ECB goes still further.The Committee is, in particular, to monitor

32the functioning of the international monetary
system and the international financial mar-kets and to adopt a position on the relatedproblems discussed at an international leveland on the possibilities for improvement. TheCommittee meets at the level of members ofthe decision-making bodies of the ECB andthe national central banks. The meetings takeplace, in principle, once a month in the com-position of the Eurosystem. If matters are dis-cussed which are related to the tasks of theGeneral Council of the ECB (such as the Euro-pean exchange rate regime), the representa-tives of the “pre-ins” also participate. Theyalso take part in IRC meetings if matters ofinternational importance are discussed whichgo beyond the competence of the Eurosys-tem and the ESCB. On essential matters be-yond the sphere of responsibility of the Euro-system or the ESCB, the IRC simply indicatesbasicorientations (“c ommon understand-ings”, “common views” or “common termsof reference”) to the decision-making bodies(Governing Council and General Council ofthe ECB) rather than making proposals for acommon position. They are to act as guide-lines for the national and international activ-ities of all central banks in the ESCB.
Coordination within the ESCB in the case of
important international matters which go be-yond its statutory competence is, in the finalanalysis, a result of the obligation of the EUcentral banks to maintain price stability andof the mandate of the ESCB to support thecompetent authorities in the field of bankingsupervision and the stability of the financialsystem. Each central bank which pursues astability-oriented policy must be interested inshaping the various facets of the functioning
of the international monetary and financialsystem in such as way as to enable a soundeconomic and monetary policy to be imple-mented in as many countries as possible anda high degree of stability of the banking andfinancial systems to be ensured. Otherwise itsown stability policy can be jeopardised, eitherby imported inflation or by difficulties in itsown banking system caused by foreign bor-rowers. The Bundesbank has been very in-volved from the outset in all matters relatedto the monetary and financial system. TheESCB continues to pursue this line. It is there-fore, for example, a good thing that joint dis-cussions in the IRC on the future role of inter-national official financial support have pro-duced a consensus to jointly aim at achievinga turn-around in crisis management leadingto far greater involvement on the part of pri-vate creditors. This is the key to ensuring abetter functioning of the international finan-cial markets over the long term.
The positions agreed within the IRC (and ul-
timately in the decision-making bodies of theECB) on those international matters whichfall within the competence of the Eurosystemor the ESCB are basically represented by theECB in other European bodies (Economic andFinancial Committee, Eurogroup and EcofinCouncil) and at the international level. Bycontrast, common basic orientations with re-gard to aspects which lie outside Communitycompetence only provide the ECB and the in-dividual national central banks with a basison which they can continue to work inde-pendently towards accredited objectives. Thenational central banks thus also have, in par-

content of surveydata on expectedprice developmentsfor monetary policyInflation expectations play a key role
in shorter-term price developmentsand in the impact of monetary policy.One way of measuring them is to dir-ectly ask market participants for theirassessment of the outlook for prices.The following article describes howthe qualitative data from the Euro-pean Commission’s Consumer Surveyand the surveys of professional expertsconducted by Consensus Economicscan be used to derive measures of ex-pected price developments.
The time series computed from the sur-
vey data not only yield valuable infor-mation about future risks to price sta-bility but may also be used to gain newinsights into the link between inflationand inflation expectations. The empir-ical studies presented in this articleunderscore the importance of inflationexpectations for shorter-term pricedevelopments. Furthermore, they indi-cate that the expectations of a signifi-cant fraction of the professional ex-perts and households surveyed arestrongly influenced by earlier forecastsand past price developments. This be-haviour strengthens the “stickiness” ofinflation processes and thus also theneed for monetary policy makers toadopt a forward-looking approach.

Description of the survey data used
A harmonised consumer survey relating,
among other things, to assessments of pastand future price developments is conductedmonthly in the member states of the Euro-pean Union. The surveys are carried out bynational institutes; in Germany, for instance,thistaskisperformedbythe Gesellschaft f:Cw5wr
Konsumforschung (GfK).
The EU survey data are characterised by a
large sample size (up to 2,500 householdssurveyed per country) and a detailed break-downofresponsesbycategory.Therearesixcategories for each response, shown in thetableonpage38.Theavailabledatagivethepercentages of the respondents in eachresponsecategory.Owingtothelargesamplesize andtheselectioncriteria applied bythepollinginstitutes,itmaybeassumedthatthebasket of goods relevant for the surveyedhouseholds more or less corresponds to thebasket of goods of the average householdused by statistical offices to measure con-sumerpricemovements.Thesurveydatamaythus be interpreted as an assessment of thedirectionofchangeoftherespectivenationalconsumerpriceindex.

At first glance, the expectations computed
from the EU data seem to trail the actualprice trend more or less strongly. Thus thesurveyedhouseholdssystematicallyunderesti-matedinflationduringthephaseofaccelerat-ing rates of price increases up to mid-1991butthendistinctlyoverestimateditduringtheperiodofdeceleratingratesofpriceincreaseslasting from mid-1992 to mid-1993. SinceMarch 1999, price expectations have risenvirtuallyparalleltocurrentlyobservablepricedevelopments and since September 2000have been slightly above the 2% mark. Onthe other hand, it should be noted that thedownwardtrendintheinflationratebetweenmid-1993andthebeginningof1999wasan-ticipated correctly. This would indicate thatnotonlyabackward-lookingcomponentbutalso other explanatory factors play a role intheformationofexpectations.

Determinants of inflation expectations
Theempiricalstudythusconfirmstheimport-
ance of inflation expectations for shorter-term developments of consumer prices. Thishighlights the question of which determin-ants serve as an orientation for market par-ticipants in the formation of their expect-ations.Thisquestionisnotonlyoftheoreticalinterestbutalsohasimportantpracticalimpli-cations for monetary policy. If the centralbankdoesnotsucceedinanchoringinflationexpectationsatthedesiredlowlevel,itmustcombatthe“excessive”expectationsbypur-suing a restrictive monetary policy course.Theattendantrealcostsintheformofoutputand employment losses would then in turnjeopardisepublicacceptabilityofamonetarypolicygearedtopricestability.

46of thumb” to the theory of rational expect-
ations formulated by Muth.20One of the
best-knownrulesofthumbisthehypothesisof adaptive expectations, which states thateconomic agents revise their expectationsin the light of past expectation errors. Theweaknessofthesimplebackward-lookingap-proaches is their assumption that only pastprice developments and earlier forecasts areusedtoformexpectations whileotherinflu-encesaredisregarded;thiscancreatesystem-aticerrors.Inhisdefinition of“rational”ex-pectations, by contrast, Muth assumes thatthe subjective expectations of economicagentsmatchthepredictionsoftherelevanteconomic theory.
21An essential feature of
Muth’s definition of rational expectations,therefore, is that economic agents do notmakesystematicerrors.
The assumption that economic agents pos-
sess full knowledge of thetransmission pro-cessisdoubtlessanextremecasethatcannotbe maintained outside a prolonged steadystate of equilibrium.

51Structural current
account balances:longer-term trendsand determinantsGerman reunification resulted in a re-
versal in the German current accountposition. Whereas sharply rising sur-pluses had been achieved at the end ofthe eighties, there have been deficitson current transactions with non-residents since 1991. It is true that cur-rent account deficits later tended todecline, but in the past two years thesehave increased strongly again. In thefirst 11 months of the year 2000 alonethe deficit of 525 billion on Germany’s
current transactions with non-residentsexceeded the already relatively highlevel in the same period a year earlierby approximately 510 billion. By far
the greatest part ofthe downturn hasbeen due to the considerable deterior-ation in the terms oftrade resultingfrom the increase in oil prices and theweakness ofthe euro. Developmentsofthis nature, which can sometimesgive rise to significant distortions in ex-ternal positions, have frequently pro-duced short-term fluctuations in theGerman current account. That, to-gether with the effects of movementsin the different cyclical positions inter-nationally, have obscured longer-termtrends. The following article analysesthe long-term interrelationships thatdetermine Germany’s current account.

52than two decades in which trade surpluses
tended to rise the current account slippeddeeply into deficit for the first time towardsthe end of the seventies and the beginning ofthe eighties. This development was ultimatelythe result of the combined effect of externalburdens arising from the second oil crisis anddelays in adjustments at home. Once the in-ternal adjustments had been made, the econ-omy was able to recover from the deficits in-curred externally. Subsequently, the trendwas again marked by rapidly growing sur-pluses, which reached an all-time high of4.8% of gross domesticproduc t (GDP) in1989 before German reunification brought adramatic reversal in the German current ac-count. In 1991 the current account ran a def-icit equivalent to 1% of GDP whereas a yearearlier there had been a current account sur-plus amounting to 3.3% of GDP. More thanfive years then passed before the external ad-justment processes that had been set in mo-tion as a result of reunification came to anend. It was not long before German exporterswere able to revive the success they had pre-viously enjoyed in foreign markets eventhough the trade balance in terms of GDP didnot regain the dimensions it had reached forwestern Germany in the second half of theeighties.
The deficit on services rose at the same time,
however. The rise was fuelled during the firstfew years after reunification by the growingnet expenditure on foreign travel in particular.The desire of the east German population to“catch up” on foreign travel had resulted in asudden rise in expenditure by German touristsabroad.

53the level of expenditure but also growing def-
icits in other segments of the services ac-count, which comprise a broad and variedrange of categories, have emerged as detri-mental factors. Increases here include net ex-penditure on ITservices, commercial services,advertising and trade fairs as well as on com-munications.
Owing to the change in Germany’s external
position, namely from being a net capital ex-porter prior to reunification to being a capitalimporter, the external assets which Germanyhad previously accumulated and the foreigninvestment income which these had gener-ated also declined appreciably on balance. Atthe end of 1999 Germany’s net externalassets amounted to DM 193 billion at marketprices compared with DM 548 billion in mid-1991 when the highest level so far recordedhad been attained. At the same time net in-vestment income dwindled continually fromapproximately DM 32 billion in 1992 until1997 when for the first time interest pay-ments and other investment income pay-ments to non-residents exceeded the corres-ponding investment income generatedabroad. In 1999 net investment income pay-ments to non-residents amounted to justunder DM 22 billion.
Despite the – in some cases radical – changes
in external relationships following reunifica-tion, an analysis based on a longer time hori-zon also indicates a certain continuity in theimpact patterns which play a decisive role indetermining these external economic rela-tionships. For example, major fluctuations inthe current account over the past 25 yearshave often coincided with changes in the
terms of trade. The rise in the prices of crudeoil in 1979 and the fact that oil prices subse-quently persisted at an unusually high levelconstituted a significant deterioration in theterms of trade, which in the second half of1981 reached their lowest level for three dec-ades. This deterioration was first moderatedby the weakness of the US dollar towards theend of the seventies and then accentuated byits subsequent recovery. Large current ac-count deficits were associated with this.Shifts in the terms of trade also resulted insubstantial changes in the current account inthe period after 1985 when the prices in thecrude oil market fell sharply and the DeutscheMark appreciated discernibly. These develop-ments initially led to rising trade surpluses. Bycontrast, the recent weakness of the euro

54and the extremely sharp increase in oil prices
have resulted in the most pronounced deteri-oration in the terms of trade for about tenyears. It is true that exchange rate move-ments have improved the price competitive-ness of the German business sector and havefurther boosted exports which, in view of thefavourable cyclical trends in major tradingpartner countries, had been recoveringstrongly in any case. At the same time, how-ever, the price effects have also been leadingto a discernible rise in the value of importedgoods. The appreciable increase in the cost ofenergy imports accounted for a large part ofthis rise. Negative factors predominated withthe result that smaller export surpluses wereachieved.
Whereas in the short term it is the direct ef-
fects of price changes on foreign trade thatcount most, in the longer term changes inthe terms of trade also give rise to volume ad-justments which normally work in the oppos-ite direction and determine the long-termtrend. If, for example, there is a shift in therelative foreign trade prices to such an extentthat imported goods become cheaper, therewill tend to be greater demand for thesegoods and import volumes will increase. Atthe same time export goods will becomemore expensive for foreign customers, withthe result that demand for these goods willdecline and export volumes will diminish.Shifts of this kind in the terms of trade notonly bring about these substitution effectsbut also changes in the income positionwhich, in turn, spark off adjustments in sav-ing and consumption patterns.

55for home-produced goods, the real income
position improves at home. The additionalincome can be used immediately to meet agreater demand for goods (income effect).However, it can also be used for consumptionlater with the result that consumption in thefuture may be substituted for consumption inthe present, leading in the long term to an in-crease in demand at home. Which effects willeventually dominate also depends on howthe market participants handle pricing and onthe corresponding export and import elastici-ties. Generally speaking, it may be assumedthat with an increasing time horizon thenegative substitution effects will determinethe trend.
1
Growth in the respective markets, however,plays a particularly important role in deter-mining the external trend. For example, sur-pluses on trade in goods and services tend torise when growth in the export markets andtherefore foreign demand increase at a fasterpace than growth in domestic demand; andthey decline when the growth differentialshifts in favour of the home market.
Absorption approach to the
current account
Theoretically speaking, the relationships out-
lined above can be summarised in a simpleabsorption approach. As a rule, this is basedon trade in goods and services only, and fac-tor income and current transfers are disre-garded. Net exports (NX) – defined here asthe ratio of real exports of goods and servicesto real imports of these – are considered.Under the simple absorption approach these
can be seen as a function of the domestic de-mand for goods and services (domestic ab-sorption, A) and as a function of the demandfor goods and services abroad (foreign ab-sorption, A
F) in conjunction with the terms of
trade (P). The relationship can be expressed inlogarithmicform as follows:
(1) nx
t=gpt+eat+haF
t
where nx, p, a and aFare the logarithmicval-
ues of the corresponding variables. The coef-ficients g,eandhcan be interpreted as the
respective elasticities. Given the consider-ations explained above, it can be assumedthatg– that is to say, the elasticity of net ex-
ports in relation to the terms of trade – isnegative in the long term and that an im-provement in the terms of trade over thelonger term will therefore worsen the currentaccount. It can also be assumed that the co-efficient e– that is to say, the elasticity of the
export-import ratio in relation to changes indomesticabsorption – is also negative. Bycontrast, the relationship with the growth inforeign absorption ( h) should be positive.
This approach explains the respective current
account position by means of the develop-ment in the macroeconomic variables out-lined. Intertemporal absorption approacheswhich are based on microeconomics are alsoused in an attempt to explain why deficits orsurpluses occur in different periods. Attentionis focused here on the role of the current ac-count as an expression of resource allocation

56that is at once both cross-border and inter-
temporal. The occurrence of negative or posi-tive current account balances is analysedin the light of long-term consumption andinvestment decisions and the associatedbuild-up of assets or liabilities vis-bWOOq-vis non-residents.
The starting point is the consideration that –
put simply – the current account balance ofan economy corresponds to the differencebetween domesticsavings and investment. Ifdomesticsavings are greater than the level ofinvestment in a given period, this is reflectedin a current account surplus when seen inforeign trading terms; and a “savings gap”,i.e. a surplus of investment over domesticsavings, is accompanied by a current accountdeficit in foreign trading terms.
In the intertemporal model approach the
positive or negative financial balances vis-bWOOq-vis non-residents are explained as the resultof an economic utility maximisation calcula-tion over a specified period. The rate of timepreference and the productivity of an econ-omy as well as the interest rate represent im-portant variables. For example, an economywhich is inclined to value consumption possi-bilities in the present higher than consump-tion possibilities in the future (high rate oftime preference) will tend to prefer, all otherthings being equal, relatively low levels ofsavings and therefore larger current accountdeficits than an economy with a lower timepreference. Only if productivity is sufficientlyhigh, however, is it attractive for investors tofinance the corresponding transfer of re-sources from abroad. The market interest ratetakes over the function of ensuring a trade-
off between these two factors.
The theoretical basis of the intertemporal ab-
sorption approach to explaining internationalcurrent account differences over time hasbeen given detailed treatment in a number ofpapers over the years.
2A central theme of
these works consists in portraying on a micro-economic basis sustainable savings and in-vestment relationships or optimal consump-tion paths taking due account of the relevantvariables.
The intertemporal approach is applied with
various objectives in empirical analyses of thecurrent account.
3For example, a number of
works attempt to derive from it informationon the sustainability of external positions inan effort to make a better assessment of thesuitability of current account balances andcorresponding exchange rate movements.
4
However, structural or balanced current ac-count positions of that kind cannot be estab-lished without normative assumptions. That isparticularly true of the intertemporal macro-economic utility functions and rates of timepreferences that have to be assumed in theprocess. In the concrete empirical estimating

57approaches this mostly means taking account
of saving ratios, interest rates and productiv-ity levels as well as the terms of trade or realexchange rates. Judging from past experi-ence, this gives rise to collinearity problemswhich also impair the informative value of theempirical tests.
The empirical analysis carried out here (a de-
tailed account of which appears in the annex)has an objective similar to that of the inter-temporal approaches mentioned above to es-tablish structural current account deficits;however, it is based on the simple absorptionapproach, and its purpose is to obtain a refer-ence variable from the data which makes itpossible to distinguish more easily betweentemporary and permanent changes in thecurrent account.
The econometric analyses first confirm the
theoretical considerations, described above,on the long-term interaction of the variablesin the simple absorption approach. Over thelong term an improvement in the terms oftrade and an increase in domestic absorption,which, by way of approximation, was meas-ured on the basis of the German GDP, willhave a negative effect on the export-importratio. By contrast, there is a positive relation-ship between the foreign absorption illus-trated by the GDP of 18 industrial countriesand net exports. The magnitude of the esti-mated elasticities seems plausible comparedwith values which were established in separ-ate estimates of export and import functionson previous occasions.
5A deterioration of
1% in the terms of trade would, if examinedon its own, be reflected in a 0.7% improve-ment in the export-import ratio. Given the
decidedly negative change in the terms oftrade during the past two years (a deterior-ation of 11.7 % in the terms of trade was re-corded in November 2000 compared with thebeginning of 1999), the short-term restrain-ing effects of the deterioration in the terms oftrade therefore predominate in the currentdata on lower net exports in 1999 and 2000.Another factor is the upturn in domesticgrowth, which has been working in the samedirection. According to the estimates, a 1%increase in GDP would result in the long termin a deterioration of approximately 2.1% inthe export-import ratio. This is counteractedby the positive forces emanating from the im-provement in the world economy – the cor-responding long-term elasticity of the export-import ratio has been estimated to be 1.6.
The long-term interactions in the current ac-
count trend are obscured by short-term dis-turbances and the adjustments that thesecause. To estimate structural current accountbalances from the established function it istherefore necessary to eliminate the tempor-ary fluctuations in the determinants of cur-rent transactions with non-residents that

58have arisen for cyclical or other reasons.6The
long-term trends in the terms of trade and inthe German GDP and that of 18 major indus-trial countries that were established in thisway can then be used along with the coeffi-cients of the long-term relationship previouslyestimated in the empirical analysis to calcu-late structural current account positions eventhough these, as mentioned at the begin-ning, refer only to goods and services transac-tions in the narrower sense and exclude fac-tor payments and unrequited transfer pay-ments.
The results are shown graphically in the chart
above. Significant shifts have occurred in thestructural component over time, for example,in connection with German reunification. Thelarge surpluses achieved in the eighties canno longer be used to the same extent as a
measure of the longer-term external trendsas they could previously. On the other hand,this representation also shows that the export-import ratio around the mid-nineties movedlargely in line with the structural componentand that the pronounced deterioration in theGerman current account during the past twoyears is likely to be of a temporary nature. Atleast the deviation of the present externalposition from the general downward trendindicates this. Owing to the methodologyused, however, it is implicitly implied that thestructural interactions identified in the pastmay still be valid at the current end of thetime series.
Summary and conclusions
The changes in the relative prices of exports
and imports and the growth rate differentialsvis-bWOOq-vis the rest of the world are clearly re-flected in the trend in the German current ac-count. Despite radical changes in the under-lying macroeconomic conditions associatedwith German reunification, this fundamentalcause-and-effect pattern appears to have re-mained fairly stable over the past 25 years.The recent depreciation of the euro togetherwith the very steep rise in oil prices have re-

6This is done here by means of non-parametrictrend es-
timates. To be more precise, the German GDP, the rest-
of-world GDP and the terms of trade were adjusted to
eliminate transitory fluctuations using a Hodrick-Prescott
filter ( l= 1600). To take account of the inaccuracies of
the two-sided HP filter at the data end-points the sample
used for determining the trend components was supple-
mented by historical data up to the first quarter of 1970
and at the current end by data available as well as by
forecasts and by extrapolating the time series up to the
fourth quarter of 2006.Results

59sulted in a serious deterioration in the terms
of trade, the restraining effects of which onthe current account in the short term are ob-scuring the positive stimuli that are beingexerted by the favourable economic trendabroad. At all events, estimates of the struc-tural current account balance show that thesizeable deficits in 1999 and 2000 are short-term deviations from the general trend likethe ones that have occurred every now and
again over the past 25 years. There is there-fore reason to expect that the current ac-count deficits will again decline once theseshort-term effects have abated. The results ofthe analysis also show a tendency towards animprovement in the structural current ac-count position.
Annex
Empirical analysis ofthe simple absorption
approach: explanatory notes on the methodand data used
Real net exports (NX) were measured in terms of
the ratio of real exports to real imports of goodsand services,
7domesticabsorption (A) in terms of
the real German GDP and foreign absorption (AF)
in terms of the combined real GDP of the 18 mostimportant industrial countries for the German busi-ness sector. The terms of trade (P) were calculatedon the basis of the export and import prices ofgoods and services. The data used are the season-ally adjusted quarterly figures for the period fromthe first quarter of 1976 to the third quarter of1999. Where necessary as a result of the dataquality, a shift adjustment was carried out in thecase of the German time series for the changeoverto the new definition of “Germany” in connectionwith German reunification; this also enabled ac-count to be taken of the data break that arosefrom the change to the new European System ofAccounts (ESA 95).The degree of integration of the variables was
checked using ADF tests. The variables proved tobe non-stationary in levels but stationary in firstdifferences. Whether cointegration relationshipsexist between these variables was tested on thebasis of a vector error correction model (VECM),which had the following general form:
(2)Dz
t=Pzt-1+k-1SGiDzt-i+ut.
i=1
where z is a vector of the non-stationary endogen-
ous variables nx, p, a and aF.
The disturbance term u ton the right-hand side of
equation (2) was assumed to be independentlyand identically normally distributed. The secondexpression contains information on the short-termmomentum. The optimum lag structure k, whichwas applied, was derived by means of an unre-stricted vector autoregression and has the value 4.An impulse dummy variable was included in theshort-term relationship in order to take account of

60the changeover to figures relating to the whole of
Germany as a result of reunification.8The values of
the dummy variable (d) are 0.25 and 0.5 for thethird and fourth quarters of 1990, respectively, and1 starting from the first quarter of 1991; prior tothese periods it had been set at zero. The first termon the right-hand side, the matrix P, stands for
the cointegration space spanned between the vari-ables. The method chosen to estimate the modelfollows the approach developed by Johansen andJuselius.
9A constant (c) is assumed in the long-
term relationship. The number of existing cointe-gration vectors was then tested and was found tobe 1. It was therefore possible to break the matrixPdown into a vector bwith the coefficients of the
cointegration relationship and a vector awith the
loading coefficients. Restrictions to these vectorswere set in later steps in order to identify the fea-tures of the long-term relationship more accurate-ly. The domesticabsorption, the external absorp-tion and the terms of trade each proved to beslightly exogenous with respect to net exports(p-value: 0.84). The model was again estimatedtaking these restrictions into account in order toimprove the statistical quality.
A long-term equilibrium relationship could be iden-
tified between the variables. With a significanterror correction term of – 0.686 net exports adjustquite rapidly to this equilibrium described by thecointegration vector. By contrast, the other threevariables did not prove to be endogenous to themodel used and can be considered as explanatoryEstimation results

61variables for net exports. To that extent, the esti-
mated model provides empirical evidence for thetheoretical considerations of the simple absorptionapproach.
The plus and minus signs in front of the estimated
coefficients in the cointegration relationship are inline with the theoretical considerations cited at thebeginning. The coefficients in the long-term rela-tionship are significant in the case of an error prob-ability of 5%. The results are also stable aroundthe time of German reunification. A recursive esti-mate was carried out from the first quarter of
1987 to ascertain if there had been a structuralbreak. Only a few of the coefficients proved to besignificant in the short-term momentum. As onlythe long-term equilibrium relationship is of interestwhen determining structural current account pos-itions, the short-term momentum was not ana-lysed more closely. Its sole purpose as far as themethod used here is concerned was to provide aclearer definition of the coefficients of the cointe-gration relationship.
