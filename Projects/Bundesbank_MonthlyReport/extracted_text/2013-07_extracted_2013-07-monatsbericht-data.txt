Commentaries
Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Following a weak start to the year owing to 
adverse weather conditions, the current eco -
nomic indicators confirm the assessment that 
the German economy expanded strongly dur -
ing the second quarter of 2013. Although in 
May the indicators mostly declined somewhat 
on the month in seasonally adjusted terms, 
bridge- day effects played a substantial role in 
this development. Industry and the construc -
tion sector probably made important contribu -
tions to growth during the second quarter. 
Output losses recorded during the first quarter 
were quickly offset.
For the third quarter, there are increasing signs 
of a slowdown in economic growth, which is in 
line with the underlying cyclical trend. The 
orders for April and May did not provide any 
notable impulses for industry. Enterprises’ re -
cruitment plans were also cautious. On the 
positive side, according to the Ifo surveys, en -
terprises are looking to the future with some -
what more confidence again. This applies to 
their business activity in the coming six months 
as well as to their export expectations.
Industry
In May, industrial output was down by a sea -
sonally adjusted ¾% on the high level recorded 
in April. The large number of bank holidays and 
bridge days in May this year is likely to have 
played a role in this decline. On an average of 
April and May, industrial output exceeded the 
first quarter level by 2¼%. Producers of capital 
goods recorded a particularly steep increase 
(4½%), which was due primarily to the high 
level of production in the automotive industry. 
Manufacturers of intermediate goods con -
tinued to record slight growth (+¾%), while consumer goods production remained virtually 
unchanged.
In line with higher output levels, industry saw a 
marked rise in sales in the first two months of 
the second quarter, compared with the first 
quarter (1½% after seasonal adjustment). While 
sales for both Germany and the euro area re -
mained at more or less the same level as during 
the first quarter, sales in countries outside the 
euro area increased by 5%.
Exports fell in May by a seasonally adjusted 
2½% on the month. On an average of April 
and May, exports remained on a par with the 
first quarter. By contrast, imports were up by 
1¾% in May compared with April. The level of 
imports in April and May combined exceeded 
the average figure for the first quarter by 1½%. 
The marked decline in import prices means that 
the increase was even sharper in real terms.
The volume of new orders received by German 
industry in May was 1¼% down on the month 
in seasonally adjusted terms. This was predom -
inantly due to the subdued ordering activity in 
other transport equipment. If this economic 
sector is excluded from the calculation, the vol -
ume of new orders in May matched the figure 
for April. On an average of April and May, the 
overall figure was ½% below the average vol -
ume of orders for the previous quarter. Exclud -
ing other transport equipment, however, the 
figure for the first quarter was exceeded by 
¾%. Other capital goods (+½%), intermediate 
goods (+¼%) and consumer goods (+4¾%) all 
contributed to this rise.
The volume of domestic orders in April and 
May was distinctly lower than the figure re -
corded for the first quarter (-2¼% after sea -
sonal adjustment). During the same period, ex -
port orders increased by ¾%. Orders from 
countries outside the euro area rose by 2½%,

by 2% excluding other transport equipment, 
but fell by 2¼% if this economic sector is in -
cluded in the calculation.
Construction
In May, construction output fell by 2½% in sea -
sonally adjusted terms, following the strong re -
covery in April. Taking the average of April and 
May, construction output rose by 3% com -
pared with the weak previous quarter (which 
was due to adverse weather conditions). While 
activities in the main construction sector in 
April and May far exceeded the first quarter fig -
ures in seasonally adjusted terms, and returned 
to the level recorded in the third quarter of 
2012, provisional figures indicate that the fin -
ishing trades saw a 3¾% decline on the first 
quarter. New orders in the main construction 
sector in April (more recent data are not yet 
available) fell slightly compared with the aver -
age figure for the previous quarter.
Labour market
The situation on the labour market hardly 
changed in the months of April and May. The 
seasonally adjusted number of persons in work 
in Germany in May rose by only 7,000, follow -
ing a sideways movement in April. A year- on- 
year comparison nonetheless again shows a 
significant increase of 246,000, or 0.6%. Ac -
cording to an initial estimate, regular jobs sub -
ject to social security contributions recorded a 
marked increase of 47,000 in seasonally ad -
justed terms in April following a decline in 
March, which was also weather related. In 
year- on- year terms, the rise amounted 
to 373,000, or 1.3%. The forward- looking indi -
cators provide evidence that enterprises’ will -
ingness to recruit new staff is restrained. The 
Ifo employment barometer fell considerably in 
June and is now only slightly expansionary. The 
Federal Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index 
stabilised during the second quarter following 
a long period of decline.Decline in

The number of persons registered as un -
employed fell in June by a seasonally adjusted 
12,000. This was not quite enough to offset 
the marked rise in the previous month. The un -
employment rate (using the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s definition) remained unchanged 
in June vis-  à- vis the revised figure of 6.8% for 
May. The number of unemployed persons was 
up by 56,000 on the year.
Prices
The price for a barrel of Brent crude oil in June 
virtually matched the figure for the previous 
month (+¼%). However, the price of oil rose 
considerably at the beginning of July owing to 
the political crisis in Egypt and lower oil pro -
duction in the OPEC countries. As this report 
went to press, the price stood at US$108¾. 
The discount on crude oil futures increased to 
US$3¼ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$6¾ 12 months ahead.
Prices at the upstream stages of the economy 
continued to decline in May. Import prices 
were down by 0.4% on the month in May in 
seasonally adjusted terms and domestic produ -
cer prices fell by 0.3%. Energy in particular was 
cheaper both in terms of imports and at the 
producer level. As prices had also seen a 
marked drop during the same month of the 
previous year, the year- on- year change for im -
ports fell to -2.9% (compared with -3.2% in 
April), while at the producer level the year- on- 
year increase rose slightly from 0.1% to 0.2%.
Consumer prices in June increased by a season -
ally adjusted 0.2% on the month. Food prices 
in particular once again rose quite steeply 
owing to the weather, but the prices of ser -
vices, especially package holidays, also in -
creased considerably. By contrast, the prices of 
industrial goods and energy remained virtually 
unchanged. The annual rate of consumer infla -
tion went up from 1.5% to 1.8% according to 
the national CPI and from 1.6% to 1.9% as 
measured by the HICP .Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the cash statistics data from the 
Federal Statistical Office for the first quarter of 
2013, the local government budget deficit 
(core budgets and off-  budget entities) fell by 
€½ billion on the year to €4½ billion. This im -
provement is attributable to the significant rise 
in revenue (6½%, or €2½ billion). Tax revenue 
continued to record dynamic growth (+7½%, 
or €1 billion), which was driven, in particular, 
by higher local business tax receipts (+10½% 
after deduction of the revenue shares accruing 
to other government levels). Payments from 
state government rose by 5½% (or €1 billion), 
as the federal states increased their general 
grants and passed on more central government 
funds to local authorities. Expenditure also 
went up considerably (by 4%, or €2 billion). 
Spending on personnel (+5½%) and social 
benefits (+6%) recorded particularly strong 
growth. The increase in personnel expenditure 
is attributable to the rise of 1.4% in negotiated 
pay rates at the beginning of 2013 and the im -
pact of the wage increase in the first stage of 
the 2012 agreement (3.5%), which did not af -
fect cash flows until the spring of that year. The 
rise in expenditure on social benefits was due 
not least to increased spending on accommo -
dation for the long-  term unemployed (+7½%) 
as well as on social assistance (+5%). Growth in 
other operating expenditure was somewhat 
weaker but still significant (+3½%). By contrast, 
fixed asset formation, in particular, declined 
(-4%).
According to the tax estimate, tax revenue is 
expected to rise less sharply during the remain -
der of 2013. However, growth in transfers from 
state government will probably become Unemployment

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of

stronger (partly because of central govern -
ment’s increased contribution to the basic al -
lowance for the elderly). The easing achieved 
through the municipal debt relief and consoli -
dation funds set up by some federal states is 
also likely to play a role. Despite the additional 
expenditure on the horizon, not least in the 
areas of social benefits, personnel (also owing 
to a further negotiated wage increase of 1.4% 
in August) and other operating expenditure, 
the expected additional revenue should gener -
ate marked growth in the surplus for 2013 as a 
whole (2012: €1 billion).
The debt level of local government core 
budgets and off-  budget entities (including debt 
to general government) at the end of March 
was only slightly higher than the level recorded 
at the end of 2012 (€139 billion) despite the 
marked deficit at the beginning of 2013. While 
debt to general government fell by €1 billion 
and credit market debt also decreased slightly, 
cash advances, which are actually only in -tended to bridge short-  term liquidity shortfalls, 
continued to expand robustly (climbing by al -
most €2 billion to €49½ billion). Once again, 
this growth was particularly strong in those 
federal states that already had high outstand -
ing cash advances per capita . North Rhine-   
Westphalia alone reported an overall increase 
of €1½ billion in cash advances, while Saarland 
and Rhineland-  Palatinate also recorded further 
rises. By contrast, Lower Saxony and Hesse 
posted moderate declines, which appear to be 
linked to state government debt relief pro -
grammes. In these federal states, the budget -
ary position of local government is likely to re -
main strained overall. Having said that, there 
are probably large differences between individ -
ual local authorities in these states too.
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
In the first quarter of 2013, the statutory health 
insurance institutions and the health insurance 
fund recorded a combined deficit of just under 
€1 billion, compared with a surplus of €½ bil -
lion one year previously. This deterioration is 
attributable in almost equal measure to the 
statutory health insurance institutions, whose 
surplus fell from €1½ billion to just under €1 
billion, and the health insurance fund, whose 
deficit climbed from just over €1 billion to close 
to €2 billion. In consolidated terms, revenue in -
creased by 1½%, but expenditure rose at a sig -
nificantly faster pace (4½%).
The statutory health insurance institutions’ rev -
enue was up by 3% on the year in the first 
quarter. While transfers from the health insur -
ance fund – their main source of revenue – 
rose by 3½%, almost no additional contribu -
tions (which would flow directly to the health 
insurance institutions) were charged by individ -
ual institutions. By contrast, expenditure grew 
at a significantly faster pace (4½%). This is pri -
marily due to the abolition of the surgery visit 
charge, while spending on pharmaceuticals 
only rose by just under ½% and outlays on hos -… but situation

pital treatment, which is the most important 
area of expenditure in quantitative terms, re -
corded relatively weak growth (2½%). As in 
previous years, the increase in the statutory 
health insurance institutions’ expenditure fell 
short of the estimates made the autumn before 
(estimate for 2013 as a whole: +5½%), on 
which the transfers from the health insurance 
fund were based. The fact that expenditure 
was also significantly overestimated for the 
base year 2012 amplifies the situation.
The health insurance fund’s expenditure (pri -
marily comprising transfers to the statutory 
health insurance institutions) increased by 3½% 
in the first quarter. By contrast, its revenue 
went up by only 2% on the year. However, the 
associated rise in the deficit – which is often 
seen in the first quarter – was not due to weak 
growth in contribution receipts. They actually 
rose at a faster pace (just over 3½%) than had 
been forecast in the key autumn 2012 esti -
mates (just under 3%). Rather, the crucial fac -
tor was the cut in the central government grant 
from €14 billion to €11.5 billion for the year as 
a whole, which resulted in a decline in revenue 
of just over €½ billion in the first quarter.
The statutory health insurance system appears 
likely to record another surplus for 2013 as a 
whole, even though the official estimators pre -
dicted a slight deficit for the health insurance 
fund and a balanced result for the health insur -
ance institutions in their autumn 2012 esti -
mate. The official estimators assumed that the 
transfers from the health insurance fund would 
just suffice to cover the statutory health insur -
ance institutions’ expenditure (including add -
itional outlays stemming from the abolition of 
the surgery visit charge) and that the health in -
surance fund itself would post a deficit of just 
over €½ billion. It now seems more likely that 
the health insurance fund will record a surplus, 
in particular as a result of employment de -
veloping more favourably than expected. How -
ever, the statutory health insurance institutions 
will probably post a higher surplus, owing to 
their expenditure being overestimated. Overall, however, the combined surplus of the statutory 
health insurance institutions and the health in -
surance fund is likely to be significantly lower 
than the final figure of €9 billion recorded for 
2012.
The central government grant has been re -
duced by €2.5 billion this year and a further cut 
of €1 billion to €10.5 billion is planned for 
2014. The current plans envisage central gov -
ernment funds being put back up to €14 billion 
(the figure prescribed by law for the long term) 
in 2015. However, past experience would sug -
gest that there is a danger of central govern -
ment’s budget requirements dictating the ac -
tual size of the central government grant in the 
coming years. To avoid using health insurance 
contributions to fund tasks facing society as a 
whole or subsidising insurance- related benefits 
with tax revenue, it would be useful to base 
the size of the central government grant on a 
clearly defined catalogue of non- insurance-  
related benefits. A sustainable structural con -Health insurance

cannot be achieved through temporary cuts in 
the central government grants.
Securities markets
Bond market
Gross issuance in the German bond market 
stood at €133.3 billion in May 2013, which was 
slightly down on the previous month’s €140.3 
billion. After deducting redemptions (€124.9 
billion), which likewise declined, and after tak -
ing account of changes in issuers’ holdings of 
their own bonds, domestic debt securities 
worth €2.9 billion net were redeemed. The 
outstanding amount of foreign debt securities 
in Germany increased by €19.8 billion during 
the month under review, with the result that 
the total volume of debt instruments in the 
German market went up by €16.9 billion.In May, the public sector issued debt securities 
worth €6.5 billion net (compared with €4.0 bil -
lion in April). Central government was the sole 
issuer of new debt instruments (€8.8 billion 
net), mainly placing five- year Federal notes 
(Bobls) to the value of €4.8 billion but also 
two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) in 
the amount of €4.4 billion. It also stepped up 
the outstanding volume of Federal Treasury dis -
count paper (Bubills) by €2.1 billion. This con -
trasted with net redemptions of ten- year Bunds 
totalling €4.6 billion while the state govern -
ments redeemed a net €2.3 billion of their own 
bonds.
Domestic enterprises issued corporate bonds 
with a net value of €0.4 billion in the reporting 
month, compared with a net €2.5 billion one 
month earlier. On balance, these were solely 
debt instruments running for terms of less than 
one year. In net terms, only non- financial cor -
porations issued new bonds, whereas other 
 financial institutions reduced their capital mar -
ket debt.
Domestic credit institutions redeemed €9.8 bil -
lion of their own bonds in May, compared with 
€5.5 billion in April. This primarily reduced the 
outstanding amount of debt securities issued 
by specialised credit institutions, which include 
public promotional banks, for example (€5.6 
billion). The month of May also saw net re -
demptions of public Pfandbriefe (€2.0 billion) 
and mortgage Pfandbriefe (€1.7 billion).
Foreign investors were the main buyers of 
bonds in May (€15.0 billion). Domestic invest -
ors added interest- bearing paper worth a net 
€1.9 billion to their portfolios, offloading do -
mestic paper (-€17.9 billion) in favour of foreign 
debt securities (+€19.8 billion). Domestic inter -
est- bearing securities were sold chiefly by Ger -
man credit institutions (-€10.3 billion).Higher net

net in the German equity market. This issuance 
activity is attributable to capital increases by 
two enterprises. The volume of foreign equities 
in the German market increased by €5.1 billion 
over the same period. On balance, shares were 
purchased chiefly by foreign investors (€13.9 
billion) but domestic non- banks were likewise 
active in the market (€7.5 billion). Domestic 
credit institutions, meanwhile, offloaded shares 
with a net worth of €10.7 billion.
Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€2.2 billion in May (April: €7.5 billion). On bal -
ance, these inflows mainly accrued to special -
ised funds reserved for institutional investors 
(€1.7 billion). Mixed securities- based funds 
 accounted for almost all of the new mutual 
fund shares sold by fund providers (€2.1 bil -
lion). The volume of foreign mutual fund units 
traded in Germany rose by €2.4 billion in the 
reporting month. Foreign investors were the 
sole buyers of mutual fund shares in May (€5.6 
billion), while domestic non- banks offloaded 
mutual fund shares worth a net €1.1 billion. 
These were exclusively domestic mutual fund 
shares on balance. Domestic credit institutions 
played only a marginal role in the market over -
all.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €11.2 billion in 
May 2013. The result was €5.5 billion down on 
the level of the previous month and was pri -
marily due to the lower trade surplus. This was 
accompanied by a widenening of the deficit in 
invisibles, which comprise services, income and 
current transfers.Equity issuance

According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in May the foreign 
trade surplus went down by €4.9 billion on the 
month to €13.1 billion. After adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar variations, it decreased 
by €3.5 billion to €14.1 billion. The value of ex -
ports went down by 2.4%, while the value of 
imports increased by 1.7%. In seasonally ad -
justed terms, the combined export figures for 
April and May were broadly unchanged com -
pared with their average level in the first quar -
ter. By contrast, imports rose sharply. Moreover, 
prices of imported goods fell by a perceptibly 
greater margin than those for exports.
April’s €0.2 billion deficit in invisible current 
transactions widened to stand at €0.9 billion in 
May, mainly on account of the shift in the ser -
vices sub- account from a surplus of €0.8 billion 
in the preceding month to a deficit of €0.4 bil -
lion. This downward movement was largely at -
tributable to increased spending on travel and 
was only partially offset by developments in 
other sub- accounts. The deficit in current trans -
fers contracted by €0.5 billion to €2.1 billion 
and net cross- border income held steady at its 
April level of €1.6 billion.
In May, Germany’s cross-  border portfolio in -
vestment resulted in net capital imports of €8.7 
billion, after generating outflows in April 
amounting to €39.9 billion. Uncertainties about 
the evolution of bond purchases in the United 
States and the future yield path, for instance in 
Japan, contributed to this shift. The net in -
crease of €35.6 billion in foreign portfolio in -
vestment in Germany in May (compared with a 
decrease of €32.8 billion in April) played a par -
ticularly strong role in this regard. Non- resident 
investors acquired not just debt securities 
(€15.0 billion), chiefly bonds issued by the pub -
lic sector, but also shares (€14.9 billion) and 
mutual fund shares (€5.6 billion). With respect 
to purchases of shares, buybacks of sales that are traditionally executed ahead of dividend 
payment dates are also likely to have played a 
part. Resident investors purchased foreign se -
curities with a total value of €26.9 billion in the 
reporting period. In the main, they added debt 
securities (€19.8 billion) to their portfolios, with 
a particular preference for euro- denominated 
longer- term financial instruments (€16 billion). 
In addition, these investors acquired both 
shares (€4.7 billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€2.4 billion).
In May, direct investment resulted in moderate 
net capital exports (€0.8 billion, compared with 
€3.1 billion in April). This outflow of funds 
arose from the fact that foreign firms withdrew 
more funds from their German affiliates (€6.5 
billion) than, conversely, German firms did from 
their subsidiaries abroad (€5.6 billion). To this 
end, German direct investors, in particular, 
made predominant use of intra- group credit 
transactions.
In other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other assets, Germany saw net cap -
ital outflows of €16.6 billion in May. The activ -
ities of enterprises and households led to net 
capital exports in the amount of €3.3 billion, 
while general government transactions resulted 
in outflows totalling €0.7 billion. The German 
banking system’s external position rose by 
€12.7 billion as a result of transactions. Here, 
net capital exports by credit institutions (€19.7 
billion) were a key contributory factor, with re -
demptions of liabilities from short- term finan -
cial loans (€32.2 billion) playing a crucial role. 
By contrast, the Bundesbank’s net external 
assets fell by €7.0 billion

European Single Supervisory Mechanism  
for banks – a first step on the road to a 
banking union
The current financial crisis has exposed flaws in the architecture of banking supervision in the euro 
area. To solve this problem, a fundamental political decision was taken in 2012 to transfer exten -
sive supervisory tasks and powers, including the right to take sovereign measures, to the Euro -
pean level.
The European Council and the European Parliament have since reached a consensus on a regu -
lation establishing a European Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). This will confer extensive 
supervisory powers on the European Central Bank (ECB); the SSM itself will comprise the ECB and 
the national supervisory authorities of the euro- area countries. EU member states outside the 
euro area are entitled to opt into the SSM.
The distribution of tasks within the SSM depends on whether an institution is classified as signifi -
cant or less significant; the ECB will have direct supervisory powers over significant institutions, 
receiving assistance from national authorities in verification activities and the preparation of deci -
sions. For less significant institutions, by contrast, these powers will lie primarily with national 
authorities, although they must be exercised in accordance with the ECB’s general instructions. In 
addition, the national authorities will be represented on the SSM’s boards, panels and commit -
tees.
The SSM is only one component of the banking union; another key pillar will be a Single Reso -
lution Mechanism (SRM) establishing uniform rules and procedures for the resolution of banks. 
Work has already begun on these components of the banking union, too.
Although the banking union cannot solve the current crisis, it can play a valuable role in making 
crises less likely in the future. To achieve this, it is important to establish effective governance 
structures, a clear- cut separation between monetary policy and prudential tasks and a sound 
legal basis for the new framework. Ongoing work on the banking union should therefore also 
involve examining the legal basis of the SSM and investigating potential improvements.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background to the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism
Motivation for creating a 
banking union
After its onset in 2007, the global financial crisis 
exposed a whole range of flaws in the institu -
tional and economic architecture of European 
economic and monetary union (EMU). In the 
early years of the single currency, investors 
made less of a distinction between the euro-  
area countries and among the different bank -
ing sectors than they had before the euro was 
launched. This development was reflected, not 
least, in narrowing yield spreads between euro- 
area government bonds and a shrinking gap 
between money market and capital market 
rates. The onset of the crisis reversed this trend 
and led to growing concerns that the euro- area 
money and capital markets would become 
fragmented again.
The crisis revealed a fatal negative feedback 
loop between public finances and banking sys -
tems. Doubts about the soundness of bank bal -
ance sheets prompted governments to bail 
out  systemically important institutions. This 
worsened the fiscal positions of these coun -
tries, which, in turn, put pressure on the profit -
ability and solvency of domestic banks through 
the wide-  ranging ties they share with the fi -
nances of their home governments, eg via gov -
ernment bond holdings.1 Government bond 
downgrades influenced how investors per -
ceived the risks affecting national banking sys -
tems, while the woes of these banking systems 
also became a burden for the single monetary 
policy.
In view of the significant links among Europe’s 
credit institutions and given the cross- border 
effects of banking crises, a banking union with 
European- level supervision as one of its key pil -
lars may prove especially useful in a monetary 
union, as the SSM should ideally benefit from a 
broader perspective which extends beyond na -
tional borders. More effective and transparent cross- border supervision of banking groups 
could allow risks to the financial system to be 
identified at an earlier stage and counter 
“home bias”, ie the tendency for supervisors to 
be more lenient with certain banks because 
they are embedded in their national perspec -
tive.
The European Commission2 therefore launched 
an initiative to set up a “banking union” to 
achieve further integration among the national 
banking sectors and thus complete the project 
of monetary union. This banking union will 
need to take account of the unique circum -
stances in Europe’s monetary union – notably 
the sovereignty of the member states over 
many policy areas, some of which are import -
ant to financial stability, the danger of conflicts 
of interest (particularly with monetary policy 
goals), and requirements under EU primary law, 
which will place certain constraints on the insti -
tutional structure of the banking union. The 
proposed legislation on the banking union also 
reflects efforts to accommodate these circum -
stances.
The “four presidents”3 developed this concept 
further in a dedicated report, and the project 
was endorsed at the highest political level 
– that of the heads of state or government – at 
the European Council’s June 2012 summit. The 
summit statement called on the European Link between 
public finances and bank bal-ance sheets …
… prompted 
calls for a euro-area banking union
… and posed 
the danger of a “home bias” among national supervisors1 For more information on the negative feedback loop be -
tween bank balance sheets and government bonds, see,

Staatsschuldenkrise ”, speech by Bundesbank President Dr

union” of 6 June 2012 and the speech held by the Presi -
dent of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Bar -
roso, at the European Policy Centre in Brussels on 26 June 
2012. Both the memo and the speech already include the 
term “banking union”. The term “financial market union” 
was also used occasionally at an earlier stage in the discus -
sions; it appears to be broader in scope than “banking 
union” but is now used much less often in practice.

Commission to present proposals for a Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) on the basis of 
Article 127 (6) of the Treaty on the Functioning 
of the European Union (TFEU) and asked the 
Council to consider these proposals as a matter 
of urgency by the end of 2012. Once an effect -
ive SSM has been established, the European 
Stability Mechanism (ESM) is to be given the 
possibility to recapitalise banks directly (bypass -
ing the indirect route of an ESM loan to their 
home country, which would then have to put 
together a rescue programme).
Procedure
The Commission put the conclusion of the 
summit into action and presented a package of 
legislative proposals on 12  September 2012, 
comprising a regulation giving strong powers 
for the supervision of banks to the ECB on the 
basis of Article 127 (6) of the TFEU and a regu -
lation reforming the European Banking Author -
ity (EBA), which adapts the regulation estab -
lishing the EBA to the new supervisory frame -
work.
The trialogue between the Council, the Com -
mission and the European Parliament4 involved 
a critical evaluation of whether taking Article 
127 (6) of the TFEU as the legal basis for trans -
ferring supervisory powers to the ECB would 
offer a viable long- term solution. In the course 
of this process, a third, separate document was 
added to the legislative package: a declaration 
by the member states that they were ready to 
work constructively on a proposal for “treaty 
change” (to amend EU primary law). However, 
this is a political commitment and is not legally 
binding.
The Council approved the compromise reached 
through the trialogue at the meeting of the 
Permanent Representatives Committee on 
18 April 2013. This did not constitute a formal 
decision; the legal opinion of Germany’s gov -
erning coalition – based on a ruling by the Fed -
eral Constitutional Court5 – is that Germany’s permanent representative on the Council may 
only approve the SSM Regulation once he has 
been authorised to do so by legislation passed 
with a two- thirds majority by the Bundestag 
and the Bundesrat. The relevant draft legisla -
tion6 was ratified by the Bundestag on 13 June 
2013 and by the Bundesrat on 5  July 2013, 
clearing the way –  under German constitu -
tional law – for a formal decision by the Coun -
cil. The European Parliament’s final vote on the 
two regulation proposals is scheduled for 
10  September 2013. Although the legislative 
procedure is not yet complete and the wording 
of the regulation proposals therefore still needs 
to be finalised, extensive changes to the pro -
posals are unlikely given the political consensus 
among the institutions involved.
Description and explanation 
of the regulation proposals
Technical and geographical 
scope of the SSM
In principle, the ECB will assume overall respon -
sibility for supervising the banking system of 
the SSM member states. However, the SSM’s Two regulation 
proposals from September 2012 …
… were 
amended and a political declar-ation added to the legislative package
Compromise 
 already reached but further pro-cedural steps  required before the regulations come into force4 There was no legal requirement to reach a consensus 
with the Parliament, as Article 127 (6) of the TFEU stipu -
lates the use of a special legislative procedure which does 
not accord the Parliament decision- making rights (which it 
would usually possess in the EU legislative process), merely 
stipulating that the Parliament must be consulted. How -
ever, Article 114 of the TFEU, which was taken as the legal 
basis for the amendments to the EBA regulation that were 
negotiated in parallel, requires the use of the ordinary legis -
lative procedure, which stipulates that the consent of the 
European Parliament must be obtained. Given that the sub -
ject matter of the two regulations is related, and in the 
interests of democratic legitimacy, the Parliament already 
presented its assessment of both regulation proposals dur -
ing the negotiation process and insisted that the two docu -
ments be considered in parallel.
5 Primarily, the Federal Constitutional Court’s “Lisbon rul -
ing” of 30 June 2009, which declared Germany’s ratifica -
tion of the Lisbon Treaty to be constitutional and imposed 
conditions for the transfer of further powers to the Euro -
pean level (BVerfGE 123, 267). This legal opinion is some -
what controversial; in a hearing on 5 June 2013 before the 
Bundestag Committee on the Affairs of the European 
Union, doubts were raised over the need for national legis -
lation approving an EU regulation.

supervisory remit will generally only extend to 
banks classified as a deposit- taking credit insti -
tution under EU law, ie an undertaking whose 
business is to receive deposits or other repay -
able funds from the public and to grant credits 
for its own account. Consequently, national au -
thorities will retain sole responsibility for super -
vising entities classified as credit institutions 
under national law but not under EU law. This 
will be of particular relevance for Germany, as 
the German Banking Act ( Gesetz über das Kre -
ditwesen ) defines credit institutions much more 
broadly than EU legislation. Similarly, the pro -
posed SSM legislation distinguishes between 
national and EU law in the specific business ac -
tivities of a credit institution; the ECB will only 
be responsible for monitoring the application 
of EU law and national legislation which trans -
poses EU directives or exercises the options for 
member states that are granted in EU regula -
tions. Competence for monitoring compliance 
with regulatory requirements founded solely in 
autonomous national law will remain with the 
national supervisory authorities. In Germany 
this will apply, for example, to the Pfandbrief 
Act (Pfandbriefgesetz ), the legal provisions on 
significant loans to managers and the sphere of 
central counterparties (CCPs) in securities and 
derivatives business (expressly mentioned in 
Article 1 (2)). However, the tasks conferred on 
the ECB essentially cover the entire spectrum of 
material rules relating to the prudential supervi -
sion of credit institutions, which have recently 
been additionally harmonised through the EU 
legislation implementing Basel III (CRR/CRD IV7).
As it is envisioned as an addition to EMU, the 
SSM’s geographical scope will cover the entire 
euro area. EU member states outside the euro 
area are entitled to opt into the SSM. Article 78 
provides for the possibility of establishing close 
cooperation between the ECB and the national 
supervisory authority of an EU member state 
seeking to join the SSM, rendering this country 
a “participating member state” (Article 2 (1)) – 
a term used frequently in the SSM Regulation 
to define the geographical scope of the SSM. 
This close cooperation can be terminated either by the member state or, if the country does not 
adequately implement the ECB’s measures, by 
the ECB.
Yet the SSM will also have implications for 
countries outside its supervisory remit. As the 
SSM Regulation designates the ECB as the 
“competent authority” for banking supervision, 
it will also perform the tasks of the “competent 
authority” in relations with non-  SSM countries 
(see, for example, Article 4 (1) letter g and (2)). 
This will mainly affect participation in cross-  
border supervisory colleges.
Distribution of tasks  
between the ECB and national 
authorities within the SSM
Although the ECB will, in principle, be broadly 
responsible for supervising credit institutions in 
the SSM countries, it will not perform all of the 
tasks covered by the SSM Regulation directly 
itself. Instead, the SSM will be composed of the 
ECB and the national supervisory authorities 
and founded on the principles of cooperation 
and decentralisation. This network of existing 
institutions will have a similar structure to the 
Eurosystem (comprising the ECB and the na -
tional central banks of the euro- area countries). 
In terms of the institutions involved, there is a 
substantial overlap between the Eurosystem 
and the SSM: the national central banks in 11 
of the 17 euro- area countries are also respon -
sible for banking supervision.
The ECB will be exclusively responsible for all 
supervisory tasks listed in Article 4 (1) in relation 
to all credit institutions established in SSM 
member states – albeit within the framework 
of Article 6. This proviso means that the ECB SSM’s supervis-
ory remit will only extend to credit institu-tions under EU definition and activities gov-erned by EU law

will not perform all of these supervisory tasks 
for all banks itself; instead, the tasks will be div -
ided between the ECB and the national super -
visory authorities. As a result, only institutions 
classified as “significant” will be supervised by 
the ECB directly. For “less significant” institu -
tions, by contrast, these tasks will fall under the 
remit of national authorities (Article 6 (6)). This 
will include responsibility for ensuring compli -
ance with regulatory requirements. However, 
national supervisors will not be fully autono -
mous in this respect; the ECB will exercise over -
sight over the system as a whole and will be 
responsible for ensuring high- quality, harmon -
ised supervision throughout the euro area by 
issuing regulations, guidelines or general in -
structions to national supervisory authorities.
Institutions will be classified as significant or 
less significant according to pre- defined criteria 
regarding their size, economic importance and 
the importance of their cross- border activities. 
Specifically, an institution will be considered 
significant if any of the following conditions is 
met:
– the total value of its assets exceeds €30 bil -
lion or – unless the total value of its assets is 
below €5 billion – exceeds 20% of national 
GDP;
– it is a recipient of direct assistance from the 
EFSF or the ESM;
– it is one of the three most significant credit 
institutions established in an SSM member 
state.
Only one of these criteria needs to be met for 
an institution to be classified as significant. The 
criteria will be applied at the highest level of 
consolidation within the SSM member states; 
consequently, if a group of credit institutions 
reaches the threshold at the consolidated level, 
its banking subsidiaries and branches will also 
be considered significant even if they do not 
exceed the significance threshold on their own.
The division of tasks between the ECB and the 
national supervisory authorities will be guided by this distinction between significant and less 
significant institutions. The ECB will perform 
the tasks listed in Article 4 (1) – which include 
sovereign powers – for significant credit institu -
tions; in effect, these tasks will cover the entire 
spectrum of supervisory activities. In addition, 
the ECB will have comprehensive data collec -
tion and verification powers in accordance with 
Articles 10 to 13 (requests for information from 
legal or natural persons, general investigations, 
on- site inspections). However, this does not 
mean that national authorities will cease all of 
their supervisory activities for these institutions. 
Faced with the challenge of creating a func -
tioning supervisory mechanism from scratch 
within the ECB, it is both reasonable and ne -
cessary to use the existing resources and ex -
pertise of national supervisors – which will also 
allow the SSM to draw on a pool of in- depth 
knowledge about the specific legal and actual 
circumstances in each of its member states. 
There are tentative plans to establish joint 
supervisory teams for each significant bank or 
banking group, composed of staff from the 
ECB and the national supervisory authorities 
who are in permanent contact with each other. 
This would enable national authorities to con -
tribute, for example, to verification activities or 
data analysis concerning significant institutions 
even though the responsibility for issuing sov -
ereign, supervisory measures will lie with the 
ECB.
The ECB will also be entitled, on its own initia -
tive, to classify a specific institution involved in 
cross- border activities as significant even if it 
does not fulfil the significance criteria, thus 
drawing additional institutions into its direct 
supervisory remit. The ECB’s powers under Art -
icles 10 to 13 (requests for information, general 
investigations, on- site inspections) also apply to 
less significant institutions subject to national 
supervision (Article 6 (5) letter d). The chart on

national and European levels when implement -
ing and applying supervisory measures.
Most of the provisions in the SSM Regulation 
which assign the ECB powers over banks also 
explicitly extend their scope to all credit institu -
tions in the SSM countries. Given the division 
of tasks envisaged in the regulation, however, 
the ECB will only exercise its powers over less 
significant banks if the applicable criteria in the 
regulation are fulfilled.
Aside from its aforementioned general right to 
issue instructions, the ECB is not authorised to 
address instructions to national supervisory au -
thorities concerning specific cases. However, it 
is unclear whether the regulation accords the 
ECB a general right of intervention which 
would also allow it – instead of the national 
authorities, which are actually responsible for 
such activities – to issue and implement meas -
ures for specific cases involving less significant 
institutions at any time. Article 6 (5) letter b 
specifies that the ECB may decide to exercise 
“all the relevant powers” over less significant 
banks itself where this is necessary to ensure a 
consistent application of high supervisory 
standards, which could be interpreted as a 
legal basis for such a right of intervention. Al -
ternatively, “all the relevant powers” could also 
be understood to mean that, if the ECB chose to make use of this option, it would then have 
to exercise all powers over that institution itself 
in the future and would not be allowed to sim -
ply intervene on a case- by- case basis in the na -
tional authorities’ ongoing supervisory work. 
This interpretation would render this provision 
no more than an additional option, alongside 
Article 6 (4) subparagraph 3 but subject to dif -
ferent conditions, allowing the ECB to take 
over full responsibility for supervising an institu -
tion that had previously fallen under the remit 
of the national authority. Nonetheless, this in -
terpretation is of great significance in practice, 
where it is important to have clear lines of 
competence and responsibility for supervisory 
activities. This can only be ensured if the ECB is 
not permitted to issue specific instructions re -
garding less significant banks.

Ways for the ECB to institute supervisory legal acts
In its new role as a supervisory authority, 
the ECB will have powers of administrative 
intervention. This move by European regu-
lators into uncharted waters was forced by 
the absence of harmonised European ad-
ministrative legislation. The ECB will essen-
tially have a choice of three procedures: dir-
ectly exercising its own powers, applying 
national legislation and instructing national 
authorities to institute supervisory legal 
acts.
The ECB will have numerous instruments 
directly at its disposal to fulfi  l and discharge 
its tasks. Article 16 (2), in particular, pro-
vides a comprehensive catalogue of 
powers:1 the ECB may order an institution 
which it supervises directly to hold add-itional own funds for uncovered risk or to present a plan to restore compliance with 
supervisory requirements. It can, moreover, 
prescribe a specifi  c provisioning policy or treatment of assets and require an institu-tion to restrict or limit certain business  activities or sell off activities that pose 
 excessive risks to the soundness of the insti-
tution. The ECB can also restrict variable 
 remuneration to a certain percentage of net 
revenues if this remuneration is incompat-
ible with maintaining a sound capital base. 
Moreover, it can order an institution to  reinvest net profi  ts to strengthen its own 
funds and restrict or prohibit profi  t distribu-
tion altogether. In addition, the ECB can  impose more frequent and additional 
 reporting requirements and specifi  c liquidity  requirements. It can also remove managers who fail to comply with supervisory require-ments.
The provisions established in Article 4 (3) of 
the SSM Regulation are very unusual in 
European law. What is new is that, in order to circumvent the issue of directives not 
being directly applicable in the member 
states, a European body will be required to implement national law – ie, national legis-
lation transposing EU directives. The appli-
cation of national legislation by the ECB is 
likely to cause considerable practical prob-
lems since EU directives, despite all efforts 
at harmonisation, often allow member 
states options and scope to take account of national peculiarities, which the ECB would 
then likewise have to observe. In order to make effective use of this possibility, the ECB would therefore need to be familiar with a large number of national legal sys-
tems, including the relevant administrative 
legislation. Moreover, appeals against supervisory measures taken by the ECB could only be submitted to the European Court of Justice, which would have to 
examine the legality of a measure not just 
under European law but also – against its 
usual practice – under national law. Admit-tedly, these problems are likely to come up in everyday practice only where this involves 
supervisory measures not included in the 
extensive catalogue of powers envisaged in 
1 The scope of these powers, especially the question 
of whether they are limited to signifi  cant institutions 
supervised directly by the ECB or are applicable to all 
credit institutions, is not entirely clear. The former in-
terpretation is supported by the chain of references 
from Article 16 (1) to Article 4 (1) and from there to the 
framework pursuant to Article 6, which is currently 
being developed with this interpretation in mind. This 
understanding of the ECB’s powers is consistent with 
the principle in the SSM Regulation of distinguishing 
between signifi  cant and less signifi  cant institutions 
with regard to the scope of the ECB’s activities. On the 
other hand, Article 16 (1) states that the measures listed therein can be directed at “any credit institu-
tion”. As a result, the possibility of these powers being applied to all banks in future practice cannot be ruled 
out entirely even though this is not the intention underlying the work at present. This would upgrade 
the ECB’s role to the substantial detriment of national authorities.Deutsche Bundesbank

the CRR and the SSM Regulation that are 
directly applicable under European law.
In some cases, the ECB will also be given 
the power to issue instructions to national 
supervisory authorities. With respect to sig-
nifi  cant fi  nancial institutions, which will be 
supervised directly by the ECB, the SSM 
Regulation invests the ECB with a right to 
issue instructions. Unlike in the case of less signifi  cant banks, the wording of the regu-
lation does not restrict this entitlement to 
general matters, and it therefore also in-
cludes the right to issue specifi  c instructions 
(third subparagraph of Article 9 (1)). Al-
though the ECB has direct powers over 
those banks which it supervises directly, the 
right to issue specifi  c instructions gives the 
ECB the additional option of a two- stage supervisory procedure: the ECB issues in-structions to national supervisors under 
European law and, in order to comply with 
these instructions, national authorities im-
pose measures on credit institutions under 
national law.
The application and implementation of 
supervisory legislation will not be restricted to the imposition of a supervisory measure, ie a supervisory legal act (under German ad-
ministrative law, which is applicable to 
BaFin, this usually takes the form of an ad-
ministrative act pursuant to section 35 of 
the Act on Administrative Procedures (Ver-
waltungsverfahrensgesetz), whereas under 
European law – as applied by the ECB – it 
will be a decision under Article 288 (4) of 
the Treaty on the Functioning of the Euro-
pean Union (TFEU)). Compliance with an adopted supervisory legal act must be en-forced, where necessary, through legal channels. In addition, the SSM Regulation 
empowers the ECB to impose sanctions for 
non- compliance: under Article 18, it may 
punish breaches by imposing administrative 
penalties of up to twice the amount of profi  ts enabled by the breach or up to 10% of the total annual turnover. Alternatively, it 
may instruct national authorities to open penalty proceedings pursuant to national 
law – in Germany, this would mean, in par-
ticular, the laws governing administrative offences (Ordnungswidrigkeiten). National 
supervisors can impose sanctions not only 
on a credit institution itself as a legal person but also on any natural persons responsible for the breaches. However, should enforce-ment measures turn out to be necessary be-cause other methods have failed to ensure 
compliance with legal requirements, the 
ECB will inevitably have to enlist the assis-
tance of national supervisors and, where necessary, other national authorities; the 
European institutions do not have their own 
fully developed set of enforcement mech-anisms. In that vein, Article 12 (5) of the SSM Regulation explicitly requires national authorities to assist the ECB by imposing 
enforcement measures pursuant to national law with regard to on- site inspections.Deutsche Bundesbank

Applications for authorisation to conduct bank -
ing business must be made to the national 
competent authority, which then assesses com -
pliance with national legislation and, if the out -
come is positive, submits a draft decision to the 
ECB within a nationally defined timeframe as to 
whether or not to grant authorisation. A “no 
objection” approach applies: the decision to 
grant authorisation is deemed adopted unless 
the ECB objects to the proposal of the national 
authority. Nonetheless, the issue of authorisa -
tion is considered an ECB act.
The draft regulation contains two ways of re -
voking authorisation. The ECB may withdraw 
authorisation on its own initiative; in this case, 
it must consult the national authority. Alterna -
tively, the national competent authority may 
make a proposal to have authorisation revoked. 
Even then, however, the final decision on 
whether or not to withdraw the authorisation 
rests with the ECB.
For the transitional period until a harmonised 
European bank recovery and resolution regime 
enters into force, a special rule will apply (Art -
icle 14 (6)): as long as responsibility for bank 
resolution remains at the national level, the na -
tional authority may invoke a deferring veto 
against the ECB’s plan to withdraw a bank’s 
authorisation in cases where this would jeop -
ardise financial stability. This is intended to win 
time in which to take measures to protect fi -
nancial stability (which may include bank reso -
lution). The length of the deferral is not laid 
down in the regulation itself, but is agreed be -
tween the ECB and the national authority.
Institutional provisions
One of the greatest challenges for the SSM is 
integrating the ECB’s new supervisory powers 
into its existing governance structure. Regula -
tors recognised the danger of mutually exclu -
sive goals and conflicts of interest between 
banking supervision and monetary policy. A 
central bank with supervisory responsibility could, for instance, be tempted to provide li -
quidity in response to the problems of the 
banks it supervises. This would, however, con -
flict with the objective of price stability. Based 
on such considerations, the SSM Regulation 
(recitals 65 and 73 and Article 25, for instance) 
stresses the need for a full and strict separation 
of the two policy areas.
To this end, the units that are responsible for 
the two policy areas are to be separated by 
Chinese walls within the ECB. ECB staff en -
trusted with supervisory tasks may not exercise 
any monetary policy functions and must be or -
ganised in separate reporting lines and chains 
of command.
The SSM centres around a newly established 
Supervisory Board which is to “fully” undertake 
the planning and execution of the supervisory 
tasks conferred on the ECB. This includes pre -
paring supervisory legal acts, which are submit -
ted to the Governing Council of the ECB for 
approval (Article 26). This body has a full- time 
Chair and a Vice- Chair, who are appointed by 
the Council of the EU (member states not par -
ticipating in the SSM have no voting rights) fol -
lowing a proposal by the ECB and with the 
agreement of the European Parliament; the 
Chair is chosen in an open selection procedure 
from the ranks of external candidates (ie not 
from among the members of the ECB Govern -
ing Council) with recognised expertise in bank -
ing and financial matters, while the Vice- Chair 
must be chosen from among the members of 
the ECB’s Executive Board. In addition, there 
will be four ECB representatives appointed by 
the ECB’s Governing Council and one represen -
tative from each of the national supervisory au -
thorities of the participating member states. 
The Supervisory Board takes decisions on the 
basis of a simple majority of its members or, 
where directly applicable regulations are to be 
issued (the ECB has the authority to institute 
such legislation), with a weighted voting in line 
with the voting rules for a qualified majority on Member states 
retain deferring veto against withdrawal of authorisation as long as they  remain compe-tent to resolve credit institu-tions

the Council of the EU.9 For states where the 
authority competent to issue supervisory legal 
acts is not the national central bank but a sep -
arate supervisory authority – as is the case in 
Germany  – the SSM Regulation provides the 
option of dispatching representatives of both 
institutions to the Supervisory Board, who are 
then considered as one member for voting pur -
poses and thus exercise a joint voting right.10 
This allows the time- tested division of labour 
between the Federal Financial Supervisory Au -
thority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank to be main -
tained at the European level and both institu -
tions’ specific expertise to be incorporated into 
the process.
Pursuant to Article 26 (10), a Steering Commit -
tee is set up from among the members of the 
Supervisory Board. This committee, which has 
no decision- making powers of its own, pre -
pares Supervisory Board decisions. It is headed 
by the Chair of the Supervisory Board and com -
prises up to ten members, of which no more than seven shall be representatives of the na -
tional competent authorities. The representa -
tives of the national supervisory authorities are 
to rotate in an as yet unspecified process.
The mediation panel described in Article 25 (5) 
is another instrument intended to ensure the 
separation of monetary policy and supervision. 
It will be made up of one member per partici -
pating member state, with the member state 
free to dispatch its central bank governor 
–  who is a member of the ECB Governing 
Council – or its representative on the Supervis -
ory Board to the Mediation Panel.
The Mediation Panel is being set up to resolve 
the following dilemma. Although the two pol -
icy areas need to be separated all the way up 
to the decision- making level in order to avoid 
conflicting objectives between supervision and 
monetary policy, at the same time the applic -
able European primary law does not allow for 
such an institutional separation: according to 
the ESCB Statute, which ranks as primary law, 
the ECB Governing Council is the ECB’s su -
preme decision- making body, and there is no 
provision for a differentiation between policy 
areas. The SSM Regulation, as an element of 
secondary law, cannot override the fact, stipu -
lated in the statute, that final responsibility 
rests with the ECB Governing Council. The 
Supervisory Board cannot therefore be 
equipped with its own decision- making powers 
in the place of the ECB Governing Council. An -
other problem associated with the ECB Gov -
erning Council having the final say is that only

9 Following the accession of Croatia on 1 July 2013, Ger -
many controls 29 of 352 votes in the Council, which gives 
it a weight of roughly 8.2%. Its weight in the ECB’s Super -
visory Board is different, as states not participating in the 
SSM are not represented and the four ECB representatives 
receive voting rights equal to the median vote of the other 
members and the relative percentage of votes controlled 
by member states’ representatives is correspondingly lower 
(Article 26 (7) sentence 2).
10 Article 26 (1) second subparagraph of the SSM Regula -
tion. This rule differs from the corresponding passage of 
the EBA Regulation (Article 40 (4) and (5)), which states 
that the supervisory authority has the right to vote on the 
Board of Supervisors, as the EBA’s highest decision- making 
body, while the central bank may participate in meetings 
but has no voting rights.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

member states who have adopted the euro 
have voting rights there under the applicable 
treaties. If the Governing Council were to per -
form supervisory tasks itself, non- euro states 
would therefore not be able to opt in and par -
ticipate in the SSM on an equal footing.
In order to defuse this dilemma, a “no objec -
tion” procedure was developed for decision-  
making processes in the SSM. The Supervisory 
Board draws up draft decisions, which it sub -
mits to the Governing Council for approval. 
Provided the latter raises no objections within a 
period to be defined later, the draft is con -
sidered to have been accepted; in other words, 
silence from the Governing Council is inter -
preted as approval. This procedure is an at -
tempt at a compromise between the Govern -
ing Council’s ultimate decision- making powers, 
on the one hand, and the need to transfer 
supervisory issues to a separate body outside of 
the Governing Council with other voting rules, 
on the other hand. If the Governing Council 
raises objections to a draft decision put for -
ward by the Supervisory Board, the member 
states in question can apply to the Mediation 
Panel to settle the difference of opinion. The 
panel’s decisions are taken by simple majority. 
The wording of the SSM Regulation does not 
explicitly rule out the interpretation that the 
Mediation Panel ultimately overrides the Gov -
erning Council; that would, however, not be 
compatible with higher-  ranking EU law. The 
ECB Governing Council has the final say, as out -
lined above, and cannot, therefore, be bound 
by the Mediation Panel.
Another new body that is to be created by the 
SSM Regulation (Article 24) is an Administrative 
Board of Review. This is because the ECB, as a 
sovereign supervisor, will be granted the au -
thority to impose measures that directly inter -
fere with the rights of private entities – primarily 
banks, to whom supervisory acts are addressed. 
This raises the issue of legal protection. A five-  
strong board of external individuals, ie not staff 
of the ECB or national supervisory authorities, 
will be created; any natural or legal person may request that this panel review a supervisory de -
cision by the ECB. The conditions under which 
this application is admissible (the act must be of 
direct and individual concern to the applicant) 
are modelled on those for legal challenges be -
fore the European Court of Justice (ECJ), and 
the existence of this Board of Review does not 
preclude the option of applying to the ECJ for 
legal protection. The benchmark for this new 
remedy encompasses procedural issues as well 
as material legality.
Elaboration on the 
 requirements set out in the 
SSM Regulation
The operational work to prepare the SSM is in 
full swing. Since the summer of last year, repre -
sentatives of the ECB and the national supervis -
ory authorities have, in various committees and 
working groups, been jointly developing the 
structure and processes of the SSM, which are 
essentially to be specified in an ECB framework 
regulation. A central aspect of this work is re -
solving how to organise daily supervision within 
the SSM. The SSM Regulation only sets out a 
rough framework: joint supervisory teams 
headed by the ECB are to be responsible for 
operational supervision of those banks that fall 
under the direct oversight of the ECB. Staff of 
the ECB and the national supervisory author -
ities will cooperate within these supervisory 
teams and undertake ongoing supervision of 
the significant institutions within the SSM. 
Supervision of less significant banks will be ex -
ercised by the national supervisory authorities 
based on the general supervisory guidelines 
and general instructions of the ECB.
When drawing up the details of this supervis -
ory model, care must be taken to ensure that 
there is a distinct division of responsibilities be -
tween the ECB and the national supervisory au -
thorities, and that clear processes for cooper -
ation are defined. Procedural reasons alone 
make this crucial, as does the need to ensure 
the necessary legal certainty for the SSM’s Administrative 
Board of ReviewExact proced-ures in day- to- 
day practice still need to be  specified in greater detail …

supervisory actions. From a practical viewpoint, 
a duplication of work has to be avoided as do 
supervisory gaps. Moreover, the SSM’s govern -
ing principle as a decentralised and cooperative 
supervisory system should be reflected in an 
appropriate involvement of the national super -
visory authorities. The SSM is reliant on the ex -
perience and expertise these authorities have 
gathered over many decades. At the same 
time, it is hoped that the SSM’s international 
outlook will prevent national considerations 
from playing an inappropriate role in assess -
ments.
Accountability and budget
European primary law gives the ECB far-  
reaching independence in fulfilling its tasks, 
without differentiating by the nature of the ac -
tivity in question – monetary policy or banking 
supervision. However, institutional independ -
ence in the sense of freedom from external in -
structions has to go hand in hand with ac -
countability to the public in order to lend 
democratic legitimacy to the actions that the 
central bank takes in fulfilling its tasks, which 
includes supervision.11 On top of the ECB’s ac -
countability in terms of its tasks within the 
ESCB and the Eurosystem, which is laid out in 
primary legislation, the SSM Regulation expli -
citly states that it must hold itself to account to 
the European Parliament and the Council of the 
EU in relation to its supervisory tasks.
The ECB is to fulfil this duty primarily by pre -
senting a report on its prudential supervisory 
activities once a year, which will be sent to the 
above- mentioned institutions as well as the 
European Commission, the Eurogroup and the 
national parliaments of the participating mem -
ber states.
In addition, the European Parliament has the 
right to summon the Chair of the Supervisory 
Board to hearings of the competent parliamen -
tary committees; the Parliament and the Euro -
group may, moreover, send the ECB written questions on its supervisory activities, which 
the ECB is obliged to answer. Where informa -
tion is confidential, the European Parliament 
can demand that the Chair of the Supervisory 
Board of the ECB hold confidential oral discus -
sions “behind closed doors” with the chair of 
the competent parliamentary committee.
National parliaments, too, can submit written 
questions to the ECB on its supervisory activ -
ities or invite members of the Supervisory Board 
to an exchange of views. The ECB is not, how -
ever, obliged to comply with their requests – 
unlike those of the European Parliament. This is 
without prejudice to the accountability of na -
tional supervisory authorities to their parlia -
ments in accordance with national law.12
Supervisory activities will not be financed out of 
the ECB’s general budget, which would, 
through the ECB’s profit distribution mechan -
ism, take place at the expense of its sharehold -
ers, ie the national central banks, and thus ul -
timately the member states’ budgets. Instead, 
the ECB will collect supervisory fees from the 
relevant credit institutions based on their signifi -
cance and their risk profile according to the cost 
recovery principle. The national supervisory au -
thorities retain their right to levy national fees to 
fund their respective activities. Spending on 
banking supervision will be shown separately in 
the ECB’s budget.

editorial adjustments to the wording, the polit -
ical compromise agreed upon goes further and 
specifies that substantial changes are also to be 
made to the powers and decision- making pro -
cesses of the EBA.
The powers of the EBA vis- à- vis credit institu -
tions in stress tests are, for instance, to be ex -
panded. While the EBA has, to date, usually 
received the data necessary for stress tests 
from the competent supervisory authorities, it 
can now collect them directly from the institu -
tions. Outside of stress tests, too, the EBA can 
now gather information directly from credit in -
stitutions, and even from unregulated units 
within a financial group or a conglomerate, 
where the information provided by the compe -
tent supervisory authorities is insufficient. 
Moreover, the EBA is now explicitly given the 
responsibility of developing a supervisory man -
ual which is to provide a guideline for day- to- 
day supervisory practice – both at the ECB and 
national authorities.
Noteworthy changes have been made to the 
EBA’s internal decision- making processes as 
well. National authorities will continue to be 
voting members in the top EBA decision-  
making body, the Board of Supervisors. The 
same applies to states participating in the SSM; 
in other words, the ECB is still only represented 
by one non- voting member and does not bun -
dle the voting rights of the SSM states. There 
will, however, be adjustments to the voting 
modalities: while a qualified majority in the 
sense of the voting rules in the European Coun -
cil has to date been sufficient to take decisions 
on the most important issues – binding tech -
nical standards, budgetary matters and the 
temporary ban on certain financial activities – a 
simple majority of those EU member states par -
ticipating in SSM and another simple majority 
of those not participating will, in future, also be 
required to agree. This concept is referred to as 
double majority.Assessment of the consensus 
reached
Fundamental assessment 
of the SSM as part of the 
 comprehensive project  
of banking union
Establishing a Single Supervisory Mechanism as 
part of a banking union marks a turning point 
in Europe’s financial market architecture. Al -
though a number of questions remain un -
answered, and notwithstanding some criticism 
of details, it represents a decisive step towards 
strengthening financial stability and the institu -
tional framework of monetary union: given the 
close financial ties among European credit insti -
tutions and the cross- border effects of banking 
crises, it makes sense increasingly to exercise 
banking supervision at a cross- border level. 
Such a mechanism, operating on the basis of 
more comprehensive information and with the 
benefit of cross- border comparisons, will en -
able risks which threaten, or emanate from, the 
banking system to be identified more easily and 
at an earlier stage. It will remove the incentive 
to be lenient with banks out of national consid -
erations, which also creates risks for other 
member states. However, a binding single 
supervisory mechanism for all EU member 
states would be desirable with a view to achiev -
ing a truly European regime of prudential 
supervision which encompasses the entire sin -
gle market and under which European legisla -
tors adopt supervisory legal acts for banks.
A consistent institutional framework needs to 
be in place to prevent future problems. The 
SSM, which should – and, following the agree -
ments in the European Council of June 2012, 
will – represent an important precondition for a 
potential communitisation of risk via the direct 
recapitalisation of banks by the ESM, is not suf -
ficient on its own, however. To ensure that in -
vestors first and foremost bear the risk of their 
investment decisions (bail- in), work is ongoing 
on a material harmonisation of the national 
resolution regimes of all EU member states in EBA powers to 
be extended to allow it to ap-proach credit in-stitutions directly

the form of the Bank Recovery and Resolution 
Directive (BRRD). In addition, the SSM needs a 
European counterpart for restructuring and 
resolution. The SSM needs to be expanded to 
include a restructuring and resolution mechan -
ism, as liability and control will otherwise di -
verge. The European Commission’s draft regu -
lation on establishing a Single Resolution 
Mechanism (SRM) was presented in July 2013.
The transition to the SSM and the SRM raises 
issues regarding intertemporal and cross- border 
burden- sharing if, for example, banks’ balance 
sheets already contain impaired assets which 
will require future write- downs. These risks, 
which can vary widely from country to country, 
arose on the watch of national supervisors al -
though they may materialise only after the 
launch of the SSM. Communitising the fiscal li -
ability for these legacy assets would therefore 
be a form of redistribution. The political deci -
sion to give the ESM the power to directly re -
capitalise banks once the SSM has been estab -
lished also adds to the scale of this problem.
Before supervisory powers are transferred to 
the ECB, these legacy assets should therefore 
be identified and then eliminated or secured 
through a comprehensive balance sheet review 
for at least the significant institutions, or better 
still, all institutions. This is the only way to en -
sure that even if these risks materialise after the 
SSM has been established, their consequences 
are borne by the member states under whose 
watch they arose. The fact that the SSM Regu -
lation envisages this type of balance sheet re -
view is therefore to be welcomed. Possible ap -
proaches are currently being developed. Be -
cause the planning and implementation of this 
project is highly complex and involves a large 
workload, it poses a major challenge to the 
ECB and the national supervisory authorities. 
Impartial third parties (eg external auditors) 
should play a significant role in the assessment.
In addition to the single supervisory mechanism 
and an effective restructuring and resolution 
mechanism, regulatory measures should also be taken in the medium term to prevent banks 
from taking on excessive risk through the finan -
cing of governments. These include own fund 
requirements for government bonds in accord -
ance with the risks involved and a ceiling on 
lending to governments. This may also help to 
loosen the ties between public finances and 
bank balance sheets which proved so harmful 
during the crisis.
In the longer term, particular attention should 
be paid to the fact that the growing communi -
tisation of liability risks requires considerable 
progress in integrating fiscal and economic pol -
icy and the establishment of effective powers 
of control and intervention at the European 
level; otherwise, liability and control would be 
at odds with one another, creating a worrying 
incentive effect (moral hazard).
Evaluation of the institutional 
structure of the SSM itself
The draft regulation contains a number of use -
ful provisions in terms of the institutional struc -
ture of the SSM. In particular, the intended dif -
ferentiation between significant and less signifi -
cant institutions and the subsequent division of 
tasks between the ECB and national supervis -
ory authorities is to be welcomed. Although 
the threshold of €30 billion in assets for classi -
fying institutions as significant is somewhat low 
from Germany’s point of view, it is likely to 
have been difficult to reconcile the needs of 
the larger and smaller member states in this re -
gard.
The fact that the draft regulation keeps macro -
prudential policymaking at national level since 
the macroeconomic costs of a systemic crisis 
are likewise incurred at national level also 
 deserves support. However, the ECB is em -
powered to tighten up national macropruden -
tial policy. In view of the increasing communiti -
sation of risks in the euro area, it seems appro -
priate for a European institution to be able to 
intervene in macroprudential matters.Legacy debts

Tying the SSM in with macroprudential oversight
At the European level, macroprudential 
oversight is conducted by the European Sys-
temic Risk Board (ESRB). However, given 
that the various national fi  nancial systems in Europe are continuing to evolve in very different directions, it is important for  national authorities, too, to be able to 
 respond  appropriately to threats to the sta-
bility of their fi  nancial system by deploying 
suitable systemic instruments. The use and 
dosage of the appropriate instruments are 
recommended by the macroprudential au-
thorities or bodies responsible at national 
level. This task is performed in Germany by 
the Financial Stability Commission (Aus-
schuss für Finanzstabilität, hereinafter AFS), 
on which BaFin, the Bundesbank and the 
Federal Ministry of Finance are represented. With the introduction of the SSM, the ECB, 
too, will receive some macroprudential powers over the institutions in SSM mem-
ber states. However, as a general rule, the 
tasks and powers of the ESRB and the  national macroprudential authorities will  remain the same as before; the latter, in 
particular, will retain the option of deploy-
ing macroprudential instruments, such as capital buffers, at the national level. The ECB, with its systemic role, will join the 
existing institutional framework for macro-
prudential oversight as an additional entity 
which – unlike the ESRB and AFS – has not 
only non- binding but also binding instru-
ments in its toolkit. In general, the individ-
ual entities’ responsibilities can be outlined 
as follows. The ESRB will be responsible for 
macroprudential oversight over the entire 
fi  nancial system (eg banks, insurers and fi  -
nancial market infrastructures) in the EU member states. The ECB will supervise 
banking systems in the SSM member states, and will also be given the individual macro-
prudential powers set forth in Article 5 of the SSM Regulation. Under the European banking legislation known as CRR/CRD IV, 
the ECB will accordingly be able to tighten 
macroprudential measures, such as capital 
buffers, imposed by national authorities in 
their sovereign territory. The ECB will there-fore have to be notifi  ed of such measures in advance. National authorities with systemic 
mandates will continue to be in charge of 
macroprudential oversight in their respect-
ive country. The use of instruments at na-
tional level has to be coordinated with the 
ESRB if a signifi  cant cross- border impact is 
expected. This is a key “safety catch” to forestall the misuse of national discretion. 
Coordination between the ECB and the na-tional macroprudential authority (of an SSM member state) will additionally be necessary 
if there are plans to use an instrument 
which could, in theory, be used by both en-
tities. Coordination between the national 
authority and the ESRB will generally occur 
prior to coordination with the ECB. The 
ECB’s powers with respect to coordinating 
the use of macroprudential instruments are without prejudice to the ESRB’s mandate.Deutsche Bundesbank

The concept of joint supervisory teams, which 
is not included in the regulation itself, but 
emerged during the preparations for the super -
visory framework, fundamentally fulfils the re -
quirements outlined above for an effective div -
ision of tasks. The ECB has the final say on 
supervisory decisions affecting significant 
banks. Through their involvement in the super -
visory teams, the national supervisory author -
ities receive information that allows them to 
participate in decisions on the level of the Gov -
erning Council of the ECB and the Supervisory 
Board. In turn, the ECB needs to receive infor -
mation about the supervision of less significant 
institutions so that it can fulfil its overall super -
visory responsibility. However, this must be 
without prejudice to the clear division of tasks 
pursuant to the SSM Regulation, under which 
the majority of supervisory decision- making 
powers lie with the national supervisory au -
thorities. Giving the ECB the right to issue spe -
cific instructions to national supervisory author -
ities, for example, would not be in line with this 
principle. In any case, it must be ensured that 
the national supervisors can contribute their 
expertise and knowledge regarding certain 
markets and institutions, national and regional 
developments in the economy or individual 
sectors of the economy, and, not least, their 
national legal systems and administrative prac -
tices.
The heads of state or government have de -
cided to transfer extensive prudential supervis -
ory functions to the ECB on the basis of Article 
127 (6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union (TFEU).
It is not possible to separate monetary policy 
and banking supervision without amending the 
ECB’s institutional framework as enshrined in 
primary law. Although measures such as the es -
tablishment of the Supervisory Board and the 
mediation panel are aimed at separating these 
tasks, under the applicable treaties, the ECB 
Governing Council has the last word on bank -
ing supervisory decisions as a matter of prin -
ciple. The fact that the Governing Council can only accept or reject decision- making proposals 
from the Supervisory Board, but has no input 
into these proposals, does not contribute to 
good governance either. If the Governing 
Council is to bear responsibility for supervisory 
decisions, it has to be in a position to shape the 
measures being taken. The only arrangement in 
place at the level of the decision- making bodies 
to separate monetary policy from supervision is 
therefore the organisational principle according 
to which the Governing Council has to make 
banking supervisory and monetary policy deci -
sions at different meetings (Article 25 (4)). 
However, this separation is not strict enough to 
prevent conflicts of goals.
Finally, and in particular because the Governing 
Council bears ultimate responsibility, the prevail -
ing institutional framework leaves no room for 
non- euro- area member states to participate on 
an equal footing. Although the SSM Regulation 
grants these countries voting rights in the 
Supervisory Board and the mediation panel, pri -
mary law does not permit them to receive vot -
ing rights in the Governing Council, which is the 
body with ultimate responsibility. This reduces 
the incentive for the voluntary opt-  in which 
would be needed for broader participation in 
the SSM.
As a consequence, it would appear to make 
sense to amend EU primary law if banking 
supervision is to be fully Europeanised. The 
compromise reached, to base the SSM on art -
icle 127 (6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of 
the European Union, allows banking supervi -
sion at European level to be introduced swiftly 
on the basis of an existing legal framework. 
However, this legal basis has a number of dis -
advantages. Policymakers should therefore not 
leave the situation regarding the SSM as it is, 
but should amend the European treaties 
promptly to create a sound legal basis for Euro -
pean prudential supervision. This can be done 
either by reforming the institutional framework 
of the ECB or by enshrining a separate Euro -
pean banking supervisory authority in primary 
law. In any case, it must be ensured that the Mixed supervis-
ory teams are a good comprom-ise between pre-venting gaps and duplicating work

central bank’s primary mandate of preserving 
the independence of monetary policy and thus 
ensuring price stability is not jeopardised.
In addition to the SSM, a change to primary 
law should focus on the Single Resolution 
Mechanism (SRM), which is a necessary com -
plement to the SSM. Here, too, it is very doubt -
ful whether the current treaties provide a suffi -
ciently sound and institutionally consistent 
legal basis. Work should begin on making the 
necessary amendments to the treaties.
Evaluation of the relationship 
between the SSM and the EBA
The EBA can play an important cohesive role 
within the EU by coordinating activities be -
tween the member states participating in the 
SSM (the “ins”) and those not participating (the 
“outs”). It should be noted, though, that the 
political compromise also shifts the focus of the 
work performed by the EBA. While its work 
previously focused on regulatory issues, espe -
cially the development of binding technical 
standards, its powers now extend to oper -
ational supervisory activities. However, it should 
be assumed that, in practice, the ECB will en -
sure supervisory consistency in the area of the 
SSM and the task of the EBA will therefore be 
to focus on ensuring that supervision is consist -
ent between those member states participating 
in the SSM and the other EU member states. To 
avoid unnecessary duplication of work and fric -
tion between two different European author -
ities, an effort should be made to create a clear 
division of tasks and responsibilities between 
the ECB and the EBA.
The proposed changes to the EBA regulation do 
not preclude the risk of a crossover between 
the responsibilities of the EBA and the ECB. The 
EBA already has the authority to issue binding 
instructions to the competent authorities in cer -
tain cases.13 If its decision is disregarded, it can 
order the relevant credit institution to take the 
necessary measure directly, effectively bypassing the national supervisory authority. Whereas the 
original Commission draft of September 2012 
reduced the EBA’s powers over the ECB as a 
competent supervisory authority to a simple 
“comply or explain” procedure, the current 
compromise now gives the EBA the power to 
impose binding decisions on the ECB. This ap -
proach prevents the ECB from being treated dif -
ferently to the national supervisory authorities, 
especially those of the non- participating coun -
tries. However, it must not lead to the EBA be -
coming involved in the ECB’s day- to- day work.
The newly introduced double majority voting 
system in the Board of Supervisors may poten -
tially complicate or delay decision- making pro -
cesses in the EBA and lead to the increasing 
formation of two factions: between “ins” and 
“outs”. Because the non- participating states 
are smaller in number, population and eco -
nomic weight than the participating states, this 
procedure favours the “outs”. It is doubtful 
whether this unequal treatment of different 
categories of member states is compatible with 
fundamental democratic principles. Further -
more, it creates incentives not to participate in 
the SSM, thus contradicting the declared policy 
objective of achieving as broad a base of par -
ticipating countries as possible. In light of this, 
the double majority rule is most likely a political 
concession to individual member states to 
achieve the unanimity in the Council needed in 
order to adopt the SSM Regulation.
Further action needed and 
timetable before SSM is up 
and running

effect. The ECB is therefore expected – subject Clear division of

to the adoption of the regulation, which is still 
pending  – to assume its powers in autumn 
2014. However, this date may be postponed 
depending on the progress made with the pre -
paratory work and/or at the request of the ECB.
The entry into force of the SSM regulation, 
which marks the beginning of this transitional 
period, follows standard practice in European 
law. As such, the package must be formally 
adopted by the responsible bodies (only the 
Council in the case of the SSM Regulation, and 
both the Council and the European Parliament 
in the case of the EBA Regulation). The act will 
then be published in the Official Journal and 
the regulation will come into force five days 
later. This formal adoption has not yet taken 
place, but the date of the final vote in the Euro -
pean Parliament –  which is scheduled for 
10  September 2013  – gives an indication of 
when it is likely to happen.
At the unanimous request of the ESM, the ECB 
may already take over the supervision of indi -
vidual banks during the transitional period. This 
should also allow the short- term recapitalisa -
tion of banks through the ESM, if necessary. In 
June 2013, the Eurogroup decided that it 
should be possible to directly recapitalise banks 
through a subsidiary of the ESM as soon as a 
consensus is reached on the Bank Recovery 
and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the new 
Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive, under 
which shareholders and creditors are to make a 
sufficient contribution to sharing the burden. 
Moreover, the ECB can also already perform 
supervisory tasks for individual institutions, 
such as requesting information, for example, 
but is not permitted to adopt any supervisory 
decisions. In addition, the ECB must establish 
the organisational framework for its supervis -
ory activities during this period. This includes 
institutionalising SSM committees such as the 
Supervisory Board and the mediation panel, re -
cruiting staff and setting up IT and reporting 
systems. The aforementioned balance sheet 
evaluation is also supposed to take place dur -
ing this period.A number of questions about the cooperation 
arrangements between the ECB and the na -
tional supervisory authorities remain un -
answered in the SSM Regulation. The supervis -
ory framework provided for by article 6 (7), in 
which the ECB will set out details of the 
methods used to define significant and less sig -
nificant banks and the specific cooperation ar -
rangements between the ECB and national 
supervisory authorities, is therefore important. 
This framework will contain, for instance, de -
tailed explanations of the methods used to de -
fine significant institutions, the basic organisa -
tional and operational structure and decision-  
making mechanisms in the SSM, and will codify 
them in a binding manner. It will therefore be 
the key document in terms of cooperation on 
the SSM and is to be published within six 
months after the regulation has entered into 
force.
In addition to these internal preparations, the 
broader context in which the SSM operates 
needs to be developed further. Banking super -
visors can only ensure compliance with rules 
that have been imposed through banking 
supervisory legislation. Further progress should 
be made on the single rulebook, a set of har -
monised rules for the supervision of financial 
institutions throughout the EU, in order to har -
monise areas of legislation. The aforemen -
tioned CRR/CRD IV package is the most prom -
inent example of this. However, the single rule -
book goes much further and also includes dele -
gated legislation such as the Binding Technical 
Standards developed by the EBA.14
The SSM is only one of several components in 
the banking union project as a whole; the 
other components should be implemented 
promptly to avoid perpetuating the divide be -
tween liability and control. Responsibility for 
the resolution of a distressed bank should be 
located at the same level as control over super -
visory actions. The fact that banking resolution Regulation

regimes, which were previously regulated at 
national level, will shortly be harmonised by the 
BRRD is therefore to be encouraged, although 
the transitional period before the harmonised 
resolution tools come into force seems rather 
long.15 Furthermore, on 10 July 2013, the Euro -
pean Commission presented a draft regulation 
for the establishment of a Single Resolution 
Mechanism (SRM) with a European bank reso -
lution fund. This will now go through the legis -
lative procedure at European level, initially in 
the form of negotiations in Council working 
groups and the responsible committee of the 
European Parliament.
From time to time, there are calls for an add -
itional banking union component in the form 
of a common European deposit guarantee 
scheme (DGS). Although deposits must be pro -
tected effectively, a European DGS would be 
neither useful nor necessary in order to stabilise 
the monetary union in its current form. For 
many years, EU member states’ DGSs have 
been harmonised through legal acts16 which 
strike a balance between ensuring that a min -
imum standard is provided, on the one hand, 
and that the specific features of national bank -
ing systems are taken into account, on the 
other. In this respect, the Deposit Guarantee 
Schemes Directive is currently being amended 
to ensure that the rules on financing guarantee 
funds are also placed on a common basis for 
the first time. By contrast, Europeanisation that 
extended beyond harmonising deposit scheme legislation, such as the introduction of a single 
DGS fund, would have a redistributive effect 
which would require substantial fiscal and eco -
nomic policy intervention and control rights at 
European level (a fiscal union), requiring mem -
ber states to surrender sovereignty. It is doubt -
ful whether the political will to achieve this cur -
rently exists. For the time being, the areas of 
supervision and resolution should therefore be 
given priority over a European deposit guaran -
tee scheme, although the aim of improving the 
Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive should 
be pursued further. Implemented correctly, the 
SSM and the SRM could help to stabilise the 
financial markets and thus reduce the likeli -
hood of compensation events for depositors.
Despite the importance of establishing and im -
plementing the banking union quickly, and 
given the need for an effective SSM, overin -
flated or unrealistic expectations of the project 
should be avoided. A banking union cannot 
undo the past failures and mistakes which 
caused the present crisis. However, it may be a 
valuable tool for reducing the likelihood of fu -
ture financial crises and increasing the resili -
ence of the European financial market to 
shocks.DGS is not 
 currently a  priority

Estimating yield curves in the wake  
of the financial crisis
Yield curves capture the relationship between bond maturities and bond yields. They provide a 
whole range of information, such as insights into market participants’ growth and inflation 
expectations, and are therefore also relevant to monetary policy. Since the onset of the financial, 
banking and sovereign debt crisis, however, it has become more difficult to interpret yield curves, 
as factors such as liquidity risk or default risk are now having an increasing impact on yields. 
Against this backdrop, the following article comments on the results of methods that can be used 
to isolate a wide array of yield curve determinants. These include growth and inflation expect -
ations and term premiums which change over time, as well as influences stemming from the 
market structure, such as liquidity haircuts. These methods range from simply determining the 
differences between two yield curves to identify premiums which are contained in only one of the 
two curves to estimating affine term structure models with macroeconomic factors. The article 
finds that it is not always possible to clearly identify changes in inflation expectations or changes 
driven by liquidity or creditworthiness. However, the analytical tools it presents help to shed some 
light on developments in yield curves and their determinants. Yield curve models are therefore 
also a valuable point of departure for gaining a better understanding of monetary policy trans -
mission.Deutsche Bundesbank

Definition, determinants and 
monetary policy significance 
of yield curves
The bonds of an issuer with varying maturities 
are generally remunerated with different rates 
of interest. A yield curve is a graphical repre -
sentation of yields on bonds in relation to their 
residual maturity. Depending on the type of 
bond, the level and shape of a yield curve can 
be influenced by the rate of interest paid on 
alternative investments, expectations regarding 
future interest rates for shorter maturities as 
well as by the premiums that are paid to offset 
the risk of holding a bond over a certain period 
of time. Risk premiums to hedge against an un -
expected change in future short- term interest 
rates and unexpected inflation developments, 
but also the risk of a payment default and the 
possibility, or not, of being able to sell a bond 
at any time without the danger of influencing 
its market price,1 constitute maturity- specific 
components of bond yields. Furthermore, the 
interest rates for different maturities of a par -
ticular type of bond are also tied together in an 
arbitrage relationship, under which efficiently 
functioning markets can be expected to ensure 
that the relationship between interest rates 
across different maturities does not offer any 
scope for investors to pursue trading strategies 
designed to earn risk- free profits (arbitrage).
For benchmark securities, such as Federal 
bonds (Bunds), the Bundesbank (in addition to 
private information service providers) provides 
estimates of zero- coupon yields for a broad 
maturity spectrum. To determine these yields, a 
representative market- traded bond is first se -
lected for each maturity and its zero- coupon 
yield is calculated. The zero- coupon yield repre -
sents a bond’s total return, assuming that a 
one- off inpayment is made at the start of the 
bond’s term and a one- off outpayment at the 
end of its term. Any payments made during the 
maturity period (floating or fixed coupon pay -
ments) have to be factored into the difference 
between the purchase price and the redemp -
tion price. The zero- coupon yield therefore rep -resents a standardised indicator of a bond’s 
total return – irrespective of the existence, 
amount and frequency of a coupon. On the 
basis of a statistical financial model, these rep -
resentative zero- coupon yields can be used to 
estimate the relationship between bond yields 
and bond maturities.2 The resulting estimated 
continuous yield curve can then be used to de -
termine the zero- coupon yield for any given 
maturity.3
The relationship between bond yields and re -
sidual maturities illustrated by the yield curve 
varies over time. Historically, this curve has 
tended to slope upwards. On average, the yield 
curve for Federal securities was a steadily rising 
curve in the period from January 1999 to May 
2013, for example (see chart on page 35). The 
premium demanded for holding longer- term 
bonds compensates investors for the maturity 
risk they incur.
But yield curves sometimes have a different 
shape altogether. From 2006 up until the out -
break of the financial crisis, the yield curve was 
extremely flat, possibly because future short-  
term interest rates were expected to fall and 
because of an environment of low term pre -
miums. Back then, expectations that interest 
rates would be cut offset the term risk premium 
included in longer- term bond yields. Market 
participants’ expectations with regard to future 
interest rate developments are not the only in -
sights that can be gained from the yield curve. 
The literature also looks into the issue of divid -
ing interest rate expectations into inflation and 
growth expectations as well as the information Yield curves

content of the slope and changes in the slope 
of the yield curve for future macroeconomic 
developments (see section 2).
A yield curve can be used to depict more than 
just government bond yields. Other issuers also 
offer bonds with different maturities. Yield 
curves can be estimated for Pfandbriefe or KfW 
agency bonds, for example, but in these cases, 
the relationship between yields and maturities 
differs from that of Federal bonds primarily in 
terms of the credit default and/or liquidity pre -
miums. Given that Federal securities are 
deemed to be virtually default- proof and traded 
in a highly liquid market, the yield curve for 
Federal bonds lends itself as a suitable pricing 
benchmark for other securities and investments 
for which discount rates across different matur -
ities are required in order for them to be evalu -
ated. A comparison of the yield curves of vari -
ous bonds consequently allows risk premiums 
to be approximated. Comparing the yield 
curves of Federal securities and KfW bonds 
offers insights into liquidity premiums for differ -
ent maturities, for instance. Meanwhile, im -
plied inflation expectations and inflation risk 
premiums can be derived from the spread be -
tween nominal and inflation- indexed Federal 
bond yields.
A number of different approaches for model -
ling yield curves are put forward in the litera -
ture.4 Statistical financial models can also be 
used in cases where the estimation precision 
and the forecasting performance need to be as 
good as possible.5 If, however, it is the funda -
mental, economic determinants of interest rate 
developments that are of interest, empirical 
models, which lie at the crossroads between 
the macroeconomic and finance literature, pro -
vide more suitable information about the rela -
tionship between term structure dynamics and 
macroeconomic developments. In addition to 
statistical factors, these models consequently 
also draw on macroeconomic variables in order 
to estimate the term structure.6 Applied ver -
sions of this class are also presented in the 
models discussed in section 3.From a central bank’s perspective, the yield 
curve is an important benchmark as the interest 
rates across the entire maturity spectrum are 
key determinants for future economic and price 
developments. Its level plays a crucial role in 
intertemporal decisions made by the various 
agents – in the corporate sector for instance – 
about whether an investment project is profit -
able or not. In this context, the monetary policy 
short- term interest rate has traditionally been 
the lever used by central banks to exert an in -
fluence on macroeconomic activity and price 
developments. Yet, impulses from the short-  
term end are not transmitted one to one to the 
long- term end of the yield curve. Long- term Calculating risk

interest rates declined in the years prior to the 
financial crisis, for example, despite the fact 
that the Federal Reserve, for instance, gradually 
raised its (short- term) interest rates. This seem -
ingly contradictory response by long- term 
interest rates, which can be explained by risk 
premiums moving in opposite directions, clearly 
shows that monetary policy measures do not 
perfectly determine long- term interest rates.7
With interest rates nearing the zero lower 
bound in the short- term segment, a number of 
central banks have in recent years tried to apply 
non- standard monetary policy measures in the 
form of quantitative easing to directly influence 
long- term interest rates by making substantial 
purchases of long- dated government bonds in 
the secondary market. Under no- arbitrage con -
ditions, such a policy can serve to drive down 
interest rates if it can convince market partici -
pants more effectively than purely verbal com -
munication that the central bank is prepared to 
keep short- term interest rates low for an ex -
tended period of time. An alternative transmis -
sion channel would exist if the bond market 
were divided into different maturity segments 
and bonds and central bank liquidity did not 
constitute perfect substitutes for investors. 
Yields would then result from the respective 
maturity- specific bond supply and demand. Ul -
timately, however, one must assume that the 
link between interest rates for different matur -
ities in the deep and liquid markets for bench -
mark bonds cannot be permanently disrupted 
in this manner. Nevertheless, the relationship 
between bond yields and bond maturities has 
attracted increasing attention as a result of the 
non- standard monetary policy measures.
The slope of the yield curve 
as a leading indicator
Market participants’ forward- looking expect -
ations regarding growth and notably inflation 
contained in the nominal yield curves are a 
matter of particular interest for monetary 
policy makers. A large number of econometric studies filter this information out of the data. 
For example, they find a positive empirical rela -
tionship between the slope of the yield curve 
and future growth and output variables.8 
Moreover, negative yield spreads between long 
and short- term interest rates, ie an inverse yield 
curve, appear to precede a recession.9 At the 
Bundesbank, this is done using a model based 
on financial market variables for determining 
the likelihood of a recession in Germany.10 It is 
shown that the difference between ten- year 
and three- month interest rates can be used to 
capture relatively accurately the periods of 
weak cyclical growth since 1977 with a lead 
time of five months.Quantitative 
easing aims to flatten the yield curve at the long end

8 An early study was conducted by A Estrella and G Har -
douvelis (1991), The term structure as a predictor of real 
economic activity, Journal of Finance, p 555ff.
9 Here, the inverse term structure is the explanatory vari -
able used in a probit model, which can be used to estimate 
the probability of a recession. See, for instance, A Estrella 
and F S Mishkin (1998), Predicting U. S. recessions: Finan -
cial variables as leading indicators, Review of Economics 
and Statistics, p 45ff; A Estrella (2005), Why does the yield 
curve predict output and inflation? The Economic Journal, 
p 722 ff, as well as A Estrella, A O Rodrigues and S Schich 
(2003), How stable is the predictive power of the yield 
curve? Evidence from Germany and the United States, Re -
view of Economics and Statistics, p 629 ff.
10 The results of a comparable model published by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York can be found at www.
newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci12-5.pdf. The 
probit estimation equation of the German model applies 
the formula: Reces siont+5 = F(α+β( 10J–3M)t ), with F de -
noting the cumulative normal distribution function and the 
parameters α and β denoting the values -0.50 and -0.49 
respectively. The estimation was carried out using month-  
end data from the term structure estimates of the Bundes -
bank and the BIS. In only one instance, in the estimation 
using the spread between long- term and short- term inter -
est rates, did no downturn ensue after the 50% threshold 
value had been exceeded (type 1 error). This was in the 
year of German reunification in 1990. The recession be -
tween the years 2001 to 2003 is shown with a probability 
of less than 50% in both estimates (type 2 error). In Ger -
many, there is no fixed definition of recession periods like 
there is in the USA, which is decided on by the NBER Busi -
ness Cycles Dating Committee. In line with the classifica -
tion of cycles used in the research on business cycles, 
downturns – ie periods with declining output and decreas -
ing capacity utilisation – were applied. In contrast to the 
technical definition of a recession usually cited in the press 
– a decline in seasonally adjusted GDP over two consecu -
tive quarters – the number of recessions is consequently 
reduced. The chosen classification has a greater focus on 
the turning points of an economic cycle and disregards any 
short- term fluctuations.Deutsche Bundesbank

A further possible application is to estimate the 
empirical explanatory power of the slope of the 
yield curve for future inflation rate changes.11 If 
there is a change in the spread between inter -
est rates for different maturities – ie the slope 
of the yield curve is altered – this also reflects a 
shift in expectations for the inflation and 
growth path over the maturity periods under 
review. From a monetary policy perspective, ex -
pectations of changes in future inflation rates 
are particularly relevant. The starting point here 
is that the nominal interest rate for a period 
can be broken down into the expected infla -
tion rate and the ex- ante  real interest rate for 
the same period (Fisher equation). If liquidity, 
inflation or other risk premiums remain con -
stant over time and if the real yield curve also 
exhibits a relatively stable yield to maturity rela -
tionship over time, changes in the slope of the 
yield curve can potentially deliver information 
about changing inflation expectations.12 Given 
the above assumptions, however, the outcome 
of using monthly German term structure data 
over a period from 1975 to 2013 is that the 
term structure for differences in maturities of 
below one year to three years has no more 
than minimal explanatory power for future in -
flation rate changes. It is, however, possible 
that the assumptions used to derive the estima -
tion equation are also too restrictive in the case 
of short maturities. In this maturity segment, in particular, it would appear that the time- varying 
term premiums and a high degree of variance 
in short- term real interest rates largely deter -
mine the fluctuations in the nominal term 
structure.13 By contrast, the mid- maturity seg -
ment of the term structure is rather informative 
in terms of future inflation differences and at 
least can be used to explain more than a third 
of their variance. Against the backdrop of a 
stability- oriented monetary policy, investors are 
likely to perceive (short- term) inflation shocks 
as nothing more than a temporary phenom -
enon. A comparison of the actually observed 
inflation differences and those estimated using

ards any short-term fluctuations.

horizon does indeed exhibit a relatively high 
degree of correlation. A break in the co-  
movement between the estimated and the ac -
tually observed inflation differences has, how -
ever, been observed over the past few years, 
which could be linked to the growing import -
ance of risk premiums as a determining factor 
for yield curves.
As an alternative to the Fisher equation, 
inflation- indexed bonds can be used as a 
means of extracting inflation expectations. An 
inflation- indexed bond is an instrument which, 
in addition to a coupon, also pays an amount, 
mostly annually, to offset the realised inflation 
rate in the period in question. The compensa -
tion included in the yield on a nominal bond 
for expected inflation rates and an additional 
inflation risk premium to cover the uncertainty 
about whether the expected inflation rate will 
materialise are thus dispensed with (see chart 
on page  39). The break- even inflation rates 
(BEIR) derived from the spread between the 
nominal and real yield curves indicate how 
market participants expect inflation rates to de -
velop, on average, until maturity. Since the an -
choring of long- term inflation expectations has 
a particular bearing on assessments of monet -
ary policy credibility and effectiveness, long-  
term forward inflation rates are used for obser -
vation purposes. These disregard the volatile short-  term break-  even inflation rates and de -
rive long- term inflation expectations from the 
slope of the BEIR curve. Calculating spreads for 
a second time additionally eliminates term pre -
miums, which remain constant over the matur -
ities. The five to ten- year forward inflation rate 
for the European harmonised index of con -
sumer prices (HICP) moved unevenly during the 
crisis years from 2008 to 2013 without giving 
any indication of a robust trend towards in -
creasing or decreasing inflation expectations. If 
we interpret the anchoring of inflation expect -
ations as being a long- term stable mean value, 
we can therefore speak of inflation expect -
ations remaining anchored. The other compon -
ents making up the definition of anchoring, 
namely uncertainty or dispersion and the low 
level of responsiveness to temporary changes 
in the macroeconomic environment will not be 
discussed here. Studies based on surveys of 
households and professional forecasters, and 
data on inflation options, which depict higher 
moments of the probability distribution of ex -
pected inflation rates, have, however, revealed 
that shifts have most certainly taken place here.14
Fluctuations in the long- term forward inflation 
rate (see chart on page 40) likewise need to be 
interpreted. Some movements can be explained 
by changes in the economic situation in the 
euro area which, in a downturn, could ease 
price pressure or, if the growth outlook bright -
ens, might lead to increased capacity utilisa -
tion, thus potentially driving prices higher. This 
was evident inter alia  in the economic slump at 
the end of 2008, the slowdown in economic 
activity in mid-2011 and the recovery in 2010. 
On the other hand, some movements can be 
attributed to (technical) market effects, which 
can only be removed from the data to a limited 
extent. Investors thus regard Federal bonds as a 
safe haven for their capital in times of crisis.

the market for nominal Federal bonds, in par -
ticular, is also very liquid. It has likewise been 
observed that the liquidity premium for shorter 
maturities is higher than that for longer matur -
ities during critical spells. This is chiefly the case 
for nominal bonds owing to the higher out -
standing volume of this paper, the existence of 
hedging derivatives and the livelier trading ac -
tivity at a variety of trading venues. In times of 
stress, such as those which have punctuated 
the landscape since the outbreak of the finan -
cial crisis, many investors tend to shift their in -
vestments, notably those in the short to me -
dium- term maturity segment, out of inflation-  
indexed bonds into nominal paper. This de -
pressed nominal yields, boosted real yields and 
caused the BEIR to decline, particularly so for 
short to medium- term maturities, thereby 
sending the forward inflation rate higher.
However, much like other premiums, reliably 
adjusting yields and curves for liquidity effects 
is a tall order since liquidity premiums likewise 
cannot be observed directly and must therefore 
be derived either by making model- based as -
sumptions on the basis of total returns – which 
are prone to specification and estimation un -
certainties – or by calculating spreads relative 
to other bonds. The spread between KfW 
agency bonds and Federal bonds indicates just 
how significant this liquidity premium is for in -
vestors. Since KfW bonds have been guaran -
teed by the Federal government against de -
fault, they have the same credit standing as 
Federal bonds but are traded on a much smaller 
scale.15 Accordingly, the spread between KfW 
and Federal bonds ought to reflect the pre -
mium which investors are prepared to pay for 
holding a particularly liquid security. This pre -
mium varies significantly not just over time but 
also from one maturity segment to the next 
(see chart on page 41). Yield spreads between 
KfW and Federal bonds widened considerably 
when the dotcom bubble on the equity mar -
kets burst in 2000, when the US investment 
bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 
September 2008, and when, in 2011, the scale 
and magnitude of the European sovereign debt crisis caused widespread unrest among invest -
ors on the capital markets.
There are different ways of curbing the impact 
of such liquidity-  related effects in the analysis. 
The US Treasury Department, for instance, 
moved to only estimating its real yield curves 
on the basis of more liquid “on the run” 
bonds.16 However, this would not be possible 
for the euro area owing to a lack of ongoing 
issuances. To minimise estimation errors result -
ing from differing credit standing and liquidity 
effects between German and French bonds Liquidity

15 In June 2013, the volume of KfW bonds in circulation 
amounted to €372 billion. At the same time, the Bundes -
bank included Federal bonds with an outstanding volume 
of €1,291 billion in its yield curve estimate for Federal 
bonds.
16 The changeover occurred as at 1 December 2008; “on

across different maturities, the Bundesbank 
switched its calculation of real and nominal 
yield curves to country- specific data, which 
were subsequently aggregated with GDP 
weights.17
Shifting to a BEIR calculated from derivatives (in 
the case of inflation swaps, the fixed leg of a 
swap agreement to exchange fixed annual pay -
ments for the payment of the annual compen -
sation for inflation) as a measure of market par -
ticipants’ inflation expectations, likewise, would 
not constitute a clearly superior alternative for 
calculating inflation expectations either. On the 
one hand, inflation swaps which are not fully 
secured always reflect inter alia  the time-  
varying default risk of the counterparties (pri -
marily banks). On the other hand, a study 
based on high frequency data has shown that 
it is sovereign bonds, (reputedly) the most se -
cure form of investment, which dominate price 
formation in the swap market, particularly so 
during times of crisis.18
Despite the aforementioned problems, break-  
even inflation rates and forward inflation rate 
curves estimated using financial market data 
generally represent an important point of de -
parture for monetary policymakers looking to 
quickly capture market participants’ inflation 
expectations. The insights these data provide should, however, be taken with a pinch of salt 
given that risk and liquidity premiums have fre -
quently given rise to sizeable distortions, not -
ably during the financial crisis, as mentioned 
earlier in this article. This should continue to act 
as an incentive to improve model estimates 
which, in turn, would facilitate more robust in -
terpretations of the data.

factors to provide a linear depiction of the im -
pact of different variables. The model specifica -
tion used here deploys three latent – that is, 
not directly observable – factors as well as one 
real activity factor and one “liquidity stress fac -
tor”. The term “liquidity stress” refers to a situ -
ation in which market participants have an 
extraordinarily strong preference for liquidity, ie 
they prefer liquid instruments that can be read -
ily traded. They are prepared to forgo yields in 
favour of liquid financial instruments. Both 
macroeconomic factors (ie the real activity fac -
tor and the liquidity factor) are obtained using 
a principal component analysis.20 This approach 
thus draws on the findings in the literature on 
macroeconomic factor models, which allow 
the common dynamics in extensive datasets to 
be conflated in a small number of factors. 
Owing to the reduced dimensions, the factors 
thus obtained mean that the information con -
tent of large datasets can be condensed in a 
small number of variables and harnessed for 
model estimation purposes.21
Since liquidity stress is directly included in the 
term structure estimation as an explanatory 
factor, it is possible to examine the effects of a 
liquidity shock, ie of an increased preference 
for liquidity, in an impulse- response analysis. A 
one standard deviation increase in liquidity 
stress triggers a decrease in Federal bond yields. 
While long- term yields such as those on ten-  
year bonds diminish only marginally, those on 
one- year bonds respond with an immediate 
and considerable decline. The deviation from 
the original yield lasts for almost two years.22
Similarly, the real activity factor is extracted 
using a principal component analysis and con -
flates the dynamics of multiple real activity indi -
cators. An unexpected positive impulse of real 
activity measured in this way increases interest 
rates across the entire term. Responses to 
shocks in real activity are more pronounced 
than those to liquidity shocks. Moreover, yields 
for shorter maturities are more strongly influ -
enced by unexpected macroeconomic develop -
ments than those on long- term bonds. The im -pact on interest rates, however, is only a short- 
lived phenomenon which disappears again 
after about two years. The model specification 
with three latent factors, one real activity factor 
and the liquidity stress factor does indeed de -
liver estimates that are equally accurate as 
those provided by the model conventionally 
used in the literature, in which the short- term 
interest rate depends on the output gap and 
inflation as in a Taylor- rule setting.
Affine term structure models are based on the 
no- arbitrage assumption, ie the yield curve 
offers no scope for risk- free profits. The actual 
risk associated with holding a bond over a 
given period of time is isolated here through 
estimates under two probability measures (see 
also page 44). The model allows yields to be 
calculated which reflect the average risk- neutral 
short-  term interest rate expectation across a 
set period of time. Under a different probability Investors see

21 The liquidity stress factor represents the second princi -
pal component in the yield spread between KfW bonds 
and Federal bonds and of other liquidity measures such as 
bid/ask spreads. It captures the maturity- specific liquidity 
effect and is directly included in the term structure model 
estimate as a state variable.

measure, however, it is also possible to calcu -
late those yields which additionally contain the 
risk premium for holding a bond. Thus, the risk 
premium can be calculated as the spread be -
tween yields estimated using the two alterna -
tive probability measures. The derived (term) 
risk premiums are higher for long terms than 
for short ones and also vary considerably over 
time. Correspondingly, premiums for all matur -
ities were low during the calm economic period 
around 2005 (see chart on page 44).23 Interest 
rate expectations were considered to be rela -
tively stable, which meant that investors de -
manded a smaller risk premium for providing 
capital over longer periods of time. A decom -
position of the yield on ten- year Federal bonds 
into the risk premium and interest rate expect -
ations also illustrates that these two yield com -
ponents were roughly equal between 2005 
and 2007,24 indicating that compensation for 
risk was relatively insignificant in terms of the 
total return.When estimating interest rates over extended 
periods of time, analysts should be aware that 
the structural relationships assumed in the esti -
mation approach are subject to change over 
time. For instance, compared with the calmer 
economic period between 2002 and 2007, the 
financial and sovereign debt crisis in recent 
years has altered the potential for macroeco -
nomic indicators to influence the term struc -
ture. Crisis- induced developments now have a 
greater bearing on the yield curve than conven -
tional determinants, such as real activity and 
inflation expectations. The reunification of Ger -
many and the establishment of the European 
monetary union were also events which caused 
significant breaks in continuity. Such breaks can 
be accounted for using a time-  variable esti -
mate.
Literature on the learning behaviour of eco -
nomic agents (learning) provides an intuitive 
approach to accounting for gradual structural 
changes in modelling.25 The various expect -
ations under the learning approach are derived 
from the assumption that market participants 
are only boundedly rational. Instead of placing 
equal emphasis on all the information available 
to them for assessing the economic situation, 
they tend to focus on the most recent develop -
ments. By contrast, information obtained from 
earlier observations of macroeconomic time 
series are given a lower weighting in their esti -
mates. The results of this model approach are

Gaussian affi   ne multifactor term structure models
Gaussian affi   ne multifactor term structure 
models are frequently used to examine the 
yield developments of securities with differ-ing maturities. They combine the arbitrage- free model (holding portfolios with identical 
cash outfl  ows but different bond positions 
allows no room for risk- free profi  ts) that is 
anchored in fi  nancial market theory with macroeconomic determinants of the yield curve. Besides the short- term interest rate which refl  ects the monetary policy stance, the variables contained in multifactor models include unobservable factors and 
developments in the real economy that can potentially affect the level or the steepness 
of the yield curve. Term structure models 
are described as being affi   ne if the (logarith-
mic) bond prices they contain depict a lin-
ear function (including a constant) of the determinants. Specifi  cation as a Gaussian model implies a joint multivariate normal distribution of bond yields and of the fac-tors with constant conditional variances.  Ultimately, specifying the dynamics of the determinants in this way ensures that the 
stochastic discount factor (SDF) is, in turn, 
an affi   ne function of the determinants. This 
SDF guarantees that yields on bonds with differing maturities are arbitrage- free by clearly defi  ning the relationship between current bond prices and expected future 
bond prices for all maturities.
1) Ptn = Et(Mt+1 Pt+1n–1),
at all points in time t and for all maturities n 
where Ptn denotes the price of a zero- 
coupon bond with guaranteed payment of 
a monetary unit at point in time ( t+n) and 
Et is the expected value at point in time t, 
conditional on the information available at 
that juncture. The positive random variable 
Mt is the SDF. The determinants Xt can take the form of observable macroeconomic 
variables or of statistical (latent) factors de-
rived from the yield curve. The determin-
ants follow a vector autoregressive process:2) 
Xt = μ + ΘXt–1 + Συt,
with υt serving as the Gaussian error term 
(υt~N(0, Id)), μ as the constant and Θ and 
Σ as parameter matrices whereby the num-
ber of factors (d) provides the dimension. 
The short- term interest rate yt1 is an affi   ne 
function of the determinants:
3) yt1 = δ0 + δ1’Xt.
The aforementioned SDF is defi  ned as:4) 
Mt+1 = exp( – yt1 – 21 λt’λt – λt’υt+1),
where λt = λ0 + λ1Xt, and λt is also denoted 
as the market price of risk. This, too, is an 
affi   ne function of the determinants. If risk- 
neutrality is assumed, investors assess the 
potential for good or bad investment out-
comes in equal measure, in which case λ0 = 
λ1 = 0, rendering the SDF Mt+1 in equation 
4) dependent only on the short- term inter-
est rate yt1. By contrast, the more realistic 
assumption of an aversion to risk on the 
part of market participants delivers a posi-
tive market price of risk λt.
At the same time, the prices of all bond ma-
turities are decided by the determinants via the discount factor. Equations 1), 2), 3) and 
4) imply the price of a zero- coupon bond 
with a maturity of n:

ard approach, that is, one in which the agents 
are assumed to act entirely rationally.26
Both approaches are implemented by ascer -
taining the dataset which was actually available 
to investors at each point in time during the observation period. The interest rate estimate is 
based on this information and the individual 
estimates for each point in time are then strung 
together in a series. This approach ultimately 
provides a quasi real-time estimate of macro -
economic dynamics and interest rates,27 and 
also allows a comparison to be made of the 
uncertainty expressed in the time-specific vari -
ances of the residuals regarding the develop -
ment of macroeconomic factors and the 
short-term interest rate as calculated under the 
standard approach and the learning approach. 
The general decline in uncertainty prior to 2007 
reflects the moderation of macroeconomic in -
dicators since the 1980s as described in the lit -Limiting the 
 information set: a quasi real-time approachwhere An and Bn act as functions of the 
model parameters, such as the variance of 
the determinants or of the risk parameters.1
Term structure models can provide informa-
tion on the size of (maturity) risk premiums 
demanded by risk- averse investors, pro-vided two different probability measures are assumed for the development of the 
state variables in equation 2). In addition to being estimated using the physical probabil-
ity measure (which generates the actually 
observable variation) as in equation 2), the 
process is also examined using the risk- 
neutral probability measure:
6) Xt = μ* + Θ*Xt–1 + Συt .
The risk premiums which an investor de-
mands for holding a long-term bond ultim-
ately arise from the difference between the 
levels implicit in the model and are calcu-lated using the coeffi   cients estimated on 
the basis of the risk-neutral probability 
measure and the physical probability meas-ure.

ments can be seen in the variance response, 
notably so at the outset of the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis in 2008. While the vari -
ances calculated using the standard approach 
hardly respond to the upheaval, the learning 
approach quickly exhibits a discernible increase.
Conclusion
The models presented in this article are a means 
of gaining greater insight into the relation of 
short and long-term interest rates. They can be 
used to isolate risk premiums and expectation 
components and thus allow market partici -
pants’ expectations to be viewed separately 
from technical factors such as liquidity. They 
therefore offer a clearer picture of the factors 
behind the transmission of short-term interest 
rates, which are driven by monetary policy, 
through to long-term yields, which tend to be 
determined more by real activity.
The critical developments which have punctu -
ated the landscape in recent years have caused 
investors to shift the composition of their port -
folios and rethink their risk perception, besides 
sparking numerous regulatory initiatives, bring -
ing about significant structural changes in the 
financial markets. Taking heed of these devel -
opments and steadily refining or adapting the 
analytical toolkit used for assessing the term 
structure are important steps towards placing statements on the implications of term struc -
ture dynamics and on the efficiency and cred -
ibility of monetary policy on a more stable foot -
ing.Term structure

Differences in money and  
credit growth in the euro area and  
in individual euro- area countries
Euro- area monetary developments are currently characterised by moderate money growth paired 
with contracting volumes of lending to the domestic private sector. However, the aggregate fig -
ures conceal widely differing national dynamics. Positive money growth is being driven by port -
folio shifts in the core countries of the euro area, notably in Germany, whereas weak lending 
activity primarily reflects the ongoing decline in loans to the private sector in the euro- area per -
ipheral countries. These heterogeneous developments pose a challenge to euro- area monetary 
analysis. The assessment of monetary dynamics solely on the basis of the aggregate develop -
ments in the euro area is insufficient. Instead, it is important to clarify first the causes of the 
opposing movements in monetary and credit growth at the national level.
For Germany, which currently makes by far the largest positive contribution to money growth in 
the euro area, these analyses indicate a transitory increase in money demand. This gives rise to 
the question as to how this increase in money holdings will be reversed. By contrast, analysis of 
the peripheral countries shows that the decline in lending is attributable to cyclical developments 
as well as, above all, to the necessary correction of the credit overhangs that have built up in the 
past. Downside risks might arise in the event of further negative shocks as a result of negative 
feedback loops between credit supply and real economic developments.
The single monetary policy can respond to country- specific risks only if they affect the entire euro 
area. If that is not the case, steps have to be taken in other policy areas. For example, if signs of 
asset price inflation appeared in Germany, though without threatening price stability throughout 
the euro area, it would be necessary to use macroprudential instruments at the national level. For 
their part, the downside risks that exist in the peripheral countries have their origins primarily in 
the vulnerability of their banking systems to further negative shocks. Reducing this vulnerability 
calls for a number of measures such as the disclosure of sustained or expected losses, with cor -
responding balance-  sheet write- downs, a decision with regard to restructuring, resolving or 
recapitalising the banks affected, and regulation that aims to prevent new vulnerabilities from 
arising in the future.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
The annual growth rate of euro- area M3 de -
clined sharply when the financial crisis set in, 
reaching an all- time low of -0.4% in April 2010. 
It has recovered gradually since then. Whereas 
the acceleration of monetary growth in the 
euro area was initially – as is usually the case – 
driven by the expansion in lending to the do -
mestic private sector, money and credit growth 
became increasingly decoupled due to the es -
calation of the sovereign debt crisis from the 
third quarter of 2011 onwards (see the chart 
below). The sovereign debt crisis affected the 
dynamics of both lending and monetary aggre -
gates. For example, the real economic adjust -
ments in the countries especially hard hit by the 
crisis and the uncertainty engendered by the 
crisis depressed investment and, consequently, 
lending to the private sector. At the same time, 
crisis- induced uncertainty boosted investors’ 
preference for the highly liquid bank deposits 
included in M3. Moreover, the very long-  term 
refinancing operations in the context of the Eu -
rosystem’s unconventional monetary policy 
supported money growth in the form of an ex -
pansion in lending by banks to the govern -
ment. However, as market participants per -
ceived an easing of the debt crisis in the second 
half of 2012, euro- area money growth slowed 
down to just under 3% in May 2013.Thus, overall money growth remains subdued. 
Combined with weak lending activity, this does 
not at present signal inflationary risks for the 
euro area as a whole. However, closer analysis 
reveals that the current euro- area aggregates 
conceal widely diverging national dynamics. A 
breakdown of the monetary aggregate M3 and 
its counterparts into the respective member 
countries’ contributions, for example, sheds 
light on the high degree of heterogeneity. The 
chart on page 49 shows these “national contri -
butions” to euro- area money growth; the 
lower part of the chart shows, as an example, 
the same breakdown for lending to the domes -
tic private sector. For the sake of clarity, the 
smaller countries are bundled together to form 
three groups – smaller core countries, smaller 
peripheral countries and new member coun -
tries.
As the chart shows, the individual member 
states have made widely different contributions 
to the euro- area aggregates since the sover -
eign debt crisis began. More recently, by far the 
largest contribution to M3 growth came from 
Germany. France and the group of smaller core 
countries have likewise made significant contri -
butions to growth of euro- area M3. By con -
trast, monetary developments in the euro- area 
peripheral countries dampened money growth 
almost throughout the period under review 
– with the exception of Italy, whose contribu -
tions were increasingly positive from the begin -
ning of 2012 onwards.
The dynamics in loans to the private sector 
have likewise been shaped by positive contri -
butions from the core countries (notably from 
France and the group of smaller core countries) 
and negative contributions from the euro- area 
peripheral countries (with the exception of 
Italy). However, in contrast to the develop -
ments in monetary aggregates, the overall dy -
namics were driven by movements in the per -
ipheral countries. In particular, this applies to 
Spain, where the negative contribution to loan 
growth rose so sharply in the course of 2012 Moderate euro-

that it became the predominant factor in loan 
dynamics for the entire euro area.
The differences highlighted in national devel -
opments are ultimately due to the fact that 
monetary financial institutions (MFIs) – which 
include commercial banks and money market 
funds as well as the central banks – and non-  
banks in the individual euro-  area countries 
have been affected very differently by the fi -
nancial and debt crisis. The present degree of 
heterogeneity poses particular challenges for 
the monetary analysis of the Eurosystem, the 
main task of which is to assess the risks to price 
stability implied by monetary developments. Since the reasons for the country- specific de -
velopments cannot be adequately captured on 
the basis of the aggregated data, to analyse 
only the aggregate monetary variables is insuf -
ficient in the current situation. For this reason,

Monetary and credit  
growth in selected  
euro- area  countries
Monetary growth in Germany
Monetary growth in the euro area has mainly 
been driven by Germany in the last few years. 
Up until the fourth quarter of 2012, the annual 
growth rates of the German contribution to 
M3 rose to 8.7%, and to as high as 14.7% in 
the case of M1; by comparison, they remained 
in the lower single digits for the euro area. The 
annual growth rate of the German contribution 
to M3 subsequently contracted again (see the 
chart on page 51).
The steep growth in the German contribution 
to M3 was fuelled by the rising demand on the 
part of domestic non-  banks for investment 
forms included in M3. By contrast, deposits 
placed with German credit institutions by non- 
banks from other euro- area countries,1 which 
are also included in the German contribution, 
were only minor in volume.2 The main factors 
responsible for the high level of money de -
mand from German investors were the historic -
ally low interest rate level, the flat yield curve 
and the heightened political and economic un -
certainty against the backdrop of the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis.3 These factors caused 
domestic non- banks to make large- scale shifts 
in their portfolios in favour of highly liquid in -
vestment forms that were considered to be 
safer (cash, short- term savings deposits and, 
above all, sight deposits with German banks). 
Moreover, they received net inflows of funds 
from transactions with banks and non- residents 
–  for example, in the form of wages and 
profits –, which they invested primarily in short- 
term bank deposits.
Given the particularly narrow interest rate 
spread in Germany – compared with the rest of 
the euro area – between sight deposits on the 
one hand and short- term time deposits and 
savings deposits on the other, it was mainly 
sight deposits that benefited from investors’ in -creased preference for liquidity. The sharp 
build- up of sight deposits was fuelled primarily 
by domestic households and by non- financial 
enterprises, for which the development in de -
posits typically shows a high level of persist -
ency. With risk aversion still high and given the 
ongoing low level of opportunity costs com -
pared with longer- term deposits, these invest -
ors have so far continued to hold the increased 
share of short- term deposits in their portfolios, 
even though this currently means accepting a 
negative real return on a substantial part of 
their net assets.
In contrast to the dynamic monetary growth in 
Germany, the German contribution to the in -
crease in lending to the private sector (adjusted 
for loan sales and securitisation) has done no 
more than move sideways at a low level during 
the last two years.4 The modest growth in 
loans in Germany was mainly attributable to 
weak lending to non-  financial enterprises, the 
12-month growth rate of which had recovered 
in early 2011, having contracted sharply follow -
ing the Lehman Brothers insolvency. However, 
the rate remained moderate at just below 1½% 
on average, and fell again from the end of 
2012 to amount to 0.2% at the current end.

1 The German contribution also includes deposits with the 
Bundesbank, which have increased appreciably since mid-
2012 due to inpayments of ESM and EFSF capital.
2 The fact that banking statistics provide no indication of 
cross- border shifts of deposits in the corporate sector may 
be attributed, inter alia, to the statistical difficulties that 
arise in connection with the intragroup liquidity manage -
ment of cross- border groups. Reasons for this are, for ex -
ample, the inclusion of special financing subsidiaries which 
are not classified as belonging to the banking sector, and 
the fact that subsidiaries domiciled in Germany of enter -
prises from other euro-  area countries are, for statistical 
purposes, classified as part of the domestic corporate sec -
tor. Thus, inflows of deposits to their accounts do not lead 
to an increase in deposits held by foreign enterprises.

suggest that this decline was mainly the result 
of demand- side causes.5
In particular, weak investment activity by Ger -
man enterprises has dampened credit demand. 
The difficult economic situation in parts of the 
euro area and widespread uncertainty caused 
enterprises to make substantial cuts to their in -
vestment budgets during the course of 2012. 
Although the German economic outlook has 
become brighter again in the meantime, the 
propensity to invest is still depressed by uncer -
tainty regarding economic policy and the 
gloomier outlook for European sales markets. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that, in the past, the change in loans to non- financial en -
terprises has typically lagged behind both gross 
domestic product and investment by around 
three quarters.6 Thus, the downward trend in 
lending to non- financial enterprises could con -
tinue into next year even though the macro -
economic setting is expected to improve.… owing to

Factors determining changes in the volume of housing loans 
to households in Germany
In recent years, much interest has been focused 
on lending to non- fi  nancial enterprises, in par-
ticular on account of the collapse in such lend-
ing in 2009 and the resulting discussion about a 
potential credit crunch1 – notwithstanding the 
fact that lending of this kind only accounts for 
around one- third of all loans by domestic MFIs 
to the private sector. By contrast, lending to 
households has received less attention in the 
past, despite constituting almost twice the share of the total. However, given the historically low 
interest rates, heightened uncertainty and the 
large build- up in property prices of recent years, 
the focus has of late been shifting toward resi-dential real estate loans, which make up the li-
on’s share of lending to households.
The factors determining housing loan trends can 
be identifi  ed using an econometric model. The 
estimate specifi  cation is based on the model 
drawn up by Fonteny and Greiber (2006), which 
explains the real demand for loans for house purchase in terms of investment in residential 
construction (in relation to GDP), a long- term 
interest rate and the lagged endogenous vari-able,
2 while the set of explanatory variables is 
extended to include the three- month interest 
rate and (real) property prices for which more 
reliable data are now available. The equation is 
defi  ned in log differences of real variables (real 
growth rates) and estimated by ordinary least 
squares (OLS). To this end, the growth rate in 
loans for house purchase ΔWBK3 is regressed 
on its own lagged values, the investment ratio 
InvQ (ie the ratio of private- sector investment in 
residential property to GDP), the interest charged 
on loans for house purchase i_wbk, the change 
in property prices ΔP_immo and the three- 
month interest rate i_3m, as well as a constant α :
ΔWBK = α + β(L)ΔWBK(-1) + γ(L)InvQ + δ(L)
i_wbk + ρ(L)ΔP_immo + θ(L)i_3m + ε
The estimation period extends from the second 
quarter of 1999 to the fi  rst quarter of 2013.4, 5 
The contemporaneous values for the investment 
ratio and for (real) property prices (as proxies for 
the demand for debt fi  nancing) both prove to be 
important and statistically signifi  cant factors. 
Both variables display the expected plus sign. 
With an adjusted R² of 64%, the explanatory 
power of the model is satisfactory. Nonetheless, the estimation results are inherently subject to 
uncertainty.
The adjacent chart compares the actual real 
growth rate with its modelled path. Investment 
in residential property, property prices and inter-
est rates, as used in the model, still seem to pro-
vide a good explanation of actual developments. 
Robustness checks back up this fi  nding.6 Con-
trary to the assumption that, in addition to the 
usual determining factors, greater uncertainty at 
the current end is fostering investment in resi-
dential construction and thus also boosting the 
demand for housing loans, the model often 
slightly overstates actual lending in recent years.
There could be several reasons for this. For in-
stance, other creditors, in particular insurers, 
might have made greater inroads into the mar-
ket for loans to households for house purchase. 
Nevertheless, data from fl  ow of funds accounts 
show that, from a macroeconomic perspective, 
the role of insurers in real estate fi  nancing for households is still of minor importance. These 
companies’ share of the outstanding amount of all housing loans taken out by households has in

Reports, July 2006, September 2009, October 2010

2 See: E Fonteny and C Greiber (2006), The determin-
ants of recent developments in bank loans in France and Germany, Occasional Paper no 3, Banque de 
France.3 Nominal loans for house purchase are converted into a real variable using the GDP defl  ator.4 Data are available from the fi  rst quarter of 1991 on-ward. However, owing to various reclassifi  cations and 
German reunifi  cation, these have in some cases been 
synthetically back- calculated, so the existing estimate 
is based on the shorter sample. The estimation results do not change substantially if the longer period is used 
and a dummy variable is included in the estimation 
equation for the fi  rst quarter of 1999.5 Upfront testing has shown that it is suffi   cient to take 
into account two lags in order to guarantee the iid property of the residuals. According to F tests, real 
GDP can be excluded from the set of explanatory vari-ables. Exclusion of further variables is not possible.6 As the fi  gures for investment in residential property are only available in combined form for enterprises and households, in an alternative estimate real estate loans 
made to enterprises were added to such loans to households. Furthermore, estimates were performed 
using different price indices for the purpose of defl  a-
tion. In terms of quality, the results remained constant.Deutsche Bundesbank

Besides macroeconomic factors, the increasing 
significance of internal financing and shifts in 
the structure of external financing have shaped 
the financing dynamics of non- financial enter -
prises in the last two years. Although the total 
financing volume of non- financial enterprises 
declined during the course of 2012 compared 
with 2011, the share accounted for by internal 
financing rose considerably by more than ten 
percentage points to 82% in 2012. At the same 
time, enterprises made increasing use of do -
mestic debt securities, non- bank loans from 
abroad and trade credit in their external fi -
nances.7 Thus, the trend towards a growing 
substitution of domestic bank loans by other 
forms of financing continued in recent quar -
ters.
Whereas the growth in loans to non-  financial 
enterprises weakened significantly from the 
fourth quarter of 2012 onwards, the growth 
rate of lending to households in Germany re -
mained relatively constant at just over 1%. Household borrowing was focussed mainly on 
loans for housing. In addition to the favourable 
financing conditions, demand for housing 
loans in the current setting is being driven in 
part by uncertainty- induced portfolio shifts into 
tangible assets. However, for Germany as a 
whole growth in housing loans was still moder -
ate in May of this year, at an annual growth 
rate of 2.2%. The same is true, furthermore, of 
the annual growth rate for commercial prop -
erty loans, which stood at 1.5% at the end of 
the first quarter of 2013. Unlike housing loans, 
consumer credit, which is less significant in vol -
ume, fell considerably over the entire period … and increas-
ing use of alter-native financing instruments
Growth in lend-
ing to house-holds remains moderatefact fallen over the last ten years and stood at 
just under 7% at the end of 2012.
Over and above this, it is conceivable that in re-
cent years households have expanded their 
share of equity fi  nancing with respect to real es-
tate purchases. At the aggregate level, it has in-deed been possible to discern such shifts over 
the past few years, albeit to a moderate extent. 
Since 2010, there has been a slow but steady rise in the proportion of net investment by 
households, around 80% of which is directed to 
construction investment.7 This would indicate 
that households have recently restructured their 
asset portfolios to favour real estate.8 Informa-
tion supplied by the Association of German 
Pfandbrief Banks (Verband deutscher Pfandbrief-
banken) also points to a slight increase in the 
share of own funds in total fi  nancing.9
7 It is only possible to differentiate between invest-
ments in different capital goods in the case of gross 
capital formation. Mostly 80%, and in some instances 
as much as 90%, is accounted for by investment in 
buildings.
8 Since net investments recorded in the national ac-
counts – for conceptual reasons – consist exclusively of 
investments in new fi  xed assets, and hence transac-
tions involving used fi  xed assets (and thus also real es-
tate) are excluded, the trend is probably understated; 
the actual extent of the restructuring is likely to be 
higher.

under review. Other lending, too, continued to 
experience a decline.
Pronounced monetary growth coinciding with 
a moderate increase in loans to the private sec -
tor means that, based on the balance sheet 
structure underlying the monetary analysis, 
other counterparts of M3 – such as purchases 
of securities by the MFI sector, inflows of funds 
from abroad and a reduction in monetary cap -
ital – made a major contribution to the creation 
of money in Germany (see the box on pages 55 
and 56).
As shown in the counterparts chart on page 51, 
the German contribution to the increase of M3 
in the last two years was fuelled by a reduction 
in monetary capital and, in particular, by a con -
traction in the net external position of the Ger -
man MFI sector vis- à- vis the rest of the world 
as well as a rise in net claims of German MFIs 
on MFIs in other euro- area countries.8 The last 
two items reflect the inflows of funds in the 
non- bank sector arising from capital transac -
tions with non- residents. When balancing the 
growth contributions of both items, it is evi -
dent that net capital inflows from abroad in 
2011 had an increasingly positive effect on M3 
growth in Germany. The influence of these in -
flows then gradually diminished and is currently 
at a relatively low level, which contributed to 
the recent slowdown in (still strong) monetary 
growth in Germany.
According to the capital account, a consider -
able demand from non-  residents for German 
securities was observed until mid-2012 owing 
to the high level of uncertainty on the inter -
national financial markets and Germany being 
perceived as a safe haven. In contrast, German 
investors reacted with caution to the intensifi -
cation of the sovereign debt crisis in 2011; on 
balance, German investors’ demand for foreign 
securities recorded a strong decline. However, 
the calming of the markets as a result of a new 
bond purchase programme (OMT) being an -
nounced in addition to the decision to launch a 
single bank supervisory mechanism and recap -italise ailing banks led to capital moving back 
abroad in the second half of 2012: prompted 
by a declining risk aversion and against the 
backdrop of considerably reduced yields in Ger -
many, German investors started acquiring for -
eign paper more frequently again; in addition, 
the high demand from foreign investors for 
German securities markedly lost momentum in 
the course of the year.
The growth of the German contribution to M3 
was also supported by the greater reduction in 
longer- term claims vis- à- vis the banking sector 
(monetary capital) in favour of assets included 
in M3; since the end of 2012, the underlying 
portfolio shifts have made up the largest share 
of the contribution to German monetary 
growth. The declining demand of the non-  
banking sector for the longer- term bank de -
posits included in monetary capital can be ex -
plained by current low interest rates and, in 
particular, the narrow spread between longer-  
term bank deposits and sight deposits. More -
over, the reduction in Germany’s monetary 
capital also reflects the continuous sharp de -
cline in long- term bank debt securities held by 
non- banks in other euro-  area countries, but 
also by German households. The fact that even 
the German banking sector, which is regarded 
as relatively stable, sold fewer new bank debt 
securities shows that investors’ prudence was 
not the only factor that came into play here. 
The expectation of a continued expansionary 
monetary policy stance and a permanently high 
supply of central bank liquidity as well as Ger -
man banks’ ample base of deposits lower the 
pressure for these banks to offer more attract -
ive conditions on longer- term deposits and 
bank debt securities.Development

 The consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector and 
its signifi  cance for monetary analysis
Under the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
strategy, medium to long- term risks to price 
stability are assessed on the basis of monet-
ary indicators, notably the broad monetary 
aggregate M3 which has historically pro-duced sound forecasting information on 
price developments at longer forecast hori-
zons.1 However, the information that 
changes in M3 provide on long- term price 
developments can potentially be impaired 
by temporary factors. That is why monetary 
analysis does not confi  ne itself to merely analysing this monetary aggregate but in-
terprets monetary developments in the con-text of the euro- area consolidated MFI bal-ance sheet.
2
The consolidated balance sheet for the MFI sector is a direct extension of the defi  nition of the monetary aggregate M3. This defi  n-ition implies that M3 consists exclusively of 
those MFI liabilities to the money- holding 
sector that can be characterised as money. 
These include currency in circulation, over-
night deposits, other short- term deposits 
(deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years or deposits redeemable at notice of up to three months), plus money market 
fund shares and units, repurchase agree-
ments as well as bank debt securities issued with a maturity of up to two years. For the 
purpose of this defi  nition, the money- holding sector comprises households, fi  -
nancial and non- fi  nancial corporations and 
general government (with the exception of 
central government) which are resident in the euro area. Since liabilities within the 
MFI sector do not, by defi  nition, form part 
of the monetary aggregate, the balance sheets of the individual institutions within 
the MFI sector can be consolidated in order 
to produce a presentation of the money supply by means of a balance sheet. This 
consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sec-tor contains only assets and liabilities repre-senting MFIs’ claims and liabilities vis- à- vis the domestic non- bank sector or foreign banks or non- banks (see table on the fol-
lowing page).3
The most important item on the liabilities side of the consolidated balance sheet is 
the monetary aggregate M3 with its com-
ponents. Other liabilities of the MFI sector 
not included in M3 make up the other items shown on the liabilities side of the consoli-
dated balance sheet. Specifi  cally, these comprise deposits of central government and MFIs’ longer- term fi  nancial liabilities, which are known as “monetary capital” (deposits with an agreed maturity of over 
two years, deposits redeemable at notice of more than three months, bank debt secur-ities with an original maturity of more than 
two years and the capital and reserves of 
the MFI sector).
From a quantitative perspective, the most important assets reported in the consoli-dated balance sheet are credit to private 
non- banks (households, fi  nancial and non- 
fi  nancial corporations) and credit to general government in the euro area, in the form of 
1 See, for instance, G Carboni, B Hofmann and F Zam-
polli (2010), The role of money in the economy and in 
central bank policies, in L D Papademos and J Stark 
(eds), Enhancing monetary analysis, European Central 
Bank, pp 17-71. For a defi  nition of M3 and the consid-erations it is based on, see European Central Bank, The Monetary Policy of the ECB, 3rd ed, 2011, p 51ff.
2 The MFI sector chiefl  y comprises central banks, 
credit institutions and money market funds (MMFs) resident in the euro area. A detailed presentation of 
the consolidated balance sheet and the individual bal-
ance sheet items can be found in European Central Bank, Manual on MFI Balance Sheet Statistics, April 
2012.
3 Components of monetary aggregates and counter-
parts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for 
the euro area can be broken down into the individual 
member states’ national contributions, as used in the 
main body of the text. These consist of the claims and liabilities of the respective national MFI sector (includ-
ing the national central bank) vis- à- vis the money- 
holding sector throughout the euro area.Deutsche Bundesbank

loans or securities. While loans recorded 
here are typically loans granted by commer-
cial banks to governments and private non- 
banks, securities comprise securities origin-
ated by private and sovereign issuers that 
were purchased either by commercial banks 
or by central banks (under the Covered Bond Purchase Programmes (CBPP or CBPP2) or the Securities Markets Pro-
gramme (SMP), for instance).4 Another item 
shown on the assets side of the balance 
sheet is net external assets, ie the difference 
between assets and liabilities of euro- area 
MFIs vis- à- vis non- resident banks and non- 
banks. This item refl  ects non- banks’ capital 
infl  ows from external transactions.5 The 
item “Other counterparts of M3” contains 
inter alia MFIs’ non- fi  nancial assets as well 
as fi  nancial derivative positions.6
For monetary analysis, presenting the money supply in the form of a balance 
sheet offers two perspectives of monetary 
dynamics. The fi  rst takes a component- 
based view of the money supply to examine 
which factors are driving monetary devel-
opments and how the observed changes in 
components can be explained economic-
ally. The second is based on the notion that the monetary aggregate can also be calcu-
lated indirectly using the balance sheet identity, that is, as the sum of all asset- side items less central government deposits and 
monetary capital. Analysing monetary dy-
namics on the basis of these “counterparts” reveals which transactions between the MFI 
sector and the money- holding sector were 
behind movements in the money supply. 
For instance, an expansion in the monetary 
aggregate might be driven by factors such 
as a rise in lending to the private sector, se-curities purchases by MFIs (increase in credit 
in the form of securities) or portfolio shifts 
out of longer- term bank liabilities into M3 
(decline in monetary capital). These insights can then be harnessed to derive an assess-
ment, based on economic and statistical 
analyses, of whether current monetary dy-
namics entail risks for long- term price de-
velopments.

Unlike in the other large countries of the euro 
area (France, Italy and Spain), no significant im -
petus to M3 growth was generated from lend -
ing to government in Germany. Besides the ef -
fects of the orderly resolution of Hypo Real Es -
tate reflected in the annual growth rates until 
mid-2012, this was mainly due to the fact that 
the German credit institutions – compared with 
banks in other euro- area countries – made no 
large- scale purchases of government bonds on 
balance.
Developments in euro- area 
peripheral countries
In contrast to the core countries, where monet -
ary growth recovered in the course of 2010, 
euro- area peripheral countries’ national contri -
butions to the growth of M3 turned increas -
ingly negative from autumn 2009 (see chart 
above). The decline in money demand was 
caused, among other things, by intensifying doubts regarding the solvency of credit institu -
tions, the balance sheets of which were en -
cumbered with losses linked to the financial 
crisis and in some cases to close interconnec -
tions with government sectors affected by the 
debt crisis. Whereas outflows in Italy, Spain, 
Portugal and Greece were concentrated on 
sight deposits and short- term time deposits, 
the 2010 slump in monetary growth in Ireland 
was driven mainly by a drastic reduction in the 
demand for short- term bank debt securities in -
cluded in M3. Non- banks in Portugal, Spain 
and Italy, too, markedly reduced their exposure 
in this segment.
It was only in the wake of the additional provi -
sion of funds from the two three- year tenders 
that short- term bank debt securities became 
more attractive at the beginning of 2012. In 
particular Spain, but also Italy, recorded high 
growth in this context. With the debt crisis eas -
ing in mid-2012, the demand for short- term 
bank deposits recovered, too. In Italy, the re -Lending by

covery of monetary growth began as early as 
autumn 2011 as a result of substantial inflows 
to short- term time deposits and was therefore 
ahead of the other peripheral countries, which 
is likely to be attributable to banks in Italy offer -
ing relatively attractive interest rates in this 
market segment in contrast to those in other 
countries.
Since the outbreak of the financial crisis, the 
trend in monetary developments in all periph -
eral countries has been characterised, above 
all, by the continued reduction in loans to the 
private sector. The national contributions to the 
annual growth rate of loans to the private sec -
tor (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) 
have been negative in Ireland and Spain since 
summer 2009 (except for a brief interruption), 
since the beginning of 2011 in Greece and 
since summer 2011 in Portugal. The Italian con -
tribution has been close to zero since the end 
of 2011. From a sectoral perspective, the de -
cline is mainly attributable to net redemptions in lending to non- financial enterprises, al -
though lending to households, too, was re -
duced. The chart above shows that the annual 
lending rates to non- financial enterprises – par -
ticularly in Spain – are deep in negative terri -
tory.9 While the downward trend in growth 
rates continued until recently in Spain, but also 
in Italy and Ireland, it showed some signs of 
stabilisation in Portugal at the current end. 
With regard to lending to households, the 
12-month rates in all these countries remained 
negative, to which a key contributing factor 
has been housing loans.
The downward trend in these countries’ credit 
growth is due to a variety of factors. For ex -

result of weak economic activity in the periph -
eral countries. This is confirmed by surveys such 
as the Survey on the Access to Finance of Small 
and Medium- sized Enterprises (SAFE), in which 
enterprises state the lack of sales opportunities 
as the main reason for weak credit growth.10 
Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that 
the banks questioned in the Bank Lending Sur -
vey gave a reduction in enterprises’ investment 
spending as by far the most important reason 
for the decline in the demand for loans since 
mid-2011.
Moreover, the demand for loans in those coun -
tries where households and enterprises are al -
ready heavily indebted is also being dampened 
in particular by the need for deleveraging so as 
to reduce these debt levels. The development 
of the national contributions to the growth in 
loans to the private sector (see chart on 
page 57) shows that credit growth is currently 
particularly weak in countries in which lending 
grew especially sharply in the years before the 
onset of the crisis. The sustained credit boom 
caused the ratio of outstanding loans of the 
private sector to GDP in these countries to rise 
sharply in some cases (see box on pages  60 
and 61).11 The chart on page 61 shows that this 
held particularly true for Ireland, Spain and Por -
tugal. Starting from the record highs in loan 
volumes, considerable deleveraging has already 
taken place in these countries. However, by 
comparison with the other euro- area member 
states, there are still significant credit over -
hangs, the reduction of which could go on for 
many years in some cases if the current pace is 
maintained.
Besides the aforementioned factors, the de -
mand for bank loans in some of the countries 
under review here also decreased as a result of 
enterprises increasingly making use of other 
sources of financing. For instance, alternative 
creditors were important, such as other finan -
cial institutions and affiliated enterprises, for 
which the share in external financing of enter -
prises had already increased markedly since the 
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in autumn 2008.12  Market- based (debt) financing, too, 
went up. Whereas non- financial enterprises in 
Italy have recently increasingly obtained funds 
by issuing bonds, it has been equity issuance 
and the injection of other funds into equity 
that have made a positive contribution to ex -
ternal financing in Spain and Portugal.
Supply- side constraints – above all as a result of 
banks’ weak balance sheets, regulatory 
changes and higher lending risks – cannot be 
ruled out. Indicative of this is the Bank Lending 
Survey, according to which purely bank- related 
factors, such as the access to market financing, 
available liquidity and cost of equity through -
out the crisis period, were of key relevance for 
the tightening of credit standards – particularly 
in the second half of 2011. Since then, how -
ever, standards have been driven primarily by 
changes in the assessment of economic and 
firm- specific risks.
In addition to weak lending, cross- border pay -
ment flows have at times also had a dampen -
ing effect on monetary growth in the euro- area 
periphery. For instance, during phases in which 
the sovereign debt crisis had intensified, there 
were major outflows of funds from the coun -
tries particularly affected. Since the perceived 
easing of the debt crisis in mid-2012, however, 
capital has flowed back to the peripheral coun -
tries, contributing to something of a recovery 
of monetary growth in these countries.

10 The SAFE is carried out by the ECB. In this survey, 
around 7,500 enterprises are asked about their financing 
conditions on a biannual basis. The focus lies on small and 
medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), which are especially de -
pendent on bank loans. The latest survey results cover the 
period from October 2012 to March 2013, and the survey 
round was conducted from 18 February to 21 March 2013.
11 The advantage of this measure compared with more 
comprehensive concepts of leverage, as offered by flow- of- 
funds accounts, lies in the availability of long series for 
both components.

Change in outstanding loans relative to gross domestic 
product in selected euro- area countries
The current weakness in lending to the private 
sector was preceded by very pronounced 
credit growth in some euro- area member 
states in the years prior to the crisis. From a 
monetary policy perspective, this raises the 
question of the extent to which current nega-
tive credit growth in these countries refl  ects 
the need to reduce existing credit overhangs 
and is thus the consequence of a process of 
balance sheet adjustment on both borrower 
and creditor sides.
In order to gauge whether a credit overhang 
exists and how great any need for adjustment might be, a calculation is often made in terms 
of the change in loans to the private sector 
relative to a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) (see chart on page 61).
1 A common ap-
proach is to measure the extent of the adjust-
ment required by the deviation of (relative) 
outstanding loans from their long- term trend, extracting the latter using statistical fi  lter tech-
niques.2 However, the statistical fi  lter tech-
niques usually deployed have various weak 
spots in their design which severely limit the 
robustness of the estimated trend levels, par-
ticularly at the current end. In addition, fi  lter 
techniques attribute credit overhangs which 
have been building up over relatively long 
periods at least partly to the trend component, 
which means that credit overhangs tend to be 
underestimated in the periods when they are 
developing. This problem applies especially to 
those euro- area countries which have regis-tered a steady rise in their credit/GDP ratios 
since the beginning of monetary union.
An alternative to using fi  lter methods is to 
compare credit developments relative to GDP 
across structurally similar economies. For the 
euro area, the median of credit/GDP ratios across the individual member states may be 
used as a reference value.3 From a benchmark 
analysis of this kind, conclusions may be 
drawn about the indebtedness of the private 
sector in a given country relative to other 
countries. However, this analysis does not en-
able the absolute adjustment need to be 
gauged – in particular, because the change in the median for the euro area may be distorted upwards when excessive lending has been 
taking place in several countries at once.
As the chart on page 61 shows, the median for all euro- area countries climbed from 
around 90% at the beginning of 1999 
to 116% at the end of 2010, and was 111% in 
March 2013. In this period, loan book totals 
(relative to GDP) in Ireland, Spain and Portugal 
were well in excess of the median. In Ireland 
and Spain in particular, the build- up of debt 
between 2004 and 2009 proceeded at a sig-nifi  cantly faster pace than in the euro area as 
a whole. The growing indebtedness of the pri-
vate sector in Ireland, Portugal and Spain en-
compassed an increase in lending both to households and to non- fi  nancial enterprises. 
By contrast, loans to fi  nancial enterprises 
played no more than a minor role in the rise in 
the credit/GDP ratio in Portugal and Spain, 
whilst such loans were only of passing signifi  -
cance in Ireland.
The credit/GDP ratio for Germany has re-
mained more or less constant since 1999. As 
a consequence, the level of indebtedness in 
the private sector in Germany, which was ini-
tially above the euro- area median, dropped 
below it as time went by. Italy, which experi-
enced a signifi  cant rise in its credit/GDP ratio 
between 1999 and 2013 – here, too, driven by increasing lending to non- fi  nancial enter-
prises and households – represented the euro- area median in the fi  rst quarter of 2013.
There has already been a considerable drop in 
credit volumes (relative to GDP) from their 
previous highs in Portugal and Spain, and 
1 The advantage of this measure compared with more 
comprehensive concepts of leverage, as offered by 
fl  ow- of- funds accounts, lies in the availability of long 
series for both components.

was supported by a reduction in longer- term 
claims vis- à- vis the banking sector (monetary 
capital), which was fuelled, in particular, by ex -
tensive net redemptions in longer-  term bank 
debt securities. Moreover, the expansion of 
bank lending to government had a positive ef -
fect on monetary growth. Large-  volume pur -
chases of domestic government bonds were 
made by Spanish and Italian credit institutions 
around the same time as the three- year tenders 
in December 2011 and March 2012.13 In add -
ition, banks in Spain significantly stepped up 
their loans to domestic government in the 
second quarter of 2012. In Italy, the expansion 
of total lending to government was a key fac -
tor for the rise in the Italian contribution to 
monetary growth in the euro area, which 
began in mid-2011 and stands at 0.6 percent -
age point at the current end.Challenges for the single 
monetary policy
Medium to long- term inflation risks can – from 
a monetary analysis perspective – be the result 
of strong and persistent monetary growth and 
the associated build-  up of a monetary over -
hang. However, in the euro area as a whole, 
money growth is currently comparatively slow. 
Furthermore, weak loan growth is having a 
sustained dampening effect on the trend 
growth rate of money, which means that mon -
etary developments for the euro area as a 
whole are signalling no upside risks to price 
stability.
However, given the pronounced heterogeneity 
of monetary developments in the euro area, 
the risks to price stability are not distributed Monetary 
growth sup-ported by  securitised  lending to  governmentSubdued under-lying monetary 
growth in the 
euro area as a 
wholeeven more so in Ireland.4 It also needs to be 
borne in mind that credit/GDP ratios at the 
current end probably overstate the actual de-
gree of indebtedness in these countries, be-
cause GDP (the denominator in the ratio) is 
likely to have fallen below its long- term equi-
librium value, ie below the potential output 
level, owing to the weakness of the economy. 
If we correct for this effect, the credit/GDP 
ratio drops from 153% to 146% in Spain and from 152% to 145% in Portugal.
5 As one can 
assume that the median will tend to overesti-
mate equilibrium credit volumes (relative to GDP) because of the sharp rise in indebted-
ness across a host of countries, the result of 
this is relatively conservative estimates of the 
actual overhangs.
On the whole, the cross- sectional comparison 
suggests that some euro- area member states 
still have pronounced credit overhangs even if 
we correct for cyclical effects. It is to be ex-
pected that the reduction of these overhangs 
will have a dampening effect on lending in 
these countries and thus across the euro area 
as a whole for some time to come.4 In Ireland, in contrast to the other countries, value 
adjustments have played a signifi  cant role in the reduc-
tion of loan book totals.5 The EU Commission’s estimates for the output gaps 
in the relevant countries were used to make this cor-
rection. In the case of Ireland, the correction leaves the 
credit/GDP coeffi   cients practically unchanged, since the Commission does not anticipate any signifi  cant 
output gap.Ratio of loans to GDP*

evenly across all member states. Some crisis 
countries, for instance, are recording clearly 
negative money and credit growth rates, which 
– besides the state of the business cycle – re -
flect to a large extent the necessary correction 
of credit and monetary overhangs accumulated 
in the past. The persistently high vulnerability 
of the banking sectors in these countries means 
that the necessary adjustment process none -
theless entails risks. For instance, further nega -
tive shocks –  such as an unexpectedly high 
share of non- performing loans – could cause 
economies to further weaken if banks were to 
restrict their credit supply excessively. The asso -
ciated feedback effects on the stability of the 
banking sector and on credit supply could in -
tensify the ongoing deleveraging process and 
entail a further contraction in the volume of 
money and credit with downside risks to price 
stability.
By contrast, in Germany monetary growth has 
evolved at a considerably higher level com -
pared with the euro- area peripheral countries. 
The reasons for the increase in the German 
contribution to M3 (decline in monetary cap -
ital, increase in the net external position of the 
MFI sector) point to a temporary rise in the 
money growth rate.14 Money holdings, espe -
cially holdings of overnight deposits, are none -
theless large in Germany.15
So long as the additional money stock has no 
impact on aggregate demand, it does not exert 
any influence on inflation. The large money 
holdings, in particular in the form of overnight 
deposits, are currently favoured by low oppor -
tunity costs compared with longer- term de -
posits and the high level of uncertainty. How -
ever, this is countered by the negative expected 
real return on highly liquid deposits as a result 
of the low interest rate environment. The ques -
tion of how these money holdings, having ac -
cumulated as a result of these special factors, 
will unwind in the future is crucial to the as -
sessment of potential risks to price stability. To 
the extent to which the previous portfolio shifts 
were merely reversed, the reduction of a mon -etary overhang would not pose risks of infla -
tion. This would be the case, for instance, if 
shifts of deposits included in M3 into longer-  
term liabilities of the German banking sector 
(monetary capital), which are not included in 
M3, were to occur. However, as described 
above, the incentives for portfolio shifts to -
wards long- term liabilities of the domestic 
banking sector are relatively small in an envir -
onment in which low interest rates are ex -
pected to persist, especially in view of the fact 
that domestic banks, with their ample deposit 
base, have little incentive to offer attractive 
conditions on long- term deposits. Alternatively, 
a monetary “rebalancing” within the monetary 
union in the form of portfolio shifts of German 
investors to more attractively remunerated de -
posits or longer- term bank liabilities in the 
euro- area peripheral countries is also conceiv -
able. It is, however, questionable whether 
these assets will represent a viable alternative 
for German non- banks in the foreseeable fu -
ture, given that their high level of risk aversion 
can be expected to continue.
The developments prior to the financial crisis 
showed that the risks stemming from monetary 
developments do not necessarily lead to sharply 
increasing prices on product markets. The dy -
namic monetary and credit developments in 
the years before the onset of the financial cri -
sis, for example, caused a sharp increase in 
property prices in some countries. Such price 
cycles on asset markets engender risks to finan -
cial stability, which may also have repercussions 
for the economy as a whole and must there -
fore be kept in mind when conducting monet -
ary analysis. With regard to possible scenarios 
for Germany, investors could try to shift their 
portfolios in favour of more lucrative forms of 
investment by purchasing non- monetary assets Potential down-
side risks to price stability in some peripheral countries
Large money 
holdings

Risks to price 
stability lower for shifts to monetary  capitalRisks higher for shifts to other non- monetary assets
14 Although the continued current account surpluses do 
contribute to persistent money growth, this effect, taken in 
isolation, is not sufficiently important in quantitative terms 
to cause risks to price stability.
15 As described above, deposits of non- resident non- banks 
are not important in quantitative terms for the change in 
the German contribution to M3, which is why they are dis -
regarded in the following discussion.Deutsche Bundesbank

such as shares, other securities or property, 
which in turn could give rise to an increase in 
asset prices. It is likely that German investors 
would initially focus primarily on domestic 
assets. The already relatively high valuation of 
comparatively low- risk non- monetary assets (ie 
government bonds, which are perceived as 
relatively safe, corporate bonds and, in some 
regions, property) could, however, cause in -
vestors to increasingly turn to riskier invest -
ments.
Portfolio adjustments of this kind would, how -
ever, merely tend to produce a shift in the level 
of asset prices and not lead to a persistently 
higher growth rate. By contrast, asset price in -
flation – ie a longer- term acceleration of asset 
price growth  – is typically associated with 
strong credit expansion. Currently subdued 
credit growth provides no indication of such a 
debt- financed increase in asset prices in Ger -
many.
However, should asset price inflation, as a re -
sult of accelerated credit growth, become evi -
dent in Germany in the future without implying 
direct risks for the euro area as a whole, the 
Eurosystem’s single monetary policy would not 
be able to react. Instead, macroprudential in -
struments would have to be deployed at the 
national level.By contrast, the downside risks in the periph -
eral countries are mainly due to the fact that 
their banking systems are vulnerable to further 
negative shocks. To reduce this vulnerability will 
require, among other things, the disclosure of 
sustained or expected losses – including corres -
ponding write- downs on balance sheets –, de -
cisions on the resolution, restructuring or re -
capitalisation of troubled banks so as to create 
new loss- absorbing capacities, and regulation 
designed to prevent new vulnerabilities from 
arising in the future – including capital require -
ments for government bonds held by banks.
However, these issues cannot be resolved by 
means of (non- standard) monetary policy 
measures; instead, they fall under the remit of 
other areas of policy, in particular banking 
supervision and fiscal policy. Monetary policy 
can, at best, prolong the necessary adjustment 
processes over time, but invariably runs the risk 
of unduly lowering the adjustment pressure 
needed on the other parties involved. If, how -
ever, the measures required to enhance the 
 resilience of the banking systems in the euro-  
area peripheral countries are foregone, there 
remains the danger that the interdependencies 
described above between the financial system 
and the real economy could intensify in a nega -
tive way, thereby obstructing a recovery of the 
real economy.Risk of strong 
credit expansion currently rela-tively low
