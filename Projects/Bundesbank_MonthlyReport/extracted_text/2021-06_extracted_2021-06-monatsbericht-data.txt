Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic output is likely to rise steeply 
again in the second quarter of 2021 following 
the first- quarter setback,1 largely on the back 
of activity in the services sector. There has 
been a strong decline in the number of new 
COVID-  19 cases as a result of the decision to 
apply the “emergency brake” to contain the 
coronavirus pandemic at the end of April, the 
other containment measures and considerable 
progress in the vaccination campaign. As early 
as May, many of the previously imposed restric -
tions had either been eased to a significant ex -
tent or even lifted altogether, with services 
such as the hotel and restaurant sector and the 
wholesale and retail trade likely to have been 
the main beneficiaries. This caused business ex -
pectations in these sectors to improve strongly. 
On the other hand, other burdens only indir -
ectly related to the pandemic are shaping eco -
nomic activity. As in the first quarter, increased 
supply bottlenecks, mainly for intermediate 
goods such as semiconductors, are placing a 
dampener on production, particularly in the 
automotive industry. Similarly, there have been 
mounting reports, most recently from the con -
struction sector as well, about material short -
ages for intermediate products such as wood, 
steel and insulation materials. That said, the 
majority of industrial enterprises anticipate a 
further improvement in their business activity, 
according to the ifo Institute’s latest surveys. 
This suggests that the strains caused by the 
supply bottlenecks are limited.
Industry
Industrial output declined again somewhat in 
April 2021 following a brief recovery in March. 
After seasonal and calendar adjustment, it was 
down by ¾% on both the previous month and the first quarter. Bottlenecks in the supply of 
intermediate goods, which had already im -
paired production in the first quarter, also 
played an important role at the beginning of 
the second quarter. They will probably continue 
to dampen industrial output in the next few 
months.2 The automotive sector is still particu -
larly affected by shortages of semiconductors, 
with output falling again in April, by around 
6%, on what had already been a distinctly sub -
dued previous quarter. Seasonally and calendar-  
adjusted auto production numbers experienced 
another substantial decline in May, according to 
data from the German Association of the Auto -
motive Industry (VDA). Broken down by main 
groups, the production of intermediate goods 
remained unchanged in April compared with 
the first quarter of 2021. Output of consumer 
and capital goods, by contrast, was down sig -
nificantly, but at least registered a marked in -
crease if the automotive sector is excluded. All 
in all, industrial output still lagged 4% behind 
the pre- crisis level of the fourth quarter of 2019.
In April, industrial orders remained at the high 
level of March, which had undergone a signifi -
cant upward revision. In fact, seasonally adjusted 
orders remained on a clear upward path if vola -
tile large orders are excluded. Overall, orders in 
April were up again, by a substantial 3%, on the 
already strong figures for the previous quarter. 
Broken down by sector, demand for intermedi -
ate goods now only rose at a slow pace com -
pared with the previous quarter. Demand for 
capital goods and, in particular, consumer goods 
picked up significantly, meanwhile, with new 
orders in the automotive sector recording an 
above-  average rise. In a regional breakdown, 
German industrial enterprises benefited from German econ -
omy returns to

pered by material shortages rose to the highest level since 
the time series was first recorded for Germany as a whole.Deutsche Bundesbank

lively foreign demand, mainly from non- euro 
area countries, while domestic demand now 
only experienced marginal growth. In April, in -
dustrial orders surpassed the pre- crisis level by an 
impressive 12%, implying that demand is signifi -
cantly outstripping industrial output.
Like industrial output, nominal industrial sales 
were down significantly in April, posting a sea -
sonally adjusted decline of 1¾% on the previ -
ous month, in which they had seen a consider -
able increase. Compared with the previous 
quarter, however, sales were virtually un -
changed, and excluding other transport equip -
ment, which is prone to fluctuation, even rose 
by 1¼%. Broken down by sector, April saw 
strong growth for intermediate goods and sig -
nificant decreases for consumer goods and pri -
marily capital goods compared with the previ -
ous quarter. In regional terms, domestic sales 
remained virtually unchanged, while foreign 
sales saw steep growth in the euro area being 
offset by losses in non- euro area countries.
Nominal goods exports in April recorded only a 
slight seasonally adjusted rise on the month, 
but were nonetheless well up on the first quar -
ter of 2021 (+1½%). One striking feature was 
the strong decline in the value of exports to 
China. In real terms, however, total exports to 
both euro area and non- euro area countries re -
mained broadly unchanged compared with the 
first quarter, which means that they were still 
1½% down on the pre- crisis level. Goods im -
ports, meanwhile, registered declines on the 
strong previous month that were significant in 
nominal terms and worse still in real terms. 
Compared with the previous quarter, though, a 
strong rise in imports from non- euro area coun -
tries left goods imports a significant 1% higher 
in real terms. They exceeded their pre- crisis 
level to a similar extent.

pared with the exceptionally robust March, 
though it did exceed the average of the first 
quarter (+1¼%), with finishing trades up signifi -
cantly. The main construction sector posted a 
strong decrease, however. Building construc -
tion and civil engineering were affected to a 
similar degree. Bottlenecks in the supply of 
intermediate products and construction mater -
ials are also likely to have hampered output in 
the construction sector recently. According to 
the ifo Institute, 18% of firms in the main con -
struction sector reported that material short -
ages were impeding construction activity in 
April, rising to as many as 37½% in May, after 
coming in just short of 4% in the first quarter. 
These problems are mainly attributable to the 
brisk demand and the resulting rapid rise in the 
prices of lumber, steel, insulation and various 
synthetic materials, for example.3 The ifo Insti -
tute found that equipment utilisation had stag -
nated in the main construction sector in May, 
leaving it above its long- term average.
Labour market
With the pandemic fading and the vaccination 
campaign making progress, optimism is grad -
ually gaining the upper hand in the labour mar -
ket as well. Provisional figures from the Federal 
Employment Agency indicate that the still large 
number of persons in cyclically induced short-  
time work fell significantly to 2.61 million in 
March. This decline is in line with the easing of 
the containment measures. Nevertheless, the 
loss of working hours per short- time worker is 
still very high and barely down compared with 
February. This means the volume of labour lost 
through short- time work was still twice as high 
as it was shortly before the measures taken to 
combat the pandemic were tightened in Octo -
ber 2020. The number of short- time workers is 
likely to have gone down further since March. 
Based on its own surveys, the ifo Institute be -
lieves that there were still nearly 2.3 million 
people in short- time work in May.4 The number 
of registrations for short- time work dropped to a very moderate level over the past few months 
up to May.
Employment remained on its modest growth 
path in April despite restrictions being tight -
ened again to counter the rising incidence of 
infections at the time. Employment subject to 
social security contributions (according to data 
as of March) saw a positive development, while 
exclusively low- paid part- time employment and 
self- employment continued to decline. Indica -
tors of willingness to recruit new staff increas -
ingly show that labour market conditions are 
expected to improve in the near future. The 
number of vacancies rose again.
Registered unemployment was down slightly in 
May. The decline by a seasonally adjusted 
15,000 persons was too small to change the 
unemployment rate, however, which remained 
constant at 6.0%. While unemployment driven 
more by cyclical factors was already registering 
a further slight decline during the fourth quar -
ter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, more 
long-  term unemployed persons switched to 
the basic welfare allowance after more than a 
year of pandemic conditions. The IAB’s un -
employment barometer rose to an extremely 
optimistic level in May; unemployment is likely 
to fall swiftly in the next three months.
Prices
Crude oil prices resumed their upward trajec -
tory in May 2021 after experiencing a brief set -
back, mainly on the back of improving medium- 
term demand prospects and the continued rig -
orous implementation of production cuts by 
OPEC and its partners. Crude oil prices were 
approximately 5% up on April, leaving them 
roughly twice as high as they had been one 
year previously. They continued to edge up in 
June. As this report went to press, the price of 
a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$73. Sharp decline in

Crude oil futures  were trading at marked dis -
counts. The discount on crude oil futures was 
US$3¼ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$6 for deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices continued to rise steeply in April, 
with non- energy products once again becom -
ing significantly more expensive. By contrast, 
the hike in energy prices eased off. Industrial 
producer prices, for which data up to May are 
already available, paint a similar picture with a 
lower amplitude. Energy prices were up again 
here towards the end of the period under re -
view. Import prices and industrial producer 
prices recently outstripped their prior- year 
levels, exceeding them by just over 10% and 
roughly 7%, respectively.
Consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased 
by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May and thus 
at a similar rate as in April.5 Prices of industrial 
goods excluding energy in particular rose 
steeply, affecting clothing, whose prices nor -
mally fluctuate sharply, and other goods. This 
took clothing prices more or less back to levels 
last seen before the first wave of the corona -
virus pandemic began in March 2020. Prices of 
other non- energy industrial goods were already 
significantly above pre- pandemic levels again. 
Inflation was moderate for the other HICP com -
ponents, however. Annual headline HICP infla -
tion went up from 2.1% to 2.4%,6 while the 
core rate excluding energy and food rose from 
1.1% to 1.6%. The increase was partly attribut -
able to the relatively early Whitsun holiday, 
which meant that travel prices, in particular, 
were clearly higher than they had been one 
year earlier. However, even excluding this com -
ponent and clothing, inflation climbed from 
1.4% to 1.6%. Headline HICP inflation is likely 
to slow again temporarily in the current month, 
partly due to the countervailing effect of the 
Whitsun holiday. Starting in July, however, the 
base effect of the temporary cut in VAT rates in 
20207 means that inflation can be expected to 
return to significantly higher rates, even if a 
one- off statistical effect will still have a damp -ening impact in the first instance. This effect is 
due to the fairly strong pandemic- driven ad -
justment of some HICP weights to the con -
sumption habits of 2020. It caused the inflation 
rate to rise markedly in the first quarter of 2021 
and will dampen it significantly at times from 
July to October.8 As things stand today, rates of 
around 4% are possible in the short term if this 
waning effect abates towards the end of the 
year.9
Public finances10
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
posted a considerable deficit of almost €1½ bil -
lion in the core area in the first quarter of 
2021.11 Last year, the first quarter was barely 
affected  by the coronavirus crisis, and the re -
sult was broadly balanced. It was primarily 
pandemic- related special payments to long-  
term care facilities that led to the distinct de -
terioration in the financial situation.
Total revenue increased by 3½%. Although em -
ployees’ contributions saw a muted increase, 
they were bolstered by contributions made for 
short- time workers. In addition, revenue from Import and 
producer  prices 
continue to rise 
steeply

5 Since the measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic 
were relaxed, only around one- tenth of all prices had to be 
imputed. See also Federal Statistical Office (2021).
6 The annual rate of consumer inflation according to the 
national Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose from 2.0% to 
2.5%.

10 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
11 The developments outlined here and in the remainder 
of the text exclude the provident fund. This includes trans -
fers amounting to around 0.1 percentage point of the core 
area contribution rate. Assets accumulated in this way are 
to be depleted again in the 2030s to dampen the expected 
contribution rate rise.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

contributions for recipients of unemployment 
benefit rose sharply. Contributions payable on 
pensions saw stable growth, unaffected by the 
pandemic. Expenditure rose very steeply, by 
16½%. Even excluding the aforementioned 
special payments of €1½ billion to long- term 
care facilities,12 it still saw dynamic growth of 
4%. With benefit rates unchanged, cash bene -
fits experienced sustained strong growth, at 
11%. By contrast, spending on non- cash bene -
fits, a larger expenditure item, remained virtu -
ally unchanged on the year. Pandemic- related 
restrictions on the number of people admitted 
to residential care, not least, may have contrib -
uted to this.
For the year as a whole, too, the coronavirus 
crisis is likely to weigh on the finances of the 
long- term care insurance scheme. Compared 
with 2020 (surplus: €1½ billion), the result 
could deteriorate by around €4 billion. The rev -
enue side will be affected by the absence of 
last year’s central government payments of 
just under €2 billion to cushion special corona -
virus burdens. In addition, the contribution 
base is likely to increase only moderately as a 
result of labour market growth initially remain -
ing muted. On the expenditure side, the 
coronavirus- related special payments to long-  
term care facilities run until the middle of the 
year. For the year as a whole, therefore, they 
could stand at about the same level as the pre -
vious year, at around €3 billion. Furthermore, 
the underlying pace of expenditure growth is 
set to be rather high for the year in its entirety, 
too. This is chiefly attributable to the ongoing 
impact of benefit expansions from previous 
years. However, an initially planned further 
benefit increase will not take place this year 
and will be implemented, in part, next year.13 
This year’s expected deficit will erode the gen -
eral reserve. However, as the contribution rate 
was raised by a very significant 0.5 percentage 
point in 2019, the reserve is well- stocked (end- 
2020: €8½ billion or almost 20% of annual ex -
penditure). There is, therefore, no risk of the 
general reserve undershooting its lower limit of 
half of one month’s expenditure in 2021.Next year, it is likely that the economy will 
make a significant recovery and the long- term 
care insurance scheme will not make any more 
coronavirus- related special payments. The fi -Revenue bol -

12 The institutions receive financial compensation for lost 
income from long- term care services due to the COVID-  19 
crisis (for example, as a result of a facility closing or freez -
ing admission of new care recipients to curb the risk of in -
fection). In addition, the long- term care insurance scheme 
reimbursed non- residential and (partially) residential long-  
term care facilities for COVID-  19 testing costs.
13 At the end of last year, the Federal Government did in 
fact identify a need for adjustment for all benefit rates of 
5% for 2021. This was based on the cumulative consumer 
price inflation from 2017 to 2019. The benefit rates for 
non- cash care benefits and short- term care will now be 
raised next year. No further dynamic adjustment is yet 
planned for nursing benefits.Deutsche Bundesbank

nances of the long- term care insurance scheme 
will profit from this on the revenue and ex -
penditure sides. This will still be the case even if 
non- cash benefits are once again taken up on 
a larger scale once the restrictions expire. How -
ever, significant additional burdens would 
emerge from the planned reform of the long-  
term care insurance scheme. Under this reform, 
the scheme is to reimburse care recipients a 
growing share of costs as the amount of time 
spent in a care home increases.14 The associ -
ated additional expenditure by the long- term 
care insurance scheme will increase due to an -
other component of the reform efforts; as of 
September 2022, long- term care facilities will 
have to remunerate their staff in line with col -
lective wage agreements in order to have their 
long- term care costs co- funded by the long-  
term care insurance scheme. Finally, the benefit 
rates for non- cash care benefits and short- term 
care are set to be raised on 1 January 2022. 
The Federal Ministry of Health calculates the 
long- term care insurance scheme’s costs for 
these three measures at around €3 billion in 
2022. From 2022 onwards, central government 
will provide an annual grant of €1 billion to -
wards these costs. Furthermore, the supple -
mentary contribution rate for childless persons 
is set to rise by 0.1 percentage point to 0.35% 
(meaning that they will pay 3.4% overall). This 
is expected to generate additional receipts of 
just under €½ billion.
All in all, the long- term care insurance scheme 
is likely to book another significant deficit in 
2022, though it may be somewhat down on 
the current year. However, demographic 
change will put the scheme’s finances under 
substantial pressure in the medium to long 
term. This is because it will cause expenditure 
to rise dynamically and the revenue base to 
grow more slowly. Overall, therefore, consider -
ably increased contribution rates are on the 
cards. The planned benefit expansions would 
heighten demographic spending pressures. By 
contrast, the partially compensatory measures 
on the revenue side would lose importance in 
relative terms over time.Some see a higher central government grant as 
a way out of the public long- term care insur -
ance scheme’s looming financial problems. 
However, there is clearly no leeway for this in 
the Federal budget. Tax increases, or cuts in 
other areas, would therefore be necessary. 
Should the possibility of a larger financial con -
tribution from central government be con -
sidered, more transparency with regard to the 
specific longer- term needs and concrete fund -
ing would be crucial. Another idea under dis -
cussion is that of expanding the public long-  
term care insurance scheme from a partial to a 
relatively comprehensive full insurance model. 
This would significantly exacerbate the existing 
financial problems. It would compound the

which also weighs on the statutory health and

benefits, it should also be noted that means-  
tested assistance for long- term care is already 
available to care recipients if their own financial 
means do not suffice for this purpose. An ex -

preserve private wealth. In the discussion about 
expanding the long- term care insurance

14 Fixed residential care costs currently have four compon -
ents: a facility- specific uniform residents’ co- contribution, 
the facility’s staff training costs, costs of accommodation 
and meals, and the facility’s investment expenses. At the 
start of 2021, these outlays totalled an average of around 
€2,150 per month, according to data from the German as -
sociation of substitute health insurance schemes (Verband 
der Ersatzkassen) . Long- term care co- contributions and 
training costs currently make up around 42% of this figure 
(roughly €900). The former are now set to be reimbursed 
by up to 70%, as the duration of residential care increases. 
This will considerably ease the burden on care recipients 
who do not obtain assistance for long- term care (previ -

Securities markets
Bond market
At €146.9 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in April was down on the previ -
ous month’s level (€182.1 billion). After deduct -
ing redemptions and taking account of changes 
in issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, net do -
mestic bond issuance amounted to €12.4 bil -
lion. Foreign debt securities worth €3.8 billion 
net were placed in the German market. The 
outstanding volume of debt securities in Ger -
many therefore rose by €16.2 billion in April.
In April, the public sector issued bonds totalling 
€9.1 billion net (March: €17.2 billion). Central 
government expanded its capital market debt 
by €7.3 billion. It issued mainly ten- year and 
15- year bonds (Bunds: €7.7 billion and €6.5 bil -
lion respectively), two-  year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze: €4.7 billion) and seven- year 
Federal bonds (Bunds: €3.4 billion). This con -
trasted with net redemptions of five- year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls) amounting to €16.0 billion. 
State and local governments issued debt secur -
ities with a net value of €1.8 billion.
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
increased their capital market debt by €6.0 bil -
lion net, compared with €0.6 billion in the pre -
vious month. Non- financial corporations and 
other financial intermediaries issued bonds for 
€3.2 billion and €2.9 billion net respectively.
By comparison, domestic credit institutions re -
duced their capital market debt by €2.7 billion 
in April, following net issuance of €21.8 billion 
in the previous month. Viewed in net terms, 
the redemptions were attributable solely to 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions (-€4.0 billion). On the other hand, mort -
gage Pfandbriefe and other bank debt secur -
ities that can be structured flexibly saw net is -
suance, albeit at a low volume (€0.7 billion and 
€0.4 billion respectively).The Bundesbank and domestic non- banks 
were, on balance, the sole purchasers in April. 
The Bundesbank acquired bonds amounting to 
€24.1 billion net, predominantly under the 
Euro system’s asset purchase programmes. Do -
mestic non- banks purchased debt securities for 
€19.1 billion net, the vast majority of which 
were foreign instruments (€13.9 billion). By 
contrast, German credit institutions sold bonds 
totalling €17.6 billion net. Non- resident invest -
ors also reduced their holdings of German debt 
securities on balance (-€9.4 billion).
Equity market
In April, domestic enterprises placed €0.9 bil -
lion worth of new shares in the German equity 
market, following €9.0 billion in March. The 
outstanding volume of foreign shares in the 
German market increased by €2.4 billion. On

resident investors trimmed their share port -
folios by €2.4 billion net.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of 
€10.9 billion in April, compared with €13.7 bil-
lion in March. The money benefited predomin -
antly specialised funds reserved for institutional 
investors (€7.7 billion). Of the various asset 
classes, mixed securities funds in particular at -
tracted the most inflows (€7.9 billion), followed 
by equity funds (€2.9 billion), funds of funds 
(€1.1 billion) and open-  end r eal estate funds 
(€0.9 billion). Bond-  based funds, on the other  
hand, recorded outflows of funds (-€2.8 bil -
lion). The outstanding volume of foreign mu -
tual fund shares distributed in the German mar -
ket rose by €9.3 billion in April. German non-  
banks were, on balance, by far the main pur -
chasers of investment fund shares (€17.3 
billion). Foreign investors and German credit in-
stitutions acquired mutual fund shares worth 
€1.6 billion and €1.3 billion net respectively.
Balance of payments
In April 2021, Germany’s current account re -
corded a surplus of €21.3 billion, down €8.7 
billion on the previous month’s level. This was 
driven by the decrease in the goods account 
surplus and a narrowed surplus on invisible cur -
rent transactions, comprising primary and sec -
ondary income as well as services.
In April, the surplus in the goods account fell 
by €6.2 billion on the month to €16.7 billion, 
with goods exports falling more sharply than 
imports.
The surplus in invisible current transactions fell 
by €2.5 billion to €4.6 billion in April, largely 
because net receipts in primary income con -

to non-  r esidents for portfolio investments. By 
contrast, the surplus in services rose slightly by 
€0.7 billion to €2.1 billion. Expenditure declined 
more sharply than receipts, which is also be -
cause expenditure for other business services 
and telecommunications, computer and infor -
mation services decreased more strongly than 
the income they generated. In addition, the 
deficit in secondary income fell by €0.6 billion 
to €3.9 billion, with lower non-  g overnment 
sector expenditure playing a role in particular.
In April 2021, developments in the international 
financial markets continued to be influenced by 
the coronavirus pandemic, but also by the growth outlook brightening in some areas. It was against this backdrop that Germany’s 
cross-  bor der portfolio investment recorded net 
capital exports of €25.4 billion (following net 
capital imports of €4.9 billion in March). Do -
mestic investors added €15.2 billion worth of 
securities issued by non-  r esidents to their port -
folios. They purchased foreign securities in all 
asset classes; mainly mutual fund shares (€9.3 
billion) but also bonds (€2.6 billion), shares 
(€2.1 billion) and money market paper (€1.3 bil -
lion). They primarily invested in bonds denom -
inated in foreign currencies, while divesting 
themselves of long-  dated euro-  denominated  
securities on balance. Conversely, foreign in-
vestors disposed of €10.2 billion net worth of 
German securities, chiefly reducing their hold -
ings of German debt securities (€9.4 billion), in -
cluding both bonds (€5.7 billion) and money market paper (€3.8 billion). They sold public 
sector bonds and acquired long-  da ted secur -
ities issued by the German private sector. For -
eign investors sold shares of German enter -
prises in the amount of €2.4 billion, while 
stocking up on mutual fund shares in Germany to the tune of €1.6 billion. In April, financial de -
rivatives again recorded net capital exports: 
these amounted to €4.7 billion.
Direct investment saw net capital imports of 
€7.3 billion in April (following net capital ex -
ports of €21.7 billion in March). Non-  r esident 
investors injected their affiliated enterprises in 
Germany with direct investment funds worth 
€7.4 billion net. They increased their equity by 
€1.6 billion and provided €5.8 billion via intra-  
group lending. German enterprises made net 
direct investment flows of €0.1 billion abroad. 
The increases they made to their equity capital 
in branches abroad of €5.3 billion were offset 
by negative net lending to affiliates abroad of 
roughly the same amount (€5.2 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net capital imports amounting to €9.9 billion in 
April (following net capital exports of €20.5 bil-
lion in March). Bundesbank accounts also re -
corded net capital imports (€14.5 billion). This 
was caused by a €57.3 billion decrease in 
TARGET2 claims on the ECB; non-  r esidents’ de -
posits with the Bundesbank likewise declined, 
albeit to a lesser extent. Transactions by enter -
prises and households (€3.1 billion) and by gen -
eral government (€2.6 billion) also led to net in-
flows of funds from abroad. Monetary financial 
institutions (excluding the Bundesbank), on the 
other hand, recorded net capital exports (€10.3 
billion).

Outlook for the German economy 
for 2021 to 2023
The German economy is overcoming the coronavirus crisis and is poised for the start of a strong 
upswing. This is contingent on the pandemic being quickly and sustainably suppressed by a suc -
cessful vaccination programme, which will allow protective measures to be swiftly rolled back. As 
a result, households will again have access to opportunities for consumption that were previously 
closed off, and private consumption will see exceptionally strong growth over the rest of this year 
and in 2022 in particular. A portion of the involuntary savings built up during the course of pan -
demic will be spent, giving private consumption an additional boost. In addition to this, the 
upswing will be driven by exports as these benefit from the recovery in global trade, which will 
level off only gradually.
Given these conditions, real gross domestic product (GDP) will grow in calendar- adjusted terms, 
rising by slightly less than 4% this year and just over 5% next year. In 2023, this growth will decel -
erate but still amount to nearly 2%. Pre-  crisis levels will be reattained as early as this summer. 
Aggregate capacity utilisation will reach an above- average level from as early as next year.
This year, the rate of inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) 
will rise strongly to 2.6%. The main factors behind this are value added tax (VAT) rates, which 
were raised back to their previous levels, the newly introduced CO 2 emission certificates, as well 
as the sharp rises in prices for crude oil and food products. It is possible that inflation rates could 
amount to around 4% towards the end of the year. By contrast, the core rate excluding energy 
and food is only likely to stand at around slightly more than 1% – also adjusted for the VAT 
effect – as it had in the previous year. By 2023, it could rise to 1.7% as a result of the upswing, 
the improved labour market situation, and renewed stronger wage growth. As energy and food 
will then no longer exert above- average upward pressure on prices, headline inflation will like -
wise abate to 1.7%.
Public finances will continue to significantly bolster the economy in the current year as well. In 
this context, the deficit and debt ratios will continue to rise to more than 5% and more than 70% 
respectively. They will both then go back down considerably in the coming years, as the economy 
recovers and the fiscal crisis assistance measures expire or are scaled back.
Compared with the December 2020 outlook, considerably higher GDP is expected over the entire 
projection horizon. In line with the stronger upswing, the rate of inflation excluding energy and 
food is projected to also be somewhat higher over this period. Furthermore, headline consumer 
price inflation for this and next year is now expected to be significantly higher mainly because 
energy prices are rising considerably faster than anticipated back in December. While the risks to 
economic growth seem balanced as things stand today, the risks to price developments are tilted 
to the upside.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy continued to suffer due 
to the coronavirus pandemic in the final quar -
ter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. After 
the pandemic situation had reintensified in the 
autumn of 2020, government containment 
measures were considerably tightened once 
again. As during the first wave of the pandemic 
in the spring of 2020, this had a hard impact 
on certain services sectors such as hotel and 
restaurant services, cultural activities, and parts 
of the bricks- and- mortar retail trade sector in 
particular. As opportunities for consumption 
were unavailable, the household saving ratio recently nearly reattained the record level seen 
in the second quarter of 2020. Conversely, pri -
vate consumption, which had previously ex -
perienced a robust recovery, collapsed once 
again. By contrast, economic sectors that were 
not directly affected by the pandemic contain -
ment measures, such as construction and in -
dustry, recorded surprisingly strong expansion. 
The latter benefited from the swift recovery in 
global trade, which was reflected in sharp 
growth in exports. However, the rapidly rising 
demand for industrial goods around the world 
in conjunction with supply- side disruptions led 
to increasing supply bottlenecks for some inter -
mediate goods. Due to a shortage of semicon -
ductors, for example, motor vehicle production 
had to be throttled in the fourth quarter. In the 
final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 
2021 combined, real GDP fell by a total of 1.3% 
after seasonal and calendar adjustment. This 
was a marginally greater decline than had been 
expected in the projection from December 
2020.2 At the beginning of the year, real GDP 
fell short of its pre- crisis level from the fourth 
quarter of 2019 by 5%.
In the second and third quarters of 2021, it is 
likely that the German economy will overcome 
this setback and see strong growth. The num -
bers of coronavirus infections have been in 
considerable decline since the end of April, and 
the pandemic containment measures have, 
with some regional variations, already been 
eased extensively. This projection assumes that 
the pandemic – underpinned by a successful 
vaccination programme in particular – will also 
continue to be quickly and sustainably sup -
pressed going forward. As a consequence, the 
containment measures will probably be further 
eased to a significant extent over the coming 
months. This will result in substantial catch- up 
effects, primarily in private consumption as well 
as in services sectors that had been impacted 
especially hard by the measures. Exports should German eco -

– driven by persistently brisk foreign demand – 
also see additional robust growth. However, 
like industrial production, they are likely to still 
be stifled somewhat by supply bottlenecks for 
intermediate goods, particularly in the second 
quarter. The very favourable overall outlook is 
reflected in the considerable improvement in 
business expectations among German enter -
prises over recent months, as reported by the 
ifo Institute. All in all, GDP could return to its 
pre- crisis level as early as the third quarter of 
2021.
Over the remainder of the projection horizon, it 
is also likely that the German economy will 
grow with great momentum at first. The large 
gains in exports will level off only gradually. 
This, in conjunction with a high level of cap -
acity utilisation in industry, will bolster business 
investment. Above all, however, private con -
sumption will continue to see exceptionally 
strong growth and will remain the key driving 
force behind the robust upswing. This assumes 
that pandemic- related restrictions will expire in 
the first few months of next year. For a time, 
private consumption will then overshoot its ex -
pansionary path resulting from income growth, 
as a portion of the additional savings built up 
during the pandemic will be spent. This surge 
will reverse itself towards the end of the projec -
tion horizon. The saving ratio will then again 
rise slowly from a low starting level, which will 
cause private consumption to grow at a slower 
pace than real disposable household income 
over the course of 2023.3 The latter will rise at 
increasingly faster rates over the projection 
horizon due to improvements on the labour 
market. The fiscal assistance that extensively 
mitigated income losses in 2020 and 2021 will 
mostly expire in 2022.
Overall, this presents a very favourable outlook 
for the German economy: the swift recovery 
from the crisis will continue with an upswing

gradually loses momentum again towards the 
end of the projection horizon. Following the 
massive collapse of 5% last year, calendar-  
adjusted real GDP could be able to make sig -
nificant gains this year and next, growing by 
slightly less than 4% in 2021 and just over 5% 
in 2022. In 2023, this growth will lose momen -
tum but then still amount to nearly 2%. Here, 
looking at the annual averages obscures the 
fact that GDP will rise by almost 5% over the 
course of this year and that annual growth will 
already drop below 3% during next year. In 
comparison with the projection from Decem -
ber 2020, not only will economic output return 
to its pre- crisis level half a year earlier than ex -
pected, but considerably higher GDP is also an -
ticipated for the entire projection horizon. The 
key factor for this is higher foreign demand re -
sulting in greater exports.
As a result of the strong upswing following the 
coronavirus crisis, economic output will exceed 
long- term potential output as early as 2022, 
meaning that aggregate capacity will be util -
ised to an above- average degree. This assumes 
that the pandemic will depress potential output 
at the projection horizon by only slightly less 
than 1%. The growth rate of potential output is 
estimated at 1.0% for this year. In each of the 
next two years, it will then rise to 1.2% primar -
ily as a result of renewed increased expenditure 
for fixed capital formation.
In the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quar -
ter of 2021, exports grew to a considerably 
greater extent than had previously been ex -
pected. Global trade recovered despite the in -
tensification of the pandemic in many coun -
tries, and German industry was met with brisk 
foreign demand. In addition, there was an im -
provement in the medium- term underlying 
conditions as the European Union and the 
United Kingdom reached a trade agreement 
before the end of the year. Furthermore, inter -
national trade relations are likely to have be -
come more predictable following the transition

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. They are based 
on information available as at 18 May 2021. 
The assumptions regarding economic activ-
ity in the euro area are derived from projec-
tions made by the national central banks of 
the euro area countries.1 These projections 
incorporate the fi  scal policy measures which 
have been either adopted or adequately 
specifi  ed and are deemed likely to be imple-
mented.
With regard to the coronavirus pandemic, it 
is assumed that the vaccination campaign 
in the European Union (EU) will continue 
successfully. This means that the contain-
ment measures may be eased quickly over 
the rest of the year and largely elapse in the 
fi  rst months of 2022.
Global economy continues recovery 
 process
Global economic activity recovered more 
quickly in the fi  nal quarter of 2020 than ex-
pected in the December outlook. Although 
resurging infection counts in various re-
gions of the world and the ensuing contain-
ment measures likely had a more consider-
able dampening effect on economic growth 
in the fi  rst quarter of 2021 than previously 
expected, global economic activity is re-
covering as the pandemic is gradually being 
overcome. It is likely to expand further over 
the next two years, albeit at a somewhat 
slower rate than in 2021.
Economic activity in the United States will 
receive a substantial boost from the Ameri-
can Rescue Plan, a comprehensive eco-
nomic stimulus package.2 The trade and co-operation agreement reached with the EU3 
shortly before the end of last year also gives 
reason to expect greater economic growth 
for the United Kingdom over the projection 
horizon than estimated in December.4 It 
had still been assumed back then that the 
negotiating partners would not reach an 
agreement by the end of 2020. China 
quickly brought the pandemic under con-
trol and by the middle of last year had al-
ready returned to its expansionary path ex-
pected before the coronavirus crisis hit. By 
contrast, economic activity in India is likely 
to have seen a sharp downturn in the cur-
rent quarter due to the high numbers of in-
fections. Although a rebound is expected 
by the end of the year, recurrent surges in 
infection counts and sluggish vaccination 
rollouts mean that a rather subdued recov-
ery process is expected for many emerging 
market economies. The outlook for the 
global setting is still subject to a high level 
of uncertainty, especially regarding the fu-
ture global progression of the pandemic.
For the global economy excluding the euro 
area, an increase of 6¼% is estimated this 
year, 4¼% next year and 3¾% in 2023. Fol-
lowing its signifi  cant decline last year, inter-
national trade (excluding the euro area) is 
initially likely to see a relatively strong uptick 
with rates of 10¾% this year and 5% in 
2022. In 2023, global trade is expected to 
grow at 3¾%, representing a return to co- 
movement with global activity.

Progress in combatting pandemic 
 suggests strong euro area recovery
Tight restrictions in the wake of higher in-
fection rates were considerably less of a 
drag on euro area economic activity in the 
last quarter of 2020 and the fi  rst quarter of 
2021 than in the second quarter of last 
year. The decline in activity was even milder 
than expected last December. The restric-
tions mainly affected the services sector, 
whereas the ongoing recovery in global de-
mand provided tailwinds for industry. The 
latter sector is expected to bolster eco-
nomic activity in the euro area over the pro-
jection horizon, too. Now that the vaccin-
ation rollout is progressing and contain-
ment measures are gradually being eased, a 
strong recovery is expected for the second 
half of this year, which will continue in the 
next two years at a somewhat more moder-
ate pace. Private consumption will probably 
play a particular role in this regard, as it is 
expected to recover quickly once house-
holds resume using a larger portion of their 
disposable income for consumer spending as pandemic- related restrictions are lifted.5 
After rising by 5% this year, economic activ-
ity in the euro area (excluding Germany) is 
projected to grow by 4½% in 2022 and by 
2¼% in 2023, which means that a more dy-
namic recovery is expected than in the De-
cember projection.
Although German exporters’ sales markets 
expanded less strongly on average over last 
year than global trade, this is primarily at-
tributable to the drop in imports from the 
United Kingdom in the fi  rst quarter. Over 
the remainder of this year and in 2022, the 
sales markets are likely to recover more dy-
namically than global trade. Growth rates 
will be virtually identical in 2023.
Technical assumptions of the projection
Crude oil prices rose sharply over the fi  rst 
quarter in light of the expected rapid re-
bound in global demand. On average for 
2021, prices will probably be around 50% 
higher than the level assumed in the De-
cember projection. Derived from forward 
quotations, however, a marked decline is 
assumed for the next two years. The prices 
of other commodities as measured in US 
dollars likewise went up steeply, and they 
are also expected to gradually decrease by 
the end of the projection horizon.
The ECB Governing Council shifted to a 
more accommodative monetary policy 
stance in December 2020 given the ex-
pected negative economic impact of a re-
newed increase in infection rates, increas-
ing the envelope for the pandemic emer-
gency purchase programme (PEPP) by €500 Major assumptions of the projection

5 The extent to which savings accumulated owing to 
the pandemic were used to catch up on postponed 
purchases as well as additional or higher- quality ser-
vices may differ across individual Member States. The

billion to a total of €1,850 billion. It also ex-
tended the horizon for net purchases under 
the PEPP to at least March 2022. The ob-
jective of these purchases is to prevent a 
tightening of fi  nancing conditions depend-
ing on market conditions.6 Given the con-
tinued rise in liquidity, interest rates in the 
money market hovered at an all- time low in 
recent months. By contrast, the increasing 
hope that the pandemic will be overcome 
has led, since the beginning of the year, to 
a marked increase in yields on ten- year Fed-
eral bonds (Bunds) via the interest rate link-
age with the United States. These instru-
ments have also seen less demand as a safe 
haven asset. The improved economic out-
look over the forecast horizon has put for-
ward quotations on a stronger upward path 
than in the December outlook. Bank lend-
ing rates are likewise expected to rise grad-
ually. All in all, however, fi  nancing condi-
tions will continue to remain very support-
ive for enterprises and consumers.
Since the conclusion of the December pro-
jection, the euro- US dollar rate has been 
impacted by the pandemic, the progress in 
vaccination and the monetary and eco-
nomic policy measures taken on both sides 
of the Atlantic. In the period underlying the 
exchange rate assumptions, the euro stood 
at US$1.21 and was thus 2½% above the 
fi  gure assumed in the December outlook. 
Compared with 42 currencies of major trad-
ing partners, the euro has appreciated only 
slightly.
Fiscal policy also highly expansionary 
in 2021
Fiscal policy measures will increase the gen-
eral government defi  cit in 2021 by around 
1% of GDP on the year, chiefl  y owing to 
additional structural expenditure. Going 
forward, pressure will be taken off the gov-
ernment budget, especially in 2022 as coronavirus support measures are discon-
tinued.
Coronavirus support measures in the nar-
rower sense are set to weigh heavily on the 
defi  cit in 2021 at 3% of GDP , having ex-
panded slightly compared with 2020. Most 
of these measures will expire in 2022. Guar-
anteed loans and capital injections that are 
only recorded in the debt level are also ex-
pected to decline from 2022. The imput-
ations with regard to the coronavirus sup-
port measures are based on the assump-
tions made regarding the pandemic’s tra-
jectory, containment measures and 
economic growth. In this context, they are 
still well below the Federal budget’s high 
spending authorisations, which comprise 
not only extensive additional across- the- 
board expenditure but also other major 
buffers such as business aid. Nevertheless, 
uncertainty surrounding their use remains 
extremely high.
Besides coronavirus support measures in 
the narrower sense, the outlook also takes 
into account other fi  scal policy measures.

been implementing tax cuts; for example, 
since the start of 2021, the majority of tax-
payers have no longer had to pay the soli-
darity surcharge. Moreover, the income tax 
scale and allowances were adjusted, which 
largely offsets the additional revenue gener-
ated automatically by progressive tax rates. 
Tax amortisation has also been accelerated 
(including for fi  xed assets in information 
and communication technologies).7 By con-
trast, starting in 2021, additional revenue 
will be generated by the new certifi  cates for 
CO2 emissions from transport and building 
heating and by infl  ows from the EU’s Next 
Generation EU (NGEU) programme. Trans-
fers to Germany from NGEU of 0.2% of 
GDP each year have been earmarked for 
2021 to 2023. These will generally be spent 
on existing programmes and in this respect 
will lower the government defi  cit.8 Add-
itional government investment grants (not 
least for climate action and digitalisation), 
higher child benefi  ts and the new basic pension will put pressure on the expend-
iture side from 2021 in particular. With re-
gard to social security funds, it is assumed 
that the Federal Government will again pre-
vent higher contribution rates in 2022 as 
well by means of higher central govern-
ment grants. As things currently stand, 
these are not envisaged for 2023, meaning 
that contribution rates will rise signifi  cantly, 
by 1½% overall through the end of the pro-
jection horizon. This increase will particu-
larly affect additional contribution rates to 
health insurance institutions.

negatively by NGEU, as the expected payments to fund

pectations as reported by the ifo Institute have 
turned around sharply into positive territory 
during recent months. The twelve- month ex -
port expectations surveyed by the German 
Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) are 
also increasingly optimistic and almost returned 
to their long- term average.
Exports are thus generally likely to see con -
tinued strong growth. However, the sharply ris -
ing global demand for industrial goods in con -
junction with supply- side disruptions contrib -
uted to the fact that, in recent times, enter -
prises have complained of increasing delivery 
times and growing shortages of certain com -
modities and intermediate goods. The bottle -
necks for certain semiconductor components 
seem to be especially pronounced. This led to 
production being throttled in the German 
motor vehicle manufacturing industry.4 It 
should be assumed that these tensions will 
abate only gradually over the second and third 
quarters and will continue to dampen export 
growth for a time. However, in the projection, 
it is assumed that the supply- side bottlenecks 
will be resolved towards the end of the year. 
Enterprises should then be able to gradually 
work through their large numbers of orders, 
which will likely give exports an additional 
boost.
The pace of export growth will wane again 
during the further course of the projection 
horizon. At that point in time, growth in global 
trade will be considerably more moderate, and 
German exporters will see a slight loss of mar -
ket share in their sales markets. This holds es -
pecially true for trade with other euro area 
countries, as German enterprises will become 
less competitive in terms of prices due to the 
comparatively sharp rises in labour costs in Ger -
many.
While business investment continued to rise in 
the final quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 
2021, the rate of growth declined significantly 
in comparison with the extraordinarily large 
gains recorded in the third quarter of 2020. In this context, a role was certainly also played by 
the fact that investment in commercial vehicle 
fleets was dampened by sales channels being 
closed off due to pandemic containment meas -
ures as well as, potentially, difficulties regarding 
deliveries in the motor vehicle industry. In the 
second and third quarters of 2021, however, 
business investment should return to stronger 
growth. The pandemic will subside, which will 
reduce uncertainty surrounding sales prospects 
and allow for trade in motor vehicles to be re -
opened. In addition, industrial capacity utilisa -
tion recently rose above its long- term average 
for the first time in two years, meaning that 
capital expenditure on replacement and reno -
vation is becoming increasingly necessary. In 
light of its need to catch up following the 
coronavirus crisis, as well as due to dynamic ex -
ports and a high utilisation rate, business in -
vestment should initially continue to see strong 
expansion going forward, too. Its rate of … but are tem -

growth will likely normalise towards the end of 
the projection horizon.
The pattern of private consumption expend -
iture over time will be heavily influenced by the 
pandemic. In the final quarter of 2020 and the 
first quarter of 2021, private consumption fell 
sharply in light of the difficult situation regard -
ing the pandemic and the stringent measures 
taken to contain it. The more severe limitations 
on opportunities for consumption led once 
again to a surge in the household saving rate. 
During the first wave of the pandemic in the 
spring of 2020, it could already be observed 
that pandemic- related reasons – such as fear of 
infection and, in particular, unavailable oppor -
tunities for consumption  – were the primary 
reasons for spending cuts and involuntary sav -
ing. By contrast, traditional precautionary mo -
tives based on potential losses of income only 
played a subordinate role.5 Private consump -
tion should quickly recover in the second and 
third quarters of 2021. Recently, there has been a considerable decline in the number of corona -
virus infections. Progress in the vaccination 
campaign should sustainably suppress the de -
velopment of the pandemic over the summer, 
enabling containment measures to be relaxed 
further on a broad scale. Consequently, 
pandemic- related reasons for saving will swiftly 
lose significance.
Going forward, private consumption will also 
initially rise significantly faster than suggested 
by disposable household income, and the sav -
ing ratio will drop off rapidly. If, as assumed, all 
noteworthy pandemic- related restrictions have 
been unwound in the first few months of 2022 
and decisions regarding saving and consump -
tion are no longer directly influenced by the 
pandemic, the saving ratio will return to its pre-  
crisis level. It will then continue to fall, as it is as -
sumed that around one- quarter of the involun -
tary savings that were accumulated during the 
pandemic will be used for additional consump -
tion expenditure over the rest of the projection 
horizon (see the box on pp. 25ff.). By the end 
of 2022, the saving ratio will have bottomed 
out and will increase again back towards its 
pre- crisis level. As a result, there will be a per -
ceptible slowdown in the pace of growth in pri -
vate consumption at the end of the projection 
horizon. In the long term, the saving ratio will 
likely reach a similar level to that recorded be -
fore the pandemic. However, this will first occur 
beyond the projection horizon. Only then will 
private consumption again grow more strongly 
in line with disposable income.
The underlying trend in housing investment fol -
lowed a steep upward trajectory in the last 
quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.6

third quarters as the large number of new

Households’ motives for saving during the pandemic and 
their implications for the projection
Over the course of the economic cycle, pri-
vate consumption expenditure normally 
varies less strongly than macroeconomic ac-
tivity. A different picture has emerged dur-
ing the coronavirus crisis, however: against 
the backdrop of the ups and downs caused 
by the pandemic, private consumption ac-
tually even exhibited more pronounced 
swings than gross domestic product (GDP). 
It thus proved a key driver of the fl  uctu-
ations in economic output. Looking at the 
determinants of private consumption re-
veals that this cannot be ascribed to 
changes in households’ available income. 
During the pandemic- induced crisis, dispos-
able incomes were shored up by extensive 
government aid. As these remained stable, 
the cutbacks to spending made by house-
holds occasioned an exceptional rise in the 
saving ratio, particularly in the fi  rst wave of 
infections in the second quarter of 2020 
and again in the fi  nal quarter of 2020 and 
fi  rst quarter of 2021.
The results from the most recent wave of 
the Bundesbank Online Panel Households 
(BOP- HH) survey in March 2021 can be 
used to investigate the reasons behind the 
higher level of savings in the past 12 
months.1 Half of the participants reported 
that over the last 12 months they had had, 
on average, more money left over at the 
end of the month than they did before the 
pandemic. This response was given more 
frequently by participants with higher 
household incomes (and older respond-ents).2 Almost all of these individuals (95%) 
cited restricted opportunities for consump-
tion as a result of measures to contain the 
pandemic –  mandatory store closures or 
travel restrictions, for instance – as a signifi  -
cant reason for their increased saving. In 
addition, just over one in fi  ve respondents 
restricted their expenditure on goods and 
services for fear of contracting coronavirus. 
By contrast, not even one out of every ten 
respondents stated worries about loss of in-
come as a reason for saving more money. 
The gap between this classical precaution-
ary motive and involuntary consumer re-
straint as a result of the pandemic widened

considerably in comparison to the earlier 
survey round in August 2020.3
The fi  ndings from the BOP- HH thus suggest 
a tight link between pandemic activity and 
the saving ratio. Data from the national ac-
counts also reveal a co- movement over 
time. This relationship carries implications 
for the projection: the saving ratio – and 
thus also private consumption – are likely to 
normalise swiftly once falling pandemic ac-
tivity allows for previously unavailable con-
sumption options to be opened up again. 
The projection assumes that pandemic- 
related restrictions will come to an end in 
the opening months of 2022. The saving 
ratio will then return to at least its pre- crisis 
level. Another highly signifi  cant factor is 
whether the savings built up involuntarily 
over the course of the pandemic remain 
parked in household wealth or are used for 
additional consumption. The latter scenario 
raises the question of what the scale and 
timeframe for this spending might be.4
In order to get closer to answering these 
questions, those BOP- HH participants who 
had additional savings owing to the pan-
demic were asked to imagine that the pan-
demic was over. They were then asked 
what they would like to use the extra sav-
ings accrued during the pandemic for. In 
total, 70% of respondents said they would 
spend at least some of their “coronavirus 
savings” on goods and services. The other 
usages are regarded as not directly con-sumptive in nature; no more than one- third 
of individuals chose any one of these other 
usages.5 Since respondents from house-
holds with a higher income probably built 
up more savings during the crisis and those 
with a lower income probably fewer, the re-
sponses were fi  rst weighted by household 
income.6 In the case of multiple responses, 
the survey does not reveal what share of 
savings would be associated with each of 
the use options. The results were therefore 
additionally weighted by usage. Two ex-
tremes were considered.
(1) The fi  rst case assumes that only those 
persons planning to use their extra sav-
ings exclusively to buy goods and ser-
vices will spend their coronavirus sav-
ings. In terms of the share of savings 
being used for additional consumer 
spending, this therefore constitutes the 
lower bound scenario.
(2) The second case assumes that the sav-
ings of each individual are distributed 
evenly across the selected uses. When 
savings are also invested in, for instance, 
real estate or shares, the proportion Reasons for higher level of savings

before the coronavirus pandemic.

3 At that point in time, around one- fi  fth of respond-
ents were still citing classical precautionary motives, 
whereas 49% spent less because opportunities for 
consumption were closed off and 34% because they 
were afraid of catching the virus. In addition, in the 
August 2020 round, reasons for higher savings varied 
more widely by household income and age. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2020b).
4 The additional savings accumulated beyond what 
was anticipated in the December 2019 projection 
could amount to around €210 billion at the end of 
2021.
5 The other possible answers (with the percentage of 
respondents who selected them given in brackets) 
were: invest in real estate (12%), invest in things other 
than real estate – e.g. shares, funds, current account – 
(30%), make gifts (9%), make donations to charitable 
causes (16%), pay off debts (13%), other (25%). Par-
ticipants could choose more than one response.
6 Not only did households with higher incomes more 
frequently have money left over than before the pan-
demic than those with low incomes; they are also 
likely to have involuntarily saved larger sums. Weight-
ing was by the mean for each income bracket relative 
to the mean income across all groups. For details of 
the income groups, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021f), 
p. 25.Deutsche Bundesbank

spent on goods and services is likely to 
be below average. Considered in terms 
of the share of coronavirus savings 
being expended again, this therefore 
constitutes the upper bound.
Overall, this places the share of additional 
savings built up during the pandemic which 
will be used for consumer spending in fu-
ture at a lower bound of 25% and at an 
upper bound of 45%. The midpoint of this 
range, 35%, was set as the baseline for the 
projection. This would mean that the saving 
ratio would fall markedly short of its pre- 
crisis level for a time.
The results of the BOP- HH do not allow us 
to draw any inferences as to what time-
frame this additional consumer spending 
would occur over, however. Higher- income 
households probably account for a large 
portion of the coronavirus savings; they 
could spread additional expenditure –  on 
holidays, for example – over an extended 
period of time. In the light of this, it is as-
sumed here that the saving ratio will drop 
below its pre- crisis level in the fi  rst quarter 
of 2022 and remain there for three years.7
Over a longer horizon, the saving ratio 
should then revert back to a higher fi  gure, 
probably somewhere close to its pre- crisis 
level. Nearly 70% of all people who partici-
pated in the BOP- HH plan to use a similar 
share of their income for consumer spend-
ing as before the pandemic.8 This suggests 
that the pandemic will not have long- lasting 
effects on consumers’ saving and consump-
tion habits.
Given the importance for the projection of 
the assumptions made here, a sensitivity 
analysis was carried out to gauge macro-
economic effects of applying different as-
sumptions as regards the share of savings 
spent and the length of time over which 
this spending occurs. Working on the basis 
of the extremes described above, a fi  rst scenario assumed spending of just 25% of 
coronavirus savings (the lower bound) over 
a longer period of time spanning from 2022 
to 2025. A second scenario posited 45% of 
savings accumulated during the pandemic 
(the upper bound) being expended on con-
sumption within just two years.
The Bundesbank’s macroeconometric model 
was used to simulate how these alternative 
trajectories for private consumption would 
affect GDP and the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP). In line with the pro-
jection baseline, allowance was made for 
the likely prospect of a greater- than- usual 
portion of the consumer spending fi  nanced 
by the additional savings fl  owing into im-
7 This would see just under one- quarter of coronavirus 
savings being eroded over the projection horizon. This 
is in a similar magnitude to the fi  gure applied for the 
December 2020 projection.
8 The remaining answers were almost evenly distrib-
uted: 18% stated that they would increase their con-
sumer spending in the long term, while 13% wish to 
decrease it.Additional savings accumulated owing

the year indicates that demand for housing 
construction remains robust.7 Given the ex -
pected recovery in the labour market, demand 
will probably remain upbeat over the rest of the 
projection horizon, too, which will bolster hous -
ing investment. The persistently favourable 
interest rate environment will provide additional 
stimulus. In addition, some of the savings built 
up involuntarily during the pandemic will be 
used to invest in real estate, giving the latter a 
temporary boost.8 Towards the end of the pro -
jection horizon, housing investment should ex -
pand at a considerably more moderate pace 
owing, amongst other things, to the net decline 
in the number of new households being formed 
as a result of demographic changes.
Government investment will remain dynamic 
this year. More funding is earmarked, in par -
ticular, for transport infrastructure, childcare 
and schools. Growth will subsequently deceler -
ate, not least because local government 
budgets are stretched and a number of invest -ment programmes, such as the fund to pro -
mote municipal investment, are set to expire.
As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, real 
government consumption will increase sharply 
this year, too, driven by additional spending on 
vaccinations and testing. Government con -
sumption will then drop significantly in 2022 as 
spending in response to the pandemic largely 
tails off. At the end of the projection period, 
the ratio of real government consumption to 
GDP will return to a similar level as before the 
coronavirus pandemic in 2019.

This would lessen the impact on GDP . Fur-
thermore, enterprises were assumed to pass 
wage adjustments in response to the altered 
macroeconomic demand through to their 
prices without factoring in any productivity 
effects. This was done to take account of 
the specifi  cities of the current setting, inso-
far as businesses are likely to strive to re-
coup at least part of the profi  ts lost during 
the coronavirus crisis by charging higher 
prices.9 Additional price effects stemming 
from the tight goods market in 2022 and 
2023 assumed in the baseline have not 
been included, however. Note also that the 
price reaction in the model generally occurs 
with a lag. As a result, the impact on the in-
fl  ation rate in the two- year horizon con-
sidered here is comparatively modest only.
In the (fi  rst) scenario premised on the lower 
bound, private consumption climbs less strongly in 2022. Real GDP would fall short 
of the baseline level by around 0.2% in 
both 2022 and 2023. By contrast, in the 
(second) scenario based on the upper 
bound, real GDP would exceed the baseline 
level by around 0.6% in 2022 and would 
still be 0.3% above it in the following year. 
The effects on prices are weaker, mean-
while. In the fi  rst scenario, HICP infl  ation 
would be barely any lower than the base-
line. However, the stronger economic up-
swing in the second scenario leads, with a 
slight lag, to a higher rise in prices. The 
HICP rate would be one- tenth over the 
baseline in 2023. It is clear from the results 
yielded by these simulations that the projec-
tion was pitched cautiously: in the fi  rst 
scenario, the downward deviations from 
the baseline would be smaller than the up-
ward deviations in the second scenario.

economic model, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2019a).
7 Although incoming orders in housing construction 
showed a quarter- on- quarter decline, they were consider -
ably higher than their pre-  crisis level in the fourth quarter 
of 2019. However, shortages in the supply of building ma -
terials, which have recently increased sharply, could hold 
back housing construction.
8 Results from the March 2021 wave of the Bundesbank 
Online Panel Households (BOP- HH) survey suggest that this 
share is substantial, but still smaller in comparison to con -
sumer spending (see the box on pp. 25ff.).Deutsche Bundesbank

Imports will rise sharply during the projection 
period. Their growth will mainly be driven by 
the need for intermediate inputs for the in -
creasing production of export goods and grow -
ing business investment, which also have a par -
ticularly high import content. Moreover, from 
next year, higher household consumption will 
provide a strong stimulus. Households are likely 
to spend some of the savings they have invol -
untarily built up during the pandemic on travel -
ling abroad. This will boost Germany’s services 
imports.
This year, Germany’s current account surplus 
could clock in at around the same level as in 
2020, when it amounted to 6.8% of nominal 
GDP . The trade surplus will decline somewhat 
more perceptibly. This is first and foremost a re -
flection of the substantial deterioration in the 
terms of trade in the wake of higher prices for 
crude oil and other commodities. The timing of 
the recovery of export demand and domestic 
demand will initially go some way towards off -
setting this effect. Although exports have al -
ready been picking up again sharply for some 
time, imports are being held back a little longer 
by limited consumption opportunities. Over the 
remainder of the projection period, especially 
in 2022, domestic demand, and thus also im -
ports, will rise briskly. The current account sur -
plus will fall to just over 6% of GDP .
Labour market
Despite the major resurgence of the pandemic 
and the containment measures subsequently 
taken in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the 
first quarter of 2021, the labour market proved 
extremely stable.9 To adapt to the reduced eco -
nomic activity, working hours were shortened, 
especially through the use of short- time work -
ing arrangements. In the first quarter of 2021, 
on average, around three million employees

again received short- time working benefits to Imports rise

compensate for economic difficulties. In add -
ition, the loss of working hours per short- time 
worker was even higher at the beginning of 
this year than last spring. Employment and un -
employment, on the other hand, remained vir -
tually constant.10 Although the constraints 
stemming from the pandemic in the last quar -
ter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 were 
larger than assumed in the December projec -
tion, all in all, the labour market responded 
more positively than expected at the time.
In the wake of the economic recovery, the la -
bour market will already start to show substan -
tial improvement in the second and third quar -ters of the current year. At first, employees’ 
working hours will go back up significantly as 
short-  time working arrangements are un -
wound and, in some segments, working time 
accounts are replenished and overtime hours 
are worked. On average for 2021, the initially 
depressed level of employment will probably 
cause this year’s level to fall slightly short of last 
year’s. Mirroring employment, unemployment 
is likely to decline at a much brisker pace over 
the next few months. Labour market policy 
measures that were previously sidelined owing 
to the pandemic are expected to be resumed, 
particularly after the summer holidays. This will 
also reduce the number of people registered as 
unemployed. Labour productivity per hour 
worked is likely to recover rapidly.
Strong aggregate demand will probably further 
stimulate the labour market in the course of 
2022. Strong demand for labour will see em -
ployment subject to social security contribu -
tions rise to well over its pre- crisis level. The 
number of hours worked will be expanded sig -
nificantly again and will almost return to its 
level before the pandemic. Unemployment will 
continue to fall rapidly.
The labour supply will rise again markedly in 
2022 following a slight dip in 2020 and 2021. 
During the crisis, a number of people withdrew 
from the labour force. As the recovery takes 
place, most of them are expected to return to 
the workforce as the structural conditions have 
not become significantly worse.11 Immigration

10 Reductions in self- employment and in exclusively low-

tions.
11 Those who withdrew from the labour force were mainly 
people working exclusively in low- paid part- time jobs with 
no claim to unemployment benefits, such as students with 
part- time jobs, and people who took on care duties (pri -
marily women). However, the supply of childcare and nurs -
ing care has not deteriorated structurally as a result of the 
crisis. Opportunities to earn additional income should arise 
again fairly quickly once most of the measures to contain 
the pandemic have been lifted. A number of older employ -
ees will probably have left the labour force permanently, 
however.Deutsche Bundesbank

porary lull. Following net immigration of 
209,000 people in 2020, immigration of 
250,000 people per year is assumed over the 
projection horizon. Including a catching- up ef -
fect, the figure could temporarily hit 300,000 
in 2022. Overall, the number of people in em -
ployment in 2022 is likely to go up again 
slightly more sharply before the effects of 
demographic change slow the pace from 2023 
onwards.
In the last year of the projection period, the 
supply bottlenecks that were already percep -
tible before the crisis are likely to have an im -
pact on the labour market. In the course of 
2023 already, employment growth will prob -
ably hit a wall as the aggregate labour supply 
ceases to expand. Instead, contrary to the 
long- term trend, hours worked per employee 
are expected to continue rising towards the 
end of the projection horizon, too, thus climb -
ing above the level recorded before the start of 
the pandemic. The pandemic is not expected 
to notably impair the functioning of the labour 
market. The large- scale deployment of short-  
time working schemes prevented extensive lay- 
offs and the loss of firm- specific human capital 
during the crisis, thus stopping unemployment 
from becoming entrenched. This helped em -
ployees first and foremost. However, people 
seeking to change careers or sectors, those just 
starting their careers and immigrants are at 
greater risk. Assistance grants and professional 
development measures are particularly helpful 
for these groups. These adjustments will still 
take quite some time. Despite high demand for 
labour, unemployment could therefore still be 
slightly up on its pre- crisis level at the end of 
the projection horizon.
Labour costs and prices
The wage increases recently agreed by wage 
bargainers have been low. Against the back -
drop of the coronavirus crisis, one of the key 
aims was to preserve jobs. Another goal was to 
partner structural change in major industries through the temporary use of collectively 
agreed reductions in working hours. The wage 
increases resulting from the current negoti -
ations and from those scheduled for later this 
year are expected to be low on the whole.12 
Over the next two years, however, higher wage 
settlements will be reached owing to the strong 
economic upturn, which will lead to high cap -
acity utilisation and a marked decline in un -
employment. However, the duration of the pre -
viously concluded agreements containing lower 
wage growth means that this will not be re -
flected in noticeably larger increases in negoti -
ated wages until the last year of the projection 
period.13 Nonetheless, at the same time, nego -
tiated rates of pay will not achieve the same 
strong growth as before the crisis.

12 In major sectors, only a few pay negotiations are sched -

to higher wage settlements than assumed here (see the 
section about the risks on p. 37).

negotiated pay rate statistics (around 500 collective wage 
agreements and provisions governing civil servant pay) are 
factored into the projections of negotiated wage increases. 
They are extrapolated beyond their contractual term, tak -

actual earnings stagnated, chiefly on account 
of the major increase in the use of short- time 
working arrangements. However, they are set 
to recover significantly more rapidly in 2021. As 
short- time work is successively scaled back and 
hours worked therefore gradually increase, ac -
tual earnings will pick up quickly. Wage drift 
will thus return to clearly positive territory 
this  year already. Over the next two years, 
performance- related bonus payments and paid 
overtime resulting from the upbeat economic 
situation will increasingly add to positive wage 
drift. In 2023, actual earnings will also experi -
ence strong growth off the back of rising staff 
shortages. Mounting social security contribu -
tion rates for employers –  especially for the 
statutory health insurance scheme – will then 
raise labour costs (measured by compensation 
per employee) once again.
After rising sharply last year in the wake of the 
crisis, unit labour costs will probably recede 
slightly this year and next. This is a reflection of 
a lagged macroeconomic adjustment process. 
During the crisis, both employment and wages 
remained relatively stable – not least thanks to 
the use of labour market policy instruments. 
Labour productivity per person suffered consid -
erably from the strongly depressed level of eco -
nomic activity. As a result, unit labour costs 
soared. This was offset by a sharp drop in ag -gregate profit margins. During the subsequent 
recovery, economic activity will already start to 
expand strongly this year, while wage growth 
will remain subdued for a little longer. This will 
allow unit labour costs to return to normal. At 
the same time, profit margins will show an al -
most identical recovery this year and next. In 
2023 unit labour costs will then go back up 
markedly and enterprises could expand their 
profit margins again slightly in the light of the 
favourable macroeconomic environment. Be -
cause fluctuations in unit labour costs are 
largely cushioned by profit margins over the 
entire projection horizon, domestic inflation as 
measured by the GDP deflator will vary rela -
tively little. However, it will be fairly perceptible. 
In 2023, the GDP deflator could go up by al -
most 2%.
In the first quarter of 2021, consumer price in -
flation (as measured by the HICP) surged from 
-0.6% in the previous quarter to +1.7%. Among 
the factors that contributed to this were the 
end of the VAT rate reduction and the new CO 2 
emission certificates. The magnitude of these 
effects was roughly as expected in the Decem -
ber projection.14 What came as a surprise, by 
contrast, was a statistical one- off effect which 
resulted from the annual adjustment to the 
weighting of the individual HICP components 
and which had a stronger impact than usual 
owing to the coronavirus crisis.15 This one- off 
effect raised headline inflation by just over 
0.3  percentage point in the first quarter of 
2021. Besides this, prices for crude oil and Actual earnings

raised significantly. Second, supported by additional rev -
enue stemming from the higher carbon price, a cap was 
placed on the levy imposed by the German Renewable En -
ergy Act (Erneuerbare- Energien- Gesetz – EEG), which is an 
important component of energy prices, for 2021 and 2022, 
with the prospect of additional relief for 2023. Taking these 
measures together, the inflation rate could rise by 0.3 per -
centage point in 2021.

– owing to the unusually cool weather in the 
second quarter  – also those for agricultural 
products went up unexpectedly. This meant 
that in May, too, the inflation rate exceeded 
the expectations of the December projection 
by just over one-  half percentage point.16 But 
core inflation (excluding energy and food), 
which is expected to stand at 1.6%, was also 
up by a quarter of a percentage point on the 
previous projection. This is primarily attribut -
able to a stronger than anticipated rise in prices 
for industrial goods excluding energy.
In the second half of the year, the annual infla -
tion rate will probably rise steeply. This is pri -
marily linked to the price- driving base effect of 
the temporary reduction in the VAT rates the 
year before. Although the statistical one- off ef -
fect mentioned above will drag down inflation 
from July to October, it will then have an amp -
lifying effect in November.17 Overall, as things 
stand, at the end of the year, inflation rates 
could briefly hit the 4% mark.
In 2021, inflation is likely to stand at 2.6% on 
an annual average. Energy, in particular, will 
become more expensive, as will food. The rate 
excluding energy and food will climb from 
0.7% to 1.6% in 2021 owing to the change in 
VAT rates. Factoring out tax effects, the rate 
would probably stand at just over 1%, as was 
the case last year, which is significantly lower 
than in 2019 (+1.4%). A key factor is the 
delayed, price-  dampening impact of the re -
duced aggregate demand. It will not be offset 
by higher prices for commodities and increased 
transport costs, which are primarily reflected in 
industrial goods excluding energy.
In 2022, core inflation could be almost as high 
as in 2021, despite the absence of the one- off 
effects. One major reason for this is the above- 
average degree of overall capacity utilisation. In 
addition, there are likely to be lagged adjust -
ments to the higher commodity prices. In 2023, 
wage growth and capacity utilisation will in -
crease somewhat. Against this backdrop, the 
core rate may climb further.The headline inflation rate is likely to continue

fects largely wear off.18 However, energy and 
food prices will probably still see above- average 
growth as consumer prices are responding to 
this year’s price increase for crude oil and agri -
cultural products with a (partial) lag. As a re -
sult, the headline inflation rate will remain sig -
nificantly above the core rate. This gap is not 
set to close until 2023, when both rates will 
stand at 1.7% according to the projection. Al -
though food prices will rise by more than aver -
age due to higher wage increases, energy 
prices will see below- average growth. Here, 
the dampening effect of the assumed decline 
in crude oil prices will prevail over the con -
tinued rise in CO 2 prices and rising forward 
rates for electricity.
Public finances
Public finances have continued to provide sig -
nificant support to the economy in 2021. On 
the back of this, the general government budget deficit will rise to around 5½% of GDP 
(2020: 4½% of GDP). This increase is primarily 
attributable to measures unrelated to the 
coronavirus pandemic. For instance, the partial 
abolition of the solidarity surcharge and the in -
creased child benefits are boosting households’ 
disposable income. Furthermore, government 
grants are encouraging private investment in 
climate action. The fiscal stabilisation brought 
about by temporary one- off coronavirus-  
related measures will increase slightly. How -
ever, the fact that the cyclical impact on the 
government budget is set to be somewhat less 
negative than in 2020 will have a deficit-  
reducing effect.19 Public finances will respond 
to the economic rebound with a lag over the 
course of the year, chiefly due to wage and la -
bour market developments, which are particu -
larly relevant for the government budget.
According to this projection, the deficit is then 
set to fall significantly to 1½ of GDP in the 
coming year. This is because coronavirus-  
related measures will largely have been un -
wound as the crisis has broadly been over -
come. In addition, the economic upswing will 
provide substantial relief for government fi -
nances, and the cyclical impact on the govern -
ment budget will be slightly positive. In 2023, 
the deficit will fall a little further. This is due, in 
particular, to steeply increasing contribution 
rates for the statutory health insurance scheme.
Compared with the pre- crisis year of 2019, the 
structural situation of government finances will 
be less favourable at the end of the projection 
horizon: the structural surplus of ½% of GDP in 
2019 will turn into a structural deficit (some -Headline infla -

19 In times of crisis it is especially difficult to gauge cyclical 
influences on the government budget. This holds, not 
least, for profit- related taxes; they usually respond to eco -
nomic developments with, in some cases, a time lag. How -
ever, as things currently stand, the models used to estimate 
the cyclical impact on the government budget are likely to 
respond too slowly as, for instance, enterprises’ advance

where in the region of 1½% of GDP).20 A key 
factor here is that pension and healthcare ex -
penditure as well as investment grants are ris -
ing steeply. Around one- third of the structural 
deficit is attributable to social security funds, 
primarily the pension insurance scheme. The 
deficit also anticipated for the next few years in 
this area will then have to be offset by higher 
contribution rates, according to the current 
rules, because the reserves will largely have 
been exhausted.
The debt ratio is set to rise to over 70% this 
year (2020: 69.7%). This is attributable, first 
and foremost, to the high central, state and 
local government deficits. In addition, in light 
of the generous draft budget, it is assumed 
that central government’s cash reserves will in -
crease further still. This rise will be reined in by 
nominal GDP growth in the denominator and 
the continued deleveraging of state-  owned 
bad banks’ portfolios. The debt ratio will subse -
quently decline to around 65% by 2023. Al -
though deficits are anticipated for the next few 
years, these will then be significantly lower. 
Furthermore, coronavirus- related one- off ef -
fects (assistance loans, equity injections and 
higher cash reserves) will be scaled back to 
some degree, and the portfolios of state-  
owned bad banks will continue to shrink. 
Lastly, the nominal GDP growth in the denom -
inator will significantly depress the debt ratio.
Risk assessment 
The German economic growth and consumer 
price inflation outlook presented here is subject 
to various uncertainties. The future trajectory 
of the pandemic and its macroeconomic con -
sequences remain difficult to assess. However, 
chiefly on account of the ongoing vaccination 
campaign, uncertainty in this area has already 
decreased substantially. In contrast to the two 
macroeconomic projections from June and De -
cember 2020, therefore, no alternative scen -
arios with different assumptions regarding the development of the pandemic were prepared 
for Germany.21
However, uncertainties surrounding the indir -
ect repercussions of the pandemic and the im -
minent recovery phase are now coming to the 
fore. No historical benchmark exists for this 
situation, either, and surprises are to be ex -
pected. The effect of the reopening of many 
economic sectors on the price outlook is par -
ticularly uncertain. All in all, the risks appear to 
be more or less balanced from today’s perspec -
tive, while the risks to the inflation outlook are 
tilted to the upside.
With regard to the direct impact of the pan -
demic, risks materialising in the short term can 
be identified in both directions. Depending, 
first and foremost, on how the vaccinations 
progress, non- medical containment measures 
could either be withdrawn earlier and on a Debt ratio to

21 In the Eurosystem’s June projection, scenarios for the 
euro area as a whole based on different assumptions re -
garding the pandemic and the impact of the coronavirus 
crisis on potential output in the long term were calculated 
(see European Central Bank (2021)). The macroeconomic 
implications of these various scenarios for Germany will 
probably, on the whole, be similar to those for the euro 
area in its entirety.Deutsche Bundesbank

broader basis, or remain in place for longer and 
on a larger scale. Significant setbacks could 
occur over the entire projection horizon if the 
virus mutates in a way that substantially re -
duces the efficacy of the vaccine. The longer it 
takes to overcome the pandemic on a global 
scale, the greater this risk will be. Quite aside 
from weaker foreign demand, immediate pro -
tective measures could also then impair the 
German economy once again.
In terms of recovery in the sectors affected by 
the restrictions, the speed at which currently 
inaccessible consumption opportunities open 
up once more is not the only relevant factor. 
The degree to which consumers use these 
again also plays an important role. Pent- up de -
mand could be released sooner and more 
strongly overall in the event that households 
spend the additional savings they have accu -
mulated during the pandemic more quickly or 
on a larger scale, for instance. The model-  
based simulation results suggest that the pro -
jection has been pitched relatively cautiously in 
this regard. Should this be the case, economic 
activity, in the first instance, but also inflation 
may be higher (see the box on pp. 27 f.). How -
ever, note that there is significant sectoral vari -
ation in terms of postponed consumption and 
the competition situation. Specifically in the 
sectors that have been subject to lengthy re -
strictions, short- term peaks in demand and 
supply shortages could trigger additional price 
surges. This would be especially true if the cri -
sis resulted in more insolvencies than expected, 
dampening supply in the short term and in -
creasing market concentration in the medium 
term.
Tensions resulting from renewed demand after 
the crisis are currently making waves in global 
industry. In Germany, too, increasing delivery 
times and rising prices for important commod -
ities and intermediate goods are hindering re -
covery and generating cost pressure at the up -
stream input stages, impacting on consumer 
prices. Should global supply bottlenecks dissi -

output could return to a higher level sooner. 
However, if these shortages are prolonged, re -
covery may be more subdued and consumer 
prices could simultaneously climb more steeply.
Many economies worldwide are currently in a 
similar situation to that of Germany. Should the 
economic recovery in key partner countries 
overshoot expectations, the German economy 
would generally profit from this due to its 
strong focus on exports. At the same time, 
though, some risks to the world economy 
would increase – the global recovery from the 
coronavirus crisis is already occurring at a highly 
uneven pace. While some economies such as 
those of the United States, the United Kingdom 
and China largely have the pandemic under 
control, this is far from the case in many emer -
ging market economies. The resulting asym -
metries are being exacerbated significantly fur -
ther still by, in some cases, vast differences in 
the degree of monetary and fiscal policy expan -
sion. They could, for example, create turmoil 
with negative real economic feedback loops on 
the financial markets. Taken in isolation, there -
fore, the asymmetries entail downside risks to 
the outlook for both the global and the Ger -
man economies. Given a more dynamic pace 
of recovery in the leading economic areas, 
these risks could intensify.
The sharp upturn in global demand also meant 
that the crude oil price, which had slumped at 
the start of the pandemic, made a strong re -
covery. The projection is based on the assump -
tion that the crude oil price will fall noticeably 
from its elevated level again over the projection 
horizon in line with forward prices. This places 
a significant dampener on the projected price 
increase and contrasts somewhat with the ex -pected continuation of the global economic re -
covery. If oil prices remain at their current level 
or rise further – in the wake of a potentially 
even stronger expansion of the global econ -
omy, for example – the inflation rate will be 
higher.
Greater risks to the outlook for more steeply in -
creasing energy prices are likely to result from 
climate action policy. Following a fundamental 
ruling from the Federal Constitutional Court, 
the Federal Government recently substantially 
increased Germany’s climate targets. However, 
the necessary measures have not yet been spe -
cified. The existing fixed price for CO 2 emission 
rights could conceivably be significantly in -
creased in the near future, for example. These 
or similar measures would increase energy 
prices further.22 The implications for economic 
growth during the projection horizon largely 
depend on the extent to which climate policy is 
coordinated with international partners, and 
how additional government receipts are put to 
use.
The exceptionally high inflation rates by Ger -
man standards projected for the second half of 
2021 could ultimately shift economic agents’ 
inflation perceptions and expectations. As a re -
sult, wage and price- setting behaviour could 
change and exert further inflationary pressure. 
This would especially be the case if headline 
price inflation in the near future were to be 
even higher than estimated here in the light of 
the existing upside risks.Upside risks if

Government finances: Central bank bond 
purchases increase sensitivity to interest 
rate changes
In the euro area, the current very low interest rate level is creating favourable funding conditions 
across all maturities. This is probably one of the reasons why the euro area countries have increas -
ingly taken on longer- term debt. In doing so, they have better protected themselves against the 
impact of short- term interest rate rises. At the same time, however, it is important to bear in mind 
that the central banks’ extensive bond purchases are ultimately increasing the interest rate sensi -
tivity of government finances.
On the one hand, central banks’ bond holdings generate interest income during the holding 
period; on the other, bond purchases lead to deposits from commercial banks (subject to a short- 
term interest rate) with the central bank. If the interest on assets (bond holdings) is higher than 
that on liabilities (deposits), net interest income is positive (and negative if the reverse is true). This 
initially increases the central bank’s profits and, through its profit distribution, government rev -
enue too. If the deposit rate rises, net interest income falls in the short term, thus also reducing 
the central bank’s potential profit distribution. An interest rate reversal may also lead to balance 
sheet losses.
The specific payments that central banks make to their national governments depend on various 
factors, including balance sheet risk provisioning. For example, provisions for interest rate risk or 
default risk change the timing of such payments. As a case in point, some central banks (includ -
ing the Bundesbank) distributed little or no profits for the year 2020, instead topping up their pro -
visions as a precautionary measure.
In view of the policy decisions applicable at present, the Eurosystem central banks are likely to 
expand their balance sheets and significantly increase their already large government bond hold -
ings. Next year, the public bond holdings of member countries and supranational entities in the 
Eurosystem could thus come close to 40% of gross domestic product (GDP). This is likely to be 
accompanied by a further rise in deposits from commercial banks.
In a sense, the euro area countries are paying the medium to long- term market rates on their 
national central bank’s holdings of their bonds to themselves; consequently, the effective funding 
costs for this component of government debt ultimately depend on the Eurosystem’s short- term 
interest rate. The more unfavourable a member country’s current funding conditions on the cap -
ital market, the more financially advantageous this is. At the same time, it makes the government 
budgets of all euro area countries more dependent on changes in the short- term interest rates.Deutsche Bundesbank

Interest developments affect 
government budgets
Through interest expenditure, government 
debt places an ongoing burden on government 
budgets. The debt ratio in the euro area has 
seen a sharp rise, particularly in the wake of the 
financial and economic crisis of 2008-09 and in 
the current coronavirus crisis. By contrast, inter -
est expenditure has continued to decline. This 
is mainly because euro area countries have 
been able to access very cheap funding for 
some years now – in recent years, sometimes 
even at negative interest rates. This has also 
caused the average interest rate on govern -
ment debt to fall to record lows (see the chart 
below).
The impact of the current funding conditions 
on interest expenditure depends on the level of 
new borrowing as well as on the volume and 
structure of the debt securities that need to be 
refinanced. The residual maturity structure thus plays a key role in the interest sensitivity of 
public budgets. Short- term debt is often rolled 
over, i.e. replaced with new debt. The shorter 
the maturity of outstanding fixed rate liabilities, 
the faster interest expenditure responds to 
changes in funding conditions. It also reacts 
quickly if liabilities have longer maturities but 
variable interest rates.1 In addition, longer- term 
fixed rate liabilities can, for example, be tied to 
a variable interest rate via derivatives (such as 
interest rate swaps), or vice versa.
Through their debt management, governments 
can thus influence how strongly interest rate 
changes affect their budgets in the short term. 
For example, if a government borrower wants 
to secure a current low interest rate for the 
long term, it may make sense for it to issue 
more debt securities with a longer interest fix -
ation period. A longer maturity is usually ini -
tially associated with higher average interest 
rates. On the other hand, there is then a cor -
responding lag before rising – or falling – inter -
est rates are reflected in interest expenditure. 
This means that governments have more time 
to respond to a general or country-  specific 
interest rate increase. Government finances 
with lower interest sensitivity can also help to 
reduce the pressure on monetary policy to 
keep government funding costs low. As gov -
ernment debt is currently very high in some 
countries and funding conditions are very fa -
vourable, it is understandable that many gov -
ernments are further lengthening the maturity 
structure of their debt. Since the launch of 
monetary union, the average residual matur -
ities of euro area government bonds had al -
ready risen noticeably (see the chart on p. 41

States).Interest burden

again if the debt security needs to be refinanced at matur -

Interest burden influenced 
by central banks’ bond 
 purchase programmes
In addition to the debt structure, central banks’ 
bond purchase programmes are also influen -
cing the government debt burden.2 In effect, 
the impact of these programmes is similar to a 
reduction in the interest rate fixation period for 
government debt. The main factor at play here 
is the balance sheet connection between the 
central bank and government finances. Gov -
ernment bond purchases influence central 
banks’ profits and hence their payments to the 
government. This balance sheet connection 
thus does not change the government’s inter -
est expenditure but it does change its revenue 
(from the central bank’s profit distribution and, 
in some cases, also tax payments from the cen -
tral bank).
The basic mechanisms at work are illustrated 
below using the example of the Eurosystem.3 
The European Central Bank and the national 
central banks have been purchasing govern -
ment bonds on a large scale, particularly via the 
public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and 
the pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP).4 Further purchases are envisaged for the 
coming months. Next year, the public bond 
holdings of member countries and supra -
national entities in the Eurosystem could thus 
come close to 40% of GDP .5 The vast majority 
are accounted for by the national central banks; 
their PSPP and PEPP holdings primarily com -
prise the debt securities of their own countries, 
and they alone bear the associated default 
risk.6 The resulting interest income effectively 
accrues to the respective national central bank.7
The bond purchases8 are affecting central 
banks’ balance sheet structure and profits. 
They have a broad maturity range, with the 
average residual maturity of the PSPP and PEPP 
holdings across the entire Eurosystem coming 
to around seven and a half years at the end of 
2020. The government bond portfolios gener -
ate interest income, which accrues either until De facto short -

side …2 Central bank government bond purchases have a variety 
of economic effects on the interest rate level for govern -
ment bonds. In this article, however, the focus is limited to 
the balance sheet connection between the government 
and the national central bank and the associated effects on 
government finances.
3 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2017).
4 See European Central Bank (2015a, 2020a). Furthermore, 
the Eurosystem is still holding government bonds acquired 
under the securities markets programme (SMP), which ran 
from 2010 to 2012. Various Eurosystem national central 
banks are also holding government bonds for non-  
monetary policy purposes. See also Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2016).
5 PSPP purchases of euro area government bonds are 
guided by the ECB capital key on a stock basis. However, 
the capital key is not only based on a member country’s 
GDP share (currently the average of the years from 2011 to 
2015) but also on its population size (as at 2016). As part 
of the expansion of purchases introduced by the PEPP in 
2020, a more flexible purchase approach guided by the 
capital key is temporarily being applied. By the end of the 
PEPP purchase horizon, temporary deviations are to be 
evened out again, however.
6 See European Central Bank (2015b). As agreed, this ap -
plies to 80% of the PSPP/ PEPP volume. Around 10% is held 
by national central banks in the form of supranational 
bonds, whose income contributes to the Eurosystem’s 
profit and is distributed according to the capital key; the 
same applies to the ECB’s direct purchases, which make up 
approximately 10% of the PSPP/  PEPP volume, and to the 
SMP holdings.
7 For the purposes of the Eurosystem’s general profit distri -
bution based on the capital key, the main refinancing rate 
– not the effective interest rate – is applied to government 
bond holdings. See European Central Bank (2016), last 
amended by European Central Bank (2020c).
8 If, instead of national government bonds, the central 
bank purchases other balance sheet- lengthening assets at 
its own risk (such as corporate bonds (with risk sharing)), 
governments become more tightly bound to the short-  
term interest rate. With risk sharing, however, interest in -
come from purchases is distributed differently within the 
Eurosystem.Deutsche Bundesbank

the bonds are sold or over their entire residual 
maturity. The effective interest rate results from 
the coupon and the difference between the 
purchase price and the repayment amount (the 
chart above provides information on central 
banks for which the relevant data have been 
published).9
Above all, the bond purchases increase excess 
liquidity. This means that, in effect, the bal -
ances that banks hold on their deposit ac -
counts with national central banks exceed their 
respective minimum reserve requirement (see 
the chart below for developments in the Euro -system).10 The interest rate on this excess li -
quidity currently corresponds to the Eurosys -
tem’s deposit rate.11 The deposit rate was posi -
tive until 2012 and was mostly 1 percentage 
point below the refinancing rate. In mid- 2012, 
the deposit rate was lowered to 0%, and it has 
stood at -0.5% since September 2019.
The impact of expanding central bank balance 
sheets12 is twofold. On the one hand, central 
banks’ interest income goes up. This income is 
thus largely tied to yields on medium to longer- 
term government bonds (at the time of pur -
chase), and is even negative in some Member 
States. On the other hand, it generates interest 
expenditure, which is based on the short- term 
deposit rate and is therefore currently negative 
for all central banks across the board. This type 
of maturity transformation generally drives up 
central bank profits at first because the deposit 
rate is usually lower than the interest rate on 
medium to longer- term government bonds.
If interest rates (and with them, the deposit rate) 
rise, central banks’ net interest income falls as a 
direct result: while interest income on the hold -
ings of longer- term bonds initially remains more 
or less stable, interest expenditure rises directly 
with the deposit rate. In such a case, central 
bank profits thus respond quickly to changes in … versus short-

9 For the profit and loss account, amounts resulting from a 
premium/ discount are allocated over the term of the bond 
on an accruals basis.
10 The bond purchases could, in principle, also have other 
balance sheet effects. For example, if banks still funded 
themselves to a large extent via regular Eurosystem refinan -
cing operations at the main refinancing rate of 0%, their 
volume could be expected to initially decline – before the 
banks end up holding funds on their central bank account 
and paying an interest spread. However, the volume of 
regular refinancing operations underwent a significant de -
cline quite some time ago. At present, the government 
bond purchases are effectively increasing excess liquidity 
on a broadly similar scale.
11 As long as it exceeds six times the minimum reserve re -
quirement, which is relatively low. Unlike with income from 
government bonds, interest expenditure on (currently, 
interest income from) deposits with the national central 
banks is distributed within the Eurosystem according to the 
ECB’s capital key – regardless of which central bank holds 
the deposits in the form of excess liquidity.
12 Balance sheets are expanded when a transaction affects 
both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet to 
the same extent, increasing the balance sheet total overall.Deutsche Bundesbank

interest rates. An interest rate reversal may then 
even lead to negative net interest income. Both 
the extent of the interest rate rise and the vol -
ume of bond holdings have a role to play here. 
For a transitional period, the reduced current in -
come lasts for as long as central banks still have 
legacy holdings of bonds bearing relatively low 
interest. Higher income may be on the cards 
going forward if maturing bonds are to be refi -
nanced at higher rates of interest.13
The government participates in the risks and 
earnings of a central bank’s activities through 
profit transfer. Euro area central banks’ distribu -
tions are largely destined for their own govern -
ment.14 The funds distributed are usually cen -
tral bank profits, but in some cases there are 
special circumstances.15 In some Member 
States (for instance France and Italy), central 
bank profits are taxed. In this case, they are 
passed on to the government partly as tax pay -
ments and partly as profit transfers. There may 
also be time lags in transferring central bank 
profits. For instance, risk provisions may be 
built up or released, thus lowering or raising 
the annual profit.16 Any losses that may arise 
can be offset against future profits or capital 
injections  from the government.17 Ultimately, 
fluctuations in central bank income are passed 
through to government finances.
The link between government and central bank 
balance sheets means that the medium to 
long- term fixed interest rates on government 
bonds held by central banks are, in effect, 
transformed into a variable interest rate. If, for 
the sake of simplicity, the government and cen -
tral bank are considered as one entity, the gov -
ernment is effectively no longer receiving fund -
ing –  in the amount of the fixed rate bonds 
held by the central bank – from the yields on its 
bonds. Instead, it is ultimately charged the de -
posit rate for this portfolio.18 If the financial 
market applies a risk premium for government 
bonds, the government, in effect, pays itself 
the premium. Governments with poorer mar -
ket valuations then do not receive these risk 
premia in the amount of their central bank’s government bond purchases. These effects also 
apply if the central bank purchases variable rate 
or very short-  term government bonds and is 
therefore not bound by the lower fixed interest 
rates described above.
Relief varies
As a concrete example, yields on German gov -
ernment bonds reported on the Bundesbank’s 
2020 balance sheet were slightly negative 
(average of -0.1%).19 Given the difference to 
the deposit rate of -0.5%, the PSPP and PEPP 
government bond holdings can be estimated 
to have yielded a profit contribution of roughly 
€2 billion in 2020. The extremely low, almost 
risk- free medium to long- term yields have ef -
fectively been transformed into interest at an 
even lower, risk- free central bank rate.
However, a whole host of other income and 
expenditure is associated with the distributable 
balance sheet profit.20 Given the potential … and profit

14 Some central banks (e.g. those in Italy and Belgium) 
also have private shareholders that participate in profits, 
too. However, their share of the distributions is much 
smaller than that of the government.
15 Central bank profits are also dependent on a number of 
other factors, including institutional and legal requirements 
as well as accounting standards. These requirements also 
have a bearing on decisions relating to setting up provi -
sions, and ultimately determine the discretionary scope for 
central bank management.

ernment bonds under the PSPP and PEPP (mean of hold -

were, in some cases, below -0.5%.
20 In 2020, the profit was hit particularly hard by negative 
interest income from refinancing operations with banks at 
favourable interest rates (targeted longer- term refinancing 
operations, or TLTROs). These operations enable banks, 
under certain conditions, to obtain liquidity via longer- term 
refinancing operations that bear even more favourable 
interest rates than the deposit rate (even further into nega -
tive figures). See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021), pp. 54 ff.

losses due, inter alia, to changes in interest 
rates, the provisions were topped up by €2.4 
billion using model- based calculations. On bal -
ance, the Bundesbank did not distribute any 
profit in 2020 and announced a further in -
crease in the risk provisions for the current 
year.21
In other Member States, the profit contribution 
from government bond purchases is consider -
ably higher in some cases. The market called 
and still calls for risk premia in the form of 
interest surcharges. At the end of the day, in 
such cases, it is the national central bank that 
takes on default risk and receives the risk pre -
mia.22 Ultimately, there could be several rea -
sons for differences in the amounts of profit 
that national central banks transfer to the gov -
ernment (profit distribution and payments of 
profit- related taxes). However, the varying rates 
of interest paid on government bond purchases 
play a major role. The highest profit distribu -tions last year amounted to almost ½% of GDP 
(Italy and Greece, see the adjacent table).23
National central banks’ net income from gov -
ernment bond purchases could grow further 
going forward. Holdings increased last year. 
Moreover, the framework agreed for the PSPP 
and PEPP was far from exhausted at the end of 
2020. However, the market yield on govern -
ment bonds in the euro area is currently still 
somewhat lower than in previous years.
However, if monetary policy takes on a new, 
less expansionary stance, things could change. 
Rising deposit rates would lead to pressure on 
earnings in the short term and then eat into or 
eat up profits from purchasing bonds – if no 
risk provisions have been set up already as a 
precautionary measure. If interest rates were to 
rise, bond sales would also result in losses, in 
particular for long- term securities. This, too, 
would have an impact on central bank profits 
and, at the least, lower potential profit distribu -
tion for an extended period of time. Depending 
on its scale, an interest rate reversal can even 
lead to negative annual results. For instance, a 
one percentage point rise in the deposit rate 
and excess liquidity of 40% of GDP , amid other -
wise unchanged conditions, would directly re -
sult in additional annual interest expenditure of 
0.4% of GDP for central banks. This would 
mean around €48 billion for the euro area as a 
whole each year, and €14 billion for Germany.

Effective maturity trans-
formation makes govern -
ment finances more sensitive 
to changes in interest rates
All in all, through various channels and lower 
interest rates, Eurosystem bond purchases help 
to ease the burden on government finances. In 
the current low interest rate environment, gov -
ernments are often advised to extend matur -
ities and increasingly turn to long- term bonds. 
A trend is this direction can indeed be ob -
served. The intention behind this is to secure 
low interest rates for the long term. However, it 
is all too often neglected that a central bank’s 
government bond purchases have the same ef -fect as shortening the average interest rate 
lock- in period. Through the link between gov -
ernment and central bank balance sheets, as 
soon as bonds are purchased, they effectively 
switch from the medium to long- term market 
conditions to the risk- free central bank interest 
rate. Taken in isolation, the short- term fiscal 
advantage of central bank purchases is there -
fore greater the more expensive a country’s 
market financing. At the same time, the gov -
ernment budgets of all euro area countries be -
come increasingly dependent on changes in 
the short- term interest rates. This counteracts 
the extended maturity structure of government 
bonds.Government

Federal debt: allocate premia on accruals 
basis in budgetary interest expenditure
In recent years, the Federal Government’s interest expenditure has fallen sharply. This was largely 
due to the lower interest rate level. However, another factor was that interest expenditure is not 
recorded on an accruals basis in the Federal budget. This primarily concerns premia on new 
securities at the time of issue.
Premia accrue when a security’s coupon is higher than the market interest rate. This premium on 
the redemption price is paid when the security is purchased. The greater the difference between 
the coupon and market rate, and the longer the interest rate lock- in period of the security, the 
higher the premium becomes.
These premia are recorded in the Federal budget immediately and in full as negative interest 
expenditure, and only the coupon payments are subsequently recorded over the remaining term. 
As a result, interest expenditure is not spread evenly (on an accruals basis) over the term. Using 
this accounting practice, premia ease the pressure on debt brake limits in the short term, at the 
expense of future budgets. Interest expenditure and hence budget outturns become both more 
volatile and more difficult to rank.
The volume of premia received in the Federal budget has risen sharply in recent years. In the dec -
ade up to 2010, they averaged €½ billion; in the last decade they came to €4 billion. A peak of 
almost €12 billion was reached in 2020, equating to 2½% of total expenditure in the Federal 
budget. The premia received thus reduced reported interest expenditure by just under two- thirds.
Switching to recording interest expenditure on an accruals basis in future would be more appro -
priate from an economic perspective, and would have a number of other advantages. It should 
be possible to make the switch without any major difficulties. This would make it easier to iden -
tify the actual budgetary situation. The interest burden on budgets would be stabilised, while 
budget outturns could be better planned as well as becoming less erratic. The switch would also 
be more in keeping with the intention of the debt brake, doing away with one possibility of cir -
cumventing it. Lastly, changing the way in which premia are recorded would also better ensure 
compliance with the European rules.Deutsche Bundesbank

How premia arise when 
 issuing securities
The Federal Government can close funding 
gaps in its budget by issuing debt, for which 
upper limits are set by the fiscal rules. At the 
end of 2020, the debt level in the Federal Gov -
ernment’s core budget (as defined by the Sta -
bility Council) came to €1,163 billion, or 35% of 
gross domestic product. The vast majority of 
this Federal debt is attributable to securities is -
sued in the capital market. These securities 
have to pay interest commensurate with mar -
ket conditions at the time of issue. Amounts 
falling due annually are usually paid in the form 
of fixed coupons.1 For Treasury discount paper 
with maturities of up to one year (Bubills), 
interest is paid as the difference between the 
issue price and par value.2 For inflation- linked 
securities, such payment is made in addition to 
the coupons by adjusting the redemption 
amount to the price index performance. In the 
case of conventional securities (with a coupon), 
too, portions of the interest can be paid as dif -
ferences between the issue price and par value. 
If a newly issued instrument’s coupon is higher 
than the market rate, the issue price exceeds 
the par value, producing a premium. The 
greater the difference between the coupon 
and market rate, and the longer the interest 
rate lock- in period of the security, the higher 
the premium becomes.3
The Federal Government generally aims to issue 
a relatively high volume of its individual series 
of securities. This increases the liquidity of the 
instruments and thus reduces the liquidity-  
related interest surcharge as part of the total fi -
nancing costs. In order to reach the target vol -
umes, the individual series are normally issued 
(brought onto the market) in multiple tranches. 
In other words, the initial issue of a series is 
subsequently topped up by sales of additional 
taps.4 While the coupon for the initial issue is 
generally geared to the prevailing capital mar -
ket rate, it can deviate more strongly from this 
in subsequent taps. If the capital market rate 
has fallen in the meantime, the issue price that the Federal Government charges when selling 
securities rises.
A long interest rate lock- in period can easily re -
sult in a sizeable premium. In 2014, for ex -
ample, a 30- year Federal bond (Bund) was 
launched with a coupon of 2.5%, in line with 
market conditions. At the time of the last tap in 
the summer of 2019, its market yield was just 
¼%. This resulted in an extremely large pre -
mium of 60% of par value.
There have been considerable premia in recent 
years. Given the above- described issue strategy 
pursued by the Federal Government, this is be -
cause yields on Federal securities have declined 
sharply overall since the financial and economic 
crisis of 2008-09. For some time now, negative 
yields have even been recorded – extending 
into the 30- year maturity band at the lowest 
point. When interest rates are negative, signifi -
cant premia occur right from initial issuance, 
because coupons do not have a negative inter -
est rate. This has also affected the most import -
ant instrument, the ten- year Bund, with one 
series even generating a premium of just over 
5% of par value. In addition, given the favour -
able conditions, the Federal Government has is -
sued long- dated securities on a particularly 
large scale. The premia on these were espe -
cially high. On balance, the total premia re -
ceived by the Federal Government have risen 
strongly in the past few years. In 2020, they 
doubled to nearly €12 billion on the back of 
very extensive issuance related to the COVID-  19 
crisis.Federal secur -

1 The coupon securitises the claim to payment of interest 
and states the nominal interest rate of a security. This devi -
ates from the constantly changing general market rate. The 
market rate (also known as the effective interest rate or 
yield) takes into account the nominal interest rate as well 
as the difference between the market price and redemp -

Advantages of accrual 
 accounting for premia 
in the Federal budget5
In the Federal budget, coupon payments are 
recognised in the year they fall due, which 
means that they are spread evenly over the 
term of the securities.6 For premia, on the other 
hand, the current practice is to record them in 
full as negative interest expenditure (affecting 
the budget balance) in the year the securities 
are sold. This means that they reduce interest 
expenditure only in the year of sale. From an 
economic perspective, however, the time at 
which interest burdens are recorded should not 
depend on whether they take the form of cou -
pons or premia. It was on the basis of this guid -
ing principle that the Federal Government set 
up a special fund as provision for additional 
payments when redeeming inflation-  linked 
debt instruments. Each year, the Federal budget 
transfers the additional accrued obligations for 
inflation adjustment to this special fund. Hence, 
this type of interest burden is recorded on an 
accruals basis. The following sections will ini -
tially outline how premia, too, can be recorded 
on an accruals basis in the Federal budget in 
future  – similarly to what the basic rules of the 
national accounts intend.
Technically speaking, the premium would be 
recorded as borrowing at the time the security 
is sold. Thus, the borrowing would consist of 
the par value plus the premium (to be amort -
ised over time). Compared with the current 
situation, then, higher borrowing (and equally 
no negative impact on interest expenditure) 
would initially be reported. Part of the future 
coupon payments would then no longer con -
stitute interest expenditure, but rather repay -
ments of this additional borrowing (the amount 
above the market rate at the time the security 
is sold).7 This would mean that interest pay -
ments are recorded evenly year by year, both in 
the budget and for the debt brake.8
There would be significant advantages to tak -
ing this more economically appropriate ap -proach to recording premia (and discounts) in 
the Federal budget. First, it would be more in 
keeping with the objective of the debt brake. 
The rule is intended to limit borrowing and 
hence implicit legacy burdens on future 
budgets. If premia are deducted from interest 
expenditure in the year of issue, as has so far 
been the case, the objective of the debt brake 
is in effect undermined: the premia provide re -
lief in the short term, whereas future budgets 
are saddled with greater burdens from higher 
interest expenditure than implied by the market 
rate when the security was issued. What this 
essentially does is ease the pressure on the 
debt brake in the short term, without the sub -Record interest

6 The first coupon sometimes covers a somewhat longer 
period, since interest can begin accruing more than one 
year before the coupon date. If the instruments are sold 
after interest begins accruing or after a coupon date, ac -
crued interest has to be paid upon acquisition. This is re -
paid by the Federal Government on the next coupon date.
7 A smaller portion of the deviation between the coupon 
and market rate obviously reflects interest on the premium 
in line with market conditions.
8 Compared with the current accounting practice, premia 
recorded as borrowing are offset by additional interest ex -
penditure. The immediate relief that premia have previously 
provided for the debt brake is thus eliminated. It is spread 
over the entire term: to do so, the repayment component 
(for additional borrowing, in the amount of the premium) 
is deducted from the coupon payments. As a result, this 
does not represent a burden on the budget under the debt 
brake. Thus, the yield required by the capital market at the 
time of issue is accounted for throughout, instead of re -
cording the full relief provided by premia at the time of 
issue.Deutsche Bundesbank

sequent burdens that this brings with it being 
disclosed. Ultimately, this could even create a 
political incentive to issue securities with large 
coupons in order to use the premia on these as 
a way of building up extra budgetary scope.9 In 
the case of premia, if the switch were made to 
accrual accounting, this scope would be smaller 
than before in the year of issue and greater in 
subsequent years. By reporting interest on an 
accruals basis, it would then be possible, not 
least, to see the basic position of the Federal 
budget more transparently. It would not be ob -
scured by any large premia.
Second, interest expenditure would be less 
volatile and could be planned fairly reliably. Be -
tween 2010 and 2020, premia fluctuated sig -
nificantly from one year to the next, ranging 
from a marginal discount in 2011 to premia of 
almost €12 billion in 2020. The premia received 
thus reduced reported interest expenditure by 
just under two- thirds last year (see the above 
chart). Overall, outturns often deviated consid -
erably from budget estimates – even though 
some of these had even been updated in sup -
plementary budgets. At their peak, the devi -
ations exceeded 1½% of total expenditure in 
the Federal budget, making them quite signifi -
cant indeed. If premia included in the budget 
plans do not materialise, this can even result in 
the debt brake limits being breached. In the 2021 supplementary budget, one of the factors 
to trigger the increased borrowing requirement 
was lower premia. The relief provided by pre -
mia is set to be €3½ billion lower, because cap -
ital market rates are now higher. From this per -
spective, too, it is therefore advisable to record 
interest burdens in the Federal budget on an 
accruals basis and thus eliminate the volatility 
of premia.
Third, the debt brake is designed to ensure 
compliance with the European fiscal rules. The 
standardised national accounts are applicable 
to them. The rules governing national accounts 
essentially follow the economic perspective 
and stipulate that premia occurring when issu -
ing securities be recorded over the life of the 
security as providing relief.
If the budget accounts are already closed, the 
accounting method cannot be changed retro -
actively. However, to depict the economic rela -
tionship described here for past years as well, 
the Federal Government’s existing debt brake 
control account can be considered: it records 
positive and negative deviations of budget out -
turns from the standard limits.10 In the years 
prior to the coronavirus crisis, the high premia, 
which were not being recorded on an accruals 
basis, increased the credit balances on this ac -
count. If the switch in accounting practice were 
made, as described here, those earlier premia 
would be allocated to future budgets on an ac -
cruals basis with an alleviating effect (reducing 
interest expenditure). In turn, the balance on 
the control account would need to be reduced Current account -

9 In its 2020 remarks, the Federal Court of Auditors points 
out that the impression of opportunity for misuse could 
arise (p. 21). The reasons why premia were so much higher 
in the decade following the introduction of the debt brake 
than in the decade before cannot be determined with cer -
tainty. Ultimately, however, declining and negative interest 
rates are likely to have been a crucial factor in this. The cre -
ation of additional budgetary scope, on the other hand, 
does not appear to have played a decisive role over this 
period.
10 Where these deviations resulted in surpluses in the core 
budget, they were transferred to the reserves held separ -
ately from the control account. Due to the surpluses of 
2015 to 2019, these reserves currently amount to €48 bil -
lion.Deutsche Bundesbank

by the associated premia (not recorded on an 
accruals basis originally). This would see it 
shrink from €52 billion now to a little over €30 
billion.11 If the switch were made, interest ex -
penditure would, on the one hand, be roughly 
€3 billion lower in the current year, given that 
the past premia would now be allocated such 
that they reduce interest. On the other hand, 
this year’s premia would largely be allocated to 
subsequent years. This would make interest ex -
penditure for 2021 around €4 billion higher 
than the budget estimate. On balance, the 
switch would create a burden of roughly €1 bil -
lion in the current budget plan.12
In the event that there is no change to the 
budget accounting method, it would at least 
be advisable to include a transparent auxiliary 
calculation in the budget plan and budget ac -
count.13 This should depict the effects premia 
would have if the relief were recorded over the 
entire term on an accruals basis. In doing so, 
premia from previous years should be pre -
sented as well as those from the relevant 
budget. Overall, the auxiliary calculation should 
represent the structural burden of interest ex -
penditure on the budget in a way that is easily 
understood.14
All things considered, there is much to be said 
for switching the accounting method for inter -
est expenditure, particularly in the Federal 
budget. The current accounting approach en -tails quite a number of problems. Recording 
interest expenditure on an accruals basis would 
be more appropriate from an economic per -
spective; it would make it easier to assess the 
actual budgetary situation, and it should be 
possible to implement the reform without any 
major difficulties. The interest burden on 
budgets would be stabilised, while budget out -
turns could be better planned and would be -
come less erratic. The switch would also be 
more in keeping with the intention of the debt 
brake, doing away with one possibility of cir -
cumventing it. Lastly, changing the way in 
which premia are recorded would also better 
ensure compliance with the European rules.

Local government finances: how cash 
advances can be limited and budget 
 imbalances avoided
Prior to the coronavirus crisis, local government finances were in good shape overall. Local gov -
ernment budgets recorded large surpluses, albeit with significant differences from municipality to 
municipality. Sizeable cash advances continued to persist in some federal states. Technically 
speaking, cash advances are only intended to bridge intra- year, short- term liquidity shortfalls and 
are supposed to be paid off by no later than the fiscal year- end. Despite this, they sometimes also 
span multiple years (i.e. periods extending beyond the fiscal year- end) to make up for budget 
shortfalls. Multi- year cash advances are thus indicative of local government budget imbalances 
that have not been resolved. However, it was possible in the pre- crisis years to reduce these 
advances by a total of one- quarter from their peak levels, in no small part thanks to state- run 
debt relief programmes. Now, as a result of the coronavirus crisis, there is a danger that local 
governments will increasingly turn to multi- year cash advances again to plug their budget gaps. 
While central government and state governments have largely shielded them from the financial 
impact of the crisis over the past year, revenue prospects are still lagging behind their pre- crisis 
levels over the medium term.
Federal states bear much of the responsibility for keeping their municipalities’ finances in order. 
For one thing, they have to ensure the provision of adequate funding. For another, they are 
responsible for budgetary surveillance and have extensive powers of intervention.
There appear to be three big starting points for securing stable local government finances. First, 
a fundamental reform of local government financing to stabilise the currently volatile local gov -
ernment revenue would be a welcome development.
Second, federal states need to ensure that their municipalities’ persistently high levels of cash 
advances are reduced. The spotlight here is on North Rhine-  Westphalia and Rhineland- Palatinate, 
but also Saarland. Debt relief programmes run by federal states, such as the one in Hesse, appear 
to be sensible approaches to handing financial flexibility back to the local government level in the 
future. Programmes of this kind need to be accompanied by rules which, going forward, safe -
guard sound finances and enable location conditions to be of adequate quality.
Third, it is important to prevent structural budget imbalances from materialising in the future. This 
is conditional on federal states being consistent in their surveillance and addressing unwelcome 
developments early on. One stipulation could be that municipalities are only permitted to obtain 
cash advances that would not be repaid by the end of the fiscal year from their home state. The 
federal state would thus also formally assume liability, underscoring its shared responsibility. 
Local government financial problems would then be reflected in state government budgets and 
transparently disclosed to the public in the budgetary accounts. If the necessary borrowing were 
to also count towards federal states’ debt brakes, this would provide them with an added incen -
tive to prevent local government budget imbalances from emerging.Deutsche Bundesbank

Local government budget 
rules and cash advances
Municipalities can take on debt to fund invest -
ment. However, they are subject to relatively 
strict budget rules in the process. For example, 
the municipality is required to demonstrate 
that, looking ahead, it will be able to repay the 
debt from its current revenue. The federal 
states set out detailed budget rules to be fol -
lowed by their municipalities, monitor compli -
ance with these rules and also possess exten -
sive powers of intervention.1 Where necessary, 
they can demand that individual municipalities 
make adjustments before a budget is approved. 
Additionally, they have to ensure the provision 
of adequate funding. In this respect, they bear 
much of the responsibility for keeping their 
municipalities’ finances in order. Regardless, 
some federal states have allowed local govern -
ment budgets to slip, resulting in imbalances 
and even excess balance sheet debt.
At the central and state government levels, 
larger deficits are a sign of budget strains. This 
is less straightforward at the local government 
level, where deficits resulting from debt-  
financed investment can actually be a sign of fi -
nancial strength. By contrast, large volumes of 
cash advances are a reliable indicator of weak -
ness, as they are only actually intended to bridge intra- year liquidity shortfalls. Multi- year 
cash advances are those that could not be re -
paid within one fiscal year, though.2 They were 
taken out not to fund investment but rather to 
plug budget gaps. Large or growing volumes of 
multi- year cash advances are thus a sign of 
structural financial problems that have not yet 
been resolved. Thus, the likelihood of a munici -
pality no longer being able to solve these prob -
lems on its own grows. Such instances of pro -
tracted financial problems and a potential in -
ability to pay back debt are frequently followed 
by a lengthy consolidation period, often going 
hand in hand with low local government invest -
ment, making the location less attractive.3 In 
order to avert the unwelcome adverse effects of 
unsound finances, structural funding gaps have 
to be tackled swiftly and decisively. This is where 
the home state has a pivotal role to play.
Up to the early 1990s, multi-  year cash ad -
vances were not common at the local govern -
ment level. They then grew over many years, 
reaching a peak of around €51 billion at the 
end of 2015 (see the adjacent chart).4 They 
thus made up one- third of debt attributable to 
local government core budgets and off- budget 
entities. In the subsequent period up to the 
end of 2020, cash advances decreased to 
around €37 billion (1.1% of gross domestic 
product (GDP)), or one- quarter of aggregate 
local government debt. They remain a large 
item in many local government budgets, how -
ever.Federal states

2 In this article, “intra- year” and “multi- year” do not refer 
to a cash advance’s term. Instead, they describe whether a 
cash advance is paid off in the same fiscal year (intra- year 
cash advance) or whether it is still outstanding at the end 
of the fiscal year (multi- year cash advance). It is possible for 
a multi- year cash advance to be due in less than one year. 
The remainder of this article focuses on municipalities’ 
multi- year cash advances.

The average volume of local government cash 
advances varies widely across the federal states. 
Across all non- city states, it stood at around 
€480 per capita at the end of 2020, ranging 
from less than €20 in Thuringia to €1,610 in 
Rhineland- Palatinate. Very high per capita cash 
advance levels of over €1,000 were also re -
corded for Saarland (€1,410) and North Rhine- 
Westphalia (€1,180).
State- run debt relief 
 programmes as a possible 
solution for high volumes 
of cash advances
The scaling- back of multi- year cash advances 
went hand in hand with fiscal surpluses, which 
were partly attributable to expanded central 
government aid. This primarily took the form of 
assuming a larger share of the costs of social 
benefits and, for example, providing lump- sum 
funding to cover expenditure related to refu -
gees. On top of this, individual federal states 
launched debt relief programmes. The first of 
these were set up over a decade ago already, 
with varying designs and degrees of success.
State- run debt relief programmes make sense 
where municipalities’ own concerted efforts 
are no longer enough to make a significant 
dent in their large volumes of cash advances. In 
terms of design, it is crucial to ensure that un -
desirable incentives to take on further debt are 
limited. Various parameters come into play 
here. The federal state has to determine the ex -
tent to which it will take on accumulated debt 
from cash advances or participate in servicing 
this debt. It is also necessary to define the 
period of time over which the affected munici -
palities will contribute to financing. Clear con -
ditions can support consolidation require -
ments. Examples of such conditions include 
specifications for non- personal tax multipliers, 
although requirements relating to personnel 
management would also be conceivable. Loca -
tional disadvantages can be related to budget 
problems. With that in mind, debt relief pro -grammes need to be consistently integrated 
into the federal state’s general regional policy, 
e.g. by also using available funding to invest in 
infrastructure within this framework.
In 2018, Hesse opted to take a comprehensive 
approach –  establishing the “Hessenkasse” 
fund  – by making state government funds 
available to service debt.5 Participating munici -
palities remain involved, however, by paying off 
half of their cash advances up to an upper 
limit. Repayments take the form of a fixed an -
nual amount and can be stretched over a 
period of up to 30 years. At the same time, … and concen -

5 Specifically, subject to approval by the municipality, cash 
advances were transferred to the state- owned WIBank (€5 
billion). This debt was local government debt not covered 
on the balance sheet by financial assets. The federal state 
of Hesse provides state government funds for interest and 
principal payments via the off- budget “Hessenkasse” fund. 
Through this set-up, the transferred cash advances no 
longer count as explicit government debt included in the 
government finance statistics. However, they still count to -
wards the general government Maastricht debt as they are 
recorded at the state government level.Deutsche Bundesbank

Hesse tightened its budget law for all munici -
palities to prevent a sustained increase in cash 
advances in the future. Municipalities not sup -
ported by the fund were eligible to receive add -
itional investment grants. All in all, an approach 
of this kind appears sensible. The programme 
combines debt relief by the federal state with 
mandatory participation by the affected muni -
cipalities and stricter budgetary oversight.6 This 
counteracts the undesirable incentive effect of 
debt relief programmes that cash advances 
might appear to present less of a burden to 
municipalities in the future.
There is a less compelling case, however, for cen -
tral government to assume the debt from local 
government cash advances.7 It is the federal 
states that are ultimately responsible for the ac -
cumulation of cash advances. In the past, even 
relatively financially weak federal states were 
able to avoid such build- ups.8 Central govern -
ment is badly placed to counteract the distorted 
incentives associated with assuming this debt, 
and prospective central government aid might 
well be holding back federal states with particu -
larly high levels of cash advances from coming 
up with their own comprehensive solutions.
Approaches to stabilising 
local government finances 
and preventing a return 
to rising cash advances
If new imbalances are to be prevented and mu -
nicipalities enabled to perform their tasks with -
out disruption, a solution focusing on legacy 
debt alone is not enough. The pressure on local 
government budgets has been eased signifi -
cantly in structural terms through various forms 
of central government aid. For example, central 
government’s share in the costs of accommo -
dation for those receiving unemployment 
benefit II was raised again in 2020, and signifi -
cantly so. In the same year, the increased share 
of local business tax revenue that western Ger -
man municipalities were required to pay to the 
federal states ceased to apply. Despite all this, local government financing remains highly 
volatile, which could be remedied by means of 
a fundamental reform.9 Should it not be pos -
sible to deliver such a reform, the cyclical fluc -
tuations in local government finances could be 
smoothed out at the state government level. In 
periods of economic weakness, the federal 
states would support their municipalities in ac -
cordance with the rules. During upswings, the 
state government budgets would then with -
hold the corresponding amount of additional 
revenue. Since federal states’ debt brakes are 
limited to structural new borrowing, they 
would be compatible with such symmetrical 
cyclical strains on, and relief for, state govern -
ment budgets.
In order to support sound local government fi -
nances, federal states need to demonstrate that 
their municipalities receive financing commen -
surate with the tasks of the latter through their 
local government financial equalisation schemes. 
To this end, it would be necessary to determine 
as transparently as possible, assuming a cost-  
effective approach, the financing requirements 
associated with mandatory municipal services. 
This is already compulsory in some federal states.No compelling

6 Saarland took a similar approach: starting in 2020, the 
state took on repayment of €1 billion, or around half of its 
municipalities’ cash advances, through its “Saarlandpakt” 
fund. The off- budget fund makes interest and principal 
payments for the cash advances it has assumed and is fi -
nanced from the state’s core budget. Municipalities are 
required  to pay off their remaining cash advances out of 
surpluses by the end of 2064.
7 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).
8 In 2019, the Federal Government members of the Com -
mission on Equivalent Living Conditions proposed that cen -
tral government assume the debt from local government 
cash advances on a one-  off basis. However, the proposal 
was not approved by those federal states with municipal -
ities that already had scarcely any cash advance debt due 
to strict state- level budgetary oversight.
9 Starting points for such a reform were presented in 
greater detail in Deutsche Bundesbank (2020). For ex -
ample, the weight of the highly volatile local business tax in 
the total tax revenue received at the local government level 
could be reduced. In return, the weight of more stable 
sources of revenue, such as municipalities’ share of wage 
tax revenue, could be raised. This would change the distri -
bution of wage tax nationally, but not increase the tax it -
self. Another possible option is to give municipalities the 
power to set their own local multipliers on the local gov -
ernment share of general income tax. In addition, local 
government financial equalisation could be stabilised by 
not passing temporary tax revenue shortfalls at the state 
government level through to the local government level.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

Additionally, local government budget rules 
could also be applied more rigorously. This 
could also involve the federal state making spe -
cific interventions in local government budgets 
if rules are violated. Effective budgetary over -
sight of this nature is ultimately also an import -
ant factor in maintaining room for manoeuvre 
in the future.
Another option would be to reform local govern -
ment budget rules to make them more effective. 
One stipulation could be that municipalities are 
only permitted to obtain cash advances that 
would not be repaid by the end of the fiscal year 
from their home state. Anchoring borrowing op -
tions in this way would underscore the latter’s 
shared responsibility. Up to now, it has been for 
the most part assumed on the markets that, in 
the event of default, the federal states are liable 
for loans taken out by their municipalities. For 
this reason, multi- year cash advances are made 
available at comparatively favourable conditions, 
even when municipalities find themselves in fi -
nancial difficulties. Given the silent nature of this 
financing, the problem of cash advances also 
threatens to stay off the political radar. The pro -
posed change would result in the federal states 
being directly and solely affected by difficulties in 
repaying cash advances, which would provide 
clarity at the state and local government levels as 
well as for the capital market regarding account -
ability. Municipalities’ planned multi- year cash 
advances would then be disclosed annually in 
state government budgets and outturns.10 Finan -
cial problems at the local government level 
would thus be presented transparently, on an an -
nual basis at fiscal year- end close and, at the lat -
est, in the budgetary accounts.11
Federal states’ debt brakes place severe restric -
tions on their ability to borrow. As a result, 
there is an incentive for the federal states to 
keep local government financial equalisation 
tight in order to relieve the pressure on their 
own budgets. This would also be the case if 
– as outlined above – municipalities were only 
permitted to obtain multi-  year cash advances 
from their home state. As long as it is formally assumed when lending these funds that the 
advances are not ultimately transfers, as finan -
cial transactions they do not usually count to -
wards the state’s debt brake. However, since 
the use of cash advances over multiple years in -
dicates that the recipient municipality is cur -
rently unable to make regular repayments, this 
classification does not seem appropriate. It 
would therefore make sense to count multi-  
year local government cash advances towards 
federal states’ borrowing under their debt 
brakes. Insofar as local government underfund -
ing is reflected in growing multi- year cash ad -
vances, responsibility for this development 
would then rest with the federal state.12 The 
federal states’ budgetary oversight keeps them 
protected from being put under pressure by 
their municipalities through excessive expend -
iture.
Irrespective of such a reform, it would make 
sense to flag state- specific strains in local gov -
ernment finances in a transparent manner. This 
would raise awareness of the problem. For ex -
ample, in its budget analysis for individual fed -
eral states, the Stability Council could highlight 
local government cash advances in a dedicated 
population- based indicator.13 If a certain 
threshold is exceeded in the previous year, this 
would sound an alarm in budgetary surveil -
lance. The federal state concerned could then 
be prompted to adopt specific measures aimed 
at stabilising local finances.14Effective local

10 As a rule, it is unlikely when a federal state is drawing 
up its budget plan that more than a handful of budgets for 
the state’s numerous municipalities will have already been 
approved. However, the state- level financial supervisors 
overseeing local government finances could provide plaus -
ible estimates here. If, as time went on, greater local gov -
ernment needs led to additional financing requirements, a 
supplementary budget would have to be adopted.
11 If the municipalities receive cash advances at standard -
ised terms and the federal states themselves raise capital in 
the capital market, transaction and interest costs for muni -
cipalities could also fall.

13 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018).
14 Possible starting points for such measures would then, 
in turn, be multipliers for non- personal taxes, local govern -
ment expenditure in relation to appropriate benchmarks as 
well as the allocation and distribution of funds in the local 
government financial equalisation scheme.Deutsche Bundesbank

Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity

circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

values for Germany deviated from the final data by a maximum of 0.1% for employees
subject to social contributions, by a maximum of 0.7% for persons solely in jobs
exempt from social contributions, and by a maximum of 55.3% for cyclically induced
short-time work.  10 Initial preliminary estimate by the Federal Statistical Office.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure used by the ECB to compute the
effective exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in
competitiveness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services.
For more detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of
the Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 ECB
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
group EER-19 and additionally Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India,
