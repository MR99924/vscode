Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy entered the third quar -
ter of 2012 quite positively. Industrial output 
showed a marked increase in July and con -
struction activity expanded considerably. In 
conjunction with the mostly satisfactory assess-
ment of the current situation in trade and in -
dustry, this suggests that the German economy 
is continuing its modest upward trend for the 
time being. However, the economic outlook re-
mains subject to major uncertainty. Although in July new industrial orders matched the average level of the first half of the year, in August en-
terprises scaled back their business expect -
ations again distinctly from an already de -
pressed level. Signs of weakening macroeco -
nomic momentum are also becoming evident 
on the labour market. German economic activ-
ity is being supported by households’ con -
tinued high consumption propensity and hous-ing construction. There are also indications that 
the slide in spending on new machinery and 
equipment may have halted.
Industry
Industry increased its output substantially in July by a seasonally adjusted 1¾% on the month. The level of output likewise rose by 
1¾% compared with the average of the second 
quarter. However, part of the increase can be 
explained by the constellation of public holi -
days. In particular, manufacturers of capital 
goods recorded strong growth. The production 
of intermediate goods increased only slightly, while the manufacture of consumer goods, which is subject to less cyclical fluctuation, 
barely changed.
Industrial new orders in Germany rose slightly 
in July, recording a seasonally adjusted increase of ½% on the month. They did not quite attain the average level of the second quarter but did match the first-quarter level. The small increase 
in orders from non-euro-area countries failed 
to offset the declining demand from Germany 
and other euro-area states. Whilst orders of 
capital and consumer goods equalled the re -
spective prior-quarter levels, producers of inter -
mediate goods saw demand dip by 1¼%, 
mainly due to a downturn in domestic orders.
In July, turnover in industry went up by a sea -
sonally adjusted 1½% on the month. This was 
1% higher than the average level between April 
and June. Whereas sales of intermediate and 
consumer goods dropped a little, capital goods 
turnover expanded strongly. Sales of industrial 
products grew at an even pace in Germany and 
on foreign markets, where higher turnover 
with non-euro-area customers was counterbal-anced by a decrease in euro-area business. The value of both exported and imported goods in-
creased by a seasonally adjusted ¾% com -
pared with the second-quarter average.
Construction
Construction activity in July expanded by a sea-sonally adjusted 1¾% vis-à-vis June. It likewise 
recorded a 1¾% increase compared with the 
average level in the second quarter. Civil engin-eering work expanded more than building pro-jects. Construction orders in June – more  recent 
data are unavailable at present – were almost 
unchanged on May. The steep rise in building 
construction, mainly of housing, almost offset 
the substantial decline in civil engineering.

Germany was only about half as large as the 
average in the first half of the year. The year-
on-year figure showed an increase of 469,000, 
or 1.1%. In the case of employment subject to 
social security contributions, seasonally ad -
justed growth in June was also no longer as robust according to an initial estimate, al
-
though the year-on-year increase nonetheless 
amounted to 546,000, or 1.9%. According to 
the Ifo Employment Barometer, firms’ willing -
ness to recruit new staff declined considerably in August for the second month running. How-
ever, the Federal Employment Agency’s BA-X 
job index remained fairly stable.
In August, the official unemployment figure went up slightly after seasonal adjustment to 2.90 million. Nevertheless, the unemploy
-
ment rate (using the Federal Employment Agency’s definition) remained at 6.8%, as it 
has for just over half a year. By contrast, total 
underemployment recorded by the Federal Em-ployment Agency declined slightly in seasonally adjusted terms. In the reporting month, it was 201,000 lower than one year previously, whilst 
there was a fall of 40,000 in registered un -
employment. The seasonally adjusted number 
of jobless persons claiming insurance benefits 
rose by 12,000 in August and was also higher than 12 months earlier. The number of longer-term job seekers receiving the basic welfare al-
lowance decreased by almost 82,000 com -
pared with August 2011.
Prices
The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil rose steeply in August on the back of heightened 
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and, at 
US$112, was 9½% above the July average. As 
this report went to press, the price dipped to US$109 following Saudi Arabia’s announce
-
ment that it will increase production. Crude oil 
futures were still being quoted at marked dis -
counts (US$3 for deliveries six months ahead 
and US$6¼ 12 months ahead).Slowly rising

Import prices rose overall in July compared with 
June by a seasonally adjusted 0.8% owing to 
higher energy prices and lagged exchange rate 
effects. Excluding energy, the month-on-month 
increase was 0.3%. Domestic producer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in 
total, with energy prices rising by 1.5%; other 
industrial goods prices remained unchanged. Despite the major month-on-month increase, 
year-on-year import inflation slowed to 1.2%, 
whereas the annual rate of increase in produ -
cer prices accelerated to 1.6%.
Consumer prices climbed by a substantial 0.4% 
in seasonally adjusted terms in August com -
pared with July. In particular, fuels rose sharply 
as a result of higher crude oil prices. In add -
ition, food prices increased and industrial 
goods (excluding energy) were slightly more 
expensive. By contrast, service costs remained 
largely stable. The annual rate of consumer in-
flation went up from 1.7% to 2.1% according 
to the national CPI and from 1.9% to 2.2% as measured by the HICP .
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance institutions and 
the health insurance fund recorded a combined 
surplus of just over €1½ billion in the second 
quarter of 2012, compared with just under €2 
billion one year previously. At just over €1 bil -
lion, the health insurance institutions‘ surplus 
was somewhat higher in year-on-year terms 
(2011 Q2: just under €1 billion), while the sur -
plus of the health insurance fund almost 
halved, from just below €1 billion to just over 
€½ billion. The statutory health insurance sys -
tem as a whole recorded somewhat weaker 
growth in revenue (not quite 2½%) than in ex-penditure (slightly more than 2½%).
At just over 3%, the health insurance institu -
tions‘ revenue (predominantly transfers from the health insurance fund) grew around ½ per -
centage point faster than their expenditure. 
Following its acceleration in the first quarter of 
2012, growth in spending thus slowed mark -
edly. This is also the case for the pharmaceut -
ical sector, even though the temporarily higher 
manufacturer discounts now have hardly any dampening effect. The stricter validation of 
additional therapeutic benefits of new medica-
tions may have helped to hold down pharma-
ceutical expenditure. By contrast, spending on 
hospital treatment and sickness benefit con -
tinued to expand robustly. However, at just 
over 3%, the overall rise in spending in the first 
half of 2012 was significantly lower than the 
figure projected by the group of statutory health insurance estimators in the autumn of 2011 (+ 4½%), which determines the level of 
transfers from the health insurance fund. This is the main reason why the health insurance insti-
tutions posted an unexpectedly favourable fi -
nancial result.
At 3½%, the health insurance fund‘s expend -
iture (primarily transfers to the health insurance 
institutions) once again grew at a significantly 
stronger pace than its revenue (2½%). The on-going favourable employment and wage devel-
opments meant that contribution receipts (+3½%) kept up with the pace of spending. However, transfers from the central govern
-
ment budget are much lower in 2012 (€14.0 billion for 2012 as a whole, compared with 
€15.3 billion in 2011).
At just over €2½ billion, the health insurance institutions‘ surplus for the first half of 2012 was higher than the figure posted one year 
previously (just under €2½ billion). By contrast, 
there was a marked deterioration in the fi -
nances of the health insurance fund (-€½ bil -Higher import

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the

November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of

quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and public debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

lion compared with +€½ billion for the first half 
of 2011). The health insurance institutions in 
particular look likely to record a clear surplus 
for 2012 as a whole, albeit lower than the fig-
ure recorded one year earlier. This is because 
their expenditure is growing at a weaker-than-
expected pace, whereas their revenue had 
been fixed in advance. Despite recording a def-
icit to date, the health insurance fund will 
probably post a surplus for the year as a whole. 
The ongoing transfers to the health insurance 
institutions will be offset by seasonal contribu-tion receipts, which are particularly high during 
the final months of the year, mainly due to 
Christmas bonuses.
In 2013, central government will transfer €2 bil-
lion less to the health insurance fund on a 
one-off basis. There will therefore be less 
money available to transfer to the health insur -
ance institutions. Given the health insurance 
institutions‘ large reserves of almost €13 billion as at mid-2012, even if their expenditure is not completely covered by transfers from the health insurance fund, the institutions are likely to be 
able to cope with this without needing to in -
crease current contributions or demand add -
itional contributions on a sizeable scale. How -
ever, the currently particularly favourable finan-
cial situation cannot persist indefinitely. Both past experience and demographic changes 
suggest that in the longer term healthcare ex-
penditure will increase more sharply than in -
come subject to compulsory insurance contri -
butions, thus leading to mounting pressure to 
put up the general contribution rate or raise additional contributions. This process will be accelerated to the extent that the political 
temptation to plunder the high reserves accu -
mulated by the service providers is not resisted.
Public long-term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme re-
corded a marginal surplus in the second quar -
ter of 2012, which was somewhat smaller than 
the figure recorded one year previously. The 
continued robust growth in total revenue (+3½%) was once again primarily due to the rise of 4½% in employees‘ contributions. By contrast, pensioners‘ contributions increased 
by only 1% owing to the low mid-2011 pension 
increase. Contributions for recipients of un -
employment benefits were down by only 1% on the year. This indicates that the fall in un
-
employment is gradually tapering off. However, 
at almost 5%, expenditure rose at a consider -
ably stronger pace than revenue. The increase 
in benefit rates by an average of just under 2% at the start of 2012 played a role in this.
The slight financial deterioration in the first half 
of the year is likely to continue until the end of 2012. Nevertheless, a surplus could once again be posted for the year as a whole. In the longer 
run, the public long-term care insurance scheme is likely to record a deficit owing to demographic developments. The benefit in

Long-Term Care (Pflege-Neuausrichtungsge-  
setz),  particularly those for persons suffering 
from dementia, will accelerate and amplify the 
foreseeable structural deficits in this area. Al -
though the increase in the contribution rate 
from 1.95% to 2.05% on 1 January 2013 (plus 
0.25% in each case for the childless) will gener -
ate additional revenue of around €1 billion, this 
will only cover additional expenditure on a 
temporary basis. Moreover, the subsidising of 
private long-term care provision, which has 
also been approved, will produce fiscal bur -
dens. This measure is likely to entail in particu-lar a rechanneling of the private savings of the 
wealthy, as the possibility of including the re -
sulting payments in the calculation of the basic allowance makes private provision less attract-ive for lower and medium income groups.
Securities markets
Bond market
In July, gross issuance in the German bond 
market totalled €141.8 billion, which was sig -
nificantly higher than in June (€117.0 billion). After deducting redemptions (€132.6 billion), 
which did not increase as much, and after tak-
ing account of changes in issuers’ holdings of 
their own bonds, the volume of domestic se -
curities rose by €15.3 billion on balance. The German market attracted €5.1 billion net of 
foreign debt securities, so that the outstanding volume of debt securities in Germany increased overall by €20.4 billion.
In July, the public sector tapped the bond mar -
ket for €13.0 billion, compared with just €0.9 
billion in June, which traditionally records high 
tax receipts. Net sales, however, were largely 
attributable to the resolution agency, which is 
classified as part of central government. Ex -
cluding this issuance, central government re -
duced its capital market debt in the month 
under review. This included the redemption of 
ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds) in the record 
volume of €25.6 billion. By contrast, central government increased the outstanding volume 
of two-year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze: €4.5 billion), five-year Federal notes (Bobls: 
€4.0 billion) and thirty-year Bunds (€3.9 billion). 
The state governments issued new bonds 
worth €6.2 billion net.
Domestic enterprises issued debt securities to -
talling €3.2 billion on balance in the month under review (after redeeming €5.1 billion in June). In net terms, solely bonds issued by non-financial corporations with maturities of 
more than one year were issued.
Domestic credit institutions’ capital market 
debt remained virtually unchanged in net terms in July (-€0.9 billion after -€4.2 billion in June). Although the outstanding volume of mortgage 
Pfandbriefe and debt securities issued by spe -
cialised credit institutions increased slightly (to-
gether €1.8 billion), this was outweighed by 
higher redemptions of other bank debt secur -Net issuance in

ities and public Pfandbriefe (together €2.7 bil -
lion).
Domestic non-banks were the main buyers of 
German debt securities in July, stepping up 
their purchases by €29.0 billion. Foreign invest-
ors, by contrast, were more restrained (€0.3 bil-lion). Domestic credit institutions reduced their bond holdings by €9.0 billion, primarily by dis-
posing of foreign securities (€7.5 billion). The Deutsche Bundesbank acquired bonds worth €0.1 billion as part of a Eurosystem securities 
purchase programme.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises placed a slightly higher volume of new 
shares in the German equity market (€1.0 bil -
lion) than they had done in June (€0.7 billion). 
The outstanding volume of foreign shares in the German market increased by €5.2 billion over the same period. Domestic investors were 
the main buyers of shares (€4.3 billion). Their 
net purchases of foreign equities were partly 
counterbalanced by net sales of domestic 
stocks across all sectors (-€0.9 billion). By con-
trast, non-residents increased their holdings of German shares (€1.9 billion).
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds attracted a large inflow 
of €15 billion in July compared with €10.1 bil -
lion in June. This was primarily channelled to 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€13.9 billion), including a customised 
fund of funds launched for a single investor, which attracted €9.0 billion worth of assets 
under management in July. Funds open to the 
general public sold shares for €1.1 billion net. 
The outstanding amount of foreign mutual fund units in the German market likewise in
-
creased during the month under review, rising 
by €2.8 billion. On balance, domestic non-banks were almost the sole buyers of mutual 
fund units (€17.3 billion). In contrast, the port-
folios of domestic banks and foreign investors 
remained virtually unchanged.
Balance of payments
The German current account posted a surplus 
– in unadjusted terms – of €12.8 billion in July 
2012, which was €5.7 billion below the level recorded in June. This was attributable to a 
narrower trade surplus and to the fact that in-
visible current transactions, which comprise 
services, income and current transfers, reverted to a deficit.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in July the foreign 
trade surplus went down by €1.1 billion on the 
month to €16.9 billion. After adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar variations, it fell slightly 
by €0.2 billion to €16.1 billion. This was be -

0.9%, was somewhat stronger than the 0.5% 
rise in the value of exports. Compared with the 
second-quarter average, nominal imports and 
exports both rose by 0.9%. Price effects did not 
play a predominant role in either case.
Invisible current transactions posted a deficit of 
€1.2 billion in July, compared with a surplus of €3.2 billion in June. A deterioration in all three sub-accounts contributed to this development. 
The month-on-month decrease of €3.8 billion 
in the services sub-account, resulting in a def -
icit of €3.6 billion, played a decisive role. This 
decline was caused partly by the rise in travel 
expenditure that is typical for this time of year, but also by special factors such as reduced in-come from IT services and research and devel-opment, as well as a fall in receipts from mer -
chanting trade. The surplus in cross-border in -
come narrowed by €0.4 billion to €4.9 billion. The deficit in current transfers rose by €0.2 bil-
lion to reach €2.5 billion in the reporting 
month.
Cross-border portfolio investment saw net cap-
ital exports of €7.9 billion in July, having experi-
enced capital inflows of €7.5 billion in June. 
This shift was mainly due to German investors 
becoming net buyers of foreign securities again 
(€9.9 billion). German investors acquired €5.1 
billion in debt securities issued by non-residents, after selling an equivalent amount of this type 
of paper in June. Their demand was concen -
trated mainly on euro-denominated bonds and notes (€5.7 billion). In addition, German invest-ors increased their portfolio holdings of foreign 
shares (€2.0 billion). Foreign investors pur -
chased German securities amounting to €2.1 
billion net in July. They mainly acquired money market paper (€5.0 billion) and shares (€1.8 bil-lion), but sold bonds and notes (€4.8 billion) in return.

The performance of German credit 
 institutions in 2011
In 2011, the setting was complex with robust domestic activity in the German economy, which 
was in sound shape, accompanied by ongoing major challenges and risks facing the financial 
markets under the impact of a deepened sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Given this environment 
and a virtually unchanged volume of balance sheet business, German banks just about managed to maintain, at around €125 billion, the previous year’s level of operating income.
Interest and commission business – the two major pillars and stability factors in the return pro-
file – accounted for roughly 96% of total operating income in the reporting year. Given historic-
ally low rates of return in the money and capital markets as well as an ongoing reduction in 
risk-bearing assets on the banks’ balance sheets, aggregate net interest received showed a mod-erate 0.8% decline to €91 billion, whereas net commissions received increased slightly by 0.6% to €29 billion.
There were varying developments, too, in the other sources of income for the operating result 
before the valuation of assets. Following a loss in 2010, net other operating income, for example, made a small positive contribution, although this was largely offset by a deterioration in the net profit from the trading portfolio. The key factors in this context were large valuation haircuts in the trading portfolio and declining activity in own-account trading due to the restructuring of the business strategy, especially in the Landesbanken sector. The operating result before the valuation of assets remained largely stable overall.
Net income or net charges from the valuation of assets (valuation result), which had a clearly 
negative impact on the result in the preceding year, showed a positive balance for the first time in the observation period since 1993. This swing is likely to have been due mainly to the conver-
sion of undisclosed reserves into disclosed reserves in preparation for Basel III (“reallocation 
effect”), which was especially prevalent in the case of savings banks and the regional institutions of credit cooperatives.
As in previous years, the “extraordinary account” put a considerable strain on profitability. Given 
higher expenses and declining income, the balance worsened by €4.5 billion to -€17.0 billion. The 
main reason for this was a marked rise of €8 billion to €10.4 billion in net charges in financial 
investment business: according to the published annual reports, this was due chiefly to extraor-dinary write-downs on Greek sovereign bonds.
Overall, there was a marked increase in the profit for the financial year, although this would have 
been somewhat less positive without the “reallocation effect”. While income from the liquidation of undisclosed reserves is recorded in the valuation result, transfers to disclosed reserves do not reduce the profit for the financial year in the performance analysis presented here; instead, they are allocated to the accumulation of reserves as part of the appropriation of profit. On the aggre-gate level, there was a balance sheet loss for the fourth time in succession (€1.1 billion, compared with €0.8 billion in 2010).Deutsche Bundesbank

Complex setting affecting 
performance
The Bundesbank’s statistics of the banks’ profit 
and loss accounts for 2011 reflected very differ -
ent, and sometimes conflicting influencing fac-tors. In their domestic markets, the credit insti-
tutions were able to continue operating in a 
favourable macroeconomic climate marked by 
robust activity. There were also no indications 
that the German business sector’s demand for credit could not be covered adequately on the supply side. Not least, generally very low inter -
est rates in Germany and matching attractive 
financing costs buoyed the external demand 
for funds for private domestic fixed capital for -
mation.
This contrasted with renewed tensions in the 
financial markets owing to the re-emergence of doubts about the long-term debt sustain
-
ability of some EU countries. At the same time, banks were generally endeavouring to adjust or correct their risk profile in lending business and giving high priority to credit quality and liquid-
ity provisioning, even at the cost of forgoing 
profit opportunities and growth in profitability. In the strategic review of their business models, 
the domestic core business areas therefore 
took pride of place. In this connection, a par -
ticular role was also played by European Com-mission requirements for some larger banks as well as transfers of severely distressed assets to resolution agencies, which are assigned to the 
government sector rather than the banking 
sector. Not least, a lot of time and energy was taken up with preparing for the new regulatory 
requirements concerning the more stringent 
capital and liquidity standards of Basel III, which 
are being phased in from 2013.1
The results – described in detail below – of the statistics on the banks’ profit and loss accounts 
are based on the published annual reports of 
all banks (monetary financial institutions) domi-
ciled in Germany in accordance with the ac -
counting rules of the Act Modernising Ac -
counting Law (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsge -setz; BilMoG), which came into force in 2010.2 
Building and loan associations, institutions in liquidation as well as institutions with a trun
-
cated financial year are not covered in the per -
formance analysis presented here. The pub -
lished individual accounts drawn up in accord-ance with the German Commercial Code (Han-
delsgesetzbuch) used as a basis here differ in 
terms of their conception, structure and defin-
itions from the internationally customary IFRS 
accounting standards for publicly traded bank-ing groups,
3 which means that the business re-
sults and certain balance sheet or individual profit/loss items are not (directly) comparable 
for methodological reasons.
Largely stable net interest 
 received
In the reporting year, reported interest received 
showed a sharp rise of €33.9 billion to €296.1 billion, as did interest paid, going up by €34.6 billion to €204.7 billion, although this stood in 
striking contrast to the low level of debit and 
credit interest and the declining volume of 
interest business. The main reason for this dis-
crepancy, according to the published annual 
report of one Landesbank, was that a change 
in reporting practice had been made in the re-
porting year for interest income and expense 
from trading activities, which led to a jump in 
level of just under €30 billion in both interest 
flows. Adjusted for this purely accounting ef -
fect, there was no more than a slight rise. Overall, net interest received showed a mar

matched the average level of the past five 
years.
On the basis of the information collected for 
the banking statistics, there was an obvious de-
cline in German banks’ overall lending business 
(loans and securitised lending) in 2011, which was detrimental to an improvement in profit
-
ability borne by the volume of credit. This was 
due, in particular, to a sharp reduction in loans 
to public authorities, which were reassigned to 
the government sector in the preceding year in the course of establishing two resolution agen-cies (Abwicklungsanstalten). Added to this was 
the fact that the government’s budgetary situ-
ation had eased: given a deficit ratio of 4.3% in 
2010, it had to cover a funding shortfall of only 1% of gross domestic product (GDP). This con-
trasted with marked growth in lending to the 
domestic private sector. Most of this increase 
was due to the private financial sector, with a 
prominent role being played by exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) from repo oper
-
ations. A positive underlying trend could also be seen in loans to the private non-financial sector, however. Loans to households by sav
-
ings banks and cooperative banks were the key 
factor here, with such lending continuing the previous year’s moderate rise. This develop
-
ment was due almost exclusively to loans for house purchase. Their growth became recog
-
nisably stronger, although comparatively low 
margins meant that the inherent potential for 
earning interest was stable but only moderate.
Moreover, the stricter regulatory capital re -
quirements under CRD IV (Basel III),4 which are 
to be observed from 2013, are likely to have 
already affected net interest received in the re-
porting year. For example, German banks tak -
ing part in the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) stated that they had increased their regulatory capital 
ratio not least by reducing their exposure to 
risky loans. Portfolio shifts to loans with lower risk weights or with a zero weighting – such as 
Bunds – do lower the prudential capital re -
quirements, but they also reduce short-term profitability since they generate a smaller de
-fault and risk premium than riskier forms of in-vestment.
Given the prevailing interest rate constellation, 
income from maturity transformation – an im-
portant source of income mainly for savings 
banks and credit cooperatives (for details, see 
the notes on pages 16-17) – is unlikely to have 
provided any additional momentum. Smaller interest rate differentials than in 2009 and 
2010 meant that there was, at least, consider -
ably reduced scope for generating a (term-) 
structural contribution.

funding conditions in the wake of the renewed 
disruptions in the financial markets is unlikely 
to have placed a perceptible strain on the Ger -

The impact of maturity transformation on the earnings 
 situation of German banks
Net interest received is by far the most im-
portant source of earnings for banks in Ger-
many. For theoretical considerations, this item can be broken down into different 
components. Banks take credit risks and are 
compensated for this assumption of risk. They likewise have – varying degrees of – leeway when it comes to shaping terms 
and conditions. One factor in this context is 
that small investors usually have no direct 
access to the capital market, which is why 
they leave their deposits at the bank even 
when deposit rates are lower than the inter-
est on comparable investments in the cap-
ital market. The same applies, conversely, to lending.
1
A further component of net interest re-
ceived stems from maturity transformation, 
which is closely connected with banking 
business. In their traditional business, banks 
typically issue long-term illiquid loans and refi  nance themselves through short-term 
customer deposits. Maturity transformation therefore entails two risks: the risk of hold-
ing barely tradeable loans and the risk 
owing to an asymmetrical interest rate fi  x-
ation period, known as “interest rate risk”. 
The difference between these two risks can 
be illustrated by two examples. A ten-year 
Bund can – under normal circumstances – 
be sold on the capital market at any given 
time without affecting the price; however, 
its interest rate risk is high because the 
nominal interest rate is fi  xed for ten years. 
In contrast to this would be, say, a ten-year 
loan to a small or medium-sized enterprise 
with an interest rate which is regularly ad-
justed to a short-term reference rate (eg 
Euribor).
Interest rate risk ranks foremost among 
risks resulting from maturity transformation. Interest rates generally rise in relation to the 
length of time to maturity (normal term structure), resulting in a positive return on average if loans with long rate fi  xation 
periods are issued and funded by deposits 
with short rate fi  xation periods. However, if 
interest rates rise (across all maturities), 
banks’ interest income barely increases (as 
lending rates increase only in new busi-
ness), whereas deposits are rapidly adjusted 
to the higher interest rate level owing to their shorter rate fi  xation period and be-come more expensive accordingly. More-over, the empirical fi  nding is that interest 
rates at the short end of the yield curve are more volatile than those at the long end. In 
other words, given an increase in interest 
rates, short-term rates will rise more sharply 
than long-term rates. Owing to these two 
factors, a rising interest rate level per se will 
initially lead to a decline in net interest re-
ceived. This effect will be all the stronger, the more a bank performs maturity trans-
formation without hedging the interest rate 
risk by means of appropriate derivative 
transactions via the market.
The banking supervisors regularly monitor 
banks’ interest rate risk;2 such information 
was used as part of an empirical study to 
gauge the importance of earnings from as-suming interest rate risk.
3 For this purpose, 
a calculation was made of the earnings that

would be generated by a passive Bund trad-
ing strategy showing the same interest rate 
risk as that of the studied banks. For the 
observation period from 2005 to 2009, the following main results were derived for the 
1,562 banks involved (see also the table 
above).
– The contribution made by interest rate 
risks to total net interest received amounts to a share of just over 12% across all categories of banks on a 
long-term average.
– This share fl  uctuates strongly over time; 
depending on the steepness of the yield 
curve, up to one-fourth of annual net 
interest income can be attributed to 
earnings from interest rate risk.
– A cross-section analysis of banks shows 
that earnings from assuming interest rate 
risk are an important source of income 
mainly for savings banks and credit co-operatives owing to their specifi  c cus-tomer structure; private commercial banks, however, are less exposed to interest rate risk, and assuming interest rate risk therefore makes a correspond-ingly smaller contribution to their earn-
ings.
– The contribution to earnings made by 
interest rate risk is a volatile income com-
ponent. Changes to the timing of this contribution explain up to one-third of 
the changes in net interest income.Earnings from interest rate risks

balance. While banks in many EU countries 
were faced with massive liquidity shortages 
and outflows of capital, especially in the second 
half of the year, the German banking system 
benefited from the “safe haven effect” against the backdrop of a stable economic situation at 
home and the high level of confidence in the 
debt sustainability of the German government. On the whole, high inflows of deposits meant that German banks tended to be less reliant on 
the bond market as a source of funding. The loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio
5 was 150% at the 
end of 2011 and thus 12 percentage points 
lower than one year earlier.
The share of net interest received in operating 
income (net interest received and net commis-
sions received plus net profit or loss from the 
trading portfolio and net other operating in -
come or charges) declined by 0.3 percentage points to 72.9% and was thus, for the third 
time in succession, roughly at the level of the 
long-term average in the observation period since 1993. The interest margin, ie net interest 
received in relation to the average balance 
sheet total, fell slightly by 0.1 percentage point to 1.0%,
6 which was, however, due to a sharp 
rise of almost 11% in the balance sheet total to 
nearly €9 trillion. This increase was essentially 
caused by the application of the provisions of 
the Act Modernising Accounting Law, one of which requires the reporting of derivative fi
-
nancial instruments in the trading portfolio 
from the financial year 2010. The associated in-
crease in the balance sheet total, especially in 
the case of the big banks, as of the balance sheet date 31  December 2010 had no more than a minor effect on the calculation of the balance sheet total on an annual average for 
2010, but had a marked effect on the calcula-Interest margin

tion for 2011.7 After adjustment for the effect 
of the Act, the figure probably showed hardly 
any change in comparison with the previous 
year, with the interest margin remaining virtu -
ally stable. This view is also supported by the 
banks’ gross interest margin in existing busi -
ness with loans and deposits of the domestic private non-financial sector. Despite growing downward pressure over the course of the year, the difference between the volume-weighted average interest rates for loans and deposits in existing business declined by no more than 0.1 percentage point in annual 
terms.8 This also shows that the net interest re-
ceived of any given period is, to a large extent, 
determined by business transactions in earlier 
financial years, while new business only grad -
ually has an impact on the income statement.
Net interest received presents a mixed picture 
across the various categories of banks in the reporting year. In the case of commercial banks, it increased slightly by €0.1 billion to €32.6 billion. Within this category, big banks’ earnings from this source were €0.5 billion 
lower at €19.1 billion, whereas regional banks, 
given diverse developments across these insti -
tutions, were able to record a slight increase of €0.5 billion to €13.2 billion. In the case of big banks, the share of net interest received in op-erating income was 57.5%; for regional banks, the figure was 63.6%. Savings banks and credit 
cooperatives, for which deposit and lending 
business are traditionally of major importance, 
were again able to report increases, albeit slight ones, to €23.8 billion and €16.3 billion respectively. In the case of savings banks, net interest received accounted for 79.6% of the surplus in operating business. For credit co
-
operatives, the figure was 78.0%. In the Lan -
desbanken category, net interest received –  their most important earnings item with a 94.5% share in operating income (compared 
with 84.4% in 2010) – went up slightly by €0.2 
billion to €10.5 billion. According to the pub-
lished annual reports, one positive factor in the 
case of some Landesbanken was not servicing 
hybrid capital instruments. In the case of re -gional institutions of credit cooperatives, net 
interest received was virtually unchanged at 
€1.2 billion. Despite this, its share in operating 
income went up by 9.9 percentage points 
to 70.4%. For both the Landesbanken and the regional institutions of credit cooperatives, the identifiable increase in this ratio was due to de-
clining operating income mainly as a result of 
marked losses in the net profit or net loss from 
the trading portfolio. Mortgage banks, on the 
other hand, suffered a considerable decline in 
net interest received of €0.9 billion to €2.6 bil-
lion. Even so, its share in operating income 
went up by more than 43 percentage points as 
total operating income in this category of banks was lower than net interest received, 
mainly because of the large negative balance in 
net other operating income or charges. The published figures show that this decline was essentially due to two institutions affected by 
the restructuring requirements imposed in the 
context of EU state aid control procedures. The reasons given for this decline included a smaller loan portfolio and more difficult financial mar -
ket conditions, especially in unsecured whole -
sale funding.
Slight improvement in net 
commissions received
Following a slight recovery in 2010, the persist-
ent trend of declining commission income be -
tween 2007 and 2009 continued in the finan-
cial year 2011. Even so, net commissions re -
ceived showed a slight rise of €0.2 billion to

profit and loss statistics, the figures on the balance sheet 
total for the institution as a whole, which are reported for 
the monthly balance sheet statistics, are used as a basis. 
The markedly higher balance sheet totals resulting from the provisions of the Act Modernising Accounting Law had an effect for the first time in December 2010; only one-twelfth of these was thus incorporated into the average for the fi-nancial year 2010.

increased by 0.3 percentage point to 23%. This 
means that, overall, gross earnings9 with a total 
share of 95.9% in the operating income is still the key source of income for German credit in-stitutions.
Commission income is likely to have been af -
fected negatively by the marked preference for 
commission-free, highly liquid forms of invest -
ment, restraint in purchasing and risk aversion 
on the part of bank customers as well as falling 
stock market prices as a result of the difficult 
market environment. Moreover, the volume of 
trading on the German stock markets declined 
by more than one-third. This was offset in part by larger trading volumes owing to shifts into 
more crisis-proof forms of investment as well 
as by net acquisitions of investments in secur -
ities and financial derivatives shown at €8.3 bil-
lion in the reporting year in connection with 
financial transactions with non-residents; net 
disposals of €145 billion were reported for this 
in 2010.

stitutions, showed an improvement of €0.4 bil-
lion to €16.2 billion. Most of this was due to 
the category of big banks, for which commis-
sion business traditionally represents a large 
part of operating business. With almost un -
changed commissions received and slightly lower commissions paid, big banks increased 
their net commissions received by €0.4 billion, 
or 3.7%, to €10.6 billion. This meant that, in 
the big banks sector, the share of net commis-
sions received in operating income, at 31.9%, 
roughly matched its 2010 level. Savings banks’ 
net commissions received showed a slight in -
crease to €6.2 billion. Credit cooperatives re -
ported a moderate decline to €4.1 billion. For 
both categories of banks, the share of net commissions received in operating income 
showed hardly any change. In the case of the 
regional institutions of credit cooperatives, net commissions received remained at virtually the same level as in the year before, although their share in operating income increased by 3.3 per -
centage points to 20.0%. Commission business plays a comparatively minor role in the case of Landesbanken; they reported a decline in their 
net commissions received of 9.1% to €1.1 bil -
lion. According to the published annual re -
ports, this was due, among other things, to 
commissions paid for public guarantees as well 
as lower commissions received owing to re -
structuring efforts and concentration on core 
business areas. The share in operating income, at 10%, showed no change.
Declining net profit  
from the trading portfolio
Net income in banks’ own-account trading (in-
cluding customer-induced business) fell for the 
third year in succession, although it was still 
clearly in positive territory, at €4.6 billion, des-pite the difficult market setting. The result was adversely affected mainly by losses on the sale and revaluation of bonds of public issuers, fall-
ing stock prices as well as negative valuation 
adjustments in respect of derivative financial in-
struments. Furthermore, income was reduced by transfers to the special item pursuant to sec-tion 340e (4) of the German Commercial Code, 
which were booked as an expense in the net 
profit or net loss from the trading portfolio. It 
should be noted in this context, however, that 
the own-account trading figures were consid -
erably dented in 2010 by a large transfer to the special item in the case of one of the big banks, which was not repeated on this scale in the re-
porting year. The decline in the own-account trading results would have been much larger 
after adjustment for this exceptional effect. The 
published annual reports show that, in the re -
porting year, there were also isolated cases of 
amounts being withdrawn from the special 
item and booked as income in the net result in order to offset a negative balance.
The category of commercial banks increased its 
profit from own-account trading by €0.3 billion 
to €5.0 billion. A large part in this was played 
by regional banks, for which own-account 
trading is normally of minor importance in op-erating business. Following a negative result in 
2010, they reported a slight profit of €0.4 bil -
lion. Big banks recorded a marginal decline to 
€4.6 billion. The decline was relatively clear in 
the case of Landesbanken and the regional in-stitutions of credit cooperatives, however. Lan-
desbanken made a loss, in fact, with a €1.0 
billion fall in their net result to -€0.5 billion. A 
particular point to note here is that the require-ments to reduce the balance sheet (including a 
reduction of or complete withdrawal from 
own-account trading), which were imposed by the European Commission on some institutions 
in the context of EU state aid control proced -
ures, had a dampening impact on the own-ac-count trading figures of this category of banks. Regional institutions of credit cooperatives saw 
a €0.3 billion reduction in their own-account 
trading profit to €0.2 billion. According to the 
published annual reports, this was attributed primarily to the difficult market environment. 
As in earlier years, own-account trading played 
virtually no part for the other categories of 
banks.Mixed develop-

Slight profit in net other 
 operating income or charges
This item essentially comprises expenses and 
earnings from leasing business, the gross result 
for transactions in goods and subsidiary busi -
ness as well as other operating income or 
charges. A marked increase was reported in 
both other operating income and charges, al -
though this was due mainly to appreciably higher leasing expenses and earnings of indi
-
vidual institutions in the category of regional banks, which largely offset each other. Al
-
though it was possible to show a positive result in net terms in the reporting year at €0.6 billion – in 2010, a negative balance was recorded for 
the first time in the observation period since 
1993 –, the figure was still clearly down on the multi-year average of €2.7 billion.
There were differing developments in net other 
operating income or charges across the individ-ual categories of banks. Both big banks and re-gional banks improved their net result. Regional banks were able to further improve their posi-
tive figure from the previous year by €0.5 bil -
lion to €1.7 billion. Big banks again posted a negative balance, although this was €1.4 bil
-
lion better than in 2010, at €1.1 billion. In ag-
gregate, commercial banks significantly im -
proved their net result from -€1.2 billion to 
€0.7 billion. According to the published annual report, the perceptible deterioration in the case 
of mortgage banks from €0.1 billion to -€0.8 
billion was due chiefly to a single institution.
Administrative spending and 
cost/income ratio
German banks’ administrative spending (€80.1 
billion) was kept at virtually the same level as in the previous year. While staff costs fell by €0.6 
billion to €41.7 billion, there was a slight in -
crease to €38.4 billion in other types of costs 
– mainly other operating expenditure, expend-Result down

iture on third-party services, as well as depreci-
ation of tangible fixed assets. According to the 
published annual reports, the bank levy,10 
which was charged for the first time in the re-
porting year, was also recorded chiefly under 
other administrative spending, although it gen-
erated only €0.6 billion for the Restructuring 
Fund instead of the expected €1.2 billion. The 
amount of the bank levy depends on the pay-
ing institution’s business volume, size and inter -
connectedness in the financial market. The levy 
is collected with due regard to a bank’s eco -
nomic performance based on a reasonable 
limit or contribution ceiling. A lump-sum allow-
ance regulation means that banks with a bal -
ance sheet total, less the deductible positions 
pursuant to section 1 (2) of the restructuring 
fund directive, amounting to less than €300 
million are excepted if an obligation to pay the 
levy does not arise owing to the nominal vol -
ume of derivatives also covered by the banking levy. Smaller institutions – mostly in the savings banks and credit cooperatives sector – are likely 
to be unaffected by the levy owing to their 
small volumes of derivatives. The current under -
lying economic conditions – including the major need for write-downs on Greek sover
-
eign bonds – are cited as a further reason for 
the rather small sum.
Declining staff costs were due mainly to sav -
ings in variable and performance-related salary 
components. According to the published an -
nual reports, this mostly affected the big banks 
sector. The reduction in staff continued at a 
moderate pace. Moreover, the 2010 pay settle-
ment, which provided for a linear 1.6% in -
crease in remuneration in the 2011 reporting year, probably had no more than a moderate 
impact.
German credit institutions nevertheless did not 
entirely match the previous year’s figure for the cost/income ratio, which is often used as an in-
dicator of cost efficiency. There were marginal 
increases of 0.2 percentage point in both the 
ratio of administrative spending to gross earn-
ings (66.6%) and the ratio of administrative spending to total operating income (63.9%). Mortgage banks were especially affected by 
this. Owing to the marked decline in net inter -
est received and heavy strains placed on other operating income or charges, both ratios were at a considerably higher level than in the previ-
ous year; the share of administrative spending Falling staff

10 The bank levy has been charged since 2011 so that the 
banking sector participates in the costs of future measures 
to rescue banks in crisis. The levy contributes to a restruc-turing fund managed by the Financial Market Stabilisation 
Agency (Bundesanstalt für Finanzmarktstabilisierung, FMSA). Contributions are to be paid by all credit institu
-
tions as defined in section 1 (1) of the German Banking Act 
(Kreditwesengesetz, KWG) with the exception of promo -
tional banks and bridge institutions.Deutsche Bundesbank

in gross earnings went up by 14.4 percentage 
points to 51.5% and its share in total operating 
income by as much as 37.3 percentage points 
to 73.6%. By contrast – mainly as a result of 
reduced administrative spending with virtually 
unchanged gross earnings – big banks reported 
an improvement in this ratio of 2 percentage 
points to 81.1%. The ratio of administrative ex-
penditure to total operating income was even 
more favourable in this category of banks; 
owing to a marked year-on-year decline in the 
negative balance reported in other operating 
income in the year under review, the ratio fell 
by as much as 4.9 percentage points to 72.5%.
Valuation result boosts 
 operating result
In the reporting year, the net result incorpor -
ated income from value adjustments in respect 
of securities in the liquidity reserve and of loans and advances as well as from the liquidation of 
provisions in lending business amounting to 
€14.2 billion – the highest figure so far in the 
observation period since 1993. This contrasted 
with charges from write-offs and write-downs 
of these items and from transfers to provisions in lending business amounting to €11.9 billion. 
For the first time in the observation period 
since 1993, this resulted in a positive outcome of €2.3 billion for net income or charges from 
the valuation of securities in the liquidity re -
serve, loans and advances; in the previous year, a figure of −€15.4 billion was reported for this 
item. According to the published data, the 
valuation result11 was positively affected by in-
come generated by the reallocation of undis -
closed reserves pursuant to section 340f of the 
German Commercial Code into disclosed re -
serves pursuant to section 340g of the German 
Commercial Code (fund for general banking risks). In the present analysis of performance, 
income from the liquidation of undisclosed re-serves pursuant to section 340f of the German 
Commercial Code is recorded under the valu -
ation result and increases the profit for the 
year, whereas transfers to the fund for general banking risks do not reduce the profit for the 
year but are allocated to the accumulation of 
reserves as part of appropriation of profit (for 
details, see the box on pages 27-28).
In the reporting year, €19.4 billion on balance 
was allocated to the fund for general banking 
risks,12 which was by far the largest amount in 
the observation period since 1993. The savings 
banks sector accounted for €12 billion of this 
sum. The associated strengthening of the tier 1 capital base is due to the more stringent capital 
and liquidity regulations at the European level 
(CRD IV) scheduled for 2013. A capital deduc -
tion item for certain indirect holdings is one of 
the measures to be implemented. In the sav -
ings banks sector, this concerned participating 
interests held indirectly – via their associations, 
for example – in Landesbanken, insurance 
companies, and building and loan associations; if no exemptions can be claimed, such a deduc-tion item would place a considerable strain on 
the savings banks’ capital base. There were 
also larger net transfers to the fund for general 
banking risks than in the previous year in the case of the regional institutions of credit co
-
operatives (€1.0 billion), credit cooperatives 
(€3.0 billion), and special purpose banks (€2.1 
billion).
All categories of banks with the exception of big banks reported an improvement in their 
valuation result. Big banks suffered a slight fall; savings banks, the regional institutions of credit 
cooperatives, special purpose banks and 
branches of foreign banks even reported a net 
valuation income. Savings banks, in particular, 
achieved their best result in the observation 
period since 1993 with an increase of €10.9 bil-
lion to €7.4 billion. Regional institutions of 
credit cooperatives considerably increased their net valuation income by €1.1 billion. According Positive valu-

The effect of reallocating undisclosed reserves pursuant 
to section 340f of the German Commercial Code as disclosed reserves pursuant to section 340g of the German Commercial Code on the annual profi  t in the profi  t and loss statistics
Due to the specifi  c risks to which banks are 
exposed in the macroeconomic and inter-
national environment, and given the par-
ticular macroeconomic importance of bank-
ing, banks are permitted to make use of special risk provisioning options. To a cer-tain degree, these options help to ensure that a stable overview of their net assets 
and profi  tability can be provided, with the 
objective of maintaining confi  dence, par-
ticularly in crisis situations.
To make provisions for the particular risks of 
the banking business, credit institutions are 
therefore allowed to form disclosed re-
serves pursuant to section 340g of the Ger-
man Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch). These reserves are taxable and must 
be disclosed and recorded on the liabilities 
side of the balance sheet in the special item fund for general banking risks. Transfers to and withdrawals from the fund for general 
banking risks must be shown separately in 
the profi  t and loss account. There is no pre-
defi  ned cap on the amounts that can be 
transferred, subject to the principles of pru-
dent commercial judgment. Because this special item is disclosed and can be com-pared with the retained profi  ts, it is allo-cated to regulatory core tier 1 capital. By 
transposing the EC Bank Accounts Directive into German law (Act (1993) Implementing 
the EC Bank  Accounts Directive (Bank-bilanz richt linie- Gesetz)), the Bundesbank underlined the fact that the fund for gen-eral banking risks is closely related to the 
retained profi  ts by ensuring that entries re-lated to this fund do not have an effect on income in the performance analysis, but are allocated instead to the accumulation of re-serves through the appropriation of profi  t.
As well as allowing banks to form unlimited 
disclosed reserves, section 340f of the Ger-man Commercial Code also permits the for-
mation of undisclosed reserves. However, the total amount must not exceed 4% of the claims on credit institutions and cus-
tomers and of the securities in the liquidity 
reserve. In contrast to the disclosed re-serves, income and expenditure linked to 
the formation and release of these contin-
gency reserves may be offset against cer-tain other expenditure and income com-ponents and reported as a net amount in 
the net valuation result in the profi  t and loss account (cross-offsetting). The formation or 
release of these reserves is therefore no longer apparent from the profi  t and loss  account, so that, to some extent, certain 
losses could be balanced discreetly. The un-
disclosed reserves held are not apparent 
from the balance sheet either, because they 
are recorded through direct write-downs on the corresponding asset items. There-
fore, although they are otherwise identical 
to disclosed reserves, they do not meet the

to the published data, undisclosed reserves 
were reallocated to disclosed reserves on a 
large scale in these two categories. Credit co -
operatives clearly reduced their net valuation 
charges by €2.0 billion to €0.3 billion. The €2.3 billion fall in net valuation charges to €0.7 bil-lion at the Landesbanken was due not only to 
successful restructuring measures but also to 
the hedging effect of a second loss guarantee 
provided by the relevant public institutions in the case of one Landesbank.
13 Mortgage 
banks, too, markedly reduced their net valu -
ation charges by €.0.8 billion to €1.6 billion. 
According to the published annual reports, this was essentially due to a small number of insti-tutions. The slight fall in the valuation result in the case of the big banks – their net valuation 
charges went up by €0.2 billion to €1.9 bil -
lion – was due to mixed developments within 
this category of banks.14
According to the published data, the develop -
ment of the valuation result on the securities in the liquidity reserve chiefly had a negative im -
pact. Losses on sales owing to sharp falls in prices as well as large write-downs – particu
-
larly in the case of government bonds from the euro crisis countries – are likely to have played a large part in this.
Given robust domestic economic activity and a 
high level of employment as well as rising real 
incomes, it was again possible to make a 
marked reduction in risk provisioning (compris-ing write-downs and write-offs as well as pro-
visions) in lending business. This was also re -
flected by overall developments in private and Risk provisioning 
for securities  
in the liquidity reserve
Risk provisioning 
in lending  businessserves cannot be treated equally for the 
purposes of the profi  t and loss statistics. Re-
allocating undisclosed reserves as disclosed 
reserves, which is primarily an accounting 
measure and has no effect on earnings, is 
therefore refl  ected in the Bundesbank’s per-
formance analysis as follows: income from 
releasing undisclosed reserves is recorded in 
the net valuation result and increases the 
profi  t for the year. Expenditure from trans-
fers to the fund for general banking risks 
does not reduce the profi  t for the year. In-
stead, it is allocated to the appropriation of 
profi  t (accumulation of reserves).
Until now, reallocations of this type have 
not played a major role and have not had a 
noticeable impact on the annual profi  t, nor 
therefore on the analysis on profi  tability. 
However, it is highly likely that the planned 
changes to capital and liquidity rules at European level (CRD IV), which come into force in EU member states in 2013, will no 
longer allow contingency reserves to be recognised as tier 2 capital. To strengthen 
their core capital base and in anticipation of 
the planned tightening of regulatory re-
quirements, several institutions have there-
fore already begun the full or partial reclas-
sifi  cation of undisclosed reserves as dis-closed reserves as part of their annual ac-
counting process for 2011. In the profi  t and loss statistics, the release of undisclosed re-
serves, which was carried out on a large 
scale in certain categories of banks, has 
pushed up the reported profi  t for the year 
accordingly (“reallocation effect”). In order 
to prevent misinterpretations, it is therefore 
necessary to view releases of undisclosed 
reserves that are recognised as income in connection with the transfers to the fund 
for general banking risks booked as appro-priation of profi  t.
13 According to the published annual report, this positive 
effect was dampened by the one-off payment to the public 
bodies set in the context of the EU state aid procedures, 
which was recorded as a charge in the extraordinary result.
14 While the published data show that one big bank re -
ported a marked increase in net valuation charges owing to 
a large transfer to risk provisions for a single credit expos-
ure, another big bank stated that a marked reduction of 
risk provisioning in lending business and successful restruc-turing measures were the main reasons for a net valuation income.Deutsche Bundesbank

commercial insolvencies in Germany, which de-
creased by 5.4% in the reporting year. The total 
volume of outstanding claims in these insolv -
ency proceedings was down by as much as 
19%.15 Greater capital adequacy and generally 
problem-free access to external financing 
meant that the number of large-scale insolven-cies fell in the corporate sector, too.
The considerable improvement in the valuation 
result led to the operating result being higher 
for the first time than the operating result be -
fore the valuation of assets. At €47.5 billion, it 
was an impressive €17.2 billion better than in 
the previous year and was thus the highest fig-
ure in the observation period since 1993.
Major strains on the extra-
ordinary result
As in the three preceding years, the extraordin-
ary account impaired profitability in 2011 on a 
major scale, however. The negative balance grew by €4.5 billion to €17.0 billion caused 
mainly by a sharp rise of €8 billion to €10.4 bil-lion in net charges in financial investment busi-
ness. According to the published annual re -
ports, this was due chiefly to the extraordinary write-downs on Greek government bonds that 
became necessary in connection with the 
 sovereign debt crisis and which affected almost 
all categories of banks.16 At €4.2 billion, 
write-downs were at a very high level in the 
category of mortgage banks, although these 
were concentrated on a small number of insti-tutions, according to the published data.
Charges and income from loss transfers, which 
largely offset each other on balance, showed 
the largest increase in the observation period 
since 1993. According to the published annual 
reports, this was due mainly to one large loss 
transfer by a big bank for a subsidiary from the 
category of mortgage banks. For the mortgage banks, the matching income from loss transfers 
was perceptibly higher than the write-downs 
on financial investment, which was the key fac-tor in this being the sole category of banks to 
post a net profit in the extraordinary account.
The reduction in net extraordinary income and 
charges in the narrower definition17 had an al-
leviating effect on the extraordinary account.

16 In a statement of 7  February 2012, the Institut der 
 Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] 
(IDW) made clear that, in the light of current findings, there 
existed a need for write-downs on Greek government 
bonds of well over 50% and that these are to be taken into 
account with retroactive effect as of the balance sheet date 
(31  December 2011) in accordance with the principle 
(Wertaufhellungsprinzip) which requires the inclusion of all 
risks and losses that have arisen in the past financial year 
but only become known between the cut-off date and the time the annual accounts are prepared.

financial year are recorded in this item. This includes mer -

dinary account was due chiefly to a marked re-
duction (of €1.5 billion to €1.2 billion) in net 
losses at the Landesbanken. In 2010, this item 
was strongly affected by one special factor.18
Profit for the financial year 
and balance sheet profit
Against the backdrop of the planned tighten -
ing of regulatory requirements in some cat -
egories of banks, undisclosed reserves were li -
quidated – sometimes on a large scale – in the 
reporting year in order to transfer them to the 
fund for general banking risks for strengthen -
ing the tier 1 capital base. As a result of this 
measure, which was undertaken largely for bal-
ance sheet motives, there was a sharp rise in the profit for the financial year before tax to 
€30.5 billion in the present performance analy-sis. The reporting year thus showed the largest 
profit for the financial year before tax since 
2005. The return on equity likewise increased by 3.2 percentage points to 8.4% (see the 
chart on page 31). To avoid misinterpretations, liquidations of undisclosed reserves recognised as income have to be seen in connection with the net transfers to the fund for general bank-ing risks booked as appropriation of profit (for more details, see the box on pages 27-28). The 
aggregate profit for the financial year before tax less net transfers to the fund for general banking risks (adjusted profit for the financial 
year) amounted to no more than €11.1 billion 
and was thus €0.6 billion down on the year. 
The return on equity, which is calculated on the 
basis of the adjusted profit for the financial 
year, fell from 3.4% to 3.1%.
Despite high income from loss transfers, the annual loss for the financial year before tax 
worsened by €0.2 billion to €0.3 billion at the Clear improve-

mortgage banks; the return on equity fell by 
1.2 percentage points to -1.7%. Big banks 
posted a loss for the financial year before tax, 
albeit only a slight one,19 compared with a 
profit of €2.0 billion generated in the previous 
year. This was due mainly to the loss in the 
extraordinary account as a result of high charges from loss transfers. Regional banks 
nearly doubled their profit for the financial year 
to €2.0 billion, mainly owing to the improve -
ment in their net interest income, thus shaping 
the positive outcome in the category of com -
mercial banks, which showed a profit for the financial year of €2.2 billion (compared with 
€3.3 billion in the year before). In line with this, 
the return on equity at commercial banks 
showed a decline on the year, falling by 1.2 per -
centage points to 1.8%. After making a loss for three years in succession, Landesbanken again showed a small profit for the financial year be-
fore tax of €0.1 billion. This result was due 
mainly to a decline in net valuation charges, al-
though this was partly offset by a marked de -
terioration in the net trading result. The return 
on equity in this category of banks was 0.1% (compared with -1.5% in the year before). 
Credit cooperatives showed a marked improve-ment to €7.0 billion in their profit for the finan-
cial year before tax, particularly as a result of 
declining net valuation charges; the return on 
equity went up by 4.3 percentage points to 16.4%. Savings banks and regional institu
-
tions of credit cooperatives recorded very large increases, however. Principally as a result of the 
“reallocation effect”, savings banks substan -
tially increased their profit for the financial year before tax to €16.8 billion (compared with €6.6 billion in the previous year) and regional institu-tions of credit cooperatives’ profit for the finan-
cial year before tax went up to €1.2 billion 
(compared with €0.6 billion in the previous 
year). Savings banks’ adjusted profit for the fi-
nancial year amounted to only €4.8 billion 
(compared to €4.4 billion in the previous year). 
At €0.2 billion, the corresponding figure for the regional institutions of credit cooperatives was 
nearly at the same level as in 2010. Savings banks’ return on equity amounted to 27.3% (compared with 11.4% in the previous year), 
which was the highest figure in the observation 
period since 1994; calculated on the basis of 
the adjusted profit for the financial year, the re-turn on equity was only 7.8% (compared with 7.6% one year earlier). The regional institutions 
of credit cooperatives reported an increase of 
4.5 percentage points to 10.3%, thus achieving a double-digit return on equity for the first time since 2001; based on the adjusted profit for the 
financial year, the return on capital was no more than 1.7%, which was, in fact, 0.6 per
-
centage points down on the year.
The marked improvement in the aggregate an-
nual result before tax (as defined in the statis -
tics on the profit and loss accounts), which was 
principally concentrated on the savings banks 
sector, was also reflected by the change in the Profit for the

distribution of the return on assets before tax. 
A matching shift to the right in the positive 
area was apparent, above all, in the best prof-
itability category (return on assets of 0.9% or 
more), where the number of institutions almost 
doubled to 941. Although this meant that more than half of all the institutions in the reporting 
population – in 2011, this consisted of 1,778 
institutions – were in this profitability category, their share in the aggregate balance sheet total of the German banking system, at 13.0% (com-pared with 5.5% in the previous year) was still comparatively small. In the area of negative re-
turn on assets, there was a small increase of three to 59, although their weight, measured 
by the aggregate balance sheet total, was vir -
tually unchanged at 20.4%. Overall, these insti-tutions had to cope with a considerable loss for the financial year before tax of €6.4 billion.
Taking due account of higher taxes on income 
and earnings and after appropriation of profit 
(before distribution), there was an aggregate balance sheet loss for the fourth time in suc -
cession; at €1.1 billion, this was €0.3 billion 
more than in the previous year. As in 2010, the 
aggregate balance sheet loss was due, first and 
foremost, to losses of the mortgage banks (€4.7 billion), special purpose banks (€0.8 bil
-
lion) as well as, to a lesser extent, to losses of regional banks (€0.5 billion) and Landesbanken 
(€0.4 billion); according to the published an -
nual reports, the negative balance sheet results 
were concentrated – as in the previous year – 
on a small number of institutions. By contrast, all other categories of banks showed an aggre-gate balance sheet profit of €5.2 billion.
Marked effects were produced by net transfers 
to the fund for general banking risk amounting 
to €19.4 billion (after €6.1 billion in 2010). In 
the reporting year, such transfers were much in 
evidence in the case of savings banks (€12.0 billion after €2.2 billion in 2010) and the re
-
gional institutions of the credit cooperatives (€1.0 after €0.4 billion in 2010). Despite their Aggregate

large profit for the financial year, savings banks’ 
balance sheet profit (€1.6 billion) showed only 
a marginal improvement on the year; the re -
gional institutions of credit cooperatives’ bal -
ance sheet profit fell by as much as €0.2 billion to €0.1 billion. Furthermore, net losses brought 
forward of €7.4 billion (compared with €8.6 
billion in 2009 and €9.1 billion in 2010) placed 
a strain on the aggregate financial result, al -
though – as in earlier years – such losses were 
essentially concentrated on individual mort -
gage banks, special purpose banks and re -
gional banks. As in 2010, these negative factors affecting the result were accompanied by com-
paratively small net withdrawals from reserves 
and participation rights capital in the amount of €2.0 billion. A stabilisation of the earnings situation was thus becoming apparent in the 
second year following the crisis years of 2008 
and 2009 – in 2008 and 2009, net withdrawals amounted to €20.6 billion and €13.1 billion re-spectively. Even so, the tensions in the financial markets, the uncertain global economic setting and the fallout from the sovereign debt crisis 
were clearly reflected in the profit and loss ac-count, as net transfers were usual in most cases before the crisis years.
Outlook
The first half of the current financial year saw a 
noticeable weakening in the performance of large German banks with an international focus
20 which report under the IFRS and for 
which consolidated quarterly reports are avail -
able. The half-year results before tax still clearly showed a profit at €6.6 billion, but were €3.5 billion down on the comparable period in 2011. The key factors behind this development were

ness as well as continuing risk aversion owing 
to the, as yet, unresolved sovereign debt crisis. 
Added to this, risk provisioning in lending busi-ness was almost doubled.
Given the continuing tense situation in the 
international financial markets and the associ -
ated considerable market uncertainties that 
can be observed at present, this basic constel-
lation is unlikely to change substantially as the 
year progresses. Increased risk provisioning is 
due, not least, to the current crisis in the ship-
building market. Furthermore, the macroeco -
nomic outlook in Germany makes a trend in -
crease in such provisioning appear likely. Al -
though economic activity in Germany has been 
robust so far, there are recognisable signs of a slowdown; this is also evident from the recently 
published sentiment indicators. In particular, 
economic activity could be impaired on the ex-
ternal side more strongly than hitherto by de -
velopments in the euro area. Nor is it possible to rule out additional impairments in securities activities later in the year; as in the 2011 finan-
cial year, this would probably affect own-account trading and securities in the liquidity 
reserve. German banks do not expect a marked 
deterioration in credit quality, however. Given largely unchanged credit standards, the do -
mestic banking sector’s lending to non-financial 
corporations and households has remained in 
expansionary territory in the year so far, with 
loans for house purchase increasing even more 
strongly than before. Under the impact of a further fall in interest rates in the money and capital markets, bank interest rates have now 
hit new lows. Although conditions for deposits 
have been adjusted downwards sharply against 
the backdrop of an almost incessant inflow of 
funds, overall there is still a trend decline in the 
gross interest margin in existing business, 
which provides an indication of the trend in the 
interest margin. In view of the rather subdued 
outlook for earnings potential in core business 
areas as well as persistent uncertainty, there are 
growing reports that the earnings situation is 
to be stabilised by a reduction in costs, say, by means of further cuts in staff.
The trend towards shifting activities into low-
risk and low-margin business areas is likely to 
continue; this is to be supported not least from 
a macropudential standpoint in terms of safe -
guarding the required future tier 1 capital 
ratios, even though it might limit earnings po-tentials in the short term.Subdued

Innovations in payment systems
The dynamic advances in information and communication technology have ushered in a raft of 
new products in the field of payment systems. While online banking is now firmly established in Germany, contactless payment facilities in the retail trade, new payment procedures for internet 
purchases, the use of mobile phones and technology enabling the transfer of funds from one 
account to another in a matter of seconds are at the centre of interest today.
Even though many payment innovations are still in the process of being phased in and gradually 
extended, these developments are regarded as having high growth potential. Innovations in this 
area may bring about major changes in the payment services market and could, for example, 
weaken the role of banks in this traditional area of their activities. There are already signs that 
competition in the payments sector is likely to increase owing to the technological know-how and 
broad customer bases of non-bank service providers such as web merchants or mobile phone 
companies. These tendencies can also be observed at an international level, as reported in a recently published study by the Basel Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) 
entitled “Innovations in Retail Payments”.
Central banks have a vested interest in facilitating the efficient and secure settlement of payments 
because of their statutory mandate. It is for this reason that they keep a close eye on current 
payment trends and developments and assess whether additional action needs to be taken. Such 
action might include expanding their oversight activities and stepping up cooperation with other national or international authorities. But central banks also need to consider the implications of innovation for their own provision of services and for monetary policy.
Besides technological advances and changes in user habits, the main drivers of innovation have 
been the regulatory framework, the degree of standardisation and cooperation, the price struc-ture and security. These factors have simultaneously caused the payment services market to fea-ture more prominently in the political debate in Europe and the world as a whole, as evidenced 
by the emergence of payment system forums involving service providers, users and regulators 
and by the increasing activity of competition authorities, for example in connection with deter-mining the admissibility of interbank fees. In particular, the establishment of the Single Euro Pay-ments Area (SEPA) is expected to generate innovative impetus across Europe.Deutsche Bundesbank

Dynamic developments in 
cashless payments
In the course of the last fifty years, cashless 
payment systems in Germany have developed 
at a rapid pace.1 Currently, almost 18 billion 
payments worth around €68 trillion are ef -
fected in Germany every year, which is equiva-
lent to 212 payments totalling about 
€31,000 per capita. Among the major develop-
ments in recent years are the increasing import-
ance of card payments and the rapid growth of 
online banking. Over the past decade, use of 
online banking facilities has more than doubled; 
just over 45% of Germans above the age of 16 
now use the internet to access their giro ac -
count.2 This increasing availability of the inter -
net has also led to significant changes in con -
sumers’ purchasing habits. At present, just over 
5% of all retail sales in Germany are already 
generated by e-commerce.3 This has also left its 
mark in the world of payments, for example in 
the form of new or enhanced conventional 
payment schemes.
Advances in information and communication 
technology have also paved the way for pro -
gress in payment operations and systems else-
where in the world. Over the past ten years, the number of internet users has more than 
quadrupled globally to around 2.2 billion. With 
almost six billion users to date, the mobile 
phone sector has expanded even more rapidly. 
The same applies to developing countries, 
where, statistically, as many as eight out of ten 
people possess a mobile phone.4 This notably 
fosters hopes of providing financial services 
through this channel to the more than 2.5 bil-
lion individuals around the world who have 
hitherto had no access to bank accounts.
Emerging market economies such as Brazil, China, India, Korea, Russia and Saudi Arabia 
have used the past few years to systematically modernise their payment infrastructures. These countries have flourishing economies with high 
double-digit growth rates in payment transac -
tions, whereas in Europe and the United States growth in payments is in the low single-digit 
range. This is largely the result of the different 
degrees of development within the payments 
segment, as reflected, for example, in the wide international divergence in the annual number 
of per capita payment transactions. Almost 
every country has witnessed major growth in 
card payments in recent years; in the countries 
represented on the Committee on Payment 
and Settlement Systems (CPSS),5 credit and 
debit cards account for over 50% of payment 
transactions and are now the predominant in -
strument for cashless payments.
Central banks attach great importance to 
payment-related innovations because such de-
velopments generally have an impact on both 
efficiency and security. Efficient and secure pay-
ment systems are essential to a smoothly func-tioning real economy and a key factor in main-taining confidence in a country’s financial infra-
structure. They are therefore ultimately indis -
pensable as a means of ensuring confidence in the national currency itself. Mindful of this fact, 
the central banks represented on the CPSS 
tasked a working group with examining the lat-est trends in the field of payments. The report, 
which was recently published,6 gives an over -
view of significant innovations observed in this 
field and analyses similarities detected among 
these trends as well as positive and negative 
determinants. The group was also tasked with assessing the consequences and challenges for Payment system 
developments

central banks that are likely to arise from these 
developments.
The analysis was based on a fact-finding survey 
conducted among CPSS central banks regard -
ing innovations in retail payments in their re -
spective countries over the past decade. In 
addition, the report focuses on selected devel-
opments in a number of other countries. A 
total of 122 innovations from 30 countries 
were catalogued, with attention paid to both 
product innovations, for example in the form 
of new or materially enhanced payment instru-ments or solutions, and to process innovations. 
Since the attributes “new” and “materially en-
hanced” are both relative criteria which de -
pend on the situation in the individual country, a broad range of relevant trends was covered.An overview of innovative 
payment schemes
Recent developments in international, Euro -
pean and national payment systems can gener -
ally be assigned to one of the following five 
categories:
– innovative card payments,
– internet payments,
– mobile payments,
– electronic bill presentment and payment 
(EBPP)7 and
– improvements in infrastructure and security.
In Germany, as in the rest of Europe, the first 
three listed categories are of particular import-
ance.Basis for

In Germany, very high expectations are at -
tached to the deployment of contactless tech-
nology (near field communication, NFC) for 
card payments as it enables payments at point-of-sale (POS) terminals to be processed more speedily. At present, a large-scale pilot project known as “girogo” and based on the 
e-money system GeldKarte is being run by the 
German banking sector in Lower Saxony. The 
GeldKarte constitutes a prepaid electronic wal-
let (also referred to as a prepaid card) which has thus far been primarily used for effecting payment at parking meters and public trans
-
port ticket dispensers. In addition to being used for the contactless payment of purchases up to a value of €20, another new feature will in fu-ture enable the holder to automatically top up his/her GeldKarte balance at the POS, thus pre-venting the cancellation of a transaction due to insufficient funds. The savings bank sector has 
already announced its intention to equip the more than 40 million cards for which it is re
-
sponsible with an NFC capability in the coming 
years. Parallel to this, the international credit card companies MasterCard and Visa are en
-
deavouring to establish their contactless card products in the German market. At the inter
-
national level, too, contactless payment 
schemes and prepaid solutions are the predom-
inant lines of development within the innova-
tive card payments category. Prepaid cards have a particularly important role to play in 
allowing individuals without any access to bank accounts to settle payments on a cashless basis 
or, for example, enabling government transfer 
payments to be made without any need for 
cash.
However, in the next few years, innovations are 
also likely to raise the level of acceptance of 
payment cards. With 700,000 acceptance ter -
minals now in place, the level of market pene-
tration in Germany is very high, not least in the 
case of large and medium-sized trading com -
panies. However, for small-scale merchants, 
hotel and restaurant proprietors who are averse to investing in the requisite infrastructure there 
is still much untapped growth potential which 
could be exploited, for example, by using mo-bile phones as a card terminal.
Thanks to the growth of online shopping in 
Germany, specialised online payment schemes 
are gaining in popularity. Internet payments 
refer to all e-commerce payments transmitted 
by customers to their payment service provider 
using the internet as an access channel; it is 
immaterial whether the access device used is a conventional PC, a tablet computer or a smart-phone.Innovative card

In Germany, two variants of payments via inter -
net play a leading role. First, over the past few 
years, a number of schemes have been 
launched on the market which are based on 
payment by credit transfer using the purchas -
er’s online banking application. The main play-ers here are “Giropay”, a system operated col-lectively by German banks which forwards cus-
tomers directly from the e-merchant’s website 
to their online banking application for the pur -
pose of payment, and “sofortüberweisung.de” under which a technical service provider (non-bank) triggers a credit transfer for the customer 
in his/her online banking application. Second, 
special internet-based electronic payment 
schemes are available that enable transfers of 
electronic money (e-money)8 between ac -
counts held within the network. The most fre-
quently used provider of this service in Ger -
many is PayPal,9 whose platform not only en -
ables the user to transfer prepaid e-money bal-
ances but also accepts payments by credit card and credit transfer or, in the case of Germany, 
by direct debit from a bank account.
In Germany, there is also a growing awareness 
of the option of payment by mobile phone. In 
many pilot projects, however, mobile phones 
or devices are merely a substitute for a credit or 
debit card inasmuch as they can be fitted, for 
example, with a sticker which assumes the 
function of the card or incorporate a SIM card 
with a payment card function. In other in -
stances, mobile phones are used solely to gain 
authorisation. This is achieved by sending a 
transaction authentication number (TAN) which 
is needed in order to conclude the payment 
process. By contrast, genuine mobile (phone) 
payments are characterised by the fact that Mobile

8 This refers to prepaid balances in the prevailing currency which are stored on cards or computer servers and which can be used to effect payment not just on the part of the issuer but also for third parties.

they are initiated and transmitted using mobile 
communication networks or technologies. For 
instance, in some locations in Germany mobile 
phone parking is available, in other words park-
ing fees can be paid by means of a text mes -
sage which is charged to the participant’s mo-bile phone bill. In addition to the various exist-ing local SMS-based payment solutions for the 
purchase of local public transport tickets, it is 
possible that in the next few years the market 
will see an influx of products offering mobile 
payment applications (apps) involving a direct 
debit (collection of funds from the user’s bank account).
While in some countries, specialised proced -
ures or technical platforms have been de -
veloped for the purpose of electronic bill pre-
sentment and payment (EBPP) or purely for 
paying bills, such tools play only a minor role in 
Germany, at least in business-to-person deal -
ings. This is attributable, first, to the still high 
proportion of paper-based bills in use. A second 
factor is that electronic invoicing mostly in -
volves bills being transmitted as an e-mail at -
tachment.10 Furthermore, the German collec -
tion authorisation direct debit scheme is a pro-
cedure that offers consumers a convenient, easy-to-use and secure payment instrument, 
especially for ongoing payment obligations.
Innovations designed to accelerate payment 
processing or to make it significantly more effi-
cient are of limited importance in Europe. In some countries, for example, payment by cheque continues to play a major role, and 
thus the digitisation of cheque processing has 
been pursued as a high priority of late. This contrasts with Germany, where cheques are now only of marginal importance and the 
changeover to fully automated processing was already achieved a number of years ago. Con-
versely, both internationally and within Ger -
many, the security aspect is becoming increas-ingly important, as demonstrated by the imple-
mentation of the two-factor authentication 
(2FA) of payments.11 To cite an example, inter -
net payments executed using a credit card can be made much more secure by asking the user 
to enter an additional password (known as a 
3D secure code).
Trends in the development 
of payment methods and systems
The large number of innovative developments 
and products demonstrates the dynamic evolu-
tion of payment methods and systems. In Ger -
many, however, many of these innovative pay-ment instruments are either still in the pilot or 
test phase or have only been able to secure a 
very limited foothold in the market in terms of their scope of application, for example in con-nection with ticketing or vending machines. In typical payment situations, conventional means of payment and payment instruments continue to prevail. In Germany, cash is by far the most 
commonly used method of payment at mer -
chant points of sale as well as for private trans-actions (person-to-person payments).
12 Regular 
payments (eg rent), but also e-commerce pay-
ments (eg payment before or after receipt of goods), are frequently settled by means of 
credit transfer or direct debit. Similar trends can 
be discerned in cross-country comparisons. In 
fact, only in a small number of cases and in 
very few countries have innovations been able to make the transition to one of the most com-monly used payment instruments.
It should be noted, however, that most innov-
ations are relatively new and have not been on 
the market long enough to become properly established. A study conducted by the ECB

comes to the conclusion that most innovations 
relating to European payments are still in the 
introduction or growth phase. Accordingly, the 
projected market potential for innovations is a long way from being met.
Non-banks are taking on an increasingly im -
portant role in the area of payments by acting as payment service providers without a banking 
licence in the conventional sense. Aside from technical factors, this development has also 
been fostered by the regulatory framework. In 
some cases, non-banks and the services they 
provide operate in a regulatory gap for which 
no legal rules have been deemed necessary up 
to now. In many countries, however, the regu-
latory provisions have since been adjusted to 
allow certain services to be provided not just by 
traditional banks, as in the past, but also by 
non-banks. These use innovative technologies 
to apply their specific technical expertise to 
payment transactions or to harness their exist-
ing customer base for this area of activity. In terms of customer numbers, non-banks are the 
leading providers in the field of internet and 
mobile payments. In many instances, the in -
volvement of a non-bank leads to an interrup-
tion of the traditional supply chain for pay -
ments, which has been dominated by banks. For example, in the case of “sofortüberwei
-
sung.de”, the non-bank provider is included in the communications loop linking the merchant, 
the purchaser and his/her bank. Non-banks, 
such as the mail order company Amazon, serve inter alia as payment portals inasmuch as they 
allow registered merchants to use either their 
own designated processing platform or to choose from several other payment channels 
on a one-stop basis.
In many cases, innovations in retail payments 
are specifically aimed at speeding up process-
ing. They are being driven by concrete market 
demand, technological progress and, in some 
instances, regulatory pressure. On the one 
hand, these innovations are designed to accel-Growing

erate the initiation of payment, be this as a POS 
transaction or an e-commerce purchase. For 
example, the aforementioned options for con-
tactless retail payments have the potential to 
greatly reduce the time needed to effect pay -
ment at the POS, which is to the benefit of 
both the retailer and the customer. On the other hand, efforts are underway in many 
countries to place the focus of payments more squarely on real-time or almost real-time settle-ment. To achieve this goal it is above all neces-
sary to establish modern, high-speed process -
ing systems to enable the exchange of funds between the payment service providers in
-
volved (interbank payment systems) and to in -
stall the corresponding access paths via which 
customers can initiate payment, be it through 
the internet, by mobile phone or by means of 
telephone banking. The ultimate objective is to ensure account-to-account settlement within a matter of seconds through the almost immedi-
ate crediting of the payment amount to the payee. With regard to e-commerce, for ex
-
ample, this should eliminate the risk incurred 
by a seller if he/she provides services upfront, 
while all parties involved should benefit from 
the liquidity management gains resulting from 
the elimination of processing times. Moreover, customers would be offered a quick electronic 
alternative to cash payments for private trans -
actions (eg pocket money).In Germany, and throughout the European 
Union, the speed of payments processing has 
accelerated significantly over the past ten years. 
Since the beginning of 2012, payment service 
providers have been required by law to ensure 
that payments are credited to the relevant ac -
count at the receiving bank Europe-wide no 
later than the following business day. As a con-
sequence, many interbank payment systems 
have been adjusted to enable same-day or in -
traday settlement between the banks involved. 
For an array of recurring (date-specific) pay -
ments there is clearly no need for a further ac-
celeration of the processing time, ie a shift to 
real-time settlement. In addition, the advan -
tage of immediate receipt of payment by the 
payee using real-time settlement, eg in e-com-
merce transactions, could be replaced by a payment guarantee provided by the bank in 
advance of actual payment processing further 
downstream. Nevertheless, it should be borne 
in mind that internet payment platforms such 
as PayPal can already initiate an immediate 
transfer of funds from one PayPal-registered ac-count to another. The key factor will therefore 
be the stance taken by payment service users: 
while many bank customers are probably con-
tent with the processing speed already on 
offer, they may revise their expectations in the 
future, taking their experience of high-speed 
internet communications as the benchmark for payments processing.
In countries with a high per capita income, 
more than 90 per cent of all households have 
(access to) a bank account, whereas in Latin America, for example, the rate is just 40 per cent and in sub-Saharan countries it is barely 
more than 10 per cent. The concept of “finan-cial inclusion” sets out to extend the provision 
of financial and, in particular, payment-related 
services to include those sectors of the global 
population that have hitherto had no or only 
limited access to these services. Moreover, this 
could simplify the process and, above all, re -
duce the cost of remittances made by resident 
foreign workers to their families back home.

counts, such financial inclusion is only of minor 
importance in Germany. There is virtually no 
demand in Germany for schemes such as the 
provision of accounts with limited functions or non-bank systems for settling mobile payments via prepaid payment cards (which have proved 
innovative drivers of payment transactions in 
countries with less developed bank infrastruc -
tures), nor are these concepts likely to see 
much growth here in the future.
Success factors for payment 
system innovations
The payment services market has a number of 
special features which make it more difficult to introduce new products than in other markets. These include economies of scope and of scale, network effects and a two-sided demand struc-
ture, which is split between merchants and consumers. For an innovation to be commer
-
cially successful it is crucial to achieve a critical 
mass, in other words to reach a sufficiently 
large number of users. This is complicated fur -
ther by the fact that innovations generally have 
to compete against established and widely-used schemes, meaning that (a large number 
of) users need to be persuaded to switch over. 
This may explain why payment system innov -
ations rarely get beyond the pilot phase or need a longer period of time to become ac
-
cepted in the market.
The extent to which innovations develop and succeed depends on several factors. Here, a distinction can be made between exogenous 
and endogenous determinants. While exogen-
ous factors are usually instrumental in deter -
mining the framework conditions in which the 
payment industry operates, providers are better 
equipped to influence endogenous factors 
themselves. Each determinant has the potential 
to foster innovation (driver) or hinder it (bar -
rier), depending on the specific features.
Aside from technical developments, the most 
significant exogenous factor is user behaviour. In order for innovations to succeed, they have 
to meet the payment service user’s needs and 
convince the user that the innovation is super -
ior to existing payment schemes. Numerous 
projects in European countries aimed at intro -
ducing an e-wallet incorporated into payment 
cards have fallen at this hurdle. Likewise, in 
Germany the initially high hopes attached to 
the GeldKarte, which at last count (2011) had 
registered 36 million transactions, have not 
been fulfilled. This was due inter alia to its rela-tive lack of appeal in the eyes of consumers, for 
example owing to its low level of acceptance by retailers and the limited degree of protec
-
tion against financial loss.14 When choosing a 
payment instrument, the key deciding factors for users – both merchants and consumers – are cost, acceptance, speed and safety. With regard to the contactless payment schemes 
currently being piloted in Germany, it will there-fore be extremely important for them to prove 
their practical worth in terms of their advan -
tages for the user, also compared with existing payment methods.
Other factors influencing user choice are the 
specific payment situation and socio-economic aspects (eg age and level of education). It can 
generally be assumed that user preferences 
and payment habits are only likely to change at 
a slow pace. In principle, however, techno -
logical progress, a change of strategy by the provider or altered purchasing behaviour (eg greater internet use) could lead to a higher 
level of acceptance for innovations on the part of users.
The (exogenous) regulatory framework has be-
come increasingly important over time. In re -
cent years, various measures have been taken 
across Europe and in other CPSS countries to 
encourage innovative developments. In many 
cases, the aim was to stimulate competition in 
the payments industry and to increase effi -
ciency by opening up the market to non-banks. 
For example, in 2009 the European Union im -Special features

Special features of the payment services market
Economies of scale
This concept is based on the assumption 
that rising output volumes reduce the aver-
age costs per unit. Economies of scale occur 
when output increases because the high fi  xed costs of production, being unrelated 
to output, can be apportioned to a greater number of products (as long as the system does not reach full capacity). In the fi  eld of payments, economies of scale mainly apply 
to the processing costs in payment service 
providers’ systems or interbank payment 
operations.
Example: if doubling the volume of pay-
ments increased total costs by just 20%, the 
average costs per payment would drop by 
40%.
Economies of scope
In this case, increasing output levels by 
using the same infrastructure to produce 
different goods brings about economies of scale.
Example: the Bundesbank’s Retail Payment 
System (RPS) is used not only for processing 
credit transfers and direct debits but also 
for collecting card and cheque payments.
Network effects
This concept centres around the idea that 
the usefulness of a given service for existing 
users grows in proportion to the total num-ber of users. Hence, the more widespread a service becomes, the greater the benefi  t for 
those using it. Combined with high fi  xed 
costs for providing the payment infrastruc-
ture, this means that a minimum number of users (“critical mass”) needs to be reached if the service is to offer a high value for users.
Example: the benefi  t of a bank card for 
merchants depends on as many customers 
as possible holding the card and being able to use it for payments.
Two-sided marketsAchieving critical mass becomes more diffi   -
cult for providers when demand is split be-
tween two interdependent customer groups, eg merchants and consumers. For providers, this means that they have to reach critical mass on both sides. This is often referred to as the “chicken and egg 
dilemma”. For unless both sides of the mar-
ket have an incentive to simultaneously 
introduce a payment service, that service is destined to fail; the proposition loses its at-tractiveness if only one side is interested.
Example: a new card payment system can only gain acceptance in the market if it is accepted by consumers and merchants 
alike.Deutsche Bundesbank

plemented the Payment Services Directive, 
which created a new category of payment ser -
vice providers with the authority to offer pay -
ment services throughout Europe: payment in-
stitutions. In terms of organisation and capital, the legal requirements for payment institutions are much less stringent than those applying to 
banks which, among other activities, are add -
itionally allowed to conduct deposit and lend -
ing business. In other countries, legislators 
have made targeted changes to existing legisla-
tion. These include enabling the use of more 
efficient payment instruments (eg EBPP) for tax 
payments or adapting the legal framework to 
promote financial inclusion. Moreover, some 
countries have strengthened consumer protec-tion provisions in connection with payment sys-tems and taken steps to enhance transparency regarding fees in the hope that this will motiv-
ate users to favour more cost-effective pay -
ment instruments.
The main determinants that lie in the hands of 
the providers themselves include cooperation 
among providers and mutually agreed com -
mon standards.
Cooperation can either allow high fixed costs 
to be spread among several participating par -
ties or make it easier to reach a critical mass by 
forming a joint pool of potential customers. Such cooperation can be either horizontal or vertical. Horizontal cooperation refers to col
-
laborative arrangements between providers 
acting at the same operational level, as is the 
case when rival card systems facilitate the inter -
operability of terminals for merchants. Vertical 
cooperation, which is gaining in significance as innovative payment services become more and more technically complex, refers to joint efforts 
between providers at different levels of the supply chain. Mobile and internet payment 
processes, in particular, involve a strong degree 
of cooperation between the financial sector and non-bank enterprises. This makes it pos
-
sible, for example, to combine the expertise of 
mobile phone companies in data transfer with banks’ core competence in the management of 
financial risks.
Standardisation is a further key prerequisite if innovation is to succeed. Common standards 
shorten the road to reaching a critical mass as 
they ensure that different providers’ products 
are interoperable and prevent the formation of 
competing insular solutions that lack sufficient 
mass. In addition, a shared platform offers new 
providers a stable basis for breaking into the 
market and avoids the need to invest resources 
in developing alternative technical norms. On the other hand, established standards can hamper innovation if the industry shies away 
from switching to new, improved standards be-cause of the higher costs involved. Above and 
beyond this, it should be ensured that stand -
ardisation follows a transparent and open path from which no party with a legitimate interest is excluded.
In relation to innovations, price-setting is im -
portant in two senses. First, it determines the 
level of earnings providers can expect and is 
thus, alongside the cost factor, a determinant 
of the profitability of a given innovation. 
Second, the price of an innovation is a key de-terminant of the acceptance of that product by 
the user, especially relative to the other pay -
ment methods on offer. In Germany the high level of competitiveness which characterises the market is likely to narrow the scope for 
earning additional profits from innovative prod-ucts.
In Europe, and in other parts of the world, the 
focus of political debate on the price aspect 
has often been restricted to discussion of the 
need for and admissibility of interbank or inter -
change fees. These fees, which are normally 
paid by the retailer’s bank to the cardholder’s 
bank, are designed to distribute the profit 
among all the parties involved and thus make 
users more willing to use the system in ques -
tion. However, one-sided interchange fees 
have also met with criticism in Europe on the 
grounds of competition law and have conse -Endogenous

quently been made subject to regulation. 
Nevertheless, a sound scientific analysis of the 
correlation between innovation and inter -
change fees has yet to be presented; there is a 
need for further theoretical and empirical stud-ies into this aspect.
Innovations offer an opportunity to reduce the 
potential for fraud under existing procedures, 
either through the evolutionary refinement of 
these systems or the use of new ones. With 
respect to card payments, the switch from magnetic stripes to chip technology has 
brought about a considerable reduction in the 
level of damage caused by fraud. Increased use 
of two-factor authentication of late has gener -
ated some major successes in terms of combat-
ing internet payment fraud. At the same time, 
to protect their own interests, providers of in -
novative systems need to give top priority to 
the security aspect of their products as object-
ive shortcomings or subjective doubts on the 
part of users concerning the level of protection 
provided, possibly triggered by press reports, can reduce or even block acceptance. When 
deployed, innovative technologies are often ac-
companied by new risks whose profiles can also change significantly over time. Hence, if 
contactless payment procedures or the use of 
mobile phones for payment purposes are to 
prove successful, users must have no doubts in 
their minds as to the guarantee of security offered by these products. For instance, per
-
sonal data such as card numbers or PIN codes should be safe from interception by any eaves-
dropping technology or malware targeted at 
mobile phones
Consequences for  
central banks
Central banks have a vested interest in ensuring 
the smooth, safe processing of payments. For 
this reason, they keep a close eye on current 
payment-related trends and assess the effects 
on and implications for their own activities. 
Despite this shared interest, central banks’ re -actions to innovative developments display 
some notable differences, which can largely be 
attributed to each central bank’s legal man -
date, its perception of the role it should play 
and specific national circumstances with regard 
to payment systems and operations. Some cen-
tral banks are authorised to institute statutory 
regulations and to impose sanctions, while the powers of others are confined to conducting a dialogue with the market in the form of “moral suasion”. A number of central banks are expli-citly striving to intensify their use of innovative, cashless payment methods (to the detriment of 
cash), whereas others view such decisions as 
the logical outcome of a purely market-driven 
process. Ultimately, it is up to the individual central bank, in line with the country’s statu
-
tory regime, to decide whether and to what extent it wishes to act as a political catalyst, 
overseer and provider of payment services.
Every aspect of central banks’ activity is based 
on the ongoing monitoring and assessment of new developments, for which they are primar -
ily dependent on statistical data. Insufficient 
data can cause them to misjudge the relevance and consequences of innovations. Hence, cen-
tral banks should ensure that the necessary data are available, where appropriate by ad
-
justing the statistical reporting requirements, 
but taking care to avoid bureaucratic obstacles to innovation that may be generated by exces-sive reporting rules. In addition, expanding the 
scope of scientific analysis (research) can help 
to create a better understanding of interde -
pendencies and risk assessments.
As standardisation and interoperability are par -
ticularly important for innovation in terms of 
surmounting economic hurdles, many central 
banks promote these goals by acting as a cata-lyst. Not least thanks to their individual expert-ise in the area of payment operations and sys-tems as well as their neutral position between 
the policymakers and the markets, they are able to assist in overcoming the coordination 
problems which arise when different interests 
are involved. Here it is essential for central Security

banks to make their views, strategic objectives 
and policies transparent. Apart from publishing 
annual reports, some central banks base their 
strategies on public consultations, and occa -
sionally they attempt to embed their envisaged 
goals in the public mind by announcing stra -
tegic guidelines.
Innovations have particular implications for 
central banks’ oversight function. It is therefore 
important for them to review and strengthen their existing oversight framework. For ex
-
ample, the granting of an explicit legal man -
date could effectively increase central banks’ 
efficiency in the area of payment oversight. 
Where applicable, the focus of their oversight 
activities may need to be extended to incorpor -
ate new products and new providers. Further -
more, where the law allows, it may become 
necessary to supplement the set of instruments 
available for payment oversight.
Above and beyond this, innovative develop -
ments turn up the pressure on central banks to 
cooperate with other authorities. This is be -
cause the growing complexity of innovative payment services and the increased role of 
non-banks have a bearing not just on the over -
sight activities of central banks but also on the responsibilities borne by other authorities. Pre-cisely because of the potential implications for 
the security and integrity of payment services, 
it is vital to have a harmonised regulatory 
framework which, ideally, places the same de-mands on different market players – banks and 
non-banks – with similar functions and avoids 
systemic risks and competitive distortions. This 
would also help to counter any potential 
double regulation of participants which could 
possibly ensue from the parallel activities of dif-
ferent authorities each operating independ -
ently. Likewise, the quality of regulation can be improved by making use of the expertise avail-able in different fields. Owing to the high level of technical complexity involved, central banks would also be well advised to work closely with the authorities that are responsible for IT secur -
ity. Although many innovations remain con -fined to the national level, in this era of accel-erating globalisation it makes sense to deepen 
international cooperation and, for example, apply harmonised standards so as to prevent regulatory arbitrage in which providers move 
their operations to more lightly regulated juris-dictions.
Central banks can also promote innovation dir -
ectly by modernising their own range of ser -
vices. In the past few years, a number of cen-
tral banks have made available new, high-end 
interbank payment systems and thus laid the 
basis for an innovative payment processing landscape. Central banks might also be af
-
fected by an accelerated transition to real-time 
payment processing in the retail sector as this 
would generate competition for the central 
banks’ own real-time gross settlement systems, which are used not just for processing financial 
market transactions but frequently for urgent 
customer payments as well.
Payment system innovations could result in a 
reduced demand for cash and, to put it more 
generally, curb commercial banks’ demand for 
central bank money. This would complicate the task of managing monetary policy via the inter -
est rate channel. Related analyses investigating 
the emergence of e-money were already con -
ducted more than a decade ago. What is of 
greater relevance today is the advent of virtual 
currencies, which are being used as payment 
tools on several social networks. Most central 
banks, however, do not currently see payment 
system innovations as a threat to monetary 
policy. For one thing, no significant substitution effects detrimental to cash have been observed 
to date. For another, central banks have 
enough other options to ensure their ongoing 
ability to steer the demand for central bank 
money, which is key to monetary policy.

products. As a result, the level of competition 
between the different instruments – and their 
providers – is likely to intensify further. Given 
the special economic framework applying in the field of payments and the extremely slow pace of change in users’ payment habits, no 
revolutionary changes are to be expected in the 
medium term, particularly in developed pay -
ments markets like Germany. In spite of global-
isation and the possibility that internationally active providers may gain in importance and 
exploit their strong market presence and finan-cial resources in order to expand and break into 
national markets, significant differences be -
tween individual global regions will nonethe -
less remain in the area of payment services.
The completion of the Single Euro Payments 
Area (SEPA) is of pivotal importance to the fu-ture evolution of the payments business in Ger -
many and Europe. Against this background, innovations are only going to succeed in the 
medium term if they are actually in use through-out Europe or their Europe-wide use is at least 
possible, for instance by means of common standards. Moreover, SEPA should be used to broaden the reach of innovative schemes, eg 
by setting up pan-European internet and mo -
bile payment procedures. Here, it would seem 
particularly advisable for the European banking 
industry to implement procedures for issuing 
e-mandates in connection with the new stand-
ardised SEPA Direct Debit Scheme; otherwise, it 
will not be possible to use the SEPA direct debit 
for internet payments with any guarantee of 
security. It is also evident that strategic policy decisions regarding European payment oper
-
ations and systems, especially the evolution of 
innovative payment instruments, will in future 
be taken in consultation with all the relevant 
user groups and policymakers in the form of a 
social dialogue. The banking industry should 
have a keen interest in actively helping to shape 
this process, bringing its expertise to bear in 
discussions and assuming key responsibility for the task of implementation.Single Euro

The International Monetary Fund 
in a changed global environment
The global monetary and financial system has undergone major changes since Germany first 
joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 60 years ago on 14 August 1952. The IMF has con-
tinuously adapted its policies in order to address the new challenges as they unfold and to enable it to perform its key systemic role of ensuring the smooth functioning of the international monet -
ary system. This is true of both its primary task of economic policy surveillance to prevent crises from emerging and the provision of balance of payments assistance when crises do occur. What has remained largely unchanged, however, is the IMF’s special structure as a fund and a monet -
ary institution, which sets it apart from other international financial institutions.
This financial structure is one of the Fund’s major strengths, as it does not have to draw on its 
member countries’ budgetary resources or tap the financial markets to fund its operations. How-ever, this set-up also imposes certain limits on the Fund’s policies and the financial assistance it can grant. It is these areas which have seen substantial changes since the turn of the millennium, 
especially on the heels of the global financial crisis and its fallout. These changes include a 
greater willingness to commit extensive financial resources, an across-the-board easing of the 
terms and conditions for borrowing from the Fund, and the restructuring of existing lending facil-ities and creation of new facilities in order to make them more attractive to potential borrowers. However, these measures also mean that the Fund is incurring higher risks on its own behalf and that of its creditors, and also entail an increasing danger of “moral hazard” and risks to the sta-bility of the international monetary and financial system.
By assuming excessive risk, the IMF would move away from its role as a liquidity mechanism and 
become more like a bank. Such a transformation, however, would contravene the legal and insti-tutional rules contained in the IMF Articles of Agreement and would also run counter to its finan-cing mechanism and its options for mitigating risk. The Fund’s willingness to increasingly expand risk protection and substitute private sector funding not only risks overstretching its institutional 
structure; it could also diminish the prospects for success of IMF-supported adjustment pro -
grammes.Deutsche Bundesbank

Changes in the IMF’s policies
When Germany joined the IMF 60 years ago on 
14 August 1952, the Fund itself was a young 
institution with only 54 member countries. 
Since then, not only has the number of mem -
bers risen considerably (to 188 at present), but 
there have also been major changes in the 
global monetary and financial system in which 
the IMF operates and whose functioning it is 
designed to support. These include changes in 
the global monetary system itself, such as the 
transition from the “Bretton Woods” system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates to a system 
of greater exchange rate flexibility, the strong 
expansion of trade and financial relationships between countries, growing interlinkages be
-
tween financial markets and the inception of European monetary union. In addition, the 
relative economic power of the IMF’s member countries has changed. Many developing coun-tries and emerging economies are now playing 
a greater role in the global economy and in international institutions and bodies such as 
the IMF and the G20. The IMF has also faced a 
number of financial market and debt crises in 
recent decades in an environment of more in -
tense global economic and financial relation -
ships; the crises in Latin America, Asia and, most recently, the United States and Europe 
have left, and are still leaving, their mark on the IMF.
In order to address these new challenges as they unfold, the IMF has been continuously adapting its policies and its financing capaci
-
ties. What has remained largely unchanged, however, is its special underlying set-up as a 
fund and a monetary institution – reflected, in 
particular, by the fact that member contribu -
tions to the IMF’s resources are posted as re -
serve assets. This sets the IMF apart from other 
international financial institutions such as the 
World Bank or the regional development banks. This financial set-up is one of the Fund’s major 
strengths, as it does not have to draw on its 
members’ budgetary resources or tap the fi -
nancial markets in order to fund its operations. However, this also imposes clear limits on the 
IMF’s policies and the financial assistance it can 
grant. It is these areas which have changed the 
most since the turn of the millennium, mark -
edly increasing risks to the IMF in both quanti-tative and qualitative terms.
This article will outline and assess the key changes to the IMF’s policies in recent times. 
These changes include
– an expansion of the IMF’s lending activities 
and changes to its risk profile,
– a substantial increase in the IMF’s financial 
resources,
– changes to the IMF’s governance and the 
growing importance of emerging economies 
and
– adjustments to economic policy surveillance 
as a result of lessons learnt from the finan -
cial crisis.
The article concludes by laying out ideas for the 
future role of the Fund which are consistent 
with its underlying set-up and mandate.
Expanded IMF lending 
 activities and changes  
in its risk profile
On the heels of the recent financial crisis, the 
IMF strongly expanded its role as a provider of 
financial assistance to support its member 
countries in their efforts to overcome the crisis 
and to help avoid contagion effects. The main aim of IMF financial assistance is to ensure that 
crisis-stricken countries do not resort to eco -
nomic and monetary policy measures that have 
a negative impact on others (eg competitive devaluation) and thus lead to instability and protectionism. The IMF therefore has an im
-
portant systemic function.60th anniversary

At the same time, the risks to the Fund associ-
ated with its financial assistance have also risen 
substantially in both qualitative and quantita -
tive terms. The increase in qualitative risk is par -
ticularly evident in the reduction in programme 
efficiency, ie a worsening of the ratio of eco -
nomic policy adjustment to IMF funding, as well as the Fund’s decision to largely forego economic policy adjustment requirements for 
newly created precautionary facilities. Looking 
at the quantitative dimension, the volume of IMF financial assistance has grown distinctly 
and concentration risk has also risen.
When assessing the risks to the IMF stemming 
from the financial assistance it provides, it is im-
portant to note that the Fund’s risk profile is not comparable with that of the credit port
-
folio of a commercial bank.1 The IMF differs 
from other financial institutions in a number of 
ways and, in its original capacity, is neither a 
credit institution nor an insurance mechanism 
in the private sector sense. It is funded by 
member contributions that can be held as re -
serve assets and acts as an intermediary for the 
exchange of currencies. This means that the IMF offers countries experiencing balance of 
payments problems freely usable currencies in 
exchange for their own, usually less well ac -
cepted currencies. The aim is to enable a coun-
try to offset liquidity shortfalls which manifest 
themselves in a temporary lack of external funding or gross reserve assets. Drawing on 
IMF financial resources is usually made condi -
tional on an adequate economic policy stabil -
isation programme and clear evidence of 
medium-term debt sustainability. The aim is to 
enable the country implementing the pro -
gramme to achieve a sustainable balance of payments position and thus obtain better ac
-
cess to funding in private capital markets, allowing it to repay the reserve assets to the 
Fund on schedule.
The IMF, moreover, does not charge the bor -
rowing country interest, in the usual sense of 
the word, for drawing on IMF financial re -
sources, instead levying a fee which is based on the SDR interest rate. The size of this fee de -
pends solely on the amount drawn and the 
timeframe of the arrangement. These fees are 
uniformly applied to all of the Fund’s borrowers 
and do not vary according to the borrowing 
country’s credit rating or risk. The rationale for 
this is that the Fund’s financial assistance is pro-vided only temporarily to offset liquidity short-falls and will therefore be repaid within a short space of time. There is no provision for assum-ing credit default risk.
The IMF has two special features that help to 
ensure that its loans are repaid. One is that it 
enjoys what is known as “preferred creditor 
status”. This status is not enshrined in law but 
is nonetheless recognised internationally. It 
means that the IMF’s repayment claims are se-nior to the claims of all other (foreign currency) 
creditors. The other is that the IMF is able to revolve the repayment obligations of pro
-
gramme countries almost indefinitely. Follow-up 
programmes entailing new funds which facili -
tate the repayment of due amounts are de -
signed to further strengthen a country’s cap -
acity to pay so that it can subsequently re-exchange the funds it has obtained from the 
IMF under its own steam. As the amounts due are, in a sense, serviced on time and the Fund’s financial assistance is not a loan, it is not neces-
sary – unlike with private creditors – to make 
any adjustments on the Fund’s balance sheet, 
such as write-downs on credit claims.
However, this conceptual elimination of credit 
risk for IMF loans does not mean that the IMF is free of financial risks. The IMF faces a specific kind of liquidity risk stemming from the revolv-
ing nature of the reserve assets provided by 
creditor countries combined with the possibility 
that debtor countries’ loans might have to be 
prolonged in order to avoid loan defaults. This 
means that, in connection with IMF financial assistance, “credit augmentation risk”, ie the Increase in both

risk that a follow-up programme might be ne-
cessary, takes the place of ordinary default risk. 
Such a prolongation, which might be needed 
multiple times, is not in line with the IMF’s mis-sion, which is to provide only short-term liquid-ity assistance.
In principle, the IMF combats such credit aug-
mentation risk by requiring that countries re -
ceiving assistance implement a sufficiently am-
bitious economic policy adjustment pro -
gramme. IMF financial resources can usually be drawn only in tranches, depending on the ful-
filment of previously agreed milestones in ad -
justment measures (also known as “condition -
ality”). Programme countries are expected to take all necessary measures to meet their re
-
payment obligations to the IMF on time. This 
underscores the particular importance of a pru-
dent lending policy and liquidity planning. However, should the IMF’s policies cause its risk to increase, member countries’ financing contributions could no longer be deemed 
highly liquid and low-risk. This would jeopard-ise their status as reserve assets and ultimately 
call into question the institutional framework 
for funding the IMF.
What this makes clear is that the initial effi -
ciency of the adjustment programmes has a 
decisive impact on the credit augmentation risk 
in IMF programmes. In this context, “pro -
gramme efficiency” is the ratio of a country’s lasting liquidity gains denominated in foreign 
currency – ie the improvement in its balance of payments – caused by economic policy adjust-ment to the size of its repayment obligations to the IMF. Put differently, it is the ratio of a coun-
try’s external adjustment to its access to IMF 
resources. The lower the programme efficiency, 
the lower the probability that the country will 
be able to meet its financial obligations to the Fund on time. This may ultimately threaten the IMF’s financial integrity.
To ensure sufficient programme efficiency, the 
IMF member countries have agreed on certain 
programme standards. These standards com -prise a compendium of preconditions and min-
imum requirements governing the use of the 
individual facilities and limits for maximum ac -
cess amounts and periods (see box on page 65). 
Changes in the international economic and 
political environment often lead to adjustments 
to the Fund’s toolkit and thus also its pro -
gramme standards. Particularly over the past few years, there has been a tendency to 
weaken the programme standards in order to 
simplify access to Fund resources and broaden 
the range of risks that can be covered by re -
course to Fund resources. In addition, the IMF 
has taken a more tolerant stance on access 
amounts, programme periods and repayment 
schedules, especially in its programmes for 
euro-area countries.
The design of IMF adjustment programmes has 
undergone various changes including, first and foremost, the reform of IMF financial assistance in 2009. Since the outbreak of the financial cri-sis in 2008, the IMF has begun to accept pro-grammes which are less ambitious with regard to the duration and substance of the economic 
policy adjustment process. In some cases, the 
IMF even tolerated the use of its financial re -
sources as a fiscal stimulus to domestic de -
mand.2
With regard to programme efficiency, such use of IMF financial resources is problematic. Last-
ing improvements to a country’s balance of 
payments are very difficult to achieve through 
fiscal stimuli. If the country is not implementing 
an accordingly ambitious adjustment pro -
gramme at the same time in order to structur -
ally improve its balance of payments position, 
there is a danger that IMF-funded economic 
policy measures will also promote domestic de-
mand for import goods, thereby supporting an 
unsustainable balance of payments trend – all 
the more so if the availability of external (mar -
ket-based) funding is overestimated. Experi -
ence has shown that, in most cases, foreign Adjustment

Provision of IMF fi  nancial assistance
The IMF‘s liquidity mechanism
Upon request, the IMF provides member 
countries experiencing balance of payments 
problems with the reserve assets they re-
quire via a currency exchange. If a member 
country requests that the IMF provide it, for 
example, with US dollars or euro because the country is unable or cannot afford to obtain them on the market, it purchases this hard currency from the IMF with the 
equivalent amount in its own currency. The 
IMF levies charges for committing or pro-viding such funds. When repayment of these reserve assets is due, the member country exchanges them for its own cur-rency – in other words, it uses reserve assets 
to repurchase the currency it had trans-
ferred to the IMF. In the intervening period, if the country‘s currency depreciates against 
the reserve assets it has acquired from the 
IMF, it must transfer more of its own cur-
rency to the IMF. This ensures that the IMF‘s 
holdings in the country‘s currency always 
match the value of the reserve assets it has 
provided to that country. Although the commonly used term “IMF loans” reason-ably describes the economic function of 
these transactions, they are, strictly speak-
ing, currency “purchases” and “repur-
chases”, and are designated as such by the IMF itself.

trade deficits can be reduced only over the 
longer term, whereas the private capital in -
flows necessary to fund them tend to be vola-
tile and can dry up quickly. This tends to in -
crease the threat of future balance of payments problems, which can run counter to the aim of 
IMF programmes: to bring about lasting im -
provements in the balance of payments pos -
ition.
In parallel to the changes in connection with programme design, the financing volume of 
the IMF programmes was expanded further; as part of the 2009 reform, the access limits were 
doubled to 200% of a member country’s quota
3 per year and 600% of quota cumula -
tively. How much a country may draw within these limits depends, in particular, on the ex
-
tent and urgency of the balance of payments 
need, the intensity of the country’s adjustment efforts and its capacity to repay. In exceptional 
cases, a specific procedure can be activated that also permits a country to draw funds in 
excess of these limits. This “Exceptional Access 
Framework” (EAF) was established in 2002. It may only be activated under four conditions: (1) the member country must be exposed to 
acute and exceptionally high capital outflows; 
(2) at the same time there must be a high prob-ability of debt sustainability; (3) the country has 
to be likely to regain access to the market within the time Fund resources are outstand
-
ing; and (4) the adjustment programme must 
have reasonably good prospects for success. In 
practice, however, these criteria were not al -
ways rigorously applied in the years following 
the EAF’s introduction, which undermined its 
credibility.
The EAF was reformed in 2009. As a result, ex-
ceptional access to IMF resources above the 
usual limits can now not only be granted in the 
event of acute, but also potential future bal -
ance of payments problems. On the heels of 
the recent programmes for euro-area coun -
tries, the EAF was modified once again. The 
IMF is now tolerating exceptional access to 
funds even for countries with a precarious debt situation and dim prospects for regaining mar -
ket access if those countries could be a poten-
tial source of substantial contagion effects or 
systemic risk to the international financial sys -
tem.
Identifying and quantifying such contagion ef-
fects and systemic risk, however, is difficult in 
specific cases and depends on the assumptions 
made. In view of the high risks caused by an 
already precarious debt situation, such cases 
would urgently require a thorough, convincing risk analysis based on clear and uniform bench-marks. However, as potential contagion effects 
and systemic risk are always fraught with un -
certainty, it is extremely difficult to provide such an analysis. At all events, it would be essential 
for the IMF to ensure that financial assistance 
from other creditors is available in case the debtor country ultimately becomes so over -
indebted that it cannot repay the funds it has 
obtained as assistance from the IMF.
There is another specific reason why higher 
lending volumes entail greater risk to the IMF. 
Its preferred creditor status is key to ensuring that the reserve assets which IMF members have contributed to the IMF remain risk-free. However, the Fund mainly achieves such risk 
mitigation through its preferred creditor status 
enabling it to pass on the default risks associ -
ated with its lending to the remaining external 
creditors. An IMF programme therefore has two mutually conflicting effects on private creditors’ expectations regarding the timely 
and full repayment of their cross-border loans. On the one hand, IMF-supported economic ad-
justment and favourable terms of financing

position and its future capacity to repay exter -… and not very

Preferred 
 creditor status can lead to crowding-out  effects
3 The quota denotes a member’s capital share. It is used to measure the country’s financial obligations to the IMF, the 
amount of funding it is entitled to access and its voting share. Moreover, during general allocations of special 
drawing rights (SDRs) the newly created SDRs are allocated to countries according to their quotas. The total amount of 
quota-related financial contributions by all member coun -
tries represents the “pool” of the IMF’s regular financial re-sources.Deutsche Bundesbank

nal liabilities. On the other hand, though, the 
IMF’s preferred creditor status can cause it to 
crowd out the claims of other creditors by in -
creasing the risks of these claims, which are 
junior to those of the Fund. This can have an 
adverse impact on graduation from IMF finan-
cial assistance, ie on the outlook for new finan-cial investment by private creditors.
The fundamental aim of any IMF programme is 
to strengthen investor confidence in a coun -
try’s external funding prospects through IMF-
supported economic policy adjustment. A very 
limited IMF share in the needed external finan-cing volume should thus tend to serve more as a catalyst than as a substitute for private capital 
flows (catalytic financing function). Otherwise, 
the aforementioned crowding-out effect may even worsen a country’s prospects for a suc
-
cessful return to the markets, thus reducing 
programme efficiency further. Such an effect is 
more likely the larger the IMF financial assis -
tance is relative to the debtor country’s overall 
funding need. A high volume of IMF financial 
assistance can therefore lessen a country’s 
chances of stabilising its external funding in the long term.
It can thus be stated that the latest changes in 
connection with the IMF’s programme stand -
ards and financing volumes provide grounds 
for concern that programme efficiency will fall. 
This can currently be inferred from the growing 
need for follow-up programmes (rising credit 
augmentation risk). In addition, the volumes of 
financial assistance have been exceptionally high, particularly in the more recent pro
-
grammes, which is why these adjustment pro-grammes have to achieve increasingly large ad-
justment gains in order for them to be suffi -
ciently efficient. Current experiences in some programme countries would appear to indi
-
cate, however, that the required adjustment 
gains cannot always be achieved in practice.
Most recently, the IMF toolkit was expanded by 
the creation of what are known as precaution-ary facilities, which are not tied to an economic adjustment programme. They are designed to 
enable countries to protect themselves from 
possible contagion. As some countries suffered liquidity shortfalls during the 2008 financial cri-sis which were deemed to be no fault of their own, the Fund decided to introduce a Flexible Credit Line (FCL) as a type of “insurance” facil-
ity. This line allows countries that do not have 
an acute balance of payments problem at the 
time of application to obtain – once the need 
arises – exceptionally large access to IMF finan-
cial resources immediately, ie without further approval and without any conditionality at
-
tached. Mexico, Poland and Colombia have 
been granted FCLs thus far but have not actu-ally drawn on them.
Along with the FCL, the principle of “ex-ante  
conditionality” was introduced, according to which the FCL is open only to countries with 
very strong economic fundamentals and a very 
good economic policy track record. The IMF 
therefore did away with the requirement of an 
adjustment programme for this instrument (“ex-post  conditionality”) in the event of IMF 
resources being accessed.
Soon after introducing the FCL, the Fund also 
created an additional precautionary facility to 
cover IMF member countries that do not fully 
qualify for the FCL. Originally established as the 
Precautionary Credit Line (PCL), which was a purely precautionary facility, it now enables countries to access liquidity immediately and 
has therefore been renamed the Precautionary 
and Liquidity Line (PLL). Unlike with the FCL, 
countries requesting a PLL are expected to im-
plement a certain degree of economic adjust -
ment, although the conditionality is not very 
strict; this adjustment is monitored for the first 
time six months after approval.
By introducing the FCL and PLL, the IMF has 
created a lending policy which involves high 
credit volumes and a partial or complete lack of 
conditionality. This combination may expose 
the IMF to high financial risks if these funds are 
actually drawn upon. It remains to be seen to Maintain cata-

what extent these IMF facilities can help to 
avoid contagion effects.
Looking back over several decades, the IMF has 
frequently lent large volumes of funds and has provided funds to several countries in the same 
region simultaneously. However, owing to the 
tendency towards larger and larger individual 
loans per borrower, a greater regional concen-
tration and the more frequent use of longer-
term IMF programmes, concentration risk has 
increased perceptibly in recent years. At present, one sole borrower already accounts 
for around 20% of all outstanding lending; the 
three largest loans make up 55%, and the five 
largest borrowers 74%, of all borrowing from 
the Fund. A larger volume and longer maturity 
of lending, as well as extensive additional funds 
committed under precautionary facilities, are using or tying up a good deal of the IMF’s available financial resources, placing a corres
-
ponding strain on its liquidity.
Substantial increase in  
IMF financial resources
Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis 
in 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis 
in 2010, the IMF has been more active than ever before, if its activities are measured in 
terms of the resources now available to it and 
the amount of financial assistance it has com -
mitted to its members. The Fund’s credit com-
mitments stood at somewhere in the tens of billions of SDRs between the outbreak of the 
Asian crisis in 1997-98 and 2004 before falling 
into the single-digit billions of SDRs in the 2005-07 period and then shooting up rapidly on account of the crisis. At last report, the funds committed under current financial ar
-
rangements amounted to around SDR 160 bil-lion (or around €190 billion).
To ensure that the Fund has the financial re -
sources it needs to fulfil its tasks, it was agreed 
in 2009 to augment the IMF’s resources by an 
exceptionally large amount.4 This affected both the Fund’s regular resources in the form of a 
doubling of its members’ quota subscriptions 
and also the “emergency reserves” in the form 
of multilateral credit lines from the countries 
with the strongest financial positions, which 
were increased tenfold. The multilateral credit 
lines are provided under the New Arrange -
ments to Borrow (NAB) by 40 countries or their central banks.
5 In addition, there are credit lines 
arranged bilaterally between the IMF and indi-
vidual creditor countries or their central banks. 
In 2009, bilateral credit lines served as a stop-
gap for providing any potential IMF assistance 
required before the expanded NAB entered 
into force. Owing to the above measures, the 
available IMF liquidity rose significantly to a  recent figure of around SDR 250 billion (or 
around €300 billion; see chart on page  70). 37  countries responded by mid-2012 to the 
IMF’s call for further temporary bilateral credit 
lines by pledging an additional US$456 billion 
(around €350 billion).6 These borrowing agree-
ments have not yet been implemented. The 
IMF will only be able to access these resources 
once the IMF resources already available from 
quota subscriptions and the NAB have fallen 
below an agreed threshold of SDR 100 billion.
Germany’s IMF Act conferred the financial 
rights and obligations stemming from Germa -
ny’s IMF membership upon the Bundesbank. 
On the basis of this mandate, the Bundesbank 
has provided Germany’s quota subscription to 
the IMF in the past decades. Once the quota increase has entered into effect, which is scheduled for autumn 2012, Germany’s IMF quota will rise from SDR 14.6 billion to SDR 
26.6 billion (or around €32 billion).
Moreover, the Bundesbank has contributed to 
all measures taken to strengthen the Fund’s 
emergency reserves. It provided the IMF with a 
€15 billion credit line in September 2009, and Higher concen-
tration risk

later augmented this amount to SDR 25.4 bil -
lion (around €30 billion) in accordance with its 
relative share as part of the increase in the 
multilateral NAB. When the IMF quota increase 
enters into force, contributions to the NAB will 
concurrently be reduced by around the same amount, which means that the Bundesbank’s 
share of the NAB will fall, as agreed, from SDR 25.4 billion to SDR 12.9 billion. Within the con-
text of the bilateral credit lines committed in 
2012, the Bundesbank will provide the IMF, if 
necessary, with up to €41.5 billion in additional funds. This will nearly double the total funding provided by the Bundesbank from its 2011 level to around SDR 74 billion (roughly €88 billion).The gulf that already exists between the size of 
regular quota-based funds and that of emer -
gency reserves initially grows when extensive 
credit lines are agreed. Taking the new bilateral 
credit commitments into account, emergency 
reserves are about three times the level of regu-lar quota-based funds. Once the quota increase enters into effect and the NAB funds have been 
partially reduced, the ratio will fall back down 
to about 1:1 (see above table). However, a quota-based institution would usually be ex
-

counted against the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). 3 The 2008 quota reform was designed to redistribute quota shares between 
member countries; it was implemented by means of selective quota increases. 4 The implementation of the committed bilateral credit 
lines of a total of US$250 billion to establish bilateral borrowing agreements was carried out individually for each creditor and completed 
in March 2011. 5 The bilateral borrowing agreements I served as a stopgap measure until the increase in the NAB resources came into 
effect and were then either discontinued or merged with NAB credit lines. 6 It is assumed here that the bilateral borrowing commitments will be implemented before the quota increase takes affect. 7 The implementation of the US$456 billion or approximately SDR 300 billion 
total in committed resources to establish bilateral agreements has not yet been completed. Due to the admission of an additional country 
to the NAB, they now comprise 40 participants with a volume of SDR 370 billion. 8 The doubling of quotas has not yet entered into force; 
the NAB volume will be reduced on account of the quota increase by SDR 188 billion, or about one-half.

shares and the subscriptions payable by all IMF 
member countries.
The increase in funding based on NAB re -
sources and bilateral credit lines is tending to 
weaken the close connection between funding 
and decision making in the IMF; these funds, 
provided by only 40 and 37 countries or central 
banks respectively, are not reflected in the countries’ voting shares within the IMF (see 
chart on page 71). However, it is of key import-ance to the Fund’s legitimacy that its members’ individual funding shares largely correspond to their voting shares.
Changes in the IMF’s 
 governance and the growing 
importance of emerging economies
The influence of the emerging economies on 
the IMF’s decisions has increased distinctly in the past few years. This trend is likely to con -
tinue for the foreseeable future. The quota in-crease adopted in November 2010 is scheduled to be implemented in autumn 2012, which will then expand the voting power of this group of countries to just under 45%.
7 China will super -
sede Germany as the third largest shareholder 
after the United States and Japan, and the four 
BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) 
will be among the ten IMF member countries 
with the largest voting shares (see table on 
page 72).
Moreover, the G20 and IMF are debating fur -
ther amendments to the quota formula in 
order to even better reflect members’ position 
in the global economy. Although this discus -
sion seems rather technical on the surface, it could have far-reaching political implications … weakens the

since the design of the quota formula impacts 
on quota shares and thus the financing and 
voting shares within the IMF. It is important 
that, when weighting the relevant factors, the 
quota formula takes due account of the IMF’s 
mandate to safeguard international payments. 
For all the criticisms that can be made of the 
current formula which has been in force since 
2008, it does constitute a considerable im -
provement on the system it replaced, which 
consisted of five complex formulas. The current formula is based on criteria of relevance to the 
IMF, it is simple and transparent, and it leads 
– as intended – to a quota increase for particu-
larly dynamic economies. These characteristics 
would need to be reflected in any new for -
mula, too. Following the next general quota 
review in January 2014, the greater economic 
might of the dynamic emerging economies is 
very likely to be reflected in higher quota shares 
for these countries, even if the quota formula 
itself remains unchanged.The IMF’s governing bodies, too, are reflecting the increased importance of the emerging and 
developing world. From October 2008 to 
March 2011, the IMF’s International Monetary 
and Financial Committee (IMFC) was chaired by 
the finance minister of a developing country 
(Egypt), who was then followed by the finance 
minister of a relatively young advanced Asian economy (Singapore). In July 2011, a Chinese citizen was appointed to the newly created post of an additional Deputy Managing Dir
-
ector.
Far-reaching changes to the IMF’s Executive 
Board have also been adopted. The members 
with the five largest quotas will no longer have the privilege of appointing their own Executive Director – including Germany, which has been 
in this group of countries since 1960. Under the new procedure, all 24 Executive Directors will be elected by the countries or groups of countries they represent. Whether or not a

it has “elected” itself or, as a member of a 
group of countries, by a jointly elected Execu -
tive Director depends mainly on that country’s 
IMF quota. Since the directors’ voting shares 
should be as equal as possible, countries with a 
relatively high quota, among them Germany, 
will not have to join a group. If, however, Ger -
many’s quota share were to fall substantially, 
this might possibly become necessary in the fu-
ture. Advanced European economies have de -
clared their willingness to consolidate their 
country groups and to cede two chairs on the 
Executive Board to the dynamic emerging and 
developing economies. Work on the concrete 
implementation of this commitment is still on-
going.
Moreover, the major emerging economies have 
also expanded their influence on the IMF 
through their G20 membership. In the past few 
years, the G20 has become established as a key 
body for cooperation on international eco -
nomic and monetary policy.8 At the meetings of G20 leaders and also of the G20 finance 
ministers and central bank governors, topics of relevance to the IMF are often on the agenda. 
In addition, issues relating to the architecture of the international financial system and to 
international economic policy dialogue are ad-dressed in G20 working groups on an ongoing 
basis. As the G20 members have a combined share of nearly two-thirds of voting power in 
the IMF, the G20 has a perceptible impact on 
discussions and decisions taken at the IMF.
Protecting the powers of the responsible IMF 
decision making bodies is key to preserving the 
legitimacy of Fund policy. Although the G20 
carries a great deal of political weight and, as a high-ranking informal group, may also provide political recommendations and joint statements on IMF policy issues, it represents only a small 
number of countries, whereas 188 countries – nearly all of the world’s states – are repre
-
sented in the IMF’s governing bodies (Executive 
Board, IMFC and Board of Governors). The le -
gitimacy of the IMF is based on international law, with formal decision making and imple
-
mentation powers codified in its Articles of 
Agreement. It is therefore crucial to ensure that 
all member countries are involved in decisions 
that impact on the IMF.
Using lessons learnt from  
the financial crisis to adapt economic policy surveillance
The 2008 financial crisis laid bare certain def -
icits in the IMF’s surveillance. A 2011 study by 
the Fund’s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) 
found that key global and national develop -
ments sometimes went unnoticed by the Fund, 
or were not communicated proactively enough, 
or were not sufficiently heeded by members, 
which meant that the risk of contagion was Perceptible

underestimated. In order to better recognise 
impending risks in future, the IEO calls, among 
other things, for a better integration of finan -
cial sector issues into macroeconomic assess -
ments and more consistent analyses and risk 
assessments. In addition, it concludes that the 
IMF should create an environment that, to a 
greater extent than before, considers dissent -
ing views and delivers clear messages, also and 
especially to the Fund’s decision making bod -
ies.9
The IMF has for some time been undertaking steps to enhance its surveillance. Since 2009, the IMF has been conducting “Early Warning Exercises” (EWEs) together with the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB) in order to identify, at an 
early stage, high-impact risks to the global economy; the findings are presented at the 
IMF’s Spring and Annual Meetings. The volun-
tary Financial Sector Assessment Program 
(FSAP) has now been made mandatory for the 
25 most important national financial sectors. Moreover, beginning in 2011 a “Spillover Re
-
port” has been prepared for five systemically 
important economies or economic areas (USA, 
Japan, China, United Kingdom and the euro area). This report studies the impact of these 
countries’ economic policies and developments 
on other countries and regions. The aim is to 
develop globally consistent policy options to 
reduce potential adverse spillovers. In addition, 
the IMF’s new “External Sector Report” is the first special report of its kind that specifically examines the risks to the external stability of 
the most important economies. The July 2012 
pilot External Sector Report also uses quantita-tive methods to assess the extent to which cur -
rent accounts and real exchange rates can be 
explained by fundamentals and whether cor -
rective policy actions may be needed. The re -
port also looks at international capital flows 
and changes in reserves. Moreover, the IMF as-
sists the G20 by contributing analyses to the “G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth”. This G20 “Mutual Assess
-
ment Process” (MAP), which is conducted as a 
peer review by the participating countries themselves, complements IMF surveillance and can promote a sense of “ownership” of the re-sultant recommendations.
In adopting the new “Decision on Bilateral and 
Multilateral Surveillance” in July 2012, the Ex -
ecutive Board has also amended the legal 
framework for its surveillance. This decision re-
vises the 2007 decision entitled “Bilateral Sur -
veillance over Members’ Policies” and is de -
signed to create a stronger focus on all policies 
– both external and internal – which could af-
fect balance of payments stability. It aims to better integrate bilateral and multilateral sur
-
veillance, to underscore the importance of multilateral surveillance for global economic and financial stability and to make countries more aware of the impact of their national economic policy on global financial stability. 
The explicit recognition that domestic stability 
– and national economic policies that are de -
signed to safeguard it – are of primary import-
ance to global stability is a welcome inclusion 
to the new surveillance decision. In contrast to the original intent, it is now clearly stated that no country can be obliged to subjugate its do-
mestic stability to the goal of global stability. The principle that “stability begins at home” 
has retained its central importance.
Conclusion
IMF policies have undergone far-reaching re -
forms, particularly in the context of the crisis 
management and resolution policies of recent 
years. While some of the measures have been 
beneficial, other reforms have increased the 
risks to the IMF. The Fund’s financing functions 
have been expanded and its credit conditions 
weakened; these reforms, in particular, have led to a deterioration in its risk profile. The 
largely risk-free nature of its lending and highly liquid nature of IMF resources, however, are es-sential elements of the Fund’s financial set-up. Measures

By assuming excessive risk, the IMF would 
move away from its role as a liquidity mechan-
ism and become more like a bank. Such a 
transformation, however, would contravene 
the legal and institutional rules contained in the IMF Articles of Agreement as well as its finan-
cing mechanism and its options for mitigating 
risk. The Fund’s willingness to increasingly ex -
pand risk protection and substitute private sec-
tor funding not only risks overstretching its in-
stitutional structure; it could also diminish the 
prospects for success of IMF-supported adjust-
ment programmes.
Since the financial resources of the IMF, too, 
are finite, the primary way in which it can en -sure its efficacy is by focusing its activities on its 
strengths, in keeping with its monetary man -
date. By concentrating on its primary surveil -
lance tasks and expertise in order to avert crises 
and through its catalytic financing role within 
efficient adjustment programmes to help coun-tries overcome temporary balance of payments 
problems, the Fund plays a crucial part in en -
suring international financial stability. The most 
important factor in the success of these meas-
ures, however, is – and will remain – adherence 
to the principle that each individual country 
bears primary responsibility for its own eco -
nomic growth and stability.Deutsche Bundesbank
