5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeGrowth in overall output in the second quar-
ter was the strongest it had been since early2001. Real gross domestic product (GDP) wasup by just under 1% on the average of theprevious quarter after adjustment for season-al and working-day variations compared with
3/C254% at the beginning of the year. Working-
day adjusted growth was up by just under2
1/C252% on the year. In particular, investment
contributed to stronger growth in the secondquarter. Real spending on buildings rose byjust over 4
1/C252% compared with the average
for the winter months when it had sunk by3% due to inclement weather. At 2
1/C252%, in-
vestment in machinery and equipment grewslightly more strongly than in the first quarter.By contrast, the positive development in pri-vate consumption at the beginning of theyear did not continue in the second quarter; itfell by just under
1/C252% on the quarter. Overall,
final domestic demand contributed just under
1/C252percentage point to growth. Positive
changes in inventories contributed1/C252per-
centage point to the increase in GDP . Exportsexpanded far less than in the precedingperiod. Nevertheless, they remained slightlystronger than imports, not least because ofspending by foreign visitors in connectionwith the FIFA World Cup. Overall, though, theexternal sector provided only a weak stimulus.
IndustryAt the beginning of the third quarter, indus-
trial business activity continued to move up-GDP in 2006

6wards. In July, seasonally and working-day
adjusted output increased by 11/C254%. The year-
on-year increase therefore went up to 51/C254%.
All major sectors, with the exception ofmanufacturers of basic metals, were able tostep up production; this held especially truefor manufacturers of motor vehicles, trailersand semi-trailers.
Buoyant industrial activity was also reflected
in the demand for industrial products. In sea-sonally and working-day adjusted terms, de-mand in July increased by 1
3/C254% on the figure
for June, which had been adjusted upwards.Nonetheless, the year-on-year increasedropped slightly to 7
1/C252%. Following practical-
ly no additional foreign demand in the firsthalf of the year, foreign business was the pri-mary source of growth in July. However, moretrade was also done with domestic custom-ers. Capital goods producers, in particular,profited from the stronger dynamics of de-mand.
In July, the seasonally adjusted value of ex-
ports of goods rose by 2
1/C254% on the month.
At the same time, nominal imports of goodswere 2
3/C254% up on their June level. Overall,
the trade surplus remained virtually un-changed. If the sharper price increases in im-ports are taken into consideration, however,the real trade surplus was up on the month.
ConstructionIn July, construction output expanded sharply:
it was 3
1/C252% up on June after adjustment for
seasonal and working-day variations. Theyear-on-year increase went up to 6
1/C254%.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Compared with the already considerably
higher second quarter average, the increasewas approximately 3% after adjustment forseasonal variations. Growth was achieved inthe general construction of buildings as wellas in civil engineering works.
Despite increasing noticeably in April and
May, new orders declined significantly in June(more recent statistical data are unavailable atpresent) compared with the previous month.The overall increase in the second quarterwas 5
1/C254% compared with the weak first
quarter which had been marred by inclementweather. The increase on the final quarter of2005, when normal weather conditions hadprevailed, was
3/C254%. In June, the pace slack-
ened perceptibly, above all in commercialorders, which had previously experiencedstrong growth. In residential construction,however, demand developed more favour-ably. Public sector orders also rose, especiallyin road construction.
Labour marketThe economic upswing in the labour market
continued. According to initial estimates bythe Federal Statistical Office, the number ofpersons in work rose to 39.08 million in July.This was 53,000 more than in June and310,000 more than 12 months previously.The Federal Employment Agency’s estimateof the number of employees subject to socialsecurity contributions, which was revised sig-nificantly upwards for May, was even higherin June according to initial calculations. Theoverall second quarter increase amounted to115,000 on the first quarter of 2006 and50,000 on the year. Although the number of
job vacancies officially registered in Augustwas unchanged from the previous month, itwas up by 155,000 on the year. The volumeof government-assisted forms of employmentbarely changed in July. The number of per-sons for whom labour market reallocationgrants were paid increased while the numbershort-time workers decreased.
According to Federal Employment Agency
figures, registered unemployment in August,at 4.45 million after adjustment for seasonalvariations, remained practically unchangedcompared with July, when it had droppedsharply. The year-on-year decrease was thus425,000. Persons leaving educational estab-lishments who subsequently register as un-employed generally do so in July. Unusually,more did so in August than in July this year;therefore, a certain distortion in the July fig-ure resulted in a weaker than usual decline inunemployment. The seasonally-adjusted un-employment rate remained at 10.6% as inthe previous month.
PricesPrices in the international energy markets re-
mained at a very high level in August. At justover US$74, the spot quotation for a barrel ofBrent North Sea oil in mid-August was onlyabout US$
1/C252lower than in July. Since late Au-
gust and early September, a further easinghas become apparent, however. At the timethis report went to press (14 September2006), the spot price stood at just underUS$64. However, mid-term (6-month) futurescontracts were quoted at US$3
1/C254above theOrders

8spot rate and long-term futures contracts
(18 months) were quoted at US$41/C254above
the spot rate, indicating that the market doesnot expect any further falls.
Price pressure on the upstream sectors of the
economy intensified in July. After adjustmentfor seasonal variations, import prices in-creased by 1.3% owing to marked rises inthe price of energy as well as metals andsemi-finished products. The year-on-year in-crease was 6.3%. Industrial producer priceswere up by 6.0% on the year. This pricesurge, too, was largely attributable to energyand intermediate goods.
In seasonally adjusted terms, consumer prices
remained unchanged in August. While foodprices went up quite sharply yet again, fuelprices fell. Package holidays also becamecheaper again. Year-on-year consumer priceinflation (CPI) declined by 0.2 percentagepoint to 1.7%. The HICP inflation rate stoodat 1.8%, compared with 2.1% in July.
Public finances
1
Statutory health insurance scheme
After a deficit of just over 31 billion in the
first quarter, the statutory health insurancescheme recorded a surplus of about the sameamount in the second quarter. Revenue fromcontributions was slightly more than 1% upon the year.
2While income subject to com-
pulsory insurance contributions (basic payroll)increased by almost 1
1/C252% in the case of em-
ployees, it stagnated for pensioners. At justover 3%, revenue grew far more sharply than
in the first three months of the year, mainlydue to the receipt of the first half of the Fed-eral grant, which had increased from 32.5 bil-
lion to 34.2 billion in total.
At 2
1/C252%, expenditure increased at a much
slower pace than in the first quarter (+41/C252%).
Spending on pharmaceuticals was up only
1/C252% on the year (after a previous increase of
just over 10%). Spending on hospitals in-creased by just over 3%, however, this wasslower than in the previous year (5
1/C252%). Ex-
penditure on sickness benefit was againlower. However, expenditure on dental treat-ment and dentures, in particular, increasedsignificantly (+9
1/C252%). This shows a clear turn-
around following the sharp decline in thistype of expenditure at the beginning of 2005owing to the changeover to diagnosis-relatedfixed subsidies for dentures.
As can be seen, the unfavourable financial re-
sults for the first quarter could not be mech-anically extrapolated for the entire year. Inparticular, federal resources, which were con-siderably higher, contributed to an improve-ment in results in the second quarter. In add-
1In the short report on public finances which regularly
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly Monthly Reports (published in
February, May, August and November), by contrast, con-
tain a detailed description of general government budget
trends during the preceding quarter. For detailed statistic-
al data on budgetary developments and public debt, see
the statistical section of this report.
2In contrast to what happens in the statutory pension in-
surance scheme and the Federal Employment Agency,
contribution receipts are recorded on an accruals basis in
the statutory health insurance scheme. Consequently, the
new rule stipulating the earlier transfer of social security
contributions by employers, which came into force at the
start of 2006, does not have a revenue-boosting effect
here.Industrial

9ition, the subdued growth in spending on
pharmaceuticals – partly induced by the “Actimproving cost-efficiency in pharmaceuticalssupply” (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der
Wirtschaftlichkeit in der Arzneimittelversor-gung) that came into force on 1 May – and
the comparatively favourable revenue fromcontributions also played a part. Neverthe-less, a large number of health insurancefunds will still record considerable debts atthe end of the year which, under current law,will have to be eliminated by the end of 2007.
In the coming year, the cut in the Federal
grant of 32.7 billion to 31.5 billion as well as
additional expenditure as a result of the VATincrease (almost 31 billion) alone mean that
the average contribution rate has to increaseby almost 0.4 percentage point. This, alongwith the probable increase in the contributionrate to the statutory pension insurancescheme, will partially compensate for the cutin the contribution rate to the Federal Em-ployment Agency.
Long-term care insurance schemeThe long-term care insurance scheme record-
ed a surplus of almost 3
1/C254billion again for
the second quarter of 2006. Expenditure onbenefits was not higher than during the sameperiod of the previous year and this eased thefinancial burden. Only expenditure on nursinghome care increased, namely by almost 2%.By contrast, expenditure on out-patient careand benefits in cash declined.
As in the first quarter, the significant financial
improvement on the previous year is mainlydue to additional revenue resulting from
bringing forward the transfer deadline for so-cial security contributions. Since January,employers have had to transfer the socialsecurity contributions on wages and salariespaid at month-end in the same month. There-fore, in January 2006, contributions were re-ceived for December and for January in manycases. However, an exemption provision gaveemployers the opportunity to transfer thecontributions for January equally over the fol-lowing six months, which meant that theone-off additional revenue was spread overthe months up to and including July. Both inthe final annual accounts (financial statistics)of the long-term health insurance schemeand in the national accounts, the contribu-tions are recorded on an accruals basis, ie inthe months in which they were generated.

10stead of a surplus of almost 31/C252billion, these
accounts will probably record a slight deficitfor the first half of the year in the annual re-sult. Overall, however, the long-term care in-surance scheme is also benefiting from amore favourable development in the contri-bution base this year. However, even if themoderate growth in expenditure continues,the final results for the year are not likely to bemuch more favourable than in the previousyear after adjustment for the one-off effect.
Securities markets
Bond marketIn July, domestic borrowers issued debt secur-
ities in the German bond market to a value of381.5 billion, compared with 389.4 billion in
June. Owing to lower redemptions and aftertaking due account of changes in issuers’holdings of their own bonds and notes, netsales amounted to 318.6 billion, representing
a significant gain on the previous month’s fig-ure where the volume of domestic bonds out-standing had gone down by 36.7 billion. In
July, net sales of foreign debt securitiesamounted to 35.5 billion, bringing the total
amount of funds raised in the bond market to324.1 billion.
General government was the main issuer
among domestic borrowers, adding 323.5
billion to its bonded debt. Central govern-ment accounted for 322.9 billion of this
amount, issuing the bulk of these funds asten-year and thirty-year Federal bonds worth311.3 billion and 33.8 billion respectively. In
the shorter-term maturity segment, it issuedtwo-year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze)worth 35.4 billion, Treasury discount paper
(Bubills) to the value of 30.7 billion and
Federal Treasury financing paper for 30.2 bil-
lion. Five-year Federal notes (Bobls) were soldfor31.5 billion net. State governments bor-
rowed 30.6 billion on the bond market in
July.
In July 2006, credit institutions redeemed
their own securities in the amount of 31.5 bil-
lion after issuing bank debt securities for 34.7
billion net in the previous month. This de-crease was, on balance, largely attributableto net redemptions of public Pfandbriefe(–31.9 billion), the outstanding volume of
which has tended to decline in the past fewyears. In July 2006, the volume of mortgageQuarterly

11Pfandbriefe and of debt securities of special-
ised credit institutions also decreased, by 30.4
billion and 30.2 billion respectively. Other
bank debt securities, which can be structuredespecially flexibly, were the only bank debtsecurities to be issued in July, at a net value of31.0 billion. Their share of total bank debt
securities issuance has increased from 33%to 43% over the past five years.
Corporate bonds and commercial paper were
redeemed on balance. The volume of suchpaper fell by a further 33.4 billion in July,
having already dropped by 32.5 billion in the
previous month.
Non-residents accounted for the majority of
debt security acquisitions ( 317.0 billion), for
the most part purchasing public sector paper(312.8 billion). Domestic non-banks increased
their holdings of German public debt secur-ities by 310.1 billion and purchased foreign
bonds to the amount of 32.7 billion. At the
same time, they sold private sector paperworth 34.7 billion. Domestic credit institu-
tions removed 33.7 billion worth of German
bonds from their portfolios, while addingdebt securities issued by non-residentsamounting to 32.8 billion.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
picked up in July. At 32.0 billion, the market
value of the issues exceeded the previousmonth’s figure of 30.4 billion. However, this
shift can be attributed mainly to the capitalincrease of one enterprise. The stocks of for-eign equities held by residents were depletedby37.0 billion. Credit institutions and foreign
investors sold shares worth 37.3 billion and
34.0 billion respectively. Only non-banks pur-
chased equities on balance ( 36.3 billion).
They purchased domestic securities for 310.7
billion and disposed of foreign paper in theamount of 34.4 billion.
Mutual fund sharesThe volume of domestic mutual fund shares
went down by 30.1 billion. While, above all,
specialised funds reserved for institutional in-vestors recorded inflows of new cash ( 30.5
billion), investment funds open to the generalpublic suffered outflows of funds amountingto30.6 billion. This came from investors with-

Open-end real estate funds ( 30.1 billion) and

marginally positive net inflow of resources.The volume of foreign mutual fund shareswas down by 30.1 billion.
Resident credit institutions invested 30.5 bil-
lion in mutual fund shares. Foreign investorsput 30.4 billion into domestic mutual fund
shares in July. By contrast, domestic non-banks sold domestic mutual fund shares for30.9 billion and purchased 30.1 billion worth
of foreign certificates on balance.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus –
in unadjusted terms – of 37.3 billion in July,
compared with one of 310.7 billion a month
earlier. The main reason for this fall was thegreater deficit in the area of invisible currenttransactions. These comprise services, incomeand current transfers. Another contributoryfactor was the slight decline in the trade sur-plus.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus fell from 313.4 billion in June to 313.1
billion in July. After adjustment for seasonaland working-day variations, the balance re-mained unchanged at 312 billion. At 2
3/C254%,
month-on-month growth in imports of goodswas somewhat stronger than the growth in
exports of goods (21/C254%); in terms of value,
however, it was significantly less. In theperiod from April to July, seasonally ad-justed exports were on average 1
3/C254%
above the level of the first quarter of 2006,a development which was due mainly toprice increases. Nominal imports increasedjust as strongly as exports in this periodalthough they slightly decreased in realterms.
In July, the deficit on invisible current transac-
tions rose by 33.2 billion on the month to
34.0 billion. This was due to a deterioration in
all three sub-accounts. The deficits on ser-vices and current transfers both increased by31.1 billion to 32.5 billion and 32.6 billion
respectively. At 31.1 billion, the net cross-
border income was only about half as muchas in June ( 32.1 billion).
Cross-border portfolio transactions resulted in
net capital imports of 319.2 billion in July,
compared with 310.6 billion in June. As in
the previous month, foreign investment inGerman securities was quite strong ( 317.9
billion, compared with 328.3 billion). The em-
phasis was on the acquisition of domesticdebt securities ( 317.0 billion), which was due
solely to the acquisition of bonds and notes(318.5 billion). The focus here was on paper
issued by general government ( 312.4 billion).
By contrast, German portfolio investors re-duced their net cross-border investment by31.4 billion in July. In particular, they sold
shares ( 37.1 billion) but bought debt secur-
ities in return ( 35.5 billion).Purchases of

13Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports of 39.2 billion in July, compared with
34.7 billion a month earlier. This was signifi-
cantly influenced by two individual transac-tions undertaken by domestic market players.In the case of German direct investmentabroad there was a major loan repayment infavour of a non-resident subsidiary, whereasin the case of foreign direct investment inGermany a German direct investment enter-prise bought back some of its own sharesfrom a foreign investor. On balance, Germandirect investment abroad resulted in capitalexports of 34.6 billion, while foreign direct
investment in Germany resulted in capitalexports of 34.7 billion.
Other investment, which comprises loans and
trade credits as well as bank deposits andother assets, resulted in net capital exportsof33.8 billion in July (compared with 336.9
billion in June). Enterprises and individualsrecorded inflows of funds amounting to 35.9
billion, mainly drawing on their bank depositsabroad. The activities of general governmentresulted in inflows of funds amounting to32.4 billion. By contrast, the Bundesbank
recorded increases in claims amounting to310.4 billion net. These were mainly attribut-
able to transactions in connection with thelarge-value payment system TARGET. In theunsecuritised financial transactions of Ger-man credit institutions, there were net out-flows of 31.8 billion.

15The performance
of German credit
institutions in 2005The recovery in German banks’ per-
formance continued in 2005. Evenmore than in 2004, however, profitgrowth was concentrated on individ-ual categories of banks and the bigbanks in particular. While the improve-ments in 2004 derived mainly from thecost side, there were supporting fac-tors on both sides of the profit and lossaccount in the year under review. Onthe cost side, there was a further de-cline in risk provisioning, while admin-istrative spending was again on the in-crease. On the income side, profitgrowth in interest business remainedsubdued. By contrast, substantial in-creases were achieved in net commis-sions received and particularly in own-account trading, which was, however,partly influenced by exceptional ef-fects.
The published individual accounts
drawn up in accordance with the Ger-man Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch) indicate a marked increase in the
operating result of German credit insti-tutions. Owing to the declining burdenfrom the balance of the “extraordinaryaccount”, the profit for the financialyear before tax grew even more strong-ly, in fact. Even after tax, profit growthwas substantial. Finally, it was notablethat, unlike in previous years, Germanbanks built up sizeable reserves in 2005.For the current financial year, a stabil-isation in the level of income achievedhas been emerging so far.

16Income from interest business
After significantly adjusting their balance
sheets and reducing their risk assets in previ-ous years, German banks increased theirstocks of risk assets again somewhat in 2005.Owing to the higher remuneration of theseriskier assets, the net interest received by Ger-man credit institutions, at 388.2 billion, was
33.2 billion up on the year. Nevertheless, theshare of net interest received in income from
overall operating business – which combinesnet interest and net commissions received, in-come from own-account trading, and netother operating income or charges – fell to68.3%. This was due primarily to the signifi-cantly sharper increase in the net profit on fi-nancial operations.
1The interest margin – net
interest received in relation to banks’ balancesheet total – also narrowed to 1.17% as theslight rise in net interest received was morethan offset by a somewhat sharper expansionof the balance sheet total. The same also ap-plies to the balance sheet total adjusted forinterbank business. In this context, the inter-est margin likewise narrowed to 1.62%,compared with 1.63% in 2004.
As in 2004, an analysis of the result from
interest business by category of banks showsthat the increase was generated largely bycommercial banks. Among the commercialbanks, the big banks again managed toachieve a sharp increase in their net interestreceived to 319.4 billion after already record-
ing a very positive result in the previous year(317.3 billion). This was due primarily to the
increase in interest received from lending andmoney market transactions. The expansion ofinterbank business, mainly with foreignbanks, is likely to be have been the main rea-son for this. Furthermore, there was an in-crease in big banks’ earnings arising fromDM bn € bn

1When interpreting this figure – and, incidentally, all
other data involving the net profit from financial oper-
ations – it should be noted that, partly owing to an in-
creased fair-value measurement of trading positions, the
trading result of the German banks for 2005 is compar-
able only to a very limited extent with the previous years’
figures. This affected the big banks and the Landesban-
ken in particular.Subdued

17their markedly higher securitised lending, es-
pecially to non-residents. Owing to the posi-tive interest rate result, the big banks’ interestmargin went up to 1.00%. Besides the bigbanks, it was mainly the regional banks thatnoticeably improved their interest rate result,their interest margin increasing by 0.12 per-centage point to 2.17%. The recordedgrowth was, however, due, first and fore-most, to a sharp rise in individual credit insti-tutions’ profits transferred under profit pool-ing and profit transfer agreements and notthe result of a general expansion of lendingbusiness.
By contrast, in the case of savings banks
there was a slight narrowing of the interestmargin. This fell by 0.05 percentage point to2.30% – a decline which was reinforced bythe slight expansion of the balance sheettotal. This is particularly notable as the shareof net interest received in operating income,at 79.0%, is greater for savings banks thanfor all other categories of banks. Net interestreceived remained almost unchanged in thecase of credit cooperatives, with its share ofoperating income falling slightly to 74.7%.Nevertheless, owing to the slight increase inthe balance sheet total, the interest marginfor this category of banks likewise wentdown, to 2.46%, during the reporting period.In the case of Landesbanken and regional in-stitutions of credit cooperatives, which struc-turally have quite a small interest margin any-way owing to their focus on wholesale andinterbank business, the margin fell slightlyfrom 0.65% to 0.63% and from 0.49% to0.47% respectively.Interest received by credit

18Net commissions received
Net commissions received by German credit
institutions rose by 10.0% during the periodunder review and, at 327.8 billion, attained a
level comparable to that of the record year2000. In relation to the balance sheet total,which likewise showed an overall increase,net commissions received went up by 0.02percentage point to 0.37%. The sharp rise inshare turnover and the greater number ofIPOs primarily contributed to this develop-ment. Compared with 2000, however, netcommissions received as a ratio of the bal-ance sheet total failed to match the import-ance this item had for the German bankingindustry during the stock market boom.Broken down by category of banks, it was
mainly commercial banks, which already gen-erate well over half of net commissions re-ceived by German banks as a whole, whichrecorded a marked growth in their commis-sions result. In the case of big banks, this lineof business has accounted for just under one-third of operating income on an average ofthe past ten years, and in 2005 they increasedtheir net commissions received by 14% to310.1 billion. This was due to quite a marked
rise in commissions received combined with asimultaneous reduction in commissions paid.The regional banks and other commercialbanks, too, clearly improved their result inthis area. Credit cooperatives also recordedan increase, whereas net commissionsreceived by savings banks remained nearlyunchanged after a successful 2004.As a percentage of the average balance sheet total 1

19Net profit or net loss on
financial operations
Following the quite sharp decline in 2004,
the German credit institutions improved theirtrading result considerably in 2005, not leastas a result of the recovery in the financialmarkets. In addition, there was also an excep-tional effect in connection with the increasedfair-value measurement of trading positionsin some cases. The sharp rise of 310.2 billion
to311.4 billion in the net profit on financial
operations was confined mainly to the bigbanks and – as the published individual ac-counts show – to no more than a small num-ber of institutions within this category ofbanks. Not only the big banks, but alsoothers, notably the credit cooperatives, in-creased their profits from own-account trad-ing. In addition, the savings banks recorded
perceptible growth in this line of business,whereas the net result from financial oper-ations posed a strain on the regional banks’net result for the year. However, own-accounttrading is of comparatively minor importancefor those institutions primarily active in retailbanking.
Administrative spending
Across all credit institutions, administrative
spending in 2005 showed a slight increase forthe first time in three years. It rose by 33.0 bil-
lion to 378.8 billion. Staff costs, which still ac-
count for just over half of general administra-tive spending, went up by 32.2 billion to
343.4 billion in the reporting period, evenPerformance of the various categories of banks in 2004/2005*

20though the number of persons employed in
the banking industry fell by 6,300 to 672,500in the reporting year. As well as wage and sal-ary increases, the increase in expenditure onretirement pensions as a result of the changein the calculation method is likely to havebeen the reason for this. Total other adminis-trative spending, which essentially comprisesoperating expenditure, expenditure on third-party services, and write-offs and write-downs of tangible fixed assets, was also upslightly in the financial year 2005. In this area,greater savings had been possible in 2004.During the period under review, general ad-ministrative spending as a ratio of the like-wise slightly higher balance sheet total wasstagnating at 1.05%.As a mirror image of the income side, here,
too, it was primarily the commercial bankswhose general administrative spendingshowed a marked increase in the year underreview. Staff costs went up by 31.3 billion, or
8.9%, for these institutions, despite the con-tinued reduction in staff levels by 1,850 em-ployees. Especially in the case of the bigbanks, this is likely to be the result of per-formance-related salary components as wellas the negotiated pay rise and increasingspending on retirement pensions. Other ad-ministrative spending also went up somewhatfor the category of commercial banks, too.
The increase in general administrative spend-
ing was not quite as marked in the case ofcredit cooperatives and savings banks, forwhich the share of administrative spending inthe business volume plays a more significantrole than for commercial banks. The Landes-banken also recorded a slight increase in theirgeneral administrative spending. Despite arise in the number of employees, however,this was still below the average for the Ger-man credit institutions as a whole. Amongthe categories of banks considered here, onlythe regional institutions of credit cooperativesmanaged to reduce their general administra-tive costs slightly by making considerable sav-ings in other administrative spending.

21was due mainly to the sharp rise in other op-
erating charges along with a slight decline inincome.
Big banks, in particular, were unable to match
the positive result of the previous two yearsand, owing to the perceptible decline in otherincome along with a sudden sharp rise inother charges, they recorded a negative bal-ance of - 30.8 billion. There were very hetero-
geneous reasons for this development amongthe affected credit institutions, however. Fur-thermore, net other operating income orcharges did not contribute as strongly as be-fore to the profit of the Landesbanken andthe regional institutions of credit coopera-tives, whereas it remained virtually un-changed in the case of the credit coopera-tives. It was only the regional banks and sav-ings banks which showed an increase in this
item.
Operating result before the valuation
of assets
Besides the slight improvement in the partial
operating result in 2005, which ensued fromthe increase in net interest and net commis-sions received less the slight increase in gen-eral administrative spending, there was amarked growth in the net profit on financialoperations. Both of these developments to-gether easily outweighed the decline in netother operating income or charges. Conse-quently, the operating result before the valu-ation of assets increased by 310.5 billion to

22ment in the operating result before the valu-
ation of assets was primarily attributable tothe big banks and their trading result. Fornearly all other categories of banks, the oper-ating result before the valuation of assetsdeteriorated slightly in the reporting year.
This meant that, on balance, domestic banks –
as in previous years – were able to reducetheir cost/income ratio in the broader sense –which is defined as the ratio of administrativespending to the sum of net interest and netcommissions received, net profit or net losson financial operations, and net other operat-ing income or charges. With a reduction of4.5 percentage points, there was, in fact,again a substantial improvement on the yearin 2005. Similarly, in relation to gross income– the sum of net interest and net commis-sions received – the cost/income ratio in thenarrower sense improved slightly by 0.8 per-centage point. However, for both measuresof cost efficiency, it was the big banks, in par-ticular, as well as regional banks and regionalinstitutions of credit cooperatives that wereable to achieve a significant reduction in thisarea. For Landesbanken and savings banks,as well as for credit cooperatives, the cost/in-come ratio increased slightly according toboth measures, however.

the fund for general banking risks (pursuantto section 340 (g) of the German CommercialCode) in 2005. However, in the performanceanalysis presented here, this amount is allo-cated to the appropriation of profit (accumu-lation of reserves) and is not reflected in a

24Deutsche BundesbankThe performance of direct banks in Germany
In recent years, Germany has seen an increase in the sig-
niﬁ cance of a new type of bank – the direct bank – which 
does not principally sell its banking services through branches but rather, mainly, via the internet (direct 
banking). The business development of these banks was 
outlined in the May 2006 Monthly Report. This box now 
gives an overview of the banks’ performance in the past 
few years based on their published individual accounts drawn up in accordance with the German Commercial 
Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) .
1
The performance of German direct banks is closely 
linked to the (re)orientation of their business model: 
for instance, the share of net interest received in total operating income rose from 49% in 2000 to 80% in 2005. 
At the same time, the share of net commissions received – which in 2000 contributed to operating income on 
roughly the same scale as interest business (49%) – fell to 18% by the end of the period under review. This reﬂ  ects 
the marked growth in German direct banks’ on-bal-
ance-sheet business, which was stepped up by the banks 
analysed here in the wake of the developments on the stock markets in 2001.
Speciﬁ  cally, the German direct banks’ interest margin 
was noticeably higher than that of the banking industry 
as a whole throughout the observation period from 
2000 to 2005. In this regard, the direct banks’ ratio of

25interest income to the balance sheet total differs only 
marginally from that of all German banks, while their interest expenditure is signiﬁ  cantly lower than the 
average level for all institutions. Although a number 
of the direct banks under consideration here pay inter-
est rates which are noticeably higher than the market 
rates for some types of deposits, the fact that these are 
mainly short-term and thus comparatively modestly remunerated deposits is likely to be of signiﬁ  cance. At 
the start of the observation period, the direct banks’ net 
commissions received were still distinctly higher in rela-tion to the balance sheet total than the ﬁ  gure reported 
for all German banks. In the wake of the stock market 
developments in 2001, there was a sharp decline in the contribution to income from this business line, which was attributable almost entirely to losses in income. By contrast, the direct banks managed to reduce their 
relevant expenditure only gradually. The net commis-
sions received by direct banks have now reached a level similar to the average for all German banks, although 
both income and expenditure – measured in relation to 
the balance sheet total – are higher in the case of the 
direct banks.
In the past ﬁ  ve years, the direct banks have managed to 
reduce their (initially signiﬁ  cantly higher) general admin-
istrative spending in relation to their (strongly increased) balance sheet total. Such spending has gone down to a 
level which is only slightly higher than the average for 
German credit institutions as a whole. This decline has affected not only staff costs but also, ﬁ  rst and foremost, 
other administrative spending. In the years up to 2002, 
the latter was far higher than the corresponding ﬁ  gures 
for all banks. Apart from the equipment – above all, IT – costs associated with setting up new banks, marketing costs are also likely to have played a major role to begin with. As in previous years, the direct banks were again able to reduce their net expenditure in relation to earn-
ings from operating business in the ﬁ  nancial year 2005. 
Nevertheless, at the end of the period under review, their cost/income ratio was still 63.8% compared with the average of 61.0% for all German banks.
In summary, the direct banks’ partial operating result 
(net interest received plus net commissions received less general administrative spending) shows that they were 
much more affected by the stock market developments 
in 2001 than the German banking industry as a whole. At present, however, their partial operating result is again 
higher than the average for all banks. The direct banks’ 
operating result presents a similar development.

26credit cooperatives (0.52%) and regional and
other commercial banks (0.38%) – ie thoseinstitutions which are primarily engaged in re-tail banking – recorded comparatively highnet charges from the valuation of assets. Bycontrast, the corresponding figures of thosebanks primarily engaged in wholesale bank-ing showed a perceptibly lower level. In rela-tion to the average balance sheet total, thebig banks, regional institutions of credit co-operatives and Landesbanken allocated0.09%, 0.08% and 0.05% respectively totheir risk provisioning. They therefore clearlyundershot the long-term average calculatedfor the years prior to 2002.
At32.2 billion, write-downs on fixed-interest
securities, which are partly recorded underthe net income or net charges from the valu-ation of assets, were clearly up on the 2004
figure of 30.6 billion. Apart from this, it is
likely that the German banking industry’s riskprovisioning derived largely from domesticlending business in 2005, too. As in the previ-ous year, German banks encountered a de-clining number of corporate insolvencies; thefigure fell by 6% to just under 37,000.
3At
the same time, however, there was an in-crease of 40
1/C252% in the number of consumer
insolvencies to just under 69,000. Neverthe-less, since there was a continuation of thetrend towards a lower loss per case of bothcorporate and customer insolvency – a devel-opment that had already become apparent inprevious years – the level of receivables af-fected was 8% down on the year, despite theoverall increase in the number of insolvenciesin Germany. This meant that banks’ profitabil-ity was much less affected by insolvenciesthan in 2004.
Supported by the declining burden of risk
provisions, the operating result of the Ger-man banking industry as a whole improvedby313.7 billion to 336.3 billion in the year
under review. The category of big banks,which benefited from the marked improve-ment in the trading result, accounted for byfar the greatest part of the increase. Regionalbanks, savings banks and regional institutionsof credit cooperatives also improved their op-erating result. By contrast, credit cooperativesrecorded a slight fall and the Landesbanken alarger decline in their operating result.DM bn € bn

27Other and extraordinary income
or charges
The balance of other and extraordinary in-
come or charges was again negative, but, inthe year under review, showed a noticeableimprovement from - 312.3 billion in 2004 to
-33.1 billion. This development was, however,
confined to only a few categories of banks.Firstly, these were those groups of institutionswhose “extraordinary account” had beenhaving a particularly negative impact in thepast few years. The balance of the “extraor-dinary account” at big banks (+ 31.0 billion)
bolstered the earnings situation again for thefirst time since 2001, with the published indi-vidual accounts showing that some of the in-stitutions in this category earned considerableincome from sales of participating interests.In the case of the Landesbanken, which, in
2004, were still having to cope with the re-payment obligations resulting from the EU in-vestigations into the granting of state aid,there was a marked reduction in the negativebalance of the “extraordinary account”(-31.1 billion, compared with - 34.5 billion in
the previous year), even though this item wasstill in deficit. Secondly, the credit coopera-tives – for which this item does not, typically,play a major role – achieved a considerablenet profit (+ 31.4 billion) in connection with
the transfer of shareholdings to a holdingcompany. By contrast, the balance of the“extraordinary account” changed very littlefor the other categories of banks under con-sideration here.Breakdown of other and extraordinary income or charges*

28Specifically, the result from German banks’ fi-
nancial investment business, at + 34.3 billion
during the reporting year, made a significantpositive contribution to the “extraordinary ac-count” for the first time since the sharp fall in2003. For those institutions which showednet charges from value adjustments in respectof participating interests, shares in affiliatedenterprises, and securities treated as fixedassets, these halved to 30.7 billion. The sharp
increase in net income recorded by the otherbanks to 35.0 billion, compared with 31.1 bil-
lion in the previous year, had a similar effect.
4
In 2005, this positive development in financialinvestment business was accompanied by animprovement in net extraordinary incomeand charges in the narrower sense (- 31.4 bil-
lion, compared with - 37.2 billion in the previ-
ous year), which had been largely affected bythe EU investigations into the granting of
state aid in 2004. Furthermore, net incomefrom the release of special reserves went upslightly to 346 million in 2005, compared
with 312 million in 2004. All in all, these com-
ponents did not, however, fully offset theother extraordinary sub-items, which typicallyshow a negative balance. Thus, loss transferstotalled - 31.3 billion in 2005 (compared with
-30.9 billion in 2004) and profits had a great-
er overall impact than in the previous year;34.7 billion compared with 33.9 billion.Return on capital of individual categories of banks*

29Profit for the financial year, taxes on
income and earnings
Given the considerably weaker adverse im-
pact of the “extraordinary account”, the Ger-man banking industry’s recorded profit forthe year before tax rose considerably in the fi-nancial year 2005 to 333.2 billion, compared
with 310.4 billion in 2004 and 31.8 billion in
2003. This increase was therefore significantlylarger than the increase in the operating re-sult. Looking at the individual banking cat-egories, it was again the institutions whichhad had to cope with a very marked deterior-ation in profitability over the past few yearswhich recorded substantial profit increasesfor the financial year before tax, ie the bigbanks ( 314.9 billion, compared with - 32.1 bil-
lion in 2004) and the Landesbanken ( 33.0 bil-
lion, compared with 30.5 billion). Owing to
the balance of the “extraordinary account”,credit cooperatives also achieved a percep-tibly higher increase in their net profit for theyear before tax. Most of the other categoriesof banks under consideration in this articlealso increased their pre-tax profit in the yearunder review. Mortgage banks were the onlycategory of banks to record a drop in profitfor 2005 (by 30.4 billion to 30.2 billion).
Thus, all of the categories of banks con-sidered here recorded a positive pre-tax resultfor the first time again.
In line with this, the German banking indus-
try’s average return on equity before tax wentup to 12.68% in 2005, compared with4.19% in 2004 and 0.72% in 2003. It there-fore exceeded the average level of the period1997-2001 prior to the sharp decline in earn-ings. Although most of the categories of
banks under consideration in this article in-creased their return on equity, this did notmatch their earlier levels in all cases.
There was a sharp rise in taxes on income and
earnings in 2005, which went up from 35.6
billion in 2004 to 39.8 billion. Although the
tax expenses of most categories of bankschanged only slightly on the year, they wereup considerably for the big banks at 34.0 bil-
lion, compared with - 30.2 billion in 2004.
After tax, the German banking industry’sprofit for the financial year 2005 totalled323.5 billion, compared with 34.8 billion in
the previous year.

30banking industry as a whole, reduced the
profit for the financial year after tax in 2005as well. In addition, considerably more re-sources were allocated to the fund for gen-eral banking risks than in 2004. The relevantbalance from additions and deductionsamounted to 37.4 billion, compared with
31.4 billion in the previous year. Finally, 34.2
billion flowed to the accumulation of reservesand participation rights capital after the Ger-man banks had drawn on these provisions inthe previous year to stabilise their recordedprofit. On balance, there was a sharp year-on-year rise in the recorded balance sheetprofit for the German banking industry as awhole; it amounted to 39.2 billion in 2005,
compared with 34.0 billion in 2004 and 33.6
billion in 2003.
Outlook
For the current financial year, a stabilisation in
the achieved level of income is becoming ap-parent so far. German credit institutions’interest business is likely to benefit from theupturn in the German economy. Given thecurrent interest rate environment, it is uncer-tain how far this will lead to an increase innet interest received. Much as in 2005, a per-
ceptible growth in profit is far more likely todepend on net commissions received and onthe trading result, the development of whichis closely linked to the situation in the capitalmarkets. According to the figures available todate, the rise in share prices in the first quar-ter made a more positive contribution toprofit than in the previous year. Owing togreater uncertainty in the capital marketswhich occurred in the second quarter, it willprobably be difficult to achieve as high a levelof net income in the financial year 2006 as in2005. On the cost side, it remains to be seento what extent general administrative spend-ing will be further contained by the restruc-turing measures implemented over the pastfew years. As things stand at present, owingto the continued decline in the number ofcorporate insolvencies in the first half of theyear, it is unlikely that there will be a signifi-cant increase in the German banking indus-try’s risk provisioning. However, it is also un-likely that there will be major scope for a fur-ther significant reduction in the burden ofvalue adjustments as, on a longer-term com-parison, the level now reached by some cat-egories of banks is already rather low.

43German foreign
direct investment (FDI)
relationships:
recent trends and
macroeconomic effectsSince the beginning of the 1990s, the
German economy’s international cap-ital links have increased sharply. WhileGerman outward FDI stocks have risensharply (sixfold), inward FDI has alsogone up markedly in this period (four-fold). Against the backdrop of com-paratively subdued investment activityin recent years and employment prob-lems in Germany, this raises the ques-tion of what impact outward FDI byGerman firms will have on Germany.
The empirical studies presented here
come to the conclusion that outwardFDI by German enterprises will nothave a detrimental effect on invest-ment in Germany over the long term.In macroeconomic terms, the increasein employment at foreign subsidiariesdoes not mean a loss of jobs in Ger-many, either. It would appear that theincreased foreign presence has madethe German economy more competi-tive overall. Finally, it is evident thatthe high level of German FDI in thenew EU member states has resulted inchanges in trade relations with the oldEU member states.
Development and structure of German
enterprises’ international capital links
The German economy’s international capital
links have continued to grow in the past fewyears, though no longer as rapidly as at theend of the previous decade. All the same,

44German enterprises have invested around
31341/C252billion abroad since 2001, 3261/C252bil-
lion of it in the first half of 2006 alone. At thesame time, foreign parent companies havepoured 3132
1/C252billion into their German sub-
sidiaries in the past 51/C252years ( 36 billion in the
first half of 2006).
Essentially, cross-border FDI flows involve
using equity capital to set up and expand sub-sidiaries or for mergers and acquisitions. Attimes, however, reinvested earnings, as wellas the provision of credit (which, as a substi-tute for capital, likewise counts as direct in-vestment), were also important factors.
1The
form of financing chosen by the investing en-terprise depends on various factors: not onlythe performance of parent companies andsubsidiaries and the financing conditions inthe financial markets but also tax consider-ations are often significant.
2
The FDI stock statistics, in an even moremarked fashion than the flow statistics(which are reported in the German balance ofpayments), show how German enterprises’international capital links have developed inrecent years. The particular advantage ofusing stock statistics is that, in addition to dir-ect (or primary) participating interests, theyinclude indirect (or secondary) participatinginterests, often realised via holding com-panies.
German FDI assets
3(data are currently avail-
able up to and including 2004) most recentlyamounted to 3677 billion. Conversely, 3345
billion of foreign funds was invested in sub-sidiaries of foreign-owned companies in Ger-many. At the beginning of the 1990s, the cor-
responding figures were 3116 billion and 385
billion, respectively. German enterprises, inparticular, have since considerably strength-ened their international orientation and setup production or distribution sites abroad, aswell as taken over entire enterprises. Even ifthe momentum of growth has slowed follow-ing the bursting of the “new economy” bub-ble and the fall in share prices at the begin-Composition of FDI flows

Under an operational form of this definition and in ac-
cordance with international requirements, an equity
threshold of 10% of equity or voting rights is generally
used.

The tencountries that joined the EU in 2004 now ac-count for as much as 6%; at the beginning ofthe 1990s, before the markets in central andeastern Europe opened up following the fallof the Iron Curtain, they were virtually mean-ingless as destinations for German FDI. Bycontrast, emerging Asia has so far not been asignificant target of German enterprises’ FDIactivities. In recent years, however, somecountries in the region have become pre-
ferred locations for new investment fromGermany. For example, investment in thePeople’s Republic of China increased tenfoldbetween 1994 and 2004. At 38
1/C252billion, it
currently amounts to just over 1% of Germa-ny’s total FDI stocks.

4697% of investment in Germany come from
this group of countries, with the partnercountries of the EU-15 (70%) and NorthAmerica (15%) having the lion’s share.
In the analysis of the sectoral structure, the
advantage of German FDI stock data overtransaction data is that secondary FDI is in-cluded in the statistics. In the case of depend-ent intermediary holding companies with par-ticipating interests subject to the reporting re-quirements, the investor’s actual interest onwhich a direct investment is based can there-fore be made visible in many cases.
In terms of amounts, German FDI activities
are concentrated in the services sector (71%),mainly in the financial intermediation sector(37%). Both trade and the transportation andcommunication sector likewise played a key
role. Manufacturing, led by the chemicals in-dustry and the car sector, accounts for around25%.
With the increasing foreign presence of Ger-
man firms, employment in direct investmententerprises has increased sharply. The numberof persons employed in German-owned for-eign subsidiaries has risen to some 4
1/C252million
in the past decade and a half, thereby almostdoubling. Foreign employment peaked in2002. According to the companies’ data, thenumber of persons employed at foreign sub-sidiaries required to report has since fallenslightly, although this may also be due in partAs at end-2004

have therefore moved more or less in parallelwith, but not quite at the same pace as, in-vestment amounts. Differences are locatedmainly in the sectoral distribution. Whereasthe vast majority of invested amounts is inthe services sector, manufacturing accountsfor the majority of persons in work (57%); ofthese, a large percentage are active in themanufacture of transport equipment (17%).This suggests that labour-intensive activitiesin these sectors are particularly important.This is more likely, however, to be a sector-specific phenomenon rather than a definingcharacteristic of FDI subsidiaries.
In the German branches of foreign direct in-
vestors, changes in the number of personsemployed were comparatively minor. For ex-ample, the figure stood at 2
1/C254million persons
in 2004, only just under half a million abovethe figure for 1990. The sectoral structure ofemployment in domestic FDI enterprises issimilar to that described above. Here, too,manufacturing (60%) dominates, with themanufacture of transport equipment (15%)accounting for the largest share.
German outward FDI: effects on domestic
investment and employment
Against the backdrop of comparatively weak
domestic investment activity in recent yearsand the problems in the domestic labour mar-ket, the high level of German FDI and theassociated establishment of employmentabroad have encountered some criticism fromthe public. This raises the question as to whateconomic links exist between these phenom-
ena at the macroeconomic level. In an initialstep, a relationship can be created betweenFDI and employment in direct investment en-terprises and the relevant domestic indicatorsto get an idea of the dimensions involvedhere. In doing so, however, it should not beoverlooked that, precisely in the case of par-ticularly high-value mergers and acquisitions,FDI is, initially, no more than the transfer ofownership, which is far different conceptuallyfrom domestic non-residential private fixedinvestments. Direct conclusions thereforecannot be drawn about implications for thereal economy from the data on the size of theinvestment alone. That will be followed in asecond step by an econometric analysis of therelationship.
In terms of domestic non-residential private
fixed investments, the German inward andoutward FDI flows are currently of fairlyminor significance (both around 3% in 2005).Over a ten-year period (1996-2005), theshare of German investment abroad was 9%and that of foreign investment in Germany7
1/C252%. However, the higher figures can be at-
tributed mainly to the boom of the last waveof mergers and acquisitions at the turn of themillennium, with some firms being noticeablyovervalued. In terms of GDP , FDI made up lessthan 2% on an average of the last ten years
7In 2002, the reporting thresholds for cross-border cap-
ital investment were harmonised. The reporting threshold
for majority stakes was raised to 33 million and, at the
same time, that for minority stakes reduced to the same
amount. This led to a fall in the number of units covered
– and thereby also in the level of foreign employment
covered. However, since predominantly smaller enter-
prises were affected, there was no impact on basic
growth trends.Employment

48and, most recently, only about1/C252%. The rela-
tionships outlined suggest that the extent ofFDI should not be assessed as exceptionallylarge. This is confirmed by an internationalcomparison. In the ten-year period specified,Germany’s share of the OECD countries’ totaloutward FDI came to 7%, below Germany’sshare of the OECD countries’ overall GDP ,which amounted to just over 7
1/C252% in the
same period.
Despite these caveats, a comparison of the
sharp increase in German FDI (13% per yearon average between 1996 and 2005 as a re-sult of the acquisition of equity interestsalone) with the developments in domesticnon-residential private fixed investments,which declined slightly at the same time,could suggest a certain substitution effect.However, an econometric study of this rela-
tionship fails to confirm this hypothesis. In-stead, it appears that, in the long term, Ger-man foreign investment tends to benefit theinvestment of enterprises in Germany (seealso the explanatory notes on p 50). Accord-ing to the results of this study, the short-termeffects of outward German FDI can be as-sessed as neutral. The overall weakness in in-vestment in the period under review was evi-dently due to other factors, not least thestructural problems of the German economy,as well as the decline in housing investmentfollowing the post-German reunificationboom.

49in Germany made up around 13% of domes-
tic employees. In the manufacturing sector,foreign employment amounted to just overone-third of employment in this sector in Ger-many; the figure was approximately three-quarters in the chemicals industry and in themanufacture of transport equipment.
8
Conversely, slightly more than 6% of all Ger-man employees were working at enterprisesdirectly or indirectly held by foreigners in2004. In the manufacturing sector, this sharewas around 18% of domestic employees,28% of whom were in the chemicals industryand around one-third in the manufacture oftransport equipment.
These data show, firstly, that FDI and employ-
ment in foreign-owned enterprises are not aone-way street, even though the level of em-ployment at foreign branches of Germanfirms is higher than at the branches of foreignenterprises in Germany. Secondly, a look atemployment figures of individual sectors,such as the chemicals industry, shows justhow different the level of cross-border inte-gration can be.
It would be a mistake, however, to equate
the above-mentioned rise in the number ofemployees in the foreign branches of Germanenterprises to a movement of jobs away fromGermany. In the case of mergers and acquisi-tions, in particular, the increase in foreign em-ployment (by the number of employees at anenterprise that has been taken over) does notallow any conclusions to be drawn regardingcurrent or potential movements of jobsabroad. Although possible (long-term) effectsof such transactions on domestic employ-
ment cannot be ruled out, they take placeonly over time. The establishment of newmanufacturing sites abroad, which is associ-ated with a shift in production away fromGermany, may be a different matter; how-ever, the microeconomic and macroeconomiceffects may likewise differ.
The crucial elements in assessing FDI and its
effects on employment from a microeconom-ic point of view are the motives for decidingto engage in FDI. The academic literature dif-ferentiates between horizontal and verticalFDI. The latter includes a fragmentation ofthe production process and the spinning-offof parts of the production chain to foreignsubsidiaries. Vertical FDI results, for example,from various factor endowments and factorcosts of the countries and involves – for Ger-many, for example – the movement of pro-duction processes, most of which are labour-intensive, to lower-wage countries. The costsavings motive is regarded as the drivingforce behind vertical FDI.
In the case of horizontal FDI, the (end) prod-
uct is produced in the potential distributionmarket. The primary purpose of horizontalFDI is to help obtain market access; as a rule,it takes place between countries with a verysimilar economic structure. It can be expectedwhen proximity to buyers (in respect of trans-port costs, customs duties, hedging againstexchange rate fluctuations or the circumven-tion of trade restrictions) is more importantthan the advantage of concentration at the

50Foreign direct investment and domestic investment
It is occasionally assumed that investors decide be-
tween outward foreign direct investment (FDI) anddomestic investment, thereby placing outward FDIand domestic investment in direct competition. IfFDI abroad results in domestic investment projectsbeing undertaken only to a limited extent or notundertaken at all, one could also indirectly infer po-tential effects on employment. There is a variety ofopinions in the literature.
Feldstein (1995)
1used data for selected OECD coun-
tries to calculate a negative relationship betweenoutward FDI and domestic investment. Desai, Foleyand Hines (2005)
2confirm Feldstein’s results, yet, in
limiting the analysis to the United States and com-panies engaging in direct investment abroad,found a positive relationship.
Indeed, one may reasonably assume that more in-
novative and profitable companies will engage inFDI. This is consistent with recent theories concern-ing FDI decisions
3and has also been confirmed by
some empirical studies. The positive effect for mul-tinationals described by Desai, Foley and Hines istherefore quite conceivable. Hence, the weak pro-pensity of the other companies to invest is thenmore likely to be the result of their low profitabilityand not so much the fault of FDI activities.
Macroeconomically, however, both studies agree
that domestic and foreign investment projects aresubstitutes and accordingly assume that outwardFDI will tend to be associated with domestic joblosses. An empirical study using exclusively Germandata has therefore been conducted to determinewhether this also applies to Germany.
This econometric analysis seeks to calculate the extent
to which a relationship exists between German out-ward FDI, inward FDI in Germany and German non-residential private fixed i nvestments. The equation

(VECM).4PFI denotes non-residential private fixed
investments, FDI INandFDI OUTinward and out-
ward FDI flows respectively, and GDP gross domes-
tic product; cis a constant and "is the error term.5It follows from the results of the estimation (see
table) that, for the German data, a long-run com-plementary relationship exists between Germanoutward FDI and domestic non-residential privatefixed investments ( /C12
3<0). Moreover, causality tests
reveal that outward FDI has an impact on domesticinvestment.
8In the long run, German outward FDI
is therefore associated with an increase in domesticinvestment. By contrast, there is a negative long-run relationship between foreign companies’ FDI inGermany and domestic companies’ fixed capital for-mation. As it is not possible to identify a causal rela-tionship here with any certainty, it does not seemappropriate to interpret this as a displacement ofGerman companies’ investment by inward FDI.Rather, the substitutional relationship could beseen as a sign that, in both cases, investment deci-sions are being guided by different locational fac-tors.
It is therefore not possible to confirm here that out-
ward FDI has a negative effect on the domestic sec-tor, as has been frequently alleged in the public de-bate. Rather, the results suggest that, in the longrun, outward FDI may be expected to have a favour-able impact on domestic investment.

51home location (particularly through econ-
omies of scale).
Another motive for FDI is the sale of domestic
products. Once an export market has at-tained a certain level of importance, exportsare followed by FDI so that, for instance, sell-ers can orient their distribution strategies inthe foreign market more closely to their cus-tomers.
The potential effects on the domestic econ-
omy will probably vary depending on the pre-vailing motive. Vertical FDI, through which la-bour-intensive, and thus in high-wage coun-tries cost-intensive, parts of production isgenerally relocated, could initially lead to a re-duction in domestic employment in the in-vesting enterprise. By contrast, FDI with theidea of tapping markets or of setting up andexpanding distribution structures primarilycontributes to the creation or safeguarding ofdomestic jobs.
In the case of German FDI, the strong links
with developed economies and the mutualinterrelationships at the same sectoral levelindicate that market access and distributionare the predominant motives, and not purecost saving. However, there is evidence – par-ticularly for the central and east Europeancountries – that German enterprises are alsoincreasingly engaging in vertical FDI, along-side horizontal FDI.
The latest survey by the German Chamber of
Industry and Commerce on the investment ofGerman enterprises abroad essentially con-firms this line of thinking.
9According to thesurvey, German enterprises are planning to
continue their major expansion of their for-eign manufacturing sites as well as of theircustomer service and distribution structures.However, this development is now also coin-ciding with an upturn in domestic invest-ment. Whereas cost savings continue topresent a strong motive for foreign invest-ment, the more sales-oriented motives ofmarket access and distribution prevail (com-bined 69% of replies, up from 66% in theprevious year), increasingly so, in fact, accord-ing to the findings of this study. Even for re-gions in which the cost advantages of pro-duction would normally be considered to bethe main motive, such as the central and eastEuropean countries which joined the EU inMay 2004, as well as other east and south-east European and Asian countries, FDI deci-sions were guided by sales-oriented consider-ations. At the same time, however, these arealso the regions in which German enterprises,owing to locational disadvantages in Ger-many, prefer to invest. In total, 39% of all for-eign investment projects could also be carriedout in Germany in situations where locationalconditions were more favourable.
At the macroeconomic level, it is in no way
clear that FDI necessarily leads to negativeemployment effects – even if it takes placeprimarily for cost motives. A shift in produc-tion can result in quite positive – mostly indir-ect – stimuli for domestic employment. Thefollowing aspects could play a role in this re-

52spect: increased productivity and competitive-
ness of the domestic enterprises that havetransferred parts of the production chainabroad in order to cut costs, a lower pricelevel for the end customers in some cases, in-creased export growth, as well as higher re-turns on investment, and larger real income,associated with a stimulation of domesticdemand.
However, relocation of research and develop-
ment units has a detrimental macroeconomiceffect, as such relocation could lead to a de-cline in domestic innovativeness. Even if theresearch and development functions remainat home, there is still usually a transfer ofknowledge abroad. In addition, there may bea loss of tax revenue as a result of FDI be-cause profits are transferred to the host coun-tries and taxed at lower rates. The regional ef-fects of individual shifts of operations are like-ly to be comparatively significant, especiallyin the case of structurally weak regions,whereas at the macroeconomic level the ef-fects of individual activities are normally neg-ligible.
Empirical studies of the employment effects
of German FDI are adversely affected by thefact that measuring employment effects leadsto a host of data-related problems. One fun-damental problem is that, at the level of eco-nomic units relevant to FDI decisions and ef-fects, no link can be made between the infor-mation on employment and investment inGermany or abroad using the microdata avail-able. In addition, the international links of theproduction processes do not exclusively haveto be via FDI; intermediate goods can also bepurchased by third-party foreign contracting
parties. Although overall effects can be ana-lysed at the aggregate level, in the absence ofsuitable data, not all facets of offshoring (therelocation of business processes to othercountries) can be taken into considerationhere, either.
10The findings of econometric
studies on the macroeconomic effects of FDIcould therefore be biased.
Despite these limitations, various empirical
studies do not find any evidence to supportthe popular view that outward German FDI isassociated with negative employment effectsin Germany. As mentioned above, GermanFDI has also benefited domestic investment inthe long term. If a positive link between in-vestment and the creation of jobs is assumed,outward FDI can be expected to have a fa-vourable impact on the domestic labour mar-ket in the long term. It should be noted, how-ever, that the shifting of labour-intensive pro-cesses to other countries is likely to be accom-panied by more labour-intensive productionin Germany and a higher skill level amongemployees.
11
However, a positive employment effect ofoutward FDI on Germany can also be con-firmed by estimating the labour demandfunction using the Bundesbank’s macroeco-nomic model. For this purpose, employment
10In addition to FDI, this includes the order-based pro-
duction abroad not captured in the statistics.
11J/C228ckle (2006), for example, shows that German FDI
leads to an increase in the skill level in Germany. Accord-
ingly, the demand for highly-skilled labour rises faster
relative to that for low-skilled employees. This correlation
applies to FDI in developed and developing countries
alike. See R J/C228ckle (2006), The Impact of FDI on the Skill

53at foreign branches of German firms was
added to the relevant equation as an add-itional explanatory variable. According to this,the link between domestic demand for labourand foreign employment by German enter-prises tends to be neutral in the short term. Inthe long term, a slightly positive effect on thedemand for labour can be demonstrated.

Changes in the locational decisionsof German enterprises following EUenlargement and their effectson German foreign trade
The strategic options of domestic enterprises
have increased markedly with the opening ofthe central and east European markets in the1990s and the enlargement of the EU in2004: new export markets and cost-effectivepotential production sites appeared right onGermany’s doorstep. German enterpriseshave seized the available opportunities and– as described – invested heavily in the newEU member states. At the same time, Ger-man foreign trade with these countries hasincreased sharply. The way this has affectedGerman FDI in, and foreign trade with, theold EU countries is examined below.
The setting-up of new sites in central and
eastern Europe and the relocation of produc-tion processes there could have had a nega-tive effect on the number of branches of Ger-man enterprises in the old EU countries. Tofind out whether the suspected geographicalreorientation has indeed happened, the num-ber of investment objects held by each indi-vidual enterprise (with affiliates abroad) in theold and new EU countries between 1996 and
2004 was counted using the Bundesbank’sMicrodatabase Direct Investment (MiDi).
13
Subsequently, the researchers determinedwhether there were more, fewer or the samenumber of affiliates in the old and new EUcountries over time. The results are shown inthe table above. The arrows indicate whetherChanges in the number of German

54Deutsche BundesbankThe impact of FDI on import structure
The increasing integration of the EU since the completion 
of the single market in 1993 and the greater involve-ment of the central and east European economies in the international division of labour are also reﬂ  ected in the 
structure of German production and in German foreign trade. One example is that some old EU member states have seen a fall in their share of German imports, while there has been a sharp rise in German imports from the new EU member states in central and eastern Europe.
This raises the question of whether the regional shift in 
German imports is solely the result of direct competition between foreign sellers in the global market or whether it can also be partially attributed to German companies’ strategic decisions. Indeed, it emerges that the shifts 
observed in the structure of German imports are partly 
due to German FDI.
In the following study, the manufacture of transport 
equipment will serve as an example. The second half of 
the 1990s, in particular, saw the import shares of three of 
Germany’s most important EU trading partners (France, Italy and Spain) and those of the central European EU 
member states –  the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, 
Slovakia and Slovenia – move in opposite directions in 
this sector. Whereas the old EU member states witnessed 
a fall in their share of German imports, the share of Ger-man imports attributable to the new EU member states 
jumped particularly dynamically, from 2% in 1994 to just 
under 16% in 2005 (at 2000 prices).
At the same time, the manufacture of transport equip-
ment is by far the most important industrial sector for German FDI in the central European EU member states. 
German FDI stocks in those countries, at over €4 billion 
(at 2000 prices) in 2004, were nearly twice as high as the amount of FDI in the chemicals industry, the second 
most important industrial sector for German investors. Moreover, German enterprises’ foreign investment in the central and east European economies in the trans-port equipment manufacturing sector has been rising continuously in the past few years, whereas in France, Italy and Spain such activities have largely stagnated.

The estimates presented here show a direct relationship between the subdued momentum of German imports 
of transport equipment from France, Italy and Spain 
and the relative inactivity of German investors in these 
economies.
5 What this indicates is that, as a consequence 
of the lower amount of activity of German enterprises, fewer semiﬁ  nished or ﬁ  nished products are exported 
from those countries to Germany. 
Moreover, the increase in the FDI of German manu-
facturers of transport equipment in central Europe 
impacts adversely on Germany’s imports from the old EU member states. As expected, this indirect relationship 
is not as strong as the direct relationship between FDI 
and imports. However, the assumption that outsourc-ing elements of the production process also inﬂ  uences 
external economic relationships to third countries is also conﬁ rmed. This implies a direct competitive relationship 
between FDI-induced imports from the ﬁ  ve central Euro-
pean countries and imports from the old EU member states.
6
Finally, what the studies also clearly show is that, in the 
manufacture of transport equipment – irrespective of the 
impact of German FDI – German imports from the three old EU countries are growing more slowly than imports 
from the rest of the world. In other words, France, Italy 
and Spain are losing import shares in Germany: the elasticity of imports from these countries relative to all 
imports in this sector, at 0.6, is clearly smaller than 1. 
This indicates that there are other factors behind those countries’ relatively weak export performance. 
This is consistent with the observation that nearly all 
industrial countries have lost ground in world trade in 
the past 20 years to new competitors in Asia and Europe. The explicit inclusion of price competitiveness based on 
nominal unit wage costs
 7 yielded no signiﬁ  cant results. 
One likely reason is that price competitiveness also impacts on the host country’s attractiveness for FDI and 
correlates strongly with the relevant variables.
and A Jochem (2005), Trade Balances of the Central and East European 
EU Member States and the Role of Foreign Direct Investment, Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper Series 1, No 41/2005. The low value of the elasticity can be explained by the fact that a relationship has been established between stocks (of FDI) and ﬂ  ows (of imports). The long-
run impact of FDI on foreign trade, however, results from the cumula-tive value throughout the lifetime of the foreign activity. — 6 Whereas 
FDI-induced imports from central Europe are thus implicitly integrated into the estimation, total imports from the ﬁ  ve central European coun-tries turn out not to be statistically signiﬁ  cant in the econometric study. 
This is probably attributable to the high multi-collinearity between outward FDI to central Europe and imports from central Europe. The lack of signiﬁ  cance, however, could also be because imports not caused 
directly by outward FDI are not mutually competitive. — 7 In the pro-

The largest individual group of German enter-prises (just under 40%) increased its invest-ment in both regions. These enterprises,which are expanding greatly abroad, focusedon trade, the manufacture of transportequipment, the manufacture of (other) ma-chinery and equipment, the metal-workingindustry, as well as on information and com-munications technology. According to theGerman Chamber of Industry and Commercestudy, too, the above sectors are amongthose expanding the most, with – in line withthe observations made here – tapping newmarkets or setting up distribution and cus-tomer networks being listed as the main mo-tives for the FDI decisions. About 9
1/C252%o f
firms reduced the number of their branchesboth in the new and old member states. Itcan be observed that symmetric behaviourgenerally tends to be the dominant methodof locational decisions (six out of ten enter-prises). Only in the group of enterpriseswhose investment in the old EU countries didnot change in the observation period do theenterprises with more investment objects inthe new EU countries at the same time slight-ly outweigh the others. A general tendencyto relocate branches from the old EU coun-tries to the new EU countries cannot be in-ferred from these observations. On the con-trary: in most cases, enterprises which invest-ed heavily in the new EU countries between1996 and 2004 also invested more heavily inthe old EU countries at the same time.Essentially, affiliation to an economic sector
could be significant in this context for the be-haviour of direct investors. Even in a sectorallydisaggregated analysis, however, there areonly minor differences in the choice of invest-ment site. For example, limiting the analysisto manufacturing enterprises does not leadto a qualitatively different outcome: around60% of enterprises still exhibit symmetricbehaviour.
If the analysis is based on the change in the
number of employees, a similar picture is ob-tained. Here, too, symmetric behaviour dom-inates (over 60%), and the relative trends inthe number of affiliates are also reflected inthe relative trends in employee figures.
Some 1,200 additional affiliates were set up
or acquired in the old EU countries in the ob-servation period, compared with “only”slightly more than 800 in the ten new EUcountries. At the same time, however, thenumber of staff in the new EU countries rosesomewhat more sharply than in the old EUcountries (by 252,000, compared with195,000). Average staff numbers evidentlyrose more sharply at the manufacturing sitesof the new EU countries than they did in theold EU countries. Relevant factors will prob-ably include shifts between existing manufac-

ber of them – as well as the conducting ofmore labour-intensive processes in the newmember states.
FDI in general, and the shift in production
processes observed here, in particular, are as-sociated with changes in foreign trade. Thisapplies both directly to trade with the coun-tries with which there is an investment rela-tionship and indirectly to trade with thirdcountries. For example, the setting-up ofmanufacturing and distribution sites in a re-gion may be associated with increased deliv-eries of capital goods and intermediate goodsto that region from Germany. On the otherhand, the on-site production associated withFDI could conceivably displace German ex-ports to the target countries. Finally, rising im-ports of goods from newly establishedbranches may lead to a substitution of im-ports from other countries.
Earlier studies which focused mostly on the
direct effects came to the conclusion for Ger-many that, all in all, FDI has a positive effecton imports and exports; ie it has a comple-mentary effect. According to these studies,the shift in production to the export markets,which tends to reduce trade, is more thanoffset by the stimulating effect of the setting-up of new distribution channels, the openingof markets and the vertical integration of theproduction processes.
16
A more recent econometric analysis has nowexamined the extent to which German out-ward FDI has affected Germany’s trade withthird countries (see explanatory notes onpp 54-55). Using the manufacture of German
transport equipment, it can be shown thatthe subdued pace of German imports ofmotor vehicles and motor vehicle parts fromthe old EU countries (particularly from France,Italy and Spain) is associated with the Germancar industry’s declining propensity to invest inthese countries. Furthermore, these tradeflows are detrimentally affected by the in-creasing direct investment of German manu-facturers in the new EU countries. Althoughthis indirect effect is weaker than the directeffect, it – along with other factors – is statis-tically significant. The significant German in-vestment in the manufacture of transportequipment in the central and east Europeancountries has evidently led to a rise in importsfrom those countries and – in some cases, atleast – displaced imports from the traditionalsupplier countries specified.
Summary and conclusions
German enterprises have further expanded
their foreign presence in recent years. Hori-zontal FDI, the primary purpose of which is tohelp open up markets, is the dominant form.This is consistent with both the analysis of thedata to hand and the findings of a recent sur-
15This is also apparent when looking at, among other
things, changes in staff numbers for the enterprises with
an unchanged number of affiliates in both regions (see
table on p 53). Here, average employment fell in the old
EU countries and, at the same time, rose in the new EU
countries.

Industry and Commerce. The internationalexpansion can be attributed primarily to thegrowth of multinational enterprises and notto major shifts of production sites.
Cost-driven FDI is to be seen against the
backdrop of increased competitive pressure.Domestic enterprises evidently have specificqualities which make it possible for them tocompete internationally. However, these ad-vantages cannot always be exploited in Ger-many. Shifting production abroad is thereforenecessary to ensure the competitiveness and,ultimately, the long-term survival of enter-prises and jobs in Germany. Although isolatednegative short-term effects of foreign invest-ment – such as on domestic employment –cannot be ruled out, overall, the studies pre-sented here suggest that – in the longer term,at least – the positive effects on both invest-ment and employment will prevail.Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that
some investment projects could also be real-ised in Germany with better locational condi-tions. However, this is fundamentally predi-cated on progress regarding the frameworkfor investment in Germany. This includes re-forms to the labour, wage and tax laws, aswell as a significant reduction in bureaucracy.
The international expansion of German enter-
prises has also affected Germany’s existingeconomic relationships with foreign coun-tries. Even though there has not been a majormigration of affiliates from the old EU coun-tries to the new EU countries, the structure offoreign trade has certainly undergone a per-ceptible shift. In particular, imports fromFrance, Italy and Spain appear to have beendampened in certain sectors, such as themanufacture of transport equipment, by thecreation of new production capacity in neigh-bouring central and east European countries.This shows that FDI can also affect countrieswhich are not directly involved.

59The evolution
of labour market-
related expenditureLabour market developments influence
government expenditure in a number ofways. They affect spending on wagesubstitutes, means-tested social transfersand active labour market policy as wellas the level of revenue from taxes andsocial security contributions. Alongsidecyclical developments, the most signifi-cant influences over the past ten yearshave been the increase in long-term un-employment and, more recently, the re-duction of active labour market policymeasures, which were widely consideredunsuccessful. Although the HartzIV re-form of the labour market entails higherspending by central government, the as-sociated rise is much smaller for generalgovernment as a whole. The reform hasmade the transfer system both moretransparent and more consistent. Theadopted measures to restrict unemploy-ment benefit and curb active labourmarket policy will ease pressure on gov-ernment budgets in the future. Never-theless, a clearer segregation of insur-ance benefits on the one hand andtransfer payments on the other remainsa key requirement. In addition, the opti-misation and consistent implementationof existing policy instruments, coupledwith further labour market flexibility,appear more promising than experi-menting with new subsidised and min-imum wage models. The contributionrate to the Federal Employment Agencyshould be set at a level that ensures thatthe system can also cope with economicdownturns.

60General government and the labour market
are closely intertwined. Alongside the publicsector’s role as a major employer, governmentactivities exert short, medium and long-termeffects on macroeconomic developments andhence also on employment. However, thegovernment also has a decisive impact on la-bour market regulation; moreover, the tax-ation and transfer system plays a key role inthe incentives to recruit or accept a job offer.On the other hand – and this is the focus ofthis article – labour market developmentsalso affect government budgets in severalways. Rising unemployment figures meanlower tax and social security revenue. More-over, they entail higher spending, in particu-lar, on wage substitutes or means-tested so-cial transfers. Likewise, active labour marketpolicy measures also have an impact on gov-ernment budgets.
Overview of labour market-related
burdens on government budgetsbetween 1995 and 2005
In recent years, the development of labour
market-related burdens on governmentbudgets has been subject to both cyclical andstructural influences. Thus on the one hand,the upswing around the start of the millen-nium led temporarily to a perceptible easingof the pressure on public finances. On theother hand, structural unemployment ex-panded noticeably between 1995 and 2005,which was reflected in a rise in long-term un-employment. This period was also marked bya mass of new legislation, particularly theHartz Acts (for a summary, see the annex on
p 79).
On the expenditure side, labour market de-
velopments mainly have an impact on un-employment benefit (unemployment bene-fit I), unemployment assistance (unemploy-ment benefit II since 2005) and active labourmarket policy measures. Social assistance andcorresponding housing allowances for per-sons able to work and their dependants canalso be included here (until the end of 2004),although they can be estimated only roughly.Total expenditure defined in this way rosefrom just under 381 billion in 1995 to 397
million in 2005. As a share of GDP , it amount-ed to almost 4
1/C252% both at the beginning and
end of the period under review, although itdipped considerably to below 4% in 2000and 2001 (see the chart on page 61). A shiftin the financing burdens towards the centralgovernment budget occurred over time,mainly in connection with the increase inlong-term unemployment, the curbs on ac-tive labour market policy and the Hartz IVreform.
The fiscal burdens generated by unemploy-
ment also stem from lower tax and social se-curity receipts. According to estimates madeby the Institute for Employment Research(which are not fully comparable with theabove definitions and calculations), these lostreceipts amounted to around 340 billion in
2004; social security contributions accountedfor roughly three-fifths and tax receipts fortwo-fifths of this total. Estimates for the rev-enue side invariably encounter greater meth-odological difficulties and should therefore beMultiple links

Federal Employment Agency:
financial protection against temporaryunemployment
The Federal Employment Agency provides
protection against the risk of a loss of incomedue to temporary unemployment, which is fi-nanced by contributions. As is typical of socialsecurity schemes, contributions are not differ-entiated according to an individual risk as-sessment. In addition, the Federal Employ-ment Agency funds numerous labour marketpolicy measures encompassing rehabilitation,training and job creation. It is also the publicagency responsible for finding work for theunemployed.
The Agency’s principal source of funds is
earnings-related contributions from thoseemployees liable to them (these accounted inthe past for between 80% and 90% of totalrevenue). They are payable in equal measureby the employee and employer. Since 1993,the contribution rate has remained at 6.5%.Additional funds come notably from centralgovernment liquidity assistance during theyear, which hitherto has been converted intoa grant at year-end if the Agency’s financialsituation precludes repayment. In the past,fluctuating income and expenditure wasregularly offset by the Federal grant as theAgency had no available reserves of note. Un-employment benefit I accounts for about halfof all expenditure, while active labour marketpolicy represents between 30% and 40%.
The Agency also incurred administrationcosts. Among its further expenditure, it paidinsolvency benefits and payments related tophased retirement (see table on page 64).
The macroeconomic trend is of crucial import-
ance for the Agency’ s finances. The favourableeconomic climate at the turn of the centuryspurred a temporary marked recovery on thelabour market. Accordingly, the Agency’s def-icit bottomed out at just under 31b i l l i o ni n
2000, after it had peaked at 37 billion in 1996,
and again at just over 36 billion in 2003.

62Deutsche BundesbankThe ﬁ  scal costs of unemployment
according to calculations made by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB)
The ﬁ  scal costs of unemployment are reﬂ  ected in the 
public sector budgets both on the expenditure side 
(in contribution-funded insurance payments and tax-
funded transfer payments) and on the revenue side (in revenue losses from taxes and social contributions). This 
should be differentiated from the macroeconomic costs of unemployment, which cause a reduced economic out-
put owing to unused potential production factors. The macroeconomic costs are deﬁ  ned much more broadly. 
However, it is difﬁ  cult to accurately measure these costs 
because this especially requires having a clear idea of 
the potential output that can be achieved under full employment.
Only a part of the ﬁ  scal costs are also macroeconomic 
costs. While taxes and social contributions are paid from 
labour income and a reduction in their amount ensues from the reduced deployment of the production factor labour, transfers to unemployed persons are simply a 
redistribution of income, although they can have a sta-
bilising effect during an economic downswing. However, these transfers do bring about macroeconomic costs to the extent that the transfers themselves and their fund-
ing cause further underemployment.
The Institute for Employment Research (IAB; Institut für 
Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung ) regularly presents 
calculations regarding the overall ﬁ  scal costs caused by 
persons registered as unemployed.
1 The current calcula-
tions only go up to 2004 and therefore do not include the amalgamation of unemployment assistance and social assistance to form unemployment beneﬁ  t II as of 1 January 2005. The amounts spent by the Federal Employ-
ment Agency on unemployment beneﬁ  t, by central 
government on unemployment assistance and by local government on social assistance for persons registered as 
unemployed are taken into account as direct costs. This is supplemented by housing allowance payments. Rev-
enue shortfalls from taxes and social contributions are 
factored into the equation as indirect costs, based on the remuneration received immediately prior to unemploy-ment. The calculation does not include the ﬁ  scal costs of 
beneﬁ  t recipients who are not counted as unemployed 
(cut-off for 58 year-olds, persons with reduced earning capacity and persons unﬁ  t for work owing to sickness).
According to the calculations of the Institute for Employ-
ment Research, a person registered as unemployed 
in 2004 caused average expenses of €19,600 per year. Recipients of unemployment beneﬁ  t accounted for 
the highest costs, namely about €23,000, whereas the 
amount for recipients of unemployment assistance was 
€18,900. By contrast, persons registered as unemployed 
who received neither unemployment beneﬁ  t nor 
unemployment assistance caused signiﬁ  cantly less costs 
(€14,700). The overall burden determined in this way 
amounted to just under €86 billion. About 54% of the cost was direct spending, while 46% was accounted for by revenue shortfalls – two-ﬁ  fths attributable to taxes 
and three-ﬁ  fths to social contributions.
Over time, the ﬁ  scal costs of unemployment are in 
line with the overall course of economic development. In 1997, they peaked at 4½% of GDP. After declining

63to 3½% in 2001, they rose again to about 4% of GDP 
in 2003 and 2004. In this context, the importance of 
unemployment assistance, which is funded by central 
government, has particularly increased continuously. The revenue shortfalls from social contributions have 
also increased, whereas the tax revenue shortfalls have actually gone down slightly since 1997. While the course 
of development on the expenditure side is mainly char-acterised by cyclical ﬂ  uctuations and a structural increase 
in long-term unemployment, tax and contribution rate 
changes are also a signiﬁ  cant factor behind the revenue 
shortfalls. Rising contribution rates, such as for health insurance, have increased the revenue shortfalls. By contrast, the income tax cuts counteracted the effects of tax progression (ﬁ  scal drag) and ensured a certain 
stabilisation.
When interpreting the results, it should be borne in 
mind that some unemployed persons (in particular those 
above the age of 58, but also the hidden reserve labour 
force) are not taken into account in the calculations of the Institute for Employment Research. Furthermore, the calculation does not include the extensive expenditure on 
people who are not ofﬁ  cially registered as unemployed 
because they are participating in employment promo-
tion schemes or in training and qualiﬁ  cation measures, 
or because as normal (part-time) employees, they receive 
top-up transfers owing to their low labour income. 
Because of this, the total cost is low. By contrast, the revenue shortfalls are set at quite a high level because it is to be expected that, on average, reemployment will only be possible at a lower labour income.As a percentage of GDPFiscal costs of unemployment

64jobs. As a result, associated spending is sub-
ject to relatively sharp cyclical fluctuations(see the chart on page 69), reaching almost330
1/C252billion in 1997. In conjunction with the
subsequent more favourable macroeconomictrend, payments fell to 323
1/C252billion by 2000,
then rebounded to 329 billion in 2003 and
2004, mainly as a result of the economicslowdown. In 2005, payments declined onceagain, by 32 billion.
It should be noted that spending on un-
employment benefit I is not directly related tothe number of registered unemployed. In-stead, it depends on the number of insuredpeople who have been laid off relatively re-cently and on the average benefit payment.The number of recipients (see the chart onpage 65) has declined rapidly, particularlysince 2004. However, this has far more to do
with the expiry of individuals’ eligibility forunemployment benefitI as a result of ongoingunemployment than with any brightening onthe labour market. Hence, the decoupling ofunemployment benefit I spending from thetotal unemployment figure that has beenseen of late primarily reflects growing long-term unemployment.
Since 1994, unemployment benefitI has been
set at 60% of the recipient’s previous stand-ardised net earnings. If the recipient is theparent or guardian of at least one child, thisrises to 67%. However, there was a sharp risein individual entitlements following a rulingby the Federal Constitutional Court in 2000which found that bonus payments had to beincluded in the earnings base from whichTrend in Federal Employment Agency finances

payment rose from 31,150 in 1995 to just

to the statutory pension, health and long-term care insurance schemes). At 13%, theincrease was somewhat greater than the risein gross salaries and wages per employee.The maximum period of entitlement – whichhas since been reduced – was between 6 and32 months depending on a person’s age andthe period they had been insured.
Active labour market policy and
the effects of HartzIV
Initially, 1997 saw a significant reduction in
the Federal Employment Agency’s spendingon labour market policy. However, this wasquickly followed by an exceptionally large in-crease in 1998, an election year. In the fol-lowing three years, spending stabilised at ahigh level, although this concealed a markedshift away from job creation measures to-wards training initiatives. Since 2003, spend-ing on active labour market policy measureshas tapered off substantially and recentlystood at its lowest level since 1990. Whereasthe Agency also financed labour market pol-icy measures for recipients of unemploymentassistance until the introduction of the basicallowance for job seekers (Hartz IV), responsi-bility for such measures was transferred tocentral government in 2005. However, thedecline in active labour market policy spend-ing by almost 35
1/C252billion in 2005 exceeded
that due to the Hartz IV reform.
The structure of active labour market policy
has been influenced by a raft of new legisla-tion (see box on page 66 and the annex on
page 79). The first two Acts Promoting Mod-ern Labour Market Services (Hartz I and II)from 2002 deserve special mention. Whilethey ushered in some new instruments, suchas one-person business start-up grants to un-employed persons or the personnel serviceagencies (PSAs), other benefits – particularlytraining initiatives – were significantly cur-tailed. Whereas barely any funds were chan-nelled into PSAs, a total of 31
1/C252billion was
spent on one-person business start-up grantsin 2005. On balance, however, these instru-ments accounted for less than 13% of theFederal Employment Agency’s total expend-iture on labour market policy measures.Annual average, log scaleThou-

67In parallel with the contraction of active la-
bour market policy, a new stipulation wasintroduced in 2005 as part of the Hartz IV re-form compelling the Federal EmploymentAgency to pay compensation to central gov-ernment whenever benefit recipients switchfrom unemployment benefit I to unemploy-ment benefit II.
2This rule is intended to mo-
tivate the employment agencies to find jobsfor benefit recipients before their entitlementlapses. The number of people transferringfrom unemployment benefit I to II was consid-erably overestimated in 2005. At 34
1/C252billion,
the actual compensatory payment fell almostone-third short of the estimated amount ofjust over 36
1/C252billion.
2005 also brought changes in the allocation
of administrative costs. The transference ofresponsibility for persons formerly receivingsocial assistance who are capable of workingto newly created joint social entities compris-ing employment agencies and municipalitiesmeant that the Federal Employment Agencyincurred additional administration costs.However, these went hand in hand with aneasing of the burden on municipal social wel-fare offices. Central government reimbursedthe administrative costs attributable to recipi-ents of unemployment benefit II. This resultedin an expansion of the Federal EmploymentAgency’s balance sheet. However, the latterwas eased by the fact that the administrativecosts incurred for handling recipients ofinsurance-related payments (such as un-employment benefit I) were considerablylower. Overall, the Federal EmploymentAgency’s administration costs rose from 35
billion to 36
1/C252billion in 2005. The centralgovernment grant towards administrative
costs, which was paid for the first time,amounted to around 33 billion.
Central, state and local government:
means-tested social benefits
Unlike social insurance, central, state and
local government transfers to unemployedpersons who do not, or no longer, claim un-employment benefit I and to low incomeearners do not constitute a wage substitutefinanced by contributions. Instead, they es-sentially constitute a tax-financed means-tested basic allowance. The financial burdenon all sectors of government, particularly cen-tral government, has grown with the increasein long-term unemployment. Hence, tax-financed unemployment assistance based ona recipient’s previous labour income was sys-temically inconsistent, an anomaly that wasremedied with the amalgamation of un-employment assistance and social assistancefor those able to work to form unemploy-ment benefit II. However, a temporaryincome-linked supplement is still paid whentransferring from unemployment benefitI. In2005, the introduction of unemploymentbenefitII enlarged the base of recipients to in-clude people who were previously ineligibleor had never claimed. This change in the sys-tem caused a statistical break which compli-cates analysis of the trend over the past year.
2The compensatory amount is calculated as the number
of recipients in the previous quarter transferring to un-
employment benefitII within three months of the expiry
of their entitlement to unemployment benefitI, multiplied
by the average annual cost of an income-support house-
hold as defined in the Second Book of the Social Security
Code (currently around 310,000).Compensatory

68Trend between 1995 and 2004
Prior to the introduction of the Hartz IV re-
form in 2005, expenditure on unemploymentassistance as narrowly defined accounted forthe bulk of labour market-related spending fi-nanced directly from the central governmentbudget (see the table above). Additional sig-nificant components of expenditure were thegrant to the Federal Employment Agency andspending on housing allowances to un-employed persons who are fit to work (whichis estimated here). As defined here, total la-bour market-related spending by central gov-ernment rose from 321 billion to 327 billion
between 1995 and 2004. Whereas spendingon work promotion fell from 35
1/C252billion to
just over 31 billion, expenses relating to un-
employment assistance nearly doubled to al-most 319 billion. However, this trend was
subject to considerable annual fluctuations(see the chart on page 69). It was constrainedby the progressive tightening of the assess-ment base applied to social contributionstransferred on behalf of recipients of un-employment assistance. Hence, the propor-tion of direct central government paymentsincreased markedly compared with the socialcontributions paid for benefit recipients (fromjust over 55% to 74% of total transfers).However, easing the pressure on central gov-ernment in this way led to a correspondingreduction in revenues for the statutory pen-sion, health and long-term care insuranceschemes. The increase in long-term un-employment was reflected in the statistics forrecipients of unemployment assistance (seethe chart on page 65).

69ents rose from an annual average of just
under one million in 1995 to 11/C252million in
1998; after stabilising for a time, it climbed tojust over two million in 2004.
The labour market-related expenditure of
state and local government lagged far behindthat of central government and the FederalEmployment Agency. This can be quantifiedonly with difficulty, especially for earlieryears.
3State government spent around 34
billion net a year on labour market policy,which equates to just over 1
1/C252% of its overall
budget (the comparable figure for centralgovernment was around 10%).
4State gov-
ernment housing grants to unemployed per-sons able to work rose from 31 billion in
1995 to an estimated 31
1/C252billion in 2004. On
balance, labour market-related spending bystate government has grown only relativelyslightly since 1995. The corresponding figurefor local government is likely to have been310 billion in 2004. Spending on active
labour market policy measures for recipientsof social benefits able to work (promoting areturn to work) has doubled to just over 31
billion since 1995. Over the same period,there was an 8% increase in additional (net)spending on the basic allowance paid to per-sons outside of institutions (social assistancenarrowly defined). A rough estimate indicatesthat, in 2004, payments to social assistancerecipients able to work and their dependants(under the amended Second Book of the So-cial Security Code) totalled just under 37 bil-
lion. These were augmented by the paymentsgranted to such persons for assistance to-wards healthcare (estimated at just over 3

3The following rough estimates are partly based on cal-
culations made by the Conciliation Committee in June
2004 and the Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour
in its 2004 audit report published in October 2005. These
assume a constant 93% share of total expenditure on so-
cial and medical assistance benefits attributable to recipi-
ents able to work and their dependants, and a 77%
share of housing allowances attributable to unemployed
recipients. Owing to the rise in long-term unemployment,
the expenditure calculated in this way might overstate
the actual spending on unemployment in the past. The
estimates of the Federal Ministry of Economics and La-
bour concerning the administrative costs attributable to
social assistance recipients who are able to work are as-
sumed to be virtually constant.

70HartzIV reform and the trend over the
past year
With the entry into force of the Fourth Act
Promoting Modern Labour Market Services(Hartz IV) at the beginning of 2005 un-employment assistance, broadly defined, andsocial assistance for persons able to workwere amalgamated into the basic allowancefor job seekers known as unemployment ben-efit II. As with the former social assistance,standard unemployment benefit II is intendedto cover only basic needs.
5Hence, it differs
from the former unemployment assistance,which was initially linked to the recipient’sprevious estimated net earnings (most recent-ly set at 53% for childless claimants and 57%for those with children). Alongside this stand-ard benefit, the basic allowance includes asupplement, limited to two years, intended tocushion the transition from contribution-financed unemployment benefit I, contribu-tions to the statutory pension, health andlong-term care insurance schemes and theabsorption of accommodation and heatingcosts. Moreover, benefits are envisaged forspecific additional needs and integrationmeasures.
The Hartz IV reform triggered considerable
changes to expenditure responsibilities and fi-nancial relationships between the variouslevels of government. Central governmenttook over financing of the basic allowance(standard unemployment benefitII plus a so-cial allowance for dependants unable towork, payments for additional needs, socialcontributions and the temporary supplementfor the transition from unemployment bene-fit I) and the integration measures for recipi-
ents of unemployment benefit II, which hadpreviously been provided by the Federal Em-ployment Agency and by state and local gov-ernment. Central government also refundsadministrative costs and currently contributes29.1% of the accommodation costs incurredby local government, with the aim of redu-cing the burden on municipalities by 32
1/C252bil-
lion a year. This financing is in addition tofunding one-off accommodation costs (eg forthe first-time furnishing of a flat) and supple-mentary integration services (care, counsel-ling). As already mentioned, central govern-ment receives a compensatory amount fromthe Federal Employment Agency.
With the Hartz IV reform in place, central gov-
ernment’s total labour market-related ex-penditure increased sharply in 2005 by 311
billion to 338 billion. Adjusted for the revenue
from the compensatory amount ( 34
1/C252billion)
and for unemployment assistance for Decem-ber 2004 ( 31
1/C252billion), the increase still
amounted to just under 35 billion. This devel-
opment was driven by the switch to the newbasic allowance for job seekers and thegrowth in long-term unemployment. In 2005,expenditure on the basic allowance totalledover 335 billion, of which 325 billion was
spent on unemployment benefit II, 33

to3150 for each year of a person’s life, up to a maximum
of39,750, plus a retirement saving allowance equivalent

71lion each on labour market reintegration
benefits (especially the promotion of casualwork in addition to benefits – “one-eurojobs”) and contributions to accommodationcosts as well as 33 billion spent on refunding
administration costs. As a result, expenditurewas considerably higher than envisaged(+37
1/C252billion). The unexpected increase in ex-
penditure primarily reflects the high numberof unemployment benefit II recipients, whichactually rose further from 4.5 million at thestart of the year to 5.2 million by year-end.

By contrast, the main saving compared with2004 was the reduction in the grant to theFederal Employment Agency from 34 billion
to just under 3
1/C252billion.
On balance, the HartzIV reform imposed a
significant financial burden on central gov-ernment. State government had agreed topass savings on to local government al-though, given the available figures, the possi-bility cannot be ruled out that it, too, experi-enced some relief. Despite higher-than-antici-pated accommodation costs, the burden onlocal government is likely to have eased per-ceptibly in the context of the new basicallowance owing to the abolition of the ma-jority of social assistance subsistence benefitsand active labour market policy measures(see box on p 72f for the financial repercus-sions of the HartzIV reform). On balance,labour market spending by central, state andlocal government increased markedly in thepast year. Nevertheless, the increase com-pared with the likely scenario had the old sta-
tus quo been maintained was smaller than the
margin by which central government missedits target (it had anticipated a decline in itslabour market-related expenditure), which has
been at the centre of public debate.
Outlook for 2006 and 2007
The development of labour market-related
government expenditure in 2006 is also likelyto have been shaped not least by the eco-nomic recovery. In addition, the shortening ofthe entitlement period for unemploymentbenefitI and various savings in unemploy-ment benefit II will make themselves felt in2007. Overall, labour market-related expend-iture is likely to exert less pressure on generalgovernment budgets this year and next thanin 2005.
Federal Employment AgencyThe Federal Employment Agency’s expend-
iture will have fallen considerably by the endof 2007. A further decline is expected inspending on unemployment benefit I which,besides the favourable economic setting thisyear, can principally be attributed to theshortening of the maximum eligibility periodthat will gradually have an effect from Febru-ary 2007. It was reduced as of 31 January2006 to 12 months for the majority of recipi-ents; an extended 18-month maximum en-titlement period applies for unemployed per-sons aged 55 and over. However, this tighten-ing may spark a temporary increase in the

72Deutsche BundesbankAn estimate of the fiscal costs of the Hartz IV reform
A comprehensive evaluation of the effects of the Hartz IV reform on
general government budgets requires a comparison between the actuallabour market-related expenditure and the expenditure that wouldhave resulted from a status quo scenario, ie the continued separate co-
existence of unemployment assistance and social assistance. For this pur-pose, the actual trends in the labour market and in the need for assis-tance would have to be adjusted for the effects of the reform whichcannot be clearly determined. Moreover, the limited data availability atstate and local government level
1complicates an accurate estimate of
the impact on general government budgets. This article focuses on thepurely fiscal effects of the reform, which encompass direct labour mar-ket-related expenditure but also additional welfare benefits affected bythe reform, such as housing allowance, additional children’s allowanceand social assistance for persons able to work.
Different calculationsAt the end of 2003, the Commission for the Reform of Local Government
Finances foresaw that central and local government could save 53.3 bil-
lion annually by merging unemployment assistance and social assistancefor persons who are able to work. While the audit report of the FederalMinistry of Economics and Labour, completed in the autumn of 2005,shows cost savings of 52.8 billion for local government in 2005, excluding
the revenue received from central government, the Municipal Data Sur-vey (Kommunaldatenerhebung ), which was published at the same time
by the Deutsche Landkreistag, arrives at an additional cost of 51.6 billion
for local government, again excluding the contribution payments re-ceived from central government. One reason for these major differencesis that the audit report is based on the – now repealed – legal criteria forreviewing the cost savings for local government. According to these cri-teria, those recipients of unemployment benefit II who previously re-ceived neither unemployment assistance nor social assistance but whowould have been entitled to social assistance under the old legal status
quoare counted as potential recipients of social assistance. Owing to the
higher number of cases, the calculation therefore results in relatively bigcost savings for local government. By contrast, the Municipal Data Surveyonly records the costs actually incurred for former recipients of social as-sistance who are able to work but does not take into account a possiblerise in the number of recipients of social assistance that might have oc-curred without the Hartz IV reform in 2005. Moreover, the payment flowspublished in the government cash statistics indicate that the savingsmade by state government on housing allowance and integration mea-sures may not have been passed on in full to local government as wasagreed. According to the most recent figures of the Federal Ministry ofLabour and Social Affairs, the costs to general government of 544
1/C252bil-
lion after the labour market reform in 2005 were 51 billion higher than
they would have been had the previous status quo continued.2The table on page 73 shows the results of the calculations for the indivi-
dual levels of government. While the draft budgets for 2005 envisagedcost savings of just over 51 billion compared with 2004, the actual ex-
penditure of central government/the Federal Employment Agency, stategovernment and local government in connection with the Hartz IV re-form was 57 billion higher than the expenditure on unemployment as-
sistance, social assistance for people able to work and housing allow-ance. The additional expenditure of central government ( 59
1/C252billion)
contrasted with cost savings for the Federal Employment Agency, stategovernment and local government (2
1/C252billion). However, compared
with the likely expenditure path given a continuation of the old status
quo, the estimated additional expenditure owing to the reform would
have been “barely” 54 billion, with the balance due to the poor labour
market performance, which would also have caused a rise in costs underthe old status quo .
3The draft budgets make provision for a further, al-
beit smaller rise in expenditure in 2006 before Hartz IV expenditurelooks set to decrease for the first time in 2007 when the statutorychanges agreed upon become fully effective. Taking all social securityfunds into account, the overall burden on general government is ex-pected to be somewhat lower at first. The statutory pension insurancescheme and the long-term care insurance scheme, for example, achievedsavings because the additional revenue from contributions for formersocial assistance recipients able to work and for new recipients whowere not insured previously has so far been accompanied by marginalexpenditure at most. In 2007, however, central government will effec-tively halve its pension contributions for recipients of unemploymentbenefit II.
Causes of the rise in expenditureThe unexpectedly high costs of the Hartz IV reform are primarily due to
inaccurate assessments about the labour market trend and adjusted be-haviour on the part of by those entitled to payments, start-up problemsand legal shortcomings.
4Already before the reform came into force, the
unfavourable labour market trend led to a significant increase in thenumber of recipients of unemployment assistance and social assistance.
5
Moreover, the level of need of the recipients of unemployment assis-tance and their number of household members were underestimated.For example, the poor labour market situation also caused the averagehousehold income – which is offset against benefits – to decrease.When preparing the budget for 2005, the Federal Government expectedan annual average of only 2.5 million income-support households and3.4 million beneficiaries able to work. However, by the end of 2004,there were already an estimated 4.4 million recipients of social assis-tance and/or unemployment assistance who were able to work (includ-ing their dependants able to work). According to estimates made by theFederal Employment Agency, 1.8 million recipients of social assistance

tion of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs can be explained, in par-ticular, by the fact that this calculation assumes lower extrapolation rates for un-employment assistance and social assistance and that it takes into account the (es-timated) expenditure for accommodation costs of recipients of other social bene-fits (eg basic allowance for elderly persons), which arise for local governmentafter the cessation of the housing allowance for this group of persons. — 4See

6The monthly total cost of 5841
per income-support household on an annual average also exceeded theoriginal budgeted figures ( 5819).
The further rise by 1 million in the number of recipients in the course of
2005 is not only due to the start-up problems in managing the flood ofapplications, but also to the increase in long-term unemployment stem-ming from the continued poor labour market situation and to a consid-erable degree also to the new legislation. Compared with the previoussocial assistance, the new Second Book of the Social Security Code led toan enlargement of the group of eligible recipients. For example, the de-fined income and asset ceilings for neediness were raised, the permittedmargins to supplement benefits with earned income were improvedand the housing benefit payments were structured more generouslycompared with the housing allowances granted previously. Many per-sons in need with a low level of income who had previously not appliedfor social assistance owing to insignificant entitlements, low limits forincome and additional earnings, ignorance of statutory regulations con-cerning social assistance or the stigmatising effect of social assistance
7
are now claiming unemployment benefit II. The latter is also indicatedby the fact that the number of persons receiving Hartz IV benefits in ad-dition to their earnings (“income boosters”) doubled in the time fromthe start of the reform to the autumn of 2005. This number is expectedto continue to rise owing to the further improved options for top-upearnings as of October 2005.
In addition, there are legal shortcomings to which Parliament has now
responded. For example, the onus of proof for couples claiming to livein a state of long-term cohabitation resembling marriage has now beenshifted from the Federal Employment Agency to the applicants. The pre-vious regulation allowed “cell divisions” in which couples who were liv-ing together separated pro forma (eg set up flat-sharing communities)
in order to create autonomous income-support households and so avoidtheir partner’s income being offset against unemployment benefit II.Moreover, the law made it easier for young people who had reachedthe legal age of maturity to move out of their parents’ home and claimfull social benefits and accommodation costs irrespective of their par-ents’ financial circumstances. Such behavioural reactions are indicatedby the significant rise in dependent one-person households from justunder 1.9 million at the beginning of 2005 to 2.4 million in April 2006,with higher numbers of recipients particularly among young people. Itwas primarily this margin of discretion afforded by the statutory regu-lations, and probably only to a small extent a rise in abuse of social
benefits
15which, together with the general expansion of the benefit
range, resulted in a substantial increase in the volume of benefitsgranted.
unemployment assistance 14.5%, social assistance 1.5% and assistance in cases of
sickness 3% (in line with the development of previous years). The cost savings forstate and local government resulting from the discontinuance of housing allow-ance and social assistance are determined by means of a comparison with the ac-tual expenditure of the previous year or an extrapolation based on the old legalstatus quo, and not according to the – now repealed – statutory review criteria. —9Estimate based on the assumption of the Federal Ministry of Economics and La-

The 2005 target is derived from theConciliation Committee’s estimate from June 2004; the target figures for 2006and 2007, which were not derived from the Federal budget, largely remainedconstant at the 2005 level. — 15The Federal Employment Agency estimates that

74number of claimants switching to unemploy-
ment benefitII. In addition, a significant re-duction in spending on active labour marketpolicy measures was recorded in the first halfof 2006.
On balance, the Federal Employment Agency
will generate a surplus in 2006 that far ex-ceeds the figure of just under 32 billion pro-
jected in the budget. Bringing forward thedeadline for transferring social contributions,a changeover which has been in place sincethe start of 2006, will provide a one-off boostto the budgetary balance of just over 33 bil-
lion. Along with the central governmentgrant, which will amount to 36
1/C252billion in
2007 and be paid regularly from next yearonwards, the 2006 surplus will also help tooffset the loss of revenue, totalling around315 billion, associated with the lowering of
the contribution rate from 6.5% to 4.5%. Re-serves are to be set up in future so as to cush-ion financial volatility, as in the other socialsecurity funds. This requires significant sur-pluses to be generated in buoyant economicphases, as the Agency’s finances – both onthe revenue and on the expenditure side ofthe balance sheet – react immediately to vola-tility on the labour market. If the reserves areinsufficient, (interest-free) central govern-ment loans will be still available, although in-stead of being converted into grants as hith-erto, they will now have to be repaid at alater stage.
Central governmentThe total resources earmarked for labour
market policy expenditure in the central gov-ernment budget for 2006 are about 31 billion
above the 2005 outturn. Planned spendingon the basic allowance amounts to just over338 billion ( 334 billion after adjustment for
expenses covered by the compensatoryamount), of which just under 324
1/C252billion is
allocated to unemployment benefit II. On bal-ance, extra expenditure and savings could vir-tually cancel each other out during 2006 as awhole. Potential unforeseen additional ex-penditure on unemployment benefit II and ac-commodation costs is likely to be offset by acomparable fall in integration measures(budgeted amount: 36
1/C252billion). As planned,
the Federal Employment Agency will not re-quire a grant from central government, andexpenditure on other active labour marketpromotion measures is unlikely to exceed the2005 figure.
The draft central government budget for
2007 projects a fall in overall spending on thebasic allowance for job seekers to just over333
1/C252billion ( 3281/C252billion after adjusting for
the compensatory amount). However, the fi-nancial risks appear to be greater than in thecurrent year. In view of the uncertainty sur-rounding some of the budgeted savings to beachieved through statutory changes,
7which
are valued at just under 34 billion, the provi-
sion of 3211/C252billion for unemployment bene-
7The largest share (just under 32 billion) is attributable
to the reduction from 2007 in contributions to the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme for recipients of un-
employment benefitII. However, this decline in central
government spending is offset by a corresponding rev-
enue shortfall for the statutory pension insurance
scheme. Alongside certain legislative corrections to the
range of benefits for those under 25, the remainder of
the savings is principally to be achieved through imputed
efficiency gains ( 31.2 billion). These are set against
spending increases of 30.2 billion caused by aligning con-
tribution rates in eastern Germany with western levels.Favourable

75fit II may have been set too low. Hence, 31 bil-
lion of cover for reintegration measures (an-other 36
1/C252billion) has been earmarked to
compensate for additional expenditure onunemployment benefit II. The budget esti-mate also assumes an increase in the com-pensatory amount due from the Federal Em-ployment Agency (to just over 35 billion).
8
Moreover, central government’s contribution
to local government expenditure on accom-modation for recipients of unemploymentbenefitII is scheduled to be cut to 32 billion,
though this must first be approved by theBundesrat. The draft budget also proposes anincrease in central government’s labourmarket-related spending to just over 340 bil-
lion along with its new VAT-financed grant tothe Federal Employment Agency.
Future challenges
Reducing structural unemployment is a para-
mount economic policy requirement in Ger-many. This would substantially reinforce thenecessary consolidation of public finances,particularly at central government level, bypermanently easing the pressure on both therevenue and expenditure side of the generalgovernment budgets. A continuation of thecurrent moderate wage trend, greater flexibil-ity within both the labour market and thewage structure as well as further reforms tothe tax and transfer system would make asignificant contribution to achieving thatgoal.
By contrast, it will only be possible to reduce
the average level of frictional and cyclical un-employment very marginally. Cyclical devel-
opments are affecting revenues at all levels ofgovernment and are having a particular im-pact on Federal Employment Agency expend-iture. The automatic stabilisers functionsmoothly if they balance out surpluses anddeficits over the economic cycle while theFederal Employment Agency’s contributionrate is kept stable. Given the high level ofvolatility, significant reserves must be built upin good times to obviate the need to borrow(as is the case in other social securityschemes).
9
Assuming the Federal Employment Agency’sspending on administration and active labourmarket policy measures remains virtually un-changed at 310 billion then, at current bene-
fit and employment levels, it would be pos-sible to finance an average of around 1.5 mil-lion recipients of unemployment benefit I at acontribution rate of 4.5% (in 2005, this bene-fit was drawn by just over 1.7 million people).A fall (rise) in the average number of recipi-ents by 100,000 would mean a reduction (in-crease) in the contribution rate by 0.2 per-
8One method of achieving this will be to expand the ref-
erence value for this payment in future to include people
whose entitlement under unemployment benefitI falls
short of the level of unemployment benefitII and who
consequently receive supplementary unemployment ben-
efitII (currently 160,000 to 180,000 people). To date, the
compensatory amount has been due only after eligibility
for unemployment benefitI had expired.
9In future, it is envisaged that central government grants
will only be provided in “emergencies”. The aim is to pre-
vent the Federal budget from having to bear the brunt of
cyclical fluctuations. In view of the rationale behind the
Federal government’s budgetary rules restricting borrow-
ing, central government loans to the Federal Employment
Agency would, in future, have to be declared as some-
thing other than regular financial investment. This would
prevent the constitutional threshold for new net borrow-
ing from being systematically undermined if, as is cur-
rently standard practice, loan repayments are not concur-
rently booked as disinvestments.Reducing

76centage point. If, for example, the number of
people drawing unemployment benefit andthe number of employees subject to social se-curity contributions were to fluctuate withina margin of 500,000 people (between its cyc-lical high and low as in the period 1997-2000), this would require an annual surplusof around 34 billion at the cyclical peak.
These surpluses would have to be accumu-lated over several years in order to bridgedownswings of a similar duration. Given thefavourable economic outlook at present,building up reserves now is essential to avoida procyclical adjustment of the contributionrates in future. This also means that the habit-ual political temptation to boost spending orcut contribution rates when reserves are plen-tiful must be resisted.
The introduction of the basic allowance for
job seekers has drawn a clearer distinction be-tween insurance benefits on the one handand the tax-financed means-tested basic al-lowance on the other. The latter has alsobeen structured more systematically andmore consistently. Carrying this logic furtherin future would necessitate reinforcing theFederal Employment Agency’s insurance prin-ciple and, moreover, gearing unemploymentbenefitII more strongly to ensuring that taxresources are used sparingly and selectivelyand, at the same time, to increasing the in-centive to take on regular employment.
The statutory unemployment insurance
scheme still entails a number of non-insurance-related benefits that should not befinanced by wage-based contributions, in-cluding many active labour market policymeasures.
10The additional children’s allow-
ance paid as part of unemployment benefitI(which increases the payment rate from 60%to 67%) is a particularly striking example. An-other questionable feature is the (albeit nowshortened) extended eligibility period applic-able to claimants aged over 55. Fundamental-ly, there is a danger that unemployment willbecome more entrenched the longer a personis eligible for unemployment benefit I. There-fore, a shorter eligibility period with lowercontribution rates would make better sense.
The compensatory amount that the Federal
Employment Agency has to pay to centralgovernment roughly counterbalances the factthat responsibility for funding active labourmarket policy measures for the long-term un-employed has passed from the Agency tocentral government. This being so, it may ap-pear logical to link the payment to the num-ber of people transferring from unemploy-ment benefit I to II. Although this provides anincentive to find work for people before theirentitlement to unemployment benefit I lapses,financing the payment through contributionsappears fundamentally questionable in viewof the insurance principle on which theAgency is based. Hence the compensatoryamount is an extraneous liability imposed onthe Federal Employment Agency, yet it corres-ponds to the income from 0.5 percentagepoint of the contribution rate. Conversely, thefuture central government grant to theAgency should likewise be reconsidered andcoupled to the financing of clearly definednon-insurance-related benefits.

77The debate about new labour market policy instruments
Unemployment and, in particular, long-term
unemployment mainly affect individuals whocan earn only relatively low income in the la-bour market owing to their low productivity.First, laws, wage agreements and de facto
minimum wages set by legal precedence arepartly responsible for the fact that there is in-sufficient demand for legitimate employmentin the low-wage sector. Second, the socialsecurity system guarantees a (socio-cultural)minimum subsistence level which depressesthe supply of labour if claims for benefits arenot consistently reduced for persons who re-ject job opportunities.
The framework established by the HartzIV le-
gislation essentially makes it possible to con-siderably increase incentives to work. The keyto this is that of those who are able to work,only those who are willing to accept a (full-time) job offer are entitled to the full amountof social benefits. If their household incomethen falls below the socio-cultural minimumsubsistence level and their financial circum-stances place them below the poverty line,the state grants a minimum income to avoiddestitution. Thus, the system already providesstate-subsidised pay. To increase the incentiveto work beyond this, earned income is onlypartly offset against social benefits. If thegrant to lowly paid employees were to be ex-tended without reducing unemploymentbenefit II – ie a more comprehensive form ofstate-subsidised pay – this would inevitablyentail a considerable fiscal burden and exten-sive “free-rider” effects. This would also con-tradict the basic principle of granting socialbenefits to prevent poverty.If unemployment is to be reduced to a signifi-
cant extent, the restrictions on the demandfor labour also need to be eased to make thelow-wage segment of the labour marketmore flexible. Both measures together wouldallow employment in the primary labour mar-ket to rise as market forces take effect. Tar-geted government intervention would thenbe largely restricted to preventing destitutionif individuals fall below the poverty line andthis aid is provided directly to those affected.The inherent danger of (industry-specific)minimum wages is that measures to increasethe supply of labour will dry up as a result ofthe HartzIV reform: if productivity is too low,the unemployed will not be integrated intothe primary labour market.
Another possible approach might be for em-
ployers to grant de facto social benefits as
part of broad-based wage cost subsidies. Inthis alternative, the government pays a grantto employers who then pay wages includingthe state subsidy. This would allow minimumwages to be set which enterprises could thenadjust downwards to a level appropriate tothe individual’s productivity with the subsid-ies making up the difference. Such a processwould, however, have considerable disadvan-tages. Greater “free-rider” effects would belikely as subsidies would no longer be grantedon a needs basis. It is extremely difficult to es-timate the associated fiscal burdens, whichwould pose a major financial risk for the gov-ernment. This would also entail governmentintervention in the market mechanism andthe creation of a considerable degree of bur-eaucracy.

78The basic allowance for job seekers can also
be claimed on the basis of need as an add-itional transfer on top of a low earned in-come. As such, it is effectively a wage sub-sidy. The government should refrain fromintroducing an additional comprehensive sys-tem of state-subsidised pay components orwage subsidies, which is associated with con-siderable financial risks, especially given theneed to make the transfer system more trans-parent but also to more selectively target thebeneficiaries of social benefits (see box onpage 77). A better alternative would be tofurther refine the existing system – particular-ly its implementation.
A possible starting point could be to modify
the current progressive thresholds enablingbenefit recipients to obtain additional earnedincome, which are currently geared heavily tosmall top-up earnings, since they inducebenefit recipients to take on only part-timework. A strategy of making acceptance of afull-time job offer compulsory, with a refusalentailing a sharp cut in the benefit entitle-ment, would help to ensure that potentialclaimants first exhaust all available possibil-ities of earning an income of their own beforeclaiming transfers from the state.
11This
would increase the attractiveness of full-timeemployment compared with unemployment(and the associated extra leisure time or in-come from illicit working). To reduce the un-expectedly large burdens on the central gov-ernment budget, the existing level of benefitscould also be adjusted. For example, it mightbe well worth reviewing the temporary incre-ment paid during the transition from un-employment benefit I to II, which is incompat-ible with the insurance principle on which theFederal Employment Agency is based, or thelevel of personal assets that are not offsetagainst the receipt of benefits, which is gen-erously defined compared with the level thatapplied to the old social assistance. Lastly, theallocation of administrative responsibilitiesbetween the Federal Employment Agencyand local government also needs to be moreclearly defined.
11Another approach could be to cut the basic benefit
rate across the board coupled with the compulsory provi-
sion of an employment opportunity. See German Council
