Economic conditions
Underlying trends
For the first quarter of 2014 a considerable ac-
celeration of the overall German economy is 
evident. The cyclical pick-up is temporarily 
being amplified by positive weather- related 
factors. In the last quarter of 2013, the under -
lying cyclical trend is likely to have already sur -
passed the reported growth rate of gross do -
mestic product (GDP) of 0.4% on the quarter 
after seasonal and calendar adjustment; this is 
indicated by the fact that real gross value 
added was up by 0.7%, and final demand by 
1.1%, on the period. In addition, key business 
indicators such as industrial and construction output have been revised upwards for the 
fourth quarter. The upward trend in industrial 
orders, very optimistic output expectations for 
the first quarter (which have already been con-
firmed for January) and the steady improve -
ment in the assessment of the current situation in trade and industry point to very strong GDP growth in the first quarter of 2014. The strong 
increase in seasonally adjusted construction output in January and, according to the Ifo business survey, the exceptionally low inci
-
dence of weather- induced stoppages in the 
main construction industry are particular testi -
mony to the positive impact exerted by the weather in the first two months of the year. The seasonally adjusted GDP growth rate for 
the second quarter, on the other hand, will be 
significantly lower, simply on account of the 
heightened level attained in the first quarter re-
sulting from the very mild winter weather. In 
addition, expectations in trade and industry fell slightly.
Industry
In January 2014, industrial output surpassed its previous month’s level, which had been revised upwards, by only ¼% after seasonal adjust -
ment; however, it was up by a substantial 1½% 
from the final quarter of 2013. Capital goods 
production grew by a strong 2%. Intermediate goods output likewise showed marked growth 
(+1¼%), whereas the production of consumer 
goods rose marginally (+¼%).
New orders received by German industry were 
up in January considerably, by a seasonally ad-
justed 1¼% compared with December. Orders 
for intermediate goods rose by 1½%. Capital goods orders were up by ½% and consumer goods orders by 6¼%, with most of the in
-
crease in demand attributable to pharmaceut -
icals. The overall increase compared with the 
previous quarter’s average was 1¾%. The im -
petus from abroad was larger than that from 
within Germany, mostly due to a 6¼% increase in orders from non- euro- area countries. Orders 
from the euro area fell by 4¾%, but this was 
associated with a decrease in the volume of 
orders from the aircraft and aerospace industry, which originate in non- euro- area countries but 
are passed on within the European production 
network and generally fluctuate strongly. Ex -
cluding other transport equipment, euro-  area 
demand remained at its elevated level of the 
previous quarter.
Turnover in industry was up in January by 2¾% 
from December, after seasonal adjustment, 
and by 3½% from its fourth- quarter average; 
however, domestic sales growth, at 2%, lagged 
behind the growth of foreign sales, at 4½%. Sales growth was particularly pronounced in non- euro- area countries (+6¾%). Growth in 
the euro area was only moderate (+1¼%). In January, the value of exports rose strongly (+2¼%) on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms. Export growth was likewise strong com-pared with the final quarter of 2013 (+1¾%). In 
terms of value, imports in January were up by 
as much as 4¼% on the month and by a con-Strong first

siderable margin compared with the level of 
the last quarter of 2013 (+2¾%).
Construction
Construction output rose in January 2014 by a 
strong 4½%, after seasonal adjustment, from a 
December figure which had been revised up -
wards considerably. It outdid its performance 
for the fourth quarter by 6%. This was attribut-
able to 4¼% growth in the main construction 
sector and to growth in the finishing trades of 7¾%, although this figure is highly susceptible to revision and should therefore be regarded as 
extremely provisional. The main factors in -
cluded not only the good orders situation but 
also the exceptionally mild weather conditions. 
New orders in the main construction sector in 
December (more recent data are not yet avail-
able) were just shy of the previous month’s 
level. Orders for residential property and public 
construction rose considerably, whereas de -
mand for commercial construction fell follow -
ing a sharp increase.
Labour market
The labour market, too, has been benefiting from the improved economy and favourable weather conditions. The number of persons 
employed in Germany rose at the beginning of 2014 by a seasonally adjusted 40,000 from De-
cember, and thus much more strongly than in 
the previous two months. The year- on- year rise 
amounted to 292,000, or 0.7%. According to 
estimates by the Federal Employment Agency, 
November and December saw a significant in-crease in regular jobs subject to social security 
contributions. However, the figures are over -
stated owing to changes in the reporting pro -
cedure and will in all likelihood be revised downwards. All the same, the upward ten
-
dency is likely to have persisted. According to 
the Ifo employment barometer, enterprises’ 
willingness to recruit new staff was up signifi -
cantly, whereas the Federal Employment Agen-Construction

cy’s BA-  X job index slipped somewhat after 
seasonal adjustment. For the fourth quarter of 
2013, the quarterly Job Vacancy Survey con -
ducted by the Institute for Employment Re -
search (IAB) has shown a notable annual in -
crease in the number of job openings in manu-
facturing, and particularly in construction, in 
line with the underlying cyclical trend.
In February, the number of persons registered 
as unemployed continued to decline slightly, by 
14,000 after seasonal adjustment, following a 
drop by 28,000 in January. The unemployment 
rate held firm at 6.8%. Unemployment was 
down by 18,000 persons on the year. Under -
employment (excluding short- time work) also 
declined somewhat. According to the IAB la -
bour market barometer, unemployment is ex -
pected to continue to fall.
Prices
Over the course of February, the price of a bar -
rel of Brent crude oil initially fell distinctly but 
then rebounded significantly. Its February aver -
age was 1¼% above that for January. Despite 
heightened geopolitical tensions, prices have 
fallen in March so far. As this report went to 
press, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at 
only US$105¾. The discount on crude oil fu -
tures stood at US$2 for deliveries six months ahead and US$4¼ for purchases 12 months 
ahead.
Import prices in January fell considerably on the 
month after seasonal adjustment, after previ -
ously rising slightly. This was attributable in 
large part to a steep decline in energy import 
prices following the month- on- month decline 
in Brent crude oil prices. In addition, purchase 
prices for other goods decreased, which should 
be seen in connection with the major euro ap-
preciation in the previous month. To a lesser 
extent, a similar pattern is visible in the case of industrial producer prices for domestic sales. In 
January import prices were down by 2.3% on 
the year, and producer prices down by 1.1%. The negative year- on- year change in producer 
prices narrowed to -0.9% in February.
Consumer prices in February increased slightly 
by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% on the month. 
Although energy prices picked up again on the 
heels of crude oil prices, food prices slipped 
somewhat from their high level. The prices of 
industrial goods and services, as well as hous -
ing rents, maintained their moderately rising 
trend. Annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) infla-tion fell from 1.3% in January to 1.2% in Febru-
ary, with the figure for the harmonised index 
falling from 1.2% to 1.0%.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
According to preliminary figures, the statutory 
health insurance institutions and health insur -
ance fund combined recorded a surplus of just 
over €1½ billion in 2013. However, the final 
 result for the year is likely to be almost €1 bil-
lion higher because the foreseeable obligations 
for a number of health insurance institutions,  resulting from a revision of the risk structure 
equalisation scheme, have already been 
booked, but the corresponding claims for the 
beneficiary health insurance institutions have 
not yet been recorded in the preliminary results 
for precautionary reasons. The substantial de -
terioration vis- à- vis the surplus of €9 billion re-
corded in 2012 is chiefly attributable to discre-
tionary interventions such as the €2½ billion cut to the central government grant and the 
abolition of the surgery visit charge (around €2 
billion), which was previously deducted from 
expenditure. The health insurance fund’s sur -
plus fell from €3½ billion in 2012 to €½ billion. Unemployment

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

The health insurance institutions also experi -
enced a very clear deterioration in results, with 
their surplus falling to just over €1 billion, al -
though the final outturn is likely to be higher 
due to the reasons outlined above. Overall, rev-
enue was up by only 1½% (or 2% if the out -
standing claims are included in the calcula -
tions), while growth in expenditure doubled on 
the year to 5½%.
The health insurance institutions’ main source 
of revenue is the predetermined monthly trans-fers from the health insurance fund. These rose by 3½% in 2013. Growth in expenditure accel-
erated considerably from just over 2½% in 
2012 to almost 5½% in 2013. There was once 
again a particularly steep increase in spending 
on out- patient medical and dental treatment 
(+10%), following the abolition of the surgery 
visit charge at the beginning of 2013. Without 
this effect, expenditure on these items would 
have still risen by 4½%. Spending on hospital 
treatment also increased at a much faster pace (almost 4½%) than in previous years, partly as a result of higher per capita in- patient charges 
and the health insurance institutions’ one- off 
assumption of a greater share of hospitals’ in-
creased personnel costs. At just over 2½%, after several years of declines or weaker growth, there was a distinct rise in payments for pharmaceuticals, in particular due to a 
surge towards the end of the year.
The health insurance fund’s transfers to the 
health insurance institutions went up by 3½%, 
but its revenue only increased by just under 
2%. At almost 3½%, contribution receipts con-
tinued to rise at a relatively strong pace as a result of the ongoing favourable employment 
and wage developments. However, growth in 
revenue was muted by a €2½ billion cut to the central government grant (to €11½ billion).
The financial situation of the statutory health 
insurance scheme is set to deteriorate consider -
ably in 2014 and the health insurance fund, in 
particular, is likely to record a larger deficit. In 
addition to the fact that expenditure is tending 
to increase at a faster pace than income sub -
ject to compulsory insurance contributions, the 
Act Accompanying the Budget (Haushaltsbe -
gleitgesetz) envisages a further cut to the cen-
tral government grant, down to €10½ billion. 
Moreover, the mandatory discounts for manu-
facturers of pharmaceuticals, which had been 
extended considerably on 1 August 2010, are 
to be almost completely reversed. As a result, 
this item is expected to record much larger rises 
in expenditure again. Finally, a number of health insurance institutions have already an
-
nounced higher premium payouts for their 
members.
The central government grant is to be put back 
up in 2015, but only to €11½ billion. The in -
crease to €14 billion, which had been on the 
cards, is now not scheduled to take place until 
2016. As of 2017, the grant is set to amount to 
€14½ billion per year. If central government 
funds are actually raised, the cuts would mean a notable, but only temporary, improvement in Sharp growth

the central government budget (which is, how-
ever, deemed to be structural in line with the 
provisions of the debt brake enshrined in Ger -
many’s constitution). In principle, it appears ap-
propriate to base the size of central govern -
ment’s transfers to the social security funds on 
the level of non- insurance- related benefits, 
which are for tasks facing society as a whole 
and should thus not be shouldered by insurees. 
It would therefore be helpful if the social secur -
ity funds’ core tasks were defined more clearly 
and if there were rules outlining how transfers are to be adjusted in line with growth of non- insurance- related benefits. While the classifica-
tion may be subject to debate in individual cases, it would enable central government to explicitly identify non- insurance- related bene
-
fits, thus providing a sound basis for discussion and decision- making.
Under the Act to improve the financial struc -
ture and the quality of the statutory health  insurance scheme (GKV- Finanzstruktur- und 
Qualitäts-  Weiterentwicklungsgesetz), the non-  
income- related additional contribution charged 
by individual health insurance institutions is to 
be abolished before it has been used on a wider scale. In its place, the uniform special contribution of 0.9% (hitherto paid solely by 
employees) is initially to be abolished and the 
health insurance institutions are then to deter -
mine the amount required depending on their 
individual financing needs. Any preferential or 
detrimental treatment arising for one health  insurance institution, with members earning 
above or below- average wages, is to be pre
-
vented by a full equalisation of revenue. The previous objective of partially shifting the in
-
come redistribution function to the tax and transfer system, which lay behind the non-  
 income-  related additional contribution and 
central government financing of the resultant 
social equalisation, is thus no longer being 
 pursued.Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
In 2013, the public long- term care insurance 
scheme recorded a surplus of just over €½ bil-lion, as expected. Following the increase in the contribution rate from 1.95% to 2.05% (plus an extra 0.25% in each case for childless persons), 
revenue rose by 8%. After adjustment for the 
contribution rate going up, this rise still amounted to just over 3%. Following the in
-
crease in nursing benefits, particularly those for 
individuals suffering from dementia, expend -
iture rose at a very strong pace (just over 6%), 
but was not as fast as growth in revenue. As a 
result, reserves were topped up to just over €6 
billion.
The grand coalition has agreed on a further in-
crease in nursing benefits. As of 2015, the con-
tribution rate is thus to be raised gradually by 
0.5 percentage point overall. 0.4 percentage Objective of

point thereof is to be used directly to fund cur -
rent expenditure and the contribution receipts 
generated from the remaining 0.1 percentage 
point are initially earmarked for a reserve 
(which will be managed by the Bundesbank). The increase in benefits will place an even larger strain on future generations because a contracting number of those employees who are particularly relevant for contribution re
-
ceipts will have to finance the majority of bene-
fits for a growing number of beneficiaries. By building up a reserve, today’s contribution payers have to pay more, but this will reduce the additional burden on future contribution payers. However, once the financial reserves have been exhausted, higher expenditure will have to be financed by continuously higher 
contributions. To what extent contributions can actually be evened out in this way depends on 
further policy responses. In particular, experi -
ence to date has shown that reserves for social 
security funds appear to be something of a 
temptation for policymakers, either to increase expenditure on benefits or to finance central 
government projects. Doubt pertaining to the 
sustainability of collective asset accumulation 
under government control seems all the more 
merited the looser the definition of the pur -
pose of the reserves.
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market 
picked up again in January 2014. Overall, bonds 
worth €151.3 billion were issued, compared 
with €95.2 billion in December 2013. After de-
ducting redemptions, which also increased on 
the previous month, and taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the volume of outstanding domestic bonds increased moderately by €2.5 billion. Foreign debt securities worth €3.6 billion net were placed on the German bond market, so that total sales of debt securities in January 
amounted to €6.1 billion.
In the reporting month, credit institutions 
raised their capital market debt (by €3.7 billion 
net) for the first time since February 2013. On 
balance, this was predominantly attributable to debt securities issued by specialised credit insti-tutions, the outstanding volume of which rose by €14.6 billion. Furthermore, a smaller amount 
(€1.3 billion) of mortgage Pfandbriefe were 
also issued. By contrast, public Pfandbriefe and “other bank debt securities” that can be struc-
tured flexibly were redeemed (€6.3 billion and 
€5.8 billion respectively).
Domestic enterprises issued corporate bonds 
with a net value of €3.5 billion in January, com-
pared with a redemption of €5.0 billion one 
month earlier. These new issues solely involved paper with a maturity of less than one year.
By contrast, as in the previous month, the pub-
lic sector redeemed own debt securities of €4.7 billion net (December 2013: €10.1 billion). Cap-Moderate in-

ital market debt was cut by state governments 
only (by €6.2 billion net). Central government 
debt, on the other hand, was up by €1.5 billion 
net. It issued mainly five-  year Federal notes 
( BobIs) worth €5.2 billion and two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze) worth €4.8 billion. At 
the same time, it redeemed ten- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) and Federal Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills) totalling €6.6 billion and €3.0 
billion net respectively.
Non- resident investors were the main net 
buyers on the German bond market, adding €11.3 billion worth of debt securities to their portfolios. By contrast, German credit institu
-
tions divested bonds worth €4.1 billion net. The Bundesbank’s holdings of debt securities 
fell by €1.5 billion.
Equity market
There was virtually no issuing activity in the 
German equity market in January. Listed com -
panies issued only €0.1 billion worth of shares overall. By contrast, the outstanding volume of 
foreign shares rose significantly, climbing by 
€3.6 billion on balance. German credit institu -
tions and domestic non- banks purchased equi-
ties for €8.6 billion and €2.7 billion net respect-
ively. By contrast, foreign investors reduced

In the reporting month, domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of €4.6 billion, €3.9 billion of which were to specialised funds reserved for in-stitutional investors. Of the asset classes, bond funds in particular sold shares (€2.5 billion). By 
contrast, equity funds redeemed shares (€0.9 billion on balance). In January, foreign invest
-
ment companies sold shares worth €2.4 billion 
in the German market. As in the previous month, mutual fund shares were purchased 
 almost exclusively by domestic non- banks (€6.7 
billion) and, to a minor extent, by non- resident investors (€0.7 billion). German credit institu -
tions sold fund shares worth €0.4 billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €16.2 billion in 
January 2014. The result was €4.9 billion below 
the level of the previous month. This was at -
tributable to a strong decline in the surplus in 
invisible current transactions, which exceeded 
the expansion in the trade surplus.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in January the foreign 
trade surplus went up by €1.2 billion on the month to €15.0 billion. After adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar variations, it decreased 
by €1.1 billion to €17.2 billion. The month- on- 
month percentage increase in the value of im-ports (+4.1%) was clearly stronger than that for 
exports (+2.2%). After seasonal adjustment, Bulk of pur-

nominal imports increased by 2.7% and ex -
ports by 1.7% on the final quarter of 2013.
In January, Germany recorded a surplus of €3.4 
billion in invisible current transactions, com -
pared with €11.1 billion one month earlier. This 
reflected a deterioration in all three sub-  
accounts. The deficit in current transfers grew 
by €2.8 billion to €4.7 billion. This was due pri-
marily to the strong inflow of payments from 
the EU budget at the end of the year. Net 
cross- border income declined by €2.4 billion to 
€6.2 billion in January. This was mainly attribut-able to lower income from foreign mutual fund 
shares and higher dividend payments to non-  
residents. The surplus in the services account 
contracted by €2.5 billion to €1.9 billion.
With financial market activity mainly quiet for 
much of the time, German cross-  border port -
folio investment resulted in net capital exports 
of €3.9 billion in January. Temporary tensions on the financial markets of some emerging market economies at the end of the month 
had no discernible impact. The increase in resi-
dents‘ investments abroad (€8.4 billion) con -
tributed to this development. Foreign investors 
stepped up their portfolio investment in Ger -
many by €4.4 billion.
German investors purchased mainly foreign debt securities (€3.6 billion). In addition, they 
acquired shares and mutual fund shares (€2.4 
billion in each case). Foreign investors bought 
– mainly short- term – debt securities issued by 
residents (€11.3 billion). By contrast, they dis -
posed of German shares (€7.6 billion).
Direct investment also generated net capital 
exports in January (€9.6 billion). The fact that 
resident firms provided their foreign affiliates 
with €6.8 billion in funding played a key role in 
this development, with capital injections (€4.7 
billion) and reinvested earnings (€4.2 billion) also playing a major role. In January, foreign 
enterprises withdrew €2.7 billion, mainly in the 
form of short- term financial loans, from their 
subsidiaries in Germany.Sharp contrac-

The shadow banking system in the euro 
area: overview and monetary policy implications
From an economic perspective, one of the financial system’s key tasks is to provide the non-  
financial sector with suitable options for financing and for acquiring financial assets. This inter-
mediary role is increasingly also being performed by what is known as the shadow banking 
 system, ie by financial enterprises that operate outside the regular commercial banking system. 
This includes entities such as special purpose vehicles and funds (money market, investment and hedge funds). In addition, specific activities (including securitisation and securities financing trans-actions) are also part of the shadow banking system.
The increased importance of shadow banking entities is often analysed from a financial stability 
perspective. However, it is also relevant from a monetary policy standpoint, because it touches on the realm of monetary analysis on the one hand and because it can impact on the effectiveness 
of monetary policy measures on the other. For instance, the provision of bank- like services by 
shadow banking entities or greater interaction between shadow banks and commercial banks 
may imply an incomplete or distorted representation of the money and credit supply, which is 
relevant for assessing economic activity and developments in goods prices. So far, the Euro-
system’s monetary analysis has addressed the risk that increased shadow banking activity could reduce the information content of monetary indicators by incorporating selected shadow banking entities (money market funds) into the calculation of monetary aggregates and by adjusting these aggregates for certain transactions (eg securitisation). These corrections – in combination with a 
more detailed analysis of sectoral shifts in money holdings – currently ensure that the data on 
monetary aggregates are sufficiently meaningful.
Given the financial sector’s central role in the transmission of monetary policy, the increased 
importance of shadow banks could, in principle, also change the way in which monetary policy works. As the corresponding research for the euro area is still in its infancy – which is probably due in part to the still insufficient statistical coverage of the shadow banking system – consider-ation can only be given to a number of conceptual issues. The increase in shadow banking activ-
ity is likely to broaden the non- financial sector’s range of financing and investment options, 
which, per se, tends to weaken the transmission of monetary policy measures via commercial 
banks. Yet by the same token, increased shadow banking activity also implies that market- based 
variables, in particular asset prices, play a more central role in the monetary policy transmission process, which, taken in isolation, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy measures. Over-
all, then, it is not necessarily a foregone conclusion that the increased importance of shadow 
banks weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy; it does, however, change the relative import -
ance of individual transmission channels.Deutsche Bundesbank

Monetary policy in a chan-
ging financial environment
Financial systems have always been in a state 
of flux. Increasing securitisation activity and a 
move towards shorter- term and more market- 
based financing were observable in the run- up 
to the global financial and economic crisis. 
More and more of commercial banks’ activities 
were carried out in conjunction with other 
 financial enterprises. This had the effect that 
the provision of finance to the real economy, which is of particular interest from an eco
-
nomic point of view, increasingly involved a 
host of entities and financial activities that op-erated outside the regular commercial banking system, in what is known as the shadow bank-ing system.
1
The outbreak of the financial and economic cri-
sis clearly illustrated that these developments 
have implications for financial stability. For ex-
ample, the ties between shadow and commer -
cial banks heighten the risk of contagion. 
Moreover, the shadow banking system appears 
to act procyclically, which might contribute to 
amplifying financial and economic cycles. 
Against this backdrop, regulators have directed 
more of their attention to monitoring and regulating shadow banks. At present, these 
two aspects are being pushed ahead as part of a coordinated international effort between the Financial Stability Board and the European Sys-temic Risk Board and implemented at the Euro-pean level by the European Commission.
2
However, the shadow banking system’s grow -
ing importance also has implications for mon -
etary policy as it affects the information con -
tent of monetary policy indicators and can 
 impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy 
measures. Against this backdrop, this article 
first offers an overview of the shadow banking 
system before outlining the statistical and ana-lytical challenges associated with this develop-ment. Of notable importance from a monetary 
policy perspective is the extent to which the 
shadow banking system touches on the realm of monetary analysis and how it could impact 
on monetary policy transmission.

The shadow banking system in the flow of funds
The macroeconomic flow of funds shows to 
what extent and in what form which sectors in 
an economy provide (acquisition of financial 
assets) and draw (financing) financial resources. 
The non- financial sector – above all non-  
financial enterprises and households – is of 
 particular interest in this context as it is the 
 ultimate aim of the financial system as a whole, 
from an economic perspective, to provide this 
sector, via financial intermediation, with suit -
able options for financing on the one hand and 
for the acquisition of financial assets on the 
other (see the chart on page 17). As part of the 
financial intermediation process, the financial 
system transforms maturities, liquidity, credit 
risk and lot size in the provision of debt finan-cing, which is known as credit intermediation.
3 
The objective of this transformation process is, first, to offer, as far as possible, callable, liquid, 
low- risk and small-  scale investment options to 
suit investors’ preferences and, second, to pro-vide the non- financial sector with a sufficiently Growing ties

sector
1 A glance into the economic history books shows that the 
shadow banking system is not a new phenomenon. Over 
time, intermediation segments have regularly emerged and 
been taken over by non- bank financial intermediaries, with 
new financial products also being used to expand lending 
business. See R S Thorn (1958), Nonbank Financial Inter -
mediaries, Credit Expansion and Monetary Policy, IMF Staff Papers, 6, pp 396-383.

high volume of low- liquidity, risk- bearing fund-
ing with the longest possible maturity.
Traditionally, this role is played by commercial 
banks, in particular by providing mostly long-  
term loans to the non- financial sector and by 
creating liquid sight deposits. Commercial 
banks are ideally suited to performing this role 
seeing that their ability to create deposit money 
gives them a high degree of flexibility. The  acceptance of deposit money is substantially 
supported by the deposit guarantee scheme, 
regulatory requirements and commercial banks’ 
access to central bank liquidity, the latter also 
being the point at which commercial banks are addressed by monetary policy instruments.
Besides commercial banks, what are known as 
non- bank financial intermediaries, too, act as 
financial intermediaries when it comes to pro -
viding financing and the acquisition of financial 
assets as part of the financial intermediation 
process. The shadow banking system forms 
part of this sector and essentially comprises all 
entities and activities involved in credit inter -
mediation outside the regular commercial banking system.
4 These include, for instance, 
certain activities of special purpose vehicles, funds (money market, investment and hedge 
funds), securities traders, financing vehicles and insurers (see the box on page 18).Shadow banks are fundamentally different from commercial banks in several respects.  Unlike commercial banks, shadow banks are 
unable to create deposit money, nor do they have direct access to central bank liquidity. 
Hence, they are generally more exposed to the 
threat of short- term liquidity fluctuations. On 
top of this, shadow banks’ liabilities do not 
 enjoy the same level of government protection 
as commercial banks’ deposits. Lastly, the regu-lation of shadow banks is a great deal less ex-tensive, broadly speaking, compared with that 
of commercial banks, even though country-  
specific and supranational requirements are al-ready in place and being constantly refined for isolated shadow banking entities and activities.
In order to perform the transformation desired 
by the non- financial sector despite the differ -
ences to the commercial banking sector, trans-
actions carried out by shadow banking system entities exhibit a range of special features.

Selected shadow banking system entities and activities
The shadow banking system comprises all 
entities and activities that are involved in credit intermediation outside  the regular 
commercial banking system. This box briefl  y describes some typical examples.
1
Financing vehicles
Financing vehicles specialise in real estate, 
consumer and investment loans (eg in the 
form of automotive banks). These special-
ised credit institutions also carry out leasing 
and factoring business. However, unlike commercial banks, fi  nancing vehicles do not conduct deposit business – they fund 
themselves primarily via the capital market 
or through commercial banks.
Special- purpose vehicles
Special- purpose vehicles (SPVs) generally 
provide structured fi  nance that is tailored to 
specifi  c economic and legal circumstances.2 
They mainly comprise fi  nancial vehicle cor-
porations (special investment vehicles, ABCP 
conduits), which buy receivables (including 
loans) from commercial banks or fi  nancing 
vehicles and bundle them in a portfolio. These receivables act as collateral for the 
debt securities with differing maturities that these institutions issue to fund themselves.
3
Investment funds
Investment funds raise capital by issuing 
mutual fund shares and invest this capital in assets.
– 
Fund shares issued by money market 
funds are typically viewed by investors as 
an alternative to traditional bank deposits, 
as the perception is that they can be  liquidated at any time with little risk of 
loss. Money market funds invest the funds 
they receive in short- term and secured  fi  nancial transactions with other institu-
tional investors and commercial banks.
– Other investment funds are involved in credit intermediation, for instance, through the purchase of securitised 
assets. In some euro- area countries, they 
are also authorised to lend directly to 
households and enterprises.
– Hedge funds invest, inter alia, in struc-
tured products, if necessary using exten-sive leverage, which allows them to gen-erate comparatively high yields, but also involves large risks. They are also  active, 
amongst other things, in the market for 
credit default swaps (CDSs).
Insurance corporations and pension funds
Insurance corporations and pension funds 
(ICPF) also invest the funds they receive in 
the form of their customers’ premium pay-
ments in structured fi  nancial instruments, but are subject to regulatory constraints.  Insurance corporations may offer direct loans and are involved in the transfer of  liquidity (eg via liquidity swap agreements with other fi  nancial intermediaries) and 
credit risk (eg in the form of mortgage in-
surance). In addition, insurance corpor-ations – like pension funds, investment funds, securities traders and other institu-
tional investors – carry out secured refi  nan-
cing operations (repo transactions and 
 securities lending).4
1 See Financial Stability Board (2011), Shadow Bank-
ing: Scoping the Issues. The explanations here are 
highly simplifi  ed and abridged. For a detailed represen-
tation of the individual entities and activities in the 
shadow banking system, see Z Poszar, T Adrian, A Ash-
craft and H Boesky (2013), Economic Policy Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 19(2), pp 1-16.2 An SPV is established between creditor and debtor in 
order to provide legal protection to the debtor from 
liability to the creditor in the event of payment diffi   cul-
ties. SPVs’ activities include securitisations as well as, 
for instance, large project fi  nancing and acquisition 
 fi  nancing.3 See European Central Bank, Securitisation in the euro area, Monthly Bulletin, February 2008, pp 81-94.
4 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The fi  nancial system in 
transition: the new importance of repo markets, 
Monthly Report, December 2013, pp 57-71.Deutsche Bundesbank

market- based.5 This facilitates maturity and 
liquidity transformation as these entities 
 invest in long- term and low- liquidity, credit- 
based assets on the one hand and are never -
theless able to offer forms of investment 
which are tradable and thus easier to con -
vert into cash and available at short notice, 
on the other hand.
– Their financing instruments are more fund-  
based. Issuing fund shares enables them to 
offer large- scale loans, while also meeting 
small- scale investor’s requirements.
– Finally, transactions are secured to a larger 
extent. This allows shadow banks to trans -
form and separate credit risk, as does the 
increased use of derivative instruments.
On balance, this tends to lead to long inter -
mediation chains because the transformation 
process is spread over a range of activities and 
entities specialising in individual aspects of 
transformation.
Moreover, the shadow banking system has 
close ties with the commercial banking sector. For example, commercial banks purchase debt securities issued by special purpose entities, ex-tend credit lines to entities in the shadow bank-ing system or are connected to shadow bank-
ing entities, in particular money market funds 
and other institutional investors, through their 
own refinancing activities.
Statistical coverage of the 
shadow banking system in  the euro area
The highly heterogeneous nature of shadow 
banking entities, activities and instruments makes 
it difficult to capture them for statistical pur -
poses. Unlike in the commercial banking sector 
with its very good statistical coverage, there are 
no clearly defined, consistent statistics for the 
shadow banking system in the euro area as a 
whole that fully cover all its entities and activities.The financial accounts can be used as a first 
step towards statistically approximating the 
shadow banking system. These accounts allow financial intermediaries to be broken down into commercial banks and non- bank financial inter -
mediaries. The latter can again be divided into 
insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs) and into what are known as other 
 financial intermediaries (OFIs).6
With the aid of additional statistical data, it is 
possible to distinguish between financial  vehicle 
corporations, money market funds and what 
are known as other investment funds (ie invest-
ment funds other than money market funds) 
within the group of OFIs. There are no statistics 
allowing a similar presentation of the remain -
ing OFIs (ie other miscellaneous intermediar -
ies).7 These entities are recorded in the financial 
accounts, but only as an aggregate and include 
financing vehicles (providers of consumer credit and loans for house purchase), financial leasing 
 institutions, venture capital companies and 
 securities traders.
While it is true that this broad approach cap -
tures all financial intermediaries that are en -
gaged in principle in shadow banking activities, 
it does tend to overstate the shadow banking 
system given that it also includes financial inter -
mediaries and activities which are primarily en-
gaged in credit intermediation only sporadically 
or not at all. This applies, among others, to 
pure equity- based funds8 or equity traders. In -

5 Hence, the shadow banking system can alternatively also be referred to as a system of market- based financial inter -
mediation, as the entities involved fund their operations 
primarily through money and capital- market- based instru -
ments. See T Adrian and H S Shin (2009), Money, Liquidity, and Monetary Policy, American Economic Review: Papers & Proceedings, 99, 2, pp 600-605.
6 In this section, the OFI sector also comprises money 
 market funds.7 See also European Central Bank, Enhancing the monitor -
ing of shadow banking, Monthly Bulletin, February 2013, 
pp 90-99.8 However, as long as pure equity- based funds are involved 
in securities financing transactions, they remain a part of 
credit intermediation in the shadow banking system.Deutsche Bundesbank

and the associated transformation owing to 
their exposure to shares and the structure of 
their liabilities in the form of low-liquidity and 
long- term claims on insurance corporations 
and pension funds.
The increased importance of 
the shadow banking system
Given that such a functional focus on credit 
intermediation is statistically impracticable, the 
shadow banking system is approximated in the following using a broad approach based on the 
sector of non- bank financial intermediaries.9 
The importance of this sector in the process of 
financial intermediation for the non- financial 
sector has increased perceptibly over the past 
years. The share of non- bank financial inter -
mediaries in the aggregate total assets of the 
entire euro- area financial sector increased sig -
nificantly between 1999 and 2013. This in -
crease was driven by the build- up of financial 
assets in the OFI sector. This in turn is primarily 
attributable to investment funds other than money market funds and to other miscellan
-
eous intermediaries, which cannot be identified 
separately. Whereas the importance of non-  
bank financial intermediaries increased, the sig-
nificance of the commercial banking sector di-
minished, in particular following the onset of the crisis. The necessary balance sheet repair in 
the commercial banking sector is likely to have been a contributing factor in this regard.
From an economic perspective, the liabilities 
and claims of non- bank financial intermediaries 
vis- à- vis the non- financial private sector (ie 
non- financial corporations and households) are 
of particular interest in this context. However, 
the aggregate statistics currently available for the euro area unfortunately do not paint a complete picture of these creditor- debtor 
(who-to-whom) relationships. There are not
-
ably gaps in the securities data – financial ac -
counts data only include the securities portfolio 
of non- bank financial intermediaries as a 
whole. Thus far, it has not been possible to separately present the relationships with the 
non- financial private sector or the holdings of 
securities issued by commercial banks.Importance of

9 In its attempt to monitor the shadow banking system, 
the Financial Stability Board, too, initially uses a broad 
measure to capture credit intermediation outside the com-
mercial banking sector. Owing to the fact that the ap -
proach is not focused on monetary policy but on financial 
stability, the financial assets of the OFI sector are con -
sidered. Subsequently, the focus shifts to those entities and 
activities that could represent a systemic risk to the finan -
cial system or that ought to be examined more closely 
against the background of regulatory arbitrage. See Finan-

International comparison of fi  nancial system structures – 
 selected country results
A comparison of the fi  nancial systems in the 
United States and the euro area on the 
basis of fi  nancial intermediaries’ fi  nancial assets illustrates that the relative import-
ance of non- bank fi  nancial intermediaries is 
lower in the euro area than in the United 
States. Whereas in the United States other 
fi  nancial intermediaries (OFIs, including money market funds) have, since 1999, consistently accounted for well over 40% of these assets and commercial banks for around 20%, the euro area’s commercial banks have managed well over 50% of 
assets in some cases.
However, it should be noted that the separ-
ation of banking activities in the United 
States means that the OFI sector is larger owing to the legal situation alone. Under the universal banking system in the euro 
area by contrast, many entities whose activ-ities can in part be attributed to the shadow banking system are not counted as OFIs but as commercial banks.
In the United States, growth in fi  nancial intermediaries’ total assets was mainly driven by OFIs in the run- up to the crisis. Their importance has since waned, how-
ever. In the euro area, by contrast, OFIs only 
started noticeably gaining importance rela-
tive to commercial banks once the crisis had reached its peak. Overall, commercial banks 
in the euro area nevertheless contributed far more to th e growth in fi  nancial inter-
mediaries than in the United States. The fi  -
nancial assets of insurance corporations 
and pension funds exhibited largely steady 
growth in both regions throughout the 
period under review.

By contrast, more granular data are available 
on loans, allowing for an examination of who- 
to- whom relationships. The data show that 
while growth in overall loans to the non-  
financial private sector in the euro area con -
tinued to be dominated by commercial banks 
(see the chart on page 23), OFI lending grew at 
a faster pace than that of commercial banks – 
particularly in combination with the  increased 
securitisation activity between 2006 and 2009. 
Since 2012, loans issued by other miscellan -
eous intermediaries, which count as OFIs, have been a key financing alternative for households 
and non- financial corporations.10 At present, 
OFIs are therefore making a positive contribu -
tion to the growth in loans. However, their 
contribution is not sufficient to compensate for 
the negative development observed in the 
commercial banking sector.Investment behaviour and 
 external financing of other 
 financial intermediaries
The chart on page 24 shows the detailed struc-
ture of OFIs’ external financing and investment 
behaviour. It is noticeable that a large overall 
share in external financing is made up of shares issued by money market and other investment funds. The latter use the funds raised primarily 
for investing in debt  securities and equity. 
Whereas the majority of issuers of debt secur -
ities are located in the euro area, portfolio … and very 
 dynamic in terms of loans
Large share  
of investment funds in OFI  sector, …However, the data on the euro area as a 
whole masks an at times very uneven distri-
bution of the assets under management 
across the individual member states. This is 
because the tax system in particular offers 
some countries considerable advantages as 
a fi  nancial location, which are in turn re-
inforced by the resulting economies of scale 
(data refer to the third quarter of 2013).
– Half the euro- area OFIs’ fi  nancial assets 
are held by OFIs in Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands alone (32% and 18% re-
spectively).
– Luxembourg’s major importance is 
largely attributable to other investment funds (35%, all investment funds other than money market funds), including 
bond and share- based funds in particu-
lar. At 18% of assets, other investment 
funds are also relatively important in Ger-many.– Virtually all money market fund assets in 
the euro area are managed in France (39%), Ireland (33%) and Luxembourg 
(24%).
– Just under 75% of all assets under man-
agement by fi  nancial vehicle corpor-ations in the euro area are held in Ire-land, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, which is linked amongst others to the 
developments in the real estate markets 
in those countries prior to the fi  nancial 
crisis.1
– Almost 60% of assets managed by insur-ance corporations and pension funds are held in Germany and France (28% each), which can be explained, inter alia, by the 
effects of the age structure on savings behaviour and the way in which social 
security systems are set up.

tisation markets in the euro area and at country level,

10 Intra-  sector lending in the non-  financial corporations 
sector (including intra- group loans in particular) is not 
taken into account in these calculations. This was a key  alternative source of financing to bank loans particularly 
during the financial and economic crisis; see ESCB Task Force (2013), Corporate finance and economic activity in the euro area, Occasional Paper Series, European Central 
Bank, No 151.Deutsche Bundesbank

equity is mainly issued by non- financial corpor -
ations within and outside the euro area.11
The development of money market funds, 
which are not presented separately, has been 
strongly affected by the financial and economic crisis.
12 Their total assets have diminished sub-
stantially because major downside risks in their portfolios combined with weak returns in a set-ting of low short- term rates caused investors to 
withdraw massive sums of cash. A look at their assets reveals that money market funds primar -
ily hold short- term debt securities, the bulk of 
which were issued by commercial banks and, 
to a lesser extent, by non- financial corporations 
and euro- area member states.13 Money market 
funds are also involved in the financing of com-
mercial banks in the form of deposit business 
(including repo activities).14 Overall, this dem -
onstrates the very close ties between money 
market funds and commercial banks.
Besides investing in equity and debt securities, 
OFIs primarily grant loans. This is being driven 
both by other miscellaneous intermediaries 
– particularly of late as mentioned above – and 
by financial vehicle corporations. However, the latter’s importance has clearly diminished in the course of the financial and economic crisis as a 
result of the slump in securitisation business, which is probably related to the heightened 
uncertainty surrounding the valuation of these 
securitised loans. Moreover, a substantial part 
of the remaining issuance is currently being 
used as collateral by commercial banks in Euro-system refinancing operations.
Shadow banking system and 
financial system efficiency
Generally, the specialisation in the shadow 
banking system facilitates a more efficient rec-
onciliation of financing needs and the provision of funds. From this perspective, shadow banks 
contribute to rounding out the financial sys -
tem, benefiting the non- financial sector in 
terms of improved investment and financing. If the commercial banking system encounters 
short-  lived bottlenecks in the supply of credit, 
this can stabilise the macroeconomic flow of 
funds while at the same time allowing risks to 
be diversified outside the commercial banking … with money 
market funds continuing to be closely intercon-nected with commercial banks despite massive  outflows

sector as well.15 In this way, the activities of the 
shadow banking system – taken in isolation – 
improve the supply of funds within the finan -
cial system as long as this does not pose a 
threat to financial stability. The risk to financial 
stability can be addressed using macropruden-
tial instruments, which can be geared to con-
taining systemic risks in the cross- sectional 
 dimension (interconnectedness) and in the time 
dimension (procyclicality). Principles such as 
proportionality, accuracy and adaptability should prevail when these instruments are 
 deployed.Despite the difficulties associated with the stat-istical coverage of the shadow banking system, 
it is broadly evident that credit intermediation 
via the shadow banking system has gained  importance since the beginning of European 
monetary union (EMU). This is likely to be at 
least partly attributable to the activities of the 
shadow banking system being less regulated, 
which is to be viewed critically from a financial 
stability perspective.16 Another likely factor is 
the growing demand on the part of globally active investment companies, insurance cor
-
porations and pension funds as well as large 
non- financial corporations for forms of invest-
ment that represent an alternative to bank de-
posits, particularly in the short-  term segment, 
and which are provided by shadow banks (inter 
alia via money market fund shares and short-  
term secured debt securities).17
The shadow banking system 
from a monetary policy standpoint
Importance of the shadow banking system for monetary analysis
The analysis of monetary and credit aggregates 
occupies a prominent role in the Eurosystem’s 
monetary policy strategy. This is based on the 
experience that suitably defined monetary and 
credit aggregates can deliver information on 
developments in the real economy and on the 
medium to long- term risks to price stability. In 
a financial system dominated by commercial 
banks, the natural point of reference for defin-
ing these variables is the banking sector. Thus, 
the Eurosystem uses the consolidated balance Analysis of mon-
etary and credit aggregates to assess longer- term price risksInvestment behaviour and external financing of other financial intermediaries

sheet of the euro- area banking sector to calcu-
late various monetary aggregates (M1, M2, 
M3) and their counterparts.18
So far, this article has focused on the financing 
perspective. This angle emphasises shadow 
banks’ economic function of providing – to -
gether with commercial banks – investment 
and financing opportunities to the non- financial 
sector. By contrast, from a monetary policy 
standpoint, the focus is not on the provision of 
funds to the non- financial sector but on the 
money in circulation held by non- banks. Cor -
respondingly, monetary analysis distinguishes 
between banks as the money- issuing sector 
and non- banks as the money- holding sector. 
That is why, from a financing perspective, 
shadow banks – together with commercial 
banks – are classified as belonging to the finan-
cial sector, whereas from a monetary angle, they are regarded as being part of the non-  
banking sector along with the non- financial 
sector. Owing to this special role, shadow 
banks pose something of a challenge for ana -
lysts and statisticians.
This becomes particularly apparent for monet -
ary analysis when shadow banks’ activities im-
pair the information content of the monetary 
and credit- related indicators used to gauge de-
velopments in the real economy and the out -
look for prices (metrics which are traditionally 
calculated on the basis of commercial banks’ 
balance sheets).19 The impact is twofold.
– First, the growing importance of the shadow 
banking system could gradually shift the provision of liquid funds and the financing of the economy outside the commercial banking sector, resulting in the latter’s ser
-
vices being substituted.
– Second, shadow banks’ interactions with the commercial banking sector are all fac
-
tored into the monetary and credit aggre -
gates, as shadow banks are classified as 
non- banks in the banking statistics. Contrary 
to their statistical classification, some activ -ities between shadow banks and commer -
cial banks in particular might be assigned 
more to the activities of the money- issuing 
sector than the money- holding sector from 
an economic point of view.
Shadow banks as substitutes 
for commercial banks
Shadow banks’ role as financial intermediaries 
has led to these institutions assuming the func-
tion of alternative providers of short- term in -
vestments in the acquisition of financial assets 
for the non- financial sector through the issu -
ance of money market fund shares, say, or 
short- term collateralised securities. From a 
monetary analysis perspective, it should be 
checked, then, whether any of the liabilities is-sued by the shadow banking system substitute 
traditional bank deposits – that is, whether they are comparable, say, with the bank de
-
posits included in M3 in terms of their degree 
of liquidity and their risk characteristics.20 If this 
is the case, increasing shadow banking activity 
would diminish the meaningfulness of monet -
ary indicators, with the monetary aggregates needed for price determination in the goods market, in particular, being defined too nar
-
rowly.
That is why, in an ever- evolving financial sys -
tem, it is crucial to regularly review the defin -
itions of monetary aggregates. At the launch of 
EMU, the Eurosystem decided that the group of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) de
-
signed to capture the money-  issuing sector 
should include not just euro- area commercial Shadow banks 
as part of the  financial system and the non- banking sector

18 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The consolidated balance 
sheet of the MFI sector and its significance for monetary 
analysis, Monthly Report, July 2013, pp 55-56.19 Shadow banks’ activities could potentially also increase 
the information content if this meant that, for example, 
certain transactions by households and non- financial cor -
porations that were related more closely to prices of assets rather than of goods were no longer reflected in commer -
cial banks’ balance sheets.20 The extent to which these liabilities are used as money 
substitutes is subject to cyclical fluctuations and dependent on market developments.Deutsche Bundesbank

banks but money market funds as well, the 
 rationale for this move being that for investors, 
money market fund shares were close substi -
tutes for bank deposits in terms of liquidity and 
therefore, much like bank deposits, were likely to be related to spending decisions.
However, as monetary analysis is based on the 
consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector, 
the concept of balance sheet identity dictates 
that a corresponding counterpart must be 
entered for each newly added monetary vari -
able. So if the Eurosystem adds the liabilities side of money market funds’ balance sheets 
– that is, the issued money market fund shares – 
to the MFI sector’s consolidated balance sheet, it follows that the assets side of money market 
funds’ balance sheets likewise needs to be in -
cluded. This was relatively straightforward for money market funds because they could be 
subjected to reporting requirements and their 
business activities essentially confined to receiv-ing and investing fund assets (the latter primar -
ily in short- term near- bank investments).
Interaction between shadow 
banks and commercial banks
The increase in significance of the shadow 
banking system goes hand in hand with greater 
interaction between shadow banks and com -
mercial banks. While an unconsolidated analy-
sis of payment flows between the individual 
 financial sector players is of interest from a 
 financial stability perspective, monetary analysis 
seeks to adjust the monetary and credit aggre-gates affected by the interaction, if need be, so as to best capture the changes relevant to price developments.
21
Secured money market transactions known as 
repo and reverse repo transactions, which 
commercial banks conclude with central coun-
terparties (such as Eurex Clearing AG, which until recently was statistically classified as a 
non- bank financial intermediary), are examples 
of this. Repo transactions (reverse repo trans-actions) were originally presented in the bank-
ing statistics – which are crucial for monetary 
analysis – as an outflow (inflow) of funds for the money- holding sector. Yet for the most 
part, these transactions inherently constitute secured money market transactions between 
commercial banks in which the central counter -
party merely acts as a go-between. Conse -
quently, the money supply is not expanded at 
the macroeconomic level. These secured trans-
actions grew steadily in importance over the course of the financial and economic crisis owing to the high level of uncertainty in the interbank market. They ultimately had such a 
significant impact on short- term monetary and 
credit developments, both in terms of quantity 
and their month- on- month volatility (see the 
chart on page 27), that the Eurosystem decided 
to exclude them from the calculation of M3 
and its counterparts in August 2012.22
Loan sales and securitisation are further ex -
amples of the increasing interaction between the commercial and shadow banking systems 
and the impact they have on monetary analy -
sis. The sharp increase in lending to the euro-  
area non- financial private sector observed 
 before the onset of the financial and economic 
crisis was accompanied by large- scale securi -
tisation activity among commercial banks. 
Amongst other things, commercial banks trans-
ferred loans to securitisation vehicles with a 
view to shielding their regulatory capital. Given 
that commercial banks on the one hand and 
securitisation vehicles, which count as non-  
bank financial intermediaries, on the other are 
assigned to different sectors, loan sales and 
 securitisations of this kind are recorded in the 
banking statistics as a decline in the respective 
credit aggregate. However, the loans still exist 
from a financing perspective, which means that 
the borrowed funds can continue to be used 
on the expenditure side by the non-  financial Interaction

private sector. That is why it was in the interest 
of monetary analysis to take these sales and 
 securitisation activities into account – hence, 
since mid-2010 they have been subject to re -
porting  requirements and the monetary data 
can be adjusted accordingly.23
Sectoral shifts in money 
 holding and the relationship 
between money supply and the price level
Although the incomplete statistical coverage of 
shadow banking activities, particularly in the 
area of securities transactions, means that it is 
currently not possible to paint a detailed pic -
ture of the shadow banking system’s growth in 
significance since the launch of EMU in terms 
of the extent to which it substitutes commer -
cial bank activities as well as its direct inter -
action with commercial banks, the banking 
statistics at least provide granular information 
on the bank deposits held by non- bank finan -
cial intermediaries. Thus, the shadow banking 
system’s growing importance for financial 
intermediation since the launch of EMU has driven sectoral shifts in euro- area M3 hold
-
ings24 (see the chart on page 28). While non-  
financial corporations’ share of the broad 
money stock M3 in the euro area has remained relatively constant, the share of household de-
posits has diminished significantly on balance 
since 1999 despite continual growth. Nonethe-
less, at just under 64% at the current end, households still hold the bulk of deposits in
-
cluded in M3.25 By contrast, the share of M3 
deposits attributable to non-  bank financial 
intermediaries increased from 10% at the 
launch of EMU to 16% at the end of 2011, re-
flecting the expansion of the shadow banking 
system. However, their share of the broad 
money stock M3 has fallen back to just under 
12% of late. Besides the exclusion of repo transactions with central counterparties since mid-2010, which accounts for a significant 
amount, this probably also owes something to the fact that the easing of the financial markets prompted the professional investors that dom-
inate the shadow banking system to reduce their uncertainty- driven money holdings and 
invest once more in better remunerated invest-ment vehicles not covered by the monetary ag-gregates.
Both the increase before the crisis and the de-
cline in the last two years can be attributed for 
the most part to OFIs rather than to ICPFs. In Shadow banking

23 While MFI loan flows are adjusted for loan sales and

credit developments might be overstated.
24 Short- term bank debt securities are not taken into 
 account in the following because they cannot be broken 
down into sectoral holdings. Hence, the term money hold-
ing is confined here to M2 components (excluding cash) 
plus repo transactions.
25 Households generally hold a considerably larger share 
of their financial assets in bank deposits, particularly in M3 
deposits, than do enterprises and the public sector. The 
strong preference for liquidity reflects the relatively higher 
significance they attach to money holding for transactions 
in the goods and services market compared with other 
s ectors.Deutsche Bundesbank

the run- up to the financial and economic crisis, 
OFIs primarily stepped up their short- term time 
deposits, notably on account of the significant 
spread between sight and time deposits at that 
juncture (see the chart on page 29). Since the 
collapse of US investment bank Lehman Broth-ers at the end of 2008, heightened uncertainty 
distinctly increased the significance of  secured 
money market transactions (repos).
The sectoral shifts within the broad money 
stock M3 need to be accounted for in monet-ary analysis as they might alter the information 
content of monetary aggregates with respect 
to macroeconomic activity as well as develop -
ments in goods and asset prices over time. It is 
evident that developments in the deposits of non- bank financial intermediaries, which are 
dominated by professional portfolio consider
-
ations, exhibit a certain lead structure com -
pared with the investment behaviour of the 
non- financial private sector when the financial 
markets are in constant flux. At the current end, it is especially conceivable that the re -
newed appetite for risk, which led to the afore-
mentioned reduction of M3 deposits in the 
shadow banking system, will also spread to the other sectors with a certain time lag.
However, this will not necessarily entail a fur -
ther weakening of M3 growth, as it can gener -
ally be assumed that households’ and non-  
financial corporations’ money holdings are pre-
dominantly earmarked for consumption and investment. Households in particular respond relatively sluggishly to changes in the macro
-
economic setting when making investment de-
cisions, whereas non- financial corporations 
gear their decisions more strongly to the eco -
nomic cycle. This stands in contrast to the 
shadow banking system’s demand for money, 
which is less closely linked to demand for 
goods. Rather, asset prices play a more promin-
ent role owing to the more market-  based 
 financing instruments used by the shadow 
banking system and the widespread collaterali-
sation of transactions with securities, whose 
prices fluctuate over time.26
Monetary analysis therefore needs to consider 
that a persistently higher level of M3 holdings 
in the shadow banking system could affect the 
meaningfulness of monetary indicators. Thus, 
deposits which shadow banks hold in the com-
mercial banking sector typically respond far 
more strongly to changes in market develop -
ments than deposits held by non- financial sec-
tors. Moreover, the transactions concluded by 
shadow banks are influenced to a greater ex -
tent by the market setting. The fact that the 12-month rates of M3 deposits held by non-  
bank financial intermediaries have moved in a 
broader range and exhibited wider monthly 
fluctuations than those of non- financial corpor -
ations and households since the launch of EMU 
points in this direction. In terms of monetary … could change

analysis, the increased share of M3 deposits 
held by the interest-  r ate-  sensitive shadow  
banking system therefore also increases the 
overall short-  term volatility of the M3 aggre -
gate, which is something that needs to be ac -
counted for when assessing the underlying rate 
of monetary expansion.27
On top of this, the growing significance of the 
shadow banking system probably tends to im-
pair the extent to which growth in real M1 
holdings serves to indicate turning points in 
real economic activity because shadow banks’ 
money holdings are far less strongly connected 
with real economic dynamics than those of the 
non- financial private sector . The same can be 
said for the relationship between monetary ag -
gregates and consumer prices. While the non-  
financial private sector’s demand for money is 
more closely related to the real economy and 
to goods prices, the determinants of develop -
ments in shadow banks’ demand for money 
are more likely to be found in the realm of 
 financial market variables (see the box on 
pages 30 and 31). Hence, it can generally be said that they probably reinforce the relation -
ship between money growth and asset prices.
The shadow banking system 
and monetary policy trans­mission
The financial system is the key player in the 
transmission of monetary policy measures to 
the non-  financial sector’ s spending and pricing 
decisions. Monetary policy can be transmitted 
via a host of channels, some of which are inter -
linked. For example, monetary policy measures 
influence general interest rates and have a 
knock-  on effect on the non-  financial sector’ s 
demand for credit and its spending behaviour 
(interest rate channel). They can also affect the 
supply of bank loans (credit channel) and change financial intermediaries’ attitude to -
wards the assumption of risk (risk-  taking chan -
nel).28Hence, shifts in the relative significance of 
shadow and commercial banks can essentially 
also have an impact on the monetary policy 
transmission process in the euro area. How -
ever, whether or not this is the case cannot be 
conclusively proven at the current juncture – empirical research into this topic is still in its 
infancy, probably because the underlying statis-
tical data are largely underdeveloped at the 
present time.29
It is nonetheless possible to give consideration to a number of conceptual issues. As a source 
of financing, shadow banks are both a com -
plement to and a substitute for commercial 
banks.… and affects

A wavelet analysis on the determinants of developments 
in non- bank fi  nancial intermediaries’ deposits
The information to be gleaned from monet-
ary developments for monetary analysis can 
be impaired by the money holdings of shadow banks – which are, for statistical 
purposes, considered to belong to the non- 
monetary fi  nancial sector – if the relation-ship between the money holdings of the non- monetary sector and the macroeco-
nomic variables relevant to monetary policy 
systematically deviates from that for the 
non- fi  nancial sector.
Wavelet analysis, as it is known, can be used to gain an insight into the empirical relationship between the deposits of non- 
bank fi  nancial intermediaries and other vari-
ables.1 It allows changes in the empirical 
relationship between the variables under 
observation both over time and across the 
frequency spectrum (ie for fl  uctuations with periods of different lengths). The time series 
are modelled with the aid of a fl  exible mathematical function (known as a wave-let), which is stretched or compressed de-pending on the frequency under examin-
ation. Time variability is measured by estab-lishing the approximation for every point in 
time via a window of neighbouring obser-
vations, with the length of the window adapted to the frequency under observa-
tion. This method can therefore be used to 
analyse in what frequency areas the rela-tionship between the money holdings of 
non- bank fi  nancial intermediaries and other 
macroeconomic variables relevant to mon-
etary policy is located, and whether this 
 relationship has changed over time.
To this end, the empirical relationship be-
tween deposits by non- bank fi  nancial inter-
mediaries contained in M2 and, one by one, the gross domestic product, the har-monised index of consumer prices and a 
share price index (DJ Euro Stoxx) was ana-
lysed.2 For various frequencies and points in time, the share of the fl  uctuations in the annual growth rate of each of these vari-ables that can be explained by the fl  uctu-
ations in the annual growth rate of deposits (coherence) was estimated.
3 
– Statistically signifi  cant, time- stable coher-ence with the growth rate of the real or 
nominal deposits of non- bank fi  nancial 
intermediaries was found neither for the growth rate of real gross domestic prod-
uct nor for the infl  ation rate. Although 
there are a few signifi  cant coherences at 
low to medium frequencies, they only 
occur for limited periods. 
– There is, by contrast, a signifi  cant rela-
tionship between the annual growth rate 
of the deposit variables and that of the 
share price index for fl  uctuations with 
periods of between six and ten years (see 
1 For an introduction to wavelet analysis, see A Rua 
(2012), Wavelets in Economics, Economic Bulletin, 
Summer, Banco de Portugal, pp 71 ff; L Aguiar- Conraria 
and M J Soares (2013), The Continuous Wavelet Trans-
form: Moving Beyond Uni- and Bivariate Analyses, 
Journal of Economic Surveys, forthcoming. Compared to the conventional rolling Fourier analysis based on a 
window length that is independent of frequency, 
wavelet transformation improves the capture of time 
variability at high frequencies and improves the cap-
ture of variability with respect to frequency at low fre-quencies.2 For every observed point in time, an increasing num-
ber of neighbouring observations is incorporated in 
the wavelet analysis at lower frequencies. As a conse-quence, the frequency spectrum for which the analysis can be carried out is limited by the length of the time 
series available for the variables under observation. Data on the deposits (overnight deposits, short- term 
sight and savings deposits) of non- monetary fi  nancial 
intermediaries in the euro area are available from 1991 onwards. Data on the sector breakdown of cash in cir-
culation are only available from 1999 onwards, while 
data on that of marketable instruments has, in some 
cases, been collected for an even shorter length of 
time, which means that the study is limited to deposits of non- monetary fi  nancial intermediaries contained in M2 in order to allow it to be carried out for medium to long- term fl  uctuations as well. Index series constructed from transaction- related changes are used.
3 In simplifi  ed terms, coherence can be compared to

chart below). In this frequency band, co-
herence is even estimated to be close 
to 1; in other words almost all the fl  uctu-
ations in the growth rate of the share 
price index in this frequency area can be 
explained by fl  uctuations in the deposit 
growth rate.4
These results suggest that the relationship 
between the money holdings of non- bank 
fi  nancial intermediaries on the one hand 
and real economic developments and de-velopments in the price of goods on the other is fairly weak, but that the relation-
ship between the M2 deposits of this sector and the  fi  nancial market variables is signifi  -cantly closer.
Further analysis of the relationship between 
these two variables for periods of six to ten years shows a positive relationship between 
the growth rates for deposits and for the share price index, which has weakened 
slightly over time.5 Looking at the time dif-ference between deposit and share price developments, the frequency band under observation reveals a lag of roughly one year in the development of deposits with 
respect to share price developments, which is stable over time.
4 These coherences are statistically signifi  cantly differ-
ent from zero at the 5% level.5 The relevant measure is the cross- spectral gain. It is 
comparable to the coeffi   cient that would result from 
the regression of the growth in the share prices on the 
growth in deposits in the selected frequency band. 
Over time, its value drops for fl  uctuations with periods from six to ten years from roughly 0.95 to about 0.85.Coherence between deposits of non-bank financial intermediaries and share price index

of the fluctuations in the annual growth rate of the share index 
can be explained by the corresponding fluctuations in the de-posit growth rate. For a given length of the time series, the 
period for which coherence can be estimated is shorter the 
greater the period of the fluctuations, as a larger number of neighbouring observations is used for the estimation at every point in time.

– Loan securitisation vehicles are one example 
of shadow banks’ complementary role. 
These vehicles enhance the tradability of 
credit portfolios, thereby allowing commer -
cial banks to free up resources by selling 
loans. This in itself can give commercial 
banks greater scope for lending.30 In terms 
of monetary policy transmission, this is also 
likely to result in a restrictive monetary policy 
measure, say, constraining the supply of bank loans to a lesser degree than would have been the case without this increased interaction between shadow and commer
-
cial banks.
– Shadow banks act as a substitute for com-
mercial banks, for example, when they offer 
the non- financial sector forms of financing 
as a direct alternative to bank loans. Just as 
restrictive monetary policy measures act to 
constrain the supply of bank loans, so too is the impact of monetary policy, when viewed 
in isolation, likely to be weakened by the  alternative financing opportunities offered 
by the shadow banking system because 
monetary policy is directly targeted at com-
mercial banks and thus has an indirect im -
pact at best on shadow banks.31
This potential weakening of the impact of monetary policy stimuli, however, contrasts 
with positive effects elsewhere because shadow 
banks tend to strengthen the role played by 
asset prices. The rationale for this is as follows. 
Lending decisions particularly entail informa -
tion problems, so creditors attach considerable 
importance to the available collateral and the 
quality of the debtor’s balance sheet, that is, 
the debtor’s net wealth or capital base.32 This 
also applies where the debtor is a financial 
intermediary – the lower its net wealth and the 
poorer the quality of the collateral, the higher 
the “external finance premium”, ie the add -
itional compensation demanded by a creditor for providing the financing, is likely to be. 
Therefore, if falling asset prices shrink the net 
wealth and/or collateral value, this will tend to 
drive up the external finance premium and  restrict the financial intermediaries’ scope for 
lending. The reverse also holds true. An expan-
sionary monetary policy stance drives asset 
prices higher, causing the supply of loans to 
 increase.33
On top of this, changes in asset prices probably also have an impact on financial intermediaries’ 
risk appetite. As a case in point, increasing 
asset prices in a low-  interest-  rate setting can 
give rise to a search for superior returns, 
prompting a greater propensity to take on risk. 
In this scenario, financial intermediaries might 
be more willing to also lend to higher- risk debt-
ors at more favourable conditions. At the same 
time, an environment of rising asset prices 
might dull investors’ perception of potential risks because it could be accompanied by di
-
minishing volatility in the asset markets, further 
curbing the risk compensation demanded by 
creditors.34
The shadow banking system is likely to increase 
the significance of the asset price channel in 
the monetary policy transmission process.

on changes in the access channels to finan-
cing via the money and capital markets.
– Furthermore, given that a high proportion of 
their total assets are market-  based, asset 
price fluctuations exert a stronger influence 
over their net wealth and capital base.
– And commercial banks’ dependence on 
 financial market conditions and shadow 
banks as a source of market- based funding 
is also likely to have a procyclical impact on 
their ability to raise funds and thus on their supply of credit.
35
This is consistent with the outcome of empirical studies, particularly on the United States, which find that leverage is more actively managed by 
shadow banks than by commercial banks.36 
Asset price growth fuels shadow banks’ de -
mand for debt- financed financial assets, driving 
asset prices higher still. This creates a self-  
reinforcing process comprising balance sheet growth, rising leverage ratios, shrinking risk premiums and increased lending to the non-  
financial sector.37
All in all, these considerations do not clearly  indicate whether increased shadow banking 
activity strengthens or weakens the effective
-
ness of monetary policy. They do, however, 
suggest that a relative shift in the significance 
of certain variables in the transmission of mon-
etary policy measures is to be expected. Thus, 
increasing shadow banking activity is likely to 
enhance the role played by asset prices in the 
monetary policy transmission process.
Outlook
Owing to data gaps, it is impossible at the cur -
rent juncture to satisfactorily obtain a compre-
hensive and detailed statistical picture of the 
shadow banking system and its ties with com-mercial banks and with the non- financial sector 
in the euro area. This explains why the Eurosys-
tem’s monetary analysis has responded hith -erto to changes brought about by the shadow banking system on an ad hoc basis, and chosen 
to subject specific transactions or shadow 
banking entities to reporting requirements and 
factor them into the calculation of monetary and credit aggregates or include them in the 
constituents of the money- issuing sector once 
they had become sufficiently relevant from a 
monetary policy perspective.
More detailed analysis into the significance of 
shadow banks for monetary analysis and mon-etary policy transmission – and for financial sta-
bility, too, of course – necessitates further im -
provements to the underlying statistical data. The EU and the Eurosystem are already ad
-
dressing these requirements. The changeover 
of the national financial accounts to the Euro-
pean System of National and Regional Ac -
counts 2010 (ESA 2010) in autumn 2014 will see data being captured for the first time for 
the entire euro area on who- to- whom relation-
ships in the area of securities. Moreover, there is a raft of – mainly regulatory – initiatives de-signed to shed more light on shadow banking 
activities and facilitate better oversight. These 
include, for example, the planned creation of a 
trade repository for securities financing trans-

35 Particularly in an increasingly tense financial market set-
ting, shadow banks might be less willing to offer commer -
cial banks refinancing opportunities and pledged collateral 
for re- use. The procyclical effects in the financial system 
might be amplified as a result. See D Bleich and A Dombret

From a monetary policy perspective, the im -

German balance of payments in 2013
The German economy ran a current account surplus of €206 billion in 2013, which equates 
to 7½% of gross domestic product (GDP). This represents a moderate year- on- year rise of €7½ 
billion. A reduction in the current account surplus vis- à- vis euro- area partner countries was more 
than offset by a sharp increase in net receipts from non- European transactions, thereby continu-
ing a tendency observed since 2010. Germany now no longer exhibits a major imbalance position 
within the euro area. The adjustment processes have already had a noticeable impact, with the German economy’s contribution to that in the form of robust import growth showing up clearly 
during the reporting period, in contrast to 2012.
The increase in the current account surplus vis- à- vis non- euro- area countries in 2013 was caused 
by the fact that the economic upturn in Germany was accompanied by barely any rise in imports 
of goods from outside Europe. In addition, the German economy profited considerably from bet -
ter terms of trade on the back of a considerable fall in prices for internationally traded commod-ities and semi- finished products. Export momentum was flat in 2013. This was mainly due to the 
fact that demand for German- made high- quality capital and consumer goods in the emerging 
market economies (EMEs) was more subdued during the reporting period than in the preceding years, during which it had shot up.
Germany’s financial account with the rest of the world continued to be influenced by the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis. However, it also mirrored Germany’s current account surplus. On bal-ance, net capital exports in 2013 were high (€250½ billion). These were primarily attributable to German portfolio investment in other countries and to unsecuritised credit transactions by credit 
institutions. German banks noticeably recorded a strong decline in short-  term financial credit 
liabilities to non- residents which in part had resulted from the trend to deposit funds in Germany 
at the height of the financial crisis. This was counterbalanced, inter alia, by the sharp decline in the Bundesbank’s cross- border claims under the TARGET2 payment system. The direct investment 
sub- account – which is generally influenced by longer- term motives – likewise recorded capital 
outflows. This was chiefly prompted by German firms’ desire to further expand their presence 
abroad.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends
The German economy’s current account sur -
plus increased further in 2013, buoyed by im -
proving national and international economic 
conditions and a calmer mood in the financial 
markets. The year- on- year growth of €7½ bil -
lion was, however, much smaller than in 2012 
(+€20 billion), when the temporary intensifica-tion of the euro- area sovereign debt crisis had 
triggered widespread uncertainty in the euro 
area and led in Germany to the postponement 
of investment projects, in particular. Although global production and world trade started to 
pick up again over the course of 2013, this did 
not provide any additional stimuli for German 
goods exports. By contrast, imports were per -
ceptibly boosted by domestic demand, which from mid-2013 onwards was bolstered by  renewed business investment. Although the 
volume of imported goods went up signifi
-
cantly, expenditure on imports showed no 
year- on- year increase on balance owing to the 
marked fall in prices for internationally traded 
commodities and semi- finished products. The 
quantitative significance of the terms- of- trade 
gains (estimated at €14½ billion) is illustrated 
by the fact that they far outstripped the in -
crease in the foreign trade surplus (+€8 billion).
Besides the structurally positive trade balance, 
investment income, too, has been recording an 
increasingly sizeable surplus for ten years now. This is broadly linked to the sharp expansion in 
net external assets, although in the reporting year yield effects were particularly significant. Moreover, the revised data indicate that the 
services sub- account (including travel) has been 
close to balance since 2010.1 One reason for 
this is that the services offered by German  enterprises in the international transport and 
logistics business and as providers of IT services 
and technical and financial services are also in 
demand outside of Germany. In comparison, 
foreign competitors are not meeting with as 
much demand in Germany. This has also been the case up to now for the construction sector, 
 although utilisation of the production capaci -
ties of the German construction sector is cur -
rently extremely elevated owing to the high 
demand in Germany. The deficit recorded for 
current transfers rose comparatively sharply in 
2013, as it had done one year previously.

two countervailing tendencies. On the one 
hand, further progress has been made towards 
reducing the current account surplus vis- à- vis 
the euro- area partner countries. Thus Germa -
ny’s current account surplus vis- à- vis the euro 
area in relation to GDP has more than halved 
compared with the peak level recorded in 2007. 
Hence the adjustment processes underway in 
the euro- area countries are having a clear im -
pact on the German economy’s external trans-
actions. On the other hand, the current ac -
count imbalance vis- à- vis non- euro- area coun -
tries has steadily widened over the past three 
years. In the year under review, this owed 
something to the fact that the non- European 
goods trade balance was heavily influenced by 
the import price reversal on account of the 
greater weight of energy and commodity sup-
plies. Viewed over a longer period, however, 
Germany’s growing trade surplus vis- à- vis this 
group of countries indicates that major trading 
partners outside the euro area have not yet 
achieved a notable correction of their domestic 
imbalances.

in 2013. Nominal exports of goods fell slightly 
by ¼% after growing by 3¼% in 2012. Nom -
inal imports of goods were 1% down on the 
year. In real terms, however, they rose by an 
estimated 1½%, as import prices eased signifi-cantly. This was due inter alia to the euro’s ap-
preciation against major currencies and to 
lower world market prices for commodities and 
semi- finished products. By contrast, export 
prices declined only marginally. During the 
period under review the terms of trade thus 
shifted in favour of the German economy for 
the first time since the recession year of 2009. 
Overall, Germany’s positive trade balance in -
creased by €8 billion to €197½ billion. In purely 
arithmetical terms, this increase was solely at -tributable to price effects; in terms of volume, net exports in 2013 were down on the year.
German exports stagnated overall in 2013, and 
the very pronounced differences in regional 
trends observed in 2012 were much less in evi-
dence. While the volume of goods delivered to the euro area once again contracted, the year- 
on- year decrease of 1% was distinctly smaller 
than in 2012 (-3½%). Exports to non- European 
markets recorded an increase only for a few countries during the period under review.

ation in these countries has since changed to 
such an extent that it proved impossible to fur -
ther lift the high levels already attained. This 
was probably attributable to lower orders for capital goods owing to waning investment  dynamics and also, in part, to nearing satur
-
ation levels in the demand for high- quality 
motor vehicles. Fluctuations in demand for 
these two types of goods have a major impact 
on German foreign trade, as they account for a 
high proportion of exports, not least owing to 
German suppliers’ strong market position. Thus the share of capital goods and cars in total ex-ports was around 45% in 2013, while deliveries 
of these two product groups to G20 emerging- 
market countries made up over 57% of the 
total.
Although the level of exports to non- European 
industrial countries continued to rise, there was 
a considerable loss in momentum. Deliveries to 
the United States went up by only 1½% in 
2013 compared with 18% in 2012. There was a 
similarly marked slowdown for Japan, where 
exports stagnated during the period under re -
view after having risen by 13½% in 2012. The 
euro’s appreciation against the US dollar and especially against the yen may have played a role in this. Revenue from goods exported to the other Asian industrial countries picked up by a comparatively strong 2¼%. The impres
-
sion that the industrial countries – with the ex-
ception of the euro area, Japan and Switzer -
land – bolstered German exports during the 
period under review and thereby helped to off-
set waning demand from the emerging mar -
kets is further supported by German exporters’ business with the United Kingdom, which grew 
perceptibly (+3¼%). More goods were also  exported to central and east European EU 
countries.
Germany’s export performance vis- à- vis euro-  
area countries last year reflects the marked eas-
ing of recessionary pressure in 2013 in the 
countries worst hit by the crisis. On an annual 
average, exports to Greece, Portugal and Spain

ports to these countries even tilted upwards 
again towards the end of the year. Exports to 
Ireland expanded considerably, not least be -
cause of the pick- up in investment there. Ger -
man exporters’ revenue from business in the 
euro area did not rise overall, however, owing 
to the shrinking demand for German goods in the two large countries of France and Italy.
German capital goods showed no marked year- on- year increase in export turnover in 
2013. This was mainly due to a decline in orders of aircraft and spacecraft and of machinery and equipment, although orders of computers and electronic and optical products provided an ex-port stimulus. Automotive exports also only in-
creased marginally, although there were 
marked regional differences. While there was a clear rise in demand for German automobiles in 
the United States and the United Kingdom, 
cars sales fell in both China2 and the euro area. 
Exports of intermediate goods rose only slightly 
owing to the relatively muted pace of global 
growth. By contrast, German consumer goods 
exports recorded another jump during the period under review, which is likely to have been chiefly fuelled by the high demand for 
pharmaceutical products.
The distinct increase in real imports of goods in 
2013 was attributable to the economic upturn in Germany, which has been driven by domes-
tic demand. Germany’s expanding industrial 
output particularly benefited deliveries of inter -
mediate goods from central and east European 
countries. Close production links have been 
formed with this region over the past two dec-
ades. With regard to imports from the euro 
area, German enterprises and households pri -
marily raised their demand for capital and con-sumer goods. The marked growth in the overall volume of capital goods imported by Germany during 2013, following a dip in 2012, indicates a resurging propensity to invest over the course of the year. Higher sales were recorded, in par -
ticular, for computers, electronic and optical products and electrical equipment, but also 
machinery produced abroad. The largest single contribution to import growth came, however, from consumer goods, which is consistent with 
German households’ exceptionally high pro -
pensity to purchase.
European countries benefited to a far greater 
extent from German import demand in 2013 
than did overseas manufacturers. Thus imports 
from the euro area went up by an estimated 
3% on the year in real terms, whereas imports No rise in

from non- euro- area countries rose by only ½%. 
In 2012, deliveries of goods from both regions 
had declined in equal measure by 1¾%, while in the previous two years non- euro- area coun-
tries fared clearly better. One noteworthy fea-
ture was the downward trend in goods im -
ported from east Asia. In 2013, the value of 
deliveries from China was 6½% down on 2012. 
Imports from the newly industrialised Asian 
economies dropped last year by 3¾%, having 
already fallen in the two previous years. Im -
ports from Japan in 2013 were one- sixth lower 
than in 2011. One reason for this might be that 
during the last two years Japanese producers 
have focused on the strongly expanding do -
mestic market. Moreover, the yen’s sharp de -
preciation against the euro during the period 
under review – by around one- fifth on an an-
nual average compared with 2012 – evidently 
led to a temporary fall in the value of Japanese 
imports.3
Breakdown of invisibles
Germany’s services business with the rest of 
the world expanded in 2013 at a slower pace 
than it had done in previous years. This was because most cross- border services are linked 
to manufacturing, which developed rather 
moderately in 2013 at both a national and an 
international level. Financial and insurance ser -
vices similarly increased only slightly. By con -
trast, the exchange of business- related services 
in the technical and commercial areas, which 
are less cyclically sensitive, picked up. German 
residents’ travel expenditure abroad once again 
rose only moderately year on year. Proceeds from non- residents’ travel to Germany, which 
are far smaller, rose by a similar amount. Over -
all, Germany’s services sub- account4 recorded a 
surplus of €2½ billion, compared with €3½ bil-
lion in 2012. For cross- border travel – a major 
sub- item – the deficit was unchanged at €33½ 
billion.
German enterprises play a key role in the inter -
national freight and logistics business. Given the very intense competition and considerable 
price pressures, they are evidently managing to 
maintain market share at the expense of their 
profit margins. In 2013, cross- border transport 
– particularly sea freight5 – once again recorded 
substantial net receipts, which, at €8½ billion, 
were only slightly down on the 2012 figure. 
With moderate turnover growth during the 
period under review, revenue and expenditure 
from engineer- related and other technical ser -
vices roughly balanced out last year, as in 2012. 
By contrast, cross- border transactions con -
nected with research and development (R&D) services, IT applications and commercial ser
-
vices continued to expand sharply, thereby per -
petuating a trend that has been observed for 
some years. In these globally expanding lines of 
business, German enterprises are likewise well 
positioned overall. Whereas IT and R&D ser -
vices tend to yield a clear surplus (€5 billion during the period under review), commercial services are sourced from abroad on balance. This sub- item posted a deficit of €5 billion in 
2013. Furthermore, patents and licences ac
-
counted for sizeable receipts. Last year they 
shot up by three- tenths to €22 billion, the  lion’s 
share of which was due to rising usage fees for 
mail distribution networks. On balance, this 
sub- account recorded a surplus of €7 billion.
For five years, German construction firms have 
been shifting the focus of their activities back 
to the domestic market. Revenue earned from 
construction work abroad fell by 11% in 2013 
to €7½ billion; the cumulated fall in revenue 
from 2008 comes to more than one- quarter.6

3 This is because the value of the goods imported de -
creases simply as a result of being converted into euro if the selling prices are contractually stipulated in yen. Re
-
negotiation of the delivery contracts can lead to a drop in 
the price of Japanese goods owing to the yen’s depreci -
ation, which generally results in growth in the volume of 
demand for these products in Germany.4 Excluding freight and insurance costs for imports.
5 However, in the area of port services, expenditure far 
outweighs revenue.6 Expenditure on goods and services purchased from local 
subcontractors must be deducted from this figure. This 
went up further in 2013, lowering net revenue by just over €1 billion.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
March 2014 40

Germany continue to play only a minor role. In 
2013, they received €1½ billion for construc -
tion work, assembly and repairs. Expenditure 
was thus only slightly higher than the level 
 recorded in 2012.7
German residents’ expenditure on foreign 
travel in 2013 rose only moderately, as in 2012, 
by 2¼%. This is attributable to private foreign 
travel, which, following two years of strong 
growth, recorded hardly any increase in ex -
penditure in 2013 (+1½%). By contrast, busi -
ness foreign travel expenses climbed by 8% during the period under review, following 
sometimes sizeable budget cuts in the preced-
ing years (eg by one- eighth in 2012). Germa -
ny’s euro- area partner countries benefited dis -
proportionately from the additional expend -
iture of German business travellers and tourists. In particular, more German holidaymakers went 
to Spain and Greece again in 2013. However, 
travel expenditure in Italy and Portugal, as well 
as in Croatia, fell last year, after recording 
marked increases in previous years. Turkey and Bulgaria continued to gain in popularity as holi-
day destinations. But the number of tourists travelling to North Africa, especially to Egypt and Tunisia, plummeted in 2013 – as it had 
done in 2011 – after picking up in 2012. Ger -
man residents’ travel expenditure in Switzer -
land continued to dwindle in 2013 – having already dropped substantially during the two previous years – probably in response to the 
exchange rate adjustment. It is likely that travel destinations in Austria benefited from this. The higher level of spending in the United Kingdom may well be linked to the renewed rise in busi-ness travel budgets. Expenditure on trips to dis-
tant destinations stagnated overall in 2013 
amid a minor shift from America to Asia.
Over the past ten years, Germany has seen a 
trend of rising net surpluses from cross- border 
investment income. In 2013 the surplus came 
to €75 billion, which was up by around €1 bil-
lion on the year. This was mainly due to con -
tinuously falling outlays on outbound foreign direct investment, portfolio investment and lending. At 8%, the expenditure drop was on a similar scale to 2012. All three investment cat-
egories had an equally dampening impact on 
the liabilities side of the investment income ac-count, with interest payments on loans record-
ing the highest relative decline, dropping by 
one- sixth. Safe- haven effects may have played 
a role in this. Income from German assets abroad likewise declined distinctly (by 4½%), 
after falling by only half as much in 2012. Given the ongoing asset accumulation, the result sug-
gests that during the period under review the 
average return on Germany’s external assets was comparatively low. The return on invest
-
ment varied according to type. While revenue 
from international portfolio investment rose distinctly, receipts from direct investment dipped slightly. The biggest factor behind the poor rate of return is likely to have been the lower level of interest income from cross-  
border lending, which sank by more than one- fifth, not least because of the low- interest- rate 
environment.
Current transfers to the rest of the world went 
up sharply by 11½% in 2013 to €63½ billion, 
with both public and private- sector transfers 
recording growth. Payments to the EU posted 
the biggest year- on- year rise (climbing by one- 
sixth) and now account for more than half of 
all of Germany’s current transfers to the rest of the world. The large influx of immigrants in re-
cent years is presumably the main reason be -
hind the increase in the level of cross- border 
transfers sent by foreign workers in Germany to eastern Europe and, to a lesser extent, to southern Europe. However, these payments 
have a quantitatively small weight as they make up only 5% of total current transfers. Transfers from the rest of the world to resident recipients likewise went up by 11½%. The net deficit from 
current transfers widened by €4½ billion to 
€42 billion in 2013. Just over three- fifths of this 
is attributable to net transfers to the EU budget.Moderate rise in

Financial transactions
Underlying trends
In 2013, Germany’s current account surplus 
was again mirrored by high net capital exports 
(€250½ billion).8 Two- thirds of this figure was 
attributable to portfolio investment. A key rea-
son for the high share of portfolio investment 
in comparison to 2012 was the marked decline 
in non-  residents’ demand for German govern -
ment bonds. This reflected the easing of ten -
sions on the European capital markets, which 
in turn lessened foreign investors’ urge to turn 
to Germany as a safe haven. Instead, both do-
mestic and foreign investors refocused on the 
search for yield. Capital outflows were also 
 recorded in the other investment and direct 
 investment sub- accounts. By contrast, the Bun-
desbank’s TARGET2 claims decreased on bal -
ance for the first time since the start of the 
 financial crisis.
Positive signals for the international financial 
markets came, first, from the progress made last year towards overcoming the European debt crisis: the adjustment processes initiated 
by the countries most severely affected by the crisis have made significant headway in improv-ing their economic performance.
9 Second, sig-
nals that policymakers would begin to phase out non- standard monetary policy measures 
became increasingly apparent in non- euro- area 
countries, especially the United States. The clearest such signal was the US Federal Re
-
serve’s announcement in May 2013 that it would cut back quantitative easing, followed 
by initial tapering measures at the beginning of 
2014. Expectations that this would push up 
global interest rates likewise had an impact on 
international and German financial transactions 
during the reporting year, especially on port -
folio investment.Portfolio investment
Portfolio investment, which as a rule is particu-
larly quick to react to mood swings on the 
 financial markets, resulted in net capital exports 
of €165 billion last year amid slightly higher 
turnover, compared with €64½ billion in 2012. 
This marked rise is primarily due to a reversal of 
foreign demand for German securities. After 
acquiring large volumes of German securities in 2012, non- resident investors sold German port-
folio paper on balance in 2013. This led to a 
transaction- related decline of €24 billion in for -
eigners’ holdings of German securities.
Although the volume of domestic public bonds 
and notes purchased by foreign investors again 
exceeded the amount sold (€29½ billion), this 
represented a decrease on the year of over 
60%. This reflects international investors’ grow-
ing optimism and reduced interest in Germa -
ny’s role as a safe haven compared with previ-
ous years. This is borne out by the successful 
placement of public debt securities in Ireland, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain.
Cross- border trading in private debt securities, 
unlike public bonds and notes, resulted in net 
sales and redemptions over the year as a whole 
(€41½ billion). It should be noted, however, that the outstanding volume of bank debt 
 securities issued by residents has itself been de-
clining for years and fell by around €115 billion 
in the year under review. This is due, among 
other factors, to redemptions of covered bonds by the German Landesbanken, which no longer 
issue the same volume of these securities owing to a change in their business models. 
Moreover, credit institutions received substan -
tial deposits from non- banks in the wake of the 
financial crisis, which reduced their need to raise funding through bonds. The decline in Signs of normal-

non- residents’ holdings of German private debt 
securities is thus clearly due not only to waning 
demand, but also to a decreasing  supply.
International investors also offloaded domestic 
money market instruments on balance (€23 bil-lion). However, this was mainly paper issued by 
the public sector, which, following strong de -
mand in 2012, was sold (or redeemed) on bal-
ance in 2013. Foreign investors reduced their 
holdings of private short- dated securities only 
marginally in 2013 following significant sell- offs 
in the two previous years.
Cross- border turnover in German equities fell 
further in the reporting year. As sales fell more 
than purchases, share trading resulted in net 
capital imports of €5½ billion. By contrast, pur -
chases of German mutual fund shares by non- 
residents rose substantially, leading to further 
inflows of €6 billion.
Conversely, German investors acquired larger volumes of foreign bonds and notes on bal
-
ance (€141 billion, following €110 billion in 
2012). There was particularly high demand for interest- bearing paper. Purchases of bonds and 
notes from the rest of the euro area were 
slightly down on 2012; this was partly due to 
the fact that public authorities (including the 
resolution agencies) reduced their holdings of 
debt securities from the European periphery 
countries (through redemptions or sales). Fur -
thermore, German commercial banks’ cross-  
border activities, in line with their lending be -
haviour, remained subdued, also in respect of 
portfolio investment. By contrast, non- banks 
– notably money market funds and other non- 
monetary financial institutions – stepped up 
their foreign investment in bonds from south -
ern Europe (primarily Italy and Spain).
The net acquisition of foreign currency bonds 
also rose. In comparison to 2012, purchases of 
securities in foreign currencies more than tripled in 2013 (€22½ billion). Demand for  securities denominated in US dollars, pounds … in German

sterling and Danish krone was particularly 
strong.
Prompted by declining risk aversion and a 
brighter outlook for the global economy over 
the course of the year, domestic investors also 
showed a growing interest in foreign shares. 
They purchased equities worth €19 billion net 
in 2013 on the back of higher turnover. Persist-
ently low interest rate levels in the advanced 
economies, coupled with the expectation of 
rising long- term interest rates and accompany-
ing price losses on government bonds, may 
have contributed to the pick- up in demand. On 
top of this, stock prices rose in many countries. 
The financial markets in Europe continued to grow calmer, which likewise encouraged in
-
vestors to add equities to their portfolios. This 
is also underlined by the regional breakdown of 
share purchases. There was an above- average 
increase in purchases of equities issued by for -
eign enterprises in the euro area, but shares is-
sued by Japanese and British companies were likewise in demand. By contrast, purchases of 
mutual fund units issued by US enterprises, 
which had played an important role during 
2012, fell by almost half.
Indirect investment through foreign mutual 
fund companies had an even stronger impact 
than direct share purchases abroad. During 
2013 as a whole, German investors purchased 
foreign mutual fund units totalling over €31½ 
billion; this was more than 40% higher than 
the already high levels of demand for this type 
of investment recorded in 2012.
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments) showed net capital exports, as in the two pre-ceding years. At €16 billion, the result was on a par with 2012.
Direct investment
The international integration of the enterprise 
sector continues to make rapid progress. Ac -
cording to estimates made by the United Na -
tions Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), global foreign direct investment (FDI) rose by 11% last year to reach almost 
US$1½ trillion,10 a level comparable to the pre- 
crisis average for the years 2005-07. As in 2012, 
emerging and developing economies ac -
counted for the bulk of these direct investment 
inflows despite growing expectations in the 
course of the year that the US Fed would start 
tapering its bond buying programme. Direct 
 investment thus proved relatively robust in this 
regard. Nonetheless, UNCTAD considers that 
the gradual rundown of quantitative easing could potentially dampen direct investment flows to some of the emerging markets most strongly affected. Inflows to developed coun
-
tries also increased, although the picture was mixed. In 2013, foreign investors strongly fa

including Germany, which significantly im -
proved its position as a recipient of FDI inflows 
last year according to these data.
While foreign firms significantly increased their 
direct investment in Germany in 2013 com -
pared with 2012, German enterprises did not 
expand their foreign investment as strongly in 
the reporting year as in 2012. Foreign direct in-
vestment flows to and from Germany in 2013 
nonetheless resulted in net capital outflows of 
€23 billion (compared with the prior- year figure 
of €51½ billion).
At €43½ billion, German firms’ outbound FDI 
was down on the previous year (€62 billion). Although German companies supplied their 
foreign subsidiaries with additional equity cap-ital in 2013 (€13 billion), they mainly strength-ened their capital base by reinvesting earnings 
(€30 billion). By contrast, flows in the form of 
intra- group credit transactions practically can -
celled each other out: lending by domestic en-
terprises to their foreign affiliates roughly matched net borrowing by domestic com
-
panies from their foreign subsidiaries. In some 
cases, countervailing individual large- volume 
transactions were directly connected. For ex -
ample, funds were raised from non-  resident 
 financial subsidiaries and passed on to subsid -
iaries in other countries.
Though down on the year, outbound foreign 
direct investment remained robust, which underlines the ongoing importance that Ger
-
man firms attach to maintaining a presence 
abroad. In a survey of the Association of Ger -
man Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK),
11 46% of the companies surveyed 
– more than ever before – said that they wished 
to expand their FDI. Strategic objectives were the main reason given. Almost half the com
-
panies gave “distribution and customer ser -
vices” as their primary motive, while more than a third cited “market penetration”. Only a fifth of the companies said that “cost savings” were 
the main factor behind their foreign direct in -
vestment. Ten years ago, this was industry’s key reason for transferring production abroad. 
Since then, cost motives have become steadily less important, probably also due in large part 
to the significant improvement in Germany’s 
price competitiveness.
An expansion in German firms’ presence 
abroad does not necessarily imply lower levels 
of investment in Germany. This is shown, inter 
alia, in a study presented in the box on 
pages 46 and 47. According to this study, there

Foreign direct investment and domestic investment
In the public debate, the relatively moderate 
level of investment in Germany is often 
linked with reports of German manufactur-
ers’ expanding output abroad. It is sug-
gested, for example, that Germany’s out-
bound foreign direct investment (FDI) means that German fi  rms invest less in the domes-
tic economy as this is rendered superfl  uous 
by the acquisition or expansion of foreign 
production capacity. In actual fact, however, 
the presumed substitutional relationship 
 between corporate investment in Germany 
and German FDI cannot be empirically con-fi  rmed at the macroeconomic level.
Descriptive analysis
The data on German outbound FDI show 
no signifi  cant expansion in the recent past. 
Over the past two decades, the statistics on German FDI recorded an annual mean value 
of just under €50 billion. In 2012, Germa-ny’s FDI was just above and in 2013 just below the long- run average. These data 
provide no confi  rmation for a supposed in-
creased investment shift to export markets 
at the current time. Nor do the data indi-cate any substitution effect between for-
eign and domestic investment. A compari-
son with the investment behaviour of fi  rms 
in Germany suggests, rather, a co- 
movement between German foreign invest-ment and investment in Germany driven by 
cyclical factors (see chart). This applies equally to gross fi  xed capital formation in the total economy and to business  investment,
1 which is a more appropriate 
yardstick in this context.
Empirical analysis for Germany
A long- run complementary relationship 
 between German outbound FDI and busi-ness investment in Germany was estab-lished in a study published back in 2006.

An updated estimation for the period from 1971 to 2013 confi  rms those previous fi  nd-ings.
3 In line with the 2006 study and with 
earlier analyses,4 investment amounts were 
again normed to gross domestic product 
(GDP). Moreover, as in 2006, the measure 
chosen was direct investment in the form of 
equity stakes owing to the better compar-
ability it affords with the gross fi  xed capital formation concept.

For the analysis the equation
β1BI+ β2FDIIN+ β3FDIOUT+ c = εGDP GDP GDP
has been estimated as a vector error correc-
tion model (VECM).6 BI stands for business 
investment in Germany, FDIIN for inbound 
FDI and FDIOUT for outbound FDI (in each 
case in the form of equity stakes); c is a 
constant and ε the error term. The comple-
mentary relationship between German fi  rms’ domestic investment and outbound 
FDI is determined by the negative sign of β3 
(see table). Using causality tests,7 it can 
additionally be shown that outbound FDI 
infl  uences domestic investment. The fi  gures 
indicate that, at least in the long run, Ger-
man outbound FDI goes hand in hand with 
higher domestic investment. Increased for-
eign investment by German enterprises evi-
dently leads to a rise in domestic invest-
ment needs.
G20 states
In order to give the study a broader base, 
the G20 countries8 were analysed from 
1993 to 2012 with a view to determining to 
what extent domestic gross fi  xed capital 
formation is dependent on inbound or out-bound FDI (in relation to GDP).
9 In addition, 
the countries’ economic growth and output 
gap – as indicators of the cyclical develop-
ment and economic situation – and the level of and change in price competitive-
ness10 were included as further explanatory 
variables. Overall, the estimation (as a coun-
try panel with fi  xed effects and robust standard errors) indicates that outbound 
FDI generally has a positive, and in any case 
non- negative, impact on the development of domestic gross fi  xed capital formation. The results suggest that domestic invest-
ment is mainly driven by cyclical factors.
Conclusion
A relationship between outbound FDI and 
domestic investment can be confi  rmed em-pirically; however, it is not the frequently 
presumed negative, substitutional relation-
ship but, rather, a positive, complementary 
one. However, caution is called for when 
performing and, in particular, interpreting such studies as, on the one hand, the 
 investment definitions follow different 
methodological concepts and, on the other, 
the FDI data are unable to fully capture 
fi  rms’ foreign activity owing to the requisite 
statistical defi  nitions. These include the  reporting exemptions, but also the wide-
spread phenomenon of production by for-
eign contracting parties or licencees, which – without a corresponding equity stake – is by defi  nition not classifi  ed as FDI.

cointegration test suggests one cointegration relation-ship.7 An LR test shows that the loading coeffi   cient for out-bound FDI can be restricted to 0. That is an indication of weak exogeneity. At the same time, the coeffi   cients of the lags of

tween outbound FDI and business investment 
in Germany.
As in 2012, German FDI flowed mainly into in-
dustrial countries in 2013. In Europe, investors 
focused primarily on the United Kingdom. Out-
side of Europe, Asian countries, particularly 
China, were popular investment locations. Size-
able funds flowed in addition to North and 
South America. The foremost domestic invest -
ors during the reporting period were German 
private equity companies and manufacturing 
enterprises, especially those in the mechanical 
engineering and chemical industries.Non-  resident investors doubled their direct 
 investment in Germany from just under €10½ 
billion in 2012 to just over €20 billion in 2013. 
This increase highlights both the aforemen -
tioned global strengthening of world FDI flows 
and Germany’s attractiveness as an investment 
location; total inflows to the group of de -
veloped countries as a whole grew consider -
ably less sharply. While equity stakes in foreign- 
owned German enterprises rose only margin -
ally (€2½ billion), greater inflows came from 
the reinvestment of earnings generated in Ger -
many (3½ billion) and, most of all, in the form 
of loans from foreign proprietors to their Ger -
man affiliates (€14 billion).
The funding received by German enterprises 
came mainly from affiliated enterprises in Eur -
ope, especially from the neighbouring coun -
tries of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands 
and Switzerland. In the case of the Benelux countries, which are major locations of inter
-
national holding companies, this occurred  almost exclusively on balance in the form of 
intra- group loans. By contrast, French propri
-
etors withdrew substantial amounts of funds 
from Germany, also through the intra- company 
credit channel. While resident investment com-panies benefited considerably from fresh injec-
tions of foreign funds, the withdrawal of for -
eign capital mainly affected domestic subsidiar -
ies and branches in the manufacturing sector, 
especially in the area of vehicle construction.
Other investment
Other investment, comprising financial and 
trade credits (inasmuch as these do not consti-tute a part of direct investment) as well as bank 
deposits and other assets, resulted in net cap -
ital exports of €45½ billion in 2013. Both non- 
banks and the banking system recorded out -
flows of funds.
The cross- border transactions of domestic non- 
banks generated net capital outflows amount-
ing to €40 billion in 2013. The bulk of these Regional and

capital exports was accounted for by enter -
prises and households (29½ billion). They paid 
down cross-  border financial loans previously 
received – the majority of which were long-  
term – (€22½ billion) and also increased their 
bank deposits abroad (13½ billion). General 
government recorded additional net capital ex-
ports totalling €11 billion. These included, inter alia, the scheduled payment of two tranches to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in the amount of €8½ billion.
The banking system’s cross- border activities re-
sulted in an increase of €101½ billion in credit 
institutions’ unsecuritised net external assets in 2013. Owing to the ongoing deleveraging pro-cess, German banks’ cross- border liabilities de-
creased far more than their corresponding assets. As in 2012, the reduction in assets of 
€56½ billion mainly affected long- term finan -
cial credits. German banks’ cross- border liabil -
ities contracted by €158½ billion. A sharp drop in financial credits featured prominently in this case, too (€174½ billion), predominantly in the 
form of intra- group transactions. This should 
be partly seen as a natural rebound from the 
large influx of foreign cash to German banks in 
2012, when tensions in the euro area resulted 
in a huge volume of safe- haven flows to Ger -
many. Besides this, end- of- year window-  
dressing operations by the banking sector 
– particularly in the run-  up to the ECB’s asset 
quality review – may have played a role. The associated depletion of banks’ balance sheet assets helped to temporarily improve their 
equity ratio.
In 2013, the Bundesbank’s net external position 
recorded a decline of €96 billion caused chiefly 
by transactions under the TARGET2 payment 
system. In contrast to previous years, the TAR-GET2 balance in the reporting period dropped by €145½ billion; this was the first decrease in 
the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims since the 
start of the financial crisis in 2007.12 This was a 
reflection of the calmer mood on the inter -national financial markets and the support pro-
vided by the international community to the 
euro- area member states worst affected by the 
crisis. By contrast, a decline in non- resident 
 deposits with the Bundesbank led to capital 
outflows of €49½ billion. This mainly related to 
temporary deposits parked at the Bundesbank 
by other central banks and international organ-
isations, including funds belonging to the Euro-pean rescue packages.
Reserve assets
Transaction- related changes in the reserve 
assets are shown as a separate item in the bal-ance of payments. In 2013, they amounted to 
just under €1 billion net. The increase of €1½ 
billion in the foreign currency reserves out -
weighed a slight decrease in the reserve pos -
ition vis- à- vis the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF).
As in past years, the international reserve hold-
ings were also influenced by balance sheet ad-
justments which, in line with internationally agreed accounting standards, are not recog
-
nised in the balance of payments. The end- of- 
year revaluation of the reserve assets at market 
prices resulted in a decline of €45½ billion in 
2013. This was due mainly to downward valu-
ation adjustments on the Bundesbank’s gold 
holdings: the price of gold fell for the first time 
in years during the reporting period. In add -
ition, small write- downs due to valuation 
changes were made on the foreign currency 
 reserves and reserve position with the IMF. The 
upshot of all this was that Germany’s reserve 
assets as recorded in the balance sheet fell by 
€45 billion to €144 billion at the cut- off date of

Manufacturing enterprises in Germany and 
their vulnerability to crises – findings  of a risk analysis using annual financial statement data
The increasing duration of the financial and economic crisis has also led to the strongly growing 
awareness of a need for systematic observation and periodic analysis of the risk potential in eco-nomic systems. While studies are conducted regularly in the banking sector, say, in the form of stress tests at least of the largest institutions, there have so far been only a few cross- enterprise 
approaches to measuring and evaluating risk for the real sector, even though the existing close links between the real sector and the financial system mean that it is quite possible for them to 
interact in ways that impact on the economy as a whole.
The present article classifies the determinants of the risk of non- financial corporations and studies 
them on the basis of relevant risk metrics using a comprehensive data set from the Bundesbank’s 
Financial Statements Data Pool. The focus is on the enterprises’ vulnerability to crises, which 
manifests itself in poor profits and which can often provide important clues about shortcomings 
and structural irregularities in the corporate sector long before enforced market exits.
The empirical analysis makes it clear that enterprises which are vulnerable to crises are to be 
found mainly in industries where demand is highly sensitive to the business cycle and in sectors 
of the economy with structural problems. Particular drivers of risk in the financial sector are a 
high level of debt, which places a strain on profitability through the negative leverage effect, and, in operations, relatively rigid cost structures in the case of staff cost and other operating charges. 
Evidently, crises initially result in considerable cost stickiness if shortfalls in demand force the 
affected enterprises to cut back their output, resulting in a further deterioration in profitability and liquidity.
The findings of the study also suggest, however, that the German industrial sector possesses a 
high risk absorption potential. As a result, not only has it come through the financial crisis quite well so far; it is also tended to stabilise the financial system, rather than placing a further strain on it through adverse feedback effects. Even for most of the enterprises that were rated as vul-nerable, it has not taken long to remedy the weaknesses in profitability that had become appar-
ent. Although a very open economy, such as Germany’s, has a generally high risk exposure, a 
quite vital part in this is likely to have been played by the German economy’s sound price com-
petitiveness and cost- oriented flexibility in production as well with its high degree of regional 
sales diversification.Deutsche Bundesbank

The significance of risks 
to the economy as a whole
The financial and economic crisis and the re -
sulting strains on the financial system and the 
real economy have revealed the need for as 
systematic an analysis as possible of the risks 
and shortcomings in parts of the economy and 
the intermediary transmission and feedback 
mechanisms. While, in the banking sector, risk assessments are conducted regularly, say, in the 
form of stress tests of systemically important 
institutions, there have so far been only a few 
cross- enterprise approaches to a systematic 
measurement and analysis of the risk situation.1
The potential risks emanating from the produc-tion sector and the non- financial services sector 
are, admittedly, different in nature from those 
in the case of internationally operating major banks. The banking system is typically tightly 
interconnected within a close- meshed network 
of financial market segments and infrastruc -
tures and is shaped by the existence of big sys-
temically important players.2 By contrast, diffi -
culties experienced by non- financial corpor -
ations initially have an impact – via the link between input and output – on suppliers, 
buyers and employees as well as, specifically in 
the case of groups, on financially affiliated firms. Joint exposures of parts of the banking sector to certain sectors of the economy also 
form potential transmission channels for infect-
ing the financial system with real economic 
shocks.3 Imbalances in the real sector resulting 
from demand or cost shocks can thus have a 
direct and indirect impact on the economy as a 
whole and cause welfare losses.4 Seen in that 
light, it seems obvious to use risk identification 
approaches to conduct a systematic analysis 
not only of the financial system, but also of the real sector’s vulnerability to crises.
5
To a certain degree, fluctuations in the utilisa -
tion of capacity in a market economy are quite 
normal, however, and do not necessarily lead 
to deep or protracted recessions. Rather, innovation- driven processes in the corporate sector lead to “creative destruction”:
6 market 
exits by enterprises together with economic 
structural change constitute typical side effects of an economy that is constantly in the process 
of searching and adjusting. They are a normal 
part of a dynamic, changing economy and are an underlying inbuilt risk of the system.
Nevertheless, especially over the past few years 
as a result of the financial crisis, volatility in 
many markets and the correlations between them have perceptibly increased. This has in
-
tensified the fluctuations in profits and the re -
sulting crisis- related stresses and strains on the 
corporate sector worldwide. Even though it is 
only such a higher volatility of corporate profit and loss indicators which creates the necessary 
incentives for firms and investors to price and 
restructure the risk of their assets and liabilities 
positions accordingly, they also constitute im -
portant indicators of vulnerabilities to crises in 
the corporate sector. They are a kind of early 
warning indicator.Risk potential in

the real sector can, under certain conditions, be trans-

Theoretical and empirical 
points of approach to risk analysis in the real sector
The relationship between profit and risk is ex -
plained, above all, by financial portfolio theory. 
This states that the risk of a financial invest -
ment or an investment in a fixed asset can be 
identified by the fluctuations in the return, but 
that, owing to the existence of correlations, 
not only individual investments, but also the 
entire portfolio have to be analysed. Following 
this basic idea, the risks of non- financial cor -
porations can be assessed in the form of uncer -
tain maximum losses using special financial risk 
scores. Such an approach systematically reveals 
the corporate sector’s vulnerabilities to demand 
and cost shocks, thus pinpointing weaknesses 
that may harbour a relevant risk potential for the economy as a whole, mostly long before 
insolvency forces enterprises to exit the market.
When looking for the causal factors behind such vulnerabilities, it is generally possible to make a distinction between two levels. First, there are (non- systemic or idiosyncratic) risk 
factors which lie primarily within the sphere of responsibility of the enterprise itself and which 
apply equally to many enterprises in the same 
or a similar way. Such idiosyncratic risks in -
clude, in particular, fluctuations resulting from 
the individual enterprise’s business model. The 
business model comprises all strategic deci -
sions on the deployment of resources and on 
the in- house process of creating goods and 
services. Closely interrelated with such funda -
mental strategic decisions are organisational decisions, which, in turn, may harbour their 
own risks.
At the higher level are systemic risk factors, 
which are exogenous determinants of the over -
all risk to which more or less all enterprises are 
exposed in a given market or country and which are therefore called “market risk” and 
“country risk” respectively. From a firm’s point 
of view, this component chiefly comprises the 
fluctuations on the sales and procurement mar -kets. The latter includes not only price shocks 
and exchange rate movements as well as short-ages on the commodities and energy markets, 
but also problems in recruiting suitable skilled 
staff.
A suitable reference variable for empirical risk 
analyses using non- financial corporations’ an -
nual financial statement data is, first and fore-most, the annual profit or loss (before tax). This is expressed as a percentage of sales in order to 
eliminate any influences of the results due to 
the considerable size differences between the 
analysed firms. What argues in favour of the 
annual profit or loss before tax is the fact that it provides a profit ratio which is not distorted 
by transfers of profit or loss or by the differ -
ences in tax treatment between non-  
corporations and corporations.7

deemed to be relevant in the theory or because 
firm- specific and general risks overlap, which 
means that it is often impossible to separate 
the risks clearly. For those reasons, the empir -
ical analysis requires a reduction to a section of 
observable and separable risk factors.
The present empirical analysis is confined to 
three aspects: the cyclical risk, and thus the sys-temic problems that arise through sales market fluctuations are measured by sales volatility. As 
firm- specific factors, the focus is on financial 
and operational risks, which are captured using 
capital and cost structure ratios. Unfavourable 
effects on corporate earnings can thus be ex -
plained by the capital structure having negative leverage or by operating cost components not being sensitive or only weakly sensitive to sales.
When measuring the risk profile of enterprises 
in the manufacturing sector, the study employs 
conventional risk metrics taken from of finan -
cial portfolio theory. These figures were origin-
ally developed for investment portfolio man -
agement and for managing risks in banks’ trad-ing books and are now also used in macroeco-nomic analyses.
8 Among the various measures, 
Value-at-Risk (VaR; threshold of a distribution, 
with precisely 1% of enterprises achieving re -
sults below this figure in the following study)9 
and the Conditional Value- at- Risk (CVaR; ex -pected value of the results below the VaR) as 
well as Mean Excess Loss (MEL; expected value of the loss of enterprises which are in the red) are used as a traditional measure of risk.
10 Add-
itional aspects, such as the need for a minimum remuneration of the invested capital or the im-
puted entrepreneurial income left aside in the 
case of non- corporations, cannot be con -
sidered, however, owing to difficulties of statis-tical quantification.
The empirical study focuses initially on the question of the measurement results of the  selected risk metrics and their sensitivity with 
 regard to the financial and economic crisis. To 
do this, the three aforementioned risk meas -
ures, which represent the threshold values for 
forming the subsamples of tail and non- tail

all the manufacturing enterprises contained in 
the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Financial State -
ments Data Pool over the entire observation 
period from 2000 to 2011. Additionally, year-  
specific risk parameters are calculated on the 
basis of a reference group of enterprises during 
the observation period. In this way, it is pos -
sible to analyse movements of the risk param-
eters before, during and after crisis periods. 
This provides information, in particular, on the 
shock sensitiveness of the different measures. 
The conclusion is formed by a detailed analysis 
of crisis- prone enterprises for the period from 
2006 to 2011. This reveals the extent to which 
the different firms’ business models possess 
specific risk profiles and what factors are crucial in shaping the measured risk of the enterprises in the risky tail.
A comparison of manu-
facturing enterprises’ risk  metrics
The distribution of the return on sales, which 
was calculated on the basis of the entire data-
set for manufacturing enterprises in the obser -
vation period from 2000 to 2011 and therefore 
uses around 270,000 annual financial state -
ments from the Bundesbank’s Financial State -ments Data Pool,12 shows a clearly left- tailed or 
right- tailed underlying pattern.
In at least one of those years, a loss can be 
noted for 18½% of the annual financial state -
ments. Furthermore, it becomes obvious that 
the three selected metrics lead to major differ -
ences in the assessment of risk. The MEL (with 
the reference value z=0) covers most of the 
negative range of the distribution given a gross return on sales of -4.8%. This mean of the en-
terprises with negative performance is 11 per -
centage points above the VaR (-15.8%) and 14 percentage points higher than the neigh
-
bouring CVaR (-18.8%). This clearly shows that 
the VaR and CVaR refer more to the extreme 
cases, since they start at the first quantile, while 
the MEL is directly coupled to the loss thresh -
old and thus based on a deliberately cautious 
assessment of risk. With the MEL, 6.8% of the enterprises are classified as risky on an average 
of the whole observation period, since their 
gross returns on sales are on the other side of 
the critical threshold of -4.8%. By definition, 
this share is 1% in the case of the VaR. For the 
CVaR, only 0.5% of firms fall into this risk 
group.Left- tailed distri-

Within the manufacturing sector, these tail per -
centages differ considerably across economic 
activities. There is a clear hierarchy of risk based 
on the weak profitability of enterprises with the poorest performance. In terms of all three risk 
measures, the textiles, glass and ceramics in -
dustries, mining and quarrying as well as the 
manufacture of transport equipment are classi-
fied as relatively high- risk, while the manufac -
ture of coke and refined petroleum products, 
food, beverages and tobacco as well as the re-
pair and installation of machinery and equip -
ment appear to be more low- risk.
The three risk metrics also show quite marked 
differences in terms of their tails with regard to 
the legal form categories of corporations and 
non- corporations. Non- corporations are not 
represented as strongly in the tail as corpor -
ations. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind 
that the imputed entrepreneurial income is in -
cluded in the profit in the case of partnerships 
and sole proprietorships and that their return situation is overstated according to the avail
-
able data.
In differentiating the risk measures by firm size, 
it becomes evident that it is very small enter -
prises that are much more highly vulnerable to 
risk. Using all three risk measures, they show 
higher tail percentages and are thus more 
strongly represented in the critical distribution 
section than the other small firms, as well as 
medium- sized firms and large firms. Obviously, 
the still unfavourable capitalisation of such micro- enterprises, which also include the cat
-
egory of young firms, means that they are ex-
posed to a considerable funding risk. By con -
trast, the sustained improvement in the capital structures of SMEs over the past few years has led to their risk profiles becoming notably more like those of large enterprises.

Comparing risk metrics 
over time
In order to study the determinants of fluctu -
ations in profitability over time without distor -
tive changes to the sample, the following ob -
serves a balanced sample of enterprises over 
the period 2006 to 2011; the sample is com -
prised of around 9,500 manufacturing firms 
per year for which annual financial statements 
are available for the whole of the observation 
period. Because of the additional restriction 
placed on the data pool in this study in order to 
ensure availability and comparability of results 
throughout the period, a sample selection bias 
may arise, distorting the findings of the study. 
The potential selection bias derives from the 
fact that annual financial statements are gener -
ally not available or there are no data on insolv-ent or newly established enterprises. However, 
the problem is unlikely to be of any great sig -
nificance in this case, since the corporate sec -
tor did not display unusually elevated levels of 
insolvency or market entry of new enterprises 
during the observation period. Comparing the 
results from the balanced sample with calcula-tions based on the full sample also shows that, 
although the proportion of enterprises in the 
tail is higher for the full data set, this propor -
tion displays a very similar pattern of change 
over time. That indicates that valid generalisa -tions may be derived from the conclusions 
drawn from the results for the balanced sam -
ple.
In this data set, the percentage of firms in the 
tail according to all three measures varied rela-tively little in the period 2006 to 2008. Then, in 2009 the huge collapse in profits resulting from 
the financial crisis rapidly caused the percent -
age of enterprises with critical performance to more than treble. However, this sharp build- up 
in potential risk in the manufacturing sector was not of long duration. The percentage halved as early as 2010, and then dropped 
more or less back to its starting level in 2011. 
This state of affairs is also visible from the 
changes in the tail ratios, which can be inter -
preted as the balance of probability of transi -
tion into or out of the negative portion of the 
distribution. Under all three risk measures, more firms exited the tail than entered it on balance during the healthy economic condi
-
tions of 2007. However, this trend reversed 
 itself in 2008 – when the financial crisis was 
already making itself felt – followed by a multi-
plication of net tail entries in the crisis year of 
2009, until the position was finally made good 
in the subsequent two years by corresponding 
countervailing movements. The study results 
also reveal that healthy enterprises which found 
themselves in the tail because of the crisis did Study on the

not spend much longer than a year in this 
problematic loss zone on average. Despite the 
unfavourable economic environment and the 
increasing difficulty of generating returns, these 
firms were able to consolidate their earnings 
position within a short space of time, and in -
deed needed somewhat less time to achieve 
this than enterprises with weak returns in periods of normal economic growth.
14 None -
theless, according to the insolvency statistics 
from the Federal Statistical Office, 40.5% more manufacturing enterprises declared themselves 
insolvent in 2009 than in the previous year. 
However, the number of insolvencies was back 
at its pre- crisis level as soon as 2011. It is evi -
dent from this that German enterprises have a 
particularly marked ability to absorb risk, at 
least for certain types of shock, and were there-
fore able to handle the huge macroeconomic 
shock which emanated from the financial and 
economic crisis without lasting damage to their earning power – in the context of a good over -
all economic position before the crisis, a well-  
diversified global sales market as well as a fa -
vourable competitive position and robust finan-cing conditions.Determinants of enterprises’ 
vulnerability to crises and their variability over time
Though it is useful to quantify enterprises’ vul-
nerability to crises using suitable risk param -
eters, a systematic analysis of risk in the real 
economy must go further than that. From an economic policy perspective, pinpointing the 
determinants of the observed profitability situ-ation is just as important. With this in mind, the 
median values of central balance sheet and 
profit and loss account metrics were calculated 
in the three risk categories set out above for 
firms classed as tail and non- tail enterprises on 
the basis of their MEL figures. For market risk, 
the sales variation coefficient, which reflects the cyclical vulnerability of company- specific 
business, is used as the central indicator. As one might expect, the empirical results show 
that weak profitability is connected inter alia to 
fluctuations in demand, though the differences in sales volatility between tail and non- tail firms 
are not particularly marked.15 It is clear, how -
ever, that the business models of enterprises which offer their customers more specialised products – which in terms of manufacturing 
processes are associated with greater produc -
tion depth – are more vulnerable to risk than is the case for providers of standardised products. Production structures in which the value added 
chain requires a high proportion of in-  house 
manufacture also offer little scope for distribut-
ing risk in a targeted way (eg risk associated 
with inventories) to suppliers by means of out-sourcing. Both the ratio of tangible fixed assets to total assets and that of staff expenses to ma-
terial input – which, for lack of more precise 
indicators, are used to approximate production High level of

14 The amount of time which ailing firms, on the other 
hand, initially spend in the tail before they become insolv-
ent cannot be ascertained from the available data pool, as the balanced sample only includes enterprises which were 
operational throughout the observation period 2006 
to 2011.15 The variation coefficient tends to be moderated by the 
fact that relatively large drops in demand only occur in the 
small number of crisis years, whilst in times of economic 
normality, which are more prevalent, sales figures tend to 
move in relative harmony.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
March 2014 58

depth and the degree of specialisation respect-
ively – show much higher median values at tail 
enterprises. For instance, the median use of fixed assets by risky enterprises is more than five percentage points above the median for enterprises outside the tail, and the ratio of 
staff expenses to material input at the former 
– resulting from a growing share of enterprises 
with very high staff expenses during the crisis 
in particular – is more than 15 percentage 
points above the ratio for the non- tail group.
Furthermore, in times of economic weakness, 
negative financial leverage in the capital struc-ture has a not inconsiderable effect on earning power and thus on enterprises’ risk profile. The financing mix at tail enterprises leads to about 
one- third more loan capital than at firms out -
side the tail. Their equity ratio is only 17.3% on 
average, whilst at the other firms in the bal -
anced sample equity accounts for 28.1% of 
total assets. The differences in the use of alter -
native sources of external funding are equally clear. Tail enterprises obtain finance in the form 
of bank loans to a significantly greater degree 
than the other firms under observation here. Over the years, the ratio of bank liabilities, at 
around 16.7%, has been just less than five per -
centage points higher than at other enterprises 
in the sample. In the crisis year of 2009, this 
gap widened to ten percentage points.
There are similarly marked divergences in group- based financing methods. At 11.4% 
compared to 6.7%, tail firms have greater re
-
course to intragroup lending, although its share 
of total financing declined significantly in the crisis year. Clearly, part of the reason why periods of downturn have a clear impact on the balance sheet structures of group com
-
panies is that the scope for intragroup finan -
cing narrows markedly. With risky firms being 
more dependent on external financing, their 
interest expenditure, at 1.6% of sales, is twice 
as high, and thus has a significantly greater im-Negative lever-

Signifi  cance tests for risk factors in the manufacturing 
 sector
Statistical t- tests can be used to examine the signifi  cance of differences in the ex-
planatory factors between tail and non- tail 
enterprises classifi  ed on the basis of the 
mean excess loss of gross return on sales.1 
Particular attention is paid in this context to 
the development before, during and after the major recession of 2009. Corporate 
data for 2006, 2009 and 2011 are used to 
ensure the independence of the observa-tions and thus the ability to make a prob-
abilistic statement.
As an indicator of market risk or as a proxy 
for the fl  uctuations in the fi  rm’s capacity 
utilisation, the sales volatility of the respect-
ive fi  rm in the form of the coeffi   cient of 
variation in the observation period is used. 
Financial risk is calculated as the ratio of 
debt to the balance sheet total. Operational 
risk is operationalised as the sum of staff 
costs, write- downs and other operating 
charges as a percentage of turnover.
The median values provide information about the situation of these explanatory 
variables in different periods of the business 
cycle and have the advantage over the 
arithmetic mean of being invariant to out-
liers. In order to assess the statistical signifi  -cance of the empirical differences, standard 
errors for the medians were calculated using a non- parametric bootstrap. A clas-sical t- test can thus be applied for the  median difference of the tail and non- tail 
enterprises.
In the case of market risk, it is possible to note slight differences in terms of sales volatility between tail and non- tail enter-
prises. With the crisis, the median values in 
both subsamples increase relatively clearly, 
although the growth in the case of the tail 
enterprises is more than four times higher 
than that of the non- tail enterprises and the 
identifi  ed differences are statistically highly 
signifi  cant in the crisis year. Furthermore, it emerges that in 2011 market risk in the 
case of the non- tail enterprises persists at a noticeably higher level than before the crisis 
and that there are now no longer any  appreciable deviations between the two 
categories of enterprises.
For fi  nancial risk measured using the debt ratio, in all three years there emerge clear 
differences between the tail enterprises and 
non- tail enterprises which, even for the  median values, attain orders of magnitude considerably higher than 10 percentage 
points and are highly signifi  cant throughout. 
In the crisis, there was a marked decline in 
the leverage ratio of both groups, although the fall in the case of the tail  enterprises, at 
5 percentage points, was clearly stronger 
than in the case of the non- tail enterprises 
(3 percentage points), thus reducing the gap 
from -14.2 to -12.7 percentage points. It is 
debatable whether the overproportional de-cline in the debt ratio at the crisis- prone en-
terprises was primarily due to a more cau-tious fi  nancing policy, as can be observed 
fairly consistently in the case of the non- tail 
enterprises. In a process of “voluntary” de-
leveraging, the latter had continued to ex-
pand their capital base, even in times of cri-sis, thus making themselves less dependent 
on external sources of funding. The poor earnings situation of the tail enterprises, 
which left hardly any scope for profi  t reten-
tion, tends to suggest that the crisis led to 
these enterprises making a considerable cut-back in their business activities, reducing the need for funding in some cases, or that they 
were even subject to effective fi  nancing 
constraints. With the upswing, these prob-
lems are evidently no longer relevant and the tail enterprises are sharply expanding 
their levels of leverage again, so that the dif-
ference from the reference group increases 
to as much as -16.8 percentage points.
The differences are similarly marked in the case of operational risk. First, the median 
values between the two groups are 11.8 per-centage points apart, although, with a prob-
ability of error of less than 1%, the differ-

pact on their profitability than is the case with 
the other enterprises selected for the study.
The most significant risk driver in the real econ-
omy proves to be negative operational lever -
age, which results mainly from a high propor -
tion of fixed cost and delays in adjusting vari -
able cost. A key determinant of differences in 
performance and risk is the substantial discrep-
ancy in staff expenses. Tail enterprises have a 
staff expenses ratio of over 31.5%, which is 
more than seven percentage points higher than 
that of other enterprises in the balanced sam -
ple. Furthermore, the disproportionate level of staff expenses at risky enterprises suddenly rose by almost nine percentage points for a time in 
the financial crisis in 2009, widening the gap between these enterprises and the others in the group to close to 11 percentage points. This finding suggests that even the variety of human resources measures aimed at making the deployment of staff more flexible in line with utilisation, for instance through working time accounts, were not adequate or not ap -
plied to a sufficient extent to adjust staff ex -
penses in the crisis. The observed rigidity and expansion of this cost factor may also arise 
from the fact that it was precisely those enter -
prises which experienced sharp falls in demand 
in the manufacturing sector which reacted to 
the crisis by hoarding labour rather than shed-ding it, in order not to be hampered by labour 
shortages when the economy recovered and 
they wanted to step up production.
Similar differences can be seen in other operat-
ing expenses, though these differences re -
mained very stable in the course of the crisis. 
This collective item includes, for example, ex -
penses for temporary workers, rents and leas -
ing instalments, cost for consumables and the 
like. At 19.0%, the ratio of this cost factor at 
tail enterprises is an average of 4.3 percentage 
points above the median values for non- tail 
firms in the balanced sample. As might be ex-
pected, depreciation expenses at risky enter -Staff expenses

levels of other operating  expenses and depreciation also increase riskences are also highly signifi  cant here. Never-theless, in the case of operational risk, too, it is apparent that the  selected operating costs rise much more sharply (7 percentage points) in the case of the tail enterprises than at the 
non- tail  enterprises, where this cost factor 
grows by only around 2 percentage points. 
The tail enterprises are obviously affected by considerable cost stickiness, as the crisis- related adjustment of the business volume does not lead to matching savings on the 
operating cost side. Along with the cyclical 
upturn, the tail enterprises’ cost pressure  returns to normal again and the difference 
from the reference group in fact goes down to slightly below its pre- crisis level.Median differences

prises, at 3.8%, are more than 1½ percentage 
points higher than at non-  tail firms in the bal -
anced sample. This higher level of fixed capital 
consumption is due to differences in the de -
gree of capital intensity and greater production 
depth, and is reflected in the differences be -
tween the two groups of enterprises in the 
amount of fixed assets on their balance sheets.
Summary and conclusions
The present study, based on available annual 
financial statements from non-  financial corpor -
ations in the manufacturing sector in the Bun -
desbank’s Financial Statements Data Pool, 
makes clear that various risk metrics may be 
used to capture vulnerability to crises in indus -
try and the causes thereof. The results show 
that the vulnerability to crises of manufacturing 
enterprises, measured in terms of weakness in 
profitability, displays significant differences ac -
cording to sector, legal form and company size. 
The key determinants emerge clearly from the 
empirical data. In terms of market structure, 
enterprises in a stable demand environment, 
and thus, in particular, consumption-  r elated 
sectors which are not heavily dependent on the 
business cycle, are less prone to risk. A low 
level of production depth in manufacturing 
processes and a broadly based product range 
also reduce risk. On the financing side, a sound 
capital base and low use of loan capital provide effective protection against the negative lever -
age effect in times of crisis which leads to rigid 
or heightened loan capital costs. These place 
an additional damper on profitability besides the disproportionate rise in unit production costs which is often experienced. Particularly 
risk- r elevant factors on the cost side include 
staff expenses, other operating expenses and depreciation connected with the structure of 
manufacturing processes. It is clear from this, 
once again, that a broad capital base and flex -
ible cost structures, particularly in relation to 
staff expenses, are key prerequisites for the ef-
fective mitigation of enterprises’ vulnerability to 
risk in the non-  financial sector.
The study also shows, on the basis of a bal -
anced sample of enterprises, that German in -
dustry displayed a great capacity for shock ab -
sorption in the last crisis and proved able to 
handle a heightened level of risk in a relatively short space of time. This also enabled potential 
contagion in the financial sector to be avoided. 
While specific levels of resistance to shock are 
dependent on the type of shock in question, in general it is the case that competitive products, 
a strong market presence and sound financing 
structures, along with a functioning banking 
system and a high degree of cost-  oriented pr o-
duction flexibility, are the key factors in ensur -
ing the stability and sustainability of entrepre -
neurial and overall economic success.Flexible labour

Methodological annex
Risk measurement methods for corporate 
financial statement analysis
When measuring risk in the corporate sector, the 
main objectives are to capture unfavourable earn -
ings and liquidity constellations and to identify 
events and conditions which lead to losses or re -
duced income. Financial portfolio theory has de -
veloped a number of metrics for this, which can be 
divided into quantile and shortfall measures.16 The 
essential difference between the two categories is that in the first category the risk measure is defined 
indirectly on the basis of a specific measure of distri -
bution location, the quantile. This determines the 
results threshold which, with given probability α, is 
not exceeded or undershot, depending on which side of the distribution one is located on. Shortfall 
measures, on the other hand, make direct use of a 
16 See, for example, P Albrecht and R Maurer, Investment- 
und Risikomanagement, third edition, Stuttgart, 2008,

fixed reference or threshold results value and show 
with what probability undesired deviations from a 
given target value or unfavourable results variables 
(the shortfall), such as losses or liquidity deficits, will 
occur.
The most important quantile measures and those 
most commonly used in risk analysis are Value-at-
Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). VaR 
is the given value of result X which will not be ex -
ceeded within a set time horizon with given prob -
ability α. The implicit definition is therefore as fol -
lows.17
P [X ≤ VaRα (X)] = α
Thus, VaR is the α- quantile for the distribution of X.
However, VaR has a number of methodological 
weaknesses. For example, it may breach the key 
axiomatic condition for risk analysis of subadditivity 
(the aggregate risk must not be larger than the sum 
of the individual risks), giving rise to the problem of 
a lack of coherence in risk measurement.18 In terms 
of content, it has the disadvantage that it only de -
fines a loss boundary (loss which occurs at least with 
given α), which may mean that even greater losses 
at the margin of the distribution on the other side of 
the VaR value are left out of consideration.
CVaR, which does not have this undesirable prop -
erty, quantifies the average loss (the average of the 
VaR values) which arises in the selected (negative) 
section of the distribution and which is calculated as 
the centre point of the corresponding margin.
CVaRα(X): = E[X | X < VaRα(X)] = 
VaRα (X) + E[X – VaRα (X) | X < VaRα(X)]
When deriving the shortfall measures, the first step 
is to stipulate a critical threshold directly, not a prob -
ability. One key shortfall measure is Mean Excess 
Loss (MEL). This determines the expected excess loss which occurs when the reference loss z is undershot.MELz(X) = E(X – z | X < z)
Because of its construction, MEL is closely connected 
to the unconditional Expected Shortfall (ES).
MELz(X) = ESz (X) / P (X < z)
If the results variable X has a discrete distribution, 
this is as follows.
MELz(X) = ∑
i (xi – z) . P(X = xi ^ X > z)
P(X < z)
MEL is thus the mean (additional) loss under the 
condition that the negative scenario (in relation to 
the threshold) has occurred.Key asymmetrical risk measures
