6OverviewWeaker growth but upturn intact
Global economic growth suffered a notice-
able loss of momentum in the fourth quarter
of 2007. This was due mainly to the distinctly
slower rate of expansion in the industrial
countries, whereas the emerging market
economies and the commodity-exporting
countries continued to grow at a rapid pace.
The weakening of the cyclical momentum in
the industrial countries was attributable partly
to the effects on the real economy of the con-
tinued turmoil in the financial markets, which
was triggered by the subprime crisis in the
USA in the third quarter of last year. This was
compounded in the fourth quarter by the
steep increase in oil prices and the rise in
food prices.
The financial markets continued to grapple
with the ongoing problems emanating from
the US real estate market. Supported by inter-
est rate cuts in the United States, stock mar-
kets around the world proved relatively robust
until the year-end. However, a sharp slump in
share prices has been recorded since January
2008 amid mounting fears of a US recession.
Significantly greater risk aversion on the part
of investors resulted in a “flight to safety”
and declining yields on government bonds.
At under 4%, the yield on ten-year Federal
bonds (Bunds) in the fourth quarter was more
than1/C252percentage point down on the third
quarter. At the same time, the spreads on
risky bonds widened significantly, so that fi-
nancing conditions for corporate issuers in
the bond market became slightly less favour-
able in spite of the fall in the “base rates”.International

7In the fourth quarter of 2007, the euro main-
tained a strong position overall. At the begin-ning of January 2008, it reached a new his-torical high against the US dollar of US$1.49.Disappointing figures for the US economyand problems experienced by US banks andother financial institutions as a result of theturbulence on the US credit markets weighedon the US currency. By contrast, the sharpinterest rate cuts made by the US Federal Re-serve in January have had little impact on theeuro-dollar exchange rate. Instead, it wasintermittent increasing concerns that weakgrowth and financial market problems in theUSA will spill over to the euro-area economythat caused the euro-dollar exchange rate toslip below its record high from the start ofJanuary.
Following a phase of stabilisation and consoli-
dation in the euro money market, whichlasted until November 2007, new reports ofhigh losses of US banks triggered a freshwave of uncertainty on the financial markets.However, generous refinancing operationsand a flexible use of liquidity policy instru-ments largely eased the tense liquidity situ-ation on the German money market.
Given the difficult situation and the uncer-
tainty about the effects of the US real estatecrisis, the ECB Governing Council maintainedits steady monetary policy course over thepast few months. The minimum bid rate inthe main refinancing operations (MROs) hasconsequently been kept at 4% since the lastinterest rate increase in June 2007. However,the Governing Council continues to harbourconcerns regarding longer-term inflationrisks, which had previously led it to gradually
reduce the expansionary thrust of monetarypolicy. The ongoing dynamic monetary andcredit expansion is not the only indication ofsuch risks. Risks to stability are also latent inthe generally robust macroeconomic setting,tightening labour markets and, above all,strong price pressure. Measured by the Har-monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP),year-on-year euro-area consumer prices roseto 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007. InJanuary, prices increased further, with the re-sult that the HICP was 3.2% up on the yearat the end of the reporting period.
As expected, the German economy recorded
fairly muted growth in the final quarter of2007. According to initial figures from theFederal Statistical Office, aggregate outputincreased by 0.3% in the fourth quarter afteradjustment for seasonal and calendar effects,compared with 0.7% in the third quarter.
While there is no detailed information on the
demand structure in the reporting quarter atpresent, the available indicators suggest thatprivate consumption and construction invest-ment failed to match their level of the thirdquarter – ie the same demand componentswhich have so far realised little of theirgrowth potential.
Subdued final domestic demand is likely to be
one reason why imports likewise declined inthe fourth quarter. Possible causes are thatenterprises pursued a more cautious courseof inventory management in the reportingquarter and that exports were no longer in-creasing as sharply as before. However, in

8statistical terms, foreign trade probably none-
theless generated a clearly positive contribu-
tion to overall economic growth.
In spite of the slowdown in economic
growth, the rise in employment strengthened
again somewhat in the final quarter of 2007.
Industry, in particular, further increased its
number of employees. In addition, there was
an expansion of headcount in the “renting
and business services” sector, in which the
hiring-out of labour is also recorded. At the
same time, unemployment continued to fall
at an accelerated rate in the fourth quarter.
One reason for this might be that, up to the
day of the official count in December, there
had not yet been any weather-induced re-
strictions in the outdoor occupations. Further-
more, the granting of seasonal short-time
working benefits, which were introduced in
2006, may have dampened the seasonal fluc-
tuations somewhat. The number of persons
out of work, at 3.57 million, was 623,000
lower than in the same period of 2006. The
quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted un-
employment rate went down from 8.9% to
8.5% and showed a further fall to 8.1% in
January 2008. Although this was noticeably
lower than one year before, unemployment
remains at an unacceptably high level. A mod-
erate wage policy therefore remains impera-
tive so as to underpin further labour market
improvements. Furthermore, it is crucial that
the rewards of the labour market reforms
undertaken in the past years, which are now
becoming evident, are not jeopardised by
backward-looking modifications. In particular,
extending minimum wages to additional sec-
tors would endanger the chances of furtherprogress being made in the problematic seg-
ments of the labour market.
Alongside labour market reforms and eco-
nomic growth, moderate wage developments
have made a major contribution to reducing
unemployment over the past few years. On
an annual average in 2007, the rise in labour
costs in the economy as a whole was again
fairly moderate – despite some large claims
submitted at the beginning of the 2007 pay
round and some relatively large settlements
in industry. The same can be said of growth in
negotiated pay rates in the fourth quarter
(+1.1% year on year). This muted increase
was due in part to a baseline effect after one-
off payments raised the reference figure for
the final quarter of 2006. Cuts in end-of-year
bonus payments in the public sector and at
public sector banks were an additional factor.
If one-off payments and additional benefits
are excluded, the year-on-year rate of wage
increases in the fourth quarter of 2007 was
1.7%.
Negotiated wage rates will rise distinctly
more sharply in the first half of 2008 since
many of the increases in standard pay agreed
in 2007 will come into effect. Furthermore,
pay agreements will be expiring in a number
of major sectors – above all, for employees of
central and local government, as well as in
the iron and steel industry, the chemicals in-
dustry, textiles and textile products manufac-
turers and hotels and restaurants. Negoti-
ations in the metal-working industry are
scheduled for the second half of the year. As
far as is known at present, the scale of some
of the claims will exceed the level seen initial-Labour marketWages

9ly in the last round of negotiations, with the
loss of purchasing power in 2007 being citedas one of the reasons for this. It should benoted, however, that the price increases of2007, owing to their strong fiscal and exter-nal components, have scarcely increased the(nominal) scope for income distribution.
Price developments in Germany continued to
be strongly influenced by external influencesin the fourth quarter of 2007. As well as en-ergy prices, the global rise in prices of foodstoked consumer price inflation. Somewhatsharper price increases were also recorded inthe field of industrial goods. The price trendfor services and housing rents was still com-paratively moderate, however. Overall, theyear-on-year rate of consumer price increasejumped from 2.1% in the third quarter to2.8% in the fourth quarter. This was thehighest rate of inflation since early 1994.Based on the old 2000 basket of goods, theFederal Statistical Office has estimated a year-on-year increase in consumer prices of 2.7%in January 2008. The annual rate as measuredby the HICP was 3.0%. The final January fig-ures will be published at the end of Februaryand will then refer to a new basket of goodsfrom 2005. In addition, various methodo-logical changes, especially concerning theseasonal pattern of price developments, willbecome effective.
Despite the slowdown in growth towards the
end of 2007, which came as no great sur-prise, the future outlook for the economy inGermany has not deteriorated noticeablycompared to the forecasts of last December.Nevertheless, the risk factors that have beenmaking the economic outlook appear subject
to a greater measure of uncertainty thanusual since the middle of last year continue toexist. They have, in fact, become more signifi-cant in some respects, such as the scenario ofa marked cyclical slowdown in the UnitedStates. So far, however, the probable impacton the German economy remains very limit-ed. On the whole, the German banking sys-tem has coped well with the turbulence ofthe past few months and has maintained itsstability and functional viability. Overall thereis still the prospect that domestic demand –which was dulled by general uncertainty andthe strong upward pressure on prices in thefourth quarter, which is probably only tem-porary – will be lifted by the upside potentialjustified in terms of the fundamentals.
This applies most of all to private consump-
tion, which has been curbed not only by thesharp increases in prices since the final quar-ter of 2007 but also by the suddenly gloomierexpectations in respect of prices and incomes.Household sentiment has meanwhile re-covered slightly and the propensity to pur-chase large consumer items has increasedagain. Precautionary saving, which was initial-ly their prevailing motive, is therefore likely tohave become somewhat less important. Pri-vate consumption might thus benefit more infuture from the ongoing strong revival in thelabour market and the more favourable in-come prospects.
One component that will be missing at the
start of the year is the portion of investmentin machinery and equipment that was shiftedforward to last year owing to the expiry of

10the declining-balance depreciation facility for
movable assets. Looking at the high level of
capacity utilisation in many sectors of indus-
try, however, there are a large number of
enterprises which still need to procure new
machinery and equipment. And, indeed, in-
dustrial enterprises have recorded a big rise
in new orders of late. The seasonally ad-
justed volume of orders in the fourth quarter
was 5% up on the preceding three-month
period.
The sharp (61/C252%) increase in new export
orders indicates that German industry has
been able to extend its market position even
under difficult underlying conditions. This is
due, above all, to the strong position of cap-
ital goods producers thanks, not least, to
their attractive range of goods on offer. Des-
pite the somewhat more subdued global
growth and unfavourable price competitive-
ness in the dollar area, export-oriented indus-
try is looking optimistically to the future.
The public finance situation again improved
significantly last year. After the general gov-
ernment deficit fell to 1.6% of gross domes-
tic product (GDP) in 2006, a balanced govern-
ment budget was achieved in 2007 for the
first time since German reunification accord-
ing to provisional data from the Federal Stat-
istical Office.
Germany’s budget is also balanced in struc-
tural terms (ie after adjustment for cyclical
and temporary effects), meaning that the
medium-term fiscal objective set by the Fed-
eral Government was therefore already
reached in 2007. Following the dropping ofthe excessive deficit procedure in June 2007,
an additional important provision of the EU
fiscal framework has thus been met. If this
course of sound public finances is main-
tained, then the debt ratio could also quickly
be brought below the reference value of
60% defined in the EC Treaty.
The renewed incurrence of a deficit in 2008
envisaged by the Federal Government in the
latest update to the stability programme is
not fully compatible with the European fiscal
framework, particularly as the programme is
based on rather favourable macroeconomic
assumptions. The deficit is mainly attributable
to lightening the load on tax and contribution
payers from lowering the contribution rate
to the statutory unemployment insurance
scheme and reforming business taxation.
A further loosening of fiscal policy, as has re-
cently been adopted in the United States, for
example, to avert the threat of recession, cur-
rently does not seem appropriate in Germany.
Although the macroeconomic risks have risen
slightly in Germany, overall the domestic
economy remains in robust shape and within
the corridor of normal capacity utilisation.
Therefore, there is no justification for jeopard-
ising the consolidation that has been pains-
takingly achieved over the past few years.
Furthermore, it may generally be doubted –
not least given past experience – that at-
tempts to actively steer the German economy
by fiscal means will be crowned with success.
As a rule, it appears to be more appropriate,
given a structurally sound financial situation,
to let the automatic stabilisers take effect – as
is also envisaged in the European fiscal frame-Public finances

ation at the present time, embarking upon anexpansionary fiscal policy could prove to be
an unnecessary and costly venture.

12Global and European
settingWorld economic activity
Having expanded strongly in Q2 and Q3, the
world economy suffered a noticeable loss of
momentum at the end of 2007. This was due
mainly to the distinct slowdown in growth in
the industrial countries. This was particularly
true of the US economy, where the housing
construction sector is under even greater
pressure to adapt and perceptibly weaker
stimuli emanated from the other components
of private final demand. Economic activity
sagged somewhat in the euro area as well. In
Japan, by contrast, overall output picked up
sharply despite dampening effects emanating
from residential construction owing to lively
growth in exports and corporate investment.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) in the in-
dustrial countries taken together is estimated
to have grown in the fourth quarter by just
under1/C252%, after adjustment for seasonal and
calendar variations, on the third quarter, in
which it had grown by as much as nearly 1%.
It rose by around 21/C252% on the year. Output
likewise grew by an average of 21/C252% in 2007
compared with 23/C254% a year earlier.
In contrast to developments in the industrial
countries, the economies of those countries
exporting oil and other commodities con-
tinued to grow at a rapid pace in the fourth
quarter of 2007. Some countries are now
even showing increasing signs of an over-
heating economy; inflation in the Middle
East’s OPEC members has risen distinctly, and
in Russia, it reached its highest level since
2005, coming in at 11.9% in December. Ac-

13likewise appeared to show strong growth in
the final quarter of the year. However, thereare signs that exports from this region to in-dustrial countries, particularly the UnitedStates, have risen at a slower pace. Real GDPin China grew somewhat more moderatelythan in the third quarter, at 11
1/C254% on the
year. This is probably due in part to variousbraking measures initiated by the govern-ment. However, price pressure remained fairlyhigh; in December, consumer price inflationstood at 6.5%.
The slowing of economic activity in the indus-
trial countries is attributable partly to the realeffects of the continued turmoil in the finan-cial markets. This has had a particular impacton the United States, where both the housingmarket and the financial sector have comeunder increasing pressure, pulling privateconsumption into their wake via negativewealth effects and a tightening of creditstandards. In other industrial countries, thisturbulence has likewise left its mark onbanks’ profit and loss accounts and balancesheets, yet the impact on the non-bank sectorhas remained very constrained. As far as it ispossible to tell, the effect on the emergingmarket economies has been minimal. How-ever, additional key negatives that affectedthe world economy in the fourth quarterwere the strong increase in oil prices and thecontinued rise in food prices. This led to a de-terioration in the price climate and sharply di-minished consumers’ purchasing power, es-pecially in countries with lower average in-comes. With regard to the global economy,experience has shown that such terms oftrade effects tend to act more quickly thanthe expansionary stimuli caused by higher
revenues in the commodity-producing coun-tries.
In the light of the macroeconomic trends and
the problems that the United States is under-going, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)revised its global forecast for 2008 by a visiblemargin at the end of January. Global growthis now forecast to weaken from nearly 5% in2007 to just over 4% in 2008. After recalcu-lation using a methodologically comparablebasis,
1the forecast for growth was revised
downward by3/C254percentage point from 2007
to 2008 compared with just under1/C252percent-
age point in the autumn 2007 forecast. TheUS forecast was downgraded from nearly 2%to 1
1/C252%. The revisions for developing coun-
tries and emerging market economies, at -1/C254
percentage point to just under 7%, were fair-ly moderate by comparison. In the case ofChina, the growth rate of 10% for 2008 pro-jected in October has even remained un-changed.
Despite the dampening of global growth and
the more modest outlook, oil prices onceagain rose sharply in the fourth quarter of2007, by nearly one-fifth from their summer
1The IMF recently recalculated global GDP based on up-
dated purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. The weights
of fast-growing emerging market economies, especially
China and India, have declined noticeably, which means
that global growth rates are now much lower. Growth of
4.4% and 5.0% has now been reported for 2005 and
2006, respectively, compared with pre-revision figures of
4.8% and 5.4%, respectively. The autumn 2007 forecast
of +5.2% now corresponds to an increase of +4.7%.
However, during the latest adjustment to the forecast,
this figure was revised upwards to +4.9%. The end-
January update of the forecast for the world economy,
the main economic regions and major industrial countries
is based on the recalculated actual figures.Financial

14levels denominated in US dollars (Brent crude
oil). At the beginning of January, a new high
was marked at US$981/C254. Owing to the euro’s
appreciation, the rise in the euro-
denominated price of oil from the third to the
fourth quarters, at 121/C252%, was much smaller;
oil prices peaked in January at 3661/C252. How-
ever, the past few weeks have seen an easing
of sorts in the market owing to the more
downbeat news about the economy and thetemporary subsiding of the geopolitical tur-
moil. Falling futures market prices are signal-
ling only a slight easing in the near future. In
the light of new political risks, spot prices
have nevertheless latterly gone back up to
US$95 or 365. The US dollar-denominated
prices of other raw materials likewise rose
markedly – by 81/C254% – between October and
early February. Continued upward pressure
on the prices of food, beverages and tobacco,
which increased by 291/C254% during this period,
were the main reason. By contrast, the prices
of industrial raw materials tended to move
sideways. Non-energy commodities were up
143/C254% on the year in US dollar terms and
21/C254% in euro terms.
The prices being quoted on the markets for
crude oil and food once again sharply drove
up consumer prices in the industrial countries
in the past few months. Year-on-year infla-
tion rose from 2.0% in September to 3.2% in
December; excluding Japan, the year-on-year
rate rose from 2.4% to 3.6%. This owed not
only to the recent rise in oil prices but also to
a base effect, since consumer prices, after
seasonal adjustment, had fallen slightly at the
end of 2006. Core inflation (excluding energy
and food) rose in autumn from 1.9% to 2.1%
at year’s end. Headline inflation, averaging
2.2% in 2007, was 0.2 percentage point
lower than in the two preceding years. At
1.9%, however, core inflation reached its
highest level since 2001; excluding Japan, it
came to 2.3%.
According to an initial estimate, real US GDP
growth slowed down in the final quarter of
2007 to +1/C254% after adjustment for seasonalLog scale

15and calendar effects. For 2007 as a whole,
GDP was up by 21/C254%. One of the main rea-
sons for the sluggish fourth-quarter growthwas the accelerated decline in residential in-vestment, by 6
1/C252% on the period. Another
was that the depletion of inventories resultedin a
1/C254percentage point loss in growth. More-
over, the remaining demand componentsshowed weaker growth. Private consumptionwas up by only
1/C252%, and corporate invest-
ment, at 13/C254%, did not grow as strongly as in
the two preceding quarters. The growth rateof real exports, to close the list, dropped dis-tinctly to 1% after adjustment for seasonaland calendar effects. Since imports remainedvirtually unchanged, foreign trade as a whole,however, still made a slight contribution toGDP growth.
The acceleration in the rise of consumer
prices was one of the key factors putting thebrakes on private consumption in the fourthquarter. The rate of inflation, at 4.0%, was1.6 percentage points higher than in the thirdquarter. Energy prices, which shot up by17.8% on the year, accounted for the lion’sshare. Some relief is in sight for the wintermonths given the slight easing of oil prices,yet this is being offset by an import price-driving depreciation effect. Excluding energyand food, inflation stood at 2.3% in thefourth quarter, which also corresponds to theannual average of core inflation. The personalconsumption expenditure (PCE) deflator, ex-cluding these volatile components, rose by2.1%.
The latest economic indicators suggest that
2008 has got off to a weak start. The busi-ness sentiment in industry continued its slide.
New orders of durables fell in the fourthquarter by 1
1/C254% after seasonal adjustment.
Consumer confidence has now fallen to itslowest level since October 2005. Excludingsales at petrol stations, seasonally andcalendar-adjusted retail sales were hardly anyhigher in January than in December in termsof value. The labour market figures for Janu-ary were likewise poor, with the number ofnon-farm employed persons falling – if onlyslightly – for the first time since the summerof 2003. At 4.9%, the unemployment ratewas
1/C252percentage point above its last low in
March 2007.
There are still no signs that residential con-
struction and the real estate market will bot-tom out. Sales of new and older owner-occupied homes in the USA continued to fallin the fourth quarter. However, because thenumber of houses up for sale is now smaller,the supply has only risen marginally. The me-dian prices for new and older owner-occupied housing were 10
1/C252% and 6% down
on the year respectively. The number of con-struction permits fell visibly once again in thefourth quarter. Nominal residential invest-ment in the United States – as a percentageof GDP – fell from 6
1/C254% at the peak of the
construction boom at the end of 2005 to4
1/C254% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and was
thus slightly below its long-term average of4
1/C252%. If the housing glut and earlier cyclical
troughs are any measure, further consider-able downward adjustments are in the offing(see chart on page 16). With regard to con-struction activity, the sharp decline in residen-tial construction in the past few years has, on

16the whole, been cushioned by the significant
increase in investments in non-residential
properties. It remains to be seen to what ex-
tent the contractionary forces emanating
from the housing market will be mitigated by
the US Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate
cuts.
Total output in Japan, following a rather
weak result in the third quarter of 2007, once
again rose significantly more sharply in the
fourth quarter according to initial calcula-
tions, by a seasonally and calendar-adjusted
1% on the quarter. Lively export activity and
favourable investment demand from enter-
prises were the main factors behind this good
result, with real exports up by an unchanged
strong rate of 3% on the quarter, while im-
ports grew by only1/C252%. Just under half ofGDP growth can therefore be attributed to
foreign trade. Corporate investment was like-
wise up by 3%. By contrast, private con-
sumption, at +1/C254%, continued to move along
the flat growth path onto which it had em-
barked in the second quarter. The continued
sluggishness of wage and salary growth may
have had a dampening effect in this respect.
In connection with a permit backlog caused
by new construction regulations for earth-
quake protection, the decline in residential in-
vestment accelerated once again (–9%). It
was down 211/C252% on the year. Driven by the
sharp increase in oil prices, which was exacer-
bated by the depreciation of the yen against
the US dollar, consumer prices rose in the
fourth quarter by a seasonally adjusted 0.4%,
more clearly than in a long time. The year-on-
year rate of price increase went up to 0.5%,Percentage of nominal GDP, quarterly, after seasonal and calendar adjustment

17compared with –0.2% in the third quarter.
Excluding energy and food, however, the
slight decline in the price of consumer goods
in Japan continued (–0.2%).
In the final quarter of the year, the UK econ-
omy grew by an estimated1/C252%, after adjust-
ment for seasonal and calendar effects, on
the previous period, in which it had grown by
3/C254%. This rather minor letup conceals the
sharp slowdown in the banking and insur-
ance sector in connection with cooling real
estate markets and the turmoil in the finan-
cial markets. Real value added in the markets
for business-related and financial services was
up by only just under1/C252%, with growth rates
of mostly 1% to 11/C252% having been the norm
both in the preceding quarters and in preced-
ing years. This was offset, however, by accel-
erated growth in value added in other ser-
vices sectors as well as in the production sec-
tor. Various special factors were at work here,
such as in mining, which includes oil produc-
tion, and in agriculture, where a sharp decline
in the summer owing to animal diseases was
followed by a positive turnaround. On the de-
mand side, for which detailed national ac-
counts data are not yet available, the stimuli
from private consumption are likely to have
subsided considerably; at all events, real retail
sales were up by only1/C252%, after seasonal ad-
justment, on the third quarter, in which they
had grown by as much as 11/C252%. This is con-
sistent with the fact that seasonally adjusted
real estate prices in the fourth quarter fell by
3/C254% from their third-quarter levels. By con-
trast, the annual rate of change in the nation-
al Consumer Price Index rose by 0.5 percent-age point to 2.2% in the September-January
period.
In the 11 new EU member states (excluding
Slovenia, which acceded to the euro area on
1 January 2007), economic activity also
seems to have slowed down in the fourth
quarter; at all events, industrial output
growth, at a seasonally adjusted3/C254% on the
period, was significantly slower than its aver-
age over the first three quarters of 2007
(+13/C254%). However, it was still 6% up on its
level of the fourth quarter of 2006. As
growth was once again strong in 2007 and
migration to the west European EU member
states persisted, unemployment continued to
decline. In eight of the eleven countries, the
December unemployment rate was already
under the euro-area average of 7.2%. The
positive overall picture of economic activity,
however, is dimmed by the increase in price
pressures, with inflation continuing to rise
from 4.4% in September to 5.8% in Decem-
ber, once again widening the distance to the
euro-area HICP inflation rate. Sharp increases
in the price of energy and food, which have a
considerably larger weight in the basket of
household goods in the new member states
than in the euro area, were the main reason
for this. In addition, the price increases, par-
ticularly in the case of food, were in many
cases a great deal stronger than in the old EU
member states.

third quarter, in which it had grown at a rate
of3/C254%. Real GDP growth averaged 23/C254%i n
2007. The more moderate pace of growth in
the euro area, in terms of the contribution of
individual countries, was primarily due to the
slowdown in growth in Germany and France.
By contrast, the Spanish economy was able
to maintain its rapid clip. No information was
yet available for Italy as this report went to
press. According to the available leading indi-
cators, only rather tepid growth in the euro
area may be expected for the current quarter.
In a sectoral view, it was particularly industry
which produced weaker stimuli in the final
quarter of 2007; seasonally adjusted indus-
trial output barely increased, compared with
11/C252% in the third quarter. This was caused by
a decline in the production of consumer
goods and virtual stagnation in the manufac-
turing of capital goods, while energy produc-
tion rose significantly. The renewed slight de-
crease in capacity utilisation in the manufac-
turing industry over the October-January
period is consistent with the sideways move-
ment of industrial production. Mixed signals
have been emanating from industrial produc-
tion since the turn of 2007-08. Orders re-
ceived in October-November were up by
31/C254% in terms of value from their third-
quarter levels. Excluding the manufacture of
other transport equipment, where large
orders have a major effect, the increase re-
mained at 1%. In January, the Purchasing
Managers’ Index for industry held steady at
the previous month’s level. This was offset,
however, by a further deterioration in indus-
try confidence, even though the balance of2000 = 100, seasonally adjusted, log scale

19positive and negative responses is still well
above the long-term average.
On the demand side (as far as can be gleaned
from the patchy information available todate), the slowdown in economic activity inthe fourth quarter is reflected in a decline inreal retail turnover by a seasonally adjusted1% on the quarter and
3/C254% on the year. This
was offset in some measure by purchases ofnew motor vehicles which, in the fourth quar-ter, surpassed their third-quarter level by2
3/C254%. This was abetted by a very sharp rise in
vehicle registrations in France in connectionwith the introduction of a government sub-sidy for the purchase of low-carbon vehicleswith effect from early December 2007 andthe entry into force on 1 January 2008 of aspecial tax on the purchase of high-CO
2ve-
hicles. Not only did consumer demand sub-side, but construction investment – and prob-ably residential construction in particular –was also subdued. By contrast, corporate de-mand for machinery and equipment seems tohave remained lively, and exports to non-euro-area countries remained on their growthpath, surpassing their third-quarter level bya seasonally adjusted 1% in October-November. At the same time, imports re-mained unchanged; foreign trade is thus like-ly to have contributed positively to overalleconomic growth.
The situation in the euro-area labour market
has continued to improve. The unemploy-ment rate fell from 7.3% in the third quarterto 7.2% in the final quarter of 2007. The fig-ure one year earlier had been as high as7.9%. Around two-thirds of the total declinein unemployment – by 192,000 on the quar-
ter – was accounted for by Germany andone-third by France. In Spain, by contrast, un-employment rose perceptibly. In most of theother countries, it changed only little. Thenumber of persons in work rose in the thirdquarter – the last period for which informa-tion is available – by a seasonally adjusted0.3% on the quarter and 1.9% on the year.The rise in hourly labour costs, at a seasonallyadjusted 0.6% during this period, was a bitmore subdued, with the year-on-year rise re-maining unchanged at 2.5%.
Euro-area price pressures, however, picked up
sharply in the fourth quarter. The seasonallyadjusted consumer price inflation rate was1.0%, following 0.6% in the third quarter.Energy prices increased more sharply again,April to December 2007, percentage change

20and food also became distinctly more expen-
sive. Owing to rising commodity prices
throughout the world, consumers had to
spend more on milk and dairy products, in
particular. Trends varied widely among the in-
dividual countries, with the prices of milk
products (including fats and oils) already
starting to increase in Germany in the second
quarter and continuing to rise significantly in
the summer months, whereas price pressures
for these products became evident in France
and Italy only in the fourth quarter. The trend
showed that prices tend to increase more
strongly in those countries that, according to
Eurostat, had had lower-than-average price
levels in 2006.2On the whole, the price of
dairy products has risen by between 14%
and 20% in Germany, Slovenia and Austria
but by less than 5% in Finland, France and
Italy. The figures for cereal products ranged
from 1.0% in Finland to 4.9% in Germany to
15.5% in Slovenia. For industrial goods (ex-
cluding energy and food) and services, by
contrast, price trends hardly changed. The
overall year-on-year rate of increase in theHICP grew from 1.9% to 2.9%. A base effect
resulting from the fall in energy prices at the
end of 2006 also played a role.
At 2.1%, average consumer price inflation for
2007, despite relief-providing revaluation ef-
fects and weaker rises in energy prices
(+2.6% compared with +7.7%), was similar
in scale to a year earlier, in which it had stood
at 2.2%. However, various fiscal measures
adversely affected prices. The increase in the
standard rate of VAT in Germany on 1 January
2007 was in itself enough to contribute
around 0.4 percentage point to average an-
nual euro-area inflation. The sharp rise in
food prices in the second half of the year was
another contributory factor. According to re-
sults for individual euro-area countries, prices
continued to go up in January 2008. Year-on-
year HICP inflation rose to 3.2% from 3.1%
in December 2007.

21Monetary policy and
banking businessInterest rate policy and the money
market
Over the past few months, the Governing
Council of the European Central Bank has
continued its steady monetary policy course.
Since the last interest rate increase on 13 June
2007, the main refinancing operations have
been conducted as variable rate tenders with
a minimum bid rate of 4%; the interest rates
on the marginal lending facility and the
deposit facility have been 5% and 3%, re-
spectively. However, the concerns regarding
longer-term inflation risks, which had previ-
ously led the Governing Council to reduce
the expansionary stance of monetary policy in
the Eurosystem, continue to exist as before in
the council’s opinion. The ongoing dynamic
money and credit growth has not been the
only indicator for this. Stability risks have also
been associated with the strong price pres-
sures (stemming mainly from energy and food
prices), the overall robust economy and the in-
creasing tensions on the labour markets.
Following a phase of stabilisation and consoli-
dation of the money market conditions which
lasted until November, the announcement
that US banks had sustained large losses as a
result of their direct or indirect involvement in
the loan securitisation business triggered a
new wave of uncertainty on the financial
markets, which also disrupted the gradual
further easing of tension on the European
money market. However, with the help of
generous refinancing operations and a flex-
ible use of liquidity policy instruments, it was
possible to defuse the tense liquidity condi-
tions on the money market for the most part.Eurosystem

22Money market management and liquidity needs
During the three reserve maintenance periods from
10 October 2007 to 15 January 2008, euro-area
credit institutions’ need for central bank money
arising from autonomous factors determining bank
liquidity fell by 56.7 billion in net terms. The volume
of banknotes in circulation in the euro area in-
creased sharply by 530.9 billion, the expansion
being particularly robust in December, which is
usual for the time of year, but still somewhat sharp-
er than a year before. Banknotes reached a high of
5680.0 billion on 1 January 2008. However, this
sharp increase was more than offset by the remain-
ing autonomous factors. Liquidity needs arising
from general government deposits fell by 517.3 bil-
lion net. If, in order to eliminate valuation effects,
the changes in net reserve assets and other factors
are taken together, these two items resulted in a li-
quidity provision of 520.3 billion. This was caused
mainly by Eurosystem purchases of financial assets
which are unrelated to monetary policy. The re-
quired level of minimum reserves went up notice-
ably by 57.3 billion, giving rise to greater demand
for central bank liquidity.
In the period under review, the Eurosystem contin-
ued its generous supply of liquidity to banks, which
began in August 2007, to help keep the money mar-
ket functioning as normal and limit the volatility of
the EONIA. The Eurosystem made it possible for
banks to, again, fulfil their reserve requirements
early within the maintenance period. The extension
of the two supplementary longer-term tenders
gave three-month refinancing operations a higher
weighting than weekly refinancing operations. In
the period under review, the Eurosystem carried
out a total of 14 fine-tuning operations. Liquidity-
providing fine-tuning operations were no longer
necessary.
In the first main refinancing operation (MRO) of
the maintenance period beginning on 10 October,
the ECB allotted 540.0 billion above the benchmark,
thus reinforcing its policy of “allocating more li-
quidity than the benchmark amount in main refi-
nancing operations”. The liquidity management
aim of “keeping very short-term rates close to the
minimum bid rate” was also underlined. When the
EONIA tumbled to 3.82% at the beginning of the
reserve period, the ECB stabilised the overnight
interest rate with a five-day liquidity-absorbing
fine-tuning operation with a volume of 530 billion.
For the rest of the period, the EONIA stood at just
over 4.00%, indicating a slight tendency towards an
easing of tensions over the more marked fluctua-tions in money market rates at the beginning of
the crisis in August. In line with its communication,
the ECB reduced above-benchmark amounts over
the reserve maintenance period to 53.5 billion in
the last MRO. The EONIA decreased to 3.84% on
the penultimate day of the period. In response, the
ECB carried out a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning
operation with a volume of 537 billion on the last
day of the maintenance period which led to under-
bidding of 59.3 billion and caused the EONIA to fall
to 3.76%.
In the November-December maintenance period,
the ECB continued its considerably increased allot-
ments in MROs. However, rising marginal allotment
rates and a continuous increase in the EONIA to a
high of 4.11% caused the ECB, on 23 and 26 Novem-
ber, to reinforce its liquidity policy vis-/C224-vis market
participants without implementing the usual prac-
tice of gradually reducing amounts allotted above
the benchmark within the maintenance period. This
curbed the upward trend, although the EONIA con-
sequently fell to a low of 3.74% and the ECB coun-
tered with liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning opera-
tions. The EONIA stood at 4.04% on the last day of
the maintenance period.
In the December-January maintenance period, the
liquidity needs of banks, which, although usual for
the time of year, were particularly pronounced
owing to the continued tensions in the money mar-
ket, were the focus of liquidity provision at Christ-
mas and the turn of the year. The Eurosystem there-
fore resolved on 30 November to extend the main
refinancing operation scheduled for 19 December
to 16 days. The de facto fixed-rate tender – owing
to the announcement that all bids of 4.21% and
above would be met – proved to be a suitable meas-
ure for reducing uncertainty in the money market.
Even so, the very high above-benchmark allotment
of5168 billion quickly brought the overnight rate
back down to well under 4.00%, with the result
that the ECB reacted on a daily basis with liquidity-
absorbing fine-tuning operations until the maturity
date of the main refinancing operation. The EONIA
stood at 3.92% on the last day of the year. In the
new year, the usual fluctuations in the EONIA were
felt towards the end of the maintenance period.
After a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation
with a volume of 520.0 billion, the EONIA stood at
4.08% and was therefore 8 basis points above the
minimum bid rate. The integration of Malta and
Cyprus into the euro area passed smoothly from a
liquidity management perspective.

23As in previous months, the Eurosystem, with-
in the framework of its operations on the
money market, ensured an earlier provision
of liquidity (front loading) in the course of the
reserve maintenance period. This was aug-
mented by offers of additional longer-term
refinancing operations. In this way, the Euro-
system made it easier for banks to carry out
operations that continue past the turn of the
year, something which is generally associated
with considerable difficulties. Against this
background, the Eurosystem extended the
maturity of the main refinancing operation
conducted on 19 December from seven to
16 days and completely allocated this oper-
ation, starting, as previously announced, at
an interest rate of 4.21%.1At the same time,
the Eurosystem also made increasing use of
liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operations in
order to take excess liquidity out of the mar-
ket again and so keep the overnight market
interest rate (EONIA) from falling too far
below the minimum bid rate.
In this way, the Eurosystem was successful in
avoiding liquidity shortages and serious func-
tional disruptions on the money market.
However, these measures tended, at best,
to simply counteract the – at times – high
degree of nervousness of the market players.
This can be seen especially in the develop-
ment of the longer-term money market rates,
whose risk premiums for unsecured money
market transactions had clearly increased as a
result of the subprime crisis. For example, the
interest rate spread between the uncollat-
eralised three-month Euribor and the collat-
eralised three-month Eurepo had increased
to more than 0.9 percentage point by mid-December. After the turn of the year, this
interest rate premium had been clearly re-
duced again. It was last measured at 0.4 per-
centage point but was still well above the
rate prior to the outbreak of the turmoil on
the financial markets (when it was less than
0.1 percentage point).

24were mostly interested in M3 components re-
munerated close to market rates, whereas
the combined M1 components, currency in
circulation and overnight deposits, increased
by only just under 1% in the reporting period
in seasonally adjusted and annualised terms,
compared with just over 4% in the previous
quarter. Marketable instruments, by contrast,
were more in demand in the period under re-
view. For example, especially money market
fund shares were built up again significantly,
after being reduced at an annualised rate of
111/C252% in the third quarter. The refusal by
some funds to take back their own shares in
order to avoid fire sales of their own holdings
of paper and thus losses in the unfavourable
market environment evidently caused invest-
ors for a time to sell money market fund
shares. Moreover, the reporting period again
saw demand for short-term bank debt secur-
ities, which benefited from the market inter-
est rate rise at the short end of the maturity
spectrum, and for short-term time deposits,
which sharply increased again in the fourth
quarter. They were sought, in particular, by
other financial intermediaries as well as
households. This also involved shifts at the
expense of overnight deposits.
As in previous quarters, the heavy lending of
banks to the private sector was the main
source of money creation in the euro area.
However, the growth of loans to domestic
private non-banks significantly slowed down
in the fourth quarter. In seasonally adjusted
and annualised terms, they increased by al-
most 9% most recently, compared with a cor-
responding rate of 121/C252% in the period from

ations did not expand their loan portfolios inthe final quarter as much as in the fourthquarters of previous years. In addition, bor-rowing by households also decreased. Thequantitatively important housing loans, inparticular, were recently much less in demandthan in the same period of the previous year.This continued a trend that had already beenobservable for around one and a half years.Not only the steadily rising housing interestrates in this period but also the cooling of theproperty boom in some countries of the mon-etary union are likely to have had a dampen-ing impact in this case. Consumer loans alsoclearly lost momentum in this time. By con-trast, unsecuritised lending to non-financialcorporations shows no declining trends sofar. Most recently, these loans from domes-tic banks expanded at a 12-month rate of
14.4%. At the same time, the banks partici-pating in the Bank Lending Survey for theeuro area reported a further tightening of thecredit standards for enterprises, which alsoapplies particularly to loans that are raised forthe purpose of corporate mergers and acqui-sitions. Together with the increased bankinterest rates, this is likely to dampen theexpansion of corporate loans.

acquisition of a large European bank by an
international bank syndicate. In seasonally

area government securities. However, this
was partly accompanied by repayments of
government loans.
The monetary capital formation at banks in
the euro area accelerated again in the fourth
quarter, following a comparatively moderate
increase in the third quarter. Recently, how-
ever, the sharp rise in banks’ equity and
reserves, which are counted as monetary cap-
ital, made a major contribution to this accel-
eration. In addition to an extensive equity
injection for the partial financing of the ac-
quisition of a large bank in the euro area as
well as the partially quite high profits of credit
institutions, many European banks probably
augmented their reserves in order to be bet-
ter protected against possible consequences
of the credit market turmoil. Moreover, do-
mestic non-banks also topped up their long-
term time deposits significantly. On balance,
however, these were simply a reflection of
the activities of other financial intermediaries
and were mainly associated with securitisa-

27side the European banking sector to acquire
long-term bank debt securities evidently was
low. In addition to Germany and Spain, this
also concerns Ireland, where the volume of
such paper outstanding in the final quarter of
the year showed an unusually strong decline.
Euro-area banks recorded another generally
strong outflow of funds in the foreign pay-
ments of non-banks domiciled in the euro
area. This caused the net external asset pos-
ition of banks vis-/C224-vis non-residents to de-
cline again in the fourth quarter. In contrast
to the development in 2006 and at the start
of 2007, monetary developments were rather
dampened by this in recent months in sea-
sonally adjusted terms.
In spite of the slight weakening in the fourth
quarter, the strong monetary and credit
growth still gives cause for stability policy
concerns. The inflation forecasts carried out
using monetary data, in any case, indicate
that the inflation risks rose further in the
fourth quarter. In this context, however, the
financial market turmoil is likely to have en-
couraged non-banks to hold money. More-
over, the downturn in loans to households
constitutes an appropriate development from
a monetary policy perspective, as this reduces
the need for monetary policy action. How-
ever, the likewise desired dampening of the
loan dynamics among non-financial corpor-
ations is not yet observable. The declining
trends in the other euro-area countries were
more than offset by accelerated lending to
enterprises in Germany.Deposit and lending business of German
banks with domestic customers
As in the rest of the euro area, the strong
growth of bank deposits in Germany con-
tinued in the fourth quarter. In this context, it
was mainly short-term deposits of domestic
non-banks that increased again. In the report-
ing period, they increased very strongly, at
12%, in seasonally adjusted and annualised
terms. On balance, however, domestic invest-
ors exclusively set up short-term time deposits
(with an agreed maturity of up to two years),
which are traditionally remunerated close to
market rates and thus also benefited in the
fourth quarter from the continued rise of
money market rates. On average, banks in-
creased their rates in this area of their deposit

28most1/C254percentage point. Short-term time
deposits were especially in demand by house-
holds. As in the previous quarter, this caused
shifts at the expense of short-term savings
deposits, which had already been on a steady
decline since the end of 2005, as well as a
clear reluctance to acquiring long-term secur-
ities. Furthermore, however, other financial
intermediaries also noticeably topped up their
short-term time deposits.
Longer-term time and savings deposits were
also augmented further by domestic investors
in the final quarter of the past year, although
their most recent rise was weaker than in pre-
vious quarters. Households, for example, set
up longer-term time and savings deposits to a
much lesser degree than in the third quarter.
Moreover, the other financial intermediariesmade greater reductions in their deposits
with a maturity of over two years than they
usually do in the fourth quarter. However, this
was accompanied by a marked increase of
longer-term time deposits by general govern-
ment.
German banks’ provision of funds to domes-
tic customers increased comparatively strong-
ly in the reporting period. It is true that banks
once again noticeably reduced their holdings
of securities from public and private issuers in
Germany and that the loans of institutions to
domestic general government declined in the
fourth quarter at a seasonally adjusted and
annualised rate of 101/C252%. However, this was
accompanied by a strong seasonally adjusted
and annualised growth of almost 61/C252%i n
unsecuritised loans to the domestic private
non-bank sector. On balance, however, only
enterprises (both financial and non-financial
corporations) raised additional funds. The
sharp seasonally adjusted rise in loans to fi-
nancial intermediaries outside of the banking
sector is likely to have been due mainly to the
fact that the usual seasonal decline of reverse
repurchase loans by domestic banks was sig-
nificantly lower than in the previous two
years. In general, the reverse repurchase
agreements reflect domestic banks’ security-
backed provision of funds to other market
players (mostly other domestic banks, but
also foreign institutions as well as the German
Finance Agency). This provision of funds is
conducted via an electronic trading platform
provided by a domestic custodian in its func-
tion as the central counterparty. Such trans-
actions are traditionally reduced significantly
towards the end of a year. However, liquiditySeasonally adjusted

on the parti cipatin g banks’ len ding poli cy. This 
was aime d at o btainin g more detaile d informa-

chan ging their risk per ception, by ren derin g 
reﬁ nan cing more difﬁ cult an d/or because it 
results in capital restri ctions (for instan ce as

According to the German institutions surveye d,

In fa ct, banks’ chan ged risk per ception ha d the

31provisioning in this way is likely to have
played a greater role than usual owing to theprevailing fear on the market at that timethat there might be even greater tensions inthe money market at the turn of 2007-2008as a result of the financial market turmoil.
Furthermore, non-financial corporations also
borrowed heavily from domestic banks in thereporting quarter. This essentially confirmed atrend which had already started in earlierquarters and which reflects the strong invest-ment activity of enterprises. There was a par-ticularly strong rise in the demand of enter-prises for short-term bank loans towards theend of the year. In this case, more difficultterms of issue on the commercial paper mar-ket may have played just as much a role as ex-piring depreciation allowances and the ex-pectation of future borrowing options atlower rates. By contrast, households recentlycurtailed their borrowing from Germanbanks. Housing loans, for example, were sig-nificantly reduced. In view of the currentweakness in housing construction and the as-sociated downturn in new borrowing, loanrepayments are now likely to have a greatereffect on the housing loans reported in thebanks’ balance sheets than in previous years.Moreover, non-housing loans to householdsalso declined further.
According to the results of the Bank Lending
Survey, banks had somewhat stricter creditstandards in their lending business, especiallyfor corporate customers, in the fourth quarterof 2007, whereas, in previous years, relax-ations of lending conditions could mostly beobserved. For example, the credit standards
for enterprises increased slightly overall for allmaturities and size categories. According tothe institutions, this was due mainly to theirincreased refinancing costs on the money andcapital markets and their somewhat deterior-ated liquidity position. Against this back-ground, the banks surveyed also increasedtheir margins for the first time in three yearsnot only for riskier corporate loans but alsofor average corporate loans. Margins alsowidened discernibly for consumer loans,while the margins for housing loans weregenerally still under pressure. According tothese figures, German banks as a wholetightened their credit supply policy less thanwas reported for the rest of the euro area inthe fourth quarter.
In accordance with the market trend, lending
rates in the final quarter differed dependingon the interest rate fixation period: whileshort-term loans became more expensive forthe most part, the conditions for longer-termprovisions of funds eased. Thus, at the end ofthe period under review, the reporting institu-tions were demanding between 5.5% and6.5% for short-term corporate loans and be-tween 5.4% and 5.5% for long-term corpor-ate loans, depending on the size of the loan.In the area of private housing loans, the con-ditions for loans with an interest rate fixationperiod of over ten years were 5.0% at theend of the period under review, comparedwith 5.1% in September. In the deposit busi-ness, by contrast, German banks reported aslight increase of remunerations. In this case,the focus was on short-term time deposits.

32Financial marketsFinancial market trends
The international financial markets were, in
the fourth quarter of 2007, dominated by the
ongoing credit market disruption and grow-
ing concern about the global economy. Al-
though global stock markets were supported
by US rate cuts and proved relatively robust
until year-end, global equities suffered heavy
losses in January 2008 given fresh concerns
about the impact of the credit market turmoil
on financial institutions and mounting fear of
a US recession. Significantly greater risk aver-
sion on the part of investors resulted in a
“flight to security“ and put considerable pres-
sure on government bond yields; in addition,
spreads on risky bonds widened significantly.
At the end of the reporting period, two more
US rate cuts totalling 125 basis points and
relatively positive economic signals for the
euro area helped calm things down. Against
this backdrop, the euro appreciated further,
reaching a new historic high at the beginning
of January 2008, but subsequently slipped
back again slightly.
Exchange rates
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the euro put in
a strong performance overall. This was par-
ticularly true against the US dollar. Following
the change in direction in US monetary policy
in mid-September, the euro’s upward trend
was, for the most part, unbroken, as a num-
ber of negative US economic data releases
led market players to expect further Fed rate
cuts. In addition, US banks’ problems as a re-
sult of the crisis on the US credit markets det-Financial

33rimentally affected the US dollar in this
period. The euro slipped slightly, but onlytemporarily – in response to unexpectedlystrong US consumer price inflation. However,the risks to the US economy rapidly movedcentre stage again in response to fallingprices on the US real estate market as well asdisappointing labour market data; conse-quently, the euro-dollar exchange ratestrengthened to US$1.47 at year-end. It wasthus almost 12% up on the year and roughly25% higher than at the start of monetaryunion.
At the beginning of the new year, sentiment
towards the euro on the foreign exchangemarkets initially remained positive, and thesingle currency reached a new historic high ofUS$1.49. In mid-January, however, concernsthat the real estate crisis in the United Stateswas spilling over to the euro-area economyappear to have hurt the euro. The euro-dollarexchange rate slipped slightly as a result, and,when this report went to press, the euro wastrading at US$1.46 and thus below its all-time high again.
The euro displayed no clear trend against the
yen in the fourth quarter of last year. Al-though changing assessments of what eco-nomic impact the credit market crisis wouldhave on Japan resulted in temporary losses,the European currency was quick to recover.The fact that the euro-yen exchange rate fre-quently correlates with US and Europeanequity indices could be an indication thatinternational investors have financed stockmarket investments in the United States andEurope using yen liabilities. In this envi-ronment, the euro ended 2007 at ¥165, and
thus 5% up on the year. However, the turmoilon the international stock markets at the be-ginning of 2008 and the further increase inexchange rate volatility resulted in broad-based and significant yen gains. This also de-pressed the euro-yen exchange rate. As thisreport went to press, the single currency wastherefore trading slightly lower, at ¥158, thanat the beginning of the year.Log scale

34The economic risks associated with develop-
ments on the financial and real estate mar-
kets meant that market participants came to
a new assessment of UK interest rate trends
in November 2007, particularly as the Bank of
England had trimmed its growth forecast for
2008 in its inflation report. The emerging
turnaround in UK monetary policy was then
confirmed at the beginning of December
when the central bank carried out a base rate
cut to 5.5%. Even after that, the deteriorat-
ing economic outlook for the UK continued
to weigh on the pound sterling. The euro-
pound exchange rate therefore remained on
a continual upward trend during the fourth
quarter and reached a peak of £0.76 in mid-
January 2008. At the end of the reporting
period, however, the euro slipped back again
somewhat to trade at £0.74 against the euro.The accession of Malta and Cyprus to the
euro area means that the effective euro index
is calculated vis-/C224-vis 22 rather than 24 im-
portant trading partners since the beginning
of the year. In the light of movements in bilat-
eral exchange rates, the euro has, on balance,
appreciated against the currencies contained
in the exchange rate index since the end of
October 2007, marking a new high at the be-
ginning of January 2008. When this report
went to press, however, it was trading just
below its level of the beginning of the year
and some 8% above the level it stood at
when monetary union was launched. Taking
into account the different levels of inflation in
the euro area and the economies of the euro
area’s major trading partners, the effective
euro exchange rate was therefore still well
above its longer-term average.
Securities markets and portfolio
transactions
On the securities markets, investors realigned
their portfolios at the turn of the year. Having
remained virtually unchanged overall in the
fourth quarter of 2007 – despite slight fluc-
tuations – yields on ten-year European gov-
ernment bonds have dropped by more than
1/C254percentage point to slightly more than 4%
since the beginning of January as stock mar-
ket prices have fallen. In a very nervous envir-
onment, the decline in yields is not least the

35ginning of 2008 and currently stand at a
four-year high.1In addition, one cannot rule
out the possibility that the financial marketsare expecting large write-downs by banksand the danger of a significant slowdown inthe United States to result in the pace of eco-nomic growth slowing in Europe, too. This isborne out by the fact that real interest ratesin the euro area have fallen significantly sincethe beginning of the year.
The drop in yields on US government bonds,
which started in the third quarter of 2007,has – with just brief interruptions – continuedover the past few months. Against the back-drop of emerging recession fears for theUnited States and large Fed rate cuts, theaverage yield on ten-year government bondshas dropped by almost 1 percentage pointsince the end of September to currently3
3/C254%. As a result, US capital market yields
have declined more sharply than their euro-area counterparts, which means that Euro-pean government bond yields are higher thanthose on US bonds for the first time since2004 and most recently offered an interest-rate advantage of around
1/C253percentage point.
The impact of portfolio shifts in favour of
bonds with no credit risk and revised growthexpectations can also be seen in the down-ward shift in the yield curve for Bunds. Thiscurve has recently inverted in the short tomedium-term maturity segments – a develop-ment temporarily witnessed back in theperiod from November to the beginning ofDecember. Market participants obviously ex-pect interest rates to fall over the aforemen-tioned horizon.Financing conditions for companies on the
bond market became more difficult over thereporting period. Against the backdrop of de-clining government bond yields and risingcorporate bond rates, euro-area bonds in thelowest investment grade rating category,BBB, have seen their spreads widen by two-thirds to 260 basis points since the end ofSeptember. Spreads are thus at a five-yearhigh. At the same time, the iTraxx EuropeIndex, which reflects 125 companies’ creditrisk, has risen significantly.

36compared with the subsequent five-year
period.
The Federal and regional governments in Ger-
many, in their capacity as bond issuers, were
the main beneficiaries of investors’ pro-
nounced risk aversion. Overall, domestic debt
securities worth 33381/C252billion were sold in
the fourth quarter of 2007. Taking into ac-
count lower redemptions, German issuers
raised 332 billion on their domestic market in
the final quarter of the year, while the volume
of outstanding domestic bond securities had
dropped by 3371/C252billion in the previous quar-
ter. In addition, foreign debt securities with a
net value of 36 billion were sold on the Ger-
man bond market, compared with 33 billion
in the third quarter of 2007. On balance, all
these bonds were denominated in foreigncurrency in the fourth quarter, as in the third
quarter. Overall, German bond market issu-
ance thus totalled 338 billion in the fourth
quarter, whereas net redemptions of 335 bil-
lion had been recorded in the previous
period.
Of domestic bond issuers, the public sector
recorded the strongest inflows of funds. In
the period from October to December 2007,
it raised 3281/C252billion on the capital market,
while the Federal Government’s favourable fi-
nancial situation had allowed it to reduce
bond market debt by 331 billion in the third
quarter. Overall, the German Federal Govern-
ment issued 323 billion worth of debt secu-
rities, including five-year Federal notes or
Bobls ( 318 billion), ten-year bonds ( 341/C252bil-
lion) and two-year Federal Treasury notes or
Sch/C228tze ( 311/C252billion). By contrast, net re-
demptions of 30-year bonds, Federal Treasury
financing paper and Federal savings notes
were down on the quarter. State govern-
ments tapped the capital market for 351/C252bil-
lion in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared
with 321/C252billion in the third quarter.
By contrast, domestic credit institutions fur-
ther reduced their domestic capital market
debt by 341/C252billion from October to Decem-
ber, compared with 381/C252billion in the third
quarter. Again, this was largely the result of
large net redemptions of public Pfandbriefe
(38 billion, compared with 314 billion in the
period from July to September). By contrast,
banks recorded net sales of 32 billion worth
of other bank debt securities, which allow
particularly flexible structuring, and this
amounts to a slight drop from the third quar-Investment activity in the German

37ter (34 billion). Specialised credit institutions
raised 311/C252billion in the capital market. In
addition, the reporting period saw small-scalenet issuance of mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 3
1/C252bil-
lion) by banks for the first time since the firstquarter of 2006.
Domestic enterprises stepped up borrowing
on the domestic market in the period fromOctober to December and issued debt secur-ities with a net value of 38 billion. This in-
volved selling 39
1/C252billion worth of commer-
cial paper and redeeming longer-term bonds.
As in the third quarter, non-resident investors,
who have in the past frequently shown apreference for German bonds as safe and li-quid instruments in times of heightened un-certainty, were the only net buyers of debt se-curities on the German market between Oc-tober and December. They invested a nettotal of 383
1/C252billion in German paper, almost
two-thirds of which were used to buy bondsissued by the private sector. By contrast, Ger-man investors sold 345 billion worth of debt
securities. This can be attributed solely to sell-ing by domestic non-banks, which offloadeddebt securities worth 370
1/C252billion net. Do-
mestic credit institutions purchased 3251/C252bil-
lion worth of bond market paper, ultimatelybuying only domestic bonds ( 329
1/C252billion).
Some of this buying represented the takeoverof asset-backed securities issued by the insti-tutions’ own securitisation vehicles.
Developments on the international stock
markets were also dominated by the markedshift in sentiment among financial marketplayers over the year-end. Nevertheless, upuntil the end of last year, stock markets on
both sides of the Atlantic proved relativelyresistant to the distortions on the credit mar-kets, the gloomy economic outlook in theUnited States and the higher oil price. Thefact that the US central bank cut the keyinterest rate by 25 basis points in Octoberand again in December and that market play-ers expected further rate cuts is likely to havebeen a factor.

38prices in Germany and Europe range traded,
while US equities suffered moderate losses.
However, fresh concerns about the extent of
the write-downs which many financial institu-
tions would have to make and spreading
fears of a more pronounced economic slow-
down in the USA resulted in sharply lower
and volatile global stock market prices in
January. A case of fraud at a large European
credit institution as well as fears that mono-
line insurance companies in the USA could
experience difficulties similar to those of
banks further hit share prices. The stock mar-
ket slump was accompanied by increasing
risk aversion and considerably heightened un-
certainty about further price trends.2By con-
trast, the US rate cuts by 75 and 50 basis
points in January had a stabilising effect on
the markets. Another such effect was positive
growth signals for Germany, for instance the
good results of the Ifo business climate index
and an anticipated further increase in corpor-
ate profits overall, which are likely to have
supported prices at the lower level. Since the
end of September, German and European
equities have generally suffered losses of
12% and 14% respectively as measured by
the broad market indices CDAX and Dow
Jones Euro Stoxx, while the US S&P 500 also
slipped by 12%. With the exception of the
CDAX, all the above indices have recently
been trading lower than at the end of De-
cember 2006 and have thus reversed last
year’s gains.Major items of the balance of

39Despite pronounced price volatility, issuance
in the German share market picked up slight-
ly in the fourth quarter. Domestic enterprises
placed new shares worth 33 billion, com-
pared with 31 billion in the third quarter. The
vast majority of these shares were listed equi-
ties. In addition, net sales of foreign shares on
the German market totalled 34 billion.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, domestic credit
institutions represented the main group of
buyers in the equity market. Banks added do-
mestic and foreign equities worth a total of
351/C252billion to their portfolios. Foreign invest-
ors acquired shares to the value of 321/C252bil-
lion, on balance exclusively in the form of
portfolio investments ( 351/C252billion).3Domestic
non-banks reduced their stock market expos-
ure overall ( 31/C252billion), but were net buyers
of foreign equities ( 311/C252billion).
Domestic investment companies recorded in-
flows of funds amounting to just under
39 billion in the fourth quarter, compared
with fund outflows of 38 billion in the pre-
ceding three months. On balance, only the
specialised funds reserved for institutional in-
vestors were able to attract new monies ( 39
billion). By contrast, there were small-scale re-
demptions of mutual fund shares in German
funds open to the general public ( 31/C252billion).
Bond funds ( 32 billion) and money market
funds ( 311/C252billion) suffered the highest net
outflows, although open-ended real-estate
funds were also affected ( 31/C252billion). By con-
trast, mixed securities funds sold 32 billion
worth of shares. In addition, net sales of mu-
tual fund shares in foreign funds on the Ger-
man market totalled 391/C252billion.Domestic non-banks were the biggest buyers
of mutual fund shares in the fourth quarter
(324 billion), adding mutual fund shares is-
sued by domestic and foreign investment
companies to their portfolios in roughly equal
proportions. Foreign investors purchased
31/C252billion of mutual fund shares in the Ger-
man market. By contrast, credit institutions
were net sellers of domestic and foreign mu-
tual fund shares ( 361/C252billion in total).
Direct investment
As in the preceding three quarters of 2007,
direct investments again resulted in net cap-
ital exports between October and December
(327 billion). Outflows thus increased some-
what on the quarter (third quarter: 315 bil-
lion).
This can mainly be attributed to lively invest-
ment activity by German enterprises abroad
(3331/C252billion). They primarily increased their
equity capital investment in their non-
German affiliates ( 318 billion). The main re-
cipient countries were the United States and –
largely as a result of a single transaction –
Russia. In addition, 39 billion flowed abroad,
particularly to the Netherlands, via intra-
group loans. The pace of foreign companies’
investment in German subsidiaries was slower
in the final quarter of 2007 than in the period
from July to September ( 361/C252billion com-
pared with 318 billion).

40Economic conditions
in GermanyMacroeconomic situation
The growth of the German economy was no
more than moderate in the final quarter of
2007. According to initial figures from the
Federal Statistical Office, overall output in-
creased by 0.3% after adjustment for season-
al and calendar effects, compared with 0.7%
in the third quarter. This means that, over the
year as a whole, real gross domestic product
(GDP) went up by 1.8% after calendar adjust-
ment. In its recent flash estimate, the Federal
Statistical Office also confirmed the annual
figure for 2007 of 2.5%, or 2.6% after calen-
dar adjustment, which had been published in
early January. The rather moderate growth in
the fourth quarter is mainly a reflection of a
slower pace in the production sector. Strong
demand stimuli indicate that the expansion-
ary cyclical forces have remained fundamen-
tally intact, however, and that the current
quarterly figure somewhat understates the
underlying cyclical trend. This interpretation is
also supported by the high level of capacity
utilisation, the robust business climate and
the fact that there is still a great willingness to
recruit new staff.
There is no more detailed information on the
expenditure structure in the reporting quarter
at present. Nevertheless, the available indica-
tors suggest that the demand components
which failed to match their figure for the
third quarter – private consumption and con-
struction investment – are those which have
so far exhausted little of their growth poten-
tial. The marked decline in retail sales in the
final quarter may be explained principally by
the fact that the sharp price increases forModerate GDP

41some food items in the third quarter and
sharply rising energy prices did not imply sole-
ly a considerable loss of purchasing power.
Given the increasing risks facing other econ-
omies and the reported problems in the inter-
national banking system, these price surges
have, moreover, evidently resulted in more
cautious consumer spending behaviour. This
is also suggested by the survey conducted
by the consumer research institution, Gesell-
schaft f/C252r Konsumforschung (GfK), which
shows a sharp deterioration in price expect-
ations between August and November and,
with falling expectations for the economy
and incomes, also a perceptible decline in the
propensity to purchase. The fact that enter-
prises and the public sector had previously
been quite subdued in placing new orders
and that the trend in housing construction
was still decidedly weak had a dampening ef-
fect on construction investment in the final
quarter. Not least, the expiry of the declining-
balance depreciation facility for movables at
the end of the year is likely to have meant
that there was a contrasting further expan-
sion of investment in machinery and equip-
ment in the fourth quarter.
Subdued final domestic demand is also likely
to be one reason for the decline in imports in
the fourth quarter. Another factor in this con-
nection is likely to have been that enterprises
reduced their inventories in the reporting
quarter and exports were no longer increas-
ing so sharply. Nonetheless, export perform-
ance remained a major pillar of growth, even
though there were fewer new orders from
the United States owing to the cooling of the
US economy and the exchange rate makingexports more costly. Major sales markets for
German products – the euro area, central and
eastern Europe, the emerging economies in
East Asia, and the OPEC countries – remained
in robust economic condition, however. From
an accounting perspective, foreign trade is
likely to have generated a noticeably positive
contribution to overall economic growth.
Sectoral profile
During the final quarter, industry only slightly
increased the high output level achieved in
the summer. On a quarterly average, there
was still a seasonally adjusted rise of 0.8%,
however, compared with an earlier increase
in industrial output of more than 2.0%.

42mediate and capital goods sectors continued
to increase markedly at the end of the year,
output growth in the consumer goods sectors
was somewhat more limited. This reflected
the fact that, given the strained consumer cli-
mate, fewer consumer durables were being
sold domestically at the end of the period
under review.According to the Ifo Institute, the manufac-
turing sector continued to record a very high
level of capacity utilisation overall. On an an-
nual average of 2007, the degree of utilisa-
tion was not only up on the year but also well
above its most recent cyclical peak in 2000.
Taking into account the fact, too, that it is
precisely during the past two years that enter-
prises have considerably expanded their cap-
acities, industrial activity may be said to be
decidedly positive at present. Capacity short-
ages are evident mainly in the capital goods
sector. By contrast, producers of intermediate
and durable consumption goods had to scale
back the utilisation of their production facil-
ities in 2007 following the peak levels (owing
to special effects) reached in both sectors in
2006.
Construction output fell by a seasonally ad-
justed 0.6% in the fourth quarter and was
therefore back at the depressed level of the
second quarter. In sectoral terms, the fact
that construction investment made no pro-
gress in its core area in the second half of
2007 was due equally to the building industry
and civil engineering. Output in the finishing
trades is unlikely to have been much more fa-
vourable with virtually no change in the sea-
sonally adjusted number of hours worked in
the third quarter, for example, (more recent
data are unavailable at present), while con-
struction output went up by 0.5% during the
same period but went back down again in
the following quarter.
A number of dampening factors are likely to
have affected value added in the services sec-
tors in the fourth quarter. Christmas trading2000 = 100, seasonally adjusted, quarterly

43failed to meet the retail trade’s expectations
and the services of the transport and logistics
enterprises may have been temporarily affect-
ed somewhat by the train drivers’ strikes at
Deutsche Bahn. Another factor was that the
financial market turbulence and the associ-
ated discussions on economic risks since
August placed a strain on the business ac-
tivity of at least a part of the financial and
business-related services sector.
Employment and unemployment
The rise in employment strengthened again
somewhat in the final quarter of 2007. The
number of persons in work went up by a sea-
sonally adjusted 106,000, or 0.3%, to 39.88
million. The year-on-year increase amounted
to 617,000, or 1.6%. By November, employ-
ment subject to social security contributions
had gone up by as much as 2.0%. Industry, in
particular, further increased its number of
employees. In addition, there was an expan-
sion of the “finance, renting and business ser-
vices” sector, in which the hiring out of la-
bour is also recorded statistically. According
to the available leading indicators, the posi-
tive development in the labour market could
continue in the more immediate future. There
was only a slight seasonally adjusted decline
in the number of job vacancies reported to
the Federal Labour Agency. The more broadly
based BA-X index of non-government-assisted
jobs, which captures all the vacancies in the
primary labour market known to the Federal
Employment Agency, showed a further in-
crease, however. Not least, the Ifo employ-
ment barometer also indicates that industrialenterprises are planning to recruit additional
personnel.
Unemployment continued to fall at an accel-
erated rate in the fourth quarter. In seasonally
adjusted terms, there was a decline of
156,000 compared with the third quarter, fol-
lowing a decrease of roughly 110,000 in each
of the two preceding quarters. One reason
for this might be that, up to the day of the
official count in December, there had not yet
been any weather-induced restrictions in the
outdoor occupations. Furthermore, seasonal
short-time working benefits, which had been
introduced the year before, may have damp-
ened the seasonal fluctuations somewhat.
The number of persons out of work, at 3.57
million, was 623,000 lower than in the same
period of 2006. Three-fifths of the decline
was accounted for by job seekers receiving
social benefits under the Third Book of the
Social Security Code (SGB III)), primarily
the short-term unemployed, and two-fifths
by unemployed job seekers subject to the
Second Book of the Social Security Code
(SGB II), who are mostly long-term un-
employed. Owing to the relatively sharp
decline in the case of the short-term un-
employed, there has been a marked increase
in the percentage of long-term unemployed
among those out of work; the figure was
roughly 70% in the fourth quarter. However,
this was due in part to the shortening of
the period of entitlement to unemployment
benefit, which came into effect at the begin-
ning of 2007, and the fact that job seekers
were therefore placed on the basic allowance
(maybe plus a temporary add-on benefit)
sooner than before.Further increase

44The quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate went down from 8.9%
to 8.5% and showed a further fall to 8.1% in
January 2008. In the final quarter of 2007,
the internationally comparable standardised
unemployment rate stood at 7.9%. Although
this was noticeably lower than one year be-
fore – the figure for the fourth quarter of
2006 was 9.2% – it was still 0.7 percentage
point higher than the average of the other
euro-area countries and was, in fact, 4.1 per-
centage points higher than the average of
the three euro-area countries with the lowest
unemployment rate. This indicates that the
German labour market is in much better
shape than it was even one year ago, al-
though the unemployment rate for certain
segments of the workforce is still at an un-
acceptably high level. Given the existing
heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, a
moderate wage policy accompanied by flex-
ible rates of pay will still be crucial to ensure
that firms actually carry out their plans to ex-
pand employment.
Wages and prices
On an annual average, the rise in labour costs
in the economy as a whole was no more than
comparatively slight in 2007 – despite the
large claims at the beginning of the 2007 pay
round and some relatively large settlements
in industry. At 1.3%, the increase in negoti-
ated rates of pay, when calculated on a
monthly basis, was no higher than in 2006.
Calculations on an hourly basis produce a
similar picture. While negotiated pay rates in
the production sector went up by 2.3%, theSeasonally adjusted, quarterly

vices sector, pay settlements providing for no– or only small – wage increases in 2007 werestill in effect. In other cases, negotiations last-ing several months led to no agreement, as inthe retail trade. The last significant agreementconcluded in 2007 was in the insurance in-dustry, where the parties engaged in pay bar-gaining agreed that remuneration be in-creased by 3.0% in January 2008 followingfour months with no increase and a one-offpayment in December 2007. With the agree-ment running for a total of 25 months, asecond staged increase of 1.6% is scheduledfor January 2009. Furthermore, there will bea further one-off payment in July 2008.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the year-on-year rise in negotiated rates of pay, at 1.1%,was per se smaller than in the third quarter
(+1.7%). The lower rate of increase was,however, due in part to a baseline effectowing to one-off payments having raised thereference figure for the final quarter of 2006.Cuts in special payments in the public sectorand at public sector banks were an additionalfactor. If one-off payments and additionalagreements are excluded, the year-on-yearrate in the fourth quarter of 2007 remainedunchanged at 1.7%.

According to the real estate pri ce in dices calculate d by 
the Bun desbank on the basis of Bulwien Gesa A G data,1
the pri ce of newly constru cted housin g rose sli ghtly 
in 2007 – as in the previous year. The avera ge pri ce 
of existin g property, in contrast, remaine d the same. 
There were only minor differen ces between both east-
ern an d western Germany an d between terra ced an d 
owner-o ccupie d housin g. Prior to 200 6, house pri ces in 
Germany ha d been fallin g sli ghtly. The reversal in the 
pri ce tren d may be cyclical in ori gin; a dded to this were 
rapi dly risin g costs for the constru ction of new build-
ings. The pri ce of housin g constru ction rose by 2.3 % in 
200 6, mainly owin g to the in crease d cost of building 
materials; it rose a gain in 2007 by 7.2 %, not least owin g 
to the in crease in the stan dard rate of VAT from 1 6% 
to 19 %.The Bun desbank’s real estate pri ce in dices are base d 
on the pri ces of typi cal properties (for example, sellin g 
pri ces of hi gh-quality terra ced housin g in avera ge to 
goo d lo cations with approximate livin g spa ce of 100 
square metres) in 125 towns an d cities (100 in western 
Germany an d 25 in eastern Germany). The lo cal data by 
type of building are wei ghte d together with population 
break downs from 2005. The estimate d costs of newly 
complete d buildings from the constru ction statisti cs for 
2004 to 200 6 are use d for wei ghin g to gether the data 
on the group “new owner-o ccupie d housin g an d ter-
raced houses”. For existin g properties, the per centa ges

relation to the total livin g spa ce in Germany pursuant 
to the 2002 mi crocensus survey an d the constru ction 
statisti cs for 2001 to 2005 are use d.
The decision to pu blish these real estate pri ce in dices in 
2002 was essentially motivate d by the in creasin g discrep-
ancy between the growin g interest in su ch in dicators 
and/or their availa bility an d quality.3 The Bun desbank’s

however. Internationally, quarterly data are stan dard.

482007 will come into effect. Furthermore, pay
agreements will be expiring in a number
major sectors – above all, central and local
government, the iron and steel industry, the
chemicals industry, textiles and textile prod-
ucts, and restaurants and hotels. Negotiations
in the metal-working industry are scheduled
for the second half of the year. The scale of
the claims, as far as is known at present, will
go beyond that made initially in the last
round of negotiations in some cases, with the
loss of purchasing power in 2007 being one
of the reasons cited for this. It should be
noted, however, that the price increases of
2007, owing to their strong fiscal and exter-
nal components, have scarcely increased the
(nominal) scope for income distribution.
On the external side, price impulses, in par-
ticular, strengthened again perceptibly in the
fourth quarter owing to the rise in the cost of
crude oil. Seasonally adjusted import prices
were not quite 2% higher than in the third
quarter, in which import prices had gone up by
0.4%. The increase in the case of energy was
as much as 14.3%. However, the appreciation
of the euro against the currencies of major
trading partners made other exports 0.5%
cheaper in seasonally adjusted terms. As was
the case in the third quarter, lower prices for
intermediate goods as well as for durables and
capital goods more than offset the higher cost
of food and animal feed. Imports were just
over 3% more expensive year on year overall;
excluding energy, prices were 0.2% lower. As
export prices increased no more than moder-
ately in seasonally adjusted terms, there was a
marked deterioration in the terms of trade.
The year-on-year figure was a clear -1.7%There was stronger upward pressure on prices
at the industrial producer level. The seasonally
adjusted prices of goods intended for domes-
tic sale went up by 1%. This was due not only
to sharp rises in the cost of energy, but also
to quite marked increases in the price of
other goods. The strong pressure on prices
continued especially for products of the food
and beverages industry. Upward pressure also
persisted in the case of agricultural producer
prices. The ongoing unfavourable price trend
for agricultural products was also the main
reason for the annual rate of wholesale price
inflation, at 6.6% in January 2008, being the
highest since June 1982. The year-on-year in-
crease in factory gate prices went up from
1.2% to 2.2%. Excluding energy, the increase
is reduced slightly from 2.5% to 2.3%. Prices
for construction continued to rise in the final
quarter of 2007; they were 6.4% higher in
year-on-year terms. The sharp rise in con-
struction prices, which began in 2006, has
been reflected in house prices only to a very
limited extent so far. (For house price devel-
opments in 2007, see the explanatory notes
on page 46-47.)
In the final quarter of 2007, seasonally adjust-
ed consumer prices, at 0.8%, rose even
somewhat more sharply than in the third
quarter. The increase in food prices was ex-
ceptionally large at 3.7%. The price trend
was particularly marked in the case of dairy
and cereal products. For example, compared
with the previous quarter, consumers had to
pay over 20% more for white farm cheese
(Speisequark ) and over 10% more for wheat
flour. In December, there were initial down-
ward adjustments to the price of butter, how-Sharp energy-

49ever. Nevertheless, the unabated sharp rise in
wholesale food prices in January 2008 indi-
cates that the generally unfavourable price
trend in this area will continue for the time
being. Furthermore, the cost of energy went
up by 2% owing to higher crude oil prices.
Upward pressure on prices also intensified
somewhat in the case of industrial goods.
The price trend in services and housing rents
was still comparatively moderate, however.
Owing to the exceptionally sharp quarter-on-
quarter increase in consumer prices, the year-
on-year rate of price increase went up from
2.1% in the third quarter to 2.8% in the
fourth quarter. This was the highest rate of
inflation since early 1994. At that time, how-
ever, the sharp rise in prices affected all the
components of the consumer price index and
may be interpreted as an after-effect of the
excessive rise in wages during the unification
boom. In the present case, the sharp price in-
creases have hitherto been concentrated on
energy and food, which have gone up 8.6%
and 5.6% respectively in year-on-year terms.
Furthermore, the increase in the standard
rate of VAT from 16% to 19% at the start of
2007 is still having an effect on some cat-
egories of goods.
Based on the old 2000 basket of goods, the
Federal Statistical Office has estimated a year-
on-year increase in consumer prices of 2.7%
in January 2008. In seasonally adjusted terms,
this corresponds to a 0.4% rise in comparison
with December 2007. This would give an an-
nual Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
(HICP) rate of 3.0%. The final January figures
will be published at the end of February andwill then refer to the 2005 basket of goods.
In addition, various changes to the method-
ology, especially concerning the way in which
price developments are shown in seasonal
terms, will become effective.
Orders received and outlook
Despite the slowdown in growth towards the
end of 2007, which was by no means surpris-
ing, the future outlook for the economy has
not significantly deteriorated. Nevertheless,
the risk factors that have been making the
economic outlook less certain than usual
since the middle of last year continue to exist.
They have, in fact, become more significant
in some respects, such as the scenario of a
marked cyclical slowdown in the United
States. So far, however, the probable impact
on the German economy has remained very
limited. Neither extensive revisions to non-
financial corporations’ budgets nor major dis-
ruptions to households’ confidence have
been identifiable so far, for example. On the
whole, the German banking system has
coped well with the turbulence of the past
few months and has maintained its stability
and functional viability. This means that there
is still the prospect that domestic demand –
which was adversely affected in the fourth
quarter by general uncertainty and the strong
upward pressure on prices – will again be
shaped more by the potential for recovery
justified in terms of the fundamentals.
This applies most of all to private consump-
tion, which was curbed not only by the sharp
increases in prices at the end of the year butPrices rises

50also by the suddenly gloomier expectations
for prices and incomes. In the meantime,
households’ sentiment has recovered slightly
and the propensity to purchase large con-
sumption items has increased again. Precau-
tionary saving, which was the prevailing mo-
tive in the fourth quarter, is therefore likely to
have become somewhat less important. Pri-
vate consumption might therefore benefit
more in future, too, from the ongoing strong
revival in the labour market and the more fa-
vourable income prospects.
At the start of the year, what will be “miss-
ing” is the volume of investment in machin-
ery and equipment that was brought forward
to last year owing to the expiry of the
declining-balance depreciation facility for
movables. Looking at the high level of cap-acity utilisation in many sectors of industry,
there are a large number of enterprises which
still need to procure new machinery and
equipment, however. Given the reserves of
orders, the reach of which remained at a con-
stantly high level on balance in 2007 despite
the buoyancy of investment, industry can
only meet the increasing customer needs on
time by means of a further expansion of pro-
duction capacity. Generally speaking, the pro-
pensity to invest will be boosted by the fact
that the business tax reform that entered into
force at the beginning of the year will help to
improve the conditions for investment in Ger-
many.
In actual fact, industrial enterprises have re-
corded a sharp growth in new orders of late.
The seasonally adjusted volume of orders in
the fourth quarter was 5% up on the preced-
ing three-month period. The exceptional
peak in orders in November was due princi-
pally to numerous large orders in the air
transport equipment and the railway and
tramway locomotives construction sectors as
well as in the steel industry. Even after this ef-
fect is eliminated, however, there was still a
quite considerable increase of approximately
3% in the volume of orders that will have an
impact on output over the shorter term. The
persistently favourable demand situation in
order-based industry is revealed, moreover,
by the fact that the Order Capacity Index –
after a dip in the third quarter – was latterly
even up on its previous record high of the
second quarter. The sharp (61/C252%) increase in
new export orders indicates that German in-
dustry has been able to well maintain its mar-
ket position even under difficult underlyingSeasonally adjusted

51conditions. This is due, above all, to the fact
that capital goods producers are in a strongposition, which is due, not least, to the at-tractive range of goods on offer. Despitesomewhat more subdued global growth andless favourable price competitiveness in thedollar area, export-oriented industry is look-ing optimistically to the future – which is evi-dent, moreover, in the persistently favourableexport expectations.
Demand for construction also picked up
sharply in the fourth quarter. The average vol-ume of orders in October and November was12
1/C252% up on the third quarter. This was due
mainly to a number of large orders placed byindustrial customers and the public sector inOctober. The increase in demand for indus-trial construction should be seen in connec-tion with domestic producers’ capacity exten-sions, however, and, therefore also reflects anunderlying trend. By contrast, orders forhousing construction remained at a low level.
The German economy remains in robust
shape overall. The weakness of domestic de-mand in the fourth quarter was more tem-porary in nature. Furthermore, the leading in-dicators suggest that, although the changesin the exchange rate pattern and the slow-down in the US economy are per se curbing
the momentum of exports, they will not se-verely impede it. This means that the mainelements underpinning the upturn in Ger-many remain intact. Despite the obvious riskpotential, the shift of emphasis to domesticexpansionary forces, which is expected froma cyclical perspective, remains the most prob-able scenario.Volume, 2000 = 100,

52Public financesGeneral government budget
The public finance situation showed a further
significant improvement last year. After the
general government deficit fell to 1.6% of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006, a
balanced government budget was achieved
in 2007 for the first time since German reuni-
fication according to provisional data from
the Federal Statistical Office from January
2008.1
The favourable general economic setting and
the further strong increase in revenue from
profit-related taxes, which is subject to large
and erratic fluctuations, contributed in part
to the deficit reduction. However, the im-
provement in the financial situation is mostly
due to structural factors, such as notably the
increases in taxes and social security contribu-
tions that came into force at the beginning of
2007 and moderate expenditure growth (see
box on pages 54 and 55).
Government debt is likely to have risen slight-
ly last year. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio
looks to have declined by about 21/C252percent-
age points compared with 2006 to around
65% owing to the robust nominal economic
growth. While this would be well below the
historical high of 67.8% that was reached in
2005, it still clearly exceeded the 60% refer-
ence value stipulated in the EC Treaty .
In 2007, government revenue amounted to
not quite 44% of GDP . Thus the ratio hardly

53rose at all on the year, although, on balance,
the fiscal measures taken led to considerablyhigher revenue. The main reason for this wasthat major macroeconomic reference vari-ables for government revenue, such as grosswages and salaries and above all pre-tax pri-vate consumption, increased more slowlythan nominal GDP . However, tax receipts in-creased strongly, not least as a result of therise in the standard rate of VAT and of insur-ance tax. By contrast, social security contribu-tions decreased slightly because the loweringof the contribution rate to the Federal Em-ployment Agency far outweighed the rise incontribution rates to the statutory health andpension insurance schemes and income sub-ject to contributions only rose moderately.Revenue from profit-related taxes continuedto grow much more strongly than wouldhave been expected given legislative changesand the growth in entrepreneurial and invest-ment income, which are used as indicatorsfor the tax assessment base.
Government expenditure grew by a moder-
ate 1% last year, which meant that in relationto GDP it went down perceptibly to justunder 44%. The positive general economicsetting made a significant contribution to thisdecrease. It not only led to a decline in theratio as a result of the stronger growth ofnominal GDP in the denominator but alsothanks to distinctly lower labour market-related expenditure, particularly as a result ofthe favourable employment trend. The mutedincrease in pension and personnel expend-iture in comparison to nominal GDP alsoplayed its part in the decline in the ratio. Themoderate overall wage rises were reflected,in much the same way as on the revenue
side, in a reduction in the ratio because ad-justment of many social security benefits isclosely linked to the (preceding) developmentofper capita earnings.
General government is likely to record a re-
newed deficit in 2008. Besides a furtherlowering of the contribution rate to the Fed-eral Employment Agency to 3.3%, the devel-As a percentage of GDP

54Deutsche BundesbankThe structural development of public finances –
results of the disaggregated framework for 2007
The public finance situation in Germany improved markedly over
the past year. According to provisional data from the Federal
Statistical Office from January 2008, a balanced general govern-
ment budgetary position (as defined in the national accounts)
was achieved, following a deficit ratio of 1.6% in 2006. Using the
disaggregated framework for analysing public finances1,i ti s
possible to estimate the role played by cyclical and specific tem-
porary effects. Structural changes in the revenue and expend-
iture ratios and their major determinants can also be identified.
The main results of this analysis for 2007 are presented below.2
The decline of 1.6 percentage points (pp) in the deficit ratio over
the past year was due, in part, to the favourable cyclical develop-
ment of the economy. Applying the standard adjustment proced-
ure used within the European System of Central Banks, this pro-
duced a positive impact of 0.3 pp. However, there were no clearly
identifiable temporary special effects influencing the decline in
the deficit (such as the proceeds from UMTS sales in the past).
Thus, the structural fiscal balance as defined in the disaggre-
gated framework – which is adjusted for these two effects –
improved by 1.2 pp in relation to trend GDP.
While the unadjusted revenue ratio increased only marginally,
structural revenue grew perceptibly in relation to trend GDP
(+0.5 pp). The ratio was boosted slightly by the fact that the – as
usual – positive fiscal drag resulting from income tax progression
outweighed the negative impact in the case of excise taxes,
which are largely volume-based (+ 0.1 pp overall). As in previous
years, the negative structural decoupling of the macroeconomic
reference variables from GDP growth had a countervailing effect
(-0.3 pp). For example, when viewed in isolation, the (trend to-
wards) comparatively small increases in gross wages and salaries
and pre-tax private consumption reduced the ratio of revenue
from social contributions and wage and turnover tax to trend
GDP. This was not fully offset by the additional revenue from
profit-related taxes owing to the trend of faster rising entrepre-
neurial and investment income in relation to GDP. The rise in the
structural revenue ratio was attributable mainly to legislative
changes. The increase of 3 pp to 19% in the standard rate of VAT
and insurance tax and the rise of 0.4 pp and 0.5 pp on average in
contribution rates to the statutory pension and health insurance
schemes, respectively, had an impact in this respect. Conversely,
the contribution rate to the Federal Employment Agency was re-duced by 2.3 pp. Legislative changes, including a number of
quantitively less significant measures, led to net revenue in-
creases of 0.6% of trend GDP.
Most of the change experienced in the structural revenue ratio
in 2007 can be explained by the three factors mentioned above
(fiscal drag, the structural decoupling of the macroeconomic ref-
erence variables from GDP and legislative changes). The part re-
maining unexplained in the standardised procedure (residual)
came to a total of 0.1 pp. Special factors reducing receipts from
turnover tax were offset by factors boosting revenue from
profit-related taxes. As in previous years, revenue from profit-
related taxes grew at a faster pace than was to be expected
given the development of entrepreneurial and investment in-
come (which serves as the macroeconomic reference variable for
these taxes in the cyclical adjustment procedure). This may owe
something to the fact that large tax prepayments were accom-
panied by high net backpayments for earlier years. Another fun-
damental problem is that the reference variable taken from the
national accounts does not adequately capture fluctuations in
the actual tax base. In contrast to 2006, the increase in turnover
tax receipts after adjustment for legislative changes was, how-
ever, lower than expected in view of the macroeconomic base
applied. Tax-driven advance purchases of consumer goods in
2006 are likely to have contributed to this by correspondingly re-
ducing the proportion of goods in total consumption in 2007
subject to the standard rate of VAT, which was increased at the
beginning of 2007. This reduces the average tax rate per se
(which is derived from the revenue generated), a fact which is
not taken into account in the standardised calculations. How-
ever, this effect alone is not sufficient to explain the unfavour-
able development in turnover tax. Tax evasion may also have in-
creased in connection with the tax hike.
At 0.8 pp, the decline in the structural expenditure ratio was sig-
nificantly smaller than that in the unadjusted ratio. This was due,
in part, to adjustment for the sizeable cyclically induced reduc-
tion in labour market expenditure. In addition, real GDP growth
in 2007 was perceptibly stronger than that of trend GDP. The de-
nominator of the unadjusted expenditure ratio thus increased
more markedly that that of the structural expenditure ratio. The
interest expenditure ratio remained at roughly the same level as
in 2006. Although the debt ratio fell perceptibly, the average

55interest rate on government debt rose for the first time since the
turn of the century. By contrast, the structural ratio of other ex-penditure (primary expenditure) decreased significantly. As inprevious years, expenditure on old-age pensions made a majorcontribution to this development as the annual average increasein pensions was very modest (+0.3%) and there was only a grad-ual rise in the number of pension recipients. Furthermore, labourmarket expenditure fell owing not only to cyclical conditions butalso to the marked decline in its medium-term trend. Lastly, themoderate changes in negotiated rates of pay and the continuedreduction in central, state and local government staff numbersalso caused the compensation of government employees to fallsignificantly in relation to trend GDP. Overall, therefore, themuted pattern of wage developments not only depressed rev-
enue but was also “automatically” reflected in a declining ratioon the expenditure side as numerous social benefits are linked towage developments and they also form the basis for negotiatedpay rates in the public sector. This was offset to only a minordegree by the sharp rise in investment expenditure per se .
On balance, it is clear that the noticeable decline in the deficit
ratio in 2007 is attributable to various factors. Alongside thepositive cyclical influence, it was mainly the (also structurally)limited growth in expenditure and the higher revenue resultingfrom legislative changes that led to this very favourable develop-ment.

56opment in profit-related taxes is particularly
likely to contribute to the deterioration in the
budgetary situation. First, the marked tax
losses in connection with the reform of busi-
ness taxation have to be taken into account.
Second, following the sharp growth rates of
the past few years, revenue is now likely to
have reached a level that is perceptibly higher
than normal. Furthermore, as a result of the
financial market turmoil, there is an addition-
al risk of a rather weak development of
profit-related taxes. Overall, the general gov-
ernment revenue ratio will decrease signifi-
cantly despite additional revenue due to the
effects of tax progression. The expenditure
ratio is also likely to contract as the growth
particularly of pension and labour market ex-
penditure is likely to remain subdued as
things currently stand. However, this will
probably not be sufficient to completely off-
set the fall in the revenue ratio.
Germany’s budget last year was also balanced
in structural terms (ie after adjustment for
cyclical influences and temporary effects),
meaning that the medium-term fiscal object-
ive set by the Federal Government was there-
fore already achieved in 2007. Following the
dropping of the excessive deficit procedure in
June 2007, an additional important provision
of the EU fiscal framework has thus been
met. If this course of sound public finances is
maintained, then the debt-to-GDP ratio could
also quickly be brought below the reference
value of 60% defined in the EC Treaty. This
would mean that a further central demand of
the European fiscal rules would be met. Fur-
thermore, the future budgetary strains result-
ing from the ageing of the population wouldthen be offset by an easing of the debt ser-
vice burden.
The renewed incurrence of a deficit in 2008
envisaged by the Federal Government in the
latest update to the stability programme is
not fully compatible with the European fiscal
framework. This is underscored by the fact
that the programme was based on the as-
sumption that the macroeconomic setting
would be rather positive and revenue from
profit-related taxes would remain at an ex-
ceptionally high level in 2008.
A further loosening of fiscal policy, ie on top
of the tax relief granted by the lowering of
the contribution rate to the Federal Employ-
ment Agency and the business tax reform, as
has recently been adopted in the United
States, for example, to avert the threat of re-
cession, currently does not seem appropriate
in Germany. Although the macroeconomic
risks have risen slightly in Germany, too, over-
all the domestic economy remains in robust
shape and within the corridor of normal cap-
acity utilisation. Therefore, there is no justifi-
cation for jeopardising the consolidation that
has been painstakingly achieved over the past
few years. Furthermore, it may generally be
doubted – not least given past experience –
that attempts to actively steer the German
economy by fiscal means will be crowned
with success. As a rule, it appears to be more
appropriate, given a structurally sound finan-
cial situation, to let the automatic stabilisers
take effect. This is also envisaged in the Euro-
pean fiscal framework. In the light of Germa-
ny’s particular situation at the present time,

Budgetary development of central,

Tax revenue
In 2007 tax revenue3rose steeply (+101/C252%),
although the growth declined during the
course of the year (see chart on this page and
table on page 58). In addition to the weaken-
ing of the underlying dynamics, special fac-
tors also contributed to this. The main rea-
sons for the significant growth in the year as
a whole were first the increase in VAT receipts
as a result of the rate rise at the start of 2007.
Second, income tax revenue also rose consid-
erably in the wake of the buoyant macro-
economic momentum. The 2007 outturn ex-
ceeded the official forecast from November
2006 by a total of 321 billion, although it was
311/C252billion below the expectations of the lat-
est estimate from November 2007.
Specifically, wage tax revenue increased by
71/C252% on the year. In addition to the increase
in gross wages and salaries, this was mainly
due to the reduction in child benefit pay-
ments, which are deducted from cash re-
ceipts, and to tax progression effects. But the
restrictions on the standard travel allowance
for commuters for recognising travel ex-
penses between home and work also played
a role. Various cases are currently pending at
the Federal Constitution Court questioning
the constitutionality of the revised rules, and
a decision is expected on the matter this year.This being so, since September 2007 tax
payers have been permitted to carry on claim-
ing these tax-free allowances during the year
again under the status quo ante .4In addition
to the smaller reduction in child benefits and
a moderate wage development towards the
end of the year, this may have contributed to
the slight fall in growth in wage tax receipts

58ter. Revenue from profit-related taxes5in-
creased steeply again in 2007 (+ 211/C252%), al-
though their rate of growth decreased in the
course of the year. However, the decrease in
the rates is overstated by a significant year-
on-year decline in the first few months of
2008 in the volume of payments deducted
from cash receipts for grants to homeowners,
which were being phased out, (in particular
in the main payment month of March) and in
refunds to employees. Exceptional factors
may also have distorted the pattern in the
case of corporation tax. Overall, revenue
from profit-related taxes also grew more
strongly in 2007 than was implied by the fi-
nancial impact of legislative changes and the
increase in the macroeconomic reference
variables (entrepreneurial and investment in-
come) – albeit to a much smaller extent thanin 2006. The financial market turmoil has
thus far had no discernible impact on the
development of tax revenue.
The strong increase in revenue from
consumption-related taxes was driven by the
rise in the standard rate of VAT (and also of
insurance tax). However, the year-on-year
rates of expansion declined during the course
of 2007. This is likely to be particularly due to
the fact that in the latter part of 2006 the
cash flow statistics were boosted by precipi-
tated purchases ahead of the announced in-Tax revenue

59crease in the standard rate of VAT. Turnover
tax development was disappointing in thatthe pre-tax assessment base hardly increased,particularly as a result of continued weak pri-vate consumption, and the result was alsolower than was to be expected when takingthis subdued consumption development intoaccount. However, turnover tax receipts havebeen fairly volatile over the past few yearsand have matched developments in themacroeconomic reference variables only to alimited extent. Energy tax revenue – the mostimportant central government excise duty interms of volume – fell by 2
1/C252% in the wake
of higher energy prices, the resulting con-sumer restraint but doubtless also on accountof the mild winter in 2007.
In the latest official tax estimate – which also
forms the basis of the 2008 Federal budget –total revenue for the current year (includinglocal government taxes) is expected to in-crease by 3%. This takes into account esti-mated shortfalls of around 36
1/C252billion result-
ing from the business tax reform, whichentered into force at the beginning of 2008.A certain counterswing to the extremegrowth of revenue from profit-related taxesover the past years was also factored into theestimate. Since the starting basis for 2008has turned out to be lower than forecast inthe November estimate and the macroeco-nomic outlook is now subject to greater un-certainty, overall there is a risk of revenueshortfalls.Central government budget
Central government recorded a budget def-
icit of just over 314
1/C252billion in 2007. This
exactly matched the amount envisaged in thesupplementary budget. On the revenue sidethere were shortfalls totalling 34 billion due
to a moderate undershooting of the levelexpected in the November tax estimate,backpayments to the EU and a lower-than-expected compensatory amount paid by theFederal Employment Agency. Half of theshortfalls was offset by increased revenuefrom asset realisations, payments from the EUand inflows of resources from the liquidationof the flood disaster fund. Expenditure in-creased by almost 3
1/C252% on the year, chiefly
as a result of the recently introduced VAT-financed grant to the Federal EmploymentAgency, but, like revenue, it remained almost32 billion below the estimate in the budget
plans. In addition to savings on interest ex-penditure and on drawings on underwritingcommitments, lower expenditure on benefitsfor the long-term unemployed and paymentsto offset the miners’ pension insurance funddeficit also contributed to budget relief.
Overall, central government’s deficit almost
halved in comparison to 2006. At almost314
1/C252billion, net borrowing in the actual
budget implementation was well below totalinvestment expenditure (just over 326 billion).
However, this would not have been achievedwithout the extensive relief from asset realisa-tions in the central government budget andthe post office pension fund. Thus, despitethe favourable course of development in theeconomy as a whole, the budgetary situation2008 character-

ernment budget consolidation is still a long
way from being achieved.
The 2008 Federal budget, approved by the
Bundestag at the end of November, envisages
only a slight decline in the deficit to 312 bil-
lion. Compared with 2007, expenditure
growth of 41/C252% is estimated, almost half of
which can be attributed to grants to the post
office pension fund which, following the ex-
haustion of the remaining proceeds from se-
curitisation last year, are now quantified at 36
billion. However, in addition, current expend-
iture in other areas was also increased, while
investment is expected to fall by 311/C252billion
to3241/C252billion. However, asset realisationsof3121/C252billion are also envisaged. Without
these extraordinary receipts, the borrowing
limit defined in Article 115 of the Basic Law
will only just be observed this year. If, as the
Federal Government envisages in its 2008
Annual Economic Report, overall economic
growth remains below expectations and fur-
ther tax revenue risks materialise, the outlook
for the Federal budget would worsen. As
things now stand, despite the current situ-
ation being somewhat worse than was
hoped for, the budget benchmarks still seem
achievable. However, against the backdrop of
a waning macroeconomic momentum and
given the increases in expenditure that have
been approved, the envisaged goal of achiev-
ing a balanced budget by 2011 seems a tall
order.
The deficit of the central government subsid-
iary budgets amounted to 33 billion in 2007,
which was 32 billion less than in 2006. In the
case of the post office pension fund, as
in 2006, proceeds from a securitisation of
claims, treated as a loan, were used up, re-
sulting in a renewed deficit of 341/C252billion.
The flood disaster fund also recorded a deficit
as a result of the remaining 31 billion of re-
sources being distributed. As in 2006, on bal-
ance the ERP Special Fund, which was re-
organised mid-year under the aegis of the
KfW group, recorded a net borrowing re-
quirement of 31/C252billion. By contrast, the Re-
demption Fund for Inherited Liabilities record-
ed a surplus of just under 31 billion, mainly
thanks to receiving part of the Bundesbank’s
profit in early 2007, which must be used for
redemption, while the interest on the debt is
paid directly from the Federal budget. The€b n

posted an even more favourable result. Its
Federal government grants, in the amount of
32 billion, are not planned to be spent until
during the following years.
State government budgets6
The budgetary outturn of state government
in 2007 improved by 313 billion compared
with 2006 and, for the first time since 1969,
recorded a surplus ( 33 billion). By contrast,
the draft budgets at the beginning of 2007
had envisaged a total deficit of 3151/C252billion.
This extremely positive outturn was principal-
ly attributable to the strong increase in total
revenue (71/C252%) fuelled by the rise in tax re-
ceipts. Following a subdued growth pattern
in the preceding years, however, expenditure
likewise increased at a somewhat faster pace
(+2%). While personnel expenditure rose
only comparatively slightly (+1/C252%) despite
higher transfers to the reserves for state gov-
ernment civil servants’ non-contributory pen-
sions, transfers to local government, which
are generally linked to the level of tax revenue
generated by state government, climbed ap-
preciably and alone probably accounted for
just over half of the rise in state government
expenditure.
The expected shortfalls in profit-related taxes
in 2008, not least as a result of the business
tax reform and the likely increases in expend-
iture – also on account of public sector pay
rises – are likely to lead to a less favourable
outturn for state government budgets. The
budgets, which have now largely been ad-
justed to the latest tax estimate, envisage afiscal deficit of 36 billion for 2008 as a whole.
However, the fiscal situation of the individual
state governments differs greatly. Neverthe-
less, seven out of 16 states have presented
budgets for this year with no new net bor-
rowing and four more plan this by 2011 at
the latest. The remaining five states have, as
yet, not published any firm target dates for
achieving this goal. These include Bremen,
Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein whose
budgets, although these states already have
high per capita debt, continue to exceed the
constitutional ceiling for new borrowing.
Demographic trends and the foreseeable rise
in spending on civil servant pensions make it
necessary to continue the consolidation ef-
forts and initiatives to reduce debt. To effect-
ively contain debt, a constitutional anchoring
of borrowing limits, ultimately aiming at a
balanced budget, is needed, not only for cen-
tral government but also for the state govern-
ments. Such a new provision could be imple-
mented as part of the second phase of the
reform of Germany’s federal structure.

2007. This is a considerable deterioration

62compared with 2006, in which a positive bal-
ance of 371/C252billion was generated. However,
there are some special factors to note. First,
without the substantial one-off revenue
windfalls on account of the advancement of
the deadlines for transferring social contribu-
tions to the funds there would not have been
a surplus in 2006 but rather a deficit of ap-
proximately 33 billion. Second, there would
have been a deficit of around 31 billion in
2007 if the contribution rate had not been in-
creased from 19.5% to 19.9% (+ 34 billion)
and contributions paid by central govern-
ment on behalf of recipients of unemploy-
ment benefit II had not been cut (- 32 billion).
At the end of 2007, the reserves amounted
to312 billion or just over 0.73 of monthly ex-
penditure. Within the space of a year they in-
creased by just over 32 billion.8Revenue fell by just under 2% in total. But
disregarding the special factors referred to, it
would probably have increased by just over
11/C252%. Contribution receipts were curtailed
perceptibly by the fact that pension contribu-
tions paid on behalf of recipients of un-
employment benefit decreased considerably,
as not only were the contributions paid on
behalf of recipients of unemployment benefit
II halved, but also the number of recipients of
unemployment benefit I plummeted.
Total expenditure increased by just under 1%.
The main reason for this was the just over
1/C252% increase in pension payments, particular-
ly owing to the slightly increased number of
pension recipients, but also as a result of the
pension increase on 1 July 2007 (+0.54%). In
addition, there was significant extra spending
on health insurance for pensioners, half of
whose contributions – less the special contri-
bution of 0.9% – are paid from the statutory
pension insurance scheme. In this context the
marked increases in the contribution rates to
the statutory health insurance institutions
pushed up expenditure.
An increase in the surplus and a further
topping-up of the reserves are expected in
2008, as income subject to contributions is
likely to continue to grow faster than pension
expenditure – even if the pension increase
planned for 1 July 2008 is likely to be some-
what higher than in 2007. However, in futureQuarterly

Federal Employment AgencyThe Federal Employment Agency recorded a
surplus of just over 36
1/C252billion in 2007, while
in 2006 income had exceeded expenditure bymore than 311 billion. However, it should be
noted that in 2006 the Federal EmploymentAgency, too, recorded one-off revenue wind-falls owing to the transfer date for contribu-tions being brought forward. Without this ef-fect the 2006 surplus would have totalled ap-proximately 38 billion. Furthermore, the con-
tribution rate was lowered from 6.5% to4.2% at the beginning of 2007 and at thesame time a new Federal grant was intro-duced. Without these measures a surplus ofaround 318 billion would have been recorded
in 2007. This illustrates how much the fi-nances of the Federal Employment Agency –in terms of both revenue and expenditure –benefited from improvements on the labourmarket. Total revenue was down 22
1/C252%o n
the year. Revenue from contributions de-creased by 37% on account of the aforemen-tioned effects (although after adjustmentthere was a noticeable rise).
9However, this
was offset by additional revenue, in theamount of 36
1/C252billion, arising from the new
rule-based Federal grant. This grant corres-ponds to the volume of revenue generatedby 1 percentage point of the standard VATrate.
10Conversely, central government is nolonger obliged to offset any deficit run up by
the Federal Employment Agency.
In 2007 expenditure fell by 18%. This was
largely facilitated by the reduction in un-Quarterly

64employment benefit I payments by 26% on
account of the fall in the number of recipients
to an annual average of just under 1.1 mil-
lion. It probably also owed something to the
shortening of the maximum eligibility periods
for claiming this benefit. Once again substan-
tial savings were also made in spending on
active labour market policy (-91/C252%), although
the savings were much smaller than in 2006.
Considerably lower expenditure was incurred
in the form of the compensatory amount pay-
able to central government, which at 32 bil-
lion was almost 311/C252billion lower than in
2006.
On account of the surpluses recorded in the
past two years, the Federal Employment
Agency’s reserves grew to around 318 billion
at the end of 2007. In 2008, part of the fi-
nancial reserves will be depleted or reallo-
cated. Thus 32.5 billion will be diverted to a
new pension fund for the existing pension
claims of working and retired civil servants of
the Federal Employment Agency. While the
budgets plans envisage a further reduction in
expenditure on unemployment benefit I, this
will be very small, also on account of the ex-
tension of the maximum entitlement period
for unemployment benefit I for older claim-
ants.11Additional expenditure is envisaged
again in respect of vocational training. Fur-
thermore, the compensatory amount payable
to central government is to be replaced by a
reintegration payment which, at 35 billion, is
likely to be more than twice as high as thecurrent outturn. Thus contribution-payers are
being called upon to finance half of the cen-
tral government costs for promotional meas-
ures and of the administration expenses asso-
ciated with long-term unemployment.12
Overall, a deterioration in the Federal Employ-
ment Agency’s finances is therefore expected
on the expenditure side.
Despite being based on the assumption of a
favourable macroeconomic setting, the Fed-
eral Employment Agency’s budget plan envis-
ages an (operating) deficit of 321/C252billion for
2008 after adjustment for the transfer to its
civil servants’ pension fund. A major factor in
the deterioration in its financial situation is
the lowering of the contribution rate from
4.2% to 3.3%. This alone will cause revenue
shortfalls of just over 37 billion. In cutting the
rate, policymakers therefore incurred a con-
siderable risk of having to procyclically raise
the contribution rate again in future down-
turns.
11The Act Reforming the Labour Market reduced the
maximum period of entitlement to unemployment bene-
fit I for new claimants as from February 2006 to
12 months. An extension to 18 months was granted only
to persons aged 55 and over. However, from 2008 un-
employment benefit I will be paid to persons aged 50 and
over for a maximum of 15 months and to persons aged
58 and over for up to 24 months.
12Further easing of the burden on central government
at the expense of the Federal Employment Agency was
planned with the ending of contribution payments for
persons raising children. However, to compensate for the
savings expected to accrue to central government as a re-
sult of extending the maximum period of entitlement to
unemployment benefit I for older persons, central gov-
ernment will continue to pay these contributions in the
amount of just under 3290 million annually.Budgetary
