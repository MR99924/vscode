5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeThe German economy remained on a path of
stagnation in the second quarter of 2003.Seasonally and working-day adjusted realgross domestic product (GDP) was 0.1%down on the winter months, during whichthere had likewise been a slight fall in overalloutput. After adjustment for working-dayvariations, this was 0.2% down on the com-parable period of 2002. The unadjusted fig-ure was -0.6%. On an average of the first sixmonths of 2003, real GDP , in seasonally andworking-day adjusted terms, was 0.3% lowerthan in the second half of 2002 and justfailed to match its level in the first half of2002. Despite a number of positive signals,major leading indicators show that, in earlysummer, the German economy was still hav-ing difficulty in emerging from its cyclicaltrough.
The crucial factor in the further slight decline
in overall output in the second quarter was adeterioration in the external environment. Itis true that imports declined noticeably in sea-sonally adjusted terms, but there was an evensharper decline in exports – this was linked, inparticular, to a perceptible reduction in ex-ports of services. Real net exports showed amarked fall, which was not offset by themoderate rise in domestic demand. Construc-tion investment made a clear recovery, butthis was at least partly influenced by theeffects of catching up on winter productionbacklogs due to the unfavourable weather.In addition, government sharply stepped upGDP

6its consumption spending. Households’ con-
sumption and investment in machinery andequipment failed to generate any stimuli,however.
IndustryThe situation in industry had perceptibly de-
teriorated in the spring quarter but stabilisedin early summer. Seasonally adjusted outputrose very sharply in July. Not only did it showa month-on-month rise, it was also nearly2
1/C252% up on the average figure for the second
quarter. Even so, this is not so much a sign ofa cyclical recovery, but rather the result of theholidays having a comparatively minor impactthis year. The summer school holiday periodwas concentrated on August, which is likelyto have had a matching dampening impacton output activity. Seasonal adjustment can
only take into account the average medium-term impact of the holidays. An additionalspecial factor in July was that production inthe car industry was stepped up sharply inorder to make up for the strike-inducedshortfalls in June.
How cautiously the increased level of output
in July should be interpreted in cyclical termsis also revealed by the moderate developmentof new orders. In seasonally adjusted terms,incoming orders were no higher than in Juneand remained around
1/C252% down on the year.
This was just over1/C252% up on the average of
the second quarter, but this was due, notleast, to the previously very low level of de-mand. That applies just as much to domesticbusiness as to export business.
ConstructionThe timing of the holidays also contributed to
a high level of output in the construction sec-tor in July. In seasonally adjusted terms, it wasperceptibly up on the second quarter (whichhad already brought significantly increasedbusiness activity after the end of the winterhold-ups) and almost matched the figure forthe same period of 2002.
The underlying downward trend in demand
for construction work continued up to theend of the period under review, revealingclearly that, so far, there have been no signsof cyclical improvement in construction activ-ity. Although seasonally adjusted new con-struction orders were higher in June (morerecent data are unavailable at present) thanOverall economic growth

7they had been in May, they failed to match
the level of the preceding period. At 11%,the year-on-year decline remained very large.
Labour marketThe labour market situation remained un-
favourable up to the end of the period underreview. According to an initial estimate by theFederal Statistical Office, the number of per-sons in work in June showed a further declineto a seasonally adjusted 38.08 million. How-ever, the month-on-month reduction fell toaround 15,000 persons, whereas, in the firstfew months of this year, it had been morethan 60,000. The late start to the holidaysand the large-scale promotion of self-employ-ment by labour market policy both playeda part in this. The year-on-year rate, whichhad been as much as -1.7% in early spring,went down slightly to -1.6%. This corres-ponds to a decrease of around 620,000 per-sons in work at the end of the period underreview, compared with 670,000 in April.
Despite the persistent reduction in the num-
ber of jobs, over the past few months therehas been scarcely any change in the seasonal-ly adjusted number of persons who are offi-cially registered as unemployed. In August,the figure was 4.41 million. This was some-what more than 295,000 above the previousyear’s level. The seasonally adjusted un-employment rate, as calculated by the FederalLabour Office, remained at 10.6%. Using theinternationally standardised method, the fig-ure was 9.4%.Economic conditions in Germany*

Unemployment

BUNDESBANK
Monthly Report
September 2003
8For some time now, the rise in unemployment
due to unfavourable economic conditions –as reflected, for example, by the continuinglarge inflows of persons previously in employ-ment – has been offset mathematically by thelabour exchanges’ ongoing efforts to “up-date” applicant levels in connection with therestructuring of labour market policy. In Au-gust, this became especially obvious in east-ern Germany, where the seasonally adjustednumber of persons officially registered as un-employed fell somewhat, even though therehad been further significant cuts in traditionallabour market assistance provided by job cre-ation and vocational training measures.
PricesFollowing a period of very calm develop-
ments, prices accelerated again at the end ofthe period under review. In seasonally adjust-ed terms, the level of consumer prices in Au-gust went up by 0.3% on the month. Theyear-on-year rate of increase, which hadgone down below 1% for a time, went up to1.1%. Measured by the harmonised priceindex, the figure was likewise 1.1%, com-pared with 0.8% in July. The accelerated ratewas due mainly to higher prices for refinedpetroleum products. The persistently highprices for crude oil on the world market andthe euro’s depreciation against the US dollarboth had an impact in this respect. Added tothis was a sharp rise in the cost of packageholidays, which was connected with the con-centration of school holidays in August. Bycontrast, there were hardly any drought-related price increases in the case of food.Industrial goods became slightly cheaper, as is
usual at this time of year.
The high oil prices and the exchange rate
movements were the main reasons for a fur-ther slight seasonally adjusted rise in importprices calculated on a euro basis. The year-on-year decline, which had been somewhatover 3% in the second quarter, went down to2.0%. Excluding energy, import prices weredeclining up to the end of the period underreview. The level was 2.4% down on theyear. The development in industrial producerprices, which had shown a seasonally adjust-ed rise and an increase in the year-on-yearrate to 1.9% in July, was likewise due to en-ergy prices.
Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
Indebtedness of central, state and local gov-
ernment rose very steeply in July (+ 314.8 bil-
lion). In the first six months of 2003 net bor-rowing totalled 347.3 billion (compared with
327.1 billion in the first six months of 2002).
Of this sharp growth in debt in July, just overhalf was attributable to short-term cash ad-vances and money market loans which aresubject to strong fluctuations during the year.The largest borrower was central governmentwhich raised a net total of 310.5 billion.
Money market loans made up 34.6 billion of
this figure. The increase in central govern-ment’s capital market debt (+ 35.8 billion) was
attributable mainly to the sale of two-year

9Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) which yield-
ed34.9 billion. The topping-up of a June
issue accounted for 34.4 billion of this
amount and market management operationsfor30.5 billion. No redemptions were made.
The outstanding amount of five-year Federalnotes (Bobls) rose to a lesser extent (+ 30.7
billion). It is interesting to note that the out-standing amount of loans against borrowers’notes increased by 33.3 billion since over the
past few years this financing instrument hasplayed only a very small role for central gov-ernment. In the case of Federal bonds(Bunds), there was the new issue of a ten-year Bund with a 3.75% coupon and an allot-ment volume of 35.6 billion (excluding 30.4
billion for the German Unity Fund) and thetopping-up of a 30-year Bund launched inJanuary 2003 which raised 33.5 billion. This
was offset by the repayment of a TreuhandAgency bond ( 35.1 billion) and a Bund ( 38.2
billion). Taking into account market manage-ment operations, the outstanding amount ofBunds declined by 31.8 billion on balance.
Debt securities of the Currency ConversionEqualisation Fund amounting to 31.1 billion
were redeemed on schedule. In the case ofthose special funds not integrated into cen-tral government debt, the German UnityFund’s debt level rose by 30.3 billion.
State government net borrowing was still
fairly high in July ( 33.7 billion) and was
around the average level in the earlier monthsof this year. The net volume of Treasury notesissued by state government reached 31.3 bil-
lion, 30.8 billion of which was raised by the
state of Hesse alone. Short-term cash ad-vances increased by 33.2 billion, whereas theoutstanding amount of loans against borrow-
ers’ notes went down by 30.9 billion. Local
government appears to have again marginallyraised its indebtedness in July.
Central government borrowingIn August central government drew 315.1 bil-
lion gross on the capital markets, 311.9 billion
of which was required to refinance maturingsecurities. The volume of outstanding moneymarket loans remained virtually unchanged(+30.2 billion). On the whole, central govern-
ment debt consequently went up by 33.4 bil-
lion. The most significant single item of grossborrowing was the topping-up of the Bund is-sued at the beginning of July. 36.6 billion was
allocated, 30.1 billion of which was trans-
ferred to the German Unity Fund. In this case,Net borrowing in the market

10the average yield was 26 basis points above
the value reached in July. Including marketmanagement operations, the outstandingamount of Bunds rose by 36.8 billion. 35.6
billion was raised through the issue of Treas-ury discount paper (Bubills); in July themonthly issuance had been increased by 31
billion to 36 billion and, for the first time, a
provision was set aside for market manage-ment operations. In doing so, the averageyield (2.05%) rose above the value of the pre-ceding month for the first time in a longwhile. After deducting redemptions, 30.6 bil-
lion was raised. The outstanding amount ofSch/C228tze increased by 30.6 billion, whereas
Bobls decreased by 36.0 billion. Federal sav-
ings notes, new sales of which are only ofminor significance, were redeemed to theamount of 30.1 billion net. Loans against bor-
rowers’ notes went up by 31.3 billion.
Securities markets
Bond marketIn July domestic borrowers issued bonds in
the German market to a market value of3104.6 billion, ie far more than in the previ-
ous month ( 388.5 billion). At 316.1 billion,
net sales were actually four times up on theJune figure of 34.0 billion. By contrast, the
volume of foreign debt securities outstandingshrank by 31.5 billion. Overall, net sales of
domestic and foreign bonds yielded 314.6 bil-
lion in July, compared with 39.4 billion one
month previously.
In July credit institutions issued 311.3 billion
worth of their own debt securities, after hav-ing redeemed 30.2 billion worth of paper in
the previous month. A particular contributoryfactor was net sales of other bank bondsamounting to 39.3 billion. Whereas 35.0 bil-
lion was raised from sales of debt securities is-sued by specialised credit institutions and31.0 billion from sales of mortgage Pfand-
briefe, net redemptions of public Pfandbriefeamounted to 34.0 billion.
On balance, the public sector borrowed 34.5
billion in the German bond market in July.The Federal Government raised 38.9 billion
net from the sale of debt securities. Most ofthese were two-year Federal Treasury notesand 30-year Federal bonds, net sales of whichamounted to 35.5 billion and 33.7 billion re-Net borrowing in the market by central

11spectively. In July the Land governments is-
sued 31.6 billion more debt securities. Paper
issued by the former Treuhandanstalt and theCurrency Conversion Equalisation Fund wasredeemed for 35.1 billion and 31.1 billion re-
spectively. Neither borrower now issues paperon the bond market; they both acquire refi-nancing in conjunction with the Federal Gov-ernment.
Net sales of corporate bonds amounted to
30.2 billion in July, following a 30.9 billion de-
crease in the volume of such paper outstand-ing in June.
Debt securities were purchased primarily by
domestic non-banks ( 37.9 billion) and credit
institutions ( 36.0 billion), whereas foreign in-
vestors made only a slight addition to theirholdings of domestic bonds and notes ( 30.7
billion). Domestic non-banks invested mainlyin public sector bonds ( 35.2 billion) and
added 31.7 billion worth of foreign debt se-
curities to their portfolio. Credit institutionsmainly purchased their own paper ( 37.6 bil-
lion) while raising 33.1 billion net from the
sale of foreign bonds and notes.
Equity marketAt33.1 billion, sales in the German equity
market in July were well down on the previ-ous month ( 311.3 billion). This is due to the
fact that far fewer foreign equities ( 32.4 bil-
lion) were sold than in June ( 310.6 billion). As
in the previous month, domestic enterprisesplaced new shares to a market value of 30.7
billion. Shares issued by German enterpriseswere purchased primarily by domestic non-banks, which added 30.6 billion net to their
holdings of such shares. Meanwhile, domes-tic credit institutions sold, on balance, 30.6
billion of German equities. Foreign investorsadded 30.7 billion net to their holdings of do-
mestic equities.
Mutual fund sharesDomestic mutual funds raised 31.4 billion in
July, far less than in the previous month ( 34.3
billion). Most of these resources were invest-ed in funds open to the general public ( 31.1
billion). As in the previous months, open-endreal estate funds raised the bulk of the re-sources ( 31.4 billion). Mixed funds and bond-
based funds each sold 30.2 billion worth of

ively). Specialised funds sold 30.2 billion
worth of shares. In July 30.1 billion net of for-
eign fund shares were sold.
Credit institutions and domestic non-banks

lion.
Balance of payments
In July Germany’s current account ran a sur-
plus of 31.1 billion, which was down on the
previous month. A significantly improvedtrading result was offset by a sharp increasein the deficit on invisible current transactions,which is that part of the current accountcomprising services, factor income and cur-rent transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in July there was amonth-on-month increase of 33.8 billion in
the trade surplus to 314.1 billion. After the
elimination of seasonal factors, this amount-ed to an increase of 32
1/C252billion to 3121/C252bil-
lion. The reason was a sharp increase in ex-ports coupled with a significant decline in im-ports. In July exports increased by almost 3%while imports fell by more than 2% in com-parison with the June levels. The movementpertained almost exclusively to volumes asthe external trade prices in July remainedpractically unchanged from the previous
month.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents increased to 312.4 billion
in July compared with 37.4 billion in June.
This was due primarily to the significant netincrease in payments of factor income tonon-residents, which amounted to 35.5 bil-
lion in July. The main reason for this wasinterest payments on securities, which aregenerally relatively high in July, as well as divi-dend and interest payments in the field ofdirect investment. In addition, there was amonth-on-month increase in the deficit onservices to 34.1 billion. Net expenditure on
current transactions remained virtually un-changed ( 32.9 billion).
With low overall turnover, the statistically re-
corded portfolio transactions were almost inbalance in the month under review (– 30.2 bil-
lion) whereas in June there had been net out-flows of funds ( 34.3 billion). German invest-
ors acquired 31.3 billion worth of foreign se-
curities in July, approximately 314 billion less
than in June. There were shifts away frombonds and notes ( 32.8 billion) to shares ( 32.7
billion). In addition, German savers were pur-chasing money market paper ( 31.4 billion)
and, to a lesser extent, investment fund cer-tificates ( 30.1 billion). Foreign investors also
reduced their new investments in Germany,from 310.7 billion in June to 31.1 billion in
July. The greatest demand among foreign in-vestors was for German bonds ( 33.6 billion)
and shares ( 31.0 billion) whereas there were

13and investment fund certificates ( 30.6 bil-
lion).
In the field of direct investment net funds
amounting to 32.2 billion flowed abroad in
July whereas in the previous few months in-flows had predominated. German proprietorsprovided their subsidiaries abroad with 35.1
billion net, mostly in the form of loans ( 34.3
billion). In the other direction, foreign enter-prises increased their investment in Germanyby32.9 billion. Intra-group credits played a
decisive role here, too ( 32.7 billion).
There were contrasting developments in the
non-securitised credit transactions of non-banks in July. While there were small inflowsof foreign funds to the general governmentsector ( 30.4 billion), in the case of enterprises
and individuals, capital exports predominated(34.4 billion). The credit transactions of the
entire banking system, which reflect, as itwere, all other statistically recorded externaltransactions, resulted in net capital imports of36.5 billion in the month under review. In the
external operations of the credit institutions,funds accrued in the amount of 323.1 billion
net. By contrast, the Bundesbank’s externaltransactions that are classified as credit trans-actions led to a strengthening of its foreignasset position ( 316.6 billion).

15The performance
of German credit
institutions in 2002The German banking industry was still
under-performing in financial year2002. The operating result and theprofit for the financial year were bothdown again on the year. In operatingbusiness, the distinct increase in netinterest received and perceptible sav-ings made on administrative costsmore than offset the decline in netincome from commission business andproprietary trading. However, the costof value adjustments and risk provi-sioning went up by more than one-third, which ultimately led to the oper-ating result being half that of the pre-vious year. In relation to the balancesheet total, it thus plunged to the low-est level for ten years. In 2002 therewas also a further marked decrease inthe profit for the financial year aftertax. According to the interim reportsand the partial information availableat present, the situation with regard toGerman banks’ performance will notease until financial year 2003.
Overview
The tense situation with regard to the banks’
performance reflects, on the one hand, cyclic-al factors and, on the other, the effects ofstructural problems within the banking sector,these having been made worse by the factthat the German economy has experiencedseveral years of stagnation. Sliding equityprices put downward pressure on incomefrom commission business and proprietary

16trading. At the same time, unsatisfactory eco-
nomic developments led to increased riskprovisioning. However, a marked increase innet interest received, due to a sharp increasein low-yield sight deposits, offset this tosome extent in financial year 2002. Moreover,the banks’ restructuring measures, some ofwhich are extensive and take the form ofsharp cuts in administrative expenditure,began to bear fruit.Despite the sharp increase in net interest re-
ceived ( 35.6 billion), the interest margin of
1.20% was, in an environment of low inter-est rates, still well below the average of thepast ten years (1.48%). At the same time,there was a 31.1 billion decrease in net in-
come from commission business. Togetherwith the marked increase in gross earnings,savings of 33.0 billion in administrative costs
boosted the partial operating result by 37.5
billion, taking it to 331.6 billion. By contrast,
net income from proprietary trading was stillon the decline. Net other operating incomestagnated. On balance, the German banksreduced their cost/income ratio by just under4 percentage points compared with the previ-ous year, taking it down to just over 67%. Itwas, however, still well up on the average ofthe past ten years (just over 64
1/C252%).
Not least because of the difficult economic
environment, there was a further marked in-crease in risk provisions for loan and securitiesbusiness in the year under review. Risk provi-sioning thus represents the key negative fac-tor affecting performance. In 2002 net valu-ation expenditure ( 331.5 billion) was almost
60% up on the already high figure for 2001.It therefore had a distinct negative impact onthe operating result after the valuation ofloans and securities; at 36.8 billion, this was
far lower than in 2001 ( 313.4 billion), despite
the improvement in the partial operating re-sult.
The banks drew on the “extraordinary ac-
counts” to bolster their results somewhat.However, the sharp year-on-year increase innet receipts ( 33.9 billion in 2002 as againstDM

1731.1 billion in 2001) went only some way to-
wards offsetting the marked decline in theoperating result. Accordingly, the net profitfor the financial year before tax went downfrom 314.5 billion in 2001 to only 310.6 bil-
lion in the year under review. The net profitafter tax for 2002 was 36.8 billion, compared
with 310.7 billion in the previous year. The
banks channelled 32.1 billion of these funds
to reserves, taking the net balance sheetprofit to 34.7 billion, which was thus even
below the poor figure for the previous year(37.0 billion).
The continued unfavourable performance
nonetheless seems to indicate that Germanbanking was beginning to emerge from thedoldrums in 2002. In particular, following thestringent balance sheet adjustments, valu-ation expenditure is likely to decrease percep-
tibly in the current year. However, the stockmarket recovery will also have a positive ef-fect. The continuing heavy demand on thepart of private non-banks for sight depositswill tend to reduce interest expenditure,while, viewed in terms of income, the (insome cases) drastic reduction in risk assets iscertainly likely to put pressure on net interestreceived. On the whole, these developmentsare therefore quite consistent with the cau-tious view that the outlook for performanceis gradually improving, which is also the im-pression conveyed by the information re-ceived to date from the German banking in-dustry.Performance of the various categories of banks in 2001/2002p

18Net interest received
Interest business provided the main positive
contribution to German banks’ performancein financial year 2002. Following an increasein the previous year to 380.0 billion, net inter-
est received swelled by 7.0% to 385.6 billion
in 2002. A further factor was the exceptional-ly sharp decline in interest expenditure (by352.2 billion to 3258.9 billion), which was
even larger than the similarly marked declinein interest received (by 346.6 billion to
3344.4 billion). In relation to total profits
from the German banks’ operating business,net interest received thus contributed 73.4%in the year under review, as opposed to69.9% in 2001. The interest margin, definedas the ratio of net interest received to the do-mestic credit institutions’ balance sheet total,thus widened again for the first time sincethe early 1990s – from 1.13% in 2001 to1.20% in the year under review.
The increase is even more obvious if net inter-
est received is related to the balance sheettotal after adjustment for interbank business.In 2002 interbank business, which generallyhas no effect on net interest received, in-creased far more sharply than the banks’average volume of business for the year,which was only 0.2% up on the 2001 figure.Calculated in this manner, the “adjusted”interest margin went up to 1.64% in 2002from 1.53% in the previous year.
Of the various categories of banks, commer-
cial banks, in particular, distinctly widenedtheir interest margin in financial year 2002.The lead in this respect was taken by the bigInterest received by credit

19banks; with net interest received amounting
to317.6 billion, they increased their interest
margin by 0.21 percentage point to 1.1%.Key factors were, however, the perceptibledecline in the balance sheet total of this cat-egory of banks and the marked increase in re-ceipts from their participating interests, thesebeing included in net interest received. Theshare of net interest received in total profitsfrom operating business thus went up at thebig banks from 50
1/C252% in 2001 to 63% in
2002. Given their traditionally different busi-ness structure, net interest received played afar more important role at savings banks andcredit cooperatives, representing a share inthe operating result of 81% and 79% re-spectively. Moreover, the interest margin wasfar higher at these categories of banks(2.38% and 2.49% respectively), althoughthe increase was comparatively only slight (by
0.10 and 0.08 percentage point respectively).Of the categories of institutions which, owingto their concentration on interbank andwholesale business, generally have a narrow-er interest margin, the Land banks achieved
at least a moderate increase in net interest re-ceived and, given weak growth in the balancesheet total, a slight increase in the interestmargin. By contrast, at the regional institu-tions of cooperative banks, net interest re-ceived in 2002 was again down on the year.However, owing to an even more marked de-cline in the balance sheet total, this categoryof banks recorded, on balance, an increase intheir interest margin.As a percentage of the average balance sheet total  1

20Net commissions received
After the previous year’s fairly poor result, the
German banks recorded a further decline incommission business in financial year 2002.As income from commission business shrankfurther, net commissions received by domes-tic credit institutions fell in 2002 by 31.1 bil-
lion (-4.1%) to 324.3 billion.
Besides the low volume of sales on the Ger-
man equity markets (at 32.6 trillion, down
20% on the year in 2002), persistently weakissuing activity by domestic enterprises wasresponsible for the decrease in net commis-sions received. Only 21 enterprises went pub-lic in 2001 and in 2002 the number dwindledto six, the latter raising a total of only 30.2
billion in capital. Bank customers also showedless interest in mutual fund shares in 2002;
purchases of mutual fund shares by domesticnon-banks, for example, declined in thatperiod by 320.7 billion to 364.4 billion. Al-
though there was at the same time a markedincrease in the volume of German bond trad-ing, this consisted mainly of transactionswithin the banking sector, which had no im-pact on net commissions received by thebanking industry as a whole.
The other components of commissions re-
ceived also tended to contribute, on balance,to fairly sluggish growth. Receipts from assetmanagement and guarantee business wereboth down on the year. By contrast, growthin commissions from payment transactionshad a stabilising effect. Moreover, there wasalso an increase in receipts from the inter-mediation of third parties’ financial products,such as insurance policies.
The commercial banks were almost the only
credit institutions to be affected by therenewed decline in net commissions received,although they again accounted for more thanhalf the net commissions received in 2002.On balance, net commissions received by thiscategory of banks fell by 31.3 billion to 313.9
billion. By contrast, the increase in net com-missions received in the savings bank sectorand by the cooperative banks was somewhatstronger than the overall figure. However, interms of the operating result, this line of busi-ness is far less important for these institutionsthan for the commercial banks. The 2002 re-sult was 34.8 billion and 33.1 billion respect-
ively, corresponding to roughly 16.7% and%

Net profit or net loss on financial
operations
Apart from net commissions received, weak
international stock market growth had anegative impact on proprietary trading byGerman banks. At 33.0 billion, the net profit
from financial business was not only 45%down on the year, it was also the poorest re-sult for five years. This decline affected bigbanks almost exclusively. Whereas, at 32.1
billion, their income from proprietary tradingwas 57.5% down on the previous year, bothLand banks and regional institutions of co-
operative banks recorded higher receiptsfrom proprietary trading than in the previous
year. At the Land banks, in particular, this was
also due to higher receipts from foreign ex-change transactions than in 2001. The bigbanks’ share in the proprietary trading figuresfor the sector as a whole consequently wentdown from 91% in 2001 to 70% in the yearunder review.
Administrative expenditure
Overall, the German banks cut their adminis-
trative costs in 2002 by 33.0 billion to 378.3
billion; in relation to the balance sheettotal, this was equivalent to a reduction from1.15% in 2001 to 1.10% in the year underreview. Evidently, the cost-cutting pro-grammes, some of which had already beenRelative significance of major income and cost items for individual categories of

22initiated in earlier years, were having a dis-
tinct impact in the period under review.Major efforts in this respect were made bythe big banks in particular; in 2002 their ad-ministrative costs shrank by 32.7 billion or
11.2%. The regional institutions of credit co-operatives achieved similarly high percentagesavings. By contrast, administrative spendingat the public sector banks and the coopera-tive banks remained virtually unchanged in
relation to the balance sheet total.
Reductions in administrative expenditure made
similar inroads into staff costs ( 31.6 billion or
3.7%) and other administrative spending(31.4 billion or 3.7%). The decrease in staff
costs essentially reflected the shedding of alarge number of jobs in the banking sector(18,300 jobs or 2.5% of the workforce). Onbalance, the number of those employed inthe banking industry in 2002 fell below the1992 level. In 2002 nearly 12,000 jobs werecut in the private banking sector alone; staff-ing reductions in this category of banks weretherefore more than three times up on theyear. However, the savings banks also uppedthe pace of redundancies, slashing 4,000 jobsand thus making an even greater contributionto reducing the number of jobs in the bank-ing sector than in 2001.
Alongside further consolidation of the branch
network, cost-cutting in the field of IT wasalso evidently a factor in the marked reduc-tion in “other administrative spending”. Thebig banks, in particular, achieved savings of31.2 billion or 9.8%. In addition, the regional
institutions of credit cooperatives made per-ceptible reductions in other administrativespending, although consolidation with regardto the number of institutions and theirbranches was very much in evidence at sav-ings banks and credit cooperatives, too.
All in all, there was a continuation of the pro-
cess of consolidation in the banking sector,which has now been under way for someyears; the number of institutions was reduced%

The num-ber of credit cooperatives went down from1,621 at the end of 2001 to 1,490 by theend of 2002, while the number of branchesof this category of banks decreased from14,584 to 13,889. However, the savingsbanks also made a particular contribution tothe consolidation of the branch network. Atthe end of 2002, there were 1,020 fewerbranches of savings banks, leaving a total of15,628. In the private banking sector, how-ever, the pace of branch network rationalisa-tion was slower than in 2001.Net other operating income or charges
At33.7 billion, net other operating income or
charges in financial year 2002 remainedstable at the same high level as in 2001. Theslight deterioration in other operating incomeor charges in the narrower sense was mainlyoffset by a slight decrease in other taxes (un-related to income and earnings). Of the vari-ous categories of banks, regional banks andother commercial banks benefited from a dis-tinct increase of 30.7 billion in net other oper-
ating income and charges, which took it to31.7 billion, whereas the big banks, in par-
ticular, recorded a slight decrease.Structural data on German credit institutions

assets and the cost/income ratio
At338.3 billion, the operating result before
the valuation of assets, which is made up ofthe partial operating result, the net profit ornet loss on financial operations and net otheroperating income or charges, increased by15% overall to 338.3 billion in 2002 com-
pared with the poor result for 2001. In rela-tion to the average volume of business aswell, the operating result before the valuationof assets increased markedly for nearly all cat-egories of banks (see above table). Land
banks were the sole exception, showing onlya slight increase. Unlike the other categoriesof banks, however, they had not recorded adecrease in 2001.The general increase in the operating result
before the valuation of assets was also re-flected in the overall decline in the cost/income ratio; relative to gross earnings, it de-creased across all categories of banks fromjust over 77% in 2001 to slightly more than71% in 2002. If the net profit or net loss onfinancial operations and net operating in-come or charges are also taken into account,it declined from 71% in 2001 to just over67% in 2002 (see table on page 25). Loweradministrative spending and higher net inter-est received outweighed the slight decline innet commissions received and the net profitor net loss on financial operations respectively(for the partial operating result, see table onpage 17). This brought to an end the continu-ing upward trend in the cost/income ratioover the past few years. Nonetheless, thereOperating result before net income or net charges from the valuation of assets*

25was quite considerable variation in these
developments at the level of the individualcategories of banks. The regional institutionsof credit cooperatives and the commercialbanks, in particular, recorded a far smallercost/income ratio, admittedly following anabove-average increase in the previous year.
Net income or net charges from the
valuation of assets
The German banks again expanded their risk
provisions considerably in the year under re-view. This had a considerable adverse effecton overall performance (see chart on page 26).In 2002 there was an extremely large increasein net valuation expenditure at some individ-ual banks. The overall figure was 331.5 bil-
lion, which is equivalent to an increase of311.7 billion or 59
1/C252% on 2001. Net valu-
ation expenditure also rose distinctly in rela-tion to the average balance sheet total,reaching 0.44% in 2002 compared with0.24% in 2000 and 0.28% in 2001. Depend-ing on the business structure of the individualcategories of banks, this share varied consid-erably (from 0.71% at savings banks to0.20% at mortgage banks). On balance, after31.0 billion in 2001, 32.0 billion was added
to the fund for general banking risks in 2002.However, in the performance analysis pre-sented here, this amount is allocated to thedisposition of profit (accumulation of re-serves) and is not reflected in a lower net an-nual profit.

minor value adjustments and release of provi-sions rose only slightly from 32.7 billion in
2001 to 33.0 billion in 2002.
1Again in 2002
most of the net valuation expenditure wasprobably related to domestic banking busi-ness. In 2002 the German banks again had toset aside very extensive risk provisions tocover sizeable increases in the number of cor-porate insolvencies among their domesticcustomers, including some major enterprises.Following sharp increases in 2001, there wasagain a large rise in the number of companyinsolvencies in the year under review –37,579 after 32,278 in 2001.
2However, the
comparatively small share of loans to house-holds means that the similarly marked in-crease in consumer insolvencies is likely tohave played only a minor role in the overall in-crease in risk provisions. In addition to the in-
solvencies and accounting scandals at somemajor enterprises, the risks related to “com-bating terrorism” in the wake of 11 Septem-ber 2001 probably also had an impact on thevaluation expenditure for foreign loans. Bythe end of 2002, in particular, there was amarked increase in uncertainties with regardto the Iraq conflict. Although German banksreduced their foreign investment in specificcountries considerably, they simultaneouslyhad to expand their risk provisions for someof these countries. By contrast, at 30.9 billion,
the write-downs on fixed interest securities,which were partly covered by the net incomeor net charges from the valuation of assets,were well down on 2001 ( 33.3 billion); this
was due, not least, to the favourable interestrate environment.
All in all, in 2002 the increase in net income
or net charges from the valuation of assetswas again particularly large in those categor-ies of banks which are more heavily involvedin wholesale and international business.However, unlike in the previous year, thebanks which focus on retail business, such assavings banks and credit cooperatives, had tocope with major increases in their risk provi-sions. In line with this, net income or netcharges from the valuation of assets reducedDM

338.3 billion before valuation to only 36.8 bil-
lion after valuation. Compared with the previ-ous year, this corresponds to a decrease of36.6 billion – or just over 49% – in the oper-
ating result after valuation. The Land banks
recorded a negative figure of - 32.3 billion;
the figure for the regional institutions ofcredit cooperatives was 3119 million, while
the big banks were still just in the black with358 million. Savings banks and credit co-
operatives also showed clear decreases over-all, while regional and other commercialbanks improved their operating result percep-tibly.
Net other and extraordinary income
or charges
Net other and extraordinary income or
charges rose sharply in 2002 compared withthe previous year; from 31.1 billion in 2001,
they increased three and a half times in theyear under review to 33.9 billion. The Land
banks, in particular, drew on 33.4 billion from
the “extraordinary accounts” (as opposed to-30.4 billion in 2001) to bolster their overall
result. However, the mortgage banks, savingsbanks and credit cooperatives also increasedthe contribution of the extraordinary ac-counts to the result. By contrast, the extraor-dinary accounts pushed the big banks’ resultdown by a further 32.0 billion, after boosting
it by 32.1 billion in 2001, while the regional
and other commercial banks reduced theirnegative balance from - 31.2 billion (2001) to
-30.5 billion in the year under review.A very sharp 34.7 billion increase in the result
of the banks’ financial investment business,taking it from 33.9 billion in 2001 to 38.6 bil-
lion in the year under review, contributedto the high balance across all categories ofbanks. There was a sharp increase in receiptsfrom value adjustments in respect of partici-pating interests, shares in affiliated enter-prises and securities treated as fixed assets.

The Land banks and the mortgage banks, in
particular, generated on balance considerablegrowth of their “extraordinary accounts”.Most of the big banks also used this to bolstertheir result; beyond this category of banks,the sharp increase in expenditure by one insti-tution in this area meant that the net contri-bution was nevertheless lower than in theprevious year.
In addition, there was a considerably higher
positive contribution from net extraordinaryincome and charges in the narrower sense(31.4 billion in the year under review com-
pared with 30.2 billion in 2001). The (in some
cases considerable) increases in this item atLand banks, credit cooperatives and their re-
gional institutions and mortgage banks con-tributed to this figure, while in the case ofcommercial banks and savings banks thisitem reduced the result. The net increases inincome and earnings, which were marked forsome categories of banks, more than offsetthe increasing negative impact of loss trans-fers and profit transfers and the decrease in

28income from the release of special reserves
within the “extraordinary accounts”. Specific-ally, loss transfers amounting to 33.8 billion in
2002 had a greater overall impact than in theprevious year ( 32.4 billion). Derived profits
also increased perceptibly from 31.8 billion in
2001 to 33.2 billion in 2002; 30.7 billion of
this amount accrued to institutions majority-held by foreign banks. At the same time, netincome from the release of special reserves,

Despite the sharp increase in the result from
the “extraordinary accounts”, this nowherenear offset the considerable decrease in theoperating result. The banks’ net profit for theyear before tax was correspondingly low:from 314.5 billion in 2001 it shrank by nearly
27% to 310.6 billion in 2002. However, the
picture varies widely across the various cat-egories of banks. The slump at the big bankswas the primary factor contributing to themarked downturn; these banks recorded a31.9 billion deficit in 2002, which contrastedBreakdown of other and extraordinary income or charges

29with a positive balance of 33.0 billion in the
previous year. The Land banks also recorded
decreases which took their profit for the yearbefore tax down from 31.8 billion in 2001 to
31.1 billion in the year under review. By con-
trast, running against the general trend, theregional and other commercial banks, in par-ticular, recorded a marked increase from 31.2
billion in 2001 to 32.8 billion in 2002. How-
ever, the credit cooperatives, too, reported aclear improvement in their pre-tax profits,which were up from 31.9 billion in 2001 to
32.4 billion in the year under review, while
pre-tax profits at the savings banks, at 33.4
billion, were somewhat down on the previousyear ( 33.6 billion).
All in all, however, the banks again recorded
sharp decreases. Return on equity before taxwas also correspondingly weaker; followingthe marked deterioration in 2001, there wasa further perceptible decline from an averageof 6.39% to 4.38% in the year under review.At the same time, the differences betweenthe various categories of banks became farwider (see table on page 30).
Taxes on income and earnings made a first
slight recovery in 2002, rising by just under4% to 33.9 billion, after having hit a low in
2001 that had not been seen for many years.The tax ratio reached 37% and was thusroughly at the level of 2000, well above thelow 2001 level of only 26%. The big banks,in particular, which had recorded a total of30.4 billion in tax revenue, again had an – ad-
mittedly small – amount of tax expenses(30.1 billion) in 2002. For the Land banks,
too, tax expenses were, at 30.4 billion, one-third up on the 2001 figure. Apart from a
slight increase at the credit cooperatives,however, tax expenses showed a further, insome cases sharp, decline at the other cat-egories of banks. In addition to the decreasein earnings and tax-exempt proceeds fromsales, key factors contributing to the overalllow figure for tax expenses were the ongoingreduction in provisions for taxation (includingliabilities-side deferred taxes in connectionwith the amended tax legislation of the pastfew years) and the expansion of asset-sidedeferred taxes.

30All in all, this led to a further reduction in the
profit for the financial year after tax. In 2002it was 36.8 billion, 37% down on the previ-
ous year’s profit of 310.7 billion. The prime
contributors to this slump were the bigbanks, whose annual profit after tax wentdown from 33.4 billion to - 32.0 billion, ie
well in the red,
6and the Land banks, which,
with a profit for the year of 30.7 billion,
achieved less than half the 2001 result ( 31.5
billion). Overall, apart from the clearly lowerprofit for the financial year after tax of 36.8
billion, the balance sheet profit also showed,as in the previous year, substantial losses of31.7 billion being carried forward. Net trans-
fers of 32.0 billion to the fund for general
banking risks, as opposed to 31.0 billion in
2001, put further negative pressure onprofits. By contrast, the banks stabilised theirbalance sheet profit by drawing extensively
on the provisions and participation rights cap-ital to a total of 35.5 billion – a sum well in
excess of the amounts transferred to the pro-visions or used to top up the participationrights capital ( 33.9 billion).
7Overall, the out-
come for 2002 was a far weaker balancesheet profit of 34.7 billion, following 38.6 bil-

ably higher annual deficit at one specific big bank. The
other big banks offset this deficit to some extent.

31Outlook
With regard to interest paid, in the current fi-
nancial year the banks are likely to benefitfrom the sustained growth of low-yield over-night deposits. At the end of the first half-year, non-banks’ overnight deposits were justunder 13
1/C252% up on their 2001 level. Their
share in the aggregate balance sheet totalwas thus 10%, slightly up from 9
1/C252% at the
end of 2002. The banks are also likely tobenefit from the renewed increase in the ap-peal of short-term savings deposits. With re-gard to their lending business, aligning theterms more closely with credit risk can be ex-pected to have a positive effect on interest re-ceived. Finally, however, in addition to the flatyield curve in the second half of 2002 and thefirst half of 2003, the hiving-off of risk assets– which, in some cases, is marked – will havea negative impact on interest received. Over-all, therefore, net interest received may gen-erally be expected to decrease.
By contrast, in commissions business, the do-
mestic banks’ profit from income and earn-ings is likely to improve slightly in 2003. Al-though there were no new equity issues inthe German stock markets, the distinct shareprice gains in the equity markets, in particu-lar, as well as the fact that there has been atleast a slight recovery in the volume of issuesin the other sectors, should lead to an in-
crease in net commissions received. In termsof net income from proprietary trading, therecovery is also likely to have a positive effectin the stock markets.
With regard to administrative costs, the full
effect of the cost-cutting programmes wasprobably not yet felt in 2002. Further distinctsavings can be expected here in the course of2003.
The fact that the increase in the number of
company insolvencies slowed in the first halfof 2003 might be the first sign that the eco-nomic situation is stabilising at a low level.Against the backdrop of the extensive valueadjustments already carried out in 2001, thisis also likely to have a positive impact on thedevelopment of the banks’ valuation expend-iture for the current year. Given the globaleconomic situation, there will probably beless need for greater risk provisioning in 2003than in 2002. Moreover, the partial reductionin risk assets will have an additional alleviat-ing effect on the expected valuation expend-iture but may also slow the growth of interestreceived. In sum, the German credit institu-tions are likely to have emerged from a profit-ability low in 2002 and be on the verge of aslight easing of their performance situation inthe current financial year.

45Price indicators for
the housing marketPrices on the housing markets have
aroused greater general interest dur-ing the past few years. To some extent,this is due to the fact that in somecountries there have been markedprice increases, which have providedhouse owners with significant gainsand thereby indirectly fostered privateconsumption. At the beginning of the1990s the correction of the housingprice bubble brought entire economiesinto crisis and endangered the stabilityof the financial systems concerned.
In recent times there have not been
any even remotely similar develop-ments in Germany. However, studieson price movements on the propertymarkets and their macroeconomiccauses and effects have so far been dif-ficult owing to the lack of suitableprice indicators. The official statisticscover only the prices of building landand the prices of constructing residen-tial buildings. In addition, the con-sumer price index contains a rent com-ponent.
The following article examines the the-
oretical and practical problems en-countered in drawing up price indicesfor residential property. Furthermore,the Bundesbank has calculated priceindicators for terraced houses andflats; these indicators are presentedbelow, and their strengths and weak-nesses analysed.

46Problems of measurement and ways to
solve them
Calculating property price indices gives rise to
conceptual and, more importantly, practicalproblems which are far in excess of the diffi-culties encountered in the case of other priceindicators.
1The main reason for this is that in
the case of residential property it is not pos-sible to monitor prices for identical propertieson a continuous basis. It is true that a second-ary market for second-hand houses and flatsexists alongside the primary market for newproperty, but these older properties are nor-mally put on the market much later. Conse-quently, any ongoing price observation mustrelate to different properties. The frequentlyapplied “matched models” method, underwhich prices are recorded over time for goodsand services with substantial levels of salesand unchanged characteristics, is not suitablein the case of property. Apart from that, resi-dential buildings are extremely heteroge-neous. No single property is completely iden-tical to the next. It is therefore difficult tomeet the principles of pure price comparisonand representativeness that are essential forprice statistics.
Owing to the immobility of dwellings, which
makes regional equalisation more difficult, lo-cation is the most important pricing deter-minant, regardless of whether the compari-son is being made between or within citiesand towns. According to surveys by BulwienAG, the resale value of a typical flat in Mun-ich, for example, averaged 32,750 per square
metre in 2002 while a similar flat in Frankfurtam Main cost 32,350 but only 31,900 inwest Berlin. In smaller towns such as Bruns-
wick, Aachen or Ulm the price per squaremetre was even lower at between 31,200
and 31,600. However, substantial differences
also exist within the towns mentioned. Forexample, properties in outlying areas, as arule, fetch prices that are far below average.According to the regional committee of sur-veyors in Lower Saxony (Nieders/C228chsischerOberer Gutachterausschuss), for example,benchmark prices of building land for individ-ual dwellings in Brunswick at the beginningof 2003 ranged from 3105 to 3270 per
square metre depending on the site.
Diverging trends are more important for the
purposes of a price comparison over timethan these differences in levels. While theprices of second-hand flats in Frankfurt amMain have increased by almost 45% since1990, they have increased by about 35% inMunich. Property in west Berlin became con-siderably more expensive in the run-up toGerman reunification and immediately after-wards but subsequently fell in price again.Differing price trends can also be observed insmaller towns.
The size of the plot or living space as well as
the characteristics and configuration of thedwellings are also major price determinants.Changes in these features over time are ofparticular importance for preparing data foran intertemporal price comparison. After all,

47the purpose of a price index is not to indicate
changes in average expenditure to acquirehouses and flats where that includes a greateror lesser outlay for differences in location orchanges in quality. Instead, the aim is to shownothing more than price movements for afixed quality in a given location. To that end,prices must be reduced to a uniform standardand quality-related differences eliminated.
It can be assumed that major technical ad-
vances are steadily being made in the qualityof residential property. Considerable progressis being achieved in the case of insulation andheating technology, in particular. Then thereare more sophisticated floor coverings andmore lavish sanitary fittings. On the otherhand, owing to the increasing shortage ofland as a result of the growing populationdensity, especially in the conurbations, a ten-dency to build dwellings more closely to-gether has been observed. As a rule, terracedhouses are now being erected on smallerplots of ground than was the case 20 yearsago. Another point is that in the thriving con-urbations new buildings are frequently beingerected farther from the town and citycentres than before. Building regulations arealso being relaxed, and accustomed stand-ards diluted (for example, the absence ofcellars).
Finally, the year in which a dwelling was built
is important in the case of second-hand prop-erty. However, the decline in the value of aproperty associated with wear and tear andincreasing age can be offset by renovationand maintenance. Often extensions and re-modelling projects of a value-enhancing na-ture are also undertaken. It can therefore be
readily argued that there is no firm connec-tion between the age of a property and itsprice.

ties dating from certain periods sell at a pre-mium over other houses because they meetAnnual averages, log scale

The simplest method of calculating a propertyprice index is the unit value method. Here,the average of the aggregate prices or of theprices of a sample of the houses and flatssold in a given period is compared with theaverage figure obtained in the comparableperiod. Consequently, such an index showsthe change in the average transaction value,including all differences in quality and loca-tion. It is therefore not entirely suited to ana-lysing price developments with respect to theproperty stock. Structural effects dominatethe flow of the index and obscure the reallyinteresting feature, namely the price move-ments themselves, especially in the case ofsmall samples and fairly extensive changes inthe composition of the whole. When, for ex-ample, a year with many transactions in Mun-ich follows a year with many transactions inBerlin, a unit value index rises if only becauseof the higher price level in Munich, even ifprices did not change either in Munich or inBerlin.
To limit such structural effects the typical case
method uses only prices of similar propertiessuch as terraced houses, new dwellings, satis-factory level of comfort, average to goodlocation and floor area of approximate100 square metres. Sometimes a further spe-cification, the price per square metre, isadded. To counteract the effects of location,separate sub-indexes are calculated for vari-ous regions. By using suitable weightings, it ispossible to combine these regional indexes toobtain an indicator for a specific type of
dwelling. Finally, a general index for the hous-ing market can be calculated from the indi-vidual indexes.

Owing to the elimination of the crudest struc-tural effects, indexes based on typical casesare far superior methodologically to the unitvalue method. As the types of accommoda-tion are usually broadly defined, however,quality differences and structural effects can-not be completely avoided by this method.Furthermore, qualitative standards such aslevel of comfort change over time, and thismay lead to distortions or inaccuracies in theintertemporal price comparison.
A widely used method for calculating price
indexes of the housing stock, especially inAnglo-Saxon countries, is based on observa-tions of dwellings that have been sold andresold several times and is therefore similar tothe “matched models” method commonlyused in other price statistics. As the locationcomponent and the physical features of ahouse usually do not change much over time(except for the fact that a residential areamay increase or decrease in value owing, forexample, to traffic-related measures, re-assessment of risk factors or population fluc-tuations), this method is used only for com-paring prices of properties that are largely

4Depending on the type of weighting, it is possible to
differentiate between transaction-based indexes and
stock-based indexes. In a transaction-based index the
weights are derived from a compilation of the transac-
tions, and in a stock-based index from the structure of
the accommodation stock.Unit value

49identical. Adjustments in the form of dis-
counts and add-ons naturally have to bemade for wear and tear and for renovationand remodelling work.
Housing price indices based on resales prom-
ise satisfactory results where many dwellingsare frequently bought and sold. If there arefairly long intervals between any two transac-tions, by contrast, there is the problem ofspreading the total price difference overshorter periods such as years or quarters.
5
Furthermore, marketable properties whichare frequently bought and sold can show inthe short to medium term a different pricetrend from dwellings that change hands lessoften, with the result that an index derivedfrom resale data can be distorted.
6Owing
to the comparatively small share of owner-occupied housing and the consequent lowerfrequency in housing turnover, indexes drawnup with this method are less suitable for Ger-many.
Finally, there is the direct evaluation and elim-
ination of quality differences widely used inprice statistics. However, while in the case ofhousing rents the need for a correction of thiskind arises only for wear and tear, renovation,remodelling or new buildings and the datafor a specific property – otherwise – flowunaltered under the “matched models”method into the index, there is always theproblem of quality adjustment when observ-ing prices for houses and flats. Furthermore,the features that potentially affect prices arevery considerable, and their combinations arevaried.The hedonic method where the price of a
dwelling is explained using regression analysisin terms of its features has been developedfor solving complex quality adjustment prob-lems.
7The information on the implicit market
evaluation of various features taken from theoverview can then be used for calculating themean price change of an average bundle offeatures – in other words, of an artificially de-vised dwelling. However, preparing a hedonicindex requires extensive amounts of informa-tion not only on transaction prices but also onthe specifications of the traded dwellings.Such comprehensive collections of data arestill not available for Germany as a whole.
8
5As a rule, this is done by means of an econometric pro-
cedure which explains the price differences through the
timing of the transactions. See, for example, K E Case
and R J Shiller, Prices of single-family homes since 1970:
New indexes for four Cities, New England Economic Re-
view, September/October 1987, pp 45-56.
6See R A Meese and N E Wallace, The construction of
residential housing price indices: A comparison of repeat-
sales, hedonic-regression and hybrid approaches, Journal
of Real Estate Finance and Economics, Vol 14 (1997),
pp 51-73.
7For the application of hedonic regression method for
housing markets see the overview in S Sheppard, Hedonic
analysis of housing markets, Handbook of Regional and
Urban Economics, Vol 3 (1999), Chapter 41, pp 1595-
1635. One practical problem of hedonic indexes is that
not all features and their interdependencies can be taken
into account and therefore quality adjustment remains in-
complete. Consequently, an attempt is sometimes made
to combine indexes based on repeat sales with hedonic
methods or hedonic indexes with information on repeat
sales. For such hybrid models see, for example, B Case
and J M Quigley, The dynamics of real estate prices, The
Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol 73 (1991), pp 50-

vidual regions of the country. For example, R Schulz and

50Official data on German housing market
prices
The official German statistics reflect prices on
the real estate market by listing the prices ofbuilding land, construction prices and hous-ing rents.
To compile building land price statistics the
Federal Statistical Office collects transactionvalues for plots of land in designated buildingareas. Different average purchase prices persquare metre are calculated depending onthe type of building land, size category of thecommunity concerned and region. However,the Federal Statistical Office points out thatthe average values listed can be used only toa limited extent for an intertemporal compari-son because the statistical data from whichthey are derived may consist of varying indi-vidual components.
9For this reason no rates
of change are given either. The statistics goback to 1962; from 1992 there are also separ-ate data on eastern Germany and Germanyas a whole.
10
If, despite these difficulties, a longer-termcomparison is made to ascertain the trend, itshows that average prices for building landhave risen significantly. In 2002 they were ap-proximately four times higher than in 1975.Owing to the absence of an adjustment fordifferences in location, however, this figuregives no direct indication of the “true” extentof the increase. The particularly sharp pricerises shown for the early 1980s and the mid-1990s coincided, for example, with a lownumber of transactions and a general down-turn on the housing market. The high aver-age prices in these periods might be the result
of an absence of transactions in the low-pricesector.
The purpose of the construction price index
for residential buildings is to show develop-ments in the cost of building houses andflats. It comprises highly detailed prices forthe labour and materials deployed in con-structing single and multi-family houses andmulti-purpose buildings. Quality differenceshave to be eliminated when calculating theindex. Given the complexity of building workand the extensive progress that has beenmade in this area, this poses a considerablechallenge.
According to the official statistics, construc-
tion prices have risen by 125% since 1975.The bulk of this increase took place in thesecond half of the 1970s. A further substan-tial spurt occurred in the first half of the1990s. Since then construction prices havestagnated.
The rent component of the consumer price
index (CPI) reflects the quality adjusted trendin rents, excluding heating, plus ancillarycosts (notably water supply and sewagedisposal as well as refuse collection but notenergy). The compilers of the index essentiallyuse the “matched models” method althoughdeductions are made for fairly large main-

of flats coming on to the market in line withtheir share of the total stock. Ancillary costshave been shown separately since 1995.Most of the rents captured are those stem-ming from existing contracts. According tothe official statistics, rents, including ancillarycosts, rose by more than 140% between1975 and 2002. Comparable calculationsusing the hedonic method based on rentsurveys undertaken under the auspices ofthe German Socio-Economic Panel producedsimilar results for the period between 1985and 1998 as the official rent index.
11This
suggests that the CPI provides a more or lessaccurate reflection of the trend in rents.
An approximation of the trend in the cost of
living in owner-occupied dwellings is given inthe CPI by means of the trend in residentialrents, their weighting being more or lessdoubled for this purpose.
12Owner-occupied
dwellings, by contrast, have not yet beenincluded in the Harmonised Index of Con-sumer Prices (HICP), which was introducedin connection with European monetaryunion. This means that the cost of accommo-dation for more than two-fifths of the house-holds in Germany is still largely uncaptured.In other euro-area countries the proportion ofhouseholds that are not taken into accountis actually even greater owing to the largershare of owner-occupied housing. However,as part of a special Europewide study test cal-culations of the price component of expend-iture on newly built owner-occupied housesand flats are now taking place in Germanyand elsewhere. If the quality of these is satis-factory, they may be integrated into the HICP2000 = 100, annual averages, log scale

12A proxy solution of this kind is justified in that the user
cost of capital is approximately equivalent to the rents
obtained on the market if there is a neutral tax system
and market equilibrium. However, using such approaches
presupposes that the CPI follows the concept of a cost-
of-living index. For information on the various concepts

Price indices for residential property
Indices on developments in property prices in
Germany are based on raw data emergingfrom the work undertaken by surveyor com-mittees, estate agents, building and loan as-sociations and mortgage banks.
14It is mainly
a question of determining the right valuationof a property at a specific time comparedwith other properties. Such data cannot beused without qualification for a longitudinalcomparison. This is particularly true if they arebased on qualitative judgements becauseopinions on which features are “up-market”or which location is “good” will probablychange in the course of time.
The indices calculated by the various institu-
tions differ mainly with respect to the extentto which Germany or the housing stock iscovered and the manner in which the “aver-age” is determined. Some indices are restrict-ed to incorporating data on specific types ofproperty in only a few towns while otherscover the entire market. The informativevalue of the indices is often limited by thefact that prices are averaged without anyweighting for differences in quality, locationand site and changes are calculated from this.
The real estate price index for Germany pre-
pared by the Bank for International Settle-ments (BIS) has achieved international recog-nition. This index shows that between 1995and 2001 prices for residential property in
Germany declined by as much as an annualaverage of 2.5%. This figure was calculatedfrom the change in the (unweighted) averageprice of flats of average living quality in fourGerman cities.
15These statistics are often
considered to be representative for the wholeof Germany and have been seen as a sign ofa deflationary trend.
The new price indices for residential property
based on raw data from Bulwien AG andbriefly presented in the May issue of the Bun-desbank’s Monthly Report cover 60 fairly
large towns, including 10 in eastern Ger-many.
16The intention is to take account of
13The fundamental purpose of the HICP is to show price
movements related to the monetary consumption ex-
penditure of households, ie it follows the net acquisition
approach and not, in contrast to the German or US con-
sumer price indices, the rental equivalence approach. In a
number of other countries the change in the user cost of
capital is included in the calculation of the index. See

14Many of the indices calculated by third parties are
based on raw data provided by the German Real Estate
Agents’ Association (Ring Deutscher Makler), which col-
lects market information for the whole of Germany.

Housing Research) and the institute for urban develop-
ment, housing and saving schemes for housing purposes
(Institut f/C252r St/C228dtebau, Wohnungswirtschaft und Bau-

occupied property on a regular basis since 1996. The
index goes back to 1989 and is designed to show devel-
opments in the prices of detached houses and flats on
the basis of data provided by the surveyor committees of
municipalities and local authorities.

although rural areas are still not captured. Inaccordance with the typical case method, theindices are calculated separately for varioustypes of property and region in order to elim-inate the most serious structural effects andare then condensed into overall indicators bymeans of suitable weightings.
The typical properties are terraced houses
offering a satisfactory living standard in aver-age to good locations with approximately100 square metres of living space and owner-occupied dwellings, likewise providing satis-factory living conditions in average to goodlocations, with approximately 70 squaremetres of living space. The total price isshown in the case of terraced houses and theprice per square metre in the case of owner-occupied dwellings. Bulwien AG calculatesretrospectively to 1990 average prices fornew dwellings and for second-hand accom-modation separately; the data prior to 1990refer to new dwellings.
The Bundesbank weights the results from the
individual towns with the respective popula-tion figures in 2000. The constant weightingsused for the combined weighting of the dataon terraced houses and flats are based on theestimated costs recorded for newly com-pleted buildings between 1999 and 2001. Inthe case of resales the constant shares of therelative size of living space in terraced housesand owner-occupied dwellings were derivedfrom the additional microcensus survey in1998 and construction statistics between1996 and 2000.

54According to this calculation, the prices of
new terraced houses and owner-occupieddwellings hardly changed in Germany in the1980s following a sharp increase in the1970s. With the cyclical upturn in the secondhalf of the 1980s and the opening of the bor-ders in 1989 prices rose continually until themid-1990s, but a slight downward correctionset in later. Adjustment was much more pro-nounced in eastern Germany than in westernGermany. Although this meant that the pricesof houses and flats have fallen by a total ofapproximately 2% in Germany since 1995,they have not declined by up to 15% as theywould have done according to other calcula-tions.
The new housing price data show no sign of
the very pronounced cyclical fluctuations forGermany as a whole that occur in many other
countries. Instead, the rises and falls in hous-ing prices are much more moderate. Whereasin the United Kingdom, for example, annualgrowth rates of far more than 10%, and sub-stantial price reductions, too, have not beenunusual, price changes in Germany in thepast 25 years have ranged from -2
1/C252%t o
+9%.18
The discrepancies, in some cases fairly largeones, between movements in the prices ofnew and second-hand dwellings are striking.According to the available information, pricesof houses and flats on the secondary marketincreased by 20% between 1990 and 2002but only by 14% on the primary market. Thismight be connected with the fact that livingin town centres is again being regarded asmore attractive and therefore demand forsecond-hand property has increased. How-ever, it is probable that at least part of thereason for the differences is the changedcomposition of the stock, notably of newlybuilt dwellings, due, for example, to a shift inbuilding to the outskirts of towns or a reduc-tion in the size of building plots owing to theincreasing scarcity of building land.

18According to calculations by the European Central
Bank, Structural factors in the EU housing markets,
March 2003, p 19, the volatility of the trend-adjusted real
house prices, measured in terms of the standard devi-
ation in many European countries, has been greater than
10 percentage points in the past 20 years. A similar calcu-
lation based on the new data for Germany shows a
standard deviation in the trend-adjusted prices of around
7 percentage points.

55Property prices in a macroeconomic
context
In view of the many methodological and
practical difficulties encountered in calculat-ing property price indices, the question arisesas to the plausibility of the indicators for Ger-man residential property presented here. Anappropriate plausibility check may be madeby undertaking a comparison with the officialprice indicators for the housing market andkey macroeconomic variables. First, the long-term quality of the indicators is to be exam-ined, and, second, the plausibility of the cyc-lical fluctuations. The comparison is essential-ly restricted to the index for new dwellingsavailable in a long series.
It is immediately striking that, according to
the available statistics, the major cost factorsfor housebuilding, namely land and construc-tion work, rose much more sharply, at aroundan average of 5
1/C252% and 3% respectively per
year, between 1975 and 2002 than those fornew residential dwellings, which rose at anaverage of no more than 2
1/C254%. There may
be a number of reasons for such a large dis-crepancy between costs and prices. It is con-ceivable, for example, that there was a statis-tically unrecorded deterioration in the qualityof houses and flats, which was due, amongother things, to the use of smaller plots ofbuilding land. Another possible reason whichcannot be ruled out is that the official dataon land prices and construction prices showan upward distortion. It might be, for ex-ample, that quality improvements were notadequately eliminated from the constructionprices.At almost 3
1/C254% per year, residential rents
likewise rose much faster over the long termthan property prices. Undoubtedly this waspartly due to the ancillary housing costs,which are included in the rents contained inthe consumer price index and which in-creased much more quickly over extensiveperiods of the years under review than thenet rents excluding ancillary costs. Even so,this factor alone can hardly explain the totaldifference between movements in rents andmovements in prices. Over the medium termrents and prices should actually move at thesame pace because rents represent the op-portunity costs of own use and, conversely,tenants can also switch to buying their ownaccommodation.
20This means that, if, from
an economic point of view, renting accom-modation had really become discernibly moreexpensive than buying during the periodunder review, there would have to have beena significant shift towards ownership. How-ever, the proportion of households living inowner-occupied dwellings in western Ger-many rose by no more than approximately36% in 1975 to slightly more than 44% in2002.
21Over the longer term any lagging of
property prices behind rents might be due tothe current reduction in population; however,it is unclear to what extent this has alreadyplayed a role in the period under review.
20However, the larger transaction costs and the need to
have ready capital for home ownership will probably
check price equalisation. Fiscal and statutory promotional
provisions and regulations governing the rented housing
sector and the use of land also play a role.
21In Italy the proportion of households living in owner-
occupied property rose from 61 % to 81% in the period
from 1980 to 2000 and in the Netherlands from 42 % to
53%. See European Central Bank, Structural Factors in
the EU Housing Markets, Frankfurt am Main, 2003, p 26.Long-term and

56Comparing the official price indicators for the
housing market suggests that the housingprice index possibly does not fully capture thelong-term price rise on the housing market.Comparing housing prices with disposable in-come also points in this direction. Since 1975disposable income has risen by an average of4
1/C252% per year, ie about twice as fast as the
prices of houses and flats. Even in per-inhabitant terms it was still as much as 4
1/C254%.
That would mean that the prices of housesand flats would not only have risen moreslowly than disposable income but also moreslowly than the cost of living, which had risenby just over 2
1/C252%. This is rather unlikely even
if, at the beginning of the observation period,relatively high rates of inflation and tax meas-ures to foster home ownership could have in-flated prices.
22Sluggish price movements
during the 1980s would then have been seento some extent as a correction of excessiveprices after expectations with respect to infla-tion had moderated and the fiscal promotionof home ownership had been reduced. How-ever, the faster growth in the selling prices ofsecond-hand dwellings in the 1990s indicatesthat the aforementioned factors presumablycannot fully explain why the price rise ob-served in the case of new properties laggedbehind building prices, rents and disposableincome. A long-term analysis must thereforetake account of an area of uncertainty thatcannot by exactly quantified. The series fornew properties probably tends to understatethe longer-term price trend in the propertysector somewhat.
The short to medium-term trend in property
prices and the extent to which these led orfollowed other indicators are relevant to the
cyclical analysis. This is to be shown by takingas an example the timing of the responses tothe demand shock at the end of the 1980sand beginning of the 1990s which resulted,in part, from the opening of the borders andeconomic unification. The largest annual in-crease in property prices, ie just over 7%, wasrecorded in 1990. This was also the year withthe sharpest growth in disposable income(+8.2%). Building prices reached their highestgrowth rate, 7.6%, a year later. Only the offi-cial rent index, with a maximum increase in1993 (+5.8%) and building land, likewisewith +5.8%, were slower to respond.
In the case of rents this can be explained by
the special features of pricing on this market.While new rents can be freely set within cer-tain limits, increases in rents on existing con-tracts follow with a time lag as a result of theusual longer-term contracts and the compar-able rents system. Indices for newly contract-ed rents, drawn up on the basis of data pro-vided by Bulwien AG, show the greatest rateof increase, namely 12
1/C252% in 1990, but in
the long term the trend is not much differentfrom the rent index of the consumer priceindex.
23The delayed response of building
land prices, as shown in the statistics, is pre-

rents for dwellings of approximately 70 square metres in
average to good locations. Rents for newly built property

57sumably an artefact which has arisen as a re-
sult of changes in the composition of thestock. The sharp rise in investment in con-struction between 1991 and 1994 was asso-ciated with the provision of additional build-ing land; probably less expensive plots of landwere frequently involved here. This confirmsthe opinion of the Federal Statistical Officethat the officially determined average pricesfor building land are not entirely suitable foran intertemporal comparison.
From an economic point of view the timing
of price responses is therefore largely plaus-ible. Property prices increased in step with therise in newly contracted rents; constructionprices followed with a slight delay. Rentsagreed in newly signed contracts began tofall again as early as 1995 owing to the in-creasing supply that resulted from the elasticresponse of construction investment – thenumber of new dwellings ready for occupa-tion went up in western Germany from239,000 in 1989 to more than 500,000 in1994
24– and the almost complete stop in the
increase in incomes. The prices of houses andflats and building prices followed suit a yearlater. The smallest increase was recorded in1999. There was no decline in the officialrents index. This means that the indicatorscalculated on the basis of data supplied byBulwien AG are also proving to be correctduring the fall in the housing market.

58dexes presented here accurately reflect cyclic-
al movements and that there are statisticalinterrelationships between the time series forhouse prices, building prices, rents and in-comes which can be interpreted in economicterms.
25Even so, the index based on resale
prices might be slightly more suited to captur-ing the long-term price trend. Relevant pricedata are available only from 1990, however,with the result that a longer-term check onthis hypothesis is not yet possible.
Outlook
Even if there are doubts about whether the
price indicator for new terraced houses andflats in Germany, presented here, fully reflectsthe long-term upward trend in propertyprices, there is much to be said for the factthat it accurately reflects the cyclical fluctu-ations. Consequently, it may be just as im-portant a source of additional information forthe short to medium-term analysis of eco-nomic developments in Germany as the indexon second-hand property. The leading indica-tor property of house prices vis-/C224-vis the offi-cial rent indexes in the CPI and HICP is alsoimportant here. However, property price indi-cators have so far been calculated only as an
annual average. Efforts are being made to ex-tend this to once a quarter.
The stagnation in prices of residential prop-
erty evident at the current end of the series isto be seen in connection with the sluggishgrowth in disposable incomes or the un-favourable incomes outlook and the amplesupply of accommodation. There are no signsof a slump in property prices, which couldjeopardise the stability of the financial system.The reason for this is that, owing to the elas-tic supply of construction services, Germany,traditionally, does not experience such sharpfluctuations in the prices of residential prop-erty as is reported to be the case in othercountries. Furthermore, the lending limits im-posed by the banks tend to be fixed very cau-tiously, and interest rates are locked in long-term, as a rule.
It is planned to update the property price indi-
cators regularly in future.
25This judgement can also be confirmed with advanced
econometric methods. Whereas the relationships be-
tween incomes, building prices, property prices and resi-
dential rents can be depicted as cointegration models,
this is not possible with building land prices.

59Approaches
to the validation
of internal rating
systemsThe new international capital standard
for credit institutions (Basel II) permitsbanks to use internal rating systems fordetermining the risk weights relevantfor calculating the capital charge. Inreturn the banks are obliged to regu-larly review their rating systems (valid-ation). Regulatory standards for valid-ation are designed to ensure a uniformframework for the prudential certifica-tion and ongoing monitoring of the in-ternal rating systems used.
Validation represents a major chal-
lenge for both banks and supervisors.It is true that the statistical methodsused for quantitative validation areuseful indicators of possible undesir-able developments. As a rule, however,it is not possible to deduce from thema stringent criterion for assessing thesuitability of a rating system. For thisreason qualitative criteria will play animportant role in validation.
It is likely that the methods described
in this article will be further developedand refined in the coming years, notleast owing to the increasing availabil-ity of reliable data. In particular, thefuture discussions generated both byresearch and banking practice will pro-vide additional insights into themethods used for estimating the riskparameters.
Rating systems serve to determine the credit

60methods, rating scores are assigned to indi-
vidual borrowers to indicate their degree ofcreditworthiness.
In view of the envisaged prudential recogni-
tion of banks’ internal rating systems underthe two IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) ap-proaches, the problems associated with theirquantitative and qualitative validation are cur-rently the subject of much discussion. Theterm validation denotes the entire process ofassessing an internal rating system, from val-idating its discriminatory power to process-oriented validation (“use test”). The chart onthis page gives an overview of the main com-ponents of the validation process for ratingsystems.The task of validating rating systems is closely
connected with the validation of additionalrisk parameters that are derived from the rat-ing assessments and which, under the IRB ap-proaches of the new Basel minimum require-ments (Basel II), largely determine the amountof capital which a bank needs to maintain.This article examines the problems associatedwith validation without expressing any pru-dential choice for or against particularmethods. It reflects some of the best practicesas ascertained from a survey of Germanbanks carried out in the spring of 2003.

61character of the rating system in use. A basic
distinction is drawn between model-basedsystems and systems based on expert judge-ment.
Model-based systems, such as discriminant
analysis or various kinds of regression analy-sis, are typically developed on the basis of his-torical default data. If such data are not avail-able on a sufficient scale, many practitionersresort to a “shadow rating” which adopts thecredit assessment of external rating agencies.A feature shared by all model-based systemsis that – using statistical methods – they cap-ture a number of risk factors (eg total expos-ure, equity capital or sector/profession) in arisk ratio (rating score).
If little statistically significant information is
available or if the credit operations are of ma-terial importance or complex, the bank willnormally rely instead on expert judgement. Insuch a rating system, too, a standardised pro-cedure is normally applied for assigning theratings. The main difference between thisand model-based methods is that there is nostatistical modelling of the rating score.
In practice, the most common methods used
are hybrid forms combining elements of bothtypes of rating system. In such hybrid systemsthe responsible credit expert can correct themodel-based rating if he has information ofwhich the model-based rating system takesno or insufficient account.
All rating systems – whether model-based or
based on expert judgement – can essentiallybe validated by quantitative means. However,a quantitative validation requires a sufficient
number of loan defaults. This requirement istypically met in the case of retail business, ieloans to small and medium-sized enterprisesor to individuals. The principal criteria for thequantitative validation of a rating system areits discriminatory power, its stability and itscalibration.
Discriminatory power and stabilityThe discriminatory power of a rating system
denotes its ability to discriminate ex ante be-
tween defaulting and non-defaulting borrow-ers. The discriminatory power can be assessedusing a number of statistical measures of dis-crimination, some of which are described indetail in the Annex to this article. However,the absolute measure of the discriminatorypower of a rating system is only of limitedmeaningfulness. A direct comparison of dif-ferent rating systems, for example, can onlybe performed if statistical “noise” is takeninto account. Such a comparison must bebased on the same dataset.
Moreover, the discriminatory power should
be tested not only in the development data-set but also in an independent dataset (out-of-sample validation). Otherwise there is adanger that the discriminatory power may beoverstated by over-fitting to the developmentdataset. In this case the rating system willthen frequently exhibit a relatively low dis-criminatory power on datasets that are inde-pendent of but structurally similar to the de-velopment dataset. Hence the rating systemwould have a low stability.

62One way of assessing the stability of a model-
based rating system is to measure the statis-tical significance of the risk factors applied. Inaddition, a test should be made to ascertainany correlation effects. High or unstable cor-relations may adversely affect the stability ofthe rating system.
CalibrationUnder both IRB approaches of Basel II, a
bank’s capital requirements are determinedby internal estimations of the risk parametersfor each exposure. These are derived in turnfrom the bank’s internal rating scores. Thesenotably include the borrower’s Probability ofDefault (PD) and, for the advanced IRB ap-proach, the expected Loss Given Default(LGD) as well as the Exposure At Default(EAD). In this connection one also speaks ofthe calibration of the rating system. As therisk parameters can be determined by thebank itself, the quality of the calibration is adecisive prudential criterion for assessing rat-ing systems.
Not only the PD but also the LGD and the
EAD are random variables as they are notfully known to the bank when rating borrow-ers’ creditworthiness. They depend, in par-ticular, on the intrinsic value of the collateraland on the amount of credit drawn down bythe time of the default. Unlike the PD, how-ever, these parameters have to be estimatedby the bank itself only under the advancedIRB approach, whereas under the IRB founda-tion approach they are laid down by thesupervisors.Criteria for assessing the quality
of rating systems
Discriminatory power:
The discriminatory power of rating systems
denotes their ex ante capability to identify
borrowers who are in danger of defaulting.Thus a rating system with maximum discrim-inatory power would be able to preciselyidentify in advance all borrowers who sub-sequently default. In practice, however,such perfect rating systems do not exist. Arating system is said to have a high discrim-inatory power if the “good” grades subse-quently turn out to contain only a smallpercentage of defaulters and a large per-centage of non-defaulters, with the con-verse applying to the “poor” grades.
Stability:
A characteristic feature of a stable rating
system is that it adequately models thecause-effect relationship between the riskfactors and creditworthiness. It avoids spuri-ous dependencies based on empirical cor-relations. In contrast to stable systems, un-stable systems frequently show a sharplydeclining level of forecasting quality overtime.
Accuracy of calibration:
Calibration normally denotes the mapping
of the Probabilities of Default (PD) to therating grades. A rating system is well cali-brated if the estimated PDs deviate onlymarginally from the actual default rates.Used in a broader sense, the calibration ofthe rating system also includes the map-ping of additional risk parameters, such asthe Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Ex-posure At Default (EAD).

63There are several tried and tested statistical
methods for deriving the PDs (Probabilities ofDefault) from a rating system. Firstly, a dis-tinction needs to be drawn between directand indirect methods. In the case of the directmethods, such as Logit, Probit and HazardRate models, the rating score itself can betaken as the borrower’s PD. The PD of a givenrating grade is then normally calculated asthe mean of the PDs of the individual borrow-ers assigned to each grade.
Where the rating score cannot be taken as
the PD (as in the case of discriminant analy-sis), one may resort to indirect methods. Onesimple method consists of estimating the PDfor each rating grade from historical defaultrates. Another method is the estimation ofthe score distributions of defaulting borrow-ers, on the one hand, and non-defaultingborrowers, on the other. A specific PD cansubsequently be assigned to each borrowerusing Bayes’ Formula.
In practice a bank’s PD estimates will differ
from the default rates actually observed sub-sequently. The key question is whether thedeviations are purely random or whether theyoccur systematically. A systematic underesti-mation of PDs merits a critical assessment –from the point of view of supervisors andbankers alike – since in this case the bank’scomputed capital requirement would not beadequate to the risk it has incurred.
Various statistical methods of assessing the
estimation quality of PDs are discussed in theacademic literature. Most of these methodsare based on backtesting. However, thesemethods display shortcomings in practice
which argue against their mechanical applica-tion. These can be illustrated by means of thebinomial test, the technical details of whichare described in the Annex.
The binomial test was first incorporated into
prudential practice in connection with thebacktesting of market risk models. For the as-sessment of PDs, too, it is possible to con-struct a statistical test (using simplified as-sumptions) based on the binomial distribu-tion. It is assumed that the defaults per ratinggrade are statistically independent. Under thehypothesis that the estimated PDs of the rat-ing grades are correct, the actually observablenumber of defaults per rating grade after oneyear would then be binomially distributed. Ifmajor differences are evident between thedefault rate and the estimated PD of the rat-ing grade, the hypothesis of a correct estima-tion must be rejected. The rating modelwould thus be poorly calibrated.
One problem associated with this test is the
assumption that the defaults of the borrow-ers constitute independent events. In reality,however, the defaults are more or less strong-ly correlated owing to cyclical influences. The-oretically, a solution to this problem would beconceivable if the default correlations wereknown. But determining the default correl-ations is difficult. Hence even a modified bi-nomial test is suitable at most as an indicatorof a good or poor calibration.
Another approach to the statistical validation
of PDs is the use of benchmark portfolios. Inbanking practice, for example, using external

64data from rating agencies and other commer-
cial providers as a benchmark is widespread.Systematic deviations of the bank’s internalestimates from the estimates in the bench-mark portfolio would have to be checked.Benchmarking can serve as a useful comple-ment to the validation process. However, theusefulness of this approach depends verymuch on the choice of a suitable benchmarkportfolio. The choice of a benchmark rating islikewise generally not an easy task.
Besides an estimation of the PD, the IRB ad-
vanced approach under Basel II will also per-mit banks to themselves estimate the LGD(Loss Given Default) and the EAD (ExposureAt Default). A quantitative validation of theLGDs consists in verifying the bank’s internalestimates. The LGD of bank loans is deter-mined mainly by the realisation of the loancollateral. If a loan is not repaid, the credit in-stitution does not know how high the actualloss is until the liquidation period is termin-ated. The liquidation period may vary greatly,depending on the precise features of the loanand, in particular, on the collateral. As a ruleit is between 18 months and three years, butin exceptional cases it may even exceed tenyears.
In order to calculate the actual loss it is neces-
sary to take account of all payment streamsthat flow during the liquidation process and,where appropriate, to assign them to individ-ual collateral items. The payment streamscomprise payments made to the bank andpayments which the bank itself has to make.The former consist primarily of partial pay-ments made by the borrower or of proceedsfrom realising collateral. The latter consist, for
example, of lawyer’s costs, court costs pluscumulative interest charges and refinancingcosts during the liquidation process. Giventhe duration of the liquidation process, thepayment streams have to be discounted be-fore the actual economic LGD can be calcu-lated.
A number of statistical studies already exist
which can be used to determine the LGDs ofexchange-traded corporate bonds. By con-trast, standardised databases concerninglosses from unsecured loans are still at a rudi-mentary stage of development. But in thecase of unsecured loans, too, it is likely thatthe LGDs are very much sector-specific andare strongly correlated with the default rates.The LGD database must capture the lossescompletely and must also contain those de-faulted loans where the unsecured shareshave not led to losses. The exclusive inclusionof loans that have actually led to losses wouldlead to an overstating of the LGD. It is alsocommon for several loans to be secured byone and the same collateral item (eg a globalland charge). As a rule a credit institution willtry to estimate a separate realisation rate foreach category of collateral. In the case ofglobal collateral the collateral must be distrib-uted across the individual loans.
Like the LGD, the validation of the EAD (Ex-
posure At Default) is based on the verificationof the bank’s internal estimates. For balancesheet assets the Basel minimum requirementsenvisage that the estimated values must notbe less than the currently drawn creditamount (though netting effects may be taken

65into account). For derivative transactions the
credit equivalent amount is calculated fromthe replacement cost plus an add-on for fu-ture potential liabilities. The supplementaryprudential requirements in respect of thebank’s internal estimates of the EAD are thusconcentrated on off-balance-sheet transac-tions. A central problem is determining thedrawn share of credit line amounts at thetime of default. Studies indicate that thereare significant correlations between the EADand the residual maturity of the loan, and be-tween the EAD and the borrower’s credit rat-ing. Additional utilisation of the credit linetends to increase the EAD in accordance withthe length of the residual maturity of theloan. This is plausible, since the longer the re-sidual maturity of a loan, the greater is theprobability that the borrower’s credit ratingwill deteriorate and his potential access to al-ternative financing sources will diminish.Other study findings indicate that the degreeof utilisation of the credit line by the time ofdefault tends to decrease in accordance withthe quality of the borrower’s credit rating atthe time the credit line was granted. The ar-gument put forward to explain this is that,faced with a borrower with a poor credit rat-ing, a bank will insert clauses into the creditagreement that hamper his utilisation of theapproved credit line in the event of a furtherdeterioration in his rating.
The estimates can be greatly simplified if de-
pendencies on the creditworthiness and theresidual maturity do not have to be taken intoaccount. However, this harbours the risk thatneglecting these dependencies may systemat-ically distort the estimates for the credit util-
isation.
Qualitative aspects of validation
The quantitative validation methods have to
be complemented by qualitative – ie non-statistical – methods. Qualitative validationserves not least to safeguard the applicabilityof quantitative methods. In these cases thequalitative validation will have to be per-formed before the quantitative validation.The qualitative analyses primarily test threeaspects: the design of the rating models, thequality of the data for the rating developmentand deployment as well as the internal use ofthe rating system in the credit-granting pro-cess (“use test”).
Testing the model design plays a major role in
the case of model-based systems, in particu-lar, but not just for these. This is especiallytrue whenever a quantitative validation issubject to limitations owing to the dataset. Inany case the process of assigning the ratingmust be transparent and well documented.The influence of the risk factors should be dis-cretely disaggregated and economicallyplausible. In addition, the demonstration ofstatistical foundation is crucial in the case ofmodel-based systems.
A bank should, as a general rule, pay close at-
tention to the integrity of its data and theirconsistent collection. Only a sound databasewith a sufficiently large data history makespossible the development of a high-qualityrating system and reliable estimates of the

66prudentially stipulated risk parameters. If the
credit institution itself has only a small data-base of default information, it may resort ifnecessary – as mentioned above – to externaldata sources.
A second major criterion for the qualitative
validation of internal rating systems is the ac-tual use of rating results in banks’ internal riskmanagement and reporting. This kind ofqualitative validation tests the design of theinternal bank processes and is therefore re-ferred to as “process-oriented validation”. Ex-amples of credit risk management using rat-ing systems include ratings-based credit deci-sions and credit-granting competencies, acredit risk strategy geared to rating gradesand correspondingly structured limit systems.In all of these applications a credit institutionbases important business policy decisions onthe risk assessment generated by internal rat-ings.
From a prudential point of view the way in
which the bank uses its rating system for in-ternal decision-making processes reflects theconfidence it has in its own system. Whereverbanks’ own rating systems are not used in-ternally or are used only for individual, isol-ated purposes, this can be interpreted as aninternal assessment of the (deficient) qualityof the rating systems. A rating system that isnot sufficiently integrated into the bank’s in-ternal credit processes will therefore not re-ceive prudential approval.
The quantification of risk, expressed in PDs
and realisation or LGD rates, should likewisebe used for the bank’s internal purposes. Themost important example of this is the calcula-
tion of the standard risk costs as part of con-tribution margin costing. The calculation ofrisk provisions based on standard risk costs isanother conceivable indicator of the internaluse of rating systems.
In addition, the Basel minimum requirements
for internal rating systems stipulate that rat-ing decisions must not be influenced by otherbusiness divisions that profit from the creditdecision either directly or indirectly. A particu-larly important requirement is the independ-ent assignment of ratings when using expertjudgements. In these cases the final ratingcompetence must lie with the back officestaff and not the front office staff. This ap-plies even more so if the sales staff are remu-nerated according to the volume of transac-tions concluded. One of the qualitative cri-teria is therefore that the initial rating pro-posal, which may potentially be made by thecustomer account staff, must be reviewedand confirmed by an independent third party.
Other key points of the validation process are
appropriate training for the staff and the ac-ceptability of the rating systems to theirusers. These must have a good understandingof the rating system and actually apply therating system in everyday business.

67idated. The task of the supervisors is to certify
the rating systems and to continuously moni-tor compliance with these minimum require-ments by the bank. In the context of this pro-cess the bank’s internal validation proceduresalso have to be assessed. In this connectioncentral credit registers can play an importantrole. The Basel Committee on Banking Super-vision is therefore currently considering theirpossible application for this purpose.
The main precondition for using a central
credit register for prudential purposes is theavailability of information about loan de-faults, banks’ internal rating grades and thecollateralisation of the loans. This informationis already available in part on the centralcredit registers of certain countries. A centralcredit register has the advantage over the al-ternative of individual enquiries, by virtue ofstandardised borrower IDs, of being able tocompare the rating of different banks for oneand the same borrower (benchmarking). Thesample selected for the comparison could bedefined flexibly. Moreover, the reporting sys-tem would cover the entire range of banks.
Another field of application of credit registers
in connection with validation questions isbacktesting. As explained above, backtestinginvolves comparing the estimated PDs withthe actually observed defaults. In principle,this would make it possible to test banks’ in-ternal quantitative validation.
Thus central credit registers could, in prin-
ciple, play a supporting role in the prudentialcertification of rating systems and their over-sight. Depending on the scale of the investi-gations which this would necessitate, this
would require making modifications to thecentral credit registers in their current form.This should be decided on the basis of carefulcost/benefit considerations. The primary ap-plication of central credit registers will prob-ably be the benchmarking of estimates of dif-ferent credit institutions. By contrast, the useof credit registers for backtesting comes upagainst limits owing to the high degree of de-tail required for the relevant credit informa-tion.
Outlook
Banks and banking supervisors are currently
preparing intensively for the validation of rat-ing systems. With a view to further develop-ing the approaches to validation, a workinggroup for validation issues has been set upunder the stewardship of the Research TaskForce of the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision. The steep increase in the numberof publications on this subject in recent yearsshows that academics are also consideringthis question. However, the suitability of indi-vidual methods is still disputed. One thingthat is certain is that the assessment of in-ternal rating systems cannot be based on asingle validation method but instead willemerge as the synthesis of various quantita-tive and qualitative methods. The current dis-cussion will lead to the further refinement ofvalidation methods. In addition, the qualityand quantity of the available data will im-prove substantially in the coming years. Theresulting insights will be incorporated into theprudential validation standards.

Statistical measures of discriminatory power
The CAP curve provides a graphical illustration of
the discriminatory power of a rating process. Forthis purpose, the creditworthiness indicator (score)of every borrower is established for the dataset tobe used to examine the rating model’s discrimin-atory power. This score can be continuous, for in-stance the result of a discriminant analysis or aLogit regression, or it may be an integer which rep-resents the rating grade to which the borrower hasbeen assigned. In the following analysis, it is as-sumed that a high score is a reflection of a goodrating. In a first step the borrowers are arranged inan ascending order of scores. The CAP curve isthen determined by plotting the cumulative per-centage of all borrowers (“alarm rate”) on thehorizontal axis and the cumulative percentage ofall defaulters (“hit rate”) on the vertical axis. This isshown in the adjacent chart. If, for example, those30% of all debtors with the lowest rating scoresinclude 70% of all defaulters, the point (0.3;0.7)lies on the CAP curve. The steeper the CAP curveat the beginning, the more accurate the rating pro-cess. Ideally, the rating process would give all de-faulters the lowest scores. The CAP curve wouldthen rise linearly at the beginning before becominghorizontal. The other extreme would be a purelyrandom rating classification. Such a rating processwould not have any discriminatory power. The ex-pected CAP curve would, in this case, be identicalto the diagonal. In reality, rating classifications areneither perfect nor random. The correspondingCAP curve therefore runs between these two ex-tremes. Using the CAP curve, the discriminatorypower of a rating process can be aggregated intoa single figure, the so-called “Gini coefficient”
1
(GC). In the above chart, the area between theperfect rating and the random rating is denoted by

random rating is denoted by a R. The Gini coeffi-

69mined. The result could be similar to that shown in
the chart on page 70. Next, a score C is set. Usingthis score C, it is possible to define a simpledecision-making rule for identifying potential de-faulters. All borrowers with a score greater than Care deemed to be creditworthy and those with alower score are deemed to be not creditworthy.One of the features of a good rating system is thatit has as high a hit rate as possible (correct classifi-cation of a borrower as a potential defaulter) andat the same time as low a false alarm rate as pos-sible (incorrect classification of a creditworthy bor-rower as a potential defaulter). In order to analysethe discriminatory power of a rating system irre-spective of the chosen cut-off value C, both thefalse alarm rate and the hit rate are calculated forevery C between the maximum and the minimumscore. The points determined in this way yield theROC curve (see adjacent chart). The steeper theROC curve at the beginning, the more accuratethe rating system. In a perfect rating system, theROC curve would be plotted solely on the line de-fined by the points (0;0), (0;1) and (1;1). In a purelyrandom rating system, the ROC curve would beplotted exactly along the diagonal in the adjacentchart.
As for the CAP curve, an aggregated ratio can also
be given for the ROC curve. This ratio results fromthe area under the ROC curve and is called theAUC. The AUC ratio is always between zero andone. The closer the AUC is to one, the more accur-ate the rating system. The connection between theAUC and the GC as well as the statistical proper-ties of the AUC and the GC are dealt with in thenext section. The equivalence of the AUC and theGC is a key result. It is possible to convert one ratiointo the other through a simple linear transform-ation.Another measure of discriminatory power widely
applied in practice is the minimum classificationerror rate, the calculation of which is illustrated inthe chart on page 70. The classification error rateis the term used to describe the mean of the rela-tive frequencies for defaulters and non-defaulterswho were incorrectly classified with a cut-off valueof C. The fraction of defaulters who were deemedto be creditworthy in view of the cut-off value Ccorresponds to the area to the right of C under thedefaulters’ score distribution curve. Similarly, thefraction of non-defaulters who were incorrectlyclassified as not creditworthy corresponds to thearea to the left of C under the non-defaulters’score distribution curve. The classification errorrate is obtained by halving the total content ofthese two areas. The minimum classification errorrate is obtained by calculating the classificationerror rate for every C value between the minimum

Statistical properties of the GC and the AUCThere is a simple linear relationship between the
Gini coefficient (GC) and the area under the ROCcurve (AUC) as two measures of discriminatorypower, ie.
GC¼2/C1AUC /C01:
In the following, the statistical properties of mainly
the AUC will be described as these can be inter-preted more illustratively. The equivalent properties
can be obtained for the GC using the precedingequation.
If all pair combinations of one defaulter and one
non-defaulter are formed, the Mann-Whitney stat-istic can be defined as
Uða;b;cÞ¼

where N Dis the number of defaulters and N NDis
the number of solvent debtors. The expressionu
D,ND is defined as
uD;ND¼a;if SD<SND
b;if SD¼SND/C1
c;if SD>SND8

:
Here, S Dis the defaulter’s rating score and S NDis
the solvent borrower’s rating score. The relation-ship
AUC¼Uð1;0:5;0Þ
can be proven for the AUC as a measure of dis-
criminatory power. If the definition of U is takeninto account, one obtains
AUC¼PðS
D<SNDÞþ0:5PðSD¼SNDÞ:
This equation can be explained in illustrative terms.
If one debtor is randomly chosen from all of thedefaulters and one debtor is randomly chosenfrom all of the solvent borrowers, one would as-sume that the borrower with the higher ratingscore is the solvent borrower. If both borrowershave the same rating score, then lots are drawn.The probability that the solvent borrower can beidentified using this decision-making rule turns outto be P(S
D<SND) + 0.5 P(S D=SND). This probability is
identical to the area under the ROC curve.Deutsche BundesbankProbability densities of the

71The connection between the area under the ROC
curve and the Mann-Whitney statistic can be usedto calculate confidence intervals for the AUC in arelatively simple manner. Moreover, it also makes itpossible to test for differences between the AUCvalues of two rating systems which are validatedon the same dataset. In both cases, advantage istaken of the fact that the Mann-Whitney statisticor the normed difference between two Mann-Whitney statistics is subject to asymptotically nor-mal distribution. The associated variances can beeasily calculated using the empirical data.

Mathematical description of the binomial test
The following is a description of how the binomial
test works. The binomial test can be used on an in-dividual rating grade. In doing so, it is assumedthat all K debtors in a rating grade have the sameProbability of Default PD. The binomial distributionturns out to be the distribution of default eventswithin the rating grade if it is assumed that the de-fault events are statistically independent. Eachdebtor is assigned an indicator variable I
i, where I i
is given the value one if the debtor defaults, other-wise it is equal to zero. The number of defaultevents D
Kis obtained as follows
DK¼XK
i¼1li/C1The null hypothesis that the actual Probability of
Default at most has a value PD can now be reject-ed at a confidence level /C11if the actual default rate
exceeds a critical value d
K;/C11, which is determined
by
P/C2
DK/C21dK;/C11/C3
/C20/C11:
Using the density of the binomial distribution, d K;/C11
is calculated as
dK;/C11¼min d:PK
i¼d/C16
K
i/C17
PDið1/C0PDÞK/C0i/C20/C11/C26/C27
:
Therefore, the probability that the critical value
dK;/C11is exceeded under the assumption of binomial
distribution is at most /C11. In determining d K;/C11,i ti s
assumed that all of the default events in a ratinggrade are independent. This is not the case in real-ity as default rates fluctuate in the business cycleand thus default events are correlated with one an-other. As a consequence, the binomial test gener-ally underestimates d
K;/C11. The binomial test is there-
fore a conservative indicator of the quality of cali-bration of a rating grade’s Probability of Default.
2The relevant formulas are deliberately not given in full
here. They are very complex. However, this is not a con-
straint for the users of these methods as the methods
have been integrated into the commonly-used statistical
software packages.Confidence
