IndustryBusiness activity in industry remained sub-
dued over the past few months. The volumeof new orders did go up sharply in May, re-sulting in orders in the two spring months ofApril and May being 3
14% up on the first
quarter. This was, however, mainly due toseveral large-scale orders, particularly in thesector involving the “manufacture of othertransport equipment” (ships and boats, air-craft, railways). The current figures thereforeoverstate the underlying cyclical pace.
All of these major orders came from custom-
ers abroad. This led to a seasonally adjustedincrease in foreign orders of nearly 6
12%i n
April and May compared with the first quar-ter. The year-on-year increase was 6
34%,
which followed a slight decline in the firstfew months of this year.
The flow of domestic orders had benefited to
some extent in April from backlog effects ori-ginating in March (in which the Easter holidayshad fallen), but slowed down again signifi-cantly in May. Taking the two spring monthstogether, there was still a seasonally adjustedgrowth of just under 1% compared with thefirst quarter, however. The year-on-year de-cline, which had amounted to as much as7
14% on an average of the first quarter of
2002, narrowed to 334%.
According to the provisional data, industrial
output in May was significantly down on theprevious month in seasonally adjusted terms.Orders

6Overall output in April and May failed to
match the level of the first quarter. The de-cline is likely to become even larger, since adownward adjustment may be expectedwhen the final figures for May are available.This will mean that the year-on-year fall (cur-rently at -3
14%) is likely to be even more
marked. The decline in output in May is part-ly due to the comparatively large number ofpublic holidays in that month. Such work-freedays are often used as an occasion to taketime off for a short break. Moreover, thestrike in the metal working and electrical en-gineering industry led to hold-ups in produc-tion. In cyclical terms, therefore, May shows adownward distortion.
ConstructionDevelopments in construction still failed to
show any improvement over the past fewmonths. Incoming construction orders fellback again in April (more recent data are un-available at present). This followed a signifi-cant rise in the preceding month, which hadbeen due to one major new order. In season-ally adjusted terms, however, the first-quarterfigure was nearly equalled. As before, how-ever, there was a noticeable decline on theyear amounting to 4
14%. While the order
books in residential construction improvedsomewhat starting from a very low level,both industrial and public sector constructionsuffered a downturn.
Construction output fell back further in May
in seasonally adjusted terms. April and Maytogether were just over 7% down on the firstquarter. The year-on-year figure was -5
12%.Economic conditions in Germany*

7The falls were so severe that they are unlikely
to be offset even by the positive adjustmentto be expected along with the annual overallsurvey.
Labour marketThere was no discernible improvement over
the past few months on the labour marketeither. There was a further decline in employ-ment and unemployment showed a sharp in-crease. According to Federal Statistical Officedata, the fall in the number of persons inwork did, at least, slow down in April (morerecent figures are unavailable at present). Inseasonally adjusted terms, the figure de-creased only slightly to 38.64 million. Muchas before, this was 155,000 persons, or0.4%, fewer than in the same month of2001. Whereas workforce levels in industrycontinued to be cut back significantly up tothe end of the period under review, there hasbeen somewhat less pressure to make redun-dancies in the construction sector of late.Somewhat more than 200,000 employeeswere on reduced working hours in June, ienot quite 95,000 more than one year previ-ously.
Counter to the seasonal trend, there was a
further increase in the number of persons outof work in June. Seasonally adjusted, the fig-ure rose to 4.09 million by the end of themonth. The year-on-year increase went up to260,000 persons. As calculated by the Fed-eral Labour Office, the seasonally adjustedunemployment rate reached 9.8%. Accord-ing to the EU’s standardised definition, thefigure was 8.3%. Both figures signify a fur-
ther slight increase.
A sharp rise in unemployment was recorded
especially in eastern Germany. This was partlydue to the fact that, on account of an earlystart to the school holidays, many young per-sons who had completed their training regis-tered, at least temporarily, as unemployed.However, many persons who had previouslybeen in work were also newly included in theunemployment records.
The number of persons taking part in labour
market policy measures showed a slight sea-sonal fall in June to 520,000. At not quite80,000, the year-on-year decline was some-what less than hitherto. While vocationaltraining schemes showed only a slight de-crease, job creation schemes were cut backmore significantly.
PricesThe price climate continued to become calm-
er in June. Consumer prices remained un-changed in seasonally adjusted terms. Theyear-on-year increase narrowed to 0.8%,having been 1.1% in May. This was mainlydue to lower prices for both food and refinedpetroleum products. Additionally, changes inthe prices of industrial goods remained withinnarrow bounds. This offset the persistent up-ward pressure on prices in the case of servicesas well as the rise in housing rents.
Foreign trade and payments had an alleviat-
ing impact recently. Seasonally adjusted im-port prices fell in May. The year-on-year

8figure, which had previously narrowed to
-2.5%, widened again to -4.3%. At the pro-ducer level, industrial selling prices – after sea-sonal adjustment – remained unchanged inMay. The general price level was still not quite1% lower than one year before. In agriculture,the decline in prices continued in May. In sea-sonally adjusted terms, they fell by 1
12%
month on month. Compared with the level inthe corresponding period of 2001 – which,admittedly, had been exceptionally high onaccount of the BSE and foot-and-mouthdisease crises – the moderation in pricesamounted to 8.2%.
Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
In May the indebtedness of central, state and
local government increased relatively moder-ately by 31.7 billion. Net government borrow-
ing, however, was notably understated by thefact that the resources used to refinance abond issue of the ERP Special Fund amount-ing to 32.4 billion – which was redeemed in
early May – had already been raised in April.The rise in central government debt (+ 31.8
billion) was due mainly to the monthly issueof Treasury discount paper (Bubills), whichyielded 34.9 billion. No Bubill redemptions
were made. With the exception of a positivebalance (+ 30.4 billion) on Federal Treasury
notes (Schätze), all other types of debt re-corded net redemptions. Money market liabil-ities were also significantly reduced (- 31.2 bil-
lion).Although net borrowing by state government
was quite high, amounting to 32.2 billion, it
was lower than the levels recorded in the pre-vious two months. The issuance of Treasurynotes, which raised 35.7 billion gross and
35.3 billion net, went up again. The largest
issue by volume was a five-year floating-ratebond amounting to 31.5 billion launched by
the state of Lower Saxony, which had alreadyissued two bonds of comparable size andidentical terms of issue in 2001. State govern-ment repaid bank loans amounting to 33.1
billion on balance, with short-term cash ad-vances alone being reduced by 32.7 billion.

9Federal government borrowing
In June central government drew 311.9 bil-
lion gross on the capital market, 37.7 billion
of which was earmarked for redemptions.Furthermore, it repaid 33.3 billion in the
money market; at the end of the month itsvolume of outstanding loans amounted to34.5 billion. Central government debt conse-
quently expanded by 30.9 billion on balance.
The most significant single item of gross bor-rowing was the new issue of Schätze, whichraised 36.2 billion (including 30.1 billion for
the “German Unity” Fund but excludingother transactions). Compared with the issuein March, the coupon was cut back by
14per-
centage point to 4%. By contrast, the issuelaunched in 2000, which was redeemed inJune, had carried an interest rate of 5%.The outstanding amount of these securitiesincreased on balance by 31.6 billion. The
monthly issue of Bubills, which was not offsetby any redemptions, came to 34.8 billion. The
average yield was marginally higher than inMay.
In the first half of 2002 as a whole, central
government’s new market borrowing amount-ed to 315.7 billion. The budgetary plan for
2002 envisages net borrowing of 321 billion
for the whole year. The fact that three-quarters of this sum had already been drawnat the half-way stage does not necessarilyimply that the amount budgeted for the fullyear will be exceeded.
The issuance of Federal bonds (Bunds) was
again the principal instrument of new bor-rowing in the first half of the year, yielding314.8 billion net. A noticeable financial con-
tribution was also made by two-year Schätze,the outstanding amount of which went up by36.8 billion to 366.4 billion, thus recording
– relatively speaking – the steepest rise of alltypes of debt. Five-year special Federal bonds(Bobls), which after Bunds form the second“broadest” channel of central governmentborrowing, yielded 33.2 billion net in view
of increasing issuance volumes. The outstand-ing amount of Bubills remained almost un-changed. The increase in circulation fromabout 320 billion to around 330 billion im-
plied by the change in the issue pattern willonly manifest itself in the third quarter. In-debtedness in the form of Federal Savingsbonds was further reduced by 35.8 billion to
now only 320.6 billion. The repayment of

10notes was likewise refinanced almost exclu-
sively using other types of debt. Bank loanswere reduced by 34.2 billion in total. Cen-
tral government money market indebtednesswent up marginally compared with the levelrecorded at the end of 2001.
With regard to the financing terms for new
issues, central government met with, on aver-age, more favourable conditions in the firsthalf of 2002 compared with the last sixmonths of 2001 for securities of less than oneyear. By contrast, for both two-year and five-year securities the average issue yield was sig-nificantly higher. There were no noticeablechanges in the ten-year segment.
Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity in the German bond market
continued to be buoyant in May. Domesticborrowers issued bonds to a market value of373.2 billion, compared with 374.0 billion in
the previous month. Net of redemptions andafter taking due account of changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds, net salesincreased slightly to 316.9 billion from 315.5
billion in April. After plummeting to 34.3 bil-
lion in the previous month, sales of foreignbonds in Germany again reached a relativelyhigh level ( 311.0 billion). As previously, most
of these bonds were denominated in euro. At327.9 billion, the amount raised from sales of
domestic and foreign bonds in May wassome 50% up on the previous month ( 319.8
bilion).Credit institutions, which enlarged their in-
debtedness in the bond market by 38.4 bil-
lion in May, recorded sharp increases inissues. In April, the comparable figure wasonly 33.9 billion. Half of the net sales accrued
to other bank bonds ( 34.2 billion), followed
by public Pfandbriefe ( 32.3 billion) and secur-
ities issued by specialised credit institutions(31.8 billion). In May, 32.5 billion worth of
corporate bonds were sold, a modest declinefrom the high level in April ( 33.0 billion).
At36.0 billion, net sales by public sector bor-
rowers were down on the previous month(38.6 billion). The Federal Government raised
33.4 billion net from sales of its own debt
securities and sold 34.9 billion net worth of
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) by a tenderprocedure. The Federal Government also sold30.6 billion net worth of two-year Federal
Treasury notes (Schätze) and 30.2 billion net
worth of ten-year Federal bonds. The out-standing amount of five-year special Federalbonds (Bobls), however, declined by 30.2 bil-
lion, and that of Federal savings bonds by30.7 billion.
1In addition, 32.4 billion worth
of a bond issued by the ERP special fund wasredeemed. In May, the Land governments’ in-
debtedness in the bond market increasedmore sharply (by 35.2 billion) than in April
(33.9 billion).
In May credit institutions predominated on
the buyers’ side of the German bond market,

11increasing their bond portfolios by 312.4 bil-
lion. Some two-thirds of this amount consist-ed of domestic paper, mainly public sectorbonds. Most of the 39.1 billion invested by
domestic non-banks in bonds was channelledto paper issued by non-residents ( 36.3 bil-
lion). Foreign investors purchased domesticbonds worth 36.4 billion, favouring paper is-
sued by private sector issuers ( 35.3 billion).
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
remained subdued in May. Domestic enter-prises placed new shares to a market value of30.9 billion (April: 31.0 billion). Demand for
foreign equities strengthened, however. At35.7 billion, sales of foreign shares were well
up on the previous month ( 31.8 billion). On
balance, 36.6 billion net worth of domestic
and foreign paper was sold in the Germanequity market.
In May equities were bought mainly by for-
eign investors; they invested 310.9 billion
worth in German equities, most of whichconsisted of portfolio investments ( 39.2 bil-
lion). Domestic non-banks raised 34.3 billion
net from the sale of equities. This was primar-ily the result of portfolio shifts from domesticsecurities (- 310.7 billion) to foreign securities
(36.3 billion). The reverse pattern could be
observed in the case of credit institutions,which sold foreign equities (- 30.7 billion) and
purchased German equities ( 30.8 billion).Investment fund certificates
In May domestic investment funds recorded
inflows of 35.3 billion. Funds open to the
general public ( 32.9 billion) and specialised
funds ( 32.5 billion) benefited to a similarly ex-
tent. Of the funds open to the general public,share-based funds, which raised 31.2 billion
of new capital, led the field. Open-end realestate funds and mixed funds sold certificatesworth 30.8 billion and 30.6 billion respective-
ly. Foreign investment fund companies sold31.9 billion worth of share certificates. The
total amount raised by sales of domestic andforeign investment fund certificates thuscame to 37.2 billion.
As in the previous months, investment fund
certificates were purchased primarily by do-Sales and purchases of bonds

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a surplus of34.3 billion in May 2002, an improvement of
around 30.3 billion over the previous month.
Contributing factors were a higher foreigntrade surplus and a smaller deficit in invisiblecurrent transactions.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, there was a surplus of 39.6 bil-
lion on trade in goods in May, compared withone of 39.4 billion in April. Even after elimin-
ating seasonal and working-day variations,the trade surplus improved in May ( 39.9 bil-
lion, following 39.2 billion in the previous
month). The overall improvement in trade,though, is attributable to the fact that thedecline in imports of goods in May, at 7
12%
compared with the previous month, was evensharper than that of exports of goods (5%).The unusually large number of days taken offto create long weekends in May 2002, whichis not included in the adjustment for working-day variations of the foreign trade statistics, aswell as strikes in some sectors of industry mayhave contributed to the decline. If the lastthree months (March to May) are taken to-gether, exports (adjusted for seasonal andworking-day variations) remained unchangedfrom the previous three-month period (De-
cember to February), whereas imports pickedup by just over 1%.
The other current transactions with non-resi-
dents closed at a deficit in May which, at34.9 billion, was slightly lower than in April
(35.1 billion). Lower net expenditure on
cross-border services ( 31.7 billion, compared
with 32.7 billion in April) was the main rea-
son. Current transfers to non-residents alsodecreased on balance by 30.4 billion to 32.4
billion. At the same time, however, factor in-come, which has traditionally fluctuated fairlysharply from month to month, saw net ex-penditure of 30.8 billion following a surplus
of30.4 billion in April.
In capital transactions with non-residents,
cross-border portfolio transactions under-went a turnaround in May. Net outflows offunds ( 310.7 billion) in April were followed in
May by net capital imports of 32.7 billion.
This was caused chiefly by reawakened inter-est on the part of foreign investors in Germansecurities ( 316.0 billion, following - 34.8 bil-
lion in April). Their main focus was dividedbetween shares ( 39.2 billion) and – for the
first time this year – domestic money marketpaper ( 34.9 billion), whereas they invested
less heavily in bonds and notes and in invest-ment fund certificates. However, German in-vestors, too, purchased more foreign paper(313.3 billion, compared with 35.8 billion in
the previous month). In the face of risinguncertainty in international stock markets,it was once again euro-denominated fixed-interest paper which encountered briskdemand from residents during the monthPurchases of

13under review ( 310.3 billion). However, they
stepped up their holdings of shares, invest-ment fund certificates and foreign-currency-denominated bonds only slightly, whereas re-demptions and sales of money market paperby residents even outweighed purchases ofsuch paper, on balance.
Direct investment, too, resulted in net capital
imports ( 316.4 billion), in a continuation of
the pattern of the preceding months. Foreignenterprises increased their investment in theGerman economy by 312.4 billion, both by
raising their equity capital ( 35.9 billion) and
by granting loans to their domestic subsidiar-ies (36.9 billion). Further capital imports were
recorded in May from intra-group credittransactions between German investors andtheir affiliated companies abroad; on balance,they outstripped outflows to other invest-ment vehicles and to the acquisition of par-ticipating interests abroad by German firmsby33.9 billion.
Unsecuritised credit transactions by non-
banks closed the reporting month with out-flows of funds. Domestic enterprises and indi-viduals exported 33.1 billion, on balance,
whereas the transactions of general govern-ment led to a slight net capital import of 30.3
billion.
The (unsecuritised) net external assets of the
entire banking system (excluding the Bundes-bank’s foreign reserves) increased by 320.4
billion, a reflection, as it were, of all remain-ing cross-border payments. The key factorwas the increase in domestic credit institu-tions’ short-term external position ( 322.8 bil-Major items of the balance

15Consumer prices
and the changeoverfrom Deutsche Markto euroNow that just over six months have
passed since the introduction of eurobanknotes and coins on 1 January 2002,this article looks once again at theeuro’s impact on prices, taking the offi-cial price statistics as a basis. In thisconnection, a special study of 35 select-ed goods and services provides deeperinsights. For instance, prices werechanged in significantly more cases inJanuary 2002 than is normally the casein any single month. Despite this fact,price adjustments were fewer thanmight have been expected in the eventof a one-step changeover to “attract-ive” euro prices. Instead, in January2002, just over two-thirds of the 18,000or so prices reported for the selectedgoods were converted exactly from theDecember Deutsche Mark prices to thenew euro prices. This finding is consist-ent with the conclusion, derived fromthe official price index as a whole, thatthe changeover from D-Mark to eurodid not play a major role in pushing upprices. Even so, there were a numberof exceptional price changes whichhad an impact on the inflation “per-ceived” by many consumers. Neverthe-less, this may have been influenced bythe fact that there had already been amarked rise in the prices of food, in-dustrial goods and services last year – arise that can hardly be attributed tothe introduction of euro banknotesand coins.

16Determinants of pricing behaviour
On 1 January 2002, the Deutsche Mark was
replaced by the euro as sole legal tender inGermany. This date was known a long timebeforehand, as was the conversion factorof 1.95583 to be applied when convertingD-Mark amounts into euro. Market partici-pants were consequently able to take due ac-count of this and make their plans well in ad-vance. As far as households are concerned,the impending changeover may have led, forexample, to purchases being brought for-ward – because of uncertainty as to whethersuppliers would use the introduction of eurocash to raise prices. There is, admittedly, noprecise information available on this, butthere were complaints in the retail trade dur-ing the first few months of this year aboutconsumers cutting down on their purchases.This may indicate that there was still consider-able uncertainty about the extent to which anewly displayed price was to be regarded asreasonable or excessive.
Faced with the introduction of euro bank-
notes and coins, various strategies were avail-able to the suppliers. First, making pricechanges prior to the changeover may havebeen advisable to avoid placing an additionalstrain on the exchange of payment mediaand to position themselves advantageouslyfor the start for the euro era. Second, giventhe fact that the conversion ratio was not 1:1and would necessarily result in a “new look”for prices, the cash changeover is likely tohave been regarded as a suitable occasion toadjust prices. This approach would also savecosts that inevitably arise when new pricesGoods and services of the consumer

17are introduced. Finally, one conceivable op-
tion was to take account of heightenedwatchfulness and awareness accompanyingthe currency changeover and wait for a whilebefore implementing scheduled price changes.
The following is an attempt to gain a deeper
insight into suppliers’ pricing behaviour.
1This
study is also based on special analyses of theprice statistics which are being conducted bythe Federal Statistical Office
2and the Bun-
desbank. These cover the price reports for35 separate items taken from the Germanconsumer price index. These make up around8% of the overall basket of goods. This selec-tion consists of goods and services in dailyuse together with representative items fromthe food, drinks and tobacco industry as wellas the industrial goods and services sectors(see the list on page 16). Another major con-sideration in selecting these items was theavailability of price information which is ascomprehensive and widespread as possible.In total, more than 18,000 individual priceseries were analysed. Taken together, thesecases form the basis of the analysis. No quali-fications are made with regard to individualproducts, their relative importance in terms ofconsumption or their respective degree ofrepresentation.

In terms of price formation at the consumerlevel, “attractive” prices in the shape of“threshold” or “rounded” prices are a majorfactor. A price is described as “threshold”when it ends with the digit 9. Examples ofthis, for lower prices, are DM1.49 or 31.89
and, for higher amounts, DM59 or 3499.
Owing to their psychological impact, suchprices are regarded as “attractive” in the
sense of boosting sales. A “rounded” pricehas a 0 or a 5 as its last digit, eg DM1.60 or325. The major consideration here is making
it easier to pay bills or give change.
The prime importance of attractive prices is
confirmed by the special analysis. At the startof 2001, ie a date well before (and, it maybe assumed, largely uninfluenced by) thechangeover, only some 15% of all pricesShares

18charged were for an “uneven” amount. The
overwhelming majority were attractive prices.Threshold prices are especially common in thecase of goods with a comparatively low prod-uct value. More than four-fifths of all record-ed individual prices in this segment endedin 9. The higher the prices of goods and ser-vices, the more prominent “even” prices be-come. In the upper price groups, their shareincreases to around one-third. In the highestprice group, certain uneven prices also be-come more widespread, displacing mainlythreshold prices and attaining a share ofaround 30%.
Prices and price developments in 2001
Prices as they appeared in early 2001 re-
mained virtually unchanged almost through-out the year. It was only towards the end ofthe year that price adjustments became morefrequent, with a move away from attractiveDM prices towards uneven DM prices. Evenso, in December 2001, less than one-fifth ofall reported prices were in the “uneven price”category. This indicates that the changeoverto the euro and the desire to maintain the ap-pearance of attractive prices in the new cur-rency were probably not yet major factors interms of price-setting, even though it wascommon practice for prices to be displayed inboth D-Mark and euro. Instead, the majorconsideration in effecting price changes con-tinued to be an interest in psychologically“favourable” (even) DM prices.
Modified pricing was, however, already ob-
servable in the clothing sector in 2001. Amarked increase in atypical pricing was ascer-
tainable in the case of men’s socks, ladies’pullovers, tights and shoes, all of which areincluded in the special analysis. Except forwomen’s outer wear, this led to a sharp in-crease in prices. Between January and De-cember 2001, the average increase amount-ed to more than 2
12%. Last year also saw a
significant rise in the prices of other industrialgoods. Averaged across all industrial sectorproducts included in the consumer priceindex, this gives a year-on-year price increaseof 1.2% in December 2001. This was distinct-ly more than one year before, when the in-crease had been less than one-third as much.The deterioration in the price climate is likelyto have been due not only to the euro’sweakness on the foreign exchange marketsbut also to the sharp rise in oil prices in 1999and 2000, which made this major source ofenergy and raw material persistently more ex-pensive worldwide.
With a year-on-year rise of 2.8% in Decem-
ber 2001, the prices of services as a wholerose much more sharply than those of indus-trial goods. In this case, too, the rate of priceincrease was noticeably higher than in 2000.To a large extent, this was due to administra-tive measures. There was a dramatic increasein motor vehicle tax for ecologically “un-friendly” older vehicles, for example. At thesame time, radio and television licence feeswere raised significantly. Even excluding thesespecial influences, however, the year-on-yearrate shows a price increase of 1.6%.

19prices in 2001. First, unfavourable weather in
the first few months of last year led to supplyshortages that pushed up prices. This was fol-lowed in spring by a BSE and foot-and-mouthdisease crisis, which had a massive impact onprices. Second, there had been a fierce com-petitive struggle among major supermarketchains in 1999 and 2000, accompanied bymarked reductions in prices, after which aprocess of consolidation set in. This was con-nected with an official warning issued to indi-vidual suppliers by the Federal Cartel Officeconcerning the practice of selling goodsbelow cost price. As the market situation be-came calmer again, prices were adjusted andtrading margins improved. According to theofficial consumer price index, food cost 5.3%more overall in December 2001 than oneyear before.
If the three categories of food, industrial
goods and services are taken together, amarked rise in prices is apparent for last year.At 2.4%, the year-on-year rate at the end of2001 was around two-and-a-half times high-er than at the end of 2000. These marked ad-justments may have simultaneously createdscope for lowering selling prices again inorder to arrive at attractive prices followingthe changeover to the euro, which – in linewith the conversion rate – led to unevenprices in many cases. The fact that the end-of-year rate of consumer price increase, at1.7%, was lower overall was mostly due toenergy sources, which were 2.5% less expen-sive in December 2001 than 12 months previ-ously. Rents, too, had a price-dampening im-pact insofar as their rise, at 1.3%, matchedthe rate in the comparable month of 2000.From the Deutsche Mark to the euro
At the turn of 2001-02, the replacement of
the Deutsche Mark meant that attention wasfocused on what prices looked like in euro. Inline with the official conversion factor of 31=
DM1.95583, a previously attractive DM pricegenerally turned out to be an uneven figurein euro. The special study involving the 35 se-lected goods and services shows that some-Change from previous year, quarterly

20what more than two-thirds of the roughly
18,000 individual prices were convertedexactly. The share of uneven prices thus morethan doubled and, at over 50%, became themost prominently featured type of price ondisplay. Even more numerous were exactconversions in the case of, say, washingmachines, coffee machines or wine, whereshares of around 90% were achieved. Cin-ema tickets, hairdressing services and the costof an overnight stay in a hotel were wellbelow the average, with the percentage ofprecise conversions ranging from less thanone-third to just under 50%.
Even though prices in January were converted
exactly in the majority of cases, the numberof price changes in that month was far higherthan usual. Whereas, on average, less than10% of the prices covered by the special an-alysis were changed each month in 2001, thenumber was three times as high at the startof the year. Smaller adjustments to a nearlyequivalent attractive euro price were alsoquite frequent. In other cases, however, sup-pliers evidently attempted to exploit the re-duced transparency in the changeover periodto effect quite sharp price increases. Just overhalf of all price changes were upward. Notquite so many were downward adjustments.
The statement, derived from the special an-
alysis, that the euro had no more than a mod-erate impact on inflation fits well with thepicture presented by the overall data of theconsumer price index. The officially recorded0.9% month-on-month price increase inJanuary 2002 and the jump in the annual ratefrom 1.7% in December to 2.1% at the startof 2002 indicate a considerable surge in
prices. Even so, on the whole, no major infla-tionary impact can be ascribed to the change-over from D-Mark to euro at the turn of2001-02. This is because there were a num-ber of extraordinary influences in January2002 which also have to be taken into con-sideration and which have no causal relation-ship with the cash changeover.
In the case of food, the onset of exceptionally
cold winter weather led to dramatic pricerises, especially for supplies of seasonal fruitand vegetables. These increases were all themore marked because harvests in the Medi-terranean countries, which supply a largepart of the domestic market in the wintermonths, were also affected by failures. If sea-sonal products are excluded, food priceswent up 0.3% month on month in January.Although this was more than on a multi-yearaverage, it would hardly be appropriate tospeak of a price surge on a broad front.
With the exception of tobacco, for which
taxes were increased, price developments inthe case of industrial goods were quite sub-dued. A month-on-month rise of no morethan one-tenth indicates that prices were ad-justed by far smaller amounts in January thanin the second half of 2001. The year-on-yearrate, too, increased only slightly from 1.2% inDecember 2001 to 1.3% in January 2002.Apart from electricity and petrol, for whichthe third stage of the ecology taxes came intoforce, energy sources (which also include gasand central/district heating) became less ex-pensive.

21sumer price index, ie around 12% of the en-
tire basket of goods, the increase in the gen-eral price level between December 2001 andJanuary 2002 falls to 0.3%.
Even that price increase cannot simply be re-
garded as being attributable to the euro,however. Rather, a factor to be taken intoconsideration is that, in quite an appreciablenumber of cases, price adjustments are trad-itionally made at the start of the year – oneexample of this being housing rents, whichare usually adjusted only at fairly long inter-vals. Federal Statistical Office data indicatesnumerous rent adjustments for January ofthis year, too. As a rule, the euro is unlikely tohave been a significant factor in this connec-tion either, since a landlord has to state theamount of rent explicitly and the tenant caneasily check that amount by converting itback. Excluding the rent component and theabove-mentioned special factors, the month-on-month rise in the consumer price indexfalls to 0.2%. “Normal” price adjustmentsare likely to have been made in the case ofother goods and services, too. Moreover, inmany cases, price adjustments that had beenplanned for some while may have been timedto coincide with the introduction of the euroin order to keep repricing costs as low as pos-sible. The cited 0.2% thus marks, if anything,the upper limit of the euro’s influence.
Nevertheless, in some areas the introduction
of the euro was used to effect specific priceincreases. One factor in the suppliers’ calcula-tions may have been that a changeover to acompletely new “look” for prices makes it iseasier to push through price increases sincethere is no immediate possibility of making a
comparison with the old D-Mark prices. Thesector most heavily affected was services,where prices were put up sharply. This wasthe case, in particular, in the hotel, restaurantand catering trade, for hairdressing andmotor vehicle maintenance services as well asfor repairs of electrical appliances and for avisit to the cinema.
Perceived inflation
This price-setting behaviour as well as the in-
crease in the rate of inflation caused by high-er taxes and the extremely cold and wet win-ter may have played a part in creating thegeneral public’s frequent impression that theintroduction of the euro had been accompan-ied by a broad wave of price rises.
A major cause of dissatisfaction is likely to be
the increase in the general level of prices in2001. This is all the more the case as the de-bate on inflation generally focuses on theyear-on-year rates which cover price develop-ments over the preceding 12 months. It isopen to question whether the remembered“old” DM prices, which are used for compari-son with euro prices and which determine“perceived” inflation, always took full ac-count of the previous year’s upward move-ment in prices. In the case of food, in particu-lar, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease resultedin marked shifts in the overall level of prices.Additionally, fairly frequent tax increases,which – given their regular occurrence – arenot readily identifiable in the year-on-yearanalysis, undoubtedly have an effect on how

22prices are perceived. Moreover, price changes
in products which are paid for in cash featuremore prominently in consumers’ perceptionsthan when amounts are debited from a bankaccount. Finally, it should be noted thatconverting euro prices into D-Mark (whichpeople need to do if they want to compareold and new prices) using the rule of thumb31 = DM2 overstates inflation by around
2
14%. In summary, it may be stated that, al-
though prices at the consumer level did showa marked rise in 2001 and at the turn of theyear, this upward movement was not due pri-marily to the euro but to other factors.
Price developments since early spring 2002
have been quite moderate. In seasonally ad-justed terms, the consumer price index in June(more recent data are unavailable at present)was no higher than it had been in March. Dur-ing the same period, the year-on-year rate ofprice increase fell from 1.8% to 0.8%. Foodand industrial goods played the major part increating a calmer price climate, with pricesfalling in both cases. (Taken together, thesemake up nearly half of total consumption ex-penditure.) This decline slightly more than off-set the persistent price rises not only in ser-vices, in particular, but also in housing rents.At the end of the period under review, energyprices generally stabilised at a high level.
As the special study shows, the recent aim
has again been to offer attractive prices forindividual items. This mostly involves smallprice changes. The distribution of prices forindividual products and services shows an in-creasing tendency towards concentration ona small number of price key points. A goodShares 1Distribution of sugar prices

23example of this is sugar, the pricing of which
is shown in the chart on page 22. A concen-tration of prices at DM1.79 per kilo is clearlyidentifiable for 2001. By October, this pricepoint had, in fact, become even more prom-inent because of a dramatic fall in the num-ber of price reports at DM1.69 as individualsuppliers had raised the price of sugar byDM0.10. In January, the distribution of pricesshows two peaks in connection with the con-version into euro. The prices 30.89 and 30.92
are almost equally well represented. The lat-ter corresponds to an exact conversion, whilethe former signifies a slight price reduction. InMay, there is a discernible trend towards anew key price point of 30.89 at the expense
of an exact conversion. So far, the price ofDM1.99, which used to mark the upper pricesegment before the introduction of the euro,has largely retained its importance whenexact conversions are made.
The overall picture presented by prices tended
to become rather diffuse immediately follow-ing the euro changeover – and thus probablyalso contributed to consumers’ reluctance tobuy – but has now gradually taken on a clear-er shape. The example of tickets for admis-sion to the cinema is one way of illustratingthis. In 2001, a distinct concentration on“rounded” amounts at key price points ofDM11 and DM12 can be identified. By con-trast, in January 2002, a large number ofintermediate prices appear. By May, however,the situation becomes noticeably cleareragain. The “uneven” prices disappear andgive way to “rounded” prices. A new keyprice point for a ticket forms at 36, surround-

DM11 and DM12 would correspond to 35.62
and36.14, respectively. The present 36 there-
fore indicates a distinct price increase.
Overall, however, the impression gained from
the special analysis is that the share of thresh-old prices has so far been much smaller thanin the D-Mark era. “Rounded” prices, how-ever, have gained in importance. The possibil-ity that these are being used more often with
the euro than they used to be with theD-Mark cannot, it seems, be ruled out. In thecase of more expensive goods and services,uneven prices are, so far, significantly morestrongly represented than before the currencychangeover. It would be premature, however,to regard this as evidence of a fundamentalchange in price-setting behaviour.

25Funded old-age
provision and thefinancial marketsThe pay-as-you-go pension insurance
scheme in Germany is faced with inevit-able demographic challenges. In orderto curb the rise in contribution rates, re-strictions on benefits were unavoidable.Supplementary private pension planshave therefore become all the more ofa priority. The recent pension reform,which initiated a fundamental changein this direction, has also created con-siderable financial incentives for build-ing up private old-age provision. Theassociated gradual increase in thefunded component of pension finan-cing will potentially contribute to amore equal intergenerational burdensharing and also to a more broadlybased funding of old-age provision thatwill increase security and reliability.
This kind of pension reform may also
have an impact on the capital market.Additional national savings as well asreform-induced structural changes arepossible in this market. This will be in-fluenced not only by the increasing in-stitutionalisation of the financial mar-kets, in particular, but also by the typic-ally longer-term investment of savingsfor the purpose of funded pension pro-vision.
Financial markets and old-age provision
in an ageing society
In the ongoing debate on old-age provision, it
is now widely accepted that there needs to

Deutsche
Bundesbank
Monthly Report

26be a shift of emphasis away from the pay-as-
you-go system towards funded old-age provi-sion. Considering the pension claims accumu-lated under the pay-as-you-go system andthe associated problem of making a change-over, no “economic added value” may be ex-pected as a result of changes in financingalone.
1Instead, attention has been focused
on achieving more reliable old-age provisionby means of a broader risk diversification aswell as the prospect of a more even distribu-tion of burdens between the various age co-horts. Last but not least, non-wage labourcosts will also be reduced.
In this context, the implications that a strong-
er reliance on capital funding will have for thefinancial markets are attracting ever greaterinterest. It is possible to ask about both its in-fluence on national savings and the structuralchanges in the financial markets. The latterconcerns the financial service providers aswell as their products. Experience in othercountries indicates that a stronger reliance onfunded old-age provision leads to a greaterinstitutionalisation of capital investments, forexample, in the form of pension funds. Withregard to the products, provision for retire-ment differs from other saving motives mainlyon account of its long-term nature. This, too,is also likely to have an effect on how theplayers behave in the financial markets.

way as an improved allocation of capital to itsmost productive uses – could enhance theoutlook for growth in the overall economy.For that reason, this article deals initially withthose main aspects of the recent pension re-form which are relevant to the capital market.
Their anticipated effects on the financial mar-kets will then be discussed in more detail.
Greater emphasis on funded private
pension provision
The pension reform adopted in 2001 com-
prises two key elements. Firstly, the level ofbenefits under the statutory pension insur-ance scheme was significantly reduced bymodifying the adjustment formula in order tocurb the rise in contributions. Secondly, con-siderable financial incentives were created toencourage private (individual and company-based) old-age provision.
Mainly in the eight years between 2003 and
2010, the annual pension adjustment will bereduced by just over 0.6 percentage point peryear as a result of the reform. The grossbenchmark pension level
2in 2030 is likely to
be some 3 percentage points lower (ataround 42
12%) than it would have been
without the reform. The difference whencompared with the present figure of around48% is larger, in fact, because, even withoutthe reform, the gross benchmark pensionlevel would still have been reduced owing tothe “automatic brake” mechanism

27the old net-pay-based pension adjustment
formula.
Parliament has linked the promotion of sup-
plementary old-age provision using grantsand tax incentives (“Riester pension”), pursu-ant to the Retirement Pension Act (Altersver-
mögensgesetz), with the promotional criteria
laid down in the Certification of the Retire-ment Pension Contracts Act (Altersvor-
sorgeverträge-Zertifizierungsgesetz), through
which an extensive and quite complex regula-tion of private provision has been established(see the box on p 28). This principally con-cerns the terms of the contracts but also thechoice of prospective supplier. At the sametime the underlying conditions of company-based old-age provision have also been ex-tended as a result of the right to claim a directinsurance plan – under which part of anemployee’s gross pay is deducted by theemployer and paid directly into a private pen-sion plan – and the introduction of definedcontribution plans.
4
The promotion of private pension plans isbeing introduced in four stages, beginning in2002 and ending in 2008. This concerns boththe amount of non-income-related grant
5
and the maximum amounts for tax-deductible contributions to private pensionplans
6pursuant to section 10a of the Income
Tax Act. The tax office examines which ismore advantageous in an individual case: thenon-income-related grant or the tax incen-tive. The lower the income – and consequent-ly the lower the marginal income-tax rate –and the higher the number of children, themore advantageous the grant option be-comes. Owing to the progressive tax scale,
tax-deductible contributions become morefavourable as income increases. Governmentpromotion thus has a u-shaped profile in rela-tion to income, with government promotionbeing comparatively least generous for aver-age incomes (see the chart on p 29).
The tax incentives for company-based pen-
sion plans are even more attractive. In par-ticular, from this year onwards there is thepossibility of investing up to 4% of the max-imum level of earnings subject to contribu-tions to the statutory pension insurancescheme (2002: 32,160 per month) free of tax
and social security contributions
7in a pension
fund or as part of a direct insurance plan. Thismeans that company pension schemes willhave a significant advantage, particularly upto 2008, over private pension plans.
It is also possible to combine the assistance
options of private pension plans, pursuant tosection 10a of the Income Tax Act, with thoseof company pension schemes. Since the max-imum level of earnings subject to contribu-tions to the statutory pension insurancescheme is 1.9 times average earnings, anaverage earner, under the tax incentivescould save around 7
12% of his gross salary by
making full use of the assistance available

schemes in Germany, Monthly Report, March 2001,

5The basic grant increases from 338 to 3154 and the
grant per child from 346 to 3185 per year.
6The ceiling goes up from 3525 in 2002 to 32,100 as
from 2008. At present, 32,100 is the equivalent of just
under 4% of the maximum level of earnings subject to
contributions to the statutory pension insurance scheme
amounting to 354,000 per year.

28Requirements of government-assisted old-age provision
under “The Retirement Pension Act” (Altersvermögensgesetz)
The Retirement Pension Act has laid down a series
of requirements for assisted old-age provision in-struments.
1. Ongoing voluntary contributions are to be paid
during the savings phase.
2. The benefit phase will not commence before
the age of 60 (earlier only as a disability pensionin conjunction with a statutory pension owingto a reduced ability to work).
3. At the commencement of the payout phase, at
least the amounts paid in must be available(nominal value guarantee). Up to 15% of con-tributions may be reserved for insurance againstinability to work; however, the nominal valueguarantee does not apply in this case.
4. The payout must be in the form of a life-time
(at least fixed-level) annuity or in the form of apayout scheme with lifelong part annuitisation.
5. In the case of a fixed payout scheme, the, at
least, fixed-level pensions are permitted for amaximum period until the age of 85. These maybe split into guaranteed and variable reimbur-sement elements. Full annuitisation must takeplace at the age of 85 at the latest. The, at least,fixed-level pension may not, in turn, be lowerthan the previously guaranteed pension compo-nent.
6. The contracts may also include a surviving de-
pendants’ insurance.
7. Contributions and proceeds (including capital
gains) may be invested only in
– pension insurance and capitalisation pro-
ducts pursuant to section 1 (4) (2) of the Acton the Supervision of Insurance Enterprises,
– interest-yielding bank deposits or– mutual funds shares.Shares in foreign funds must comply with Coun-
cil Directive 85/611/EEC of 20 December 1985(collective investment regulations, particularemphasis on the transferability of securities).
8. Contract and marketing costs are to be spread
equally over ten years or defined as a specificshare of the contributions.
9. The supplier is obliged to provide information
(annually and in writing) on how the contribu-tions are used, the capital that has accumulated
so far, the retained pro rata contract and mar-keting costs, administrative costs and the earn-ings gained.
10. There must be a right to suspend or terminate
the contract at a three-month period of noticefrom the end of each quarter and to transferthe accumulated capital to a new contract.
11. There must be no possibility of an assignment
or transfer of claims or rights of ownership aris-ing from the contract to a third party.
Under the “interim withdrawal model” an amount
between a minimum of 510,000 and a maximum of
550,000 may be withdrawn from the old-age provi-
sion assets that have been saved, and used – in themanner of an interest-free loan – to finance owner-occupied property. Repayment is made in equalmonthly instalments and the amount must be fullyrepaid by the age of 65. If the property owner is inarrears with remaining instalments, the assistanceamounts contained in the unpaid portion of thewithdrawal amount are to be paid back. The sameapplies if the property ceases to be owner-occupied. The repayment obligation can be avoidedonly if another property is purchased within oneyear or the outstanding loan is fully redeemed.
Finally, existing pension contracts can also be
adapted to conform with the above criteria andqualify for assistance.
Any of the following institutions may supply a pen-
sion contract.
– Life insurance companies, credit institutions
and investment companies domiciled in Ger-many.
– Life insurance companies (92/96/EEC) and credit
institutions (89/646/EEC) domiciled in anothercountry of the European Economic Area, andmanagement and investment companies withinthe meaning of the Council Directive 85/611/EEC.
– German branch offices of life insurance compa-
nies or credit institutions domiciled outside ofthe European Economic Area but which are al-lowed to conduct deposit business in Germany.
In order to ensure subsequent taxation, benefits
must be paid out to tax payers resident in Germany.

of the earnings ceiling subject to contribu-tions). In addition, in 2008, an average earnercould pay around 3
14% of the maximum
level of earnings subject to contributions8–
which is the equivalent of around 614%o f
average income – into a supplementary pri-vate pension plan. If the average earnerswere to take full advantage of both these op-tions, in 2008 he/she could use 13

tax-subsidised income for his/her own pen-sion provision.

p 30).
According to the estimates of the Federal
Government, the assistance measures for pri-vate old-age provision are likely to result intax shortfalls of around 312
12billion from
2009 onwards.9Additionally, there will also
be temporary shortfalls in contributions tothe social security funds. The exact amountwill depend on how many contributionpayers opt for direct insurance plans in theircompany pensions. If every employee out ofa total of around 35 million contributed 4%of his/her income, this would lead to a short-%

30Pension benefits gap as a result of the 2001 pension reform
The 2001 pension reform not only reduced the
level of benefits under the pay-as-you-go statu-
tory pension insurance scheme but also intro-
duced financial incentives for building up a pri-
vate pension. This box discusses what supple-
mentary pension contribution is necessary to
bridge the gap opened up by the recent pension
reform. It should be borne in mind that the
younger the person is, the bigger the gap is
which needs to be covered. However, the older
the person is, ie the closer he/she is to retirement
age, the less time there is remaining to close the
gap.
The pension benefits gap can be measured by
the development of the gross benchmark pen-
sion level. Without the pension reform the cur-
rent pension level of 48% would have fallen to
approximately just under 46% by 2030. This is
mainly attributable to the assumption of a rise
in the pension insurance contribution rate and
an increasing wage tax ratio, which was still a
factor in the old pension adjustment formula.
Under these conditions the pensions would have
followed net wages and salaries which increase
more slowly than gross wages and salaries. With
the pension reform the level of benefits falls to
approximately 4112% and is thus around 3 per-
centage points lower over the long term than
would have been the case without the reform.
This is due, in particular, to the fact that fictional
contributions to old-age provision are taken
into account in the new pension adjustment for-
mula. Therefore, over the next eight years the
pension increase will be just over 0.6 percentage
point lower annually.
This raises the question as to what annual contri-
bution (as a percentage of gross wages and sal-
aries) will have to be saved in order to close the
gap opened up by the pension reform. Alterna-
tively it could be asked what savings contribu-
tion will be necessary to maintain the current
pension level (status quo) in the future. Even
without the pension reform there would also
have been a supplementary requirement for
provision but this would have been lower than
with the reform. Below, results will be presented
from both points of view.
The calculations are based on a “model” insured
person who at the age of 20 takes on a job
which is subject to compulsory insurance (or is
credited during non-contributory periods, for
example, because of training), retires without
deductions at 65 and draws a pension for a
further 18 years. 3.0% has been assumed as the
real return of a private pension. Real gross
wages and salaries increase by 1.5% per year.
Under these conditions, a 20-year old todayhas to save just under 1% of his gross pay in or-
der to draw (when he retires in 2047) a pension
combining private and state elements which
would have been offered by the statutory pen-
sion system alone without the reform. In order
to maintain the current gross pension level, a
higher annual private contribution of just under
112% would be required whereas just over12%
would have been sufficient without the reform.
However, those people who are closer to retire-
ment age would have to save significantly more.
For them the compound interest can no longer
have a significant effect. A 50-year old today, for
example, would have to save just over 212% ex-
tra in order to avoid a loss as a result of the pen-
sion reform, or just over 4% in order to maintain
the present pension level. A private supplemen-
tary pension plan amounting to 4% of gross
wages and salaries would therefore be appropri-
ate for older contribution payers. By contrast,
younger people paying this percentage would
save more than required to fill the reform-
related pension benefits gap.
The calculations are obviously dependant on as-
sumptions. There would be a smaller pension
provision requirement if the pension were
drawn for a shorter period. Conversely, the re-
quired private pension provision increases if a
surviving dependants’ pension also has to be
covered.
Finally, the calculations also depend on the as-
sumptions about interest and wage growth
rates. Therefore the pension provision require-
ment changes with the assumed return of the
private old-age provision. If an interest rate of
4.5% (or 1.5%) is chosen instead of 3% the pen-
sion requirement of the 20-year old would de-
crease (or increase) by 1% to around12% (or
134%).
Finally, it should be noted that the taxation of
the retirement income is not taken into account
when calculating the necessary supplementary
contributions. Given an effective subsequent
taxation of private pensions, a higher savings
contribution would be necessary in order to
achieve a projected net income after retirement.
On the whole, the calculations indicate that at
least for younger insured persons an additional
pension contribution of less than 4% of their in-
come is likely to be sufficient not only to bridge
the gap opened up by the pension reform but
also to maintain the present pension level. These
quantitative relationships should be noted in
the case of assisted private pension provision.

31fall in revenue, at all events, of just over 112
percentage points.
The first stage of government assistance
began this year. Every entitled person receivesa grant of 338 per year when he/she has paid
at least 1% of his/her income subject to com-pulsory insurance (including grant) into a cer-tified pension plan (PPP). The grant increasesby346 per child. Experience has shown that
only very hesitant use is being made of thisoption. This may have been influenced by thebeneficiaries’ limited experience and thecomplexity of the products. Associations ad-vising people to wait for the time being orcalls for changes to the legislation may alsohave played a part in this. Furthermore, thereis still no detailed information on how far thenew options are being implemented in com-pany-based pension plans.
Effects on savings behaviourWhether there will be a change in savings be-
haviour as a result of the reduction in benefitsunder the pay-as-you-go statutory pension in-surance scheme and the promotion of pri-vate-funded old-age provision depends onvarious factors. A lowering of the pensionlevel in the pay-as-you-go system may lead,for example, to an increase in private old-ageprovision. In addition, economic agents maynow realise that they need to pursue alonger-term optimisation strategy for theirold-age provision. Even if the old-age provi-sion becomes more important as a motive forsaving, the volume of savings will not neces-sarily increase overall – either due to a lack ofability to save or because savings investmentsearmarked for other purposes, say for unfore-
seeable events, have been diverted into PPPs.The decline in the private savings ratio in Ger-many in the 1990s does not, at first sight, in-dicate an adjustment reaction to reductionsin the statutory pension insurance scheme. In2001, however, the savings ratio increasedagain somewhat. In addition to tax relief andeconomic uncertainty, this may also havebeen due to the fact that old-age provisionhas recently been attracting increasing atten-tion from those concerned.
The grants and tax incentives introduced by
the Retirement Pension Act result – from anindividual investor’s point of view – in a yieldwhich is higher than that obtained with lesswell assisted or non-assisted forms of invest-ment. This is mainly due to the fact that thecontributions are paid out of tax-free incomeand that the interest income remains tax-freefor the duration of the contract. However,the subsequent pension benefits will betaxed. In contrast to a conventional bank sav-ings plan, however, there remains the advan-tage that interest earned on the investment isfree of tax. On the other hand, in private pen-sion insurance schemes the contributions areusually paid out of taxed income but theinterest during the saving period is also ex-empt from tax. A pension scheme in whichpension benefits are taxed subsequentlydoes, however, have an advantage over thisform of saving if the tax burden after retire-ment is lower than during active working life.However, as a result of extensive regulationthere is likely to be a lower gross yield on in-vestment products eligible for assistance,which puts that advantage into perspective.

32Whether assisted saving results in additional
private savings depends to a great extent onthe interest sensitivity of the potential savers.With a given amount of savings, the highernet yield of provision products eligible for as-sistance will allow a higher level of consump-tion in the future. The fact that this makesconsumption in the present more expensivedoes not necessarily mean that more will ac-tually be saved now. Instead, higher interestrates with an unchanged level of consump-tion in the future might also be used for ahigher level of current consumption. In thatcase, current savings would actually decrease.It is therefore not at all clear what impact animproved yield will have on private savings.This means that its impact on long-term inter-est rates also remains an open question.
Rough estimates of the amount of funds like-
ly to be raised in connection with assistancefor funded old-age provision are based mainlyon the sum of gross wages and salaries inGermany. Therefore, as things stand atpresent, an average 4% rate of saving wouldyield savings of just over 336 billion. However,
households with an income above the max-imum level of earnings subject to contribu-tions are unable to invest the full 4% of theirincome in old-age pension contracts pro-moted by the government.
10On the other
hand, households with a lower income havethe possibility of saving more than 4% oftheir earnings under the new assistancemeasures. It should also be borne in mindthat company pensions are likewise tax-subsidised, resulting in another potential forsavings.Whether and, if so, to what extent national
savings in Germany will actually increase de-pends on the assisted person’s readiness toparticipate, the degree to which existing sav-ings are simply rechannelled and the adverseimplications of assistance on national savings.The aforementioned saving is based on a par-ticipation rate of 100%. According to sur-veys, however, a considerable number ofthose entitled to assistance do not wish totake part in a PPP .
11In addition, switching
existing savings may limit the additionalamount of funds likely to be saved. With acurrent savings ratio of just over 10% ofhouseholds’ disposable income, a pension-related saving of, for example, 4% of grosswages and salaries – which corresponds tojust over 2
12% of disposable income – could
be met fully out of the “existing” savings. It isalso doubtful whether lower income earnerswould be able to make savings which go be-yond the government assistance. Even the fi-nancing of the share of government assist-ance amounting to some 312
12billion (in the
final stage) is likely to partially depress thecurrent level of saving. Either the tax payermust pay more to cover this amount, whichwould reduce their own saving capacity, orcentral government must lower its spending.A smaller crowding-out effect can be expect-ed in the latter case. Studies on the situationin the United States suggest that tax assist-ance for private old-age provision has not (or

11This applies to 20% of those questioned according to

Even if the impact of the additional assistanceon savings behaviour is still uncertain, thebenefit cuts adopted in the statutory pensioninsurance system in Germany do increase theneed for supplementary private provision.This is likely to have a positive effect on theprivate savings ratio depending on the extentto which individuals have not already factoredthe reduction of the pension level into theirown financial planning.
Effects in the financial marketsThe effects of an increased reliance on private
pension schemes on the capital market relateto both changes in national savings and in-vestors preferences. This has implications forthe savings pool and the structure of the cap-ital market – for example, for the role of insti-tutional investors and the time horizon of risktransformation.
Implications of changes in the savings
pool
In addition to the recent pension reform’s in-
fluence on the savings behaviour, the increas-ing ageing of the population may mean that,generally, saving will, first of all, become im-portant for the purpose of safeguarding anadequate income after retirement. However,the additionally mobilised capital may fallwell short of the pension entitlements accu-mulated under the pay-as-you-go system.Even in countries with a high proportion offunded old-age income, around half of theincome is covered by the social security sys-
tems.
13
In the literature, fears have been expressed14
that, given a continuation of current demo-graphic trends over the next 20 years, asharply increased savings volume is to be ex-pected initially but that this will be followedby considerable dissaving and a fall in assetprices when the “baby boomer” generationretires. However, as yet there is no empiricalevidence either for Germany or any othercountry with a high proportion of funded old-age income of a large-scale liquidation ofassets by retired persons. The savings ratios,in actual fact, remain positive even after re-tirement. This is due to the inheritance motiveand an evidently pronounced aversion to therisk of having insufficient financial resourcesavailable when reaching a very old age or ofbeing in need of intensive nursing care.Nonetheless, owing to the falling savingsratios after retirement, a decrease in the aver-age private savings ratio can be expectedover the longer term.

34smaller proportion of post-retirement income
from the pay-as-you-go systems means thatGermany, too, can expect the savings ratioafter reaching retirement to decline moresharply than before. The lower associated de-mand from pensioners for securities andother financial investments will not necessar-ily generate a major price collapse, however.In the internationally linked capital markets,the impact of this loss of demand is unlikelyto be enough to bring about a significant fallin prices.
15It should be borne in mind, how-
ever, that many other countries are also facedwith a similar demographic ageing process.
If the private savings ratio in Germany were
to increase – even though it is already high byinternational standards – as a result of fundedold-age provision, effects on economicgrowth and interest rates are also possible.Depending on the assumption about invest-ment behaviour in an “ageing” society, simu-lations conducted by various authors usingmacro models
16show an initial drop in real
interest rates and a positive influence ongrowth in the economy as a whole. As the“baby boomer” generation enters retire-ment, the associated adverse savings effectslead to a rise in real interest rates which may,in turn, dampen economic growth. Forecastson the development of real interest rates andgrowth are particularly influenced by the ratiobetween the positive effects caused by in-creasing savings capital and the negative ef-fects resulting from a declining number ofemployed persons.Effects of increasingly institutionalised
investment
It is frequently suggested that a partial transi-
tion from the pay-as-you-go system to thefunded system – irrespective of the questionof a larger savings pool – will have positive ef-fects on the capital market in terms of the“maturity of the market”, its “innovative cap-abilities”, the “efficiency of information pro-cessing” and the “handling of control prob-lems”.
Most countries which have placed greater
emphasis on a funded pension system haveoften experienced a shift from private to insti-tutional investors and from shorter to longer-tem investment.
17In turn, the increase in in-
stitutionalisation has led to greater invest-ment in equities, thus promoting the develop-ment of the market for corporate stocks andshares.
18However, diversification strategies
are also likely to encourage the demand forunsecuritised risk capital or debt securities,say, from smaller enterprises or enterpriseswith a higher risk of insolvency. In order to

35hedge against such risky positions and to op-
timise the risk/return profile, competition be-tween the individual mutual funds will accel-erate the development of new hedging in-struments. Thus, a high degree of institution-alisation of investment has been conducive tothe development and use of, for example,index options in some countries.
In Germany during the 1990s, however, there
was a discernible trend in private investmenttowards mutual funds shares and equities,while the scale of investment in bonds andbank deposits was, if anything, below aver-age. Payments into insurance corporations re-mained high. Even though there has been in-creased participation in lower-risk investmentrecently, during the last ten years the propor-tion of shares in households’ financial assets,either through direct investment or investmentfunds, has risen sharply (see the chart oppos-ite). However, the extent to which this indi-cates a decision by investors to step up fundedold-age provision remains an open question.
Another positive effect of institutionalised fi-
nancial investment
19is increased efficiency in
processing information available to the gen-eral public. Owing to increasing returns toscale, the information-processing costs of asingle large institutional investor are lowerthan those of a larger number of smaller pri-vate investors. The experience of the UnitedKingdom
20shows that initial public offerings
(IPOs) which were largely absorbed by institu-tional investors have shown a more favour-able performance in the past than new issuesbought primarily by private investors, whichindicates a “better” processing of informa-
tion.

greater institutionalisation of asset formationis an improved control of delegation problemsYear-end data

36which occur in listed companies as a result of
the separation of ownership and manage-ment. As a general rule, a small number oflarge (institutional) investors is easier to or-ganise than a large number of small share-holders, consequently improving the exercis-ing of control and co-determination rights.Also, an increasing proportion of shares heldby one investor tends to make it more diffi-cult to sell them on account of negative pricereactions. This means that the “voice option”becomes more attractive than the “exit op-tion”. In addition, global investors will pressfor a standardisation of the national account-ing rules and encourage the establishment ofprivate rating agencies which can, for ex-ample, penalise poor corporate governanceby means of downgrading.
An increase in institutional asset management
is, however, often linked to a greater risk of“herding behaviour” and greater volatility inthe financial markets. Parallel behaviour by in-vestors can cause persistent asset price mis-alignments particularly on the stock markets,such as bubbles. Managers of investment cor-porations are often paid in relation to the suc-cess of other investors. Furthermore, the rela-tive performance assessments are carried outat short intervals. On the one hand, thismeans that index-tracking strategies reducethe risk of underperforming the competition.On the other hand, long-term risk/return opti-misation strategies are often made subservientto short-term profit considerations. There areindications, however, that pension funds witha payout objective pay greater attention tolong-term optimisation strategies. Institutionalinvestors also have the opportunity to respondquickly to each piece of new information in
the market because – in addition to beingable to process information more efficiently –instruments for adjusting the portfolio aremore readily available. This means that fluctu-ations will increase owing to short-term ad-justment reactions in the securities marketsbut that, over the long term, capital marketprices will reflect the disposable informationmore quickly and thus be more “informationefficient”.
The increasing institutionalisation of invest-
ment raises the question as to the appropri-ate supervision and regulation of suppliers ofinvestment products for old-age provision.Firstly, all suppliers of assisted old-age pen-sion contracts are subject to national supervi-sion by the newly established German Finan-cial Supervisory Authority (BAFin). A series offurther restrictions pertaining to the invest-ment horizon, form of payout and mainte-nance of value apply to the investment prod-ucts promoted under the Retirement PensionAct. The suppliers’ obligation of disclosureand prudence, which are designed to protectinvestors without restricting their investmentopportunities, are of a more general nature.Disclosure requirements are intended to pro-vide information on the main areas of invest-ment and the use of the funds. A generaldocumentation of the investment decisionstaken by the fund or insurance manager isneeded to give the investors better insightinto and control of the quality of manage-ment. This documentation is also assessed byprivate fund rating agencies as an indicationof the quality of the management. It enablesthe investor to verify whether decisions have

37been taken in his/her best interests, whether
the management has carelessly or negligent-ly ignored market information, or whetherthere is a conflict of interest.
In addition to the disclosure requirements for
investment, there exist further statutory obli-gations
21based on the principle of risk diver-
sification or, more generally, the principle ofcommercial prudence. In addition to diversifi-cation, the “prudent person rule” in coun-tries which have adopted the Anglo-Saxonmodel includes a broad matching of assetsand liabilities or a hedging against reducedpayments.
22However, this is not achieved
by means of quantitative regulations butthrough liability regulations for the fundsmanager. This is attributable to the fact thatsuppliers, as market players, are better in-formed about investment and hedging op-portunities than the government and aretherefore at liberty to decide on specificforms of investment but must justify theirsuccess or failure to the investors. Empiricalstudies indicate that quantitative investmentrestrictions may lead to sub-optimal risk/return profiles, thus depressing the risk-adjusted yield of the fund.
23
Effects of long-term investment
In addition to the current minimum-term in-
vestment for statutorily assisted savings of upto 12 years,
24the investment horizon for old-
age provision investment may be over 40years depending on the age of the investor.For the capital market, this means that instru-ments with longer maturities are in increasingdemand
25in order to minimise the reinvest-
ment risk.
It is mainly shares that come into consider-
ation for this purpose since there is no limit ofany kind on their maturity. However, in thecase of the government-assisted old-age pen-sion contracts, asset fluctuations are especial-ly problematic at the beginning of the payoutperiod. Therefore, it is prudent to deploylonger-term hedging instruments as well. Atpresent, asset fluctuations can be offset onlyas a whole or downwards by forward con-tracts and derivatives. While the former canrun longer depending on the individualagreement, the latter are mostly limited to amaximum one-year maturity. It is conceivablethat players in the financial markets will de-velop new hedging strategies in order keepthe risk reduction as cost-efficient as possible

24Under the Personal Asset Acquisition Act, capital in-
vestments with a minimum maturity of six or seven years
can be assisted. In the case of life insurance, the possibil-
ity of reselling the investments tax-free exists after 12
years at the earliest.
25In contrast to investment funds (61.3%), pension
funds in Europe in 1995 held a much higher proportion

38over the long term.26Even so, each risk must
be assumed by a counterparty.
Past experience suggests that buying “se-
cure” long-term government bonds is onepossibility – albeit with a smaller gross yield –of minimising asset fluctuations over longperiods of time. Stripping of debt instrumentshas the advantage that the principal and theinterest coupons can be separated, thus split-ting an investment into various componentsand creating investment opportunities in allmaturity categories. The investment methodof synchronising the investment period andthe residual maturity of the investment instru-ment, known as “duration matching”, isused, for example, in the UK by pensionfunds. Consequently, as a result of the strongdemand for a limited volume of UK govern-ment bonds with a 30-year maturity, their
prices are relatively high, and the returns low.In other countries with an appreciable volumeof company and private pensions, too, suchas the United States and Denmark, a smallerspread is observed between governmentbonds with ten and 30-year maturities (seethe chart opposite), which attests to thesoundness of the funds’ investment policiesbut does not guarantee a high yield for theinvestors.
Concluding remarks
The recent pension reform paves the way for
a larger funded component of pension provi-sion. The increase in individual provision forretirement income, which is necessary pre-cisely as a result of demographic develop-ments, broadens the base of retirement provi-sion and is also likely to prove advantageousin terms of risk diversification. The reductionsin benefits under the pay-as-you-go systemhave been linked to a considerable measureof government assistance for private pensionprovision. An average earner can save a max-imum of 13
12% of his income in 2008 by
using the new assistance resources. Since theincrease in the amount of individual savingwill depend, however, on the participation1999 2000 2001 2002Monthly averages

26The implementation of the nominal value guarantee
required for the assisted old-age provision products per-
mits an offsetting of risk throughout the residual maturity
of the investment. Price losses in the case of investment
in risk-prone securities, for example, can be offset by sub-
sequent gains from “secure” fixed-rate investment, as
long as this is high enough to compensate for the loss in
an immediate reallocation. Since, such “hedging” would
incur costs only in the event of a reallocation, the yield of
the investment is not diminished in most cases. Neverthe-
less, it is only the paid-in amounts that are hedged.Government

Effects on the financial market will not only
be produced by the size of the potential add-itional savings pool and its impact on interestrates and growth. The structure of the capitalmarket could also be influenced by shifts inthe composition of the investors and changesin investment behaviour. An increasing shiftfrom private to institutional investment, andfrom shorter to longer-term investment in-struments will provide opportunities for astronger development of the market for cor-porate stocks and shares and the introduction
of new hedging instruments. Owing to infor-mation processing advantages and a more in-tensive exercising of controlling and co-determination rights, institutional investors,such as newly introduced pension funds inthe field of company pensions, are likely tostrengthen the bias towards a return-orientedcorporate policy. Risks which arise throughthe institutionalisation of investment, shouldnot be countered by an excessive restrictionof investment opportunities and the associ-ated yield opportunities but rather by liabilityrules and disclosure requirements.

41Monetary policy
and investmentbehaviour –an empirical studyThe effect of monetary policy measures
on corporate investment decisions isgenerally regarded as a key element inthe transmission process. Monetary pol-icy affects investment decisions via theuser cost of capital – a mechanismcalled the interest-rate channel. In add-ition, with imperfect capital markets,changes in a company’s financial situ-ation can affect its demand for fixedcapital, bringing the “balance-sheetchannel” into play.
In the present article, individual data
for the German manufacturing sectorfrom 1988 to 1997 are used to subjectthe interest-rate channel and balance-sheet channel to a thorough econo-metric investigation. The investigationshows that by European standards Ger-man investment behaviour is highlysensitive to the user cost of capital.However, the impact of interest-ratechanges on the user cost of capital isonly moderate. The empirical findingalso confirms the existence of a bal-ance-sheet channel. This channel, how-ever, seems to be less important thanthe interest-rate channel. One import-ant reason might lie in the significanceof “house banking relationships”,which are a unique feature of the Ger-man financial system.

42Monetary transmission channels
The principal task of a central bank is to
maintain price stability. The extent to which itperforms this task successfully and the cred-ibility of its efforts have long-run implicationsfor the real economy, too. In this context, in-dividual policy actions might be less import-ant than the underlying monetary policyframework. If there is an absence of clarity re-garding the strategy and objectives of monet-ary policy, inflation premia and risk premiawill result, leading to higher real interest ratesand deformed yield curves, which are dele-terious to growth.
1Conversely, the real
interest-rate advantage the German economyhad held in comparison to its Europeanneighbours for many years may serve as apositive example.
Over the short and medium run, monetary
policy measures have additional real effects.They are links in complex transmission chan-nels between the use of monetary policy in-struments, on the one hand, and changes infactor and goods prices, on the other.
2Ana-
lytically speaking, there are two distinctstages of monetary transmission. In the firststage, monetary policy measures impact onvarious segments of financial markets, whichis reflected in adjustments of market ratesand asset prices, exchange rates and other fi-nancial conditions (eg maturity structure). Ina second stage, these changes alter domesticsectors’ propensity to spend and are thustransmitted to the overall goods and incomescycle. An especially important factor here isthe way monetary policy measures influencecorporate investment behaviour. Corporateinvestment is a very volatile component of ag-
gregate demand, and its capacity and mod-ernity effects make it an important factor ingrowth and employment. The following ex-position will focus on this second stage of themonetary transmission process.

The interest-rate channel
The theoretical starting point for analysing
the interplay between the financial sectorand a firm’s factor demand is the fundamen-tal separation theorem.
4Its central tenet is
that, with perfect capital markets, the valueof a firm will always be independent of its fi-nancial structure, which means the decisionson factor demand and financing may be sep-arated. Hence factor demand depends exclu-sively on “real” factors such as productiontechnology, installation costs and current andfuture values of capital-goods prices, interestrates and demand for produced goods. Insuch a setting, the user cost of capital is themost important variable by which monetarypolicy can influence investment activity. This

43is also known as the interest-rate channel
with respect to investment demand, whichhas attracted widespread public attention.However, it pays to note that the centralbank’s influence on real financing costs is verylimited. Over the long run, the attempt topush real capital-market rates below theirequilibrium rate by means of an expansionarymonetary policy would only drive up infla-tion.

The user cost of capital is the price of usingcapital within a period of time. In this it iscomparable to wages, which are the price forthe services of labour as a factor of produc-tion. In the long run, profit-oriented firms willenlarge or decrease their capital stock untilthe yield of the marginal unit of capital is justenough to cover the cost of its use. For thatreason, the user cost of capital is a core elem-ent of investment research.
The measurement of user cost is only simple
if a leasing contract exists. Like a labour con-tract, the cost of using the factor can then betaken directly from the contractual agree-ment governing its use. In most cases, how-ever, the situation is more complex. Capitalgoods are purchased by firms and then pro-vide services over a lengthy period of time;for technical and economic reasons theyneed to be written down. The total costsmust be imputed to each respective period ofuse in an economically correct way. Whatneeds to be calculated is the expenditure (ex-pressed in terms of units of the manufacturedgood) which the investor would incur if hepurchased a capital good at the beginning ofa period, put it to productive use during theperiod, partially depreciated it, and resold it
at the end of the period.
The use of a capital good is initially associated
with (arithmetical or effective) financing costsequivalent to a nominal capital-market ratebut is reduced by the amount by which thenominal value of capital goods has increasedup to the point in time of sale. Thus, the realrate of interest with regard to capital goodsprice inflation is the key determinant. The realcosts of depreciation are an additional com-ponent. Finally, the influence of fiscal factorsneeds to be taken into account. Taxes onearnings, such as corporation tax, have thesame effect as increasing the user cost. Onthe other hand, the user cost falls commen-surately with the implicit reduction of thecapital good’s purchase price by the presentvalue of the tax depreciation allowanceswhich are claimed when the profit is deter-mined, or by government investment pre-miums.

The credit channel
Many empirical studies had difficulty explain-
ing the short and medium-run influence ofmonetary policy on macroeconomic activity
5See Deutsche Bundesbank, Real interest rates: move-
ments and determinants, loc cit.
6Under the influence of the taxation of income from
capital, the nominal discount rate can depend on the
type of financing, which already represents a step away
from the simple neo-classical world. On this subject, and
on the empirical implementation of the concept of the
user cost of capital, see the studies by M A King, Public
Policy and the Corporation, London, 1977; M A King and

44solely via the interest-rate channel.7The
term “credit channel” subsumes mechanismsthrough which imperfect financial marketsamplify conventional interest-rate effects. Thestarting point is the idea that, with imperfectfinancial markets, the cost of external refi-nancing is higher than the riskless rate. Thereason for this difference is not the defaultrisk as such. Even in perfect markets theagreed interest rate contains a default pre-mium. However, in this situation the expectedpayments of the creditor are equal to the ex-pected earnings of the debtor. The defaultpremium is merely compensation for the pos-sibility that the debtor may, under certain cir-cumstances, not meet his payment obliga-tions in full or at all. The (expected) costs ofexternal finance from the point of view of thefirm and the lender correspond to the risk-less rate.
On competitive markets this point remains
valid from the point of view of risk-neutrallenders even if imperfections exist. However,if there is information asymmetry, the debtorwill have to pay a premium for debt financingwhich covers the lender’s expected additionalcosts. There are many possible reasons forsuch additional costs:
– If the borrower has more information
than the lender, the interest rate will con-tain a lemon’s premium which protectsthe creditor from opportunistic behaviouron the part of the debtor.
– Where the credit relationship is disrupted,
costs are incurred for monitoring, assess-ing and collecting the debt.– In a theoretical equilibrium the moral haz-
ard problem means that the borrower’sscope for action is hemmed in because,for instance, he will be restricted to pro-jects which can be posted as collateral;this creates inefficiencies.
In lending contracts which are entered into
given such imperfections, the added costs areinternalised with the borrower. The expectedcosts of external finance are therefore higherfor the borrower than the lender’s expectedreturn. These additional costs are called theexternal finance premium, the amount ofwhich depends on the borrower’s expecteddefault risk. Like the tax wedge in the capitalor labour markets, it creates efficiency losses.
The creditor’s expected return is equal to the
opportunity costs of finance on the side ofthe debtor, if the latter had internally gener-ated funds at his disposal. That is certainlythe case if the other option for using theavailable funds is to lend them. Therefore onemay alternatively speak of a cost differentialbetween external finance and internal fi-nance. This clearly shows that if the total fi-nancing volume for an enterprise is given, thelevel of the premium depends on the amountof own funds or, more precisely, the totalvalue of assets which can be used as a collat-eral in such a way that the transaction is freeof additional costs to the creditor. Above thislevel, the probability of default will rise, and

45the external finance premium will be an in-
creasing function of the financing volume.8
The chart on page 46 illustrates the relation-ship in a stylised manner. All enterprises onthe rising slope of the curve are financiallyconstrained. Their cost of capital is deter-mined by the difference between the needfor finance and own funds. The case of whatis called “credit rationing” is merely an ex-treme type of financial restriction.
9Credit is
rationed if there is no interest rate at whichlenders are willing to accept an increase inthe lending volume. In a rationing situationan interest-rate hike would give investors anincentive to indulge in excessively risky behav-iour and leave too many bad debtors in abank’s portfolio. To keep the expected returnfrom falling, the lender has no choice but torestrict the quantity of loans.
10
A credit channel exists if monetary policy af-fects not only the riskless rate but also directlyor indirectly the external finance premium.One may distinguish between two classes ofpossible mechanisms. A bank-lending chan-nel presupposes that a segment of debtorshas to rely on bank lending for finance. Now,if a monetary policy measure ends up restrict-ing the ability of banks to lend, the financingcosts for this group of borrowers tend to riseparticularly sharply. The costs of external fi-nance increase, and the demand for real cap-ital decreases. Although the existence of abank-lending channel cannot be ruled out forGermany, its influence seems to be moder-ated by banks’ liquidity management.
11Whereas the bank-lending channel presup-poses the existence of a bank as a lender, thebalance-sheet channel can be active in anytype of lending relationship. What counts isthat the borrower’s financial status has animpact on the external finance premium.Changes in the credit rating of borrowersthen cause reactions of their real demand. Ifthis then results in endogenous procyclicalchanges in the financial situation of debtors,the mechanism will amplify cyclical move-ments. This type of interplay in the businesscycle is summed up as a “financial acceler-ator”. Such reactions of the financing pre-mium are by no means limited to monetarypolicy measures but can amplify the impactof any cyclical stimulus.
A balance-sheet channel as a part of a more
comprehensive credit channel is said to existif monetary policy influences the financialsituation of (potential) borrowers and therebyunleashes real effects. The effects of a monet-ary stimulus along the balance-sheet channelare primarily direct effects. An expansionarymonetary policy, for instance, causes the

46interest burden on outstanding loans which
need to be refinanced over time to fall. Thatcauses profits, and therefore also the abilityto generate internal finance, to rise. Thechart shows that this cash-flow effect shiftsthe financing cost curve to the right. In thenew financing situation, the demand for realcapital is higher, and a sequence of positivenet investment sets in, which should bringthe firms to a new equilibrium. Similar effectsare produced by all circumstances which in-fluence the probability of default and thecredit rating of borrowers at a given financingvolume. The effects of changes in the interestrate on asset prices are also direct effects –the prices of marketable balance-sheet assetsare naturally important for the collateral limit.Moreover, indirect effects may also occur. If
consumers or investors increase their final de-mand because of an expansionary monetarypolicy measure, upstream sellers encounteradditional demand, increasing their ability toraise finance internally. That can intensify cyc-lical swings due to chain reactions.
12In add-
ition, the impact of the financial acceleratorand the balance-sheet channel are asymmet-rical in two respects. One is that only finan-cially constrained enterprises are affected,not all enterprises. The other is that sincethere are more financially constrained firms ina recession than in a boom, the financial ac-celerator has a stronger impact in downturnsthan in boom years.

47An empirical study using individual data
For a variety of reasons it is difficult to com-
prehend the monetary transmission processby using aggregated data alone. Econometricstudies of the interest-rate channel are ham-pered by the fact that the macroeconomicreal interest rate is endogenous and procycli-cal. Detecting the financial accelerator is alsofraught with problems. The most importantempirical implication, namely that differentgroups of firms are affected differently bymonetary policy measures, cannot be recog-nised in aggregated data.
14
For those reasons it makes sense to use indi-vidual data to study transmission mechanismssince this also enables the use of the cross-sectional dimension to identify the channels.Such a study was conducted by the Bundes-bank as the German contribution to theMonetary Transmission Network (MTN) in theEuropean System of Central Banks.
15The re-
sults obtained by the MTN are very importantnot least because they permit Europeancountries to be compared directly.
16
The study was conducted on the basis offinancial statements which make up theDeutsche Bundesbank’s corporate balance-sheet statistics. This is by far the most com-prehensive statistical evaluation of financialstatements of German non-MFIs. These datawere generated when the Deutsche Bundes-bank’s monetary market operations were stilllargely bill-based. The discounting of tradebills made it necessary to check enterprises’credit rating. Up until the end of the 1990ssome 70,000 financial statements were col-lected and processed by the Bundesbank
branch offices on average every year.
17Fol-
lowing a thorough review and inspection,they form the pool of data used for corporatebalance-sheet statistics.

Once statistical outliers have been eliminated,44,345 firm/year observations for 6,408 firmsare left. In 1996 the total turnover of thecompanies in the dataset was DM 963.6 bil-lion, or 42.3% of total sector turnover inwestern Germany and 61.4% of the turnoverof manufacturing corporations in all of Ger-many. The average number of employees percompany was 119. That means the samplecontains a rather large percentage of me-dium-sized enterprises, which form the back-bone of west German industry.
These data are used to estimate a neo-classic-
al model of demand for the stock of capitalwhich is extended by adding financial indica-tors. (The estimation equation is explained indepth on p 50 f.) The dependent variable isthe investment rate, ie the ratio of gross cap-ital formation to a company’s capital stock.Explanatory variables include not only theuser cost
19and real sales growth but also the
cash-flow ratio, ie the ratio of real cash flowto the capital stock. In addition, lagged valuesof the dependent variables are included.
The significance of the interest-rate and
credit channels
Since the estimation equation has its origins
in a model of demand for the stock of capital,the significance of the interest-rate channelshould initially be measured by means of thereaction of the capital demand to changes inits user cost, or more specifically, the percent-age change in capital demand if the user costis increased by 1%. The preferred estimationprovides a value of -0.21 for the first year and-0.44 as a long-run reaction to a permanent
increase in the user cost. Although the lattervalue is still clearly below the theoretical ref-erence value of -1 for a Cobb-Douglas pro-duction function, the long-run user-cost elas-ticity seems rather high by European stand-ards. Using the same specification, for in-stance, a long-run elasticity of -0.28 is esti-mated for Spain; the value for Italy is -0.20,and for France the estimated long-run elasti-city approaches 0.
20For the United States, a
similar estimation produced a long-run elasti-city in the vicinity of -0.25.
21
For a credit channel to exist on top of theinterest-rate channel, it is necessary thatsome of the enterprises be financially con-strained and that this affects their behaviour.Ever since the seminal work by Fazzari, Hub-bard and Peterson,
22the typical approach in
empirical research has been to use a priori cri-teria such as firm size, dividend payments andthe structure of the capital stock to identifythose firms which can be assumed to be fi-nancially constrained. If the investment de-mand of such firms has a greater sensitivity tokey financial variables such as cash flow or li-quidity, this is claimed as evidence of the ex-istence of a financial accelerator as a precon-dition for a balance-sheet channel.
19For details on how the user cost variable is constructed
see U von Kalckreuth, 2001, loc cit, Appendix C.
20See J B Chatelain et al, loc cit. However, Chatelain et
al calculate the user cost differently. Using their defin-
ition, Germany’s user-cost elasticity is estimated as -0.52.

49In order to counter recent criticism of this ap-
proach,23this study measures financial con-
straints directly. The groups are formed onthe basis of creditworthiness data gatheredusing the Bundesbank’s discriminant analysisprocedure.
24Also, firm-specific changes in
the credit rating measured in this manner canbe used to measure the impact of the finan-cial accelerator directly and not via the differ-ence in cash-flow sensitivity.
The study confirms the existence of a bal-
ance-sheet channel in the German monetarytransmission process. Poorly rated firms havea greater cash-flow sensitivity than well-ratedfirms. In addition, their ability to react tothe neo-classical determinants of “sales” and“user cost of capital” is distinctly lower. Also,if the creditworthiness ratio is included in theestimated equation as an independent ex-planatory variable, the impact of an improve-ment in credit rating (on the basis of the lastfinancial statement) on investment behaviourin the current year is unambiguously positive.On the whole, this must be interpreted asclear empirical evidence that a financial accel-erator does exist in Germany.
25
The existence in Germany of both the inter-est-rate channel and the balance-sheet chan-nel thus have found empirical support. Yetdoes that mean these two channels are alsoequally important to the monetary transmis-sion process? A simulation based on the esti-mated investment function can be used to as-sess the relative strength of the two channels.It is assumed that owing to a monetary policymeasure the capital-market interest ratesrelevant to corporate financing will rise from7% to 8% for a two-year period. The key
first phase of the transmission process be-tween intervention on the money market andthe adjustment of the yield curve is disregard-ed here. Further, it is assumed that inflationexpectations are not adjusted, ie in this men-tal experiment a nominal change in interestrates causes expected real interest rates tochange commensurately. It must be empha-sised that this simulation is only intended tohighlight the dynamic characteristics of theestimated investment equation in terms ofthe relative strength of a given change in thereal interest rate along both channels and isnot capable of depicting the entire monetarytransmission process in all its complexity. Ac-count would need to be taken not only of theformation of expectations regarding monet-ary policy and the pattern of investment andoutput prices but also of the formation of theyield curve and the impact on the demand forthe produced good.
26
The simulated change in the interest rate hastwo key consequences. One is that it in-creases the discount rate that enters into theuser cost of capital. Its impact on investmentspending depends on the estimated user-cost

50Deutsche BundesbankAn estimation equation for investment behaviour
The starting point for the microeconometric in-
vestigation is a neo-classical investment functionbased on a model of demand for fixed assets.
1
Assuming a generalised CES production func-tion, the necessary first-order conditions for astatic maximum profit create a linear relation-ship between the logarithmic demand for thestock of capital and the logarithmic values ofthe user cost of capital and the level of the firm’sactivity.
2The stock demand is translated into a
demand for investment flows by relating the re-lative changes in the desired capital stock to theuser cost of capital (UC) and sales (S). By includ-ing lagged values of the exogenous and endo-genous variables in the regression equation, theadjustment is spread over time. This allows lagsin expectation formation, decision-making andpurchasing, as well as the impact of installation
and fitting costs, to implicitly be taken into ac-count.
3
Current and lagged values of the ratio of com-pany cash flow to capital stock (CF/K) are enteredinto the equation to take account of how the ca-pital flow generated in the sales process influ-ences the formation of expectations and the abil-ity to generate internal finance. The estimatedinvestment equation with the investment rate(I/K) as an independent variable is specified asfollows.

The user-cost elasticity of the long-term demand
for the stock of capital, h
UC, corresponds to the
sum of all impacts of an increase in the logarith-mic user cost of capital on the logarithmic capi-tal stock. Changes in the logarithmic capitalstock can be approximated by changes in therate of investment. A lasting increase in the usercost corresponds to a one-time change in thelogarithmic difference. This gives:
ηUC = Σ γn /(1– Σ αI)n=0N
l=0L
An analogous expression measures the signifi-
cance of a company’s level of activity as a sum ofthe changes in the logarithmic capital stock as aconsequence of a permanent change in logarith-mic sales, ie a one-off increase in its growth rate.With regard to the cash-flow ratio, though, itmakes more sense to observe a one-off inflow ofliquidity.
4From this, too, the above pattern canbe used to calculate the long-run effect as a sum
of the changes in the capital stock triggered inthat manner. Technically speaking, this is a semi-elasticity of the capital demand with respect tothe cash-flow ratio. It corresponds to the long-run change in the capital stock as a reaction toan inflow of liquidity, ie to a marginal propen-sity to spend on capital goods from internal fi-nancing.
Enterprises are classified by size according to the
average number of employees (n). Their classifi-cation into creditworthiness classes is based onthe discriminant analysis method used by theBundesbank.
in the cash flow ratio would lead to a lasting change in the capital
stock’s growth rate. However, in the long run the cash-flow ratio isendogenous and hinges on the same technology which determinesthe other parameters of the investment equation. For that reason,
permanent changes in the cash flow ratio should not be seen in isola-tion.

52elasticity. The other consequence is that the
change in the interest rate leads to an in-crease in ongoing payments to external pro-viders of capital, which reduces the ability togenerate finance internally. The strength ofthis partial effect is influenced by the indebt-edness of a firm, the maturity structure of itsexternal capital and the estimated cash-flowsensitivity of investment.
27
For the sake of comparison, the effect of thechange in the user cost is identified with theinterest-rate channel, whereas the impact ofa change in the ability to generate finance in-ternally will be used to denote the balance-sheet channel. This classification probablyoverstates the balance-sheet channel’s im-portance since the dependence of investmenton the current cash flow is not only given byfinancial constraints but also reflects the sig-nificance of current profits for assessing theprofitability of future projects. By contrast,the importance of the interest-rate channeltends to be understated since a tight-moneypolicy can also lead to shortfalls in orders re-ceived by downstream firms, which wouldnegatively affect the sales variable in the in-vestment function.
However, the simulation shows quite clearly
that the interest-rate channel is dominant. Itcauses investment demand to fall, in com-parison with the baseline scenario, by 3.90%in the first period and by 3.65% in thesecond. Through the credit channel, by con-trast, investment demand falls by 0.34% inthe first period and by 0.41% in the secondwith respect to the status quo. Comparedwith the effect of the interest-rate channel,this is not very much. The income effects of
increased interest payments, at least, are thusonly of minor importance. However, it is pos-sible that the impact of a worsened credit rat-ing might also enter into the mix.
Monetary transmission and the house
banking principle
A further outcome of the study is interesting
from an economic policy perspective, too: thesize of a firm does not seem to play a decisiverole in the existence of financial constraints inGermany. In the estimates for the period from1988 to 1997 the cash-flow sensitivity of in-vestment demand was not significantly high-er for small enterprises than for the rest ofthe sample.
28The user-cost and sales sensitiv-
ity of smaller firms is greater than that oflarge companies, whereas firms with a badcredit rating appear paralysed compared withcompanies with a good credit rating: the re-action of the former to economic incentives isalmost undetectable. On the whole, a clear
27For details of the simulation see U von Kalckreuth,

28This outcome confirms an earlier statement by E Stöss
on the credit channel and is consistent with a study by
D Kalt for Switzerland. M Ehrmann evaluates Ifo business
climate indicators and finds that small firms are hit harder
by cyclical shocks. However, this is not necessarily attrib-
utable to poorer terms of finance. See E Stöss, Enter-

53distinction must be drawn between the size
of a firm and its creditworthiness.
German investment behaviour has a series of
special features that set it apart from otherEuropean countries. The significance of in-ternally generated finance for current invest-ment behaviour is relatively low.
29German
enterprises are also able to react swiftly andclearly to economic incentives such aschanges in the user cost of capital or in salespatterns.
It would seem appropriate to establish a link
between the robustness of German enter-prises with respect to variations in cash flowand a feature peculiar to the German finan-cial system, the house banking principle.
30
The term “house bank” is used to denote acredit institution which enters a long-termbusiness relationship with a certain companybased on an intensive exchange of informa-tion and implied insurance against liquidityshortfalls and sharp fluctuations in refinan-cing costs.
31The relationship between the
company and its house bank is characterisedby a sort of exclusivity. It is possible for the en-terprise to have business relations with otherbanks, but it generally has only one housebank.
32
The intensive attention a bank gives to its cus-tomer reduces information asymmetry be-tween lender and borrower. This relievessome of the root cause of financial con-straints. The insurance aspect of house bank-ing implies, further, that to a certain extentthe bank will maintain its lending even if thecustomer encounters financial difficulties. Onthe whole, this makes the financing of entre-
preneurial investment projects relatively inde-pendent of the given liquidity and financialsituation. Another indicator of the signifi-cance of the house banking principle in Ger-many is that the bank-lending channel seemsto be weaker in Germany than in France, Italyor Spain. The estimated reduction in banklending caused by a tight-money policyseems to be relatively low in Germany.
33
Studies have shown that in investment de-mand the interest-rate channel is rather im-portant for monetary transmission in Ger-many, while financial factors tend to recedeinto the background. It is natural to interpretthis pattern in the light of the special featuresof the German financial system. However, itmust be stressed that all econometric studies,by definition, present a picture of the past.

54Therefore, it remains necessary to carefully
monitor developments in the capitalisation ofthe corporate sector and the consequencesthat the structural change currently takingplace in the German and European financialsystem will have for the monetary transmis-sion process. Regardless of that, the complextransmission process between monetary pol-
icy and real or monetary variables provides akey argument against unnecessary activityand tinkering with economic policy for short-term gain and in favour of a steady hand andpredictability in the context of a medium-term stability strategy.

55Reports from the
Economic ResearchCentreThe stable long-run CAPM and the
cross-section of expected returns1
Discussion paper 05/02by Jeong-Ryeol Kim
Central banks are more and more concerned
with the financial markets, not only becauseof their importance for monetary policy butalso because they play a key role in assessingthe risks facing financial institutions. Despitenumerous theoretical and empirical criticisms,the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) re-mains one of the most popular standard ana-lytical tools in this field. It can be used forquantifying the trade-off between risk andthe expected return in financial markets.According to this model, a linear relationshipexists between the expected return on a par-ticular share and the return on the overallmarket portfolio, which is expressed by whatis known as the market beta.
In line with many reports from the 1970s and
1980s regarding anomalies, however, there ismounting evidence in the literature of thepoor empirical performance of the conven-tional CAPM. Various modifications aimed atimproving the empirical performance of theconventional CAPM have therefore been pro-posed.
This paper presents a modification of the
traditional CAPM designed to improve themodel’s empirical performance. It takes intoaccount the fact that the distribution of re-

56turns on stock markets can be captured bet-
ter by a generalised Paretian distribution thanby a normal distribution. The paper also notesthat information concerning a stock’s expect-ed return can be obtained additionally fromthe common stochastic trend between twostock prices. This model may be called astable long-run CAPM (SLCAPM).
In order to demonstrate the empirical per-
formance of the SLCAPM, the model’s per-formance is compared with that of somewell-known alternative CAPMs such as thebook-to-market CAPM devised by Fama andFrench and the conditional CAPM devisedby Jagannathan and Wang. It turns outthat the SLCAPM explains over 60% of thecross-sectional variation in the average re-turns of stocks of companies listed on theNew York Stock Exchange and the AmericanStock Exchange. This is more than the alter-native models, even though they make add-itional use of firm-specific variables.
The modification proposed in the paper thus
improves the empirical performance of theCAPM and hence can be used to improve therisk assessment of portfolios.
Price rigidity, the mark-up and the
dynamics of the current account
2
Discussion paper 14/02by Giovanni Lombardo
In this study we show that the degree of im-
perfect competition in the market for goodscan have important effects on the speed ofprice adjustments and hence on the response
of the current account to shocks (in particularnominal shocks).
An expansionary monetary shock causes the
domestic currency to depreciate and, in thepresence of price rigidities, it makes domesticgoods cheaper than foreign goods. Domesticand foreign demand would consequentlyswitch to some extent to domestic goods.Whether or not that causes an improvementin the current account depends on the rela-tive elasticity of the demand for exports andimports. In turn, these elasticities depend onthe degree of substitutability between do-mestic goods and imported goods. The factthat these goods might not be perfect substi-tutes does not necessarily imply that the do-mestic market is imperfectly competitive. It isconceivable that domestic firms are not al-ways able to exploit (ie to derive profits from)this differentiation between domestic andforeign goods. The degree of competitionand import/export elasticities are thereforetwo distinct concepts. Nevertheless, the dis-cussion paper shows that the degree of com-petition in the domestic market can affect theresponse of the current account to shocks.
This mechanism is based on the fact that the
degree of competition can determine the sizeof the price adjustments when not all firmsadjust their prices simultaneously. The magni-tude of price adjustments, in turn, determinesthe extent of the “expenditure switching”

57and hence the response of the current ac-
count.
In the model presented here, the link be-
tween competition and price adjustmentscentres on the use of material factors of pro-duction. It is shown that when producedgoods enter the production process as meansof production, the degree of competition isinversely correlated with the response of thecurrent account to monetary shocks. Whenthe markets are imperfectly competitive, theshare of output that can be attributed to thefactors of production is smaller than thatwhich would accrue to them in a perfectlycompetitive world. For a technology that em-ploys intermediate goods, the share of thesegoods in production is proportional to the de-gree of competition in the economy: thegreater the competition, the larger the share.A larger share of intermediate goods impliesthat more of the resources available in theeconomy must be used to produce thesegoods and, in a world of scarce resources,this will increase production costs and hencethe “efficient” price of output. If a firm de-cides (or is able) to adjust its price, it will fac-tor the increased cost of production into theprice. It can therefore be seen that the degreeof competition affects the degree (speed) atwhich the price of domestically producedgoods adjusts to monetary shocks. The de-gree of price adjustment will in turn affectthe “expenditure switching” of internationaldemand and, hence, the response of the cur-rent account to shocks.
Whether the current accounts in more com-
petitive economies tend to be more respon-sive to shocks (in particular nominal shocks) is
an empirical question. Indeed, there are otherfactors influencing the relationship betweencompetition and price adjustments and hencethe current account. Nevertheless, the papershows that the market structure of a country(ie competition and price rigidities) is an im-portant factor that must be taken into ac-count when interpreting the response of thecurrent account to shocks.

Discussion paper 18/02by Karl-Heinz Tödter
This paper discusses the price gap as an indi-
cator of inflationary developments, integratesit into a small monetary macro-model – theP-star model – and examines various monetarypolicy strategies in the context of this model.
The P-star model is a macro-model with a
macroeconomic goods market, a money mar-ket and a response function for the centralbank’s interest rate policy. Inflation is deter-mined by the price gap. This is composed ofthe surplus demand for goods and the surplussupply of money. Interest rate changes arethus transmitted via two channels, the degreeof utilisation of potential output and the sup-ply of liquidity. By contrast, new-Keynesian

namely the degree of utilisation. In the latterinflation is a real rather than a monetary phe-nomenon.
Starting from a long-run money demand
function, the discussion paper examines themonetary overhang, the price gap and thenominal price gap as monetary indicators ofinflationary pressure. Then the P-star modelis compared with a new-Keynesian modelwith regard to stability, disinflation costs andefficiency of monetary policy. It turns outthat a stability-oriented monetary policy per-forms better in a P-star model than in anew-Keynesian model.
Today much space is devoted in economic lit-
erature to the analysis of monetary policystrategies. On the basis of the P-star modelthe discussion paper considers which monet-ary policy strategies are suited to stabilising in-flation and the degree of capacity utilisation.Fluctuations in these variables are triggered inthe model by shocks to the real demand forgoods, prices or the money demand and thenperpetuate themselves in the system.
Inflation targeting has attracted much inter-
est in recent years. It has been adopted byseveral central banks (eg in New Zealand, theUnited Kingdom and Sweden). Three variantsof this monetary policy strategy may be dis-tinguished with regard to the quantity of in-formation presumably available to the centralbank. Central banks pursuing a direct infla-tion targeting strategy orient themselves tothe most recently observed rate of price in-creases, whereas in the case of inflation fore-cast targeting they react to projected price
rises. Optimal inflation targeting further as-sumes that the precise structure of the modelis known. Although within the framework ofthis model perspective the last-mentionedstrategy minimises fluctuations in the infla-tion rate around the central bank’s inflationtarget, it entails larger fluctuations in the de-gree of capacity utilisation than the other al-ternatives mentioned.
Some authors advise central banks not to ori-
ent their policy exclusively to stabilising infla-tion but also to react anticyclically to fluctu-ations in the degree of capacity utilisation, ieto follow a Taylor rule. The Bundesbank, bycontrast, oriented itself to monetary growth(monetary targeting), while the EuropeanCentral Bank pursues a two-pillar strategygeared both to monetary growth and an in-flation projection. It can be seen that thesethree strategies lead to smaller fluctuations inthe degree of capacity utilisation, interestrates and monetary growth than does pureinflation targeting.
P-star models are theoretically and empirically
interesting alternatives to the new-Keynesianmodels that are in widespread use today.They are suitable for analysing monetary pol-icy strategies above all because they takeaccount of the empirical link between themoney stock and the price level and do notreduce the effects of monetary policy to justone transmission channel, namely the interestrate effect on real demand. The decision as towhich monetary policy strategy is the mostappropriate ultimately depends on the centralbank’s particular target system.
