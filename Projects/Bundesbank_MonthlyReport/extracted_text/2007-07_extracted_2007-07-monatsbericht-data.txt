Industry
Industrial activity picked up again in May.
Output went up by a seasonally and calen-
dar-day adjusted 21/C254% following a decline by
the same amount in April. The fall in April,
which was influenced by a “bridge day” ef-
fect, was therefore largely offset. On an aver-
age of the two-month period of April and
May, industrial output still failed to match the
first-quarter average entirely. Nevertheless,
the year-on-year increase went up to 53/C254%.
There was stronger demand for industrial
goods again in May. The volume of new
orders was up sharply on the month in sea-
sonally adjusted terms (31/C254%). On an average
of the April-May period, this represents a 2%
increase on the first quarter, despite the ra-
ther subdued level of growth in April. As in
April, large export orders played a role in May
as well. This was another reason why indus-
trial enterprises were also able to expand
their volume of export orders by 3% on the
quarter. In the case of domestic orders, the
figure was 11/C252%. Producers of consumer
goods and capital goods, in particular, bene-
fited from the positive developments in de-
mand.
The seasonally adjusted value of exports of
goods was down3/C254% in May. At the same
time, however, nominal imports of goods de-
clined by 31/C252%, with the result that the trade
surplus went up by 313/C254billion to 3171/C252bil-
lion. Taking account of the changes in exter-
nal trade prices, exports also seem to haveOutput

6made a positive contribution to growth in the
second quarter.
Construction
There was a slight rise in construction output
in May. Output in this sector was character-
ised by sharp seasonally adjusted declines in
March and April, which was due to output re-
turning to normal following the exceptionally
mild winter. This is also the main reason why
there was such a sharp decline on the first
quarter in the April-May period, at 91/C254%.
Construction demand in May was down
slightly on the month. In April and May as a
whole, it was down 1% on the level of the
first quarter. This was due primarily to the
fact that public authorities were restrained in
terms of placing new orders, although they
did increase their volume of orders very sub-
stantially at the beginning of the year. By con-
trast, on an average of this two-month
period, demand for housing construction was
up 23/C254% on the quarter. No new impulses
were being generated by commercial orders
at the end of the period under review.
Economy as a whole
Overall, the available data indicate that the
cyclical upturn in the German economy con-
tinued in the second quarter. Macroeconomic
growth is unlikely to have been as strong as
at the beginning of the year, however. There
was a visible improvement in private con-
sumption following the marked decline in the
first quarter, which was connected with the
increase in VAT. This is suggested by both theEconomic conditions in Germany*

7sales figures recorded by conventional retail
trade outlets and the greater number of carpurchases. As already mentioned, the exter-nal sector is also likely to have generated apositive contribution to growth. Investment,by contrast, was driven by the expected“technical” counter-reaction in the construc-tion sector to the favourable weather-relatedoutcome for the winter months. The positiveinfluence generated earlier by inventory in-vestment is now likely to have become mark-edly weaker.
Labour marketAgainst the backdrop of the overall favour-
able underlying trend, the spring pick-up inthe labour market was more moderate thanusual. There were, however, fewer adverseeffects during the winter months. In line withthis, according to initial estimates by the Fed-eral Statistical Office, seasonally adjustedgrowth in the number of persons in employ-ment in May was fairly small, at 8,000. Afterseasonal adjustment, the number of personsin work stood at 39.51 million. This wasequivalent to a year-on-year increase of458,000 persons. Employment subject to fullsocial security contributions grew morestrongly than employment overall in April, ie32,000 persons on the month. By contrast,the scale of government-assisted forms ofemployment remained virtually unchanged.
The decline in seasonally adjusted unemploy-
ment continued in June after a brief interrup-tion in April and May. At 3.82 million in total,there were 37,000 fewer persons registeredas unemployed than in the previous month.This was 712,000 fewer than one year earlier.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment ratefell from 9.2% to 9.1%. This was an improve-ment of 1.7 percentage points on the year.
PricesPrices in the international crude oil markets
rose somewhat more sharply again in Junefollowing a sideways movement in May. On amonthly average, spot quotations for a barrelof Brent North Sea oil stood at US$70
1/C252.T h i s
was US$23/C254more than in the previous
month. As this report went to press, the spotprice, at US$76
1/C252, was clearly above the aver-
age figure for June. The spot rate thereforewent up more strongly than the forwardrates, and the premium that was previouslyobserved on the futures market was reduced.At the end of the period under review, therewas even a discount on the spot price, whichamounted to US$1
1/C252for six-month contracts.
On long-term contracts the figure wasUS$3
1/C252.
In May, seasonally adjusted import prices in-
creased by 0.3%. Excluding energy, the in-crease was considerably smaller. Owing to anegative baseline effect in the case of energy,the cost of imports increased by “just” 0.6%on the year. Excluding energy, the figure was1.5%. As in May, seasonally adjusted indus-trial producer prices also rose quite sharply inJune (0.3%). The year-on-year rate of in-crease went up from 1.6% in April to 1.7%in June. Excluding energy, which was particu-larly expensive in the corresponding periodlast year, the year-on-year increase stood at2.8% in June, compared with 2.9% in April.Employment

8Seasonally adjusted consumer prices re-
mained unchanged in June. Energy prices
went up, but industrial goods became cheap-
er at the same time. There was hardly any in-
crease in the price of food at the end of the
period under review. The prices of services
were stable on the whole. The annual rate of
change in consumer price inflation (CPI) was
1.8%, compared with 1.9% in May. Accord-
ing to the Harmonised Index of Consumer
Prices (HICP), price inflation remained un-
changed at 2.0%.
Public finances1
Local government finances
The recently published cash statistics for the
first quarter of 2007 record a further im-
provement in the local government fiscal bal-
ance. The deficit declined year on year from
321/C252billion to 32 billion. The increase in rev-
enue remained relatively strong (+5% or
+311/C252billion). Tax revenue rose only slightly
more moderately (+71/C252%) than in the pre-
ceding quarters; in the case of local business
tax, the rise remained at 10% after deduction
of the shares accruing to other government
levels. General-purpose grants dependent on
state government tax receipts and grants
from state government earmarked for invest-
ment also increased sharply (+151/C252% overall).
By contrast, following substantial sales of
assets in some states in 2006, revenue from
asset realisations fell significantly (-26%).
After adjustment for these transactions, the
underlying revenue trend was significantly
more favourable.The increase in expenditure was again notice-
ably stronger than in the same period of last
year (+3% or + 31 billion). After a steep de-
cline in the final quarter of 2006, expenditure
on social benefits rose again (+4%). However,
a larger proportion of the accommodation
costs for recipients of unemployment benefit
II, which recently accounted for just under
one-third of all local government social ex-
penditure, is being met by central govern-
ment in the current year (31.8% on average)
than in the two preceding years (29.1%),
with the result that the fiscal burden on local
government has been growing less sharply
on balance. Other operating expenditure rose
even more sharply (+61/C252%), although most
of this growth seems to be attributable to
the budget restructuring carried out in the
local authorities of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Growth in fixed investment increased consid-
erably (+141/C252%). This may have been due
not only to the improved budgetary situation
of local government but also to the rise in
construction prices and the mild weather,
which resulted in significantly fewer construc-
tion difficulties than in the same period of last
year. By contrast, the volume of participating
interests purchased and loans granted more
than halved. Developments in staffing costs
remained subdued (-1/C252%).
1In the short report on public finances which regularly
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly Monthly Reports (published in
February, May, August and November), by contrast, con-
tain a detailed description of general government budget
trends during the preceding quarter. For detailed statistic-
al data on budgetary developments and public debt, see

analysis of trends in local government finances since

9Overall, local government is likely to achieve
significant surpluses again in 2007. The – al-
beit somewhat more moderate – increase in
tax revenue and the considerable growth in
state government transfers, which should
more than compensate for the drop-out of
the one-off effect of the sale of assets in
Dresden last year ( 31 billion), should contrib-
ute to this development. However, there is
also likely to be a sharper rise in expenditure
than in the same period of last year, owing,
not least, to a stronger expansion in fixed in-
vestment. After cash advances stabilised in
the second half of 2006 ( 3271/C252billion at
the end of the year), they increased again by
31 billion in the first quarter of 2007. It is pos-
sible that the additional bridging loans are
being used mainly to temporarily finance the
usual deficits which occur at the beginning of
the year, meaning that an erosion can be ex-
pected later on in the year. However, the fi-
nancial situation in individual local authorities
remains very strained.
Securities markets
Bond market
In May 2007, domestic debt securities with a
market value of 3103.3 billion were issued in
the German bond market. Redemptions
amounted to 373.1 billion. Thus, after taking
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of
their own bonds, German borrowers raised a
net330.7 billion in the domestic market. In
addition, foreign debt securities worth 318.4
billion were purchased; almost 314.8 billion
of these securities were denominated in euro.Funds raised in the German bond market in
May, totalling 349.0 billion, were up on the
previous month ( 317.9 billion).
The largest group of issuers in May was the
public sector, drawing on the capital market
to the amount of 313.6 billion. Central gov-
ernment issued 315.2 billion net worth of
debt securities. In the longer-term maturity
segment it issued ten-year Bunds for 36.7 bil-
lion net and 30-year Bunds for 31.6 billion
net. Also, in the medium-term maturity seg-
ment, it issued five-year Federal notes ( Bobls )
to the value of 35.0 billion and two-year Fed-
eral Treasury notes ( Sch/C228tze ) to the value of
32.1 billion while in the short-term maturity
segment it issued a small amount of Treasury
discount paper ( Bubills ) to the value of 30.1
billion. By contrast, there were net redemp-€b n

30.1 billion respectively). State government
also redeemed issues in the amount of 31.7
billion.
The credit institutions increased their capital
market debt by 312.8 billion in May 2007. In
particular, they sold other bank securities
(310.8 billion). Special credit institutions
raised 36.7 billion net from sales of their own
debt securities. By contrast, the volume of
public Pfandbriefe and mortgage Pfandbriefe
outstanding went down by 34.0 billion and
30.7 billion respectively.
In May, net sales of debt securities by domes-
tic companies in the German bond market
amounted to 34.3 billion. Sales of short-termmoney market paper accounted for more
than two-thirds ( 32.9 billion) of this amount.
Foreign investors were once again the main
purchasers of debt securities in May, building
up their German bond portfolios by 331.0 bil-
lion. German credit institutions and non-
banks bought debt securities for 311.9 billion
net and 36.1 billion net respectively.
Equity market
German enterprises issued new shares worth
30.9 billion in the domestic equity market in
May, 30.3 billion of which was attributable to
listed instruments. Sales of foreign equity se-
curities on the German market were substan-
tially higher ( 313.9 billion). On the buyers’
side, German non-banks purchased a signifi-
cant amount of shares ( 317.8 billion). In con-
trast, German credit institutions sold shares
with a total value of 31.4 billion.
Mutual fund shares
In May, domestic mutual funds saw outflows
of33.1 billion, most of which were attribut-
able to specialised funds which are open only
to institutional investors ( 33.4 billion net). In
the case of mutual funds open to the general
public, open-end real estate funds, mixed
funds, mixed securities-based funds and
money market funds raised 31 billion, 30.5
billion 30.4 billion and 30.3 billion respective-
ly. However, there were renewed outflows of
funds in the case of share-based funds ( 31.0
billion) and bond-based funds ( 30.7 billion).

11The main purchasers here were German non-
banks ( 32.5 billion) and credit institutions
(32.1 billion), whereas foreign investors pur-
chased only relatively small amounts ( 30.5 bil-
lion).
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 39.6 billion in
May. The result was thus 30.7 billion down
on the level of the previous month. Although
the trade surplus rose, the widening of the
deficit on invisible current transactions, which
comprise services, income and current trans-
fers, was greater.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade bal-
ance in May increased by 32.5 billion on the
month to 317.5 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar variations, it increased
by313/C254billion to 3171/C252billion. The value of
exports of goods fell by3/C254%. Nominal im-
ports, however, dropped even more sharply
(31/C252%). In April and May as a whole, season-
ally adjusted exports were slightly above the
average of the first quarter, while imports
decreased by 13/C254%.
Compared with April, the deficit on invisible
current transactions increased in May by 33.0
billion to 36.6 billion. The main reason for
this was that net expenditure on cross-border
income rose by 33.7 billion to 34.2 billion.
The increase in dividend payments to non-
residents was the main contributory factor to
this. In addition, the deficit on services de-Major items of the balance

12teriorated by 30.3 billion to 31.4 billion. The
deficit on current transfers, however, declined
by30.9 billion to 31.1 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment resulted in
net capital exports also in May – 37.2 billion,
compared with 315.1 billion in April. German
investors purchased a greater volume of for-
eign securities ( 337.2 billion compared with
38.7 billion in April). In so doing, in the case
of foreign shares, they switched from being
sellers ( 36.9 billion) to purchasers ( 310.7 bil-
lion). Furthermore, they increased their in-
vestment in debt securities ( 318.4 billion,
compared with 39.2 billion) – almost exclu-
sively in the form of bonds – and bought mu-
tual fund shares abroad ( 38.1 billion). At the
same time, there was strong demand from
foreign investors for German securities ( 330.0
billion net) whereas in the previous month
non-residents had sold domestic paper ( 36.4
billion). In particular, German debt securities
were sold abroad ( 331.0 billion). Further-
more, non-residents purchased money mar-
ket paper amounting to 34.8 billion. By
contrast, German equities were returned by
foreign investors ( 31.5 billion).
In the case of direct investment, at 314.4 bil-
lion net, the outflow of funds more than
doubled compared with the previous month.
The main reason for this was increased invest-ment by German enterprises abroad ( 314.0
billion). This occurred both through an in-
crease in equity capital in their subsidiaries
abroad ( 36.4 billion) and through intra-group
credits ( 36.9 billion). German parent com-
panies granted financial credits to their for-
eign subsidiaries and redeemed loans from
these subsidiaries that they had taken out
earlier. Direct investment by foreign enter-
prises in Germany was more or less in bal-
ance.
Other statistically recorded investment of
non-banks, which comprises financial and
trade credits as well as bank deposits and
other assets, recorded small outflows of
funds ( 31.2 billion). While government oper-
ations – primarily short-term bank deposits
were built up abroad – resulted in capital
exports of 312.9 billion, enterprises and
households transferred funds amounting to
311.7 billion to Germany. The banking system
closed almost in balance. Capital exports at
the Bundesbank ( 315.5 billion) – primarily in
connection with an increase in claims within
the large-value payment system TARGET –
offset the inflow of funds at the credit institu-
tions ( 314.9 billion).
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets rose – at
transaction values – by 30.7 billion in May.Portfolio

13The relationship
between monetary
developments and
the real estate marketM3 growth in the euro area has been
exceptionally strong in recent years.
Given that prices were simultaneously
comparatively stable, some observers
are therefore now calling into question
the long-term relationship between
monetary and price developments, on
which the monetary pillar of the Euro-
system’s monetary policy strategy is
based.
However, a subdued consumer price in-
flation may be quite consistent with
strong monetary growth if the devel-
opments in the asset markets are taken
into account. There are various theor-
etical reasons which argue for a close
relationship between monetary growth
and developments in the real estate
market. This can also be demonstrated
empirically by estimates that take due
account not only of the usual explana-
tory variables of a money demand
function but also developments in the
real estate market. Moreover, the ana-
lysis shows that house price increases
in some parts of the euro area have
contributed to the strong money mar-
ket growth of recent years. Conversely,
the economy’s abundant supply of li-
quidity has also influenced develop-
ments in the real estate market.

14strategy. The special consideration of monet-
ary variables is based on the generally accept-
ed view that, in the long term, “inflation is a
monetary phenomenon”, meaning that mon-
etary growth in the medium to long term is
associated with a rise in the general price
level. Owing to the strong monetary dynam-
ics in the euro area since 2001 and against
the background of subdued inflation, more
and more commentators are questioning the
continuing validity of the close money-price
relationship in the euro area that was ob-
served in the past. They maintain that the
rapid pace of monetary growth in the euro
area shows less inflationary pressure than
might be expected in the light of earlier ex-
perience. At the same time, however, it is pre-
cisely recent analyses which have also shown
that monetary indicators still have good pre-dictive properties for the inflation rate in the
euro area.1Thus, monetary aggregates con-
tinue to provide essential information regard-
ing future price developments – although the
predictive quality of some monetary indica-
tors would seem to fluctuate over time.
Generally, strong monetary growth does not
lead to a rise in consumer prices if it is accom-
panied by a matching rise in real income. In
this case, monetary growth serves the pur-
pose of offsetting the higher demand for
liquid funds that goes with the higher real in-
come. One possibility of taking this correl-
ation into account when interpreting monet-
ary developments is offered by the analysis of
the circulation velocity of money, ie the rela-
tionship between gross domestic product
(GDP) and the money stock.
A forward-looking monetary policy that is
based, among other things, on monetary
growth as an indicator of future inflation de-
velopments, is made easier if the velocity of
circulation develops in a predictable way, at
least in the longer term. The velocity of circu-
lation in the euro area has been showing a
falling trend for many years. This means that
the economic agents’ money holdings have
risen disproportionately in comparison with
GDP .2One of the reasons for this is that part

15“financing” GDP but also for wealth motives.
Until 2001, the decline in the velocity of circu-
lation was largely unproblematic from a mon-
etary policy perspective, since it followed an
easily predictable trend. Since 2001, however,
it seems very much that this trend decline in
the velocity of circulation has accelerated.
Compared with nominal GDP , a distinctly
stronger monetary growth is now observable.
With regard to potential inflation risks, this
raises the question as to whether there are
demand or supply-side reasons for the accel-
erated monetary growth that has been ob-
served since 2001. If the former is the case,
say, owing to a sustained greater preference
for liquidity on the part of the economic
agents, it is likely that the stronger monetary
growth does not constitute a risk to price sta-
bility. However, if the decline in the velocity of
circulation has supply-side causes, such as
persistently low financing costs or expansion-
ary lending, it must be assumed that the high
monetary growth rates will be accompanied
by a corresponding risk of inflation in the
medium to long term.
For a time, the heightened economic and
geopolitical uncertainties in the wake of the
terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and
the dramatic decline in stock prices between
2000 and 2003 argued for a demand-side-
driven acceleration of monetary growth in
the euro area. At that time, the response of
households and enterprises was to make ex-
tensive portfolio shifts in favour of secure and
liquid bank deposits which are part of M3.3
Since around mid-2004, however, such spe-
cial effects have no longer been fosteringmonetary growth. Instead, the monetary ex-
pansion has been driven by a marked increase
in lending. Since borrowing is linked closely
to planned expenditure, the accompanying
build-up of liquid funds points, in principle, to
price stability risks – probably to a greater
degree than the accumulation of liquidity
undertaken for precautionary reasons in the
years of extremely large portfolio shifts.
These recent – mainly credit-driven – monet-
ary dynamics cannot be explained entirely by
interest rate movements either. Traditional
money demand models that model the real
M3 stock not only as a function of real GDP
but also as a function of an interest rate vari-
able (for example, the difference between the
three-month money market rate and the re-
turn on M3 assets) likewise leave a major part
of monetary growth since 2001 unexplained.
This also seems to be the case when consider-
ing the possibility that the longstanding his-
torically low interest rate level may have
heightened the demand for liquidity on a dis-
proportionately large scale.4
The relationship between money and
wealth
An alternative approach to explaining the
sharp monetary growth incorporates devel-
opments in the asset markets. Money is a
store of value and, as such, it serves as an al-

16ternative to holding other assets such as
housing or financial wealth. As a result, high-
er wealth will prompt households and enter-
prises to hold higher money stocks, since
these are ultimately part of their respective
total assets.5No explicit consideration of this
is needed in the monetary analysis, as long as
there is a close interrelationship between
income and wealth developments, since the
impact of wealth is, so to speak, simultan-
eously captured by income. However, things
become more difficult if income and wealth
developments diverge, for example, in periods
of fairly large price fluctuations between
assets and non-durable goods. A simple an-
alysis of the money-price relationship, which
does not take explicit account of such a
development in the asset markets, then
harbours the risk of misinterpretations.Price developments in the asset markets
In actual fact, the macroeconomic develop-
ment of the past few years in many countries,
including the euro area, has been character-
ised by a very sharp increase in the price of
assets, such as real estate or shares, which
significantly outpaced the inflation of con-
sumer goods. It cannot be ruled out that this
development also has some connection with
the abundant liquidity that exists worldwide.
Many observers even see the increase in asset
prices as the result of liquidity spilling over to
certain asset markets.6
The fact that consumer goods prices have
risen on a much smaller scale than asset
prices in the past few years is also said to be
attributable to possible price-dampening ef-
fects of globalisation. The increasing integra-
tion of many emerging market economies
into the global economy has increased the
supply of trade products, intensified competi-
tion in the product markets and, thus, put
pressure on the consumer goods prices. At
the same time, the looming migration of pro-
duction plants to countries with more favour-
able labour market and production conditions
has restricted the scope for inflationary wage
increases.7The outcome of this may have
been that the ample liquidity has tended to%

that display a lower elasticity of supply. Inview of the rigid supply, the price of land is es-pecially susceptible to fluctuations in demand.In the case of shares and bonds, the price in-crease is also often said to be due to the highdemand of Asian and/or oil-exporting coun-tries for investment that promises a return.

From a monetary policy perspective, it is of
particular interest whether and to what ex-tent the rising asset prices have driven monet-
ary developments and vice versa. In particular,
the increase in house prices and, thus, hous-ing wealth may have been reflected in higher
monetary growth, since real estate transac-tions, lending and money creation are closelyrelated. For example, if there is increased ac-tivity in the real estate market, the associatedfinancing of these transactions typically leads
to increased lending. As long as the centralbank does not take countermeasures, thisinvolves money creation.
By contrast, the relationship between monet-
ary developments and other assets, such asshares or fixed-income securities, is less pro-nounced or of a more short-term nature. Oneof the reasons for this is that the relationshipbetween the developments in the securitiesmarkets and money holdings is not clear-cut.On the one hand, stock price rises tend to in-crease households’ assets, and a part of theassociated asset growth may be held in theform of money. On the other hand, high (ex-pected) securities returns make the holdingof securities more attractive than holdingmoney. This may trigger substitution effects,ie shifts from money to securities, which per
sereduce money holdings.
Relationship between real estate market
and monetary developments
On the basis of these considerations, it should
be advantageous to concentrate first on the
specific relationship between money andhousing wealth when analysing the generalrelationship between money and wealth de-velopments. This does not mean that other
assets can be neglected in the monetary ana-lysis.
9However, it may be assumed that,
owing to the more clear-cut relationship be-
tween housing wealth and money, the rela-
tionships become more apparent there than
for financial assets. The question of whetherthe real estate market developments can be
used to explain the sharp decline in the vel-ocity of circulation in the euro area in the pastfew years, ie the sharp monetary growth, istherefore to be examined below.
The special importance of real estate for
monetary developments stems mainly fromits role as important collateral when issuingbank loans (“collateralisation relationship”).Since banks are informed only incompletelyabout the quality and behaviour of their debt-ors, ie about their creditworthiness and pay-

Lecture, St. Louis, Missouri, 14 April 2005.
9In the past, it was possible to observe periods with a
distinct relationship between share prices and moneyholding. As already mentioned, the monetary dynamics
between 2001 and mid-2003, for example, were largely
shaped by households’ asset shifts from shares to more
secure, liquid forms of investment. This is also an example
of the substitution relationship between shares and
money.Relationship

18ment behaviour,10it is crucial from their point
of view whether a debtor has sufficient collat-
eral to cover the default risk. In this case, real
estate is of particular importance because it is
relatively stable in value and comparatively
objective in terms of evaluation.11An increase
in housing wealth increases the creditworthi-
ness of a borrower and thus tends to lead to
an improved availability of credit. This may
produce accelerator effects if the improved
availability of credit gives an added stimulus
to the real estate market and the resulting
house price increases make the availability of
credit even easier. In the economic literature,
this relationship is known as the “financial ac-
celerator”, since it gives a further boost, for
example, to the stimulating effect of an inter-
est rate cut owing to an expansionary monet-
ary policy or a cyclically induced rise in house
prices. Since lending and money creation are
closely linked through the banking system,
such credit channel effects also imply a close
relationship between monetary and real
estate developments.
In addition to this collateralisation relation-
ship, there exist further transmission mechan-
isms between money variables and real estate
market variables, which can be divided into
two categories. The first comprises money
demand motives (“money demand relation-
ship”), according to which monetary growth
is causally dependent on real estate market
developments. The second covers the role of
liquidity in the financing of real estate trans-
actions and, thus, the causal role of money in
the development of house prices and other
asset prices (“asset inflation relationship”). If
existing money holdings are used for acquir-ing real estate, housing wealth is influenced
through house prices.
The complex transmission mechanisms be-
tween developments in the real estate market
and money demand can be attributed mainly
to three relationships: asset, substitution and
transaction effects.12A rise in house prices in-
creases the wealth of the economic agents.
Because of this, there is a rise in demand for
the individual components of the investment
portfolio, which also includes liquid funds in
the form of money. A substitution effect may
occur if risen yield expectations in the real es-
tate sector cause the economic agents to in-
vest more in real estate at the expense of
their money holdings. However, this negative
relationship between house price develop-
ments and money holdings is likely to be only
of secondary importance. Owing to the high
transaction costs associated with acquiring
real estate, real estate would probably show a
significantly lower degree of substitution for
money than do bonds or shares, for example.
By contrast, the pure transaction aspect plays
a greater role. Rising house prices are usually
associated with increased activity in the real
estate market. The greater turnover is accom-
panied by a higher demand for transaction
balances. Thus, owing to the positive asset
and transaction effects and the likely second-

19ary importance of the substitution relation-
ship, the expected result is that the demandfor money is positively influenced by the de-velopment of house prices and housingwealth: rising house prices and rising housingwealth tend to increase the demand formoney.
In the thoughts set out above, what happens
in the real estate market was causal for mon-etary developments. In principle, however,monetary factors may, conversely, also impacton house prices and housing wealth. For ex-ample, an expansionary monetary policy canlead to an increased demand for assets, suchas real estate. A generous supply of liquiditywould thus tend to increase house pricesand, therefore, also housing wealth. In aperiod in which the supply of consumergoods is very flexible owing, for example, toan increasing international division of labouror major technical progress, there is also likelyto be a price shift between non-financial assetsand consumer goods. Especially in times ofimproving economic activity, in which suffi-cient financial resources are available, houseprices should rise in relation to the generalconsumer price index.
13
In sum, there exist complex transmission
mechanisms between monetary develop-ments and the real estate market, with the
preceding theoretical considerations, overall,
suggesting a positive relationship. Only thealready weak substitution effect appears, by
itself, to have a negative relationship.
In actual fact, the presumed positive relation-
ship is confirmed by an initial look at the data(see chart on this page). Countries with high
growth rates for house prices, such as Spain,Ireland or Greece, also show high growth
rates for real estate loans and the national
contributions to M3.

20in Germany, stagnating house prices as well
as a decidedly weak demand for real estate
loans were recorded. Moreover, Germany
contributed only to a relatively small extent to
monetary growth in the euro area. Further-
more, the national contributions to the mon-
etary growth show a greater correlation with
house prices than the national developments
in lending for house purchase. This might
suggest that not only the collateralisation re-
lationship related to lending, but generally
also the broader money demand relationship
and/or the asset inflation relationship could
be relevant.
Econometric analysis of the relationship
between money and the real estate
market
Against the backdrop of the discussion
above, two aspects, in particular, are of inter-
est concerning the empirical relationship be-
tween monetary developments and the real
estate market. First, it has to be examined
whether there is any significant correlation at
all between money and house prices or hous-
ing wealth. Second, the theoretical consider-
ations have made clear that such a correlation
may reflect differing economic relationships.
From a monetary policy perspective, the key
issues are whether monetary developments
react solely to the real estate markets,
whether monetary developments drive house
prices and housing wealth, and whether the
reinforcing effects of the collateralisation rela-
tionship are present. Fundamentally, it is also
possible that all of these causal relationships
exist simultaneously.These questions can be analysed using
econometric procedures. The empirical find-
ings clearly reveal a positive long-term rela-
tionship between M3 and house prices and/
or housing wealth. The results show that
money demand relationships play a major
role: monetary developments depend in a sig-
nificantly positive way on the real estate mar-
ket variables. By contrast, the empirical re-
sults are less clear for the asset-inflation rela-
tionship. Accordingly, no significant transmis-
sion mechanism from money to house prices
can be demonstrated for the euro area. How-
ever, with reference to housing wealth, evi-
dence for such a relationship is found. There-
fore, it cannot fundamentally be ruled out
that the monetary dynamics in the euro area
are also a causal factor for developments in
the real estate market.
While this analysis is geared mainly to the
longer-term relationship between the real
money stock and the real housing variables or
to the identification of the causal relation-
ships, the dynamic adjustment of the individ-
ual variables following a shock is also of inter-
est. The results of such a simulation based on
the econometric estimates may be represent-
ed in the form of “impulse response” func-
tions. These functions help to provide infor-
mation on the path of the respective variable
in response to changes of another variable
(see adjacent chart).15The simulations are
based on estimated VAR systems, which, in

21The relationship between money and the housing market in the euro area
The long-term relationship between monetary and
housing market dynamics in the euro area is capturedusing the following equation, which forms part of avector error correction model (VEC).

(1)M3rt¼/C110þ/C111/C1GDP tþ/C112/C1INT tþ/C113/C1I/C0Va r tþ/C15t.
M3rstands for real M3, calculated using the GDP de-
flator, while GDP trepresents real gross domestic pro-
duct and INT tis the interest return on a ten-year gov-
ernment bond. Two alternative variables were used forthe housing market variable I
/C0Va r t: the real house
prices I/C0Price tand households’ real housing wealth
I/C0Wealth t. The residual "tcaptures that part of the real
money holdings that cannot be explained by the citeddeterminants. With the exception of the interest ratevariable, all the variables were transformed into loga-rithms. The sample comprises quarterly data from thefirst quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 2006.
2
The housing market variables are based on the houseprice index of the macroeconomic database of theBank for International Settlements (BIS) and ECB esti-mates of households’ housing wealth.
3Both of the
time series which are available only on an annual basiswere converted into quarterly figures. Finally, the long-term relationship (1) is embedded in an equation sys-tem which captures the short-term adjustment pro-cesses of the observed variables. The resulting errorcorrection mechanisms, that is the reaction to devia-
tions "
tfrom the long-term equilibrium, provide valu-
able information on the directional impact among the
observed variables.
Cointegration tests show that there is a long-term rela-
tionship between these variables. The table shows theestimated coefficients of the long-term relationship as
well as the adjustment coefficients ec
t/C01of the error
correction mechanisms, both when using house prices
(middle column) and, alternatively, using housingwealth (right-hand column). The estimated parametersof the long-term relationship are all significant andshow the expected signs: an increase in GDP boostsmoney holdings and a higher interest rate lowers real
M3 owing to the higher opportunity costs of holding
money. With regard to the relationship betweenmoney and housing, two results are of particular inter-est. First, the estimation parameters of the housingvariables are, as expected, unambiguous and signifi-cantly positive. Secondly, the estimated adjustmentcoefficients of the error correction terms provide indi-cations of the causal direction of this relationship.In line with the money demand interpretation, the ad-
justment coefficients of the money equations are sig-nificantly negative for both specifications. This meansthat deviations of the money stock from its long-termequilibrium value trigger a correction process whichleads back to the equilibrium value determined by thefundamentals. Moreover, the estimates of the adjust-ment coefficients for house prices ec
I/C0Va r
t/C01and for hous-
ing wealth ecI/C0Va r
t/C01indicate that the relationship be-
tween wealth and inflation is also relevant. The corre-sponding parameter is significant only for specification(2) based on housing wealth. However, the positivesign in this case suggests that the excess liquidity – inthe sense of money holdings which are too high incomparison with the explanatory variables – increases
housing wealth. The differing results for the two speci-
fications in this estimate could be due to the fact thatthis effect was not observable in all the euro-area coun-tries and, therefore, exists only in an attenuated formwhen viewed in the aggregate analysis.

tively, real housing wealth) also consider the
real loans to the private sector as well as the
three-month money market rate. This is de-
signed to verify whether the real estate-
money relationship merely reflects the influ-
ence of loans – as assumed in the collaterali-
sation relationship – or whether there are also
independent relationships between money
and real estate, as are expressed in the
money demand relationship and in the asset
inflation relationship.
The first impulse response function shows
that, after an increase of real M3, real house
prices rise steadily for about 14 quarters and
then remain at the higher level. The confi-
dence bands, which model the statistical un-
certainty of this simulation, indicate that this
positive response of the house prices will be
statistically significant after about eight quar-
ters. The effects of monetary expansion on
house prices in the euro area thus do not
occur immediately, but they can be demon-
strated over longer horizons. By comparison,
higher real house prices lead, without a time
lag, to a significant increase in real money
holdings. The analogous simulations for
housing wealth confirm these results. All in
all, this means that the results of the error
correction analysis are largely confirmed with-
in the context of this extended model. This
suggests that there are also direct significant
interactions between money and real estate
market variables, which are independent of
developments in loans.Deviations from initial scenario as a percentage

23Real estate markets and monetary policy
The results of the empirical analysis have two
implications for the monetary analysis. First, it
may be assumed that the money demand re-
lationship in the euro area and, therefore, the
velocity of circulation remain stable if real
estate market developments are taken into
account. In an extended approach, monetary
developments can still be explained satisfac-
torily using real income, interest rates and
real estate market variables. Thus, the analyt-
ical tools of a quantifiable money demand
function and a stable velocity of circulation,
which are important in the context of the
monetary analysis, are still usable – albeit in a
modified form.
Moreover, the results indicate that real estate
market developments are significantly influ-
enced by monetary developments. In this
context, the question arises as to how and
how far house prices should be taken into
consideration by monetary policymakers. The
answer to this question depends on the pre-
cise relationship between house prices and
consumer price inflation, which is the target
variable of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy.
There are two aspects to this. One is that
there are direct statistical relationships cre-
ated by the impact that house prices have on
the cost of living. For example, if house prices
are fairly high, the cost of living also tends to
be higher – either in the form of rising hous-An empirical analysis of the
relationship between money and
the real estate market in the USA
Firstly, the analysis of US data can be used
to examine the robustness of the links be-
tween money and housing market vari-
ables found in the euro area. Secondly, the
example of the USA could provide some
clues as to the direction the relationship
between money and housing might take if
financial instruments such as are commonly
used in the US were to become more wide-
spread in the euro area. Finally, the results
for the USA are of interest, given the sig-
nificance of global liquidity developments
and their impact on the real estate mar-
kets.
The long-term relationship between mone-
tary and real estate market developments
in the USA is specified in much the same
way as for the euro area.1The results of the
estimation are even clearer than the find-
ings for the euro area. Thus, a long-term
relationship between the money stock and
housing market variables exists for the USA
as well. Moreover, it is possible to identify
clearly not only a money demand relation-
ship but also an asset inflation relationship.
Real estate prices and housing wealth are
both influenced significantly by monetary
developments, ie excess liquidity drives the
real estate markets.
Overall, it may be concluded that the rela-
tionship between money and the real es-
tate market is not a phenomenon that is
confined to the euro area.

24ing rents or in the form of rising acquisition
costs of owner-occupied housing.16
Second, there are indirect relationships. For
example, increased housing wealth may in-
crease demand for consumption and invest-
ment and thus influence consumer prices.17
As described above, this can be accounted
for by the collateralisation relationship, where
rising house prices facilitate access to loans
that can be used for consumption and invest-
ment spending. Moreover, an increase in
housing wealth may also have the effect that
economic agents consider themselves richer
overall and therefore increase their consump-
tion spending.
These relationships have implications for
monetary policy. First, they influence the
monetary policy transmission process – mon-
etary policy measures may exert their effects
on price developments through house prices
and through housing wealth as well.18Fur-
thermore, an excessive increase in house
prices may weaken financial stability, which
ultimately would also be associated with
negative implications for aggregate demandand the stability of consumer prices in the
euro area. The ongoing analysis of growth in
lending and monetary aggregates combined
with asset price developments can provide
important clues as to whether such financial
imbalances are building up.
Both implications make it advisable for cen-
tral banks to increase rather than scale back
their research in the area of monetary analy-
sis. It is only in this way that they will be able
to take better account of the complex recip-
rocal medium to long-term transmission rela-
tionships between real economic activity, on
the one hand, and money market and finan-
cial market dynamics, on the other.
16This makes it advisable to take house prices into ac-
count when calculating the consumer price index. How-
ever, owner-occupied housing has so far not been in-
cluded in the HICP . Only housing rents are recorded. This
is for technical data reasons, although it is problematic
from a monetary policy perspective, since this means that
the prices for the durable “owner-occupied housing” are
not considered when measuring inflation in the euro-
area HICP .

25Trends in local
government finances
since 2000At first glance, the budgetary situation
of local government in Germany cur-
rently appears to be significantly better
than that of central and state govern-
ment. 2006 closed with a local govern-
ment budget surplus. Nevertheless,
amid sharp divergences between indi-
vidual local governments, in many cases
a considerable need for fiscal consolida-
tion persists in order to comply with the
more rigorous local government
budgetary rules. Thus concepts to safe-
guard budgetary stringency often have
to be submitted, while high outstand-
ing cash advances are placing severe
restrictions on budgetary leeway.
Overall, the outsourcing of entities and
the emergence of public-private part-
nerships has made it more difficult to
assess fiscal developments. It is particu-
larly important that this does not give
rise to any incalculable risks which ul-
timately have to be borne by the public
sector. The changeover from cameralis-
tic cash-based accounting to commer-
cial accounting, which has been set in
train, should simplify the assessment
process provided that activities are re-
corded in a uniform and transparent
way. The availability of consolidated
data on local government yields and
costs, including outsourced entities, will
at least generally make it easier to im-
prove efficiency and to focus govern-
ment activities on specific aims as well
as to aid budgetary consolidation.

26Overall financial situation of local
government
The budgetary development of local govern-
ment1has varied considerably over the past
few years, which was mainly attributable to
large fluctuations in tax revenue (see also
table on page 34). In 2000 – as in the two
previous years – the budgets had a positive
fiscal balance (+ 32 billion). However, in the
following year, local government began re-
cording a deficit and this grew to 38 billion in
2003, thereby almost matching the peak of
the early 1990s. The financial situation then
improved gradually again and last year, at 33
billion, a marked surplus was achieved.
In spite of this recent favourable develop-
ment, the budgetary situation of a number of
local governments remains highly tense.
While the fiscal balance is a key target vari-
able for central and state government, the
situation for local government is more com-
plex, especially owing to special budgetary
rules.2Thus, in most states, approval must be
obtained from a supervisory body for budget-
ary borrowing that is intended for the long-
term financing of expected deficits (ie over a
period of decades) as a result of investment
expenditure. However, this is usually only
granted if the local government in question is
likely to generate enough revenue to cover
this additional incurrence of debt. In the cam-
eralistic system, the benchmark for assessing
this is the capability of generating the sur-
pluses stipulated in the administrative
budget, that is the budget in which current
revenue and expenditure is recorded. The
minimum surplus to be generated is mainlycalculated from the scheduled repayments of
maturing loans. Given financing based on
matching maturities, the repayment of credit
thus mirrors the ongoing consumption of
fixed assets. If a local government cannot
demonstrate the required revenue-earning
capacity, its scope for budgetary borrowing is
thus extremely limited. It then has to forgo
planned investments if it is unable to finance
these investments itself from, say, revenue
from fees. Therefore, even if a local govern-
ment has a financial surplus, this does not ne-
cessarily mean that its budgetary situation is
free of tension or that it enjoys a large degree
of budgetary leeway.
The overall development of cash advances re-
veals the actual tension in local government
finances. These loans, which were originally
only intended to bridge short-term liquidity
shortages, are now being used in many cases
to bridge funding gaps in current expenditure
for longer periods of time. At the end of
1999, local government reported outstanding
cash advances of 36 billion. At the end of
2002, this figure had risen to 3101/C252billion. In
the following years, the increase accelerated
sharply to reach over 3271/C252billion by mid-
2006. Although, according to the quarterly
cash statistics, the total volume did not grow
any further up to the end of last year, the

sults statistics.

27large variation in financial developments in
the individual local governments implies thatthe situation may have deteriorated further insome cases.
As a rule, when preparing the annual admin-
istrative budgets, local governments mustensure that budgets remain balanced afterdeduction of the required minimum sur-pluses. If they do not conform to this, thenthey must submit a concept to safeguardbudgetary stringency showing how they in-tend to achieve a balanced administrativebudget, at least in the mid-term. If this provesto be out of reach, the regional supervisoryauthority is generally obliged to withholdapproval. The municipalities in question arethereafter in a state of preliminary budgetmanagement and are essentially allowed toexpend money only on activities to whichthey are obligated. A large number of localgovernments are currently in this position.

The amount of debt incurred per capita as a
result of cash advances varies greatly, how-
ever. The highest amounts were recorded by
local government in Saarland, Rhineland-
Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia at theend of 2006. Moreover, their fiscal balances
were also still negative and their state govern-ment budgets recorded above-average def-icits. At the other end of the scale, the lowestbridging loans on average were reported bylocal government in Baden-W/C252rttemberg,
Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia, where the un-adjusted fiscal balances were also more posi-tive than the average and the situation ofstate government finances was more favour-able. This link between cash advances and fis-cal balances may be coincidental but it high-
lights regional problems. However, there are
also considerable variations within individualstates, predominantly owing to sometimesmassive differences in the per capita tax-
raising potential.
While the amount of cash advances gives an
indication of the local government budgetarysituation, the extent of credit market debt isnot suitable for this purpose. This is due notonly to the approval preconditions by the€b n

28supervisory body, which can lead to local gov-
ernments with greater financial strength
being more highly indebted, but also to the
greatly varying degree to which service en-
tities have been outsourced from the core
budgets. If the service entities in question
were also assigned liabilities, these are no
longer recorded automatically in the financial
statistics for local government budgets at the
current end, even if local governments man-
age the outsourced entities directly and are
ultimately responsible for the liabilities of
these entities. The challenge is to incorporate
those outsourced entities which still belong
to the government sector. Simply adding on
the debts of all local government holdings
may well overstate the burdens on future
budgets.4While central and state government are now
again largely managing to adhere to the pre-
scribed borrowing limits following the extra-
ordinarily sharp growth of tax revenue, many
local governments still have to repay the cash
advances that they have accumulated over
the last few years. This has a knock-on short-
term effect of noticeably restricting their
budgetary leeway even though local govern-
ments as a whole are currently generating
surpluses. In the final analysis, however, local€ per capita

29government budgetary rules are far better
suited to averting a long-term overburdening
of the budget by debt servicing than are the
current provisions for central and state gov-
ernment because they more effectively con-
strain wealth consumption. While interest
expenditure only accounted for 3 % of total
expenditure by local government in 2006,
central and state government recorded much
higher values at 13 % and 8 % respectively.
The obligation to offset an overshooting of
budgetary limits using surpluses in subse-
quent years and ultimately also to take due
account of the consumption of fixed assets
has contributed to keeping local government
debt within far narrower bounds.
Development of revenue
Over the past few years the financial develop-
ment of local government has been largely
determined by influences from the revenue
side. Between 2000 and 2003, revenue de-
creased by 36 billion or an annual average of
11/C252%. In the following three years, it rose
continuously by almost 318 billion or 4 %
each year. This was predominantly due to tax
revenue (see chart on this page) and to state
government transfers, which are mainly
linked to revenue from joint taxes. At over
361 billion or two-fifths of the total proceeds
for 2006, tax receipts were the most signifi-
cant source of revenue for local government.
Up until 2003, there was an initial notable
decline in tax revenue but this has since
grown at a much stronger pace by an annual
average of 91/C252%.Revenue from local business tax in particular
has proved to be very volatile in spite of the
fact that the tax rate multipliers set by local
governments were broadly stable. In 2000,
after deduction of the local business tax
shares transferable to central and state gov-
ernment, local government was left with
3191/C252billion. Three years later, this figure
amounted to only 315 billion. This was partly
due to the decision to raise the transfer
shares as part of the tax reform in 2000,
which meant that the actual amount payable
to central and state government went up by
9 percentage points.5Owing to the strained

30Volatility of local government tax revenue
Revenue from local government taxes is subject to
sharp fluctuations which are due primarily to the
large share of revenue from local business tax,
which is very volatile. This share has actually in-
creased in recent years. In order to stabilise the rev-
enue from local government taxes, it is sometimes
suggested that the relative weight of local business
tax should be reduced in favour of other types of
tax with a more stable revenue development. A re-
weighting of this nature is, however, associated
with various complications. For example, in addi-
tion to the overall effect on local government tax
revenue, the influence on the individual local gov-
ernment budgets also has to be taken into consid-
eration. Furthermore, according to the constitution,
local government self-regulation notably comprises
a source of tax revenue for the municipalities, in-
cluding the right to adjust local tax rate multipliers,
based on the economic performance of local trade
and industry (Article 28 (2) of the Basic Law).1
Nevertheless, to give an idea of the intensity of fluc-
tuation of local government tax revenue and of the
contribution of local business tax to the volatility,
two computations are made here. Firstly, the tem-
porary influences on the growth of local govern-
ment tax revenue are roughly estimated and, sec-
ondly, a hypothetical shift away from local business
tax towards more stable types of tax is calculated
for local government as a whole. These computa-
tions were based on the period from 1997 to 2006,
which appears to approximately encompass a rev-
enue cycle. It was also assumed that, given the
sharp growth in recent years, the income raised
from local business tax in 2006 was higher than its
medium-term level.
To assess the scale of the temporary fluctuations in
local government tax revenue, cyclical components
can be determined for the individual types of taxes.
There were also very significant fluctuations in the
revenue from local business tax over the past few
years which could not be explained by the trend in
entrepreneurial and property income, which is used
as a standardised assessment base in the cyclical ad-
justment process, or by legislative changes.The bulk of these fluctuations appear to be tempor-
ary deviations from a medium-term trend which are
not captured as a cyclical influence using standard-
ised procedures. These temporary deviations are
reflected in the residuals of the disaggregated fra-
mework for analysing public finances which was de-
veloped by the European System of Central Banks.
On the basis of these deviations, an additional tem-
porary influence on local government revenue can
be determined which significantly exceeds the in-
fluence of the cyclical component (see chart on
page 31).2
In order to assess the stabilising effect which a re-
weighting towards other types of tax would have
had and to illustrate the relative volatility of local
business tax, the revenue raised from local business
tax is hypothetically replaced by greater shares of
turnover tax and income tax. Turnover and income
tax shares were selected in such a way that, in 2006,
tax revenue was equal to the status quo and the
growth in revenue from local government taxes
over the period from 1997 to 2006 was retained
after adjustment for legislative changes. The shares
are currently around 2% of turnover tax, 15% of
wage and assessed income tax and 12% of with-
holding tax on income. The hypothetical shares ac-
count for around 10% of turnover tax und 281/C252%
of the different types of income taxes.
It turns out that under such a reweighting, tax rev-
enues would have flowed much more steadily after
adjustment for legislative changes and, in particu-
lar, the sharp drop in the years 2000 to 2003 would
have been milder (see chart on page 31). Under the
status quo scenario, the overall temporary influ-
ences reached a high of 55 billion in 1999 before
falling by around 581/C252billion and reaching a low in
2003. This corresponds to a significant part of the
deterioration of the local government fiscal balance
from 52.2 billion in 1999 to - 58 billion in 2003. By
contrast, the temporary influences in the hypotheti-
cal scenario of a shift towards turnover tax and in-
come tax results in a significantly narrower fluctua-
tion band of between + 51 billion and - 511/C252billion.
1One concept for replacing local business tax was pro-
posed by the Stiftung Marktwirtschaft, for example: Tax
Legislation Committee (Kommission “Steuergesetzbuch”) –
fiscal policy programme, 30 January 2006. Misgivings
about such a change were expressed, inter alia, by a na-
tional organisation of municipalities (Deutscher St/C228dtetag)
in its Executive Committee resolution of 20 September
2005. — 2For cyclical adjustment and the disaggregated
approach see: Deutsche Bundesbank, A disaggregatedframework for analysing public finances: Germany’s fiscal
track record between 2000 and 2005, Monthly Report,
March 2006, p 61 ff. The additional temporary effect is
derived by adding up the share of local authorities in the
residuals. A medium-term standard level has to be defined
(partly founded on expectations of future developments).
Its choice, however, has no influence on the fluctuations
and their range.

31fer shares were, however, brought back
down to below the 2000 level from 2004onwards. The 35
1/C252billion upsurge in net
revenue that year, however, was only partly
attributable to this and to the effect of legis-
lative changes (in particular, reducing the abil-
ity to offset losses for tax purposes), whichcaused revenue to rise on balance. The robust
revenue growth continued until 2006 andmost recently resulted in net revenue of328
1/C252billion, which clearly surpassed not
only the low of 2003 but also the previous
peak from the change of the millennium. The
fluctuations in net revenue described above
and the sharp average increase were predom-inantly triggered by the development of gross
revenue from local business tax. According tocentral government estimates, the effect oflegislative changes on gross revenue was al-most always positive for the years between2000 and 2006 and per se explains an aver-
age annual increase in revenue of 3 % for this
period (ie half of the total growth in the sameperiod). From 2000 to 2003 actual gross rev-enue, after adjustment for legislativechanges, developed at a far weaker pacethan entrepreneurial and property income,which is generally used as an indicator for thetax assessment base. Since 2004, however,revenue has enjoyed much stronger growth.

Given the considerable fluctuations in rev-
enue from local business tax, local govern-ments need to build up reserves from sur-
pluses during more favourable phases to be
able to cope with subsequent weaker phaseswithout having to take major procyclical
countermeasures (see box on page 30). How-€b n

32ever, past experience has shown that this has
only been done in exceptional cases. There-
fore, the idea of replacing local business tax
with a less volatile levy, which has been
repeatedly discussed, appears a promising
avenue.
The proceeds from local government’s share
of income tax also initially suffered a clear de-
cline. After 3211/C252billion in 2000, only 3181/C252
billion was recorded in 2005, primarily owing
to successive tax cuts. Last year this revenue
grew again and reached 320 billion, mainly as
a result of the sharp increase in revenue from
assessed income tax. In contrast, proceeds
from real property taxes rose relatively stead-
ily from 38 billion in 2000 to 391/C252billion in
2006. Approximately half of the annual 21/C252%
increase is accounted for by the development
of the average tax rate multipliers for tax on
land and buildings not used for agricultural
purposes (Grundsteuer B) , which rose by a
total of 25 points to 392 % in the period be-
tween 2000 and 2005.7With revenue of ap-
proximately 321/C252billion, local government’s
share of just over 2 % in the proceeds from
turnover tax, introduced in 1998 to compen-
sate for abolishing local tax on business cap-
ital, showed hardly any growth. Other muni-
cipal taxes, such as dog tax and hunting tax,
generated only low levels of revenue.
As was the case with local government’s tax
revenue, state government transfers – which
largely track the development of revenue
from joint taxes – likewise initially declined
during the period under review. Starting at
352 billion in 2000, these transfers fell signifi-
cantly to 349 billion by 2003 while revenuefrom joint taxes decreased by almost twice as
much. The contribution of state transfers to-
wards stabilising local government finances,
however, was still rather limited on the whole
(see box on page 33). By 2006, the total
amount had climbed back up to 355 billion
mainly because, from 2005, the share of ac-
commodation costs for benefit recipients
taken on by central government as part of
the amalgamation of unemployment assist-
ance and social assistance8was paid to local
government via the state government
budgets. In addition to these funds, which
amounted to a total of 34 billion at the end
of the reporting period (including payments
of over 31/C252billion to the city-states), state
government has committed itself to passing
on to local government any savings made in
the area of housing allowances as a result of
the reform, which are estimated to total ap-
proximately 32 billion per year.9If these spe-
cial factors are excluded, state government
transfers declined by approximately 321/C252bil-
lion over the period from 2000 to 2006.
At3431/C252billion in 2006, other revenue col-
lected by local government from fees, asset
realisations (in particular, sale of building
land), business activities (in particular, licence
fees from public utilities) and other sources
(for example, refunds of social benefits, fines
and interest income) was 31 billion lower

33than in 2000. This is largely attributable to an
almost continuous decline in revenue from
fees. At 316 billion in 2006, this type of rev-
enue was over 31 billion lower than in 2000.
In times when the financial situation is tense,
local governments are generally obliged to
levy fees to cover their costs and thus pass on
any cost increases to the users. However, any
such increases in fees were more than offset
by outsourcing service entities from core local
government budgets.10The financial statistics
do not show the extent to which the closure
of fee-levying entities requiring grants, such
as swimming pools and libraries, eg as part of
concepts to safeguard budgetary stringency,
has contributed to this decline.
Development of expenditure
Total local government expenditure rose by
less than 1% per year on average from 2000
to 2004. However, in 2005, the pace of
growth accelerated to almost 3 % before
slowing to 11/C252% last year. The recent larger
increases were triggered by the effects of the
2005 labour market reform but these were
counterbalanced by additional transfers re-
ceived of around 3 % of local government
expenditure on balance. The fact that the
increase in expenditure was nevertheless still
moderate on the whole is explained not only
by the relatively strict provisions for local gov-
ernment budgets but also by the outsourcing
of service entities from the core budgets. AsStabilisation of revenue through
transfers from state government
For the funding of local government,
alongside the revenue from non-personal
taxes and a share in the proceeds from
turnover tax and income tax, Article 106
of the Basic Law also envisages a propor-
tion of state government revenue from
taxes raised jointly with central govern-
ment, which is set by the state parlia-
ment. In addition, state taxes can also
be included in the tax-revenue-sharing
schemes with local government and, for
instance, for the purpose of revenue-
sharing, levies imposed on the non-
personal tax revenue and revenue from
local government shares in income tax
and turnover tax. The municipalities re-
ceive resources linked to the level of tax
revenue, in particular, in the form of
transfers reflecting local revenue capa-
city shortcomings ( Schl/C252sselzuweisun-
gen). Differences between the disburse-
ment of the transfers on the basis of tax
estimates and the amount actually pay-
able according to the final tax revenue
outturn are normally settled in subse-
quent years. Rhineland-Palatinate guar-
antees its local governments certain
minimum transfers irrespective of the de-
velopment of its tax revenue. Any trans-
fers over and above the payments from
the tax revenue-sharing scheme are only
granted as a loan and are later offset
against higher tax revenue. Such an addi-
tional stabilising mechanism is advanta-
geous for local government, as this
means that a procyclical policy can be
more easily avoided. However, if state
government borrows credit to grant
loans and does not redeem this credit
when the account is later settled with
local government, the level of debt is sys-
tematically increased.

35only the need for grants is still being budget-
ed for, the volume of expenditure is reducedby the amount of revenue that the out-sourced entities generate themselves. Assum-ing revenue from fees grows in line with theprice development for public services only,annual growth in expenditure would havebeen 0.4 percentage point higher on average.
Personnel expenditure by local government
increased by an annual average of
1/C252% be-
tween 2000 and 2006 to 3401/C252billion. This
increase resulted purely from payments for
civil servant pensions, supplementary pension
schemes for salaried employees and civil ser-
vant healthcare subsidies. Despite somewhathigher social contributions and additional
cost burdens from pay rises by an average of1
1/C252% per year, expenditure for current staff
decreased slightly. This is attributable to sig-
nificant staff cuts (in full-time equivalents) by
an annual average of 21/C252% (up to 2005).
However, this is not due to greater productiv-
ity and reductions in the scope of activities
alone but also reflects the outsourcing of en-
tities whose personnel expenditure has beenrebooked in the financial statistics under
transfers to enterprises (which rose by 6
1/C252%
per year between 2000 and 2006) or pur-
chases of services. No doubt partly because
of this, other operating expenditure also in-
creased at an above-average rate of 2 % peryear to 332 billion over the same period.
Higher prices for energy and a greater re-
course to so-called public-private partnerships(PPP) have probably also had a part to play inthis development. Under PPP schemes, pri-vate entities generally take on the operation,
building as well as the credit financing of es-sentially local government entities, meaningthat current expenditure on services may alsoreplace investment expenditure and interestpayments.
Up until the end of 2004, local government
expenditure on social benefits notably in-cluded payments pursuant to the Federal Acton Social Assistance ( Bundessozialhilfege-
setz), which comprised subsistence benefits,
assistance granted in particular circum-stances,
11assistance for young people in and
outside of institutions as well as benefits for
war victims and benefits granted to persons
seeking asylum. From 2003, the Act stipulat-
ing a needs-based basic allowance for elderlypersons and for people with reduced earning
capacity ( Gesetz /C252ber eine bedarfsorientierte
Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbs-minderung ) established a new, independent
social benefit provided by local governmententailing additional cost burdens of around
3
1/C252billion per year, which is, by and large,
the same as subsistence benefit but is grant-
ed with fewer restrictions.
Local government expenditure on social
benefits went up over the period from 2000to 2004 from 326
1/C252billion to 332 billion
(+5 % on annual average).12Broken down ac-
11Subsistence benefits comprise ongoing benefits as
well as measures promoting a return to work (grants to
employers and employees, public work schemes and re-
integration measures). Assistance granted in particular
circumstances is made up of nursing assistance, reinte-
gration assistance for disabled people, assistance in the
case of illness and other forms of assistance.
12After deducting refunds, the increase amounted to
over 341/C252billion (+41/C252% pa). Refunds comprise receipts
from other social service providers (statutory health,
long-term care, old-age pension and unemployment in-
surance schemes) as well as transferred claims on persons
liable to pay maintenance under civil law.Personnel

36cording to benefit components, sharp in-
creases were recorded for payments for social
assistance in institutions (from 310 billion to
3121/C252billion or +5 % pa) and for assistance
for young people outside of institutions (to
32 billion or +6% pa). Expenditure on social
assistance outside of institutions grew in pro-
portion to the increase in the number of re-
cipients by 2 % on average per year (from
391/C252billion to 3101/C252billion). However, after
taking account of the basic allowance for eld-
erly persons and for people with reduced
earning capacity that was introduced in
2003, for which over 311/C252billion was paid in
2004, the increase was only slightly smaller
than that of social assistance in institutions.
Only expenditure on persons seeking asylum
recorded a perceptible decline (to 31 billion).Following the labour market reform in 2005,
local government, either together with the
local employment agencies or on its own,
took on responsibility for recipients of the
new unemployment benefit II who had previ-
ously received mainly unemployment assist-
ance or social assistance. Local government
became responsible, in particular, for the
costs of accommodation and heating which
were previously paid as part of social assist-
ance or, in part, as statutory housing allow-
ances.13Central government contributes to

tunity to take over the remaining tasks with regards to
the labour market reform, such as paying unemployment

cipalities with separate responsibility for the un-

37321/C252billion per year. Initially a contribution
share of 29.1% was set for this which was
then raised to an average of 31.8 % for 2007
and scaled according to state.14In addition to
the contribution from central government, it
has been agreed that the states will pass on
any savings that they make as a result of the
reform to local government.
Owing to the amalgamation of unemploy-
ment and social assistance for persons able to
work, local government expenditure on social
benefits initially shot up by 331/C252billion to
3351/C252billion (+10 %) in 2005 and by a fur-
ther31 billion in 2006. Adjusted for the new
refunds from central and state government
and other (declining) revenue for other social
benefits, this resulted on balance in a total
additional cost burden for social benefits of
31 billion compared to 2004. Taking into ac-
count the probably substantial net cost relief
for personnel and administration and com-
paring the result with the estimated develop-
ment had the previous legal status quo
persisted, this is likely to have resulted in
considerable cost relief for local government
overall.15
The development of investment expenditure
over the last few years was shaped by the
tense budgetary situation in many local gov-
ernments. With a total volume of 3181/C252bil-
lion, payments for investment in fixed assets
in 2005 were 36 billion lower than in 2000,
which corresponds to an average annual de-
cline of 51/C252%. Evidently, many local govern-
ments were not able to provide the proof
that their revenue-generating ability was suf-
ficient. This proof is required under budgetaryrules in almost all states before taking up
additional loans for investment purposes.
However, with some marked budgetary sur-
pluses, local governments, especially those in
south German states, were able to signifi-
cantly augment their investments in fixed
assets last year, resulting in a nationwide
increase of 21/C252%. The decrease in local gov-
ernment investment over the past few years
was, however, probably noticeably overstated
owing to the outsourcing mentioned
above.16Public-private partnerships have also
played a role in this of late. In the case of
such PPPs, prior local government investment
is reclassified as private investment (hence
not being recorded in the budgets) which is
then used by local government for a fee.
Developments in the east German federal
states
While state budgets in eastern Germany have
far greater per capita revenue than those in
western Germany, on account of the special
14In 2007, central government is contributing 35.2%
towards accommodation costs in Baden-W/C252rttemberg,
41.2% in Rhineland-Palatinate and 31.2 % in the other
states. This scaling of payments is intended to help cor-
rect the larger-than-average burdens on local govern-
ment in these two federal states. Up until 2010, adjust-
ments are only to be made based on formulas.

16It has been established for the municipalities in North
Rhine-Westphalia that in 2003 enterprises and off-
budget institutions managed by local government alone
financed approximately three-quarters of the volume of
investment in fixed assets in the core budgets. Including
investment by municipally owned enterprises, this almost
matched the volume in the core budgets. See M Junkern-
heinrich (2007), loc cit. As no information is currently
available about the development over time, however, it is
not possible to estimate the contribution made by out-
sourcing to the decline in investment in fixed assets
reported by local government.Expenditure

38supplementary Federal grants, local govern-
ments in eastern Germany currently do not
have this kind of advantage. If the one-off
proceeds from the sale of the Dresden hous-
ing company ( 31 billion), which were posted
last year, are stripped out, per capita revenue
and expenditure were both around 95 % of
the level in western Germany. The ratio for
revenue was thus 1 percentage point higher
than in 2000. However, it cannot be inferred
from this comparative gap that the financial
position of east German municipalities really
was more strained than that of their west
German counterparts, mainly because both
the distribution of tasks between state and
local government and the outsourcing of en-
tities from core budgets differs from state to
state. It should also be taken into consider-
ation on the expenditure side that, overall,the price level (for example, for wage costs or
service charges) is likely to be lower on aver-
age in eastern Germany.
Local government tax revenue ( per capita )
has increased at a somewhat faster pace in
eastern Germany than in western Germany.
Whereas in 2000, eastern Germany recorded
only 40 % of the level in western Germany,
this had increased to 48 % in 2006. While the
gap is still very wide, it is more than evened
out by per capita state government transfers
that are almost twice as high.
In terms of expenditure, personnel costs per
capita were reduced significantly compared
with moderate growth in staff costs in west-
ern Germany. This had the effect of lowering
the per capita expenditure for the period
from 2000 to 2006 from 1061/C252%t o9 7 %o f
the average amount in western Germany.
However, the higher level of civil servant pen-
sions in west German municipalities also has
to be taken into consideration in this context.
The comparable figure for current staff was
still surpassed by 81/C252% in eastern Germany
(after +201/C252% six years previously). Between
2000 and 2005, the headcount was reduced
by an annual average of 61/C252%, while local
government jobs were cut at an annual rate
of 11/C252% in western Germany. At the same
time, pay scales were raised further towards
the west German level. While in 2000 only
861/C252% of the west German level was paid,
since July 2006 this figure has been at
951/C252%. As the municipal workforce per
capita , expressed in full-time equivalents, was
still 131/C252% above the average in western
Germany in mid-2005, there may well still beas a percentage of the level in
western Germany, per capita

39a need for further adjustment in this area, es-
pecially so as to avoid east German local gov-ernment budgets being overburdened by thecontinuing alignment of pay scales. Thereare, of course, differences between the indi-vidual east German states, although thesemay, in part, be a result of the varying distri-bution of tasks between state and local gov-ernment. Local governments in Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, in particular, have asizeable workforce. By contrast, Saxony andThuringia are much closer to the west Ger-man reference figures.
While east German local governments record-
ed increasingly lower per capita other operat-
ing expenditure compared to western Ger-many, the increase in social benefits has beenmuch stronger in eastern Germany over thelast few years. The 2005 labour market re-form is likely to have been the chief cause ofthis. Taking on responsibility for costs of ac-commodation and heating also for thosepeople entitled to claim the former un-employment assistance has placed a particu-larly heavy burden on local government ineastern Germany. However, a special pay-ment of 31 billion per year to east German
states was agreed as part of the reform,which comes near to offsetting the additionalcosts that these states have to bear vis-/C224-vis
west German municipalities.
However, the fact that per capita investment
in fixed assets by local government is still no-
ticeably higher in eastern Germany indicates
that further progress was achieved in catch-ing-up with regards to the provision of infra-structure over the last few years. Neverthe-less, expenditure in eastern Germany is now
not as far ahead of western Germany as itwas six years ago. Thus whereas constructioninvestment was 56 % ahead of western Ger-many in 2000, this figure had narrowed to44 % in 2006, with a large portion of thisprobably due to measures taken to overcomethe flood damage caused in summer 2002.The procurement of movable assets and,above all, the acquisition of real estate was,however, much lower than by local govern-
ment in western Germany, with the resultthat overall investment in fixed assets in 2006was 22
1/C252% higher than in western Germany
(after 32 % in 2000). From 2009, the special
supplementary Federal grants paid to east
German states, part of which they pass on to
local government, will be reduced more per-ceptibly. East German municipalities will beas a percentage of the level

40Extension and funding of child day care
Recently, the issue of additional day care places for chil-
dren under three years old and the funding for this has
been the subject of heated debate. Child day care is, as
part of public assistance for young people pursuant to
the Eighth Book of the Social Security Code, a duty of
state and local government, which they are also responsi-
ble for funding. Day care facilities are provided, on the
one hand, by churches and religious groups and welfare
associations (independent providers) and, on the other
hand, by district authorities, independently administered
cities and – if decreed by the state legislation – also muni-
cipalities belonging to a district and regional authorities
like the state youth welfare offices (public providers).
Since 1996, children have had the right to a place in a
child day care facility from when they have reached the
age of three until they start school (section 24 (1) of the
Eighth Book of the Social Security Code), and the avail-
able capacity has been correspondingly increased. How-
ever, for children under three, particularly in western Ger-
many, considerably less capacity is offered. Under the Act
on extending child day care provision ( Tagesbetreuungs-
ausbaugesetz ), which came into force in 2005, in addition
to the 100,000 places that existed in western Germany
at the end of 2002, a further 230,000 child care places
for infants are to be created by the end of 2010. The
investment required was estimated at 521/C252billion and the
annual running costs from 2011 were estimated at 513/C254
billion. 511/C252billion of the 521/C252billion promised to relieve
local government budgets in the 2005 labour market
reform should, in the long term, be invested for these
purposes.
In contrast to western Germany, in eastern Germany the
strong decline in the birth rate, in particular, has for years
considerably reduced the demand and thus, given the
comprehensive care capacity that already existed there,
the expenditure. Overall, however, there were consider-
able differences between individual state governments
regarding expenditure, which, in particular, reflected the
different scope of day care facilities that was offered. The
proportion of children under three who attended a day
care facility in 2006 varied from 50% in Saxony-Anhalt in
eastern Germany to 5% in Lower Saxony in western Ger-
many.
In April 2007, central government, the state governments
and the central organisations representing local govern-
ment agreed to extend the number of day care places for
children under three to such an extent, that in 2013, on
average, 35% of children in this age group will be offered
a place. To this end, the number of places throughout
Germany is to almost treble, from 285,000 in March 2006
to around 750,000 places. It is understood that then chil-
dren are to have a right to a day care place once they
have reached the age of one. However, the level of costs
and the contribution of central government to the fund-
ing are the subject of dispute. While the Federal Govern-
ment estimates the investment costs for an additional
300,000 places vis-/C224-vis the provision envisaged in the
Act on extending child day care provision will amount to
531/C252billion and the later additional annual running costs
to52 billion, local governments expect a greater burden(55 billion with regards to investment and 53 billion for
running costs). The Federal Government intends to make
a contribution of one-third of the additional expenditure
which it estimates will, in total, be 512 billion up until
2013. For the time thereafter, it declared its intention to
continue to assume a share of the additional running
costs, without being more specific.
In general, an assumption of part of the costs by central
government is made more difficult by the fact that the
constitutional framework of the German public finance
system does not allow direct financial relations between
central government and local government. In accordance
with the reform of the federal structure, which did not
come into force until September 2006, in addition, central
government may no longer assign tasks to local govern-
ment (Article 84 (1) seventh sentence of the Basic Law).
Only state governments have the right to do this and
then, in accordance with the respective connectivity rules,
they must also refund the costs. In this respect, the possi-
bility of central government assistance towards financing
the extension of day care provision is restricted to the
granting of temporary investment subsidies to state gov-
ernment, pursuant to Article 104b of the Basic Law, for
the purpose of promoting economic growth. In the case
of such mixed financing, however, the incentive effects
have to be taken into account. The granting of central
government aid to cover a proportion of the investment
costs seems unlikely to be conducive towards achieving a
cost-effective implementation of the planned extensions
in capacity at local level. Alternatively, assigning addi-
tional shares in turnover tax revenue to state government
would appear to be a promising idea. In this way, the
higher current running costs could also be offset. State
government would have to use these financial resources
to cover its cost compensation obligations where state
law obliges local government to provide the day care
places necessary to meet the entitlement to day care.
By contrast, the Federal Ministry of Finance is planning to
set up a capital-consuming special fund, funded out of
the current higher tax revenue, to finance the extension
of day nurseries. In addition, issuing parents with care
vouchers is being considered as a possible central govern-
ment grant for the additional running costs, although
these vouchers would only cover a small part of the total
costs. Vouchers could, as a general rule, have a positive
steering effect, as experience in some municipalities and
abroad shows. However, owing to state government op-
position to such a model, in the meantime, reallocating
turnover tax revenue from central government to state
government is also being considered. However, it appears
that no agreement has yet been reached which gives state
government the freedom of scope required under consti-
tutional law with regard to refunding local government
outlays. In addition, advance funding of central govern-
ment’s contribution from the present higher tax revenue
by means of a special fund – regardless of the aims of the
revised rules on the constitutional framework of the Ger-
man public finance system – is not without problems, par-
ticularly in view of the budgetary principles of unity and
transparency.

41confronted with an extensive need for adjust-
ment if this cannot be offset by further
increasing their tax-generating potential.
Outlook
The currently favourable macroeconomic set-
ting is having a positive effect on local gov-
ernment finances, too. This takes the form of
a further clear increase in revenue from in-
come tax shares in 2007 as well as robust
growth in revenue-linked transfers from state
government, which inter alia will pass on a
portion of its additional revenue from raising
the standard rate of turnover tax.17The May
tax estimate predicts that income from local
business tax, following the upsurge in the
past few years, will still show a slight im-
provement despite the denting effect on rev-
enue of the temporary extension of the ap-
plicable degressive depreciation method. On
the spending side, personnel expenditure
may well decrease slightly owing to expected
ongoing staff cuts and to moderate pay rises
overall. The significant reduction in the num-
ber of persons unemployed and benefit re-
strictions in connection with unemployment
benefit II are likely to curb spending on social
benefits and thus provide a counterweight to
the aspired extension of childcare for infants
(see box on page 40). Expenditure for invest-
ment in fixed assets is expected to grow more
strongly owing to the improvement in the
overall financial situation of local govern-
ment, but also to the extra cost resulting
from the rise in the standard rate of turnover
tax and to current sharp increases in net con-
struction prices. On the whole, local govern-ment budgets are expected to conclude 2007
with a positive fiscal balance. However, it may
well be some time before the deficits in the
administrative budgets, which have accumu-
lated in numerous local governments over
the course of the past few years, have been
offset in line with the legal requirement.
In view of the significant financing surplus ex-
pected, the solution agreed upon for the
2008 business tax reform of limiting revenue
shortfalls for local government to just under
31 billion in the first year appears to be finan-
cially viable, even if repercussions from the
tax revenue-sharing agreement with state
government may cause the cost burden to in-
crease somewhat. In the mid-term, additional
revenue is actually expected for local govern-
ment. The large estimation risk with regard to
the exact impact on revenue must be taken
into account, however. The accompanying
structural vulnerability of local business tax
proceeds could be mitigated by a switch from
including half of the interest on long-term
debt to including a more broadly defined
range of debt financing costs, which would
have almost no effect on revenue. However,
the underlying problem of the extreme fluctu-
ations in local government revenue, in par-
ticular as a result of the dependency on vola-
tile revenue from local business tax (see box
on page 30) has not been resolved. Past ex-
perience has shown that investments in the
public infrastructure, which are predominant-
ly financed from local government budgets,
are greatly affected by these fluctuations in

42Deutsche BundesbankChangeover to double-entry bookkeeping
In November 2003, the state government inter-
ior ministers adopted guidelines for the change-
over of local government budgets to a commer-
cial double-entry bookkeeping system. The con-
crete implementation of the new accounting
system is the responsibility of each state parlia-
ment. North Rhine-Westphalia is taking the lead
in this respect; the Act introducing the new
local government financial management system
(Gesetz zur Einf/C252hrung des Neuen Kommunalen
Finanzmanagements f/C252r Gemeinden ) passed by
this state at the end of 2004 stipulates that the
switch must be complete by 2009. In some other
federal states, the changeover may take place
much later; in Bavaria, which has many quite
small municipalities, even an option to continue
using the current cameralistic budget manage-
ment system was granted. In order to take the
European and national reporting requirements
into account and to be able to aggregate the
results of the different accounting systems – in-
cluding during the transitional period – the stat-
istical offices were involved in defining new
standard products and accounts. However, the
provisions since passed by the state parliaments
partly differ considerably from this standard.
There is therefore a danger that the financial
statistics data for local government will become
significantly less meaningful overall.
The cameralistic accounting system focuses on
payment flows and thus tends to conceal, in par-
ticular, costs that do not result in outgoing pay-
ments until later reporting periods. By contrast,
in the double-entry bookkeeping system, allyields and costs that are attributable to a given
period must be recorded in the crucial profit and
loss account. One key difference for local gov-
ernment in terms of the budget management
requirements is that it is no longer necessary for
due redemptions, which can be steered through
the choice of loan maturities, to be financed
from regular revenue. Rather the actual re-
sources consumed in a given period as mirrored
by depreciation have to be matched by yields.
Furthermore, in the case of staffing costs, it is no
longer pension payments but the additional pro-
visions for current staff that must be covered.
Pension payments are now redemptions and are
not to be recorded as a cost item.
Whether the requirements for a balanced
budget are stricter than in the cameralistic sys-
tem depends largely on whether depreciation
and increases in provisions are greater than re-
demption commitments and pension payments.
Alongside possible maturity mismatches con-
cerning credit-financed investments, it should
be noted that a significant proportion of assets,
such as real property and participating interests,
are not usually subject to depreciation charges
but can be credit-financed and associated with
redemption commitments. Fears on the part of
many local authorities that their radius of
budgetary action will be narrowed may prove
unfounded.
The details of the accounting rules, which differ
from state to state, also have a bearing on this.
If valuation of assets at fair value is permitted,

DEUTSCHE
BUNDESBANK

43the balance sheet values and the associated de-
preciation charges in double-entry bookkeeping
typically exceed those based on historical acqui-
sition costs. By contrast, achieving a balanced
budget is made easier if, alongside regular
yields, proceeds from the realisation of hidden
reserves through asset disposals can be used to
cover costs. In addition, North Rhine-Westphalia
has also introduced an offsetting reserve. One-
third of the equity capital (up to one-third of an-
nual tax revenue plus transfers received) can be
placed in this reserve, from which deficits may
be financed without further restrictions with re-
gards to preserving the equity base. With these
regulations, North Rhine-Westphalia is easing
the changeover to the new accounting system
for those municipalities that are facing a tight fi-
nancial situation. However, to a certain degree
this conflicts with the aim of protecting the
interests of future generations through a com-
mitment to offset all current costs. This will also
be reflected on the balance sheet, where not
only assets but also liabilities and equity capital
have to be valued. Overall, it is expected that
the municipalities’ opening balance sheets will
record sizeable amounts of equity capital. In the
event of lax budgetary rules under the system of
double-entry bookkeeping, the depletion of the
capital base could even be made easier.
One frequently perceived important advantage
of double-entry bookkeeping is that the process
of consolidating the results of core budgets and
their participating interests, eg in the form of
municipally owned enterprises, is made consid-erably easier through the use of a uniform ac-
counting system. It is hoped that this will also
lead to improved management of the portfolio
of participating interests, which has become in-
creasingly opaque over the past few years owing
to the hiving-off of entities from the balance
sheet. From a statistical perspective, it is import-
ant to achieve a correct demarcation in the con-
solidation process between government entities
and market-oriented enterprises. A crucial criter-
ion in this respect, besides the degree of cost
recovery through charges, is decision-making
autonomy of the entities concerned.
However, the management of core budgets is
also to be improved. While, in the cameralistic
system, attempts are made to achieve political
aims by allocating funds to individual budget
items, in double-entry bookkeeping, products
are defined whose production costs have to be
calculated. The scope of supply must then be de-
termined by the local parliament. The funding
required is authorised in the budget. This pro-
vides a clear picture for politicians and the gen-
eral public alike of the costs associated with the
desired volume of services. This facilitates com-
parisons of cost efficiency between fiscal years
and also between individual local authorities
and can help to contain costs. Although in many
cases improvements in management operations
will, on their own, fall a long way short of pro-
viding a rapid solution to the continuing
budgetary problems experienced by many local
authorities, the remaining consolidation poten-
tial should be easier to identify and exploit.

44revenue. As the proposal to replace local busi-
ness tax with, say, shares in income tax and
corporation tax, with a surcharge option, are
meeting with stiff political resistance, it may
be worth considering at least steadying the
level of state government transfers so as to
shift the impact of cyclical swings to a higher
level.18Easing the local government debt
incurrence rules certainly offers no solution to
the problem. The curbing of the interest bur-
den which was achieved over the last few
decades, also as a result of the relatively strict
rules, has in fact opened up long-term
budgetary leeway and lessened incentive
problems, which it was feared would arise if
excessive debt could be shifted to other gov-
ernment entities. To tighten the link between
local government services and the financing
of these services, it appears worthwhile to
consider giving local government greater
scope to set different tax rates, which would
then have to be justified by the local govern-
ment in question.
The changeover of local government budgets
to double-entry bookkeeping shifts the focus
to maintaining wealth and ensuring that the
management of authorities heads for per-
formance objectives. Costs associated with
the changeover could essentially soon be bal-
anced out by a more efficient provision of ser-
vices. However, it is important that when es-tablishing the legal framework, state parlia-
ments take account of these aims and also
the need for well-defined statistical informa-
tion (see box on pages 42 and 43 on the
introduction of double-entry bookkeeping).
The same is also true for public-private part-
nerships. Without details about the scope of
these agreements, it is much more difficult to
make statements about the development of
public infrastructure. Basically, PPPs can be a
promising way of improving infrastructure –
initial reports indicate cost savings of more
than one-tenth in some cases and faster pro-
ject completion than under conventional ap-
proaches. However, it must be made clear
which risks remain with the public sector. The
long-term nature of the contractual specifica-
tions is another factor that has to be taken
into consideration. The regional supervisory
body faces the challenge of preventing a po-
tential misuse of such models to bypass bor-
rowing limits. Finally, it is crucial that, in the
context of the emerging changes in account-
ing methods and financing forms, local gov-
ernment’s activities and obligations are trans-
parent, comprehensible and manageable.
18Despite numerous demands to abolish local business
tax and replace it with a standard company tax, this was
not taken on board in the latest reform of business tax-
ation. Steadying the revenue flow by expanding business
tax elements which are unrelated to earnings is problem-
atic both in terms of tax principle and also with regard to
the likely implications for investment decisions.Changeover of

The primary market is firmly tied to
Germany physically through the Fed-

trast, are open across borders and thus
subject to far greater competition,
which is determined by the efficiency
of national market infrastructures;
these markets are therefore not so de-

competing trading systems have estab-

46terms, on time and cost-effectively, and to
manage the total outstanding debt. Govern-
ment debt management authorities thereby
decide on the product range and are also re-
sponsible for defining the creditor target
groups, the marketability, the type of interest
rate, the type of placement and the currency
of issue. They also decide on the introduction
of new instruments, such as foreign currency
bonds or inflation-indexed bonds, and on the
use of financial derivatives.1
Germany’s Federal Ministry of Finance is re-
sponsible for managing the German Federal
Government’s debt. Since June 2001, most of
the government debt management activities
on the market have been assumed by the pri-
vate sector “Bundesrepublik Deutschland –
Finanzagentur GmbH” (the “German Finance
Agency”, which was established in Septem-
ber 2000). The Bundesbank is involved in the
issuance of government paper by conducting
auctions of tradable Federal securities on be-
half of the German Finance Agency and for
the account of the Federal Government, par-
ticipating in sales of Federal tap issues and
carrying out market management operations
for Federal securities on German stock ex-
changes.
The primary market for public sector debt
instruments
At the end of December 2006, the public sec-
tor debt instruments in circulation had a total
nominal worth of around 31,135 billion. Of
these instruments, some 81% (approximately
3917 billion worth) were issued by the Fed-eral Government and its special funds, around
19% (approximately 3216 billion worth) by
the Federal states and less than 0.05%
(around 30.4 billion worth) by local govern-
ments.2This article will examine only the pri-
mary and secondary markets for securities
issued by the Federal Government.3
The Federal Government’s prominent position
in the capital market is predicated on its first-
class credit rating – which must be guaran-
teed by a reliable budgetary policy for which
Parliament is responsible – as well as an issu-
ing structure that meets the requirements of
the market, an efficient primary market and
the existence of liquid and transparent sec-
ondary markets. Federal Government secur-
ities encompass a broad range of maturities
with no-credit-risk investment opportunities.4

have been in the short to medium-term
range; however, bonds with original matur-

bonds (Bunds), five-year Federal notes (Bobls), Federal
Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) and Treasury discount paper
(Bubills)) and tap issues (Federal Treasury financing paper
and Federal savings notes); the state governments issue
old-style Treasury notes, state government bonds and
new-style state Treasury notes. For some years now, the
Federal states have taken large-volume joint issues
(“L/C228nderjumbos”) to the market to amass sufficient mar-
ket liquidity through scale effects. These state issues are
generally placed by a bank syndicate. Municipalities, too,
issue a smaller volume of securities.

In the past few years, the Federal Govern-
ment has expanded its range of debt instru-ments.
5For instance, in May 2005 it issued its
first US dollar-denominated foreign currency
bond, totalling US$5 billion. In March 2006,
an inflation-indexed bond was issued for the
first time; the initial volume of 35.5 billion
was subsequently topped up to 311 billion in
two stages.6Moreover, there are plans to cre-
ate a complete yield curve based on the yields
of the “Bund linker” outstanding as a coun-
terpart to the nominal Federal Government
paper through regular new issues at one totwo-year intervals. Several strategic goals can
be pursued in issuing inflation-indexedbonds. Creating an additional liquid marketsegment increases flexibility in covering fund-
ing needs. Diversifying the product range also
opens the doors to a new investor base, espe-cially abroad, whose growing appetite forfirst-class inflation-indexed bonds had hither-to been satisfied by other countries.

nance Agency has been able – through the
use of interest rate swaps8– to control the
duration and interest rate fixation9of the

This enables the issuing strategy to be de-

In doing so, it also heeds investors’ demands.

the chart on p 49 is the weighted average maturity of all
payment flows from a bond. It is a key determinant of a
bond’s interest rate sensitivity.
10The German Finance Agency measures its success – in
the form of cost savings and additional revenue – using
two portfolios: a “reference portfolio” and the current
debt portfolio. The reference portfolio reproduces the
borrowing principles applied by the Federal Ministry of Fi-
nance prior to the establishment of the German Finance
Agency without using the new instruments now avail-
able. The reference portfolio is based on the debt struc-
ture as at 31 December 2001. The current debt portfolio
also includes the use of interest rate swaps, repo transac-
tions and securities lending.

49portfolio without having to change the ma-
turity structure of the Federal securities.
The successful issuance of Federal securities
requires not only market-based terms butalso effective issuance procedures. The Fed-eral Government uses a variety of placementprocedures for its individual Federal securitiesdepending on whether the target group inthe primary market is made up of institutionalinvestors or individuals. Prior to the start ofan issuance year, the Federal Governmentissues an overview for the year in which it an-nounces the planned new issues and reopen-ings. In addition, it publishes a quarterly issu-ance calendar, which contains more detailedinformation such as the auction dates andprecise maturity dates of the issues. In thisway the Federal Government accommodatesthe capital market’s interest in transparencyand the ability to plan in advance.
11
Federal bonds (Bunds), five-year Federal
notes (Bobls), Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze)and Treasury discount paper (Bubills) are is-
sued through a tender procedure. This is the
Federal Government’s key channel for obtain-ing funding.
12Only members of the Bund
Issues Auction Group ( Bietergruppe Bundes-
emissionen ) are eligible to participate directly
in the Federal Government’s auctions. TheAuction Group currently comprises 33 creditinstitutions, securities trading banks and se-
curities trading firms. At the end of each year,the German Finance Agency publishes a rank-ing list of bidders’ maturity-weighted sharesin the allotted issue amounts. This ranking listis important insofar as the German Finance
Agency – for further transactions such asswaps or the awarding of mandates to issue
bonds in the syndicate procedure – gives pref-erence to higher-ranking members of the
Auction Group. Interested financial institu-tions may apply for membership at anytime.

50banks which assume predefined obligations,
especially in the secondary market.
Since April 2005, the Federal Government’s
auctions have been conducted on the web-
based auction platform “Bund Bidding Sys-
tem” (BBS) developed by the Bundesbank
in cooperation with the German Finance
Agency.14In compliance with strict security
requirements, BBS enables the Federal Gov-
ernment’s auctions to be conducted quickly,
easily and in a stable manner. BBS is open to
both domestic and foreign bidders. The ac-
cess requirements are identical and the appli-
cation is available in German and English.
In each auction of Federal securities, a portion
of the issue is withheld for market manage-
ment purposes. The total volume of an issue
is therefore composed of the amount allotted
to the members of the Auction Group and
the market management portion. This market
management portion is initially held by the
Federal Government itself. Its amount is set
when the tender is allotted according to the
current liquidity requirement and the existing
tender bid structure. The market manage-
ment portion is subsequently placed in the
market by the German Finance Agency via
electronic trading platforms and also by the
Bundesbank in floor trading on Germany’s
seven stock exchanges. This channelling-in of
the market management portion needs to be
distinguished from those market activities of
the German Finance Agency and the Bundes-
bank which are designed to avoid short-term
price fluctuations in the secondary market
through smoothing purchases or sales on the
stock exchanges.Their trading activities give the German Fi-
nance Agency and the Bundesbank a per-
manent market presence and enable them to
make an important contribution to securing
liquidity in the market for Federal securities.
On average over the past eight years, around
20% of the relevant trading on all German
stock exchanges was accounted for by the
Bundesbank’s market management activities,
of which about 60% took place on the Frank-
furt Stock Exchange. In absolute terms, how-
ever, the Bundesbank’s market management
activities on the stock exchanges have de-
clined significantly in favour of similar oper-
ations by the German Finance Agency using
electronic trading.
Federal tap issues (Federal savings notes and
Federal Treasury financing paper) are offered
for sale on market-based terms both through
credit institutions and directly by the German
Finance Agency.15Individuals are the main
target group. Retail business, however, makes
up only a small share of the Federal Govern-
ment’s borrowing, amounting to only around
2% in 2006. A distinct growth of the retail
business segment in the medium term is
envisaged, however.
14BBS replaced the “Automated Bidding System” (ABS)
which operated more slowly owing to its e-mail-based
communication with bidders, was available only in Ger-
man and was not accessible from other countries.

task, merged with the German Finance Agency on 1 Au-

51Secondary markets for public sector debt
instruments and futures markets
The secondary market plays a key role in the
competitiveness of public sector debt instru-
ments. The existence of an efficient second-
ary trading system is a major precondition for
the successful placement of Federal securities
in the primary market. The vast majority of in-
vestors will provide issuers with capital only if
it is ensured that subsequent portfolio adjust-
ments can be made at any time at low cost.
The futures market, and especially futures
trading, also play a key complementary role
for secondary market trading in public sector
debt instruments. Their highly liquid nature as
well as their near-perfect correlation with
spot price movements means that the risks of
the securities holdings can be reallocated at
low transaction costs. By buying or selling fu-
tures contracts as appropriate, investors can
adjust the risk-return position of their secur-
ities portfolio at any time without having to
execute any securities transactions.
According to a recent study, the Federal Re-
public of Germany’s securities issues – with a
daily average trading volume of 325 billion
(single-counting16) in the secondary market –
are the most important segment of the Euro-
pean bond market.17
Secondary trading in Federal securities has a
key signalling function for the financial and
goods markets.
– In the euro area, the Federal Govern-
ment’s medium to long-term bonds serve
as benchmarks; they are regularly takeninto account for price quotations and for
guaranteeing the prices of fixed-income
securities with comparable maturities
issued by other parties.18

ing in the credit market in Europe are cur-Principle of double-counting1

18In the one to three-year maturity range, however, Ital-
ian and French government bonds serve as benchmarks.
The significance of Federal bonds is reflected inter alia in
the Bloomberg/EFFAS Government Bond Index (August
2006), which gives Germany a 26.06% weighting in the
composition of the index for the seven to ten-year seg-
ment, followed by France at 19.79%. In the five to
seven-year segment, the weighting is 24.39% (France:
18.73%); in the three to five-year segment 28.75%

52rently determined to a large extent by the
level of interest on Federal bonds, the con-
ditions in the secondary market are ultim-
ately also relevant to real economic deci-
sions concerning production and invest-
ment.
– The highly liquid secondary market, where
new information is rapidly translated into
market yields, reduces the yield mark-up
demanded by market participants for fric-
tion in price formation and the trading
process (the “liquidity premium”) and
thus helps the Federal Government to
obtain funding at favourable terms.
– Federal Government bonds are important
hedging instruments.Federal securities are traded both on stock ex-
changes and over-the-counter (OTC) both in
Germany and abroad.19Exchange trading
takes places exclusively on German stock ex-
changes. They are organised as auction mar-
kets in which market participants’ buy and
sell orders are entered into a central order
book (auxiliary ledger) and matched on the
market. The volume of exchange trading in
Federal debt instruments – compared with
OTC transactions – is relatively small, how-
ever.
In exchange trading, the Bundesbank is the
most important partner for institutional in-
vestors and banks.20In 2006, the stock ex-
change turnover in public sector bonds
amounted to 3311.6 billion: a total of 381.6
billion (of which the Frankfurt Stock Ex-
change accounted for 332.4 billion) was at-
tributable to the Bundesbank’s market man-
agement activities on German stock ex-
changes. Although public sector debt and
thus the amount of Federal securities out-
standing has grown considerably in the past
few years, the turnover in public sector bonds
on stock exchanges has dropped below the
level of turnover in OTC trade.
The majority of transactions in public sector
debt instruments are conducted over-the-

20Trades with a volume of more than 310 million are
rare on German stock exchanges. This threshold value is
probably attributable to the Bundesbank’ s market man-

53pants. According to Bundesbank calculations,
the OTC secondary trade volume made uparound 98% of all secondary trading in Fed-eral securities in 2006. Unlike auction-basedexchange trading, OTC secondary trading inpublic sector debt instruments is a decentral-ised inter-dealer market without fixed tradinghours.
For decades, OTC bond trading was conduct-
ed exclusively over the telephone. This in-volved negotiating and executing deals inEuropean government bonds either bilaterallyor through voice brokers. Only over the pastfew years have electronic trading systemsbegun to prevail in both client business andthe interbank markets. According to a recentstudy, telephone dealing accounts for 50% ofthe OTC trading volume in European govern-ment bonds.
21The long period of reluctance
to engage in electronic fixed income bond
trading with an open order book can be ex-
plained partly by the fact that, although elec-
tronic trading increases transparency – givensufficient liquidity – it also reduces profit mar-
gins. The traded government bonds are main-ly standardised products listed on stock ex-changes; the trading of large volumes of suchbonds (block transactions) through normalexchange trading or a transparent OTC elec-
tronic platform would entail undesirableinformation and price effects.
22In addition,
bilateral telephone dealing enables contracts
to be individually tailored.
Electronic trading systems (MTFs)23are be-
coming increasingly important alongside tele-
phone trading. Highly transparent pricing is
one of the defining features of electronic sys-tems; counterparties’ anonymity is guaran-
teed until the transaction is concluded.Liquidity is ensured through the market mak-ing activities of major investment banksagreed pursuant to private law. With the aidof standard information systems, market par-
ticipants know what prices are being quotedby the individual market makers at all times.Electronic trading platforms now also allowlarge-volume orders to be executed in amarket-smoothing manner through dealing
with these orders in stages. Electronic tradingplatforms enable the exploitation of majoreconomies of scale and cost advantages;Principle of double-counting

Eurex Bonds GmbH, the MTS Group and the
(Deutsche Bank’s) Autobahn trading platform
are some of the key electronic platforms on
which bonds, including German government
bonds, are traded.24The German-Swiss finan-
cial futures exchange, Eurex (together with
11 European bond trading firms as further
partners) has been operating its own elec-
tronic trading platform for bonds (Eurex
Bonds GmbH) since October 2000.25Eurex
Bonds also enables institutional investors to
conduct integrated spot and futures market
trading in the form of “basis trades”.26The
trading volumes on Eurex Bonds in all types
of securities (single-counting) reached a total
of around 3151 billion in 2006, of which justunder 3120 billion was accounted for by trad-
ing in Federal securities.
Dealers have the option of placing what are
known as “iceberg orders” in which prede-
fined tranches of a complete order are grad-
ually presented in the system for public view.
This enables block orders to be performed in
an automated and market-smoothing man-
ner. Counterparties are completely anonym-
ous. Participants obtain an insight into the
market regarding prices and volumes because
the ten best bid/ask rates with aggregated
volumes are visible in the central order book
at all times. (The above-mentioned “iceberg
orders” are an exception.) Since mid-2003, it
has been possible to enter into the system
trades which have not been channelled
through the central order book but have in-
stead been concluded bilaterally outside the
platform (“pre-arranged trades”). These
trades are settled via the clearing house and
thus sheltered from risk. Such transactions ac-
count for around 50% of Eurex Bonds trans-
actions. Eurex Clearing AG acts as the central
counterparty here. Trading on Eurex BondsPrinciple of single-counting

The electronic trading system MTS SpA (Mer-
cato Telematico dei Titoli di Stato) was initiallyestablished for Italian government bonds in
1988 and then gradually extended to cover
government bonds from other countries, in-cluding Federal bonds. MTS has grown into a
cross-border electronic platform for trading infixed-income bonds in Europe. The MTSGroup consists of EuroMTS as a “wholesaletrade market” for significant European gov-ernment bonds and national MTS markets
which jointly share a single technical plat-form. In Germany, MTS also operates theinternet-based BondVision trading platform,on which especially institutional investors, in-cluding hedge funds, investment funds, com-mercial banks and also central banks operate.
MTS likewise offers the option of breaking
down large trading orders through “icebergorders” in which only a fraction of the wholeorder is visible in the order book. However,MTS lacks some of the applications offeredby Eurex Bonds, such as integrated basistrading. The German Finance Agency alsotrades Treasury discount paper (Bubills) andinflation-indexed bonds via MTS. The volumeof Federal securities traded via the MTSGroup has tended to rise. In 2006, it amount-ed to 3227.9 billion, of which 3117.1 billion
was traded via MTS Germany, 327.1 billion
via EuroMTS and 383.7 billion via BondVision
(single-counting). The MTS Group’s prepon-derance compared with Eurex Bonds is prob-ably attributable, among other things, to theconsiderably larger group of participants.Trading in Federal securities accounted for7.7% of the total volume of all securitiestraded via the MTS Group in 2006 ( 32,948.4
billion).
Since 1996, Deutsche Bank has been operat-
ing an electronic bond trading system called“Autobahn”. This system allows institutionalinvestors, banks and central banks to viewthe tradable prices of more than 7,000 bondsin real time. Moreover, customers can useAutobahn as a single-dealer system to tradePrinciple of single-counting

Eurex is one of the key futures exchanges for
bond futures.28The capital market futures on
German bonds traded via Eurex are all based
on fixed-income securities issued by the Fed-
eral Government. Futures on Federal secur-
ities are traded exclusively via Eurex.29There
are currently four types of bond futures con-
tracts (Euro Bund Future, Euro Bobl Future,
Euro Schatz Future and Euro BUXL Future)
which differ from one another with regard to
the maturity of the underlying Federal secur-
ity and cover the most important maturity
windows of the Bund yield curve. In 2006,
around 654 million Euro Bund Future, Euro
Bobl Future, Euro Schatz Future and Euro
BUXL Future contracts were traded via Eurex
at a value of over 373 trillion; the Euro Bund
Future alone accounted for around 49% of
the contracts traded and around 51% of the
trading volume.30The existence of these ex-
tremely liquid futures contracts is, in turn, a
decisive factor in the prime importance of
Federal securities in the spot market: Federal
securities are key basis instruments in futures
trading and are used to place margin pay-
ments on the futures exchanges. The Euro
Bund Future which is traded via Eurex serves
as a benchmark for the European futures
market.Repo trading has grown sharply in the past
few years.31At the end of 2006, the total vol-
ume of repos outstanding in Europe was just
under 36.4 trillion. Around 24% of the secur-
ities in the European repo market are
German-issued debt instruments.32Although
no information on the percentage of Federal
securities in this figure is available, these in-
struments are likely to play a key role in the
repo market owing to their high credit rating
and liquidity.
Like other types of financial markets, the repo
market is also experiencing an increase in the
importance of electronic trading platforms.
Currently, one-quarter of the total volume of
trading in the European repo market is con-
ducted via electronic trading platforms,
known as alternative trading systems (ATS).33
This trend is attributable to a series of advan-
tages held by electronic repo trading plat-
forms, such as market transparency regarding
prices and reduced settlement costs since the
28Measured in terms of traded futures contracts, Eurex
is the world’s largest futures exchange (information for
2006 in millions of contracts): Eurex (1,526), CME
(1,403), CBoT (805), CBOE (674), Liffe (497) and Euro-
next Paris (86). See Eurex, Monthly Statistics Derivatives
Market, January 2007, p 100.
29Options on futures, which are likewise traded via
Eurex, are of lesser importance and will therefore not be
discussed in this article.

31A repurchase agreement, or repo, is defined as the
sale (purchase) of securities in conjunction with the simul-
taneous obligation to repurchase (resell) the same secur-
ities at a given time. Economically speaking, a repo is a
loan backed by securities.

The primary and secondary markets in
international competition
The primary market for Federal securities is
relatively well placed to compete internation-
ally. The instruments issued by the Federal
Government cover a broad spectrum of ma-
turities and products. The large bond volumes
can be placed on the capital market without
friction. The Bund Issues Auction Group and
the Bund Bidding System provided by the
Bundesbank enable the Federal Government
to auction at competitive financing costs. Its
regular presence on the market in all maturity
segments through its market management
operations is equally important. By introdu-
cing an inflation-indexed bond and a US
dollar-denominated bond, the German capital
market is tending to become a more attractive
option – especially to foreign investors.
The market for Federal securities is one of the
largest and most liquid markets for govern-
ment bonds in Europe. Although exchange
trading of public sector debt instruments has
become less important in terms of volume, it
still has an important price signalling function.
The lion’s share of trading in Federal Govern-
ment securities is conducted over-the-counter
by means of telephone dealing. This OTC
trading – even when it involves foreign coun-
terparties – is conducted primarily at orthrough German financial centres. Another
advantage enjoyed by Germany as a trading
location is that these transactions are also
mostly settled and cleared in the country via
Deutsche B/C246rse.
Germany’s competitiveness as a financial
centre is becoming increasingly dependent on
the efficiency of the electronic trading sys-
tems in the secondary market. As a financial
centre, Germany appears to be relatively well
equipped to face this challenge. Federal se-
curities can be traded on various competing
platforms. Although this leads to a certain
fragmentation of the secondary market, it
also contributes to open market access and
enhanced competition.
The spot market for Federal securities is close-
ly interlinked with the futures and repo mar-
kets. The integration of the spot and futures
markets is facilitating the existence of a highly
liquid market for government bonds in Ger-
many. The trade in futures contracts and op-
tions on interest rate products in the euro
area has grown sharply in the past few years;
German government bonds are virtually the
only type used as underlying securities.34
Germany as a financial centre has an inte-
grated, highly efficient and internationally
well networked market infrastructure and a
broad spectrum of products in the spot and
futures markets for public sector debt instru-
ments. This means that the conditions for
maintaining a leading position in internation-
al competition are relatively good.
