Commentaries
Economic conditions
Underlying trends
After growing at a subdued rate at the begin -
ning of 2018, the German economy is likely to 
see stronger growth again in the second quar -
ter. The main reason for this is that the special 
factors which were having a dampening effect 
on overall economic activity in the first quarter 
of the year are now petering out. This is espe -
cially true of the unusually strong flu epidemic 
this year. Moreover, government consumption 
is expected to recover again after declining 
markedly in the previous quarter for the first 
time in a number of years. However, it is diffi -
cult to gauge the extent of the dampening spe -
cial factors and the resulting rebound effects in 
the current quarter. Added to this is the fact 
that the indicators are also rather mixed at the 
current end. In any case, it is unlikely that the 
pace of overall economic growth will match 
the high growth rates seen in the past year.1 
This is due mainly to the rather lacklustre devel -
opments in industry of late. Private consump -
tion, on the other hand, is likely to serve as a 
mainstay of growth on the back of the ongoing 
very positive labour market situation and the 
strong wage increases agreed in the most re -
cent wage agreements. The booming construc -
tion sector will probably also contribute to 
overall economic growth despite the ongoing 
capacity restrictions.
Industry
German industrial output fell sharply in April 
2018 in seasonally adjusted terms (-1¾%) com -
pared with the figure for March, which had 
undergone a marked upward revision. It was 
therefore also down significantly on the level of 
the first quarter. The decline was probably 
attrib utable to a “bridge day” effect and was 
therefore visible across virtually all sectors. Con -siderable production cutbacks were recorded 
in  particular by manufacturers of computers, 
optical and electronic products as well as by 
manufacturers of electrical equipment. German 
mechanical engineering firms also substantially 
scaled back their production. Motor vehicle 
manufacturers, on the other hand, recorded 
significant growth in output. In line with this, 
the production of capital goods also fell only 
slightly overall (-¼%), whereas the output of 
intermediate and consumer goods decreased 
much more sharply (-2¼% and -1¾%, respect -
ively).
Industrial orders fell steeply in April 2018 com -
pared with the previous month after adjust -
ment for seasonal variations (-2½%). Com -
pared with the average of the first three months 
of the year, the decline in new orders was even 
greater still (-3¼%). This was due mainly to the 
weak demand for industrial goods from Ger -
many (-4¼%) and, in particular, from the euro 
area (-10½%), whereas the inflow of new 
orders from non- euro area countries recorded 
a marked increase (+2¾%). Excluding the 
rather  irregular influx of new large orders, the 
overall decline was lower (-2¼%). Moreover, 
this means that the discrepancy between de -
velopments in the euro area, from which par -
ticularly few large orders were received, and 
non- euro area countries is much less pro -
nounced. Broken down by sector, the capital 
goods sector in particular (-6½%), but also the 
consumer goods industry (-1¾) saw a drop in 
demand. By contrast, producers of intermedi -
ate goods benefited from a marked increase in 
demand (+1¾%). Overall, the downward trend 
in orders received seen in the first quarter con -
tinued. The particularly sharp decline in April 
should, however, probably be seen as an out -
lier. This is suggested in any case by the fact 
that, according to the Ifo Institute, enterprises Growth

rated their orders situation significantly more 
positively in May than one month earlier and 
thus almost as favourably as in January 2018, 
when a record level was reached. In March, the 
range of orders also remained at its highest 
level since the data collection began in 2015, 
which was reached in the second half of last 
year as a result of the very buoyant inflow of 
orders. Thus, the order situation in German in -
dustry has probably remained quite favourable 
so far.
In contrast to industrial output, industrial sales 
increased slightly in April 2018 on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms and also on the aver -
age of the first quarter of 2018 (+¼%). From a 
regional perspective, strong growth in sales to 
non- euro area countries was the determining 
factor behind the positive quarter- on- quarter 
overall result. A boost was provided above all 
by the very strong motor vehicle sales. In Ger -
many and in the euro area, on the other hand, 
industrial enterprises posted significantly lower 
sales than in the first quarter. Broken down by 
sector, capital goods producers stood out with 
substantial sales growth, which was also largely 
driven by the brisk motor vehicle sales. By con -
trast, intermediate and consumer goods sales 
were clearly down on the level of the previous 
quarter. Despite the significant growth in in -
dustrial export sales, nominal exports of goods 
declined slightly on the whole in seasonally 
adjusted  terms compared with the previous 
month (-¼%). This also applies both in nominal 
and price-  adjusted terms compared with the 
average of the first quarter. Nominal imports of 
goods, on the other hand, rose sharply on the 
previous month (+2¼%). The nominal increase 
was also strong in quarter- on- quarter terms 
(+1½%). After adjustment for price effects, 
growth was only marginally weaker (+1¼%).

(+3¼%). This rise was probably due, at least in 
part, to the colder than average weather con -
ditions in the two preceding months. Output 
growth was on a similar scale to the average 
level seen in the first three months of the year. 
Activity in the main construction sector ex -
panded much more strongly (+5¾%) than in 
the finishing trades (+1¼%). Overall, the situ -
ation in the construction sector remained ex -
cellent and the construction boom is expected 
to continue. Although new orders received in 
the main construction sector in the first quarter 
of 2018 – figures are available up to then – fell 
significantly on the previous quarter (-1¾%), 
this should be seen against the backdrop of the 
very substantial rise in new orders in the final 
quarter of the previous year (+10¼%). In line 
with this, the Ifo Institute’s assessment of the 
business situation in this sector once again 
reached a new all- time high. However, the 
buoyant construction activity is being reflected 
in increasing staff shortages. Recently, for ex -
ample, the share of construction firms report -
ing production hold- ups owing to the lack of 
skilled workers clearly exceeded its previous 
peak.
Labour market
As in the previous month, the number of 
people in employment increased at a some -
what more moderate pace in April compared 
with the very strong increase previously. Em -
ployment went up by 35,000 persons on the 
month in seasonally adjusted terms. Over the 
last twelve months, total employment grew by 
592,000 persons, or 1.3%. As in the past, the 
growth in total employment was driven by the 
strong increase in jobs subject to social security 
contributions, which increased by as much as 
725,000 persons between March 2017 and 
March 2018. The number of self- employed per -
sons continued to decline. Exclusively low- paid 
part-  time employment decreased again per -
ceptibly of late after stabilising for a while. The 
Ifo employment barometer, the Federal Em -
ployment Agency’s BA-  X job index and the la -bour market barometer of the Institute for Em -
ployment Research (IAB) indicate that demand 
for labour will remain high in the coming 
months.
After seasonal adjustment, unemployment 
continued to fall slightly in May compared with 
the previous month. There were 2.36 million 
persons registered as unemployed with the 
Federal Employment Agency, 12,000 fewer 
than in April. The decline by 0.1  percentage 
point in the corresponding unemployment rate 
to 5.2% is due primarily to the annual adjust -
ment to the labour force participation rate, 
which the Federal Employment Agency uses to 
calculate the unemployment rate. Compared 
with the same month last year, there were 
182,000 fewer persons registered as un -
employed. Total underemployment showed an 
even stronger decrease as the number of per -
sons taking part in labour market policy meas -
ures was likewise in gradual decline. Although 
the unemployment component of the IAB 
labour  market barometer fell markedly of late, 
it is still slightly in positive territory. Unemploy -
ment is therefore expected to continue to con -
tract over the next three months, albeit at a 
slow pace.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued to rise markedly in 
May against the backdrop of ongoing geopol -
itical tensions and robust global demand. At 
times they reached their highest level since the 
end of 2014, and on a monthly average they 
were up 7% on their level recorded in April. 
Although  prices fell again slightly in the first 
half of June, the price of a barrel of Brent crude 
oil was still trading at just over US$75 as this 
report went to press. The discount on crude oil 
futures was US$1½ for deliveries six months 
ahead and US$3½ for deliveries 12 months 
ahead.
In April, both import and producer prices rose 
distinctly due to the sharp rise in energy prices. Employment

Excluding energy, the fall in import prices came 
to a standstill and industrial producer prices in 
domestic sales rose again slightly. The year- on- 
year figure for overall import prices moved into 
positive territory again (+0.6%) and held steady 
at around +2.0% in the case of industrial pro -
ducer prices.
Consumer prices (HICP) in May rose buoyantly 
by a seasonally adjusted 0.7%. Energy prices 
went up distinctly again as a result of the 
higher crude oil prices. Moreover, the prices for 
travel services more than made up for the 
slump in the previous month. However, there 
were hardly any price changes for other ser -
vices, including rents, nor in the case of food 
and industrial goods (excluding energy). An -
nual headline HICP inflation went up from 
+1.4% to +2.2% overall (CPI +2.2%, after 
+1.6%). Excluding energy and food, the figure 
was +1.5%, compared with +1.0%. After fac -
toring out the two volatile components of 
travel services and clothing, the rate remained 
at +1.3%. In the coming months, the overall 
rate is likely to remain at a similarly high level as 
in May.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €128.4 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in April 2018 was distinctly up on 
the previous month’s figure (€103.2 billion). 
However, after deducting redemptions and tak -
ing account of changes in issuers’ holdings of 
their own debt securities, net redemptions of 
domestic debt securities came to €12.5 billion. 
Foreign debt securities worth €3.9 billion were 
placed in the German bond market during the 
reporting month, meaning that the outstand -
ing volume of debt instruments in the German 
market decreased by €8.7 billion overall.
In April, the public sector redeemed debt secur -
ities worth €19.3 billion net. On balance, this 
was mainly attributable to central government, including the resolution agency which is classi -
fied as part of it (€19.1 billion). In the main, 
five- year Federal notes (Bobls; €28.4 billion) 
were redeemed in net terms, while the out -
standing volume of two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze; €3.8 billion) as well as ten- year 
and 30-year Federal bonds (Bunds) increased 
(€3.6 billion and €2.0 billion respectively). State 
governments redeemed  bonds to the net value 
of €0.2 billion.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt by €0.5 billion. In particular, 
they redeemed other bank securities that can 
be structured flexibly (€3.1 billion) but also, to a 
lesser extent, public Pfandbriefe (€0.6 billion). 
By contrast, debt securities issued by special -
ised credit institutions came to €3.2 billion net.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €7.2 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with €0.8 billion one month earlier. 
On balance, the majority of these were bonds 
with maturities of more than one year. The bulk 
of bonds issued was attributable to financial 
corporations (without a banking licence).
In April, domestic non- banks and the Bundes -
bank were the main actors on the buyers’ side. 
The former bought bonds worth €5.7 billion 
net, with interest focused primarily on foreign 
paper, on balance. The Bundesbank acquired 
debt securities worth €5.2 billion net, chiefly 
under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
grammes, displaying an almost exclusive inter -
est in domestic paper issued by the public sec -
tor. This contrasted with net sales by non-  
resident investors and domestic credit institu -
tions to the tune of €16.9 billion and €2.6 
billion respectively.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €3.2 billion net in the 
German equity market, with the volume of for -
eign equities in the German market falling by No further

€1.6 billion over the same period. Foreign in -
vestors were the most active purchasers, 
adding equities in the value of €2.9 billion to 
their portfolios. Domestic non- banks expanded 
their share portfolio by €1.3 billion in net terms, 
while domestic credit institutions sold shares 
worth €2.5 billion net.
Mutual funds
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded mod -
erate inflows of €8.4 billion net. On balance, 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestor (€6.5 billion) were the primary benefi -
ciaries. Among the asset classes, mixed 
securities- based funds, in particular, engaged in 
selling new shares (€4.1 billion). However, 
bond- based funds (€3.4 billion) and open- end 
real estate funds (€1.2 billion) recorded inflows 
as well. By contrast, equity funds redeemed 
their own shares (€1.6 billion). The outstanding 
volume of foreign mutual fund shares distrib -
uted in Germany increased by €0.2 billion dur -
ing the reporting month. German non- banks 
were virtually the sole net buyers of mutual 
fund shares in April (€10.5 billion). Domestic 
credit institutions added mutual fund shares 
worth €1.0 billion net to their portfolios, while 
foreign investors parted with German mutual 
fund shares worth €2.9 billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €22.7 billion in April 2018, putting it €7.0 
billion below the March level. This was partly 
driven by a decrease in the goods account sur -
plus and a narrowed invisible current transac -
tions balance, comprising services as well as 
primary and secondary income.
In the month under review, the surplus on the 
goods account was down on the month, fall -
ing by €3.4 billion to €22.5 billion. In this con -
text, exports of goods fell more sharply than 
imports.In April, the surplus on invisible current transac -
tions fell by €3.6 billion to €0.2 billion. This was 
attributable to the decline in net receipts in the 
primary income account, which also more than 
offset the reduced deficit in the secondary in -
come account. Meanwhile, net receipts on pri -
mary income dropped by €5.1 billion to €3.5 
billion, mainly as a result of higher dividend 
payments to non- residents. In particular, the re -
sulting increase in general government revenue 
from current taxes on income and wealth also 
helped to narrow the deficit in the secondary 
income account by €1.4 billion to €2.7 billion. 
Compared with its previous level of €0.8 billion 
in March, the deficit in the services account 
remained  virtually unchanged at €0.7 billion, 
with both sides of the balance sheet contract -
ing by roughly the same amount. On the rev -
enue side, other business services and financial 
services proved of particular importance while, 
on the expenditure side, lower expenditure on 
travel played a key role.German mutual

Amid the Eurosystem’s expected unwavering 
adherence to its monetary policy and reduced 
volatility in the financial markets, German 
cross- border portfolio investment recorded net 
capital exports in the amount of €18.6 billion in 
April, compared with net capital imports total -
ling €3.8 billion in March. This was mainly due 
to the fact that foreign investors parted with 
German securities to the tune of €17.0 billion 
net, disposing of a large volume of German 
– exclusively public – bonds (€17.2 billion), but 
also of mutual fund shares (€2.9 billion), whilst 
adding shares to their portfolios (€2.9 billion). 
By contrast, domestic investors acquired for -
eign secur  ities (€1.7 billion), buying –  mainly 
euro- denominated – bonds (€3.9 billion), while 
selling shares (€2.4 billion).
Direct investment in April likewise generated 
net capital exports, in this instance amounting 
to €12.1 billion (€13.8 billion in March). On the 
one hand, domestic enterprises supplied their 
branches abroad with a net €6.7 billion worth 
of funds, doing so by augmenting their foreign 
equity capital (€10.7 billion), while in turn shift -
ing funds back to Germany via intra- group 
lending (€3.9 billion). On the other hand, cap -
ital exports were generated by divestment on 
the part of foreign investors in Germany (€5.3 
billion). Though foreign companies increased 
their equity stakes in Germany (€1.3 billion), 
capital outflows through intra- group lending 
(€6.6 billion), not least in the shape of repay -
ment of previously granted trade credits, had a 
greater impact on developments.
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank 
deposits  and other investments, registered net 
capital imports of €4.2 billion in April (as 
opposed  to net capital exports of €14.4 billion 
one month previously). Non- banks recorded 
capital outflows totalling €1.4 billion, with cap -
ital exports generated by the activities of enter -
prises and households amounting to €4.2 bil -
lion, while general government’s capital im -
ports came to €2.8 billion. The banking system, Shift in portfolio

Outlook for the German economy – 
macroeconomic  projections  
for 2018 and 2019 and an outlook for 2020
The economic boom in Germany is likely to persist over the projection horizon. The already high 
level of capacity utilisation is increasing, although economic expansion is unlikely to be quite as 
strong as a year earlier. Growth in exports and business investment will be less strong. In add -
ition, the rising shortage of skilled workers is increasingly dampening employment growth. Des -
pite significantly stronger wage dynamics, this is acting to brake the rise in households’ dispos -
able incomes, which reduces the underlying momentum of private consumption. By contrast, 
aggregate demand overall will be supported by expansionary fiscal measures, particularly in the 
coming year. All in all, the projection paints a picture of an ongoing economic boom, in which 
increasing supply- side bottlenecks are reflected in strong wage growth and in higher domestic 
inflation. This higher inflation will, however, initially be reflected mainly in the booming construc -
tion industry and will only gradually translate into rising core inflation at the consumer level.
In this scenario, calendar- adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) could grow by 2.0% this 
year, 1.9% next year and 1.6% in 2020. Aggregate capacity utilisation, already well above nor -
mal levels last year, would therefore rise distinctly more. The rate of inflation as measured by the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is likely to rise marginally to 1.8% in the current year, 
and then to remain roughly unchanged in the following years. The fact that energy prices are 
forecast to lose a lot of their momentum and finally even to sink will mask stronger inflation for 
other goods and services. Excluding energy and food, the rate of price increase is likely to pick up 
from 1.4% in the current year to 1.7% in 2019 and to 2.0% in 2020.
Public finances continue to benefit from the economic upturn and from falling interest expend -
iture. The measures taken by Germany’s new government had, for the most part, not been suffi -
ciently well specified when these projections went to press and are therefore taken into account 
only marginally. In the baseline scenario, the general government surplus thus rises to around 
1½% of GDP in 2020.
Compared with the December 2017 projection, distinctly lower economic growth is now expected 
for 2018, whereas slightly higher growth is anticipated for 2019 and 2020. The inflation forecast 
for 2018 was raised slightly, while that for 2020 was lowered a little, mainly because of the 
changed outlook for energy prices. Uncertainties regarding the short and medium- term prospects 
for the German economy have increased considerably. In terms of economic growth, downside 
risks relating to the external environment outweigh the upside risks resulting from the probably 
more expansionary fiscal policy in Germany. As regards the inflation rate, risks are viewed as 
being balanced overall.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
In the final quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 
2018, economic growth in Germany weakened 
distinctly from its previously rapid pace. In this 
period, real GDP rose by a total of 0.9% after 
seasonal and calendar adjustment. It thus fell 
well short of the expectations expressed in the 
December projection.2 That was partly the re -
sult of negative one- off effects in the first quar -
ter of 2018 – such as exceptionally high sick -
ness levels and a marked decline in government 
consumption. Overall, however, the underlying 
cyclical trend probably normalised somewhat 
earlier than had been expected in December 
and has moved to a pace of growth that is only 
slightly above potential growth. The stimulus to 
growth that the manufacturing industry had 
provided in the previous quarters on the back 
of very strong exports came to a fairly abrupt 
halt with the new year. Business investment 
was nonetheless expanded considerably in the 
previous two quarters due to the high capacity 
utilisation, and housing investment also re -
cently picked up again.
The no longer quite so high pace of economic 
growth is likely to continue in the second and 
third quarters. The short- term prospects are 
comparatively uncertain, however. Leading 
economic indicators provide a mixed picture overall, and it is difficult to gauge the influence 
of the dampening one-  off factors in the first 
quarter and the size of potential rebound ef -
fects in the second quarter. In recent months, 
there has been a broad- based deterioration in 
business sentiment, but it still remains well 
above its long- term average. This should be 
seen, in part, as something of a normalisation 
following the previous record highs. The less 
optimistic sentiment, however, probably also 
reflects growing concern about the potential 
negative consequences of increasing protec -
tionism, heightened geopolitical tensions and 
greater political uncertainty in some euro area 
countries. In addition, industrial new orders 
have declined distinctly from the high level they 
reached at the end of 2017. However, the order 
backlog, which continued to rise until March, 
points to ongoing robust demand in manufac -
turing, and short- term export expectations and 
production plans, too, were markedly above 
average as this report went to press. On the 
supply side, there has been a marked increase 
in enterprises’ complaints of labour shortages. 
Overall, manufacturing should resume its cyc -
lical upward movement following the period of 
weakness in the first quarter of 2018, albeit 
with significantly less momentum than a year 
earlier. This, in combination with the high util -
isation of industrial tangible fixed assets, is 
likely to cause enterprises to further increase 
their investment. Buoyed by the good labour 
market developments, strong wage growth 
and unabated good consumer sentiment 
among households, private consumption is 
also likely to improve considerably. The retard -
ing effect of lost purchasing power as a result  
of significantly higher crude oil prices is unlikely 
to have much of an impact.

ther in trend terms, although this will, in 2019, 
probably be temporarily masked by additional 
demand as a result of an expansionary fiscal 
policy. The decisive factor on the supply side is 
the increasing shortage of labour, which is 
making it more and more difficult for industry 
to grow faster than potential output. On the 
demand side, exports are rising distinctly more 
slowly than last year. In the short term, the re -
cent decline in export expectations and in for -
eign industrial orders suggests muted growth. 
In the medium term, relevant factors are that 
growth in German exporters’ sales markets is 
likely to gradually ease off throughout the pro -
jection horizon and that German enterprises 
are, moreover, likely to lose market shares 
abroad. This will mean less lively growth in 
business investment over time. Overall, domes -
tic demand is likely to gradually lose momen -
tum – interrupted by the fiscal stimulus next 
year. Households’ disposable incomes will rise 
more slowly as the considerable slowdown in 
employment growth as a result of labour short -
ages will be only partially offset even by signifi -
cantly higher wage growth. This is likely to curb 
the increase in private consumption. Private 
housing investment is also likely to rise only 
moderately over the next few years, as capaci -
ties can be expanded only gradually in the con -
struction sector, which is operating at full cap -
acity.
Overall, the scenario is thus of an economy in a 
persistent and still strengthening economic 
boom. After an increase of 2.0% this year, 
calendar- adjusted real GDP is likely to rise at an 
only slightly weaker pace of 1.9% in 2019. In 
2020, the pace of growth could moderate fur -
ther to 1.6%.3 Distinctly lower GDP growth is 
thus anticipated for the current year than had 
been projected back in December 2017. This re -
flects the fact that growth in the final quarter 
of 2017 and first quarter of 2018 was much 
lower than had been anticipated. However, In the medium-

slightly higher economic growth is being fore -
cast for 2019, in particular, which can be ex -
plained, not least, by the expansionary fiscal 
measures which have now been factored into 
the projections.
According to this projection, growth of the 
German economy will be consistently higher 
than production potential, whose rate of in -
crease is estimated at 1.5% for both the cur -
rent year and 2019 and forecast to be slightly 
lower, at 1.4%, in 2020, as demographics mean 
that the labour supply will not rise much more. 
Aggregate capacity utilisation, already well 
above normal levels last year, will therefore 
continue to rise distinctly over the horizon of 
the projection. In 2020, the output gap could 
almost reach the level it achieved at the peak 
of the last economic cycle in 2007.
The already sharp upward movement in Ger -
man exports continued at an exceptionally fast 
pace in the final quarter of 2017. However, it 
halted abruptly with the new year, and exports 
even suffered a considerable decline in the first 
quarter of this year. Exports are likely to expand 
markedly again over the projection horizon. 
Growth rates are, however, likely to be more 
muted than last year and fall short of the 
growth rates in German exporters’ sales mar -
kets (see the section on the international envir -
onment on page 17). This is at least suggested 
in the short term by the recently distinctly less 
optimistic export expectations of manufactur -
ing enterprises and the decline in new indus -
trial orders from abroad. It is also implied by 
the potential lagged effects of the earlier ap -
preciation of the euro. Going forward, the cir -
cumstance that German exports are heavily 
concentrated on capital goods and therefore 
likely to suffer from the continued shift in de -
mand from investment to private consumption 
in China is likely to be a factor, amongst other 
things. Exports to the euro area countries could 
be depressed by declining price competitive -
ness. This is mainly because unit labour costs in 
Germany are rising faster than in other euro 
area countries.Aggregate cap -

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. The assump-
tions are based on information available as 
at 22 May 2018. The assumptions regarding 
economic activity in the euro area are de-
rived from projections made by the national 
central banks of the euro area countries.1 
With regard to fi  scal policy, the projection 
incorporates all measures which have been 
adopted or which have already been suffi   -
ciently specifi  ed and are likely to be imple-
mented.
Global economy continues to expand 
at robust pace, world trade buoyant
The global economy grew broadly in line 
with the December projection’s expect-
ations in the fi  nal quarter of 2017 and the 
fi  rst quarter of 2018. Following a slowdown 
in the pace of expansion at the beginning 
of this year, probably in part owing to spe-
cial factors, advanced economies (excluding 
the euro area) are expected to show slightly 
higher growth again in the remainder of 
2018. Over the course of the projection 
horizon, growth is likely to slow somewhat, 
however. Against the backdrop of the tax 
cuts passed by the US Congress at the end 
of 20172 as well as the spending hikes de-
cided upon in February and adopted for the 
current and next fi  scal year, distinctly higher 
GDP growth rates are expected in the 
United States for 2018 and 2019 than had 
been assumed in the December projection.
The emerging market economies will prob-
ably largely maintain the current pace of 
growth over the projection horizon. A grad-
ual deceleration in growth in China is being 
partly offset by developments in other east 
Asian countries and commodity exporters 
profi  ting from higher commodity prices. All in all, the global economy (excluding the 
euro area and weighted by purchasing 
power parities) looks set to grow by 4% this 
year and next. A growth rate of 3¾% is ex-
pected in 2020.
In line with global economic activity, world 
trade is expected to wane slightly over the 
projection horizon. Following a rise of 5% 
this year, international trade (excluding the 
euro area) is expected to increase by 4½% 
next year and 4% in 2020. German export 
markets have a comparable growth profi  le 
with similar rates. Global trade growth is 
now consistently deemed to be somewhat 
stronger than in the December projection, 
not least in light of the higher than ex-
pected pace of growth in the last quarter of 
2017. However, the latest available data 
underlying this projection show that a num-
ber of countries and economic areas were 
still temporarily exempted from the new 
tariffs the US government imposed on steel 
and aluminium imports in March. Taken in 
isolation, the customs obligations which 
have since been extended, amongst others, 
to the EU are hardly likely to impact eco-
nomic activity in Germany. However, along-
side the announcement of further protec-
tionist measures, they have raised the risk 
of additional trade barriers, with negative 
effects on the growth of world trade and 
the global economy.3 As for the United 
Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the 
current status of negotiations implies that 
no trade barriers will be introduced before 
the end of 2020.

Technical assumptions of the projection
With robust demand persisting, supply- side 
factors, in particular, led to a signifi  cant rise 
in crude oil prices compared with last au-
tumn. Against the backdrop of continued 
OPEC production restrictions, key factors in 
this respect were the heightened political 
confl  icts in the Middle East, the uncertain 
political situation and the fall in output in 
Venezuela, and US sanctions against Iran adopted at the beginning of May. By con-
trast, it had been expected in the December 
projection that prices would remain roughly 
unchanged. Given the level now reached, 
the forward quotations from which the as-
sumptions for the projection horizon are 
derived provide an even greater indication 
of a decline in crude oil prices than the pre-
vious projection. In the annual average 
growth rates, this is particularly clear in 
2020. Following their signifi  cant rise at the 
beginning of this year, the prices of other 
commodities on a US dollar basis are set to 
increase moderately in line with global eco-
nomic growth up until 2020.
Given the Eurosystem’s ongoing expansion-
ary monetary policy stance, expectations 
concerning future interest rate movements 
have barely changed since the conclusion 
of the December projection.4 Similar to the 
technical interest rate assumptions for the 
Euribor and the yield on long- term German 
government bonds, which are derived from 
market expectations, the bank lending rates 
are also likely to show only a slight upward 
movement from a very low level. The results 
of the economic survey conducted by the 
German Chamber of Industry and Com-
merce (DIHK) in the early summer of 2018 
show that the percentage of enterprises cit-
ing fi  nancing diffi   culties as a risk to eco-
nomic development remains at a historically 
low level.
The favourable outlook for economic 
growth in the euro area led to a clear ap-
preciation of the euro against the US dollar 
up to mid- February. In the following 
months, the exchange rate only showed 
minor fl  uctuation around this higher level 
before the shift in expectations concerning 
the future interest rate development in the 
United States and the surprisingly weak

economic data for the euro area contrib-
uted to a depreciation of the single cur-
rency in the fi  rst half of May.5 In the period6 
used for deriving the exchange rate as-
sumptions, the euro traded at US$1.18 on 
average, which was more or less the same 
as the level assumed in the December pro-
jection. Compared with the currencies of 
38 major trading partners of the euro area, 
there was a minor appreciation of 1¼% on 
average.
Pace of growth slows down in euro area
Following the rapid expansion last year, 
economic growth in the euro area slowed 
down slightly more signifi  cantly at the be-
ginning of the year than expected. This 
probably owed something to special fac-
tors, although it is assumed that the eco-
nomic expansion will now continue at a 
somewhat slower, but still robust, pace 
above the growth rate of potential output. 
Domestic demand benefi  ts from signifi  cant 
wage growth and further employment 
gains. The labour supply is having an in-
creasingly constraining effect in some coun-
tries. Given rising capacity utilisation, invest-
ment is likely to continue to increase, albeit 
at slightly declining rates. Following the 
slight decline at the start of the year, ex-
ports are expected to show signifi  cant 
growth again over the projection horizon. 
Compared with the December projection, 
the expectations regarding GDP growth in 
the euro area (excluding Germany) were 
lowered slightly by one- tenth in each case 
to rates of 2.1% this year, 1.9% in the com-
ing year and 1.7% for 2020.
New fi  scal plans only taken into 
account  to a minor extent
The fi  scal stance in Germany is moderately 
expansionary in the projection. However, 
only a small part of the extensive plans set 
out in the coalition agreement of the new 
German government are taken into account here, as they have not yet, for the most 
part, been specifi  ed in enough detail (and in 
some cases are not planned until 2021). It is 
primarily agreed changes to social contribu-
tions at the beginning of next year that are 
taken into consideration. For statutory 
health insurance these are the return to 
equal fi  nancing and lower minimum contri-
butions for self- employed persons, and for 
unemployment insurance a reduction of the 
contribution rate from 3.0% to 2.7%. On 
the revenue side, this is accompanied, as 
anticipated in the projection last autumn, 
by smaller cuts to income- related taxes and 
the slight decline in the contribution rate to 
the statutory pension insurance scheme 
from 18.7% to 18.6% at the beginning of 
the current year. According to this projec-
tion, the contribution rate to the statutory 
pension insurance scheme will be reduced 
by an additional 0.1  percentage point in 
2019, so as to prevent the upper limit for 
the reserves from once again being ex-
ceeded signifi  cantly at the end of 2019.7 
Furthermore, the health insurance institu-
tions are expected to lower their (respect-
ive) supplementary contribution rates on 
average. By contrast, the fi  nancial burdens 
of the last reform of long- term care neces-
sitate, according to the reserves rule, raising 
the contribution rate for public long- term 
care by 0.1 percentage point in 2020. On 
the expenditure side, it is assumed, as last 
autumn, that central, state and local gov-
ernments are taking a moderately expan-
sionary stance.

Given increasing aggregate capacity utilisation, 
enterprises continued to up investment in the 
final quarter of 2017 and first three months of 
2018. The upswing in business investment 
should continue over the projection horizon. 
This is suggested by the increasing capacity 
overutilisation in the economy as a whole and 
the fact that financing terms remain favourable 
despite a slight uptick in interest rates. None -
theless, the increase in business investment is 
likely to gradually slow, as foreign demand for 
German export goods will tend to grow at a 
slightly slower pace. As compared to earlier 
boom periods, enterprises’ propensity to invest 
is likely to remain comparatively muted.4
Housing investment rose moderately in the last 
three months of 2017 and first three months of 
2018. Although the weather conditions were 
fairly favourable overall in a long- term compari -
son, growth was only marginally higher than 
anticipated in the December projection. This, in 
association with the concomitant sharp accel -eration in construction prices, suggests that 
capacity in the construction industry, where 
utilisation levels are already high, cannot be ex -
panded quite as rapidly as previously expected. 
The fact that the number of new dwellings 
completed in 2017 was only slightly higher 
than in 2016 although the number of building 
permits issued had previously risen sharply fits 
into this picture. Activity in new housing con -
struction is likely largely to remain at existing 
levels over the projection horizon. Although 
the favourable outlook for the labour market 
and household incomes suggests that demand 
for housing will continue to rise, the unfavour -
able demographic trends within Germany and 
the assumption that labour market- oriented 
immigration is likely to be less dynamic are 
acting to dampen the formation of new house -
holds. Mortgage lending rates remain very low. 
However, they have trended upwards since the 
beginning of 2017, and this development will 
continue in the years to come, according to the 
projection assumptions. The headwinds from 
rising interest rates should remain manageable, 
however. Unlike new housing, investment in 
existing buildings is likely to continue to rise 
considerably, not least as a result of the re -
quirements in the context of energy- saving 
measures and to render properties more suit -
able for elderly residents. In terms of real hous -
ing investment overall, moderate growth rates 
are therefore likely, while prices for construc -
tion work should continue to rise very sharply.
Government investment is set to continue ex -
panding significantly over the projection hori -
zon. It is plausible that additional funds will be 
earmarked, in particular, for transport infra -
structure, child day- care and schools, and suffi -Upswing in busi -

4 This is because there are still production reserves abroad, 
which are likely to tend to brake investment in capacity

also have a role to play. For further information, see also

cient budget funds are available. From this per -
spective, it is also conceivable that investment 
could pick up to an even greater extent. With 
respect to limited administrative and construc -
tion capacities, however, the real expansion as -
sumed here already appears fairly high.
All in all, real gross fixed capital formation will 
experience strong but – given the slowdown in 
business investment growth over time – declin -
ing growth stimulus in the current and coming 
year. As things currently stand, this will also 
hold in 2020.
Following a lull in the second half of 2017, 
there was a renewed surge in private consump -
tion in early 2018. As the year goes on, it is 
likely that private consumption, bolstered by 
the continued excellent conditions on the la -
bour market and the strong wage increases 
stemming from the latest wage agreements, 
will maintain its role as a major growth driver. 
That said, the annual average growth rate will 
still be curbed by the stagnation felt in the 
second half of 2017. At the start of next year, 
the assumed changes in social contributions 
will give an additional boost to households’ 
disposable income, and thus to consumer 
spending, despite the likelihood that some of 
the gains in purchasing power will initially be 
saved. A return to full joint financing of the 
statutory health insurance scheme will take 
pressure off employees. Furthermore, it is as -
sumed here that the contribution rates to the 
unemployment and statutory pension insur -
ance schemes will be cut at the same time.5 
However, the underlying growth in real dispos -
able income is likely to tail off markedly over 
the course of the projection horizon, as the 
supply- driven slowdown in the pace of employ -
ment growth will be only partly offset by higher 
real wage increases. Seen from the present per -
spective, growth in private consumption could 
therefore be considerably weaker in 2020.Gross fixed

Significant increases in government consump -
tion are expected over the projection horizon, 
with all key sub- segments – tangible good pur -
chases, personnel expenditure, and healthcare 
and long- term care benefits – playing a role.
Import growth is, on average for 2018, likely to 
come under significant strain owing to a large 
drop in the first quarter. The stronger growth 
anticipated in 2019 reflects the projected 
changes in the main components of demand. 
Of particular importance in this regard are not 
only exports but also investment in machinery 
and equipment, as they each include an above- 
average level of imports. Private consumption, 
too, plays an important role on account of its 
high weight. All in all, imports will be bolstered 
by the fact that the German economy will, in 
the years to come, too, assume a growing role 
in the international division of labour, meaning 
that the import shares of all demand compon -
ents will probably increase. The high demand 
for imports should, above all, stand exporters 
from other euro area countries in good stead, 
as they will become more price competitive 
than their competitors in non- euro area coun -
tries.
The high current account surplus in Germany is 
expected to further contract over the projec -
tion horizon. The key factor here is the trade 
balance, as it is assumed that the balance of 
primary and secondary income will not change 
appreciably. This year, the decline will be driven 
by once again considerably less favourable 
terms of trade in the wake of the oil price hike. 
By contrast, real foreign trade will initially exert 
a certain level of upward pressure despite 
markedly dampened export growth. It is only 
from next year on that real imports will increase 
at a distinctly faster pace than real exports, 
which will play a part in reducing the balance 
to a certain extent. The current account bal -
ance could therefore fall from 8.1% of GDP in 
2017 to 7.6% of GDP in 2019.Labour market
Labour market conditions continued to im -
prove significantly over the course of the final 
quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. 
Employment rose very sharply over the past six 
months (factoring out seasonal effects), with 
just under 330,000 additional workforce mem -
bers. Growth was therefore slightly higher than 
anticipated in the December projection, and 
registered unemployment fell to a greater ex -
tent than expected.
Labour market developments look set to re -
main highly favourable as the year progresses. 
Leading indicators suggest that employment 
will rise considerably in the months to come, 
although the pace of growth is likely to dip. 
Even so, the increase in the number of persons 
in employment on an annual average in 2018 is 
expected to be only slightly down on the year. 
Registered unemployment is likely to continue 
falling in line with the positive underlying cyc -
lical trend.
In view of the excellent state of the economy, 
labour demand will continue to rise consider -
ably over the projection horizon. The limiting 
factor for the labour market is, to an increasing 
extent, the supply of persons wishing to en -
gage in gainful employment. There have been 
growing signs of skilled labour shortages in re -
cent years. According to Federal Employment 
Agency figures, the time it takes for enterprises 
to fill a vacancy has risen by more than 30 days 
since early 2014 to an average of around three- 
and- a- half months. In shortage occupations 
such as care of the elderly, it can take as long 
as around six months. As underemployment fell 
and the number of unfilled vacancies increased, 
2.1 unemployed persons in arithmetical terms 
applied for each vacancy in the first quarter of 
2018. Four years ago, this figure stood at 3.6 Government

unemployed persons.6 The number of persons 
who stated that they were working part- time 
involuntarily owing to a lack of full- time pos -
itions has also fallen sharply in recent years.
It is assumed that this trend will intensify over 
the next few years. Offsetting the impact of the 
decreasing size of the working- age population 
due to demographic change by bringing add -
itional domestic workers into the labour force 
or by means of immigration will become in -
creasingly ineffective.7 The labour force partici -
pation rate has risen considerably since 2004 
and is now already one of the highest in the 
EU. It will therefore probably be all but impos -
sible to achieve similarly high growth over the 
next few years. This is further underscored by 
the fact that the age structure of the working- 
age population is shifting towards age groups 
with low participation rates. The greatest po -
tential still lies with the oldest age groups. As a 
result, and buoyed by the rising statutory retire -
ment age, the sharpest assumed rise in the pro -
jection will be among over-60-year- olds. Added 
to this is the ongoing integration into the la -
bour market of those persons who have immi -
grated to Germany in recent years. Female par -
ticipation in the labour force is already above 
the EU average. That said, it is still set to edge 
slightly further upwards. However, the hours 
worked by women in Germany are rather low 
compared with the hours worked by women in 
other EU countries. As part of the projection, it 
is therefore assumed that, as skilled labour 
shortages grow, working time autonomy in -
creases and the childcare infrastructure is ex -
panded further, the average working hours per 
employee will rise slightly.
Net immigration is likely to play a dwindling 
role in the years to come. Contrary to the ex -
pectations outlined in the December projec -
tion, the data available so far show that, in net 
terms, the number of immigrants in 2017 was 
barely short of the 2016 figure. While refugee 
movements diminished even further in import -
ance, the number of migrants from other EU 
countries, particularly from central and eastern Europe, rose temporarily. Factors such as the 
United Kingdom’s decision to withdraw from 
the EU, amongst other things, could have 
played a role here. However, underlying trends 
such as rising labour income in eastern Europe 
and greater employment opportunities in 
southern Europe will further reduce the migra -
tion flows expected over the next few years. It 
is thus assumed in the projection that the net 
immigration balance of 500,000 persons in 
2017 will gradually shrink to 350,000 persons 
by 2020. Net immigration of 1.2 million per -
sons in cumulative terms is assumed for the 
period from 2018 to 2020, which is markedly 
up on the figure in the December 2017 projec -
tion.
All in all, as the time horizon increases in length, 
the expansion of the labour force lessens. An -
nual growth compared with 2017 will have 
halved by 2019, and it will have plummeted 
even further by 2020. The persistently high de -

ment. With phases of unemployment that are 
shorter on average, human capital losses will 
tend to be avoided, which will increase em -
ployment opportunities and reduce structural 
unemployment. The unemployment rate could 
also therefore fall markedly below 5% on an 
annual average in 2019. All the same, owing to 
supply reasons, fewer new positions will be 
filled from one year to the next. The scarcer la -
bour supply is likely to significantly inhibit em -
ployment growth in 2019, and even more so in 
2020.
Labour costs and prices
Negotiated pay rates will probably increase far 
more this year than in previous years.8 In view 
of the considerable increase in domestic labour 
market tightness, favourable economic activity 
and higher short-  run inflation expectations 
than in previous years, the wage agreements 
that have been concluded by management and labour thus far in 2018 for major sectors such 
as the metal- working and electrical engineer -
ing industries, the central and local govern -
ment public sector and construction contain 
markedly higher wage rises than the previous 
pay round.9 Staff shortages will continue to 
grow in 2019 and 2020, with the result that 
future wage agreements are likely to be even 
higher. However, the wage agreements that 
were recently concluded contained high wage 
increases at the start of the agreements’ fairly 
long terms, with increases at later points in 
time that are often significantly lower. As a re -
sult, negotiated pay rates in 2019 as a whole 
and probably in 2020 as well are not – given 
their rise by an average of just under 3% in 
each year – likely to increase more sharply than 
in the current year.10
Actual earnings are likely to increase even more 
sharply than negotiated rates of pay over the 
projection horizon. The anticipated rise in 
working hours, compensation components 
that increasingly exceed collectively agreed 
rates and performance- based bonuses will all 
contribute to a positive wage drift. However, 
this is likely to be smaller this year than in 2017 
as tight labour market conditions were latterly 
reflected more strongly in the recently agreed 
higher negotiated pay rate increases. In the 
years to come, however, the wage drift could 
rise again if the negotiated pay rate increase 
remains the same on an annual average and 
skilled labour shortages increase. Furthermore,

8 Factors that contributed – some with a lagged effect – to 
the subdued rise in previous years are lower rates of in -
crease in productivity and consumer price growth and the 
increase in the labour supply as a result of high net immi -
gration from other EU countries. For more information, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank, Wage growth in Germany: assess -
ment and determinants of recent developments, Monthly

10 All past pay agreements included in the Bundesbank’s 
negotiated pay rate statistics (around 500 collective wage 
agreements and regulations on civil servant pay) are fac -
tored into the projections of negotiated wage increases 
and extrapolated beyond their contractual term, taking 
into account the overall economic situation and industry-  
specific features.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2018  
24

the expected increase in the statutory general 
minimum wage in 201911 is expected to exert 
upward pressure on wages in pay grades that 
are not captured in the negotiated pay rate 
statistics and thus increase wage drift.12
With respect to employee compensation 
which, in addition to gross wages and salaries, 
also covers employers’ social contributions, the 
slight cut in the contribution rate to the statu -
tory pension insurance scheme will bring with 
it relief in the current year. Next year, however, 
the return to full joint financing of the statutory 
health insurance scheme will push labour costs 
markedly upwards, though it may be assumed 
that this will be mitigated slightly by lower con -
tribution rates to the unemployment and statu -
tory pension insurance schemes. In combin -
ation with labour productivity, which, following 
the slow start to the year, will probably grow to 
a lesser extent this year than last year before 
picking up the pace again next year in line with 
favourable economic conditions, this means 
that the rise in unit labour costs will be sub -
stantial across the entire projection horizon and 
is likely to be higher than, say, the average of 
the past five years.
The rise in unit labour costs and the changes in 
aggregate profit margins together determine 
domestic price pressures as measured by the 
GDP deflator. The margins will initially narrow, 
as enterprises – apart from the booming con -
struction sector – will unlikely be able to fully 
pass on their more sharply rising labour costs 
to their sales prices in a timely manner, espe -
cially while import prices are increasing consid -
erably at the same time. In light of the good 
economic activity, however, it can be assumed 
that the higher costs will be passed on with a 
certain time lag, so that profit margins will have 
a chance to recover by the end of the projec -
tion horizon. Growth in the GDP deflator, 
which stood at 1.5% in the previous year, is 
likely to increase fairly evenly to 2.1% next year 
and experience further marked growth at the 
end of the projection horizon. In this context, 
the substantial domestic inflation was reflected particularly in the construction sector, which is 
distinctly ahead of the overall economy in its 
cyclical position.
At the consumer level, prices recently rose 
more sharply than expected in the December 
projection. Overall, annual inflation in the HICP 
stood at 2.2% in May, which was considerably 
higher than had been estimated in December. 
Contrary to assumptions, energy prices did not 
fall, but increased markedly in line with the 
higher prices of crude oil. A role was also 
played by the fact that food prices rose some -
what more sharply than expected. The rate ex -
cluding energy and food (core rate), by con -
trast, was lower than projected, as the prices 
for a large proportion of goods and services 
only saw moderate growth. Lagged effects of 
the earlier appreciation of the euro are likely to 
have contributed to this. Furthermore, this 
could indicate that the pressures on the labour 
market and in the economy as a whole may be 
reflected in consumer prices to a slightly lesser 
extent and/ or later than was projected in De -
cember.Stronger wage

11 Pursuant to statutory provisions, the independent Min -

will not be raised, a certain countermovement is expected.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

In 2018, the core rate is likely to be only mar -
ginally higher than in the previous year due to 
the subdued increase in the prices of services 
and industrial goods (excluding energy) of late. 
As of next year, the rising wages and higher 
import costs should be reflected in the core 
rate to a greater degree, especially as the price- 
dampening impact of the euro appreciation 
will no longer be felt. However, it must be as -
sumed that there will be a time lag in enter -
prises passing on the surge in wage costs, 
which are due to higher employers’ social con -
tributions, to consumers in the coming year. 
For this reason, it is likely that the resulting 
price pressures will develop more strongly only 
later in the projection horizon. Overall, the rate 
excluding energy and food could climb from 
1.3% in the previous year to 1.4% in the cur -
rent year, and to 1.7% in 2019. In 2020, the 
core rate could reach 2% if the cyclical situ -
ation remains exceptionally good.13The quite substantial rise in food prices of late 
is likely to experience a distinct slowdown by 
next year. Lower price dynamics amongst agri -
cultural products in the euro area will initially 
continue to counteract the higher wage 
growth. As soon as this peters out during the 
course of the projection horizon, food prices 
could rise more sharply again. Energy prices 
will probably increase again markedly this year 
due to the steep rise in crude oil prices, and the 
appreciation of the euro compared with the 
previous year will only provide a limited coun -
terbalance. Based on assumptions, crude oil 
prices will indeed fall in the following two 
years, though it is likely that consumer prices 
for energy will continue to rise initially despite 
this. Alongside lagged effects of the earlier in -
crease in the price of crude oil, distinctly higher 
electricity prices will also be a contributing fac -
tor. Consumer prices for energy could poten -
tially experience a slight drop by 2020 at the 
earliest.
Overall, the HICP rate could be slightly higher 
than in the previous year at 1.8% due to the 
continuing steep increases in energy prices in 
2018. Over the course of the projection hori -
zon, two opposing trends are apparent. While 
the contribution of energy decreases, the core 
rate rises significantly. In this context, the ef -
fects of the falling contribution of energy will 
be predominant in 2019, resulting in the head -
line rate experiencing a slight, temporary drop 
to 1.7%. However, the impact of the increasing 
core rate will then be felt in 2020, and the 
headline rate will rise.

finances are benefitting from favourable eco -
nomic activity, falling interest expenditure, and 
the end of temporary expenses.14 These posi -
tive effects stand in contrast to a moderately 
expansionary fiscal stance, which is reflected by 
a deterioration of the structural primary bal -
ance15 in the current year and a somewhat 
greater deterioration in the coming year. Over -
all, the general government surplus will there -
fore grow slightly in the current year (2017: 
+1.2% of GDP). Next year, the surplus will re -
main more or less unchanged and, in 2020, will 
again see a slight rise to 1½% of GDP . In this 
context, however, the new Federal Govern -
ment’s fiscal policy proposals have only been 
taken into account to a limited extent (see 
page 19), as many measures had not yet been 
specified in sufficient detail at the time the pro -
jections were finalised. Moreover, given the fa -
vourable financial positions at all levels of gov -
ernment, it can be expected that the financial 
easing will go beyond the measures that have 
now been covered by the decisions on the fed -
eral budget. Not least, the Federal Government 
has announced its intention to make use of any 
other financial leeway as long as a balanced 
budget is achieved. Overall, it is likely that the 
fiscal policy stance will therefore be consider -
ably more expansionary and the surpluses will 
be lower. If an additional fiscal easing com -
pared with the baseline of this projection were 
to reach around 1% of GDP in 2020, the gen -
eral government surpluses would sink below 
1% of GDP and no major surpluses would re -
main in structural terms.
In the baseline, revenues are developing largely 
in parallel to nominal GDP , and therefore dy -
namically, in the current year. In the coming 
year, they will be dampened slightly by a reduc -
tion in the contribution rate to unemployment 
insurance in particular. In this period, expend -
iture will be curbed by the continuing fall in 
interest expenditure, and the temporary ex -
penses will come to an end. These factors ob -
scure the fairly considerable increase in struc -
tural primary expenditure.16 Even without the 
additional burdens in social expenditure that have been proposed but not yet taken into ac -
count, significant rises in pensions and health -
care expenditure in particular can thus be ex -
pected. In addition, in light of the large sur -
pluses, stronger growth in expenditure in areas 
such as childcare, education, transport infra -
structure, domestic security, and defence at the 
central, state and local government levels has 
already been factored into the baseline. The 
slight improvement in the fiscal balance in 
2020 reflects, above all, the continuing positive 
cyclical effects on revenues combined with a 
renewed, marginal fall in interest burdens.Government

The debt ratio is likely to continue at a brisk 
pace on its downward path (end-2017: 64.1%) 
and should fall below the 60% threshold in 
2019 at the latest, even in the event of signifi -
cant fiscal easing. The considerable nominal 
GDP growth in the ratio’s denominator is a key 
contributor to this. Furthermore, it is likely that 
the portfolios of government-  owned “bad 
banks” will continue to be dismantled, though 
this may be eclipsed by one- off effects at times.
Risk assessment
The projection presented here describes the 
most probable scenario for economic growth 
and the inflation rate as seen from the present 
perspective under the assumptions given. How -
ever, a multitude of factors may cause actual 
economic developments to turn out differently 
than described here. Since December 2017, the 
uncertainties regarding the outlook for the 
German economy have grown substantially. 
With regard to economic growth, the short-  
term prospects are already relatively difficult to 
estimate at the current juncture due to incon -
sistent signals from various economic indica -
tors. In particular, GDP could also see weaker 
growth than anticipated in the second and 
third quarters. On the whole, external down -
ward risks to economic activity are now pre -
dominant over the medium term, too. In this 
vein, the most recent discussion on trade 
started by the United States has again led to an 
increased risk of growing protectionism world -
wide. An escalating global trade dispute or 
widespread rises in import tariffs would have a 
marked negative impact on Germany’s export- 
oriented economy. This would also be the case, 
albeit to a lesser extent, if the United Kingdom 
were to withdraw from the European Union 
without a transitional phase or a free trade 
agreement, as this would indeed be accom -
panied by the direct introduction of customs 
barriers and non- tariff trade restrictions. Other 
downward risks to the world economy are a 
sudden tightening of global financing terms,

economies particularly hard, as well as height -
ening geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. 
Furthermore, political factors could rekindle the 
sovereign debt crisis in some euro area coun -
tries, leading to turbulence on the financial 
markets and negative, real economic conse -
quences also in Germany.
With regard to the domestic economy, by con -
trast, opportunities for greater economic 
growth prevail at this point. In this context, the 
labour supply in the projection horizon could 
react more elastically than expected to the per -
sistently high demand for labour, for example if 
an even greater number of specialised workers 
than assumed migrate to Germany from abroad 
as a result of the tight labour market. It is highly 
likely that fiscal policy will act as an additional 
stimulus to demand. The intentions of the new 
Federal Government had mostly not been spe -
cified in sufficient detail when the projections 
were finalised to be able to factor them into 
the baseline. Moreover, in light of the highly 
favourable position of German government 
budgets at present, further expansionary meas -
ures would be plausible. The scope, timeframe 
and characteristics of these, however, are diffi -
cult to estimate. If the additional fiscal stimulus 
were to reach a funding volume of around 1% 
of GDP in 2020, the expected level of real GDP 
in Germany – based on standardised calcula -
tions with the Bundesbank’s macroeconomet -
ric model  – could stand approximately ¾% 
higher in comparison to the baseline at the end 
of the projection horizon. In the projected scenario with a high utilisation rate and supply- 
side shortages, however, the real economic im -
pact could be less severe and the otherwise 
– at least at first – more limited price impact 
could be greater.
As regards future crude oil prices, which have a 
major impact on the consumer price projection 
in particular, neither the existing upside nor 
downside risks seem to have gained the upper 
hand at present. A prolonged rise in oil prices 
– due to political tensions in major oil- producing 
countries, for example – is likely to be opposed 
to a possible increase in the production of shale 
oil in the United States.
In the overall picture, too, risks for the price 
projection seem to be in balance. Admittedly, 
consumer prices could rise more sluggishly 
than described here if global demand for goods 
drops or if a more elastic labour supply in Ger -
many stifles wage growth. However, new trade 
barriers could, at least temporarily, raise the 
rate of inflation. A more expansionary fiscal 
policy would also exert a certain amount of 
additional upward pressure on prices. One un -
certainty for measured inflation that cannot be 
dismissed is the transition to a new underlying 
weighting scheme for the HICP in 2019. This is 
all the more important, as it is accompanied by 
methodological changes in the measurement 
of prices for major components of the con -
sumer price index, such as rents and package 
holidays.… over

Lower bound, inflation target and the 
anchoring of inflation expectations
One of the outcomes of the financial crisis has been an in- depth debate on possible lessons for 
monetary policy, including the question of whether central banks should raise the inflation target 
in order to widen the safety margin to the lower bound, thus broadening monetary policymakers’ 
scope for action.
From the perspective of a central bank, choosing the targeted inflation rate is a decision involving 
a trade- off between the costs of a higher general rate of price increase and the benefits of a 
greater distance to the effective lower bound on the nominal interest rate. Such an assessment is 
complex and has numerous facets. The present article addresses this issue in the currently prevail -
ing paradigm of monetary analysis, the New Keynesian model. This means that two aspects are 
placed at the centre of the analysis: first, the costs of inflation due to a distortion of relative prices 
in an economy, and, second, the benefit of greater room for manoeuvre for monetary policy in 
the light of a binding effective lower bound.
Those who favour raising the inflation target emphasise the latter. However, what is often neg -
lected is the fact that, in this model framework, a higher inflation target has wider implications, 
since it changes the price- setting behaviour of firms. As a result, the central bank has to adopt 
a more aggressive interest rate policy response to economic developments, which means losing 
part of the room for manoeuvre that has just been gained, while the costs of inflation caused by 
distortions in relative prices continue to exist.
What is likewise largely ignored in the current debate about a higher inflation target is the asso -
ciated risk that inflation expectations become unanchored. However, a firm anchoring of inflation 
expectations is of crucial importance for monetary policymakers being able to steer aggregate 
demand effectively. The present article therefore also discusses this aspect explicitly in the frame -
work of a New Keynesian model.
Overall, it becomes clear that – even within a homogeneous model framework – the underlying 
implications of raising the inflation target are more complex than they appear at first sight. Even 
though monetary policy research on this issue is still in its infancy, a strong case can be made at 
present for not abandoning the monetary policy consensus within the developed economies that 
aims to keep the inflation rate at about 2% per year over the medium term in favour of a higher 
target rate of inflation.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The financial and economic crisis led to a con -
traction of economic output worldwide that 
was unprecedented in the post- war era and 
prompted governments and central banks to 
take exceptional countermeasures, some of 
which came in for heated discussion. Soon 
after the outbreak of the crisis, far- reaching 
questions were raised about the long- term les -
sons to be drawn from it. In the meantime, 
many decisions have been taken on strength -
ening the long- term resilience of the financial 
and banking system.1 Monetary policymakers 
have also found themselves faced with new 
challenges.2 In view of the severe economic 
downturn and the sharp declines in inflation 
rates, their monetary policy mandate has also 
been subjected to critical examination.3
After reaching the effective lower bound (see 
the chart on page 33), not only did a number 
of central banks take a series of accommoda -
tive non- standard (“unconventional”) monetary 
policy measures such as the asset purchase 
programmes;4 a matter also raised for discus -
sion –  looking ahead to the time after the 
period of low inflation – was a revision of their 
mandate in terms of raising the target inflation 
rate. As a result, monetary policymakers should 
have more room for manoeuvre in terms of 
interest rate policy in the future.5 At first sight, 
a raising of the inflation target6 per se  reduces 
the probability of the lower bound being bind -
ing, as the average level of nominal interest 
rates – the sum of the real interest rate level 
and the (expected) inflation rate – increases, re -
sulting in a greater scope for any (nominal) 
interest rate cuts.7 In the event of a further es -
calation of the crisis, with the risk of very low 
or even negative inflation rates, monetary pol -
icymakers could then intervene in economic ac -
tivity in future for longer and with a stronger 
stabilising impact by making cuts in interest 
rates.8
Basically, there are various reasons that – each 
on its own terms – might argue in favour of choosing a positive target inflation rate (see the 
box on rigid nominal wages, measurement 
errors etc on pages 34 to 36). The present art -
icle, however, focuses below chiefly on two key 
aspects, comparing the respective costs and Financial crisis

also wrote an open letter calling for a rethink of the Fed’s 
2% inflation target, see “Rethink 2%” of 9 June 2017 at 
https://  equitablegrowth.org/ rethink-2/
6 The terms “inflation target” and later also “target infla -
tion rate” are used below purely for the sake of linguistic 
simplicity. As is well known, the Eurosystem aims for an 
inflation rate in the euro area that is below, but close to, 
2% over the medium term. The Governing Council of the 
ECB therefore does not pursue an inflation target in the 
strict sense. As a synonym for “inflation target” and “target 
inflation rate”, “targeted inflation rate” is also used below.
7 These considerations are based on the Fisher equation 
(named after Irving Fisher (1930), The theory of interest, 
Macmillan, New York), according to which the sum of the 
real interest rate and the expected inflation rate roughly 
corresponds to the nominal interest rate. As the real inter -
est rate is independent of the inflation rate over the long 
term (as is typically assumed in the literature), the nominal 
interest rate, taken in isolation, rises (1:1) with the rate of 
inflation in the long term.
8 This is based on two considerations: First, the greater 
scope for interest rate cuts reduces the likelihood of reach -
ing the effective lower bound. Second, the lower bound 
tends to become less restrictive if inflation expectations 
have adjusted to the higher level. This means that the real 
interest rate at the effective lower bound, taken in isol -
ation, can fall more sharply than with lower inflation ex -
pectations (owing to a lower inflation target).Deutsche Bundesbank

benefits of a higher target inflation rate. The 
costs and benefits are weighed against each 
other in the context of the currently prevailing 
model of monetary policy analysis, the proto -
typical New Keynesian model. Confining the 
analysis to this model framework means forgo -
ing individual aspects of the cost- benefit analy -
sis which it has so far not been possible to inte-
grate comprehensively into this type of model. 
It does, however, allow a consistent discussion 
of arguments within the theoretical framework 
that plays a prominent role in the international 
debate.
The main macroeconomic costs of inflation 
arise from nominal rigidities, leading to price 
stickiness. These, in turn, imply a distortion of 
relative prices, which ultimately brings an inef -
ficient allocation of resources in a given econ -
omy in its wake. The main advantage that rais -
ing the inflation target is thought to offer, after 
the experience of the financial crisis, consists in 
the enlarged scope for monetary policy action 
in light of a binding effective lower bound. 
Both aspects can be weighed against each 
other in order to derive from them the quanti -
tative implications for the “optimal” target level 
of inflation. Such a trade- off is inherently com -
plex because higher inflation rates not only re -
sult in greater room for manoeuvre for monet -
ary policy; they simultaneously reduce that scope by affecting how firms set their prices. 
Yet, to the degree that the hoped- for add -
itional room for manoeuvre is lost as quickly as 
it is gained, while the allocative distortions of a 
higher inflation target continue to exist in the 
form of costs, the balance of the pros and cons 
of raising the inflation target will be skewed 
more to the downside as the target inflation 
rate increases. The key mechanisms of this are 
to be presented in this article.
In the debate about a higher inflation target, 
what is also mostly ignored is the associated 
risk of inflation expectations becoming unan -
chored from the inflation target. However, 
from a monetary policy perspective, the firm 
anchoring of inflation expectations is of crucial 
importance. The expected rate of inflation is a 
major determinant of the actual path of infla -
tion. Thus, anchored inflation expectations are 
a major prerequisite for being able to steer ag -
gregate demand effectively. If economic agents 
expect, say, a longer- term rise in inflation on 
account of a protracted increase in commodity 
prices, they will demand higher wages “today” 
in order to compensate for the expected threat 
of a loss of purchasing power. As a conse -
quence, firms will attempt to pass on the 
higher wage costs in their prices. In a worst-  
case scenario, a price- wage spiral could 
emerge, ultimately jeopardising the objective … and also

Further reasons to select a positive target rate of infl  ation
This box highlights a number of further rea-
sons to select a positive target rate of infl  a-
tion other than to secure suffi   cient room for 
manoeuvre when there is a binding zero 
lower bound on interest rates.1 Further-
more, the literature shows that a positive 
rate of infl  ation can reduce existing ineffi   -
ciencies in the economy.2, 3 In this context, 
selecting an optimal infl  ation target can be 
understood as a trade- off between various 
ineffi   ciencies.
While the main article focuses on ineffi   cien-
cies as a result of the effective lower bound 
and distortions in relative prices, the litera-
ture also discusses additional ineffi   ciencies 
such as nominal wage rigidities, differences 
in productivity between fi  rms and heteroge-
neities in the monetary union.4 In addition, 
distortions in the measurement of infl  ation 
are commonly cited.
– Measurement errors arise, for instance, 
from diffi   culties in correctly recording the 
price equivalent of changes in quality or 
to the basket of goods underlying the 
measurement. Experience has shown 
that measurement errors make it diffi   cult 
to adequately assess changes in prices. 
For this reason, in the past, positive infl  a-
tion targets have traditionally been at-
tributed to measurement errors when 
recording statistics for the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices.5 This is based 
on the idea that, in principle, the target 
rate of infl  ation should be around 0%. 
However, as the statistics cannot fully 
refl  ect  improvements in the quality of 
goods or changes in consumer demand, 
in particular, promptly and accurately 
enough, the offi   cially reported infl  ation 
rate is considered to be somewhat over-
stated, meaning that “zero infl  ation” measured according to the price index 
would mean a de facto fall in the aggre-
gate price level. The monetary policy in-
fl  ation target should thus be adjusted 
upwards in order to allow for these 
1 Due to the abundance of different reasons in favour 
of a positive rate of infl  ation, this box can discuss only 
a few selected arguments. For a more comprehensive 
overview, see S  Schmitt- Grohé and M  Uribe (2011),

Economics, Vol 3, pp 653-722.

tion in the theory of public fi  nance, The Swedish Jour-
nal of Economics 75, pp 67-82, which discuss the ef-
fects of taxation on the optimal rate of infl  ation. Ac-
cording to the Friedman rule, under fl  exible prices, the 
opportunity cost of holding money should equal the 
marginal cost of creating money. The long- run optimal 
rate of infl  ation is therefore defl  ation equal to the real 
interest rate. This assumes lump- sum taxation. How-
ever, an “upward” deviation from the Friedman rule 
may actually be optimal if only distortionary taxation is 
available to fi  nance public spending. For a list of fur-
ther considerations, see A Diercks (2017), The reader’s

ation framework, it is not possible to simply cumulate 
the optimal rates resulting from the respective argu-
ments in order to arrive at the optimal rate of infl  ation.

measurement errors.6 However, in mon-
etary policy practice, the quantitative sig-
nifi  cance of measurement errors is now 
of minor importance only due to an im-
provement in statistical methods.7
– A positive average rate of infl  ation (ad-
justed for measurement errors) is also 
recommended to ensure more fl  exible 
labour  market adjustments in the case of 
constraints stemming from “downward” 
rigidity in nominal wages. Empirical stud-
ies suggest that it is much more diffi   cult 
to cut nominal wages than it is to raise 
wages.8 If, for instance, an adverse shock 
(for example, triggered by negative prod-
uctivity growth), taken in isolation, advo-
cates a reduction in real wages but nom-
inal wages cannot be cut, the necessary 
wage adjustments in the labour market 
will be delayed, leading to an increase in 
unemployment and a loss of economic 
activity. By contrast, a positive average 
rate of infl  ation can make it easier to re-
duce real wages even in the absence of a 
decrease in nominal wages.
– Differing levels of productivity across 
fi  rms can also justify positive target infl  a-
tion rates. If there are sector- specifi  c 
productivity growth rates (which is con-
fi  rmed empirically on a regular basis), 
these generally also imply different 
sector- specifi  c price trends.9 Such differ-
ences in productivity can also occur for 
the manufacture of new goods com-
pared to those already existing on the 
market (“old” goods). New products (or 
products with substantial quality im-
provements) are often manufactured 
using state- of- the- art technology and 
this technology requires extended learn-
ing phases before effi   ciency gains can 
unfold over time. Once production has 
been switched over to the new technol-
ogy, fi  rms’ production costs initially rise and these costs –  as described in the 
main article  – are passed on to con-
sumers in the form of higher prices. This 
ultimately drives up the optimal rate of 
infl  ation.10 Therefore, when selecting its 
infl  ation target, the central bank should 
take account of the fact that, when 
taken in isolation, positive infl  ation in-
duced by differences in productivity does 
6 However, the mere fact that measurement errors 
exist is not necessarily signifi  cant when selecting the 
infl  ation target. From the point of view of optimal 
monetary policy, greater attention should be paid to 
whether prices subject to measurement errors are able 
to react relatively fl  exibly or not. If, for example, these 
prices react very fl  exibly, having a positive infl  ation tar-
get would mean adjusting those prices that are not 
subject to measurement errors, but associated with 
production ineffi   ciencies, to the general price level. See

10 Over the production lifecycle, the marginal costs of 
older goods decline on the scale by which production 
becomes more effi   cient due to the new technology. 
Firms take this into account in their pricing and thus 
set a lower price over the production cycle, which 
gives rise to adjustment costs, however. Yet as fi  rms 
have to set prices in any case as part of the product 
substitution process, these costs (which are otherwise 
to be expected) do not need to be factored into the 
pricing of new goods. Therefore, a positive rate of in-
fl  ation helps keep the relative prices of new vis- à- vis 
old goods in line with the production lifecycle and thus 
the respective cost development of the fi  rms. Quanti-
tative studies suggest that product substitution pro-
vides notable explanatory power for positive target 
rates of infl  ation. For more information, see K Adam

of price stability. Monetary policymakers there -
fore have to create confidence through cred -
ible policymaking in order to keep inflation ex -
pectations in line with their target. Therefore, 
the potential implications of a higher inflation 
target for the anchoring of inflation expect -
ations are discussed.
In light of the low inflation rates at present and 
the at times hotly debated unconventional 
measures, the proposal to raise the monetary 
policy inflation target, which is shaping the 
international debate, may come as something 
of a surprise. Given the persistently low rate of 
price increase at present, it might – on the sur -
face – seem the obvious thing to lower the in -
flation target rather than raise it. Tailoring the 
definition of the monetary policy target to pre -
vailing circumstances would not only again be 
risking a loss of credibility; the ensuing debate 
about the advantages and disadvantages of 
raising the inflation target would also inevitably 
reflect those arguments which are relevant to lowering it. Lowering the targeted rate of infla -
tion would thus mainly increase the likelihood 
of a binding effective lower bound. A further 
point to consider is that such a fundamental 
change of monetary policy strategy should not 
be geared to the prevailing inflation environ -
ment. Rather, it calls for a comprehensive and 
self- contained appraisal of the relevant argu -
ments.
The following remarks therefore focus on the 
call for raising the targeted rate of inflation that 
is under discussion in the international con -
text.9 Given modern industrial countries’ limited 
experience of higher quantitative inflation tar -Proposal of

inflation targetnot necessarily have to be accompanied 
by production ineffi   ciencies.11
– Whereas monetary policy in a monetary 
union targets an average rate of infl  ation 
for the currency area as a whole, the 
member countries naturally have differ-
ent national infl  ation rates. Such differ-
ences between country- specifi  c infl  ation 
rates can be found when the business 
cycle is not synchronised across all mem-
ber countries.12 Those countries where 
economic activity is “more robust” than 
in the rest of the currency area tend to 
have higher infl  ation rates. Conversely, 
the countries where economic activity is 
slowing down tend to have lower rates 
of infl  ation. The infl  ation target for the 
monetary union as a whole should there-
fore be suffi   cient to protect those coun-
tries with below- average infl  ation rates 
from the threat of defl  ation. Even if monetary policy cannot resolve pro-
longed or even permanent infl  ation dif-
ferentials, the central bank should not 
hinder adjustments in the real economy 
by setting the infl  ation target too low.
11 For the sake of simplicity, the main article, on the 
other hand, assumes fi  rms have uniform productivity 
technologies. If all fi  rms are equally productive, infl  a-
tion results in production ineffi   ciencies.
12 For more information, see Z Enders, P Jung and 
G Müller (2013), Has the euro changed the business 
cycle?, European Economic Review, Vol 59, pp 189-
211. In addition, the level of development may also 
vary across the member countries. As part of the con-
vergence process, there is an increase in productivity 
and wages in the traded goods sector and subse-
quently in wages in the non- traded goods sector, too, 
which in turn puts pressure on the general price level. 
However, a number of studies indicate that this effect 
(called the Balassa- Samuelson effect) is not signifi  cant 
in the euro area. For more information, see B Égert 
(2011), Catching- up and infl  ation in Europe: Balassa-

Systems, Vol 35, pp 208-229; as well as ECB, Monet-
ary policy and infl  ation differentials in a heterogeneous 
currency area, Monthly Bulletin, May 2005, pp 65-82.
9 One argument that is frequently cited in the international 
debate as a justification for raising the target inflation rate 
is a potentially lower natural interest rate, as a result of 
which the effective lower bound, taken in isolation, would 
be binding more often; see K  Holston, T  Laubach and 
J C Williams (2017), Measuring the natural rate of interest: 
international trends and determinants, Journal of Inter -
national Economics, Vol 108, pp 59-75; and Deutsche Bun -

gets and their implications, conceptual and 
thus model- based considerations and analyses 
play a central role in the present article. Some 
simplifications have to be made so as to able to 
study the interaction of the cited aspects in a 
model in a consistent manner. For instance, 
non- standard monetary policy measures are 
not considered, and the key interest rate is 
assumed  to be the sole monetary policy instru -
ment.10
The choice of inflation target
It is widely accepted that monetary policy 
should be geared in particular to achieving 
price stability. In the longer term, price stability 
is a fundamental prerequisite for the smooth 
functioning of the economy, for sustained eco -
nomic growth and greater economic welfare.11 
Price stability makes it easier to distinguish rela -
tive price changes from changes in the general 
price level, which means that prices are better 
at signalling the relative scarcity of goods and 
services. This plays a significant part in eco -
nomic decision- making, leading to resources 
being allocated to where they can be used 
most productively – and thus efficiently.
Price stability also has additional, welfare-  
enhancing effects. With stable inflation rates, 
creditors have no reason to demand significant 
inflation risk premiums to compensate for hold -
ing nominal long-  term assets. The resulting, 
relatively lower interest rates increase the in -
centives for additional, growth- enhancing in -
vestment. Furthermore, firms can use their re -
sources for productive purposes, rather than 
employing at least some of them for hedging 
inflation risks. Similarly, stable inflation rates re -
duce distorting effects in the nominal tax and 
transfer system that stem from a lack of index -
ation. Finally, stable price developments reduce 
an implicit (inflation) taxation of cash holdings 
as well as an arbitrary redistribution of nominal 
incomes and wealth. Altogether, it follows 
from such efficiency considerations that the in -
flation target should basically be 0% because the welfare- enhancing effects of stable prices 
are then at their greatest.12
Owing to the efficiency gains associated with 
stable prices, the central banks of the industrial 
countries have made an explicit commitment 
to safeguarding price stability.13 Yet the quanti -
tative inflation targets in a host of currency 
areas are not 0%, but around 2% (see the chart 
on page 38). One of the key reasons for this, as 
will be explained in more detail below, is to cre -
ate a certain safety margin to guard against the 
risks of deflation.
The Governing Council of the ECB also targets 
a euro area inflation rate of below, but close to, 
2% in the medium term.14 Strictly speaking, 
therefore, the Eurosystem has not defined an 
explicit number for the target inflation rate, but 
has set a range of inflation rates that the Gov -
erning Council deems compatible with its no -
tion of price stability.15 This range does not rule 
out medium- term inflation rates of over 2% 
and a persistently falling price level – or, in 
other words, negative inflation rates.
The risk of deflation looms, in particular, when 
a general price drop becomes entrenched or Good monetary

10 Especially at the effective lower bound, asset purchase 
programmes are one way of providing additional monetary 
policy stimuli. For more on this subject, see the Annual Re -
port of the Deutsche Bundesbank for 1996 and Deutsche 
Bundesbank, Monthly Report, June 2016, op cit.
11 Price stability does not mean, however, that individual 
prices remain stable, as these have to change in a market 
economy in order to be able to respond to developments 
in supply and demand. Such price signals constitute im -
portant information for consumers and producers, who co -
ordinate their behaviour and help to create a balance be -
tween supply and demand.
12 This holds if it is assumed that the initial allocation is 
efficient to begin with. If it is not, the optimal inflation rate 
would not completely stabilise the relative prices, but 
would support the transition to an efficient allocation of 
resources; see, for example, T Yun (2005), Optimal monet -
ary policy with relative price distortions, American Eco -
nomic Review, 95, 89-109.
13 To an extent, the mandate of the Federal Reserve is one 
exception, as it gives the objective of maximum employ -
ment a prominent role alongside the objective of stable 
prices.

even self-  reinforcing because, for example, in -
flation expectations become unanchored on 
the downside. This kind of downward scenario 
could arise if monetary policy were to run out 
of effective instruments to counter such a de -
velopment. In running monetary policy, central 
banks are faced with an effective lower bound 
on interest rates, which is often defined as 0% 
for the sake of simplicity but is actually likely to 
be lower; as a result, their remaining room for 
monetary policy manoeuvring shrinks, all other 
things being equal, as the policy rate drops.16 
The lower bound therefore limits the scope to 
lower nominal (and hence real) interest rates, 
which means that once the effective lower 
bound has been reached, aggregate demand 
can no longer be stabilised sufficiently using 
the interest rate instrument.17 Although monet -
ary policy can still intervene to provide stimu -
lus, even at the lower bound, using alternative, 
non- standard measures, it is evident that a core 
stabilising instrument is lost once the effective 
lower bound has been reached.18 Thus, it is 
generally more difficult for a central bank to 
effect ively prevent a persistent deflationary 
phase than to counter a sustained increase in 
the inflation rate by raising interest rates as 
appro priate. The effective lower bound there -
fore plays a role in the fact that monetary pol -
icy stabilisation ability is subject to asymmetry.Compared with a target of 0%, a positive infla -
tion target provides a wider safety margin to 
the lower bound thanks to the higher average 
nominal interest rate level it entails, and thus 
– taken in isolation – reduces the risk of defla -
tion. Looking solely at the safety margin to the 
lower bound, this gives monetary policy 
broader scope for its stabilisation policy. How -Safety margin

16 As economic agents always have the option of exchan -
ging their deposits for cash, which has a 0% nominal inter -
est rate, they may switch to hoarding cash when faced 
with negative nominal interest rates. However, the experi -
ences of various central banks show that the effective 
lower bound is somewhat lower than 0%, because holding 
large quantities of cash also entails costs, such as the costs 
of storage or insurance. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Monet -
ary policy indicators at the lower bound based on term 
structure models, Monthly Report, September 2017, pp 13-
34.
17 The real interest rate is key to stabilising demand. When 
economic agents expect declining inflation or even defla -
tion, the real interest rate rises when taken in isolation (via 
the Fisher equation), slowing down investment and 
growth. The central bank can lower the real interest rate by 
reducing the nominal interest rate. If it is unable to make 
further interest rate cuts at the effective lower bound, the 
real interest rate is ultimately determined, approximately, 
by inflation expectations. This can produce a deflationary 
spiral, because the expectation of deflation pushes up the 
real interest rate, which in turn reduces demand and hence 
the inflation rate, potentially causing deflation to become 
entrenched.
18 In addition, it is unclear how effective unconventional 
measures are, compared with the conventional interest 
rate instrument, and on what scale unwanted side effects 
may materialise. These include, for example, increasing 
overlap between monetary and fiscal policy, risks to the 
profitability of financial institutions, and excessive risk-  
taking. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, June 
2016, op cit.Deutsche Bundesbank

Conceptual considerations regarding the macroeconomic 
implications of different infl  ation targets
Firms take various aspects into account 
when setting their prices. Put simply, there 
are three factors which stand out.
– First, they incorporate the current eco-
nomic environment and thus the (ex-
pected) demand for their goods into 
their calculations. If a fi  rm opts to meet 
an increased demand for its goods, the 
production costs increase with each add-
itional unit produced. Generally speak-
ing, it will then seek to pass on these 
higher costs to the customers by raising 
the sales prices so as to maintain its 
profi  t- maximising margin.
– However, owing to adjustment costs and 
other factors, a fi  rm will not immediately 
adjust its prices every time there is a fl  uc-
tuation in demand. Once a price has 
been set, it will therefore normally be 
valid for a certain period of time.1 Since 
fi  rms act in a forward- looking manner, 
they will already take this time dimension 
of their profi  t calculation into account 
when setting their prices today. Product 
prices therefore also partly refl  ect future 
expected demand.2
– Lastly, general price developments –  ie 
the level of the average infl  ation rate – 
play a pivotal role in choosing prices, as 
sales prices are not typically indexed to 
the infl  ation rate and thus the price (once 
set) erodes, in real terms, over time.3 
Since not all fi  rms adjust their prices with 
full fl  exibility in every period in response 
to fl  uctuations in demand, there are dif-
ferences between the relative prices of 
individual fi  rms.4
To sum up, a fi  rm’s price setting therefore 
depends on the current and expected de-mand for its goods as well as on the ex-
pected infl  ation rate. Aggregating these 
microeconomic decisions results in the ag-
gregate supply curve. This (New Keynesian) 
Phillips curve describes – from a macroeco-
nomic perspective  – the relationship be-
tween the current infl  ation rate, the current 
aggregate output gap5 and infl  ation ex-
pectations. In formal terms, the (log- linear) 
Phillips curve for positive target infl  ation is 
composed of an equation for describing the 
infl  ation rate

1 This form of price stickiness contributes signifi  cantly 
to economic decisions being taken that lead to re-
sources not being allocated to where they can be em-
ployed most productively – and thus effi   ciently.
2 It is usually assumed that economic agents do not 
make any systematic errors when forming their expect-
ations and that they use all of the information that is 
available to them. They thus form their expectations in 
a rational and model- consistent manner.
3 Studies for the United States, for instance, indicate 
that prices are only incompletely indexed (if at all) to 
the average rate of infl  ation because they do not ad-
just in every period. See E Nakamura und J Steinsson 
(2008), Five facts about prices: a reevaluation of menu 
cost models, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 
Vol 123(4), pp 1415-1464, and T Cogley and A M Sbor-

can Economic Review, Vol 98(5), pp 2101-2126.

more, ˆ�t represents the marginal costs and 
Aˆt productivity, again relative to their long- 
term equilibrium values. Lastly, �t repre-
sents an exogenous process (shock to the 
labour supply). The notation x(¯ �) makes it 
clear that individual parameters of the Phil-
lips curve are directly dependent on the 
level of the target infl  ation rate. Both the 
position and the slope of the Phillips curve 
are therefore directly dependent on the 
level of the target infl  ation rate (see the 
chart above).
In the special case of an infl  ation target of

duced to a single equation:

.
Given higher average infl  ation rates, it is es-
pecially the relative importance of the ex-pected price level – and thus the expected 
infl  ation rate – that increases for fi  rms when 
choosing their profi  t- maximising prices. The 
lack of price indexation means that the 
nominal sales price and thus the purchasing 
power of the nominal profi  ts erode faster 
when the average rate of infl  ation is higher. 
Firms take the associated fall in the profi  t 
margin into account in their price- setting 
calculations and adjust their prices more 
strongly to compensate.7 This has two 
macroeconomic implications:
– First, the differences in relative prices be-
tween fi  rms increase. The associated 
larger shifts in demand lead to adjust-
ments in the volume of goods produced 
by the fi  rms if not all fi  rms are entirely 
fl  exible in adjusting their prices to fl  uctu-
ations in demand.8 But these shifts in de-
mand induced by price stickiness are ac-
companied by production ineffi   ciencies.9 
Such ineffi   ciencies become even larger 
with higher rates of price increase, ie 
given a higher target infl  ation rate.
6 See G Ascari und A M Sbordone (2014), The macro-
economics of trend infl  ation, Journal of Economic Lit-
erature, Vol 52, pp 679-739.
7 This makes it harder for economic agents to distin-
guish relative price changes from changes in the gen-
eral price level.
8 For the sake of simplicity, the literature normally 
posits a Calvo price- setting mechanism, assuming that, 
in each period, fi  rms only have a given, exogenously 
determined, probability of being able to change the 
price of their product. Goods prices are therefore not 
perfectly fl  exible and are, to a certain degree, sticky.

ics, Vol 12, pp 383-398.

which the end products are composed of a weighted 
mean of intermediate goods. In the prototypical new 
Keynesian framework it is assumed, for the sake of 
simplicity, that all fi  rms have a uniform production 
technology. On grounds of effi   ciency, it is therefore 
optimal if all fi  rms produce the same volume of goods.

– Second, in relative terms demand be-
comes less important for fi  rms’ price set-
ting, as they now give a stronger weight-
ing to the infl  ation path. This means that 
when the target infl  ation rate is higher, 
the current output gap loses some of its 
importance as a determinant of the infl  a-
tion rate, making the Phillips curve, fi  g-
uratively speaking, fl  atter (see the chart 
on page 40).
These two implications of a higher target 
infl  ation make it harder for monetary pol-
icymakers to stabilise the economy and 
thus ensure price stability because it is ul-
timately through its effect on aggregate de-
mand that monetary policy infl  uences the 
infl  ation rate.10 With a higher target infl  a-
tion rate, the Phillips curve is fl  atter and 
aggreg ate demand, taken in isolation, is 
accord ingly less important as a determinant 
of price developments. As a result, the price 
adjustment in the wake of an interest rate 
hike is less pronounced. In line with this, in 
the event of an economic downturn, a cut 
in interest rates has less of an effect on ag-
gregate demand than it would if the infl  a-
tion rate were lower. Or, to put it another 
way, in order to bring about a necessary 
change or desired correction to the infl  ation 
rate, larger changes to the monetary policy 
interest rate are required. But when major 
interest rate adjustments become neces-
sary, the zero lower bound, taken in isol-
ation, narrows monetary policymakers’ 
room for manoeuvre.11
We can conclude from the discussion above 
that it is a priori not absolutely certain that 
the room for manoeuvre created by a 
higher target infl  ation rate actually helps to 
improve monetary policy’s capacities for 
stabilisation. Once the infl  ation rate target 
reaches a certain level, the increased room 
for manoeuvre associated with a larger 
safety margin to the lower interest rate bound can actually backfi  re – not just be-
cause of the greater interest rate adjust-
ments that become necessary, but also, and 
in particular, on account of the increasing 
price dispersion that comes with a higher 
target infl  ation rate and which is a crucial 
factor in economic decisions being taken 
that lead to resources not being allocated 
to where they can be employed most pro-
ductively.
10 This is why the infl  ation rate falls following a rise in 
interest rates: the associated dampening of economic 
activity prompts fi  rms to raise their prices less sharply 
so as to boost demand for their products.
11 Too small an adjustment of interest rates heightens 
the risk of self- fulfi  lling expectations and – linked to 
this – multiple equilibrium paths. These arise if, for ex-
ample, a rise in infl  ation expectations that is not justi-
fi  ed by the fundamentals leads to a rise in the actual 
infl  ation rate on account of an inadequate monetary 
policy response so that the original expectations are 
“validated” ex post. In this sense, infl  ation expect-
ations are then no longer fi  rmly anchored. In the 
prototypical version of the new Keynesian model, the 
Taylor principle is a suffi   cient criterion for ruling out 
such self- fulfi  lling expectations. See R Clarida, J Gali 
und M  Gertler (2000), Monetary policy rules and 
macroeconomic stability: evidence and some theory, 
The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol  115(1), 
pp 147-180. This does not necessarily hold true with 
higher target infl  ation rates because the fl  atter Phillips 
curve means that a given interest rates move will have 
less of an impact on the actual infl  ation rate. To offset 
the reduced effectiveness of a given interest rate im-
pulse and thus ensure stability, the central bank thus 
has to adjust its monetary policy rule and take more 
decisive interest rate measures. For more details, see

principle, and indeterminacy, Journal of Money, Credit 
and Banking, Vol 41, pp 1557-1584, examining the oc-
currence of self- fulfi  lling expectations depending on 
the monetary policy response for different target infl  a-
tion rates. Nevertheless, even when the monetary pol-
icy response is adjusted specifi  cally in the case of 
(model) uncertainty, the risk of infl  ation expectations 
becoming unanchored fundamentally continues to 
exist. See also T A Lubik and C Matthes (2016), Indeter-

ever, these are not the only possible implica -
tions of a higher inflation target. Amongst 
other things, the level of an inflation target, 
and thus the average rate of price increase, in -
fluences the price- setting behaviour of firms 
and consequently the monetary policy trans -
mission process (see the box on pages 39 to 41).
Target inflation rate – 
a trade- off decision
Thus far, this article has outlined why, on the 
one hand, an inflation rate of 0% results in the 
greatest possible allocative efficiency given the 
existing considerations. On the other hand, the 
lower bound restricts monetary policy’s ability 
to stabilise the economy, especially when the 
use of unconventional monetary policy meas -
ures (as assumed so far) is not taken into ac -
count. In principle, a higher inflation target can 
therefore provide greater leeway. Thus, a posi -
tive target inflation rate not only gives rise to costs (in the sense of the aforementioned pro -
duction inefficiencies), but also brings a benefit 
in the form of a reduced risk of deflation.
As such, the choice of an appropriate target 
inflation rate can ultimately be seen as the out -
come of a trade- off. To examine this kind of 
trade- off process in greater depth, relevant 
model analyses have to be conducted, in which 
different inflation targets and their macroeco -
nomic effects can be compared.19 The adjacent 
chart shows what this trade- off might look 
like, based on costs in the form of production 
inefficiencies (caused by nominal rigidities and 
associated price dispersion) and the benefit in 
the form of a greater safety margin to the 
lower bound. The result is an optimal target in -
flation rate in low positive territory, typically 
around the 2% mark.
The case for low positive target inflation rates 
despite a binding lower bound is ultimately 
founded in the fact that, at least until the finan -
cial crisis, the lower bound was historically a 
rather rare and relatively short- lived phenom -
enon.20 Even though this means that a period 
with a binding lower bound entails sizeable 
economic costs in principle, the permanent 
effi ciency gains of low inflation rates outweigh 
these on average.
Experience gained during the financial crisis has 
shown, however, that the lower bound can be 
binding for long periods – longer than was 
considered realistic or plausible before the cri -
sis.21 In turn, the duration of a binding lower

bound affects the trade- off, as less room for 
monetary policy manoeuvring due to a longer 
binding lower bound is associated with greater 
macroeconomic costs.22 On its own, a longer 
average episode of a binding lower bound 
might therefore suggest that it could make 
sense to raise the inflation target.
This kind of isolated analysis neglects two key 
aspects, however. First, the greater scope for 
action  created by a higher inflation target is sim -
ultaneously limited because the higher inflation 
target makes it necessary for a stronger interest 
policy response to safeguard price stability. Fur -
thermore, higher target inflation rates entail 
stronger distortions (see the box on pages 39 
to 41). In the terminology of the New Keynesian 
model, a higher inflation target is said to “shift” 
the Phillips curve of the economy (making it 
“flatter”) and distortions caused by higher price 
dispersion increase. As these aspects  gain in im -
portance, the argument of greater room for 
manoeuvre becomes less persuasive.
A second aspect that is often neglected in the 
cost- benefit trade- off concerns the key role of 
inflation expectations. Higher target inflation 
rates mean higher inflation expectations. 
Whether these actually remain anchored at the 
new level when the target inflation rate is 
raised is not apparent, however. But since the 
firm anchoring of inflation expectations is cen -
tral from a monetary policy perspective, the risk 
of inflation expectations potentially becoming 
unanchored due to higher target inflation rates 
is subsequently pushed to the foreground.
The possible risk of an 
unanchoring  of inflation 
expectations 
Economic agents’ inflation expectations play a 
prominent role for monetary policy because ex -
pectations affect the setting of wages and 
prices by the individual economic agents and 
are thus themselves an important determinant 
of the path of inflation. If inflation expectations are not firmly anchored, it is harder to stabilise 
the inflation rate. In a worst- case scenario, the 
central bank would fail to achieve its inflation 
target even in the medium term.
As will be shown below, a higher inflation tar -
get can increase the probability of inflation ex -
pectations becoming unanchored and, in ex -
treme cases, result in them being inconsistent 
with the central bank’s new target even in the 
long term.23
Whether or not inflation expectations become 
unanchored, which is to say that they deviate 
from the target inflation rate over the long 
term, crucially hinges on how these expect -
ations are formed. Therefore, the first thing to 
consider is how expectations are formed (and 
thus, ultimately, how to model them).24 Using 
these considerations in the New Keynesian 
analytical framework, it is possible to illustrate 
the costs of a higher target inflation rate which 
could arise if doubts materialise over the cred -
ibility of monetary policy.

lower bound than Coibion et al (2012), although the meth -
odological implementation of each approach differs. Both 
studies show that a longer duration implies a higher opti -
mal inflation rate, as expected.
23 Influential monetary policymakers have voiced such 
fears, including Ben Bernanke, although he put this down 
to the loss of credibility caused by changing the inflation 
target. This could arise because central banks had invested 
a great deal of time in anchoring inflation expectations at 
2%. Even if the target was raised only moderately from 2% 
to 4%, he feared that this could raise doubts about the 
credibility of a stated inflation target. Economic agents 
might ask themselves why, if the target can be hiked to 
4%, it could not also be hiked to 6%. Bernanke felt that 
this kind of scenario would hinder the effective steering of 
inflation expectations. See B S  Bernanke, The economic 
outlook and monetary policy, Speech at the Federal Re -
serve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson 
Hole, Wyoming, 27 August 2010, Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System.
24 These considerations are confined to the conceptual 
level since the leading central banks of the industrial coun -
tries only aim for low inflation rates. There are no target 
inflation rates in the order of, say, 4% or more, rendering it 
effectively impossible to make estimates based on empir -
ical findings.Deutsche Bundesbank

Generally, economic agents can form their in -
flation expectations by various ways and 
means. For example, they could form their ex -
pectations in a forward- looking way based on 
all information available to them. In doing so, 
they are ideally aware of the underlying macro -
economic relationships (including all the rele -
vant probability distributions) and can form 
their expectations on this basis, without mak -
ing systematic errors – in this sense, they be -
have “rationally”. Given rational expectations, a 
credible central bank is able to effectively steer 
the inflation expectations of economic agents 
by announcing its monetary policy strategy. To 
the economic agents, the level of the inflation 
target forms part of the available information 
to be factored into the formation of their ex -
pectations. A key condition for the effective 
steering of these expectations is the credibility 
of the central bank.25 If these conditions are 
met and assuming there is no binding lower 
bound,26 inflation expectations formed in a ra -
tional way will normally match the central 
bank’s inflation target over the long term and, 
in this sense, will always be firmly anchored.27
However, rational expectations are a textbook 
case of expectations formation that is unlikely 
to predominate in practice. For one thing, it 
would appear doubtful whether economic 
agents do indeed have all the relevant informa -
tion about macroeconomic relationships (eg 
owing to the cost of procuring information). In 
practice, therefore, expectations are likely to be 
formed in different ways. For instance, eco -
nomic agents might base their expectations 
more on past events. It is precisely because 
they only have incomplete information that 
they rely more heavily on past economic devel -
opments for guidance so they can only form a 
picture of the economic correlations in this 
way. In economic theory, this type of expect -
ations formation can be described using the 
adaptive learning approach.28 According to this 
approach, a new, higher inflation target will 
not be fully factored into the formation of infla -
tion expectations at first, but needs to be 
“learned” over time from the observed inflation rates. As will be discussed below, it is then gen -
erally possible for economic agents to form in -
flation expectations that are not consistent 
with the central bank’s inflation target in the 
long term, meaning that they are effectively 
unanchored.29
If economic agents increasingly base their ex -
pectations on past observations, the central 
bank must first have implemented its decisions 
so that these decisions, along with their im -
pact, become “visible” and thus learnable for 
… whether 
expectations 
can become 
unanchored,  …… and how 
effective 
monetary  policy 
measures are
25 See, for example, the discussion in R Clarida, J Galí and 
M Gertler (1999), The science of monetary policy: a New 
Keynesian perspective, Journal of Economic Literature, 
Vol 37(4), pp 1661-1707 on optimal monetary policy with 
commitment and under discretion. Based on a New 
Keynesian model, the authors show that credibility gives 
monetary policy the ability to effectively “accommodate” 
exogenous shocks over a longer period. Where there is a 
lack of credibility, shocks lead to stronger economic losses.
26 Additionally, a “suboptimal” monetary policy is disre -
garded, which, under the assumption of rational expect -
ations, can go hand in hand with the existence of multiple 
equilibria.
27 Accordingly, a situation in which economic agents do 
not believe in the long- term inflation target and where 
their inflation expectations do not match the central bank’s 
inflation target over the long term – which is to say, infla -
tion expectations are unanchored – is incompatible with 
the concept of rational expectations.
28 This approach typically assumes that although the 
agents are generally familiar with the structure of the econ -
omy, they are not aware of its underlying structural param -
eters. See G W Evans and S Honkapohja (2001), Learning 
and expectations in macroeconomics, Princeton University 
Press; and S Eusepi and B Preston (2018), The science of 
monetary policy: an imperfect knowledge perspective, 
Journal of Economic Literature, 56 (1), pp 3-59.
29 In this context, it is assumed that the economic agents 
behave like econometricians, basing their forecasts on the 
perceived law of motion (PLM), which (in the simplest case) 
has the same structure as the minimal state variable (MSV) 
solution that can be derived under the assumption of 
rational  expectations (see: B T McCallum (1983), On non-  
uniqueness in rational expectations models: an attempt at 
perspective, Journal of Monetary Economics, 11(2), pp 139-
168). Using this approach, they forecast the future path of 
inflation based on existing observations. In each period for 
which additional data become available, the agents review 
their forecast model and modify it accordingly in order to 
form their expectations for the next period.Deutsche Bundesbank

the economic agents.30 As a result, the central 
bank can no longer influence the path of infla -
tion directly by steering inflation expectations, 
but only “indirectly” via its impact on macro -
economic developments.
Because adaptive learning means that central 
bank announcements of changes to monetary 
policy strategy – such as the communication of 
a higher target inflation rate – can no longer 
directly influence the formation of inflation ex -
pectations and thus the current inflation rate, 
the inflation expectations of learning economic 
agents will tend to respond less dynamically 
than under rational expectations. In this way 
the effectiveness of conventional monetary 
policy measures is reduced.31
Beyond the hypothesis of learning agents, a 
higher target inflation rate changes the stabil -
isation capacities of monetary policy because 
the Phillips curve –  as outlined above in the 
context of rational expectations – flattens given 
a higher average rate of inflation (see the box 
on pages 39 to 41).32 Since, under the adaptive 
learning approach, monetary policy interest 
rate stimuli only have an effect on the inflation 
rate via developments in the overall economy, 
but economic activity has less of an impact on 
the current path of inflation when the target 
inflation rate is higher and the Phillips curve is 
flatter, the effectiveness of the conventional 
interest rate instrument on the inflation rate 
decreases when target inflation rates are 
higher. And when the central bank can exert 
less influence on the actual path of inflation, 
this raises the risk of inflation expectations be -
coming unanchored.33 This becomes a particu -
lar risk if, when the actual inflation rate devi -
ates from the inflation target, the monetary 
policy interest rate response is not strong 
enough to steer the inflation rate back towards 
the inflation target via a corresponding change 
in the real interest rate. Absent sufficient stabil -
isation, inflation expectations could then di -
verge from the inflation target over the long 
run as well, leaving them unanchored in a Higher target 
inflation rate 
increases 
the risk of 
unanchoring …30 Under the learning approach, in each period, agents 
update the coefficients of the PLM, (typically) by estimating 
and updating them using the recursive least squares 
method. They learn from past (forecasting) errors by com -
paring their forecast with newly added observations in 
order to obtain a new (improved) forecast. Individual ap -
proaches often differ when it comes to the weighting of 
new data for the purpose of determining the coefficients 
of the PLM. In the decreasing gain algorithm, all observa -
tions are given the same weighting, meaning that the in -
formation gain from a new observation decreases relative 
to the previous observations. By contrast, in the constant 
gain algorithm, past observations are discounted, meaning 
that the information gain from a new observation remains 
constant in comparison to the previous observations. Fur -
thermore, the underlying structure of the learning process, 
too, can adapt over time; see, for example, J  Arifovic, 
S Schmitt- Grohé and M Uribe (2018), Learning to live in a 
liquidity trap, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,

31 Here, as in the following remarks, the lower bound is 
disregarded for the sake of simplicity.
32 The following information is based on the anticipated 
utility approach, in which subjective decisions are made 
under the assumption that the subjective expectations do 
not change, even though they are in effect renewed in 
each period. The explicit inclusion of a potential revision of 
future expectations would be reflected in today’s decision 
by way of the associated uncertainty. In more complex 
model structures, however, it would be very difficult as 
things stand, if not impossible, to implement an approach 
such as this. However, highly simplified models can be used 
to show that the anticipated utility approach is a fairly 
good approximation. See, for example, T  Cogley and 
T J Sargent (2008), Anticipated utility and rational expect -
ations as approximations of Bayesian decision making, 
International Economic Review, 49(1), pp  185-221; and 
S Eusepi and B Preston (2018), The science of monetary 
policy: an imperfect knowledge perspective, Journal of 
Economic Literature, 56 (1), pp 3-59.
33 The type of unanchoring very much depends on the 
underlying assumed formation of expectations. In the case 
of rational expectations, unanchoring is characterised by 
the emergence of self- fulfilling expectations. Given that 
economic agents nonetheless tend to act rationally and 
thus continue to regard the structure of the economy (as 
well as the inflation target) as plausible, they will bring their 
expectations (in the context of a local analysis) into line 
with the inflation target over the long term. By contrast, 
according to the adaptive learning approach, inflation ex -
pectations formed on the basis of forecasting are com -
pared to the inflation target in the long term. Only if the 
expectations match the target inflation rate (to a sufficient 
degree) will inflation expectations be considered to be an -
chored.Deutsche Bundesbank

sense.34 As a result, then, it would be possible 
for inflation expectations to still be anchored 
given a low inflation target, but for a higher 
target rate of inflation – for a given monetary 
policy rule – to cause this anchoring to be lost 
because of the associated reduced effective -
ness of the interest rate stimulus.
To still generally be able to steer the inflation 
rate in the “right direction” when the inflation 
target is higher, and thus prevent inflation ex -
pectations from becoming unanchored, the 
central bank will therefore need to adapt its 
monetary policy response. For the sake of sim -
plicity, this is formulated in the following as a 
prototypical Taylor rule. This rule describes how 
monetary policymakers set the nominal interest 
rate ˆit (as a deviation from the long- term equi -
librium) depending on changes in the real eco -
nomic situation ˆyt (typically in the form of the 
output gap) and the deviation of the inflation 
rate from the inflation target (ˆ�t = �t – ¯�):
ˆit=φ⇡ˆ⇡t+φyˆyt
where �� and �y represent the respective 
monetary policy response coefficients. Since 
both response coefficients are greater than 0 
(consistent with the literature), the interest rate 
rises if, for example, the inflation rate is higher 
than the target value (ˆ�t > 0). If the target in -
flation rate ¯� rises, the central bank, prompted 
by the change in firms’ price- setting behaviour 
and the flatter Phillips curve this creates, has to 
respond more “aggressively” to deviations of 
the inflation rate from the inflation target and 
select a higher �� accordingly.35 Therefore, it 
can prevent the inflation rate from potentially 
drifting away from the target by making larger 
interest rate moves.36 Furthermore, when the 
target inflation rate is higher, it should smooth 
any fluctuations in macroeconomic develop -
ments more gently and select a lower �y ac-
cordingly.37 An adjustment like this would, in 
principle, allow the central bank to steer the 
inflation rate effectively even if a higher target 
rate of inflation has been set.38… if monetary 
policymakers do 
not respond 
more aggres -
sively to inflation 34 In the learning approach, the actual law of motion 
(ALM) is created once the agents have formed their sub -
jective expectations (using their forecasting model, the 
PLM) and made their decisions on this basis. The ALM 
therefore describes the stochastic process which the econ -
omy follows if expectations are formed on the basis of the 
PLM. The ALM is thus dependent on the PLM. The esti -
mated coefficients of the PLM produce the coefficients of 
the ALM, which depend on the estimated parameters 
themselves as well as other model parameters (that are un -
known to agents) such as the inflation target. This process, 
from the estimated coefficients of the PLM to the resulting 
coefficients of the ALM, can be interpreted as a mathemat -
ical mapping process known as the “T- map”. The condition 
for a stable equilibrium (“e- stability”) is met whenever the 
MSV solution is a fixed point of the T-  map because this 
means that the equilibrium under rational expectations is 
learnable in the long term and thus stable.
35 If price stability is interpreted as meaning zero inflation, 
the Taylor principle, which states that adjustments to nom -
inal interest rates should be greater than the divergence of 
the inflation rate from the inflation target, is a sufficient 
criterion for macroeconomic stability when viewed from a 
rational expectations perspective. With a positive inflation 
target, this no longer applies because higher accompany -
ing inflation rates diminish the effectiveness of conven -
tional interest rate moves. Given a monetary policy rule, 
then, an increase in nominal interest rates according to the 
Taylor principle might no longer be sufficient, for example, 
to prevent an unexpected rise in the inflation rate: the Tay -
lor principle would therefore effectively be “too weak” if 
the target inflation rate were positive. Hence the need, 
when the target inflation rate is positive, for the central 
bank to adjust the nominal interest rate more aggressively 
than suggested by the Taylor principle, ie the response co -
efficient to deviations in the inflation rate from the inflation 
target needs to be greater. See O Coibion and Y Gorod -
nichenko (2011), Monetary policy, trend inflation and the 
great moderation: an alternative interpretation, American 
Economic Review, Vol 101, pp 341-370.
36 Frequent and more pronounced interest rate fluctu -
ations are associated with an increased likelihood of reach -
ing the lower bound, which is linked per se  to losses in 
stability and therefore welfare losses. In addition, high 
levels of interest rate volatility will probably prevent house -
holds from making (optimal) consumption and savings de -
cisions. As a rule, monetary policymakers should therefore 
look to avoid unnecessary interest rate volatility and aim for 
a certain degree of continuity (referred to as “history de -
pendence”); see M Woodford (2001), The Taylor rule and 
optimal monetary policy, American Economic Review, 
Papers and Proceedings, 91(2), pp 232-237.
37 Intuitively, the central bank will attempt to prevent eco -
nomic variables diverging from the target value by making 
a more aggressive interest rate response. Because monet -
ary policy can only steer the inflation rate via macroeco -
nomic developments in the context of adaptive learning, it 
would be counterproductive to smooth the business cycle 
aggressively because this would run counter to its influence 
on inflation. See G Ascari, A Florio and A Gobbi (2017), 
Transparency, expectations anchoring and inflation target, 
European Economic Review, Vol 91, pp 261-273.
38 However, if a lower bound were explicitly included (it 
having been excluded owing to methodological complex -
ity), stabilisation could be complicated or, at worst, be pre -
vented altogether if the central bank can no longer cut 
interest rates strongly enough and if unconventional meas -
ures are disregarded.Deutsche Bundesbank

The risk of inflation expectations becoming un -
anchored due to a higher target inflation rate 
and the resulting adjustment that would need 
to be made to monetary policy strategy can be 
illustrated graphically (see the chart above). 
Here, based on the New Keynesian model, dif -
ferent monetary policy rules are compared 
which differ from each other in terms of how 
strongly they respond to changes in output 
(plotted on the vertical axis) and inflation (plot -
ted on the horizontal axis). The area is coloured 
blue where a given monetary policy rule is suf -
ficient to anchor inflation expectations under 
otherwise identical economic conditions, 
otherwise it is grey. One can see that the area 
in which expectations are anchored shrinks sig -
nificantly when a target inflation rate of 4%, 
say, is assumed, rather than 2%. This is due to 
the more aggressive response to changes in the 
inflation rate (shift in strength of response to 
the right), which is necessary for anchoring 
when there is a higher target rate of inflation, 
and the less aggressive response to output (shift in strength of response downwards). Even 
though the area of anchored expectations does 
not disappear altogether in this illustration, the 
central bank is exposed to the risk that its mon -
etary policy response may be insufficient for 
anchoring in light of the existing (model) un -
certainty, which would be depicted in the chart 
by the fact that it would no longer be possible 
to clearly identify the outlines of each area.39Impact of the inflation target on the anchoring of inflation expectations
Source:  Bundesbank  chart  based  on  Ascari,  Florio  and  Gobbi  (2017),  Transparency,  expectations  anchoring  and  inflation  target, 
European Economic Review, Vol 91, pp 261-273. Areas in which inflation expectations are anchored (blue) and unanchored (grey) 
shown in relation to the strength of the response in the monetary policy rule to deviations in output and inflation from their respective 
equilibrium values for a target inflation rate of 2% and 4%, respectively. Higher response values indicate a more aggressive interest rate 
response. For example, a value of 1 means that when inflation rates exceed the target by 1 percentage point, interest rates increase by 
1 percentage point (viewed in isolation).

39 The areas are affected by the choice of assumed mon -

model economy (including the model parameters). The 
central bank therefore cannot mechanistically ensure an -

authors trace the cause of the volatile growth in the United

The role of communication 
and transition to a new 
inflation  target
So far in this article, it has been assumed that 
the learning economic agents (initially) do not 
believe the central bank’s communication to be 
credible and that, for that very reason alone, 
the higher target inflation rate does not have a 
direct impact on inflation expectations. How -
ever, a transparency-  enhancing approach to 
communication could generally help forge a 
deeper understanding of monetary policy, es -
pecially in a situation where economic agents 
have no more than incomplete information on 
macroeconomic relationships. This ought to 
have a positive impact on the anchoring of in -
flation expectations.40
Ideally, credible communication would be able 
to prevent the risk of inflation expectations po -
tentially becoming unanchored.41 Model simu -
lations carried out in this regard do indeed 
point to the beneficial role which communica -
tion plays in anchoring inflation expectations 
because it enhances the effectiveness of mon -
etary policy, all other things being equal.42 
Communicating additional (beneficial) informa -
tion on the aims and strategy of monetary 
policy makers thus makes it easier to steer infla -
tion on its path towards the inflation target.43 
This does not eliminate the risk of unanchoring 
altogether, however. This is again due to the 
mechanism described above, which, by flatten -
ing the Phillips curve, persists in curbing the 
central bank’s stabilisation capacities in spite of 
the transparency. As a result, the costs of higher 
target inflation rates remain even if communi -
cation is more intensive.
Thus far, this article has confined itself to com -
paring situations in which target inflation rates 
differ over the long term – that is to say, explicit 
consideration has not yet been given to the 
transition from a low inflation target to a higher 
one (eg from 2% to 4%). Model calculations 
on this topic show that this kind of transition 
may unintentionally result in high inflation rates.44 These analyses point to the risk that an 
increase in the inflation target may cause infla -
tion expectations to diverge very persistently 
from the new inflation target, accompanied by 
periods of very high inflation that exceed the 
inflation target. However, the longer a period 
of divergent inflation rates persists, the more 
likely it will be that the central bank’s credibility 
will suffer. This would reduce the effectiveness 
of monetary policy stabilisation measures still 
further and again increase the risk of unan -
choring.Even good 
(transparent) 
communication 
cannot rule out 
potential 
unanchoring  of 
inflation rates
Credibility at risk 
if inflation is not 
anchored to 
new target in 
time40 Transparent and “good” communication generally helps 
a central bank to stabilise aggregate demand. Explicit an -
nouncements by central banks regarding their monetary 
policy objectives and strategy can reduce uncertainty in 
the economy, increase the credibility of central banks and 
thus make it easier to anchor inflation expectations. See 
C J Erceg  and A T Levin (2003), Imperfect credibility and in -
flation persistence, Journal of Monetary Economics, 
Vol 50(4), pp 915-944.
41 See, in particular, L Ball (2014), The case for a long- run 
inflation target of four percent, IMF Working Papers 14/ 92.
42 See G Ascari, A Florio and A Gobbi (2017), Transpar -
ency, expectations anchoring and inflation target, Euro -
pean Economic Review, Vol  91, pp  261-273. This study 
presents two distinct scenarios with respect to the degree 
of transparency. In the first, the economic agents are un -
aware of the monetary policy response function, meaning 
they also have to draw up an interest rate forecast as well 
as an output and inflation forecast. In the second (transpar -
ent) scenario, the central bank reveals its response func -
tion, meaning there is no need for an interest rate forecast. 
This reduces (forecast) uncertainty, and the central bank 
increases its influence on the path of inflation.
43 Since, in the assumed context, economic agents have 
incomplete information about the economy, they still have 
to forecast the macroeconomic impact on inflation and 
output caused by monetary policy interest rate stimuli, 
even if they do in fact have knowledge of these stimuli. The 
criterion of anchoring is then only met, however, once in -
flation expectations match the inflation target over the 
long run.
44 See W A Branch and G W Evans (2017), Unstable infla -
tion targets, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 
Vol 49(4), pp 767-806. The authors assume an increase in 
the inflation target from 2% to 4%. As the private sector 
initially has incomplete information about the new target 
level or the central bank’s commitment to the new target, 
it has to “learn” the inflation target based on past out -
comes. After the central bank has announced that it will 
raise its target, it conducts an interest policy conducive to 
raising inflation to the new target level. Over time, the 
higher inflation rate is also reflected in the private sector’s 
inflation forecasts, though the agents (falsely) assume that 
the target will continue to be adjusted upwards. This 
assump tion materialises when the inflation rate rises far be -
yond the target to as high as 8% before ultimately conver -
ging towards the desired inflation rate of 4%, as originally 
intended.Deutsche Bundesbank

Additional considerations
Calls to raise the inflation target can only be 
classified and assessed on the basis of a com -
prehensive and detailed cost-  benefit analysis. 
Most of the analyses available consider only 
some aspects, however, such as comparing the 
efficient allocation of resources when inflation 
is low with the greater room for manoeuvre for 
monetary policymakers given the lower bound 
when inflation is higher, or they focus on the 
risk of unanchoring without, however, explicitly 
taking the lower bound into account.45 One 
major hurdle, then, is the lack of a uniform 
analytical framework that covers all aspects, 
includ ing the benefits and drawbacks, simul -
taneously, thus facilitating a comprehensive 
assess ment along these lines. Since the effects 
of a higher inflation target that have been out -
lined are, to a large extent, based solely on 
selected , albeit important, factors, there should 
also be a final brief discussion of other aspects 
that have not been afforded explicit consider -
ation in this article so far.
As explained above, positive inflation rates are 
accompanied by production inefficiencies, the 
extent of which, however, is affected by firms’ 
price- setting behaviour.46 If the model simula -
tions generally assume a higher degree of price 
flexibility given greater volatility in demand or a 
higher average rate of inflation, firms will ad -
just their prices more quickly and more fre -
quently.47 This reduces the differences in rela -
tive prices in the economy caused by a positive 
inflation rate, reducing the intensity of ineffi -
cient shifts in demand since firms make adjust -
ments not only to quantities but to prices as 
well. Therefore, when prices are adjusted more 
frequently, it is generally possible to reduce the 
production inefficiencies caused by higher in -
flation rates on average. Taken by itself, this 
would, in principle, suggest that the optimal 
inflation target is higher.
Another caveat that should be borne in mind 
when considering the points made thus far is 
that this article assumes that central banks have a narrow set of policy tools focused exclu -
sively on short- term interest rates. As a result, 
once policy rates have reached the effective 
lower bound, monetary policy cannot provide 
further stabilising impetus. In reality, however, 
central banks have responded in a variety of 
ways at the lower bound, stabilising aggregate 
growth not least by using unconventional mon -
etary policy measures. These include both the 
asset purchase programmes and long- term refi -
nancing operations. Fraught with long- term 
risks and hotly debated though these measures 
are, they do put the significance of the lower 
bound into perspective when viewed in isol -
ation and thus reduce the need for a higher 
inflation target.
Furthermore, the improvements to financial 
regulation initiated during the crisis and the 
introduction of a new policy area (specifically, 
macroprudential policy) ought to have dimin -
ished the likelihood of future financial crises 
and thus the probability of reaching the lower 
bound, which alone reduces the need to in -
crease the inflation target still further.
In addition to the aforementioned reasons 
worth considering in the trade- off surrounding 
a target inflation rate, there are still more fac -
tors which could gainsay any increase in the 
inflation target. For example, surveys suggest 
that the public generally do not favour exces -Conclusive 
assessment not 
yet possible 
because, inter 
alia, …
… most com -
monly assumed 
price- setting 
models are not 
beyond 
dispute , …… uncon-
ventional 
monetary  policy 
measures are 
disregarded,  …
… and public 
aversion to high 
inflation rates 
remains ignored
45 For example, in Coibion et al (2012), anchoring is al -
ways guaranteed in the long and short term because they 
assume rational expectations and exclude multiple equilib -
ria.
46 In the literature, the Calvo pricing model has emerged 
as the standard method for describing price stickiness. 
There are good reasons to doubt the plausibility of this 
type of model, however, because it assumes, for example, 
that firms lack the possibility to adjust their prices more 
frequently when inflation is higher. Thus far, this article has 
assumed that the intervals between a firm’s price adjust -
ments when inflation is positive are exactly the same as 
when inflation is zero.
47 Menu cost models, for example, imply a more frequent 
adjustment of prices. See E Nakamura, J Steinsson, P Sun 
and D Villar (2017), The elusive costs of inflation: price dis -
persion during the U.S. great inflation, Quarterly Journal of 
Economics, forthcoming. However, this type of pricing has 
thus far attracted little coverage in the literature, and in 
particular there has not been sufficient analysis of the issue 
of unanchoring in this context.Deutsche Bundesbank

sively high inflation rates.48 The welfare costs of 
higher inflation will be underestimated inas -
much as this aversion is not fully considered in 
the trade- off, which may result in a tendency to 
set a low inflation target, all other things being 
equal.
Conclusion
The issue of setting a higher inflation target as 
a lesson learned from post- financial crisis devel -
opments, in particular the stubborn persistence 
of policy rates at the effective lower bound, 
has sparked international debate on whether 
the monetary policy consensus from before the 
financial crisis is still appropriate. This debate 
has often brought forth calls to raise the infla -
tion target as a lesson from the crisis.
Monetary policy inflation targets are essentially 
the outcome of a complex trade- off. Though 
they are not laws of nature, they do constitute 
key elements of monetary policy strategy which 
are ultimately crucial for the credibility of mon -
etary policy. Viewed from this angle, there 
would need to be a very strong rationale for changing the inflation target. This article illus -
trates that proponents of a higher inflation tar -
get commonly neglect to consider that this di -
minishes the effectiveness of monetary policy 
(because it flattens the Phillips curve) and that, 
in addition, more attention ought to be paid to 
the question of monetary policy credibility and 
the risk of inflation expectations becoming un -
anchored. Both of these points tend to suggest 
that a higher target rate of inflation will come 
with additional costs.
As a final point, considering that there are still 
further trade- offs that cannot be adequately 
factored into this model framework – such as 
public inflation aversion and unconventional 
monetary policy instruments at the effective 
lower bound – which suggest it would not be 
wise to set higher inflation targets, the argu -
ments put forward for raising medium- term 
rates of price increase as a monetary policy ob -
jective are incomplete and unconvincing.It therefore 
seems prema -
ture to question 
the inflation 
target  in 
principle
