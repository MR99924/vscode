5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeGrowth in overall output came to a halt in
the fourth quarter of 2002. According to thecalculations of the Federal Statistical Office,real gross domestic product (GDP) – afteradjustment for seasonal and working-dayvariations – did not quite match its level ofthe preceding quarter, which had still shownan increase of around
14%. Nevertheless, the
year-on-year figure was +0.5% in unadjustedterms and +0.7% in working-day terms.Average growth in 2002 was 0.2%.
The main retarding influences came from the
external sector. Exports were up again slightlydespite the fact that the particular pattern ofpublic holidays and “bridge days” (daystaken off to make up a long weekend) in Oc-tober and December led to hold-ups in indus-trial output. However, the rise in imports wassignificantly sharper, leading to a noticeablefall in net exports. Private consumption re-mained subdued, due in part – according torelevant surveys – to the announced increasesin taxes and social security contributions. Bycontrast, investment in machinery and equip-ment, in particular, showed a positive devel-opment. There was also a slight increase inconstruction investment. It would be prema-ture, however, to take this as an indication ofa reversal in trend.

6quarter of 2002 as a result of public holidays
and “bridge days”, improved again some-what at the beginning of 2003. Data onorders received in January are not yet avail-able owing to the base year being changedto 2000. However, seasonally adjusted outputrose again significantly in the first month of2003. Not only was it up on December, it wasalso higher than the average of the fourthquarter overall. There was a working-day-adjusted increase on the year of around
34%,
following a decline right up to the end of lastsummer.
ConstructionDemand for construction work stabilised at a
low level during the last few months of 2002(more recent statistics are unavailable atpresent). This also applies to December, when
the volume of incoming orders matched thatof the previous month in seasonally adjustedterms. In the fourth quarter as a whole, thevolume of orders was just as high as in thepreceding summer months. Although De-cember showed a slight rise on the year forthe first time in quite a long while, there wasstill a marked year-on-year fall of 5
14%o n
an average of the period from October toDecember.
Towards the end of the period under review,
positive stimuli were mainly generated by thedemand for residential construction. Therewas a surge in orders in November and – to aslightly lesser extent – in December. To a con-siderable degree, this is likely to have beenconnected with the announced cutback in as-sistance for housing construction, whichmany prospective house-owners aimed topre-empt by placing an order quickly. By con-trast, the volume of industrial and publicsector construction orders was tending toshow a further decline during the last fewmonths of 2002.
There was a marked seasonally adjusted fall
in construction output in January. The figurewas around one tenth down on the year. Thepersistently cold weather was no doubt thekey factor in this, with some parts of Ger-many also seeing heavy snowfalls. Underthese conditions, it was possible to performonly a limited amount of outdoor work.Overall growth

7Labour market
The labour market situation deteriorated fur-
ther around the turn of the year. The availableemployment statistics up to December showa renewed seasonally adjusted fall. In Decem-ber, the number of persons in work fell to38.48 million. This was about 100,000 fewerthan three months earlier and roughly395,000, or 1%, fewer than one year before.The greatest number of job losses continuedto be in construction and industry, but theservices sector was also showing only a smallincrease.
As in the preceding month, there was a dra-
matic increase in unemployment in February.The seasonally adjusted number of personsregistered as unemployed with the FederalLabour Office amounted to 4.36 million atthe end of the period under review. This wasaround 135,000 more than in December 2002and around 410,000 more than 12 monthsearlier. Apart from weak economic activity,the cold winter weather was a particular ad-verse factor affecting developments. Un-employment in outdoor occupations rosemuch more sharply than during the sameperiod in recent years. The seasonally adjust-ed unemployment rate, as calculated by theFederal Labour Office, reached 10.5%. Usingthe standardised method, the relevant figurewas 8.7%.

Oil prices

Monthly Report
March 2003
8Sea Oil on the international spot markets
went up to US$3312at times. The appreci-
ation of the euro on the foreign exchangemarkets curbed the upsurge somewhat froma European perspective. At 330
12per barrel,
however, the price of oil also reached newpeak figures here.
In January, this led to a renewed sharp sea-
sonally adjusted increase in import prices (cal-culated in euro). The year-on-year rate of in-crease remained at 0.5%. The situation wasmuch the same with regard to domestic in-dustrial prices, with the year-on-year increaserising to 1.6%.
The year-on-year rate of consumer price in-
crease went up from 1.1% in January to1.3% in February. There was a fairly sharp in-crease in seasonally adjusted terms too. To agreat extent, this was also due to oil prices.Furthermore, the prices of industrial goodscontinued to rise after special offers had beendiscontinued. By contrast, price movementsin food and services were largely consistentwith the seasonal pattern.
Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
In 2002 the indebtedness of central, state
and local government (as defined in thefinancial statistics) increased by 353 billion.
The debt level at the end of the year amount-ed to 31,277 billion. The consolidated indebt-
edness of general government (including thesocial security funds) as defined in the Maas-
tricht Treaty reached 31,283 billion – or
60.8% of GDP . Thus the ceiling of 60% set asthe debt criterion by the Maastricht Treatywas exceeded again after indebtedness haddipped below that level in 2001 for the firsttime since 1996. The structure of generalgovernment debt last year shifted furtheraway from direct borrowing and towardsmarketable debt securities. At the end of theyear, money and capital market securities hada 66% share in overall debt (as defined in theMaastricht Treaty); this was around 2
12per-
centage points higher than in 2001. Therelative volume of short-term debt (loans andsecurities) increased by
34percentage point to
just under 5%. The debt level set by theMaastricht Treaty also includes the volume ofcoins in circulation used as means of paymentwhich – contrary to banknotes – are a liabilityof the Federal Government. Since theamount of German euro coins outstanding isconsiderably smaller than the outstandingamount of D-Mark coins in the past, therewas a corresponding dampening effect onthe debt level at the end of 2002 comparedwith 2001. If this effect is disregarded, thedebt ratio would have been 0.2 percentagepoint higher.
The indebtedness of central, state and local
government rose very steeply in January(+322.3 billion). This was largely attributable
to net borrowing by the Federal Government,which raised 318.0 billion. Of that amount,
just under two-thirds (or 311.5 billion) was
accounted for by the increase in money mar-ket loans. Buoyant issuing activity was record-ed in the capital market. A ten-year FederalImport and

9bond (Bund) issue – which raised 36.7 billion –
was followed by a new thirty-year issue(which will mature in 2034), which yielded35.1 billion. Net proceeds from Bunds
amounted to 34.1 million. The Decem-
ber 2002 issue of Federal Treasury notes(Schätze) was topped up by 35 billion (includ-
ing market management operations) Theoutstanding amount of this paper rose by35.5 billion in total. The outstanding liabilities
arising from Federal savings notes declined by32.5 billion in the wake of the continuing
very weak demand and sizeable redemptions.The Federal Government repaid bank loans tothe net value of 30.9 billion.
Net borrowing of state government in Janu-
ary was significantly higher ( 33.8 billion) than
the level in January 2002 (0.2 billion). In add-ition to the combined state government bondissue No 14 ( 31.7 billion) – in which eight
federal states participated – individual stateissues were launched in the capital marketabove all by Bavaria ( 30.8 billion), Baden-
Württemberg ( 31.0 billion) and Berlin ( 31.2
billion). The Land governments raised 34.2
billion net through the issue of Treasurynotes, whereas loans from banks (includingcash advances) were redeemed to the valueof30.4 billion. Of the special funds, the in-
debtedness of the “German Unity” Fundwent up slightly by 30.1 billion. Local govern-
ment appears to have marginally raised its in-debtedness in January.Federal Government borrowing
In February the Federal Government in-
creased its indebtedness by 32.5 billion. It
drew exclusively on the capital market, whilelowering its liabilities on the money marketby31.2 billion. Gross borrowing in the capital
market was marked by a follow-up auction offive-year Federal notes (Bobls) series 141,which has a 4.25% coupon. A volume of36.3 billion was allotted in the auction at an
average yield of 3.25%. After taking dueaccount of redemptions and ongoing sales,31.3 billion net accrued to the Federal
Government. In addition, it procured liquidityby running down its market managementstocks of Bunds ( 32.1 billion) and Schätze
(30.8 billion). The monthly issue of Treasury

Securities markets
Bond marketAfter the downturn at the end of 2002, bor-
rowing in the German bond market made adistinct recovery in January 2003. Domesticborrowers issued debt securities to a marketvalue of 3118.6 billion, compared with 370.1
billion in December 2002. After deducting re-demptions and adjusting for changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds, net salesof322.6 billion were achieved, comparedwith net redemptions of 342.1 billion in the
previous month. Sales of foreign debt secur-ities in Germany yielded 33.5 billion. Demand
for euro-denominated paper was particularlyheavy ( 36.1 billion) and 32.6 billion net worth
of bonds denominated in foreign currencywere redeemed. Overall, net sales of domes-tic and foreign bonds yielded 326.1 billion in
January, compared with net redemptions of346.5 billion one month previously.
The public sector increased its indebtedness
in the bond market by 314.3 billion in Janu-
ary, as opposed to a decrease of 315.7 billion
in the previous month. The Federal Govern-ment raised 317.5 billion net (December
2002: - 38.6 billion) from sales of its own
bonds, with ten-year Federal bonds account-ing for just under half of this amount ( 38.0
billion).
1There was also a marked increase in
the volume outstanding of two-year Treasurynotes ( 35.8 billion) and thirty-year Federal
bonds ( 35.4 billion). The Land governments
issued 34.8 billion net worth of bonds and
notes in January, after their bonded debt hadhardly changed in the previous month. Abond issued by the Treuhand agency was re-deemed for 38.0 billion.
Sales of corporate bonds increased distinctly,
reaching a new record level of 37.3 billion in
January. Most of these sales were of commer-cial paper ( 35.1 billion) issued by domestic in-
dustrial enterprises.Net borrowing in the market by the

11In January the credit institutions mainly refi-
nanced bonds which had matured and raisedonly 31.0 billion of new funds in the bond
market, after making net redemptions of323.5 billion in December 2002. The only in-
crease was in debt securities issued by spe-cialised credit institutions ( 36.7 billion) and
other bank bonds ( 31.2 billion). Public Pfand-
briefe were, by contrast, redeemed for 36.9
billion.
The main purchasers in the bond market in
January were domestic non-banks, whichadded 313.9 billion worth of bonds to their
portfolios. Most of these bonds ( 311.5 billion)
were issued by domestic private sector bor-rowers, followed by foreign bonds and notes(31.4 billion) and public sector bonds ( 30.9
billion). By contrast, the credit institutionspurchased primarily public sector paper ( 39.2
billion) and sold 34.4 billion worth of bonds
issued by domestic private sector borrowers.Overall, they purchased 36.8 billion worth
of fixed interest securities in January. Non-residents invested 35.4 billion on the German
bond market.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
remained weak in January. Domestic enter-prises placed new shares to a market value of30.7 billion, roughly the same volume as in
the previous month. At the same time, thevolume of foreign equities held in Germanydecreased by 31.9 billion, after having in-
creased by 35.5 billion in the previous month.The sole purchasers in the equity market
in January were domestic non-banks, whichadded 30.7 billion worth of shares to their
share portfolios. Non-resident investors re-duced their holdings of shares by 31.2 billion
and domestic credit institutions by 30.7 bil-
lion.
Mutual fund sharesThe resources raised by domestic mutual
funds in January were, at 312.9 billion, some-
what down on the comparatively high levelof the previous month ( 315.5 billion). Just
under two-thirds of these resources ( 38.1 bil-
lion) accrued to specialised funds, which areof particular interest to institutional investors.After stagnating at the end of 2002, fundsopen to the general public expanded distinct-Sales and purchases

12ly; they sold 34.8 billion worth of shares.
Open-end real estate funds ( 33.4 billion) and
money market funds ( 31.9 billion), which
seem best able to meet investors’ need for se-curity, had the greatest appeal for investors.In an environment of weak stock marketprices, share-based funds redeemed 30.6 bil-
lion worth of shares. Sales of foreign fundshares yielded 33.0 billion in Germany in
January, after a decline in the previousmonth. The total amount raised from sales ofdomestic and foreign mutual fund sharesthus came to 315.9 billion, just slightly up on
the previous month ( 314.7 billion).
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a deficit of
31.3 billion in Januar 2003. In the previous
month there had been a surplus of 36.3 bil-
lion. This reversal was due to the sharp in-crease in the deficit on invisible current trans-actions with non-residents, which is that partof the current account comprising services,factor income and current transfers. By con-trast, the trade surplus improved slightly.
According to figures from the Federal Statis-
tical Office, the surplus on foreign tradeamounted to 39.0 billion in January com-
pared with one of 38.3 billion in December.
After the elimination of seasonal influences,however, the trade surplus remained almostat its December level of 310
12billion. This
was the result of an almost equally strong risein both the imports and exports of goods. Ex-ports recorded a seasonally adjusted increaseof 3% in January compared with Decemberwhile imports rose by 4%. If November, De-
cember and January are taken together, how-ever, exports showed a slight decline (of justover
12%) compared with the previous three-
month period; they had been particularlystrong in August and September. Imports ofgoods increased only slightly, at just over
12%, in a three-month comparison.
The deficit on the remaining current transac-
tions with non-residents increased month onmonth in January by 38.4 billion to 39.5 bil-
lion. This was due primarily to the seasonaldeterioration in the services account and infactor income: services ran a deficit of 33.8
billion in January whereas there had been asurplus of 30.4 billion in December; the def-
icit on factor income amounted to 35.0 bil-
lion compared with a surplus of 30.1 billion in
the previous month. However, net expend-iture in the field of current transfers declinedby31.0 billion to 30.8 billion.
In the field of financial transactions with non-
residents a small (net) amount of capital wasimported as a result of portfolio investment inJanuary whereas direct investment and credittransactions led to net capital exports. Thenet imports of funds arising from cross-bordersecurities transactions amounted to 30.8 bil-
lion in January (compared with net outflowsof310.2 billion in December). The main rea-
son for this development was the move onthe part of foreign investors from selling tobuying German paper ( 33.5 billion compared
with - 310.4 billion in December). Their inter-
est was directed exclusively at interest-bearing instruments (bonds and notes: 34.2
billion; money market paper: 31.2 billion)Current

13whereas they reduced their net holdings of
equities ( 31.2 billion) and investment fund
certificates ( 30.7 billion). However, German
savers also increased their investment in for-eign securities markets again ( 32.7 billion),
the bulk of their portfolio investment beingonce more in euro-denominated bonds ( 36.1
billion). At the same time, they acquired moreshares in investment funds ( 30.7 billion) and
in money market funds ( 32.3 billion) whereas
they sold net amounts of shares ( 33.8 billion),
foreign currency bonds ( 32.0 billion) and
money market paper ( 30.6 billion).
Substantial net outflows of capital occurred
in the field of direct investment in January(315.1 billion) as German proprietors pro-
vided their branches domiciled abroad withinvestable funds amounting to 316.6 billion,
almost exclusively in the form of credits(313.7 billion). By contrast, the subsidiaries of
foreign enterprises domiciled in Germany re-corded a small inflow of funds ( 31.5 billion).
Outflows of funds also predominated in the
non-securitised credit transactions of thenon-banks ( 39.9 billion net). At the beginning
of the year fairly large amounts of funds(39.3 billion) were invested abroad, mainly by
enterprises and individuals, whereas at theend of 2002 they had significantly reducedtheir foreign bank balances. The operationsof public authorities likewise resulted in netoutflows of capital ( 30.6 billion). By contrast,
there were net inflows of 39.4 billion in the
German banking sector, whose accounts re-flect, as it were, the remaining recorded ex-ternal payments. This amount includes theexternal liabilities of the Bundesbank whichMajor items of the balance

15The Eurosystem’s
monetary policyframework –experience to dateand measuresto improve itsefficiencyThe Eurosystem’s monetary policy in-
struments have served well in theirfirst four years. They have enabled theEurosystem to achieve its operationalgoal, the effective steering of short-term money market rates, and to sig-nal its monetary policy objectives in asufficiently precise and differentiatedmanner. The Eurosystem nonethelesscarried out a thorough efficiency an-alysis of its monetary policy instru-ments during 2002 and presented sug-gestions for operational and technicalimprovements for discussion in a publicconsultation procedure. The principalaim was to avoid speculative underbid-ding in the main refinancing oper-ations and to achieve some consolida-tion of the range of monetary policyinstruments. To be more specific, theproposals included changing the tim-ing of the reserve maintenance period,shortening the maturity of the mainrefinancing operations to one weekand suspending the longer-term refi-nancing operations. Taking account ofthe numerous comments and sugges-tions made by the Eurosystem’s monet-ary policy counterparties and by finan-cial sector associations, the GoverningCouncil of the ECB decided in January2003 to implement the first two meas-ures in the first quarter of 2004 but notto suspend the longer-term refinan-cing operations.

16Functions of the monetary policy
instruments
The Eurosystem has a number of instruments
which it can use to implement its monetarypolicy. This can be explained not least bythe fact that in order to maintain continuitywhen the transition was made to the thirdstage of European economic and monetaryunion, it was decided to include instrumentsthat had proved their worth in various partici-pating member states in the set of monetarypolicy instruments. Nonetheless, certain in-struments predominate. They are closelyinterrelated in operational terms and, toan extent, interdependent. In the public con-sultation procedure, the form of the min-imum reserve system, the regular open mar-ket operations and the standing facilitieswere accordingly presented as a single discus-sion package.
All euro-area credit institutions have to com-
ply with minimum reserve requirements, theaim being to create, or enlarge, a structuralliquidity shortage at the banks vis-à-vis theEurosystem. This ensures that the credit insti-tutions are sufficiently dependent on refinan-cing through the Eurosystem and that theirdemand for central bank money is stabilised.This in turn lays the foundation for efficientmoney market management by means ofregular, liquidity-providing open market oper-ations. The credit institutions have to complywith their minimum reserve requirementsonly as an average of a reserve maintenanceperiod lasting several weeks, the aim beingfor the institutions to attenuate the daily fluc-tuations in money market liquidity by varyingtheir compliance profile. Average compliance
thus curbs the volatility of the overnight rate,thereby stabilising money market interestrates. The institutions’ holdings of requiredreserves are remunerated at the average mar-ginal rate of allotment in the main refinan-cing operations over the reserve maintenanceperiod concerned, with the result that theminimum reserve requirement represents vir-tually no cost factor for the credit institutions.Excess reserves, however, are not remuner-ated and shortfalls are subject to sanctions.
The possible range of fluctuations of the
overnight rate in the interbank market is re-stricted by the interest rates on the twostanding facilities. The deposit facility can beused to absorb excess liquidity and the mar-ginal lending facility can provide additionalovernight liquidity – but only up to the levelof the required collateral.
While the Governing Council of the ECB sig-
nals the general stance of monetary policy bythe rates on the standing facilities, it uses theregular open market operations (main andlonger-term refinancing operations) to steerthe current interest rate and to manage theliquidity situation in the money market, inparticular the evolution of the overnight rate.In addition to the minimum reserves, creditinstitutions’ refinancing needs are geared tothe market factors determining liquidity (suchas the volume of banknotes in circulation, theEurosystem’s net foreign reserves and govern-ment deposits at the national central banks).Apart from the regular refinancing oper-ations, the Eurosystem can draw on a rangeof further open market operations as and

17when required in order to affect liquidity or
interest rates primarily on a short-term basis.
The main refinancing operations are the key
element in the Eurosystem’s operational mon-etary policy approach. By changing the min-imum bid rate (variable rate tenders) or thefixed interest rate (fixed rate tenders), theGoverning Council of the ECB signals itsmonetary policy stance and steers the termsat the short end of the money market, thestarting point in the monetary policy trans-mission process. The main refinancing oper-ations cover most of the refinancing needs.They are offered on a weekly basis with atwo-week maturity, meaning that at anygiven time, two overlapping main tenderoperations are outstanding. The main re-financing operations are carried out by thenational central banks in the Eurosystem in adecentralised auction procedure in accord-ance with standard criteria. The allotment de-cision for the Eurosystem as a whole is takenby the Executive Board of the ECB in line withthe monetary policy stance decided by theGoverning Council of the ECB.
The longer-term refinancing operations are
conducted once a month as variable rate ten-ders with no minimum bid rate and a matur-ity of around three months. These basictenders are not used to give monetary policysignals. The market is therefore informed inadvance of the volume of the allotment andthe Eurosystem operates merely as a “ratetaker”. This type of operation is intended toprovide, in particular, smaller credit institu-tions which are less active in the money mar-ket with longer-term basic refinancing direct-ly from the central bank, reflecting one as-
pect of the Bundesbank’s former, traditionalrediscount credit. The allotment volume forthe longer-term refinancing operations isgenerally determined for one year in advancein line with liquidity needs in such a way as toleave the Eurosystem sufficient room formanoeuvre in the main refinancing oper-ations.
Efficiency of the monetary policy
instruments
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy framework
has been shown to function well. First, theEurosystem has sent the intended monetarypolicy signals promptly to the markets;second, the volatility of the overnight ratehas been contained despite the low fre-quency of interventions in the money market;and third, as a rule the liquidity needs havebeen met and money market developmentsstabilised by the weekly main refinancing op-erations, with ultimately little use being madeof the standing facilities and only very rareuse of fine-tuning operations. Finally, cross-border liquidity transfers among the bankshave also helped to keep money market inter-est rates at the European financial centres vir-tually identical, with the result that it was notinaccurate to speak of a well-integrated Euro-pean money market.
Nonetheless, it became clear that the instru-
ments did not function completely smoothlyunder all conditions and thus left scope forenhancing efficiency. For example, the timingof the reserve maintenance period – from the

1824th day of a month to the 23rd of the fol-
lowing month – sometimes proved problem-atic. The Italian tax payment date, which isaccompanied by wide fluctuations of govern-ment balances at the Banca d’Italia that aredifficult to forecast, systematically coincidedwith the last day of the reserve maintenanceperiod. This meant that even after the finaltender allotment of the period, fairly largerisks for liquidity and interest rate develop-ments persisted right up to the end of the re-serve maintenance period. This problem be-came somewhat less acute from July 2002onwards because from that date most taxpayments to the Italian government’s cash ac-count at the Banca d’Italia have generallybeen made before the 23rd day of a month.Moreover, the credit institutions incur costs ifthe end of the reserve maintenance periodfalls on a weekend or on a TARGET holiday. In
order to play safe and especially to avoid pen-alties for reserve shortfalls, credit institutionsare inclined to hold higher credit balances atthe national central banks on the last busi-ness day of a reserve maintenance periodthan are absolutely necessary. This results inlarger, generally unremunerated excess re-serves than when the end of the maintenanceperiod falls on a business day. However, re-serve management can also become expen-sive for the banks if the reserve maintenanceperiod starts on a non-business day. In thatcase recourse to the standing facilities whichis concentrated at the end of the mainten-ance period is carried forward into the newmaintenance period. If the marginal lendingfacility is used, financing in the new period isrelatively expensive. Resources which havebeen placed in the deposit facility at the endof the reserve maintenance period and thuswithdrawn from reserve maintenance, gener-ally have to be raised again in the new period– at greater cost – at the central bank or inthe money market.
From 1999 to 2002, on average just under
three-quarters of the banking industry’sliquidity needs were met by main refinancingoperations (around 3149 billion), while the
longer-term refinancing operations, amount-ing to an average of around 354 billion,
covered just over one-quarter of the liquiditydeficit. The volume of main tenders was thus– as intended – invariably sufficiently large topromptly offset even sizeable changes in thebanks’ liquidity needs.

19union from an annual average of 777 credit
institutions in 1999 to an annual average of307 in 2002. This development is to be seen,first, in connection with the general patternof consolidation in the banking industry andthe concomitant centralisation of liquiditymanagement; second, participation in themain refinancing operations turned out to bedependent on the tender procedure and onthe interest rate expectations prevailing in themarket. For example, from mid-2000 whenthe changeover was made from fixed rate tovariable rate tenders, there has been a spe-cially marked decline in tender participation,as smaller, risk-averse credit institutions, inparticular, have been pulling out of the tenderoperations (see chart on page 20). The de-cline in bidder interest should be seen as re-lated to the complexities of the variable ratetender, which make it difficult for the creditinstitutions to make an appropriate market-oriented bid decision. Expectations of a re-duction in interest rates, which became morefrequent from spring 2001 onwards, mayalso have led to somewhat lower bidder inter-est. Nonetheless, a large degree of competi-tion was still evident in the tender operationsand there were no signs of oligopolistic struc-tures.
From the point of view of the Eurosystem and
the market players, the most important modi-fication to date in the use of the monetarypolicy instruments was the changeover fromfixed rate tenders to variable rate tenderswith a minimum bid rate starting with themain refinancing operations in June 2000.The advantage of fixed rate tenders for mon-etary policy was that they enable an extreme-ly clear signal of the monetary policy stance
to be given. It also meant, however, that thecounterparties could offer large amountswith relatively little risk, as the ECB has invari-ably geared the allotment amount to theliquidity need in order to stabilise moneymarket rates. In the spring of 2000 marketparticipants’ expectations of an interest rateincrease had become broadly entrenched, re-sulting in vast overbidding in the main re-

20financing operations, which were still being
offered as fixed rate tenders. The allotmentratio finally fell to below 1%. The changeoverto variable rate tenders effectively eliminatedthe appeal of speculative overbidding. Fromthe purely technical perspective of liquiditymanagement, speculative overbidding waslargely unproblematic; however, it does makehigher demands of the banking system inmanaging its portfolios of eligible assets,which are required to collateralise centralbank credit, and in redistributing central bankliquidity in the interbank market after the ten-der allotment. In the event of very high over-bidding, it is almost impossible for the individ-ual institutions to estimate the volume likelyto be allotted to it as even small, unexpectedchanges in the allotment ratio lead to largechanges in the allotment to individual banks.Following the transition to variable rate ten-
ders with a minimum bid rate, the first occur-rence of the phenomenon of “underbidding”took place in February 2001, in an environ-ment of high expectations of a cut in interestrates. In anticipation of an interest rate cutwithin the ongoing reserve maintenanceperiod, bidding by the credit institutions inthe main refinancing operation was so re-strained that the total bid volume was insuffi-cient to allow the amount which would havebeen appropriate from a liquidity policy per-spective to be allotted. In the event of specu-lative underbidding, the Eurosystem has sofar decided to tolerate the temporary rise inthe volatility of money market rates (causedby a short-term liquidity shortage in the mar-ket) and to cover at least part of the remain-ing liquidity need only in the forthcomingmain tender(s) in the current reserve mainten-ance period. This signalled to the counterpar-ties that they also have to bear the cost riskof speculative behaviour. Although the rise involatility was restricted to the short end ofthe money market, this can also impair thesignals about the current monetary policystance. Against this background, the Govern-ing Council of the ECB decided in November2001 to take decisions relating to the monet-ary policy stance only at its first meeting ofthe month. Opportunities for speculativeunderbidding, with ensuing distortions onthe market for overnight money, were thusreduced considerably. All in all, the Eurosys-tem also gave an effective monetary policysignal by means of the variable rate tenderwith a minimum bid rate, but the marginal aswell as the weighted allotment rate weregenerally close to the Eurosystem’s bench-

21mark. Larger deviations were limited to
periods in which there were clear expect-ations of a change in the interest rate.
One of the side-effects of underbidding is a
divergence in the volumes of the two out-standing main refinancing operations, which,from a technical and operational perspective,can lead to difficulties. Since April 2002 theseven-day operations (tender split operations)carried out singly at the same time as thetwo-week tender for the purpose of eveningout the tender volumes are considered, alsowith regard to their form, to be main refinan-cing operations and are thus included in thecalculation of the remuneration of minimumreserves.Since the start of monetary union bidder par-
ticipation in the longer-term refinancing op-erations has also declined, albeit less marked-ly than in the main tenders (see chart onpage 20). Whereas an average of somewhatmore than 300 credit institutions took part inthe basic tenders in 1999, average participa-tion in 2002 was only 186 institutions. How-ever, the ratio of bid volume to allotment vol-ume per auction has not changed significant-ly since mid-2000 (similar to the correspond-ing ratio for the main tender). It averages outat just under 2 (slightly less for the main ten-der). The group of banks which participateregularly in the longer-term tenders is ex-tremely heterogeneous and participation bysmaller credit institutions, ie the target group,has not yet been seen to be particularly sig-nificant.

22German credit institutions have been among
the most active bidders in the longer-term re-financing operations; this is also reflected par-ticularly in their persistently large allotmentshare.
With regard to the interest rates offered, a
comparison of the marginal allotment rate inthe longer-term refinancing operations andthe three-month Eonia swap rate shows thatbasic refinancing is a relatively expensive wayfor the credit institutions to ensure that theyhave sufficient liquidity. While the averagespread between the marginal allotmentrate in the main tender and the two-weekEonia swap rate between April 2001 andFebruary 2003 was relatively stable aroundzero, the corresponding spread for thelonger-term refinancing operations averaged2
12basis points. Furthermore, a slight broad-
ening of the spread on three-month matur-ities has been observed since the second halfof 2002, although at least part of this can beattributed to typical seasonal bidding behav-iour relating to the credit institutions’ end-of-year liquidity arrangements. All in all, theseobservations could be taken as an indicationthat credit institutions have recently been ac-cording greater importance to the provisionof longer-term liquidity. Given the limitedmoney market liquidity for longer-termfunds, this assessment seems reasonable. Thelonger-term refinancing operations also hadadvantages in connection with the provisionof liquidity for the millennium changeover;the tender volume was temporarily increasedand a larger amount of basic liquidity supplywas thus available during the millenniumchangeover period. This had a stabilising ef-fect on bank balances and prevented a fearedliquidity shortage.
Public consultation procedure
Triggered by the aforementioned under-
bidding problem in the main refinancing op-erations, the Eurosystem’s monetary policyframework was thoroughly reviewed lastyear. As a result, the Governing Council ofthe ECB formulated measures which seemedappropriate to remove the inefficiencies de-tected, and in autumn 2002 asked the creditinstitutions, banking associations and finan-cial market groups in the euro area to indicatetheir views on the proposed operational andtechnical changes in a public consultation

23procedure. The following specific changes
were put forward for discussion.
– The reserve maintenance period should be
timed to coincide with the monthly mon-etary policy meeting of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB and would thus beginon the settlement day of the main refinan-cing operation immediately following thefirst Governing Council meeting of themonth. The adjustment of the interestrates on the standing facilities would like-wise coincide with the start of a reservemaintenance period.
– In order to avoid the main refinancing op-
erations hanging over into the subsequentreserve maintenance period, the maturityof the main refinancing operations shouldbe shortened to one week.
– Suspension of the longer-term refinancing
operations was also proposed because ithad become apparent that the originaltarget group (smaller institutions whichwere not active on the money market)had not been reached.
Changing the timing of the reserve mainten-
ance period would mean that the mainten-ance period would always begin on a TARGETbusiness day and that recourse to the stand-ing facilities at the end of the maintenanceperiod would no longer hang over into thenew maintenance period. Furthermore, themaintenance period would generally end ona TARGET business day, making it easier tocarry out the final fine-tuning of the reservemaintenance. As a rule, the central bank ratewould not be changed during a reserve main-
tenance period, thus reducing the probabilityof speculative over or underbidding. Simul-taneously reducing the maturity of the maintenders to one week would mean that inter-est rate expectations would be unlikely tocontinue to affect the bidding behaviour ofthe counterparties within a reserve mainten-ance period.
All market players welcomed the public con-
sultation procedure, which was seen as mak-ing a positive contribution to transparency.The numerous responses received by the ECBand the national central banks conveyed adetailed and varied picture of the credit insti-tutions’ and banking associations’ views andpreferences. It also became clear that, despitethe room for improvement of the monetarypolicy instruments noted by the GoverningCouncil of the ECB, the financial sector didnot think that the monetary policy transmis-sion and the functioning of the money mar-ket had been seriously impeded by occasionalover and underbidding.
The vast majority of the euro-area institutions
consulted were in favour of changing the tim-ing of the reserve maintenance period. TheGerman institutions and banking associationswhich took part in the consultation procedurealso signalled their agreement with the sug-gestion to make the reserve maintenanceperiod more flexible. However, views differedabout the benefits of avoiding underbidding.Larger institutions which are active in themoney market generally viewed speculativeunderbidding and the concomitant volatilityon the overnight money market in a positive

24light as this ultimately also opens up oppor-
tunities to make gains. Otherwise, underbid-ding, as opposed to using money market de-rivative instruments, was felt to be a less effi-cient and professional means of speculatingon the interest rate decisions of the Govern-ing Council of the ECB. The main advantagefor smaller institutions was the reduced vola-tility on the overnight money market, as thisenhances their liquidity management. Theoverall positive response to the proposal, in-cluding from German institutions, seems tohave had more to do with expected cost re-ductions arising from the fact that the reservemaintenance period will no longer start orend on a weekend or on TARGET holidays. Byfar the majority of the respondent credit insti-tutions did not expect any major technicalproblems to be caused by changing over toreserve maintenance periods of varying
length, although it was suggested that theEurosystem publish a “reserve maintenancecalendar” (similar to the tender calendar) ingood time.
The long time span between an interest rate
decision and its taking effect was seen as crit-ical. The six-day time span between the meet-ing of the Governing Council of the ECB onthe Thursday and the start of the new reservemaintenance period on the following Wed-nesday was considered exceptionally long, es-pecially as changes to the interest rates onthe standing facilities only take effect on thevalue date of the main refinancing operationimmediately following the monetary policymeeting of the Governing Council.

25management, it was noticed that the last
main tender in the reserve maintenanceperiod is always settled six days before theend of the period. As the quality of the liquid-ity forecasts tends to decline the longer theforecasting horizon, the view was that therewould be greater risk of sub-optimal allot-ments in the main tender and of money mar-ket rates being systematically more volatile atthe end of the reserve maintenance period.
The proposed shortening of the maturity of
the main refinancing operations to one weekas a complementary measure to the changein the reserve maintenance period wasapproved by the euro-area banks with somereservations. Most of the institutions saw theshortening of the main tender maturity as alogical complement to the changed timingof the reserve maintenance period, helpingto prevent speculative underbidding in thefuture. The concerns expressed by the creditinstitutions had mainly to do with the add-itional operational risks associated with themove away from overlapping main refinan-cing operations and the effect of greater un-certainty on liquidity management. If theEurosystem or individual bidders were to runinto major technical difficulties during thetender procedures, a far greater proportion ofthe total refinancing volume would be affect-ed than in the case of two overlapping oper-ations. Moreover, concern was expressed thatif only one main refinancing operation wereoutstanding, the institutions might be in-clined to make price-boosting safety bids inorder to avoid being given an underallotmentor a zero allotment. This could lead to a“structural” increase in the marginal andweighted allotment rates and make refinan-
cing more expensive overall. In changing overto a single one-week main refinancing oper-ation, it should also be borne in mind that aninstitution which is given a zero allotment –owing to the resultant higher volume tobe raised via the market – might find itmore pertinent to have recourse to themoney market. As a possible means of off-setting the shortening of the main tendermaturity, various market players suggestedintroducing a monthly “maintenance periodtender”, which would make basic liquidityavailable for the duration of the maintenanceperiod.
Besides the German institutions, which trad-
itionally take an active part in basic refinancing,virtually all other credit institutions which par-ticipated in the consultation procedure wereagainst the suspension of the longer-term re-financing operations. Basic refinancing wassaid to play an important role for the institu-tions in balancing the maturity structure oftheir refinancing. In addition, the importanceof basic tenders as part of forward-lookingliquidity planning was stressed, this havingbeen promoted in the BIS recommendations“Sound practices for managing liquidity inbanking organisations”.
Most credit institutions did not consider un-
secured longer-term money market oper-ations, or the interbank repo market, to beentirely viable substitutes for longer-termcentral bank refinancing. The view is thatlonger-term, unsecured money market lend-ing has never had the necessary depth ofliquidity. The eligible assets for a general col-

26lateral repo operation1differ from those
which can be used for central bank refinan-cing; longer maturities are also not veryliquid. Basic tenders thus offer banks the op-portunity to build up a broader refinancingbasis which is diversified in terms of maturity;they therefore represent an important, stabil-ising element in their liquidity management.
As a counterweight to the planned shortening
of the maturity of the main refinancing oper-ations, the credit institutions frequently askedfor the volume of basic refinancing to be in-creased. The view was that this could countera reduction in the average refinancing maturity.In particular, an increase in the volume oflonger-term refinancing operations could miti-gate the higher operational and liquidity man-agement risks associated with the plannedconsecutive one-week main tenders.
Decision of the Governing Council
of the ECB
At its meeting on 23 January 2003 the Gov-
erning Council of the ECB decided to changethe timing of the reserve maintenance period,
as suggested, to coincide with the monthlymonetary policy meeting of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB. Changes to the interestrates on the standing facilities will also takeeffect at the start of the reserve maintenanceperiod and the maturity of the main refinan-cing operations will be shortened to oneweek. Given the strong support for retainingthe longer-term refinancing operations, itwas decided not to suspend them. The twoapproved changes will be implemented in thefirst quarter of 2004. This will ensure that theEurosystem and its counterparties will haveenough time to make the technical adjust-ments that have become necessary as a resultof changing the timing of the reserve main-tenance period and shortening the maturityof the main refinancing operations.

27Macroeconomic
aspects of shareprice developmentsAs investment and financing instru-
ments, shares played a rather minorrole in the German financial system formany years. During the course of the1990s, however, investors and com-panies in Germany, too, increasinglytook the more direct route via the se-curities markets. This development hasexperienced a major setback with thecollapse of stock market prices duringthe past few years. In the longer term,however, the importance of the equitymarket within the German financialsystem can be expected to continue toincrease, and with it the influence ofshare price movements on saving, in-vestment and consumption decisionsand, ultimately, on the general level ofprices. This article first provides a briefoverview of the significance of sharesas an investment and financing instru-ment and then examines the determin-ants of share prices and their implica-tions for macroeconomic develop-ments.
Shares as an investment and financing
instrument
In line with the boom of all the world’s major
equity markets in the second half of the1990s, the German stock market’s import-ance for the German economy increased sub-stantially. In spring 2000 the market value ofshares listed in Germany reached a level ofjust under 31.7 trillion, or 82% of GDP , com-
pared with 22% at the end of 1995. After

28peaking in March 2000, however, market
capitalisation fell sharply owing to the steepslide in share prices. At the end of 2002 themarket value of German listed public limitedcompanies (PLCs) had fallen to “only” 3647
billion, or 31% of GDP , and has continued todecrease since then. While this ratio is stillhigher than it was in the mid-1990s, priorto the onset of the exceptional stock marketboom, the significance of equity marketsremains much smaller in Germany than inother industrial countries such as the USA(105% of GDP) or the UK (108%) with along-established equity culture.
During the bear market in the last three
years, moreover, the number of domestic list-ed enterprises declined. The total at the endof January 2003 (1,003 PLCs) was neverthe-less greater than in the mid-1990s, when
fewer than 700 companies were listed. Thekey factor in this rise was the boom in initialpublic offerings (IPOs) on the Neuer Markt
segment of the German stock market; inother regulated market segments, however,the number of listed companies declined. Al-though the amount of capital raised via theequity market likewise receded distinctly fol-lowing the bull market in the second half ofthe 1990s, on a longer-term view the trendtowards equity financing seems to be con-tinuing.
However, it is too early to speak of a major
shift in macroeconomic financing patterns to-wards the equity market. The corporate land-scape in Germany has traditionally been dom-inated by non-corporations (sole proprietorsand small and medium-sized partnerships).As for German corporations, they are largelyrun as private limited companies ( Gesellschaft
mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH ) or limited
partnerships in which private limited com-panies are partners ( GmbH & Co. KG ), where-
as public limited companies still play a muchless significant role. The number of PLCsshowed a marked rise only during the boomin the late 1990s. This trend continued subse-quently, but on a greatly diminished scale. Atthe same time, the focus of share issuanceshifted from listed companies to non-listedcompanies, whose equity financing out-stripped capital funding via the stock ex-change in the last two years.
Public limited companies have thus apparent-
ly weathered the ups and downs of equityprice movements on the stock markets to be-International comparison of

this particular corporate legal status leavesopen the option of an IPO at a later date. Thisprospect has been made more attractive bychanges in the legal setting – notably as aresult of the Financial Market Promotion Actsand the tax reform adopted in 2001. Theseextra benefits also outweigh the additionalcosts associated with the organisational re-quirements contained in the German StockCorporation Act and the corresponding dis-closure rules. This development has beenreinforced by legislative efforts to make it eas-ier for enterprises to obtain access to the cap-ital market. The new insolvency legislation,which has weakened the previously strongposition of creditors and has thus tended tomake debt financing more expensive, mightalso prompt enterprises indirectly to seeequity financing in a new light. This will prob-ably be further bolstered by banks’ reassess-ment of credit risk, since the generally strong-er capital base of PLCs gives them a betterrisk standing. Taken together, these factorswill continue to strengthen the role of equityfinancing in the future.
For many years shares were unpopular
among investors in Germany as they wereconsidered a particularly risky form of invest-ment. Moreover, for their old-age provision,large segments of the population relied heav-ily on their claims under the pay-as-you-gostatutory pension system, which was supple-mented by company pension schemes andcapital accumulation in the form of privatelife assurance policies. An important role wasalso played by savings with banks and invest-ment in real property. Many people, however,Net capital raised: +

30saw no need to make additional private old-
age provision by investing in the equity mar-ket.
1A certain change in attitude has taken
place since the mid-1990s. The debate on theproblems involved in funding the statutorypension insurance scheme has caused thepublic to become more aware of the need forprivate old-age provision. In addition, thelong period of rising share prices, accompan-ied by falling nominal interest rates, helpeddirect attention to shares as an alternative in-vestment vehicle. The euphoric mood withwhich the markets celebrated the liberalisa-tion and privatisation of the telecommunica-tions sector and the dramatic upswing in theother “new growth industries”, however,also raised overblown expectations whichwere ultimately dashed, causing considerabledamage to the incipient equity market cul-ture.
As in the past, only a small minority (around
8%) of the German population directly holdshares in companies,
2although this figure
was even lower in the mid-1990s, at around6%. What has spread much faster, however,is indirect equity ownership through mutualfunds. Now nearly 9% of Germans haveshares in equity-based mutual funds. Thetotal value of shares held by households dir-ectly and indirectly made up around 14% oftheir financial assets at the end of 2001, com-pared to less than 10% in 1995.Share price swings between bull and
bear markets
The trends outlined in the previous section
indicate that, despite the serious setbacks inthe past few years, shares have undoubtedlyacquired greater long-term importance as aninvestment and financing instrument in Ger-many. Movements on equity markets interestmonetary policy makers above all becausethey can provide insights into market partici-pants’ changing attitudes regarding the situ-ation of, and outlook for, the economy. Atthe same time, these movements are closelylinked to the other segments of the financialmarkets. The risk of exaggerated share priceswings followed by downward correctionsconstitutes a particular danger – and not onlyfor investors and savers. In fact, these phe-nomena may also have repercussions on thefunctional ability of the financial system andhence potentially on the effectiveness ofmonetary policy as well.
In the past few years the financial market in-
frastructure has improved considerably, andthis has not gone unnoticed by investors. Thederegulation of international capital move-ments and innovations in information andcommunication technology (ICT) have madesecurities trading and settlement muchcheaper and faster.

31ocity with which it can be provided and pro-
cessed have increased enormously. Today,market participants have at their fingertips avast volume of up-to-date information fromall over the world to which they can react im-mediately by adjusting their portfolios. As aconsequence, markets have indeed becomemore sensitive to changes in information inthe past few years. The downside of this de-velopment is that it has encouraged investorsto focus more on the short term. Uncertaintyis much more likely now to lead to high shareprice volatility, which in turn may amplify un-certainty (at least in the short run) – includingoutside the financial markets.
These risks have been highlighted by various
structural weaknesses which have becomeapparent during the bear market which hasprevailed on major equity markets for thepast three years. They include, for instance,the poor quality of some market-relevant dataand information which even extends to glar-ing examples of fraudulent accounting prac-tices. In principle, all market participants havean interest in reliable data on the business de-velopments of listed enterprises in a systemof checks and balances policed by independ-ent auditors and financial analysts. However,this can function only if all participants, alsoin their own interest, maintain their integrityand respect the rules of the market. Duringthe stock market boom, which was accom-panied by high growth targets, checks andbalances took a back seat to short-term gain.Especially where the “new economy” wasconcerned, many companies switched to re-munerating their employees to a large ex-tent by stock options. The rising asset pricesalso led firms to make very optimistic assump-
tions regarding their pension scheme obliga-tions. As a consequence, the focus of man-agement was often narrowed to boostingtheir own company’s share price in the shortterm without taking due account of theircompany’s underlying performance. In somecases this took the form of exaggerated self-marketing, as happened when some start-ups abused the instrument of ad hoc disclos-ures on the Neuer Markt stock exchange seg-
ment. In other cases, such as in the USA,management often sought to meet marketexpectations by submitting supplementaryand uncertified financial statements. In these“pro forma” financial statements earningswere often overstated, in some cases by notlisting employee stock options as expenses.
As a result, the principle of “shareholder
value” was frequently turned on its head.Some audit firms showed increasing interestin acquiring additional consultancy contractsfrom enterprises whose financial statementsthey had to certify. Securities trading firmsfocused their attention more and more onlucrative IPO business, for which favourableanalyses were an important prerequisite.Such conflicts of interest harbour the dangerof overstating the profit situation and theprofit outlook. Insufficient monitoring of re-ported corporate earnings and overly optimis-tic forecasts had a similar effect. The qualityof market-relevant information has thus be-come a core issue to which the various eco-nomic policy decision-making bodies andcommittees will have to give intensivethought in the future at both a national andinternational level.

32Factors determining share prices
Even given reliable data, the task of assessing
the appropriateness of the equity market’svaluation would still be difficult and subjectto major uncertainty. Many investors rely onprofessional analysts’ earnings forecasts, al-though these are likewise not foolproof.Central banks, too, are partly reliant on suchinformation when making their own assess-ments. Ultimately, careful analysis of earningsforecasts is the only way to even approxi-mately recognise the danger of overvaluationin a reasonably timely manner.
Naturally, it is easier to recognise speculative
bubbles with the benefit of hindsight. Todayit seems clear that during the bull markets ofthe late 1990s the share prices of many com-panies, especially in the area of telecommuni-cations, media and technology (TMT), hadbegun to become decoupled from the funda-mentals. Herding behaviour on the part of in-vestors may be one reason for such overvalu-ation. The trend in securities investment isclearly moving towards involving institutionalasset managers, whose expertise and analyt-ical advantages can be beneficial to generalmarket developments. However, even profes-sional portfolio managers often have virtuallyno scope for taking positions against the mar-ket trend.
3That is how excessive swings can
come to acquire increasing momentum and,for a while at least, become self-perpetuatinguntil the trend eventually reverses.
Thus the massive collapse of share prices in
2000 took place at a price level which, meas-ured by fundamental ratios, was already con-sidered extremely high. One indication of this
is the average price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio)for companies listed in important market in-dices such as the German blue-chip shareprice index DAX or the Dow Jones EuroStoxxindex. In the mid-1990s DAX shares had al-ready attained P/E ratios which, on the basisof actual profits, averaged 26, and thus twicetheir levels in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Other indicators, such as a PLC’s share price
to cash flow ratio, show a similar picture.Looking at the overall market index, a veryclose correlation can be expected over themedium term between operating profit andreported profit. After all, dividend paymentsand other distributions ultimately depend onthe actual earnings trend. The average divi-dend yield on DAX shares declined corres-pondingly from around 4% at the end of the1980s and the beginning of the 1990s to1
12% by the end of the 1990s.
The fact that equity market quotations were
able to remain high for as long as they did,however, is due not so much to inefficienciesin the processing of information on equitymarkets, which may be suggested at firstsight by comparisons of the ratios mentionedabove, than to optimistic profit expectationsin the second half of the 1990s. Averageprofit growth expectations for DAX-listedcompanies for a rolling three-year period roseby more than 15% a year, compared witharound 7% in the late 1980s and early1990s. Looking back, these forecasts have

33proved to be unrealistic and exaggerated.
However, they were a key driving factor ofshare price movements until early 2000.
However, the pattern of development of a
given share price is characterised not just bythe prevailing market expectations concern-ing the company’s earnings but also by ex-pected returns on alternative forms of invest-ment such as, notably, fixed-income secur-ities. The long bull market in the second halfof the 1990s should thus also be seen in thecontext of the concurrent marked decrease ininterest rates on the capital market.
In addition, the stock market prices depend
on how investors assess risk. For a given levelof risk aversion, increased risk perception onthe part of investors can cause the sharesconcerned to come under pressure; converse-ly, their prices will rise once uncertainty re-cedes. In what are called “dividend discountmodels”, the implied risk premia contained inthe share price are calculated as residuals (seeexplanations on page 35).
4These approaches
rely on the idea that the fair valuation of anequity corresponds to the present value of allfuture dividends. Based on this frameworkthe implied risk premium can be derived bycomparing the expected total yield on the re-spective equity investment (the “internal”rate of return) with the yield on comparative-ly risk-free assets, interpreting the differentialas the premium required by investors for in-curring higher risk on the equity market.
The risk premium can vary considerably over
time as a function of the economic and polit-ical environment as well as of the state of themarket. A basis for assessing share prices is
given by comparing the premia contained inthese prices with historical values. If the pre-% p aEnd-of-month levels

4The three-stage dividend discount model widely used in

growth rates will converge to a long-run target rate
which in turn is composed of the long-term real interest
rate and the risk premium itself. See Panigirtzoglou, N

34mium is well below a “normal” value (which
is determined on a case-to-case basis), this in-dicates a relatively high level of valuation. Bythis token, the implied risk premium at thebeginning of 2000 on an equity portfolio em-bracing the DAX index was well below theaverage value of the end of the 1980s andthe beginning of the 1990s but has latterlyreturned to that level following the sharp fallsin share prices. In fact, there are many signsat the moment of the existence of a high riskpremium. For one thing, the geopolitical ten-sions caused by the Iraq crisis are weighingheavily on stock exchanges; for another,there is still great uncertainty concerning theoutlook for growth, which is expressed in thewide spread of corporate profit forecasts. Al-though this spread has narrowed somewhatsince spring 2002, it remains much greaterthan that prevailing at the time of the steepfall in earnings in 1994.
Implications of share price movements
on real activity
In view of the assessment of overall economic
growth which they imply, share price move-ments on the stock markets are often used asleading indicators of cyclical developments.Indeed, share prices usually do lead both con-sumer confidence
5and business confidence.6
However the underlying causes and effectscan vary greatly. Share price movements mayreflect market participants’ earnings pro-spects without causing them. But it is alsopossible that share price movements – via thewealth effects that they trigger, for instance –may themselves become a determinant ofbusiness activity. In that case, expectations re-
garding share price changes and changes inthe economic situation which they cause canbe mutually reinforcing.
The increased importance of shares as an in-
vestment instrument has also raised the po-tential for corresponding wealth effects tooccur. One important transmission channel isthrough assets held by households who con-sume not only out of current disposable in-come but also depending on the value oftheir savings. Econometric studies indicatethat the correlation between equity assetsand households’ consumption has indeed be-come closer over the past decade. These esti-mations, suggest that for a 3100 loss in Ger-
man households’ equity wealth, their expend-iture on consumption will decrease by 31t o
32. This is a very low ratio compared with
countries that have relatively large equitymarkets and a corresponding larger shareownership by households.
7Given the size of
the fall in share prices on the German equitymarkets, which last year alone amounted toaround 40%, this direct wealth effect couldtherefore have reduced consumption growth,based on the above computation results, bybetween 0.2 and 0.4 percentage point.Moreover, falling share prices may have con-tributed to the pronounced consumption re-straint via other transmission channels, too.

35Calculating the implied risk premium using dividend discount models
In a simple dividend discount model the value
of a share or, alternatively, the index beinglooked at when valuing the total market, isequivalent to the present value of all futureexpected dividend payments:
P
0X1
t1Dt
1Rt
where P 0is the current share price or index
value, D tthe expected dividend at time t and
Rtthe discount rate for the timespan t. The
discount rate, which can also be interpretedas the rate of return required by investors, ismade up of the risk-free interest rate for theperiod under consideration and a risk pre-mium which reflects uncertainty about futuredividends.
Assuming a constant payment ratio b_
the divi-
dend growth rate g in a steady-state equilib-rium corresponds to the return on equity ROEmultiplied by the retention rate 1-b_
.
1The re-
quired return on equity corresponds over thelong run to the cost of capital, which is madeup of an equity risk premium ERP and a risk-free interest rate r. If a constant rate g is as-sumed, then for the price level P
tthe follow-
ing equation holds:2
PtDt1g
ERPrÿg
where g = ROE (1-b_
). Since P t,Dtand r can all
be observed on the market, the implied riskpremium can be calculated. High share prices
indicate that market participants require onlya small risk premium for holding shares.
In the three-stage dividend discount model,
there are three distinct phases of dividendgrowth. For an initial phase of A years it is as-sumed that the dividend growth rate g is con-stant. Since a constant observable dividendpayment rate b_
is also assumed, in this stage g
can be calculated with the help of long-runanalyst estimates of profit growth.
3In a
second phase lasting B years, g is assumed tocontinuously approach its above-mentionedsteady-state equilibrium value, which itreaches in the third phase. The price level P
tis
approximated as follows:4

where g*is the dividend growth rate based

DtAB
2gÿg
ERPrÿg
reflects the portion of the value based on the
dividend growth of the first two stagesdeviating from the steady-state equilibriumvalue g. That way the implied risk premiumcan also be derived in this type of dividenddiscount model, where short-run deviationsfrom long-run dividend growth are takeninto account.
1The dividend growth rate g is positively correlated to the
retention rate 1-b_
because retained profits are invested in
the future growth of the enterprise. — 2It is assumed that
ERP +r > g. — 3Such estimates are provided, for example,
by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (IBES). —4This equation is based on the three-stage dividend
discount model developed by Fuller and Hsia. See Fuller, RJand Hsia, C-C (1984), A Simplified Common Stock ValuationModel, Financial Analysts Journal, September-October,

36However, owing to the extreme volatility of
share prices and the continuing heighteneduncertainty, it is impossible to tell whetherthe reactions of private investors to last year’sdecrease in share prices have run their course.It is likely that the marginal propensity to con-sume also varies among the different categor-ies of income and wealth. High-incomehouseholds with a large volume of wealthcan normally take declining share prices intheir stride, tending to base their consump-tion decisions more on their long-term in-come outlook. The fact that equity ownershipis concentrated precisely on such higher-income households may explain, at least inpart, the relatively low wealth elasticity of pri-vate consumption in Germany.
8As a source of corporate finance, the equitymarket has dried up for the time being duringthe current bear market. This, too, can havean adverse effect on economic growth; how-ever, in macroeconomic terms this effect isvirtually negligible since, even during theboom years from 1996 to 2000, the percent-age of total corporate finance in Germany ac-counted for by funds raised on the equitymarket was only around 7%. In individualsectors such as the technology sector, by con-trast, the acquisition of capital on the equitymarket played a much greater role in thesecond half of the 1990s.

37Estimating wealth effects
The relationship between wealth and consumption
is based on the permanent income hypothesis. Thishypothesis states that household consumption isdriven by (human and non-human) wealth – ie bythe present value of future income. Decomposinghealth into the current value of future labour in-come, on the one hand, and real and financial(non-human) wealth, on the other, the intertem-poral budget constraint faced by households can bewritten as follows:
A
t11rt1AtYtÿCt
Future real and financial assets A t+1are equal
to current non-consumed labour income Y t–C t,
remunerated at the rate r t+1, and current assets A t
remunerated at the same rate. Solving forward, thecurrent value of planned future consumptionequals the consumers’ total assets, ie real and finan-cial assets A
tplus the current value of their expect-
ed future labour income:

AtHowever, rising expected returns on assets have a
positive impact on the marginal propensity to con-sume.
This estimation approach, which postulates a con-
stant wealth elasticity and therefore bears only anindirect relationship to the long-run marginal pro-pensity to consume, contrasts with a method ofdirectly estimating a long-run marginal propensityto consume. It assumes that households base theircurrent consumption on expected future consump-tion and thus smooth it out over time.

By decomposing wealth into its components, both
the direct estimation approach and the indirectapproach
4can be used to estimate households’
marginal propensity to consume out of their equitywealth. For Germany the relevant asset data –which are available for the 1991-2001 period basedon the European System of Accounts (ESA 95) – pro-vide some indications. It is estimated that for everyeuro of change in equity wealth, the marginal pro-pensity to consume is estimated at between oneand two cents. That would mean that a 40% reduc-tion in household equity wealth would per se re-duce consumption growth by around 0.2 to 0.4 per-centage point.

38– hopefully only temporary – end to the hith-
erto feverish growth of the German venturecapital market. Previously the stock markethad been an important exit channel for ven-ture capital investors. The plummeting ofshare prices made this option unattractiveand thus also curtailed new investment op-portunities. The unprecedented slide in shareprices, particularly on the Neuer Markt , there-
fore also caused the net investment of ven-ture capital companies to grind to a halt.Newly established companies are beingfunded barely at all by venture capital at themoment, and follow-up investment in youngcompanies is being scaled back sharply. Evenif the macroeconomic significance of the ven-ture capital market is very small, the reluc-tance to invest is cause for concern that tech-nological innovation and growth stimuli,which have major long-term benefits, arebeing postponed.
Finally, domestic economic growth can de-
pend to a considerable degree on the state ofequity markets in other major economies. Forone thing, retail and institutional investorsalike are increasingly holding foreign equities.For another, the repercussions of stock mar-ket movements on the economies of othercountries are also relevant to Germany owingto firms’ international capital and tradinglinks.
Monetary policy implications
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy is geared to
ensuring stable consumer prices. The stabilityof asset prices – which also include shareprices – is not an autonomous objective of
monetary policy. Thus rising share prices maynot be inconsistent with stable consumerprices, if, for instance, they reflect corres-pondingly positive corporate growth pro-spects. However, rising share prices not justi-fied by the fundamentals can, through the as-sociated wealth effect, increase macroeco-nomic demand and thus cause consumerprices to rise. In the extreme, excessive swingsin either direction could have an adverse ef-fect on the stability of the financial system.
For these reasons, share prices play an im-
portant role as a monetary policy indicator,even though monetary policy is not geared toshare price developments. A major factor inthis context is the ability of share prices, inconnection with other indicators, to provideimportant information on potentially undesir-able developments. In this connection, theongoing analysis of credit and monetarygrowth has proved to be helpful. Experienceto date has shown that share price increasesnot justified by the fundamentals are associ-ated with increased lending and thus with ac-celerated monetary growth. However, a risein share prices which is accompanied by in-creased monetary growth does not necessar-ily indicate the formation of a “bubble”, be-cause fundamentally justified asset price in-creases, too, are likely to coincide withstronger monetary growth.
What this makes clear is that the appropriate
course of action for a central bank cannot beinferred from share price movements per se.It is more important that central banks ob-serve developments on equity markets closely

41The development of
production potentialin GermanyOverall production potential and the
output gap derived from it are keyvariables of economic analysis. Thatapplies just as much to an assessmentof the cyclical situation as it does tothe calculation of structural budgetbalances. Furthermore, the two vari-ables make it easier to assess themedium-term prospects for growth andincomes and to identify inflationarytensions at an early stage. Estimatesshow that the increase in German pro-duction potential in the second half ofthe 1990s was slower than in earlierperiods and in comparison with otherindustrial countries. During the pastyear, production potential is likely tohave grown by no more than around1
12% and the negative output gap
amounted to around 112%. In the
current year, the output gap is likely togo on widening.
The present situation in Germany is
thus characterised not only by amarked slowdown in the economy butalso by slow trend growth. Since thisgives rise to serious problems, thepresent article also discusses economicpolicy approaches for enhancing thegrowth path. It becomes apparent thatfurther economic reforms are needed– especially on the labour market – tocreate the conditions for renewed andsustained dynamic growth.

42The concept and significance of
production potential
Production potential and the relative devi-
ation of real gross domestic product (GDP)from that potential – known as the outputgap – are key concepts in macroeconomic an-alysis. Ignoring seasonal and irregular effects,GDP may be broken down conceptually intoproduction potential and a cyclical compon-ent.
With a given provision of natural resources,
potential – in the sense of overall productionpotential – is determined by the available pro-duction factors of labour and capital, thestate of technology as well as policies govern-ing the organisation of the economy andgrowth. It thus indicates how many productsin the form of goods and services can be pro-duced in a given period if the production fac-tors are deployed under prevailing conditionsin line with the longer-term average. Produc-tion potential which displays sharp growth istherefore generally regarded as a characteris-tic feature of a vigorous and innovative econ-omy, whereas low rates of potential outputgrowth often point to structural problems. Bycontrast, the cyclical component, which is re-flected in the output gap, provides informa-tion on the degree to which the potentialsupply is used. The output gap may thereforebe employed as an aggregate tension indica-tor for the product market providing, alongwith other variables, information on demand-side inflationary pressure.
Owing to its construction, the output gap is,
moreover, an important starting point for as-sessing cyclical effects on the government
budget balance. Thus, this variable – interact-ing with the responsiveness of the labourmarket and the specific design of the govern-ment system of taxes, levies and transfers –determines the level at which the cyclically in-duced part of the budget balance is to be es-timated and how important the automaticstabilisers are.
1Neither potential nor the out-
put gap can be observed directly, however.They have to be estimated. The calculationsmay rely either on methods which are purelystatistical or on ones based more on econom-ic considerations.
Many different estimation methods
Given its great importance, production po-
tential has to be estimated as precisely as pos-sible. There exists an almost untold numberof methods and variants available for this pur-pose.
2For the sake of simplicity, a distinction
can be made between approaches that aremore statistical or more theory-based. By sur-veying enterprises, it is also possible to obtaindirect information on the utilisation of theirplant capacity, but this cannot generally sub-stitute for an estimate of the overall outputgap. In Germany, such surveys exist only forindustry and construction. These two sectors,

43which together account for just under one-
quarter of total value added, display verywide cyclical fluctuations, however, which areby no means typical of the economy as awhole.
The statistical methods attempt to estimate
the underlying trend of overall output fromthe time series. A simple log-linear trend isoccasionally used, for example. As a constanttrend growth over long periods is often notvery plausible in economic terms, segmentedtrends with (specified) structural breaks arealso employed. Alternatively, the trend maybe construed as a purely stochastic variable.In this way, say, the cyclical component maybe determined by using a Beveridge-Nelsondecomposition.
3
Besides the trend functions, statistical filtersalso come into consideration. The often-usedHodrick and Prescott method,
4for example,
makes two requirements of a separation oftrend and cycle. First, the profile of the trendvalues should be as smooth as possible.Second, the actual values should deviatefrom the trend as little as possible. Sinceboth criteria are in competition, the relativeweighting of the smoothness and adjustmentproperties is set in advance. The higher theweighting of the smoothness criterion isset, the more strongly the trend values aresmoothed. There is an intense debate on theappropriate selection of this parameter.
5Es-
sentially, this concerns the question of howlong a typical business cycle is. For example,in the case of annual data, a smoothing par-ameter having the value of around eightcorresponds to a reference cycle durationof seven to eight years. The frequently used
value of 100 corresponds to a reference cycleof 16 years.
The length of the reference cycle is also cru-
cial for the band-pass filter as applied byBaxter and King.
6The band-pass filter defines
which fluctuations in the time series are to beassessed as cyclical and which as an irregularcomponent or trend. For annual data, for ex-ample, it is customary to use a (2.8) filter, iefluctuations which last for a minimum of twoyears and a maximum of eight years are re-garded as cyclical.
The practical advantages of filter methods lie
in the fact that they are straightforward interms of their technical application and thatthey may be applied in the same way to dif-ferent time series and are thus also suited todescribing stylised facts. Moreover, they arehighly transparent and easy to comprehend.Nevertheless, they also have major draw-backs: they are not explicitly anchored in eco-nomic theory, for example. Furthermore, at
3The cyclical component matches the predictable
changes in the time series; the trend is produced by a ser-
ies of unpredicted shocks. The frequently used univariate
decomposition often results in implausibly variable trend
profiles and is not examined in further detail below. On

44least the filter methods are predicated on the
cyclical phenomenon being describable interms of a symmetrical, comparatively regularfluctuation around a trend. Diagnosis of casesof very long-lasting overutilisation or under-utilisation is ruled out owing to their con-struction. Finally, applying such methods har-bours the risk of creating only spurious cycles,which play no more than a minor role in theunadjusted series.
In the more theory-derived methods, the pro-
duction potential is based explicitly on its eco-nomic determinants. Such methods include,say, the approaches oriented to the capitalstock used by the German Council of Eco-nomic Experts and the German Institute forEconomic Research. These methods arebased on the simplified concept of an aggre-gate production function with a limiting pro-duction factor. Estimates based on aggregateproduction functions with more than one fac-tor are also usual. This is the way in which theEuropean Commission makes its estimatesfor the countries of the EU.
7For a long time,
the Bundesbank also based its estimates ofGerman production potential on a – some-what more flexible – production function.
8
The relevant vector-autoregressive modelsmay also be counted among the structuralapproaches. In these models, shocks whichdrive the business cycle are identified by long-term restrictions. Such calculations have theirtheoretical basis in models of aggregate sup-ply and demand.
The advantage of such theory-based methods
is that they allow more detailed informationto be gained concerning the factors under-lying potential growth. They thus yield more
in terms of both analysis and economic policy.By decomposing the components, the causesof decelerations or accelerations in growthcan be identified and defined more closely.Nevertheless, the distinction between statis-tical and theory-based approaches is, in prac-tice, less strict than it may first appear. Filtersand trend adjustments are also needed instructural approaches, for instance. That ap-plies, say, to the approximation of technicalprogress, which is not directly observable,and to the rate of structural unemployment.In the single factor approach as well, poten-tial capital productivity is determined using atrend adjustment.
Estimation results
As mentioned above, the Bundesbank used
to base its estimation of potential on anaggregate production function,
9in which
overall output depends on the input factorsof labour and capital and on technology. Pro-duction potential was calculated by estimat-ing the function parameters and by insertingpotential values for the input factors. Follow-ing German reunification, however, the im-

based on the assumption of a substitution elasticity of
one between the production factors of labour and cap-
ital. See C Denis, K McMorrow and W Roeger (2002),

tion, the substitution elasticity is not a priori set at one.

45plementation of this concept produced con-
siderable practical problems. Attempts to esti-mate a CES-type production function in aself-contained approach showed implausibleparameter values, for example. Furthermore,the function proved to be structurally incon-stant. It is true that an attempt can be madeto eliminate these estimation problems
10by
determining the coefficients using multi-stage approaches or on the basis of linear ap-proximations. For the purposes of calculating
the potential, this procedure proves to be notvery robust, however.
Below, therefore, potential will be deter-
mined using a non-parametric approachwhich combines economic concepts and stat-istical methods. Using a growth decompos-ition, the rate of change in GDP ( Dln(Y)) is dis-
tributed among the contributions made bythe input factors of labour (L) and capital (K)and the change in total factor productivity(Dln(A)). The symbol adenotes the income
share of the factor labour.

When calculating the potential growth rate,
potential values are inserted for the produc-tion factors and total factor productivity.These are produced by means of a statisticalprocedure employing a Hodrick-Prescott filterwith a smoothing factor of 100.

46tion to be based on a broad class of produc-
tion functions.
Nevertheless, a number of problems arise
with regard to the data. At present, for ex-ample, data on fixed assets for the period be-fore 1991 calculated in accordance with thenew standard – ie based on ESA 95 – do notexist. The same applies to the number ofhours worked. In both cases, therefore, therates of change according to the old calcula-tion standard were used as a stopgap. Thebreak in the statistics resulting from Germanreunification may be eliminated by chainingthe time series. This is based on the assump-tion that, at the time of unification, GDP ineastern Germany roughly matched potential.In the light of more detailed studies, too, thiswould appear to be plausible.
12On groundsof data availability and comparability, the fol-
lowing comments relate to the national econ-omy as a whole. Owing to the end pointproblem when using filter methods, a con-sensus forecast is used below.
The results of the non-parametric method
are shown in the adjacent chart. For 2002,growth in production potential is thus around1
12% and the output gap is roughly -112%. A
comparison over time reveals that the growthrate of production potential may be rated asdecidedly low. Overall capacity utilisation isalso low, although its figure last year was stillabove the level typical of periods of recession.This means that, at present, a period of cyclic-al slowdown is coinciding with only moderatetrend growth. Seen in this light, the Germaneconomy is suffering from a chronic weak-ness of growth and sluggish demand.
Comparison with other methods
The scientific literature has proposed a num-
ber of criteria for assessing output gaps.

These criteria may be adopted for the pur-pose of comparing the results of the non-parametric method with the values producedby other approaches. According to those cri-teria, the estimates of the implied output gap%

47should not be in stark contradiction with the
available findings of surveys on enterprises’capacity utilisation. Although such surveys, asexplained above, are not, by themselves, anappropriate criterion for determining theoverall output gap, they do constitute theonly information which is ascertained directlyand not just estimated. For that reason, it isan obvious matter to check whether the cyc-lical turning points implied by the estimationmethods match those of the surveys. Thechart on this page does show, in fact, thatthe cyclical turning points of all the methodsunder consideration here bear quite similardates.
Statistical properties of the time series are
also important for assessing the estimates.The fluctuation intensity of changes in poten-tial should, on average, be smaller than those
in GDP , for instance. Furthermore, the impliedoutput gaps, when viewed over the longterm, should not deviate significantly fromzero. Above and beyond that, the output gapshould not display any trend since a businesscycle, by definition, can only have a limitedduration. Calculations using selected proced-ures show that the cited criteria are mostlyfulfilled. There are exceptions, however. Thefluctuation intensity of survey-based potentialis just as high as that of GDP itself, for ex-ample. This is not the case for the othermethods used.
The output gap is also regarded as an indica-
tor of inflationary tensions. What informationcontent its estimated value has for futureprice developments may be examined using%

0,b1,b2andb3denote the coefficients to
be estimated. Studies show that most of theoutput gaps display a significant unidirection-al influence on the inflation rate. However,this does not apply to those methods whichassume a very flexible trend profile.
The usual methods of calculating the output
gap are, in themselves, quite useful indicatorsof inflationary pressure. Nevertheless, by wayof qualification, it has to be pointed out thatthe output gap is no more than one explana-tory factor among several for general infla-tion. Surges in costs (wage-price spirals) or li-quidity overhangs are often also an importantfactor. Moreover, the calculation above givesthe results of an in-sample forecast. Theout-of-sample forecasting properties of suchequations are generally less satisfactory.
For a cyclical analysis and any monetary or fis-
cal policy conclusions that may be drawnfrom it, it is important to know the unavoid-able margin of error when calculating poten-tial and the output gap and to keep it assmall as possible. One indication of the stabil-ity of the underlying relationships is if newlyadded values do not essentially change theestimate of potential for the past.
15In order to test the sensitivity or robustness ofthe methods used here with regard to add-itional data, the procedures investigated wereapplied step by step to the 1990s. Revisionsof the original data were ignored
16and fore-
casts were left aside when using the filtermethods. The results show that the estimatedvalues change – in some instances, signifi-cantly – with all the methods if additional val-ues are incorporated into the estimate. Thecalculations for the end of the series aretherefore invariably to be interpreted withcaution. There are no apparent qualitative dif-ferences between the various methods, how-ever.
All things considered, there exists a notable
margin of uncertainty concerning the currentsize of the output gap. Which of the variousestimation approaches is to be preferred isnot the only factor. A certain margin of errorremains, in fact, even if the dataset and theestimation method are not at issue.

Implications of decelerating
potential growth
Irrespective of the specific estimation method
applied, most of the calculations for Germanyshow a noticeable slowdown in potentialgrowth since the mid-1990s. A continuationof this trend would have far-reaching implica-tions.
Low trend growth will not lead per se to the
German economy becoming more suscep-tible to fluctuations – in other words, the sizeof the trend deviations will not necessarily in-crease. Instead of the growth cycle typical ofthe post-war period, however, periods of (ab-solute) decline in the overall output levelwould occur more frequently than before.This might intensify pressure on monetaryand fiscal policymakers to take discretionarymeasures even in the event of only minor de-viations from the trend as a fall in level hasoften been a sign of severe economic crisis.
Persistently low potential growth would also
have serious consequences for the labourmarket. The connection between the labourand product markets may be illustrated by arelationship which has entered the literatureas Okun’s Law. This states that an increase inemployment (or a decrease in unemploy-ment) takes place only when there is percep-tible growth in overall output. The long-termpotential increase in employment depends onthe “employment threshold”.
18This value de-notes the growth rate of overall output at
which, with a given supply of labour, employ-ment starts to increase (or unemploymentstarts to decrease). If the production potentialgrowth rate cannot be increased, the employ-ment threshold has to fall if unemployment isto be reduced. Real wage moderation canplay a substantial part in this.
Low potential growth also restricts the scope
for distribution in wage policy. Further weak-ening of potential growth may lead to an in-crease in the structural unemployment rate ifthe smaller scope for distribution is not takenfully into account in the wage formation pro-cess. A study for the United States
19at-
tributes the extremely positive developmenton the US labour market in the 1990s to aphenomenon of this kind in reverse. Therapid productivity growth in the United Stateswas reflected only very slowly in the wageformation process, although the increased is-suance of share options to employees admit-tedly also played a part in this. This resulted ina period of real wage moderation which re-duced trend unemployment. As empirical cor-roboration for this hypothesis, reference ismade to the fact that the trend in the un-employment rate and the trend rise in labourproductivity in the USA moved in opposingdirections, ie unemployment tended to fall inperiods of high productivity growth and vice
versa.

50Potential growth is also of major importance
for fiscal policy since it represents the scopefor growth in spending if the tax and socialsecurity ratio or the deficit ratio are to remainunchanged. Furthermore, potential growthhas a substantial impact on the long-termrelationship between the deficit and debtratios. In the long run, the debt ratio (ratio ofgovernment debt to GDP) converges to avalue measured by the relationship betweenthe deficit ratio and the nominal rate ofgrowth. Thus, a constant 60% debt ratio (theceiling as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty),given, say, a nominal 5% growth rate, wouldbe compatible with a 3% deficit ratio. Givenreal potential growth at 1.5%, keeping thegeneral inflation rate below 2% (in line withthe stated objective of the ECB) yields anaverage nominal growth rate of, at most, 3%to 3.5%. The mathematical deficit ratio for adebt-to-GDP ratio of 60% that is stable in thelong term would have to set lower according-ly. What also has to be taken into account isthat the Stability and Growth Pact contains amore far-reaching commitment to achievinga budget which is structurally “close to bal-ance or in surplus” so as to lower the debtratio on a permanent basis.
Economic policy approaches to
strengthening potential growth
Irrespective of the method of calculation,
what has been written above leads to theconclusion that the rate of increase in produc-tion potential in Germany is, at present, slowin comparison with western Germany beforereunification and other industrial countries,especially the United States (see chart on
page 51). The ECB estimates potential growthfor the euro area to be between 2% and2
12%. Although potential growth in western
Germany in the early 1980s was not muchhigher than now either, it later acceleratedagain markedly.
Now, Germany has been in a period of quasi-
stagnation for more than two and a halfyears and future prospects are quite subdued.At the same time, countries showing a cyclic-al profile similar to that of Germany in the1990s have been able to achieve higher eco-nomic growth and a significant reduction inunemployment. This points to a structuralgrowth weakness in Germany. In this connec-tion, the slump in investment over the pastcouple of years has to be a cause for increas-ing concern, particularly as fixed asset forma-tion was by no means broadly based or buoy-ant anyway. Capital expenditure on replace-ment and renovation now accounts for three-quarters of total gross asset formation andthe net investment ratio is currently at nomore than 3
12% of GDP . Apart from replace-
ment and renovation, only investment in ra-tionalisation continues to play a significantrole. Given an increase in the capital stock(excluding dwellings) of less than 2% annual-ly, this means that there is virtually no scopeleft for creating additional jobs.
The problems besetting a unified Germany
have undoubtedly also played a considerablepart in the growth slowdown of the Germaneconomy. Unity did offer numerous advan-tages as well as fresh possibilities, but the in-discriminate adoption of many west GermanProduction

51regulations and of a pay policy that placed an
excessive strain on east German firms’ prod-uctivity meant that a lot of opportunities werenot used. As a result, the restructuring processand the adjustment crisis in construction ineastern Germany as well as the high level ofwest-east transfers are weighing on growth inthe German economy as a whole.
A large number of empirical studies – such as
that by the German Council of Economic Ex-perts
21– show that the medium-term growth
differentials between economies are due todifferences, first, in the factors which pro-mote growth (fixed asset formation in thecorporate sector, formation of human capital,research and development, price stability, de-gree of openness of the economy and publicsector investment) and, second, in factors im-peding growth (direct and indirect taxation,government debt, social security contribu-tions, rigidities on the factor and productmarkets). This widely held view is shared, forexample, by the authors of a working paperpublished by the OECD.
22This paper uses a
cross-section study to show that privatisationand liberalisation on product and labour mar-kets tend to enhance the growth of total fac-tor productivity – the most important elementinfluencing overall potential growth.
From an economic point of view, high un-
employment represents a major unused pro-duction potential. The inadequate deploy-ment of the production factor labour may betraced back, not least, to rigidities on thelabour market, which result in a high level ofstructural unemployment. Conditions on thelabour market are the key to understandingthe weakness of growth. Thus, the factor
labour has made only a minor contribution toeconomic growth in Germany over the pastfew years in comparison with other Europeancountries and, in particular, the United States.According to IMF calculations, the low degreeof wage moderation exercised for a long timein Germany was a contributory factor inthis.
23In contrast to other countries, substan-
tial wage substitutes, including generousregulations on early retirement, have led overtime to a high reservation wage. There hasalso been insufficient differentiation in pay.1991=100

52Moreover, the effective marginal burden of
the factor labour has increased. It is essentialto correct such undesirable developmentsand make the labour markets significantlymore flexible if the pace of growth is to accel-erate.
Weak growth can be overcome with resolute
reforms, especially as the German economystill has its strengths. Its products continue tobe very competitive in terms of price andquality, for example. German exports’ worldmarket share is clear evidence of this.
24Also,
Germany is a country with a generally goodinfrastructure. Analyses of technological effi-ciency and innovative capacity show that theGerman economy – notwithstanding all itsspecific problems – still has comparative ad-vantages. This means that essential under-lying conditions for faster growth continue tobe in place.

53German balance of
payments in 2002Economic and political uncertainty also
left their mark on Germany’s transac-tions with non-residents in 2002. Afterall, the tensions associated with theIraq conflict, the falling prices on thestock markets and the shifts in ex-change rate patterns did not providean environment that encouraged alasting recovery in the world economy.Despite these difficult underlying con-ditions, German exporters were fairlysuccessful in maintaining their positionon their foreign markets, which weregrowing more slowly. At the sametime, weakness in domestic demandresulted in a discernible decline in theimports of goods. These factors, to-gether with a substantial improvementin the terms of trade, enabled thetrade surplus to expand to a “record”5126 billion. Consequently, the surplus
on current account also rose sharplyto 2.3% of gross domestic product. Inthe case of financial transactions theuncertainty on the part of internation-ally operating investors was reflectedin a discernible reluctance to makecross-border investment and a prefer-ence for “safe” assets. This ultimatelyresulted in net capital inflows into Ger-many through both portfolio invest-ment and direct investment and, at thesame time, to substantial outflows ofcapital in the field of non-securitisedcredit transactions.

54Current account
German exporting enterprises did not operate
in an easy business environment last year.They had to contend, for example, with thedetrimental effects posed by uncertaintyabout future developments in the worldeconomy and demand on major export mar-kets. It is true that world economic growthaccelerated to an estimated 3% in 2002(from 2
14% a year earlier); however, German
export markets grew much more slowly. An-other factor was the appreciation of the euroand the associated concerns about what ef-fects the deterioration in price competitive-ness would have on German export turnover.All of these factors were reflected in a down-turn in orders received from abroad, especial-ly in the second half of 2002. It was underthese circumstances that the real expansionin the exports of German enterprises amount-ed to only 1
12% (compared with almost 6%
in 2001). Despite that, sales of German prod-ucts on the more sluggishly growing exportmarkets fared rather well. German exportersprobably maintained their world marketshare for the most part. The appreciation ofthe euro has not had a very noticeable impacton the export of goods so far because, in thefirst place, about 43% of German exports goto other euro-area countries and becausethere has been virtually no change in Ger-many’s competitive position with respect tothese countries. Generally speaking, the lossin German price competitiveness on an aver-age of 2002 therefore amounted to only1.5% while the effective appreciation of theeuro amounted to 3%. In the second place,German enterprises are still benefiting fromthe improved market conditions during the
first few years of monetary union, with theresult that Germany’s relative competitiveposition was still fairly favourable even at theend of 2002. Furthermore, experience hasshown that exchange rate movements takesome time to influence trade flows.

55euro area. In those countries whose general
economic output grew more rapidly than thatof the euro-area countries German exportersrecorded a 2
12% increase in turnover al-
though this increase varied considerably fromone country to another. At 7
12%, growth in
turnover in central and eastern Europe wasparticularly strong. Since trading with thesecountries has been growing continually moreintense for some years, they now account for11
12% of total German exports. There was
also a particular momentum in the trade withChina (+19
12%), which last year was one of
the fastest growing countries in the world.German exporters also achieved significantincreases in turnover (+6
12%) in their trade
with the OPEC countries, which continued tobenefit from substantial income from oil. Bycontrast, trade with the United States de-clined discernibly. Turnover fell by almost 2%in 2002 whereas a year earlier there had beenan increase of almost 10%. Exports of Ger-man products to the United States, whoseshare of German foreign trade amounts toapproximately 10
12%, have probably been
curbed most by the falling demand for capitalgoods in the United States and possibly alsoby the appreciation of the euro against theUS dollar. Much the same is presumably trueof Japan although Japan has much less im-pact on the development of German foreigntrade. Exports to Japan actually fell by morethan 7% on an annual average of 2002.Owing to the persistent weakness in econom-ic growth in Japan, however, exports to Japanhad been declining in the previous year, too.The virtual absence of economic recovery inthe euro area was probably the main reasonfor German producers’ modest growth inRegional trend in foreign trade

56sales there. Exports to the other euro-area
countries grew by less than12%, thereby putt-
ing a discernible brake on external stimuli,given these countries’ enormous importancefor German exporters.
Almost all economic sectors in Germany were
affected by the generally moderate foreigndemand.
1Given the sharp decline in invest-
ment in machinery and equipment in manycountries, exports of capital goods, which,with a share of 46%, are an extremely im-portant part of German exports, fared com-paratively well (-
12%). The car industry, whose
export turnover in 2002 – as in the previousyear – increased significantly (5%), was amajor driving force here; this also enabledsuppliers to increase prices. By contrast,manufacturers of ICT goods recorded a reduc-tion in their export business (-4
12% in nom-
inal terms). However, lower prices, particular-ly in the case of IT products where priceswere reduced by more than 4%, depressedthe value of exports. The year-on-year fall inexport turnover in the chemical industry waseven sharper, at 7%, although here, too, areduction in export prices (-1.2%) played arole.
The divergence in export price trends in the
individual economic sectors shows that enter-prises responded in different ways to the spe-cific competitive conditions in their respectiveexport markets and to changes in their owncost structures. However, to some extent pri-cing might have been influenced by particularregional trading relationships and the choiceof invoicing currency. While approximately75% of all German exports are invoiced ineuro and 16% in US dollars, in trade withcountries outside the euro area only 54% ofexports are invoiced in euro and almost 29%in US dollars. To maintain market shares, es-pecially in the dollar area, German exportersmay have reduced some of the euro sellingprices. Overall, however, there was hardly anychange in export prices in 2002 (-0.1%).
In the year under review imports of goods
were just under 4% below those in the previ-ous year. In 2001 they had risen by approxi-mately 1%. To a large extent, however, thereduction in the value of imports is a reflec-tion of price effects; import prices fell by2002

572.5%. Both the appreciation of the euro and,
despite the increase in oil prices towards theend of the year, the more favourable prices ofenergy imports curbed prices on the importside. Even so, imports declined in real terms,too, owing to the depressed demand in Ger-many; they were down by 1
12%.
The declining demand for imported goods af-
fected almost all supplier countries. For ex-ample, the imports of goods from the UnitedStates fell by 13% year on year. Much of thisfall is probably the reflection of price effectsstemming from exchange rate movements.At approximately 17%, the decline in thecase of Japan was even greater in terms ofthe average rate of change over the year –and this despite the fact that Japanese ex-porters had already sustained huge falls insales on the German market in the previousyear (-14
12%). Much the same can be said
of suppliers in the emerging economies inSouth-East Asia, who experienced a 7% fallin sales in Germany. Imports of goods fromthe OPEC countries fell by 15
12% in 2002;
this was due not only to the decline in the im-port prices of crude oil but, evidently, alsoto a decline in the imported volume. At allevents, Germany’s imports of energy sourcesin 2002 were substantially below the level inthe previous year (-11
12%). Given the fact
that German imports of goods from othereuro-area countries are largely unaffected byexchange rate factors, the year-on-year fall of2% in value is essentially a reflection of thelower domestic demand for imported goods.Trade with the transition countries in centraland eastern Europe constituted one import-ant exception to the generally negative devel-opment in imports even if suppliers from
these countries were no longer able toachieve the former high growth rates in Ger-many either. After all, the sales of these coun-tries in Germany in 2002 rose by 2
12%.
Owing to the close production ties, the cen-tral and east European countries further ex-panded their position in German foreigntrade both on the import and on the exportside.
The lower level of output in Germany is also
reflected in the breakdown of imports by cat-egory of goods.
2For example, the value of
imports of semi-finished goods in 2002 was14% lower than in 2001. The demand forforeign capital goods was likewise down onthe previous year in terms of value (-8%); thisreflects a corresponding downturn in invest-ment in machinery and equipment in Ger-many and affected foreign manufacturers inthe IT sector (-12
12%) and foreign manufac-
turers of mechanical engineering products(-10%), in particular. Only the imports of con-sumer goods slightly exceeded the previousyear’s level (by
12%).
As a result of the divergent movements in ex-
ports and imports, the trade balance againrose sharply in 2002 and closed at a record3126 billion; this means that it was 330
12bil-
lion more than in the previous year. Further-more, the current account benefited from asmaller deficit on invisible current transactionswith non-residents. When taken together, allof these developments expanded the surpluson current account to 349 billion whereas the

58current account balance in 2001 had been al-
most in balance (+ 31 billion). In terms of gross
domestic product the current account surplustherefore amounted to 2.3%.
The year-on-year decline in the deficit on ser-
vices was much greater in 2002 for the firsttime since the 1980s. The deficit fell by 313
billion to just under 338
12billion. This was
due to a 9% increase in income and a 2% de-crease in expenditure. The main reason forthis divergence was the outcome of insuranceservices and other services in which a broadrange of different services is listed. The sur-plus in the case of insurance services surgedfrom just under 31 billion in 2001 to 36
12bil-
lion last year. This was due primarily to asharp rise on the income side. The muchgreater income of re-insurance companiesfrom contributions and premiums since theterrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 wasnot offset in 2002 by corresponding expend-iture on claims for damages. Contrary to thetrend in the past few years when the deficithad steadily increased, net expenditure in thecase of the other service transactions fellbelow the previous year’s level for the firsttime in more than ten years. Following adeficit of almost 325 billion in 2001, the
sub-balance ran a deficit of approximately316
12billion last year. Net expenditure de-
clined principally in the case of patents and li-cences as well as in the case of advertisingand trade fairs and the film industry. More-over, there was an increase in the net incomefrom government services.

59account last year.3In 2002 the foreign travel
account ran a deficit of 336 billion, approxi-
mately 3112billion less than in 2001. Owing
to the uncertain economic and earnings pro-spects and possibly also as a result of terroristattacks in holiday countries, German resi-dents evidently reduced their expenditure ontravelling abroad more sharply (-3%) than didforeigners travelling to Germany (-1
12%). Ex-
penditure by German holiday makers andbusiness travellers on trips to the UnitedStates fell particularly markedly – by almostone-fifth. As it is precisely the longer-haultrips overseas that often have to be bookedwell in advance, it was evidently here that themore favourable prices in these destinationsresulting from the appreciation of the eurofailed to have a positive effect. Conversely,US travellers spent less in Germany in 2002than in previous years. There was hardly anychange in the amount spent on travelling toother euro-area countries which account forabout half of total travel expenditure. Finally,expenditure on trips to the central and eastEuropean countries, which have been enjoy-ing greater popularity in recent years, in-creased slightly (+1%).
Net expenditure in the case of cross-border
factor payments declined in 2002 by justunder 34 billion to 36
12billion. This was due
primarily to developments in investment in-come expenditure, which declined by almost34 billion more than income and, conse-
quently, reduced the deficit on investmentearnings to just under 36
12billion. Owing to
the uncertainty on the share markets, bondshave been in great demand by investors forsome time, a development which is reflectedin increasing cross-border payments of bond
yields. Income in 2002 increased by almost31
12billion faster than expenditure. Although
this means that the shifts in interest rate andexchange rate patterns did not have a dis-cernible effect on bond interest payments,they appear to have contributed substantiallyto the improvement of 31
12billion in the bal-
ance on credit interest payments to a surplusof just over 31 billion. The deficit on proceeds
from direct investment was almost un-changed at just over 3
12billion in 2002.
Owing to the poor state of profitability inmany enterprises, both domestic and foreign,income and expenditure each declined by32
12billion.
The deficit on current transfers to and from
non-residents declined by approximately31 billion to 326
12billion last year. The deficit
in the case of public transfers fell by almost31
12billion to just over 31512billion as the
net payments to the EU budget went downby31
12billion to just under 311 billion. This
decrease was due both to the larger pay-ments to Germany from the EU budget inconnection with the structural policies and tothe small payment by Germany to the EU, es-pecially as a result of the smaller EU share inGerman revenue from value added tax. Bycontrast, the balance on private-sector trans-fers deteriorated by 3
12billion and ran a def-
icit of 311 billion. One of the reasons for this
was the increase in insurance payments tonon-residents. Capital transfers were almost

60Deutsche BundesbankCapturing foreign travel in the balance of payments statistics from January 2001
This issue of the Monthly Report contains data on foreign
travel which have been obtained for the first time by meansof a new collection system. This change became necessary be-cause the quality of the data that had been used hitherto forestimating foreign travel declined significantly as a result ofthe introduction of euro banknotes and coins on 1 January2002 or the data sources themselves ceased to exist.
Until the end of 2001 data on the receipts from and expend-
iture on foreign travel were collected indirectly. The relevantinformation was not obtained from the travellers themselvesbut from banks and credit card companies which settle alarge proportion of travel transactions by buying and sellingforeign currency and settle payments made through ec cardsand credit cards. This information was supplemented by re-ports from tour operators on their cross-border transfers andby data from some European partner countries on the buy-ing and selling of Deutsche Mark banknotes in their respect-ive home markets. The monthly receipts from and expend-iture on travel were estimated on the basis of this informa-tion.
As many travel-related transactions are still settled in cash,
the introduction of euro banknotes and coins resulted in anot insignificant information gap, especially in the euro-areacountries,
1some of which are among the most important
partner countries for German foreign travel; this appliesboth with respect to estimating the level of travel expend-iture and establishing the regional breakdown. A direct sur-vey of travellers on the basis of household samples nowmakes up for the lack of this information. The survey is basedon the foreign travel of (domestic) residents and the totalamount they spend on it. This survey has now been under-taken on an ongoing basis since the beginning of 2001 inorder to compare the new results with the data collectedunder the old method for at least a year and to be able tosubject the findings to a quality test.
The figures extrapolated on the basis of the survey for 2001
show that the resident population in Germany made about167 million foreign trips during that year and spent a total of558 billion on these. Expenditure previously shown in the
balance of payments for this period had amounted to 551
12
billion and was therefore 11%, or just over 56 billion, lower
than the extrapolated survey result.
Generally speaking, the seasonal pattern of the new data on
foreign travel is fairly consistent with the pattern of the datacollected under the old system. However, the expenditure inthe summer months – when travel is at its peak – had pre-viously been underestimated. One reason for these seasonalshifts is that under the collection system used until the endof 2001 it was often difficult to establish precisely when thetrips associated with the payments by ec cards and creditcards had actually been made. In the case of the householdsample, by contrast, the actual date of the trip can be deter-mined more accurately because the persons participating inthe survey are asked the times of the trip and the relatedpayments.
A comparison of the old and new compilation methods leads
to different results with respect to the regional breakdown.
– In the case of the EU countries the results of the survey are
almost entirely in line with the earlier data. For example,the discrepancies in 2001 amounted to slightly more than1% in the case of these countries as a whole and to as littleas
12% in the case of the euro-area countries. The new
data also confirm earlier calculations, which had shownthat the previous method of estimating had probablybeen tending to overstate German travel expenditure inthe case of some countries such as Italy and the UnitedKingdom. The level of expenditure established by thehousehold survey is also confirmed by the correspondingdata from the partner countries in these instances.
– Larger discrepancies occur in the case of countries outside
the EU. According to the results of the survey, expenditureby German travellers outside the EU was 56
12billion, or
38%, more in 2001 than had previously been estimated.Evidently the estimated use of Deutsche Mark banknotesas a payment medium in these countries had been far too
1Problems also arose in a number of countries outside the euro
area where the use of Deutsche Mark banknotes had previouslyplayed a special role. Turkey, for example, is a case in point. —

few classic holiday countries outside the EU, notably Tur-key and some central and east European transition coun-tries such as Croatia, Hungary and Bulgaria, for which ear-lier studies had already indicated an underestimation. Thetravel expenditure now being established by the new com-pilation method is also greater in the case of some long-haul destinations than the level previously published inthe balance of payments. For example, the level of travelexpenditure in 2001 was 13% higher in the case of theUnited States and 30% higher in the case of the devel-oping countries.
All in all, the results of the household survey are fairly reli-
able in the case of foreign travel expenditure as a whole andin the case of the regional breakdown of the most importantdestinations. As already mentioned, this is confirmed by thecorresponding results provided by the respective countriesthemselves. This means that the results of the samplingprocedure can be used not only to close the information gapvis-à-vis the euro area. They can also be used for countriesoutside the EU despite the greater differences between theold and the new data.
While the direct survey provides a satisfactory quality of for-
eign travel data on the expenditure side, the side which isclearly of greater importance in Germany’s case, the situationis less favourable on the receipts side. There is no substitutein this case for the loss of information on the use of cash.Consequently, travel receipts in the case of the euro-areacountries can be estimated only on the basis of the data onpayments made by ec cards and credit cards and by bank set-tlements that are still available. This information will be usedin combination with the monitoring of possible changes inpaying habits (for example, whether greater use is beingmade of cash instead of the ec card since the introduction ofeuro banknotes and coins in the destination country) to ex-trapolate total receipts from foreign travel. The accommoda-tion statistics provided by the Federal Statistical Office areused to check the calculations. This provides a reliable indica-tion of the trend for most of the euro-area countries. Thecorresponding data from the major partner countries are
also included in the calculations. An increase of more than51 billion is obtained on the receipts side as a result of the
annual revision for 2001. However, this change is due mainlyto late reports.
To prevent breaks arising from the changeover to the new
system, a development which would be likely in the case ofcountries outside the EU in particular, country-specific andregion-specific factors, which apply to earlier years (in somecases dating back to 1971), are calculated on the basis of thefigures for the “link” year of 2001. Survey results for 2002 arealready available up to the end of the third quarter. For thefourth quarter of 2002 and all subsequent years the initial re-sults of the household survey will be available five monthsafter the respective reporting period at the earliest, forexample, not before the end of August 2003 in the case ofthe first quarter of 2003. For that reason provisional figureswill have to be estimated. The existing trend up to the endof 2002 will be updated for all euro-area countries and othermajor destination countries and regions using an ARIMAestimate. The outcome of test calculations for 2001 has indi-cated that this is possible with acceptable results for a limitedperiod. Analyses based on the remaining primary data willalso be made in order to take account of special effects in2002 – for example, the impact of the terrorist attacks of11 September 2001.
Overall, the sample survey has reliably closed the gap that
had arisen in foreign travel data in the euro area. Further-more, the survey has the advantage that additional informa-tion on, for example, the reason for the trip (business or pri-vate), the duration of the trip, the mode of transport usedand the percentage of package holidays is now available. Asa result, the analyses of a wider range of issues will be pos-sible. Owing to the increase in sampling error,
2however, the
availability of country results is restricted, and this mustbe seen as a disadvantage of the household survey. This isalso the reason why in future quarterly and annual resultswill be published only for major destination countries andregions.

had been a deficit of just under 312billion.
Financial transactions
Sluggish growth in the world economy, finan-
cial scandals – especially in the United States –and the smouldering Iraq crisis overshadowedevents on the international financial marketslast year. This led to – sometimes massive –losses on the share markets, and global bondyields fell sharply again. At the same time,the euro recorded rapid and sustained gainsduring the year. Internationally operating in-vestors showed greater risk-awareness inthis environment and became discernibly re-strained in their cross-border investments.This can be seen both in the declining flowsof capital to and from Germany and in thecomparatively moderate amounts of fundswhich residents and non-residents alike wereinvesting internationally in securities and cor-porate participating interests. The upshot wasnet capital imports through portfolio transac-tions and direct investment and in the caseof non-securitised credit transactions muchgreater outflows of funds from Germany. Asa result, aggregate net capital exports far ex-ceeded the current account surplus recordedfor 2002, a development which indicatesproblems in the statistical recording of finan-cial transactions and makes the analysis ofthe balance of payments more difficult.
Net capital imports through portfolio invest-
ment alone were somewhat greater, at337 billion, in 2002 than in the year before
(326
12billion). However, the rise in the netflows conceals the overall restraint observed
in the case of internationally operating invest-ors last year. German investors, in particular,showed far less interest in pursuing the inter-nationalisation of their portfolios than theyhad done in earlier years. For example, theyacquired no more than 369 billion worth of
securities issued by foreign borrowers in 2002compared with 3129
12billion in 2001. This is
the smallest amount German savers have in-vested in such paper for six years.
Despite the fact that the falling capital market
yields during the year would have providedholding gains, German residents significantlyreduced their investment, especially new in-vestment on foreign bond markets. Their in-vestment of 351 billion in longer-term foreign
debt securities in 2002 was only slightly morethan half the sum they had invested in thispaper the year before ( 395 billion). As euro-
denominated bonds have normally accountedfor the bulk of German acquisitions of bondsand notes since the start of monetary union(2002: 349
12billion), it is possible that, in
addition to the general increase in the prefer-ence for liquidity, the significant decline lastyear in the yield advantage of bonds issued inother euro-area countries over comparableGerman paper played a role in the downturn.At the end of 2002 the yield advantageon ten-year government bonds was only13 basis points. However, owing to thestrength of the euro and the positive interestrate spread that existed almost throughoutthe year vis-à-vis the United States or Japan,for example, German investors did not regardforeign currency issues as an attractive alter-native either (acquisitions in 2002: 31 billion).Trends in

63Much the same is also true of foreign equi-
ties, which make up only a very small part ofGerman investors’ portfolios. At 35
12billion,
their investments in foreign shares in 2002amounted to only a mere fraction of the aver-age sum that they had invested in this instru-ment over the past few years. Evidently, Ger-man savers responded to the uncertain eco-nomic climate and the less optimistic expect-ations of many enterprises about their profit-ability, a state of affairs that was reflectedthroughout the world in a sharp fall in shareprices. The exchange rate risk, which wasconsidered significant, may also have been acontributory factor in the reluctance to investin cross-border shares outside the euro area.A clear example of this investor behaviour isprovided by the United States where – not-ably in the first half of the year – news aboutbalance sheet “irregularities” in major firmsadditionally curbed the incentive to invest inthe share market. Overall, German residentspurchased no more than 3
12billion worth of
US equities whereas on an average of 1999,2000 and 2001 they had invested about316
12billion in this type of paper. The reluc-
tance to invest in foreign shares was also ap-parent in the equally dwindling interest in in-vestment fund certificates of foreign origin(37 billion), which traditionally invest a large
part of the funds they receive in foreignshares. By contrast, German savers increasedtheir demand for foreign money marketpaper ( 36 billion) whereas in the previous
year they had sold such paper for 31 billion

64posite direction, ie in the case of foreign in-
vestment in Germany. Total securities acquisi-tions by non-residents in Germany in 2002amounted 3106 billion compared with 3156
billion a year earlier. This means that theywere actually lower than in 1998 and 1999.

One reason for last year’s decline is the ex-tremely weak performance in the final quar-ter of 2002 when foreign investors withdrewfunds from the German securities marketsafter using German paper as a safe haven, es-pecially in the summer months. The reversalmight also have had something to do withnon-residents’ uncertainty about the out-come of the fiscal debate in the fourth quar-ter of 2002 even though non-residents wouldhave been largely unaffected by the regula-tions under consideration.
Non-residents’ diminished propensity to in-
vest was particularly noticeable on the Ger-man share market. For example, their ex-penditure of 317 billion on German shares
was just under one-fifth of the amount thathad flowed into Germany in this way in2001. That is still an enormous slump even ifaccount is taken of the fact that the fall in thevalue of share transactions captured in thebalance of payments was in line with the fallin share prices.

Deutsche Bundesbank4It was only in 2000 that net portfolio investment by
non-residents in Germany in recent years was lower than
in 2002. However, the result at that time was due to a
statistical book transfer in connection with a major cor-
porate acquisition. See Deutsche Bundesbank, German

65discouraged non-residents from investing
more on the German share market. Therewere actually small net outflows of capital inconnection with German investment fundcertificates in 2002 whereas in the previousyear non-residents had invested as much as31 billion in investment companies’ share cer-
tificates.
Contrary to this general trend, the sum of in-
vestable funds which foreign investors spenton German interest-bearing securities – ielonger-term bonds and notes and moneymarket paper – amounted to 389
12billion
last year. That was 323 billion more than in
2001. However, there were divergent devel-opments in the individual maturity segmentsand in the various instruments. Last year, forexample, non-residents invested fairly heavilyin Federal bonds ( 349 billion), which are re-
garded as a safe haven in times of politicaluncertainty and which, in terms of the usualyield spreads between German governmentbonds and the bonds of other euro-areacountries in previous years, were a compara-tively favourable investment. The situationwas somewhat different in the case ofprivate-sector bonds, however. These attract-ed no more than 330 billion in foreign funds
compared with 373 billion in 2001. Owing to
investors’ strong preference for liquidity, how-ever, there also appears to have been shiftsfrom bank debt certificates into money mar-ket paper. At all events, paper with a maturityof one year or less was very popular with for-eign investors last year. They bought 310 bil-
lion worth of it after appearing as sellers(315 billion) in this market segment the year
before.Given the rugged world economic climate,
the three-year-long bear market on stock ex-changes and the uncertain global securitysituation, Germany experienced a fairly satis-factory level of inward and outward direct in-vestment last year.
631412billion net flowed
into Germany through direct investment in2002 whereas in the year before there hadbeen net capital exports of 39 billion in this
field.
In 2002 foreign enterprises invested 340
12
billion in Germany, which was actually some-
what more than in the previous year ( 338 bil-
lion). As in previous years it was primarily en-terprises domiciled in other euro-area coun-tries, as well as some from the United King-dom and the United States, that continued toexpand their presence on the German mar-ket. Even so, despite the recent success in at-tracting foreign capital and given the eco-nomic strength of Germany, enterprises innon-euro-area countries still engage in lessdirect investment here than in other euro-area countries. Germany, with a share of justunder 32% in the euro area’s gross domesticproduct, accounted for only 13% of the in-vestable funds that flowed into the euro areain 2002. It is possible, however, that a sub-stantial part of direct investment from non-euro-area countries also flowed into Germany
6According to estimated figures from UNCTAD, there
was a 27% decline in direct investment worldwide last
year. There also appears to have been a reversal in the
direction of the main flows of direct investment. For ex-
ample, countries such as the United Kingdom and the
United States sustained serious reductions in inward
direct investment (-75% and -67% respectively) whereas
investment in the euro area fell by only 16%. The euro
area attracted 3130 billion, which is estimated to be just
under one-quarter of total global direct investment last
year. In 2001 it had amounted to about 20%.... German

66via holding companies domiciled in neigh-
bouring countries. That would explain thefairly large proportion of investment under-taken by euro-area enterprises in Germany.
Conversely, German firms invested 326 billion
abroad in 2002 after extending their sphereof activity abroad by another 347 billion a
year earlier. The decline was due not onlyto the fall in goodwill but presumably alsoto poor profitability of German enterprises.
Moreover, the excessively optimistic expect-ations in the telecommunications and IT sec-tors, which had long been the driving forcebehind cross-border acquisitions, increasinglygave way to a more realistic assessment ofthe situation. It is interesting in terms of aregional breakdown that German firms soldparticipating interests on balance in theUnited States last year ( 31 billion) whereas in
previous years the United States had almostalways occupied the leading position amongthe host countries with respect to Germandirect investment. In the United Kingdom aswell as in other euro-area countries, by con-trast, German enterprises strengthened theirinternational presence – even if here, too, theamounts invested were smaller.
The figures on German outward investment
shown in the statistics were also depressed bythe large amounts borrowed by German en-terprises from their branches abroad (reverseinvestment). These loans are often used as ameans of passing on the proceeds from inter-national bonds which German enterprises’financing subsidiaries domiciled abroad haveissued there. Loan repayments reduced Ger-many’s participating interests abroad by ap-proximately 328 billion.
As in the case of portfolio investment and dir-
ect investment the non-securitised cross-bor-der financial operations of public authoritiesresulted in net capital imports (of 35
12billion)
in 2002. The Federal Government drew onfunds which had accrued to it from the auc-tion of UMTS licences and which it was nowwithdrawing from its foreign accounts. Enter- 5 bn

67prises and individuals also reduced their bank
balances abroad on balance and used someof the funds to finance their acquisition ofcross-border participating interests. All in all,they repatriated 34 billion last year.
A substantial countermovement to the afore-
mentioned capital imports occurred in thebanking sector (including the Bundesbank’sexternal transactions that are classified ascredit transactions), which recorded net out-flows of funds amounting to 3137
12billion in
2002. German credit institutions accountedfor3102 billion of this sum, predominantly at
the short end of the market ( 389 billion). As
in the previous year the outflows of fundsstemmed primarily from the non-securitisedlending operations of German credit institu-tions, ie the granting of advances and loansto foreign partners, which expanded far morequickly than the corresponding deposits andborrowing operations. At the same time,funds amounting to 335
12billion were ex-
ported via the accounts of the Bundesbank.This money was primarily in connection withasset balances arising within the payment sys-tem TARGET.
The foreign reserves of the Bundesbank,
which are shown separately from the credittransactions in the balance of payments, de-clined by a further 32 billion at transaction
values last year after falling by 36 billion in
each of the previous two years. If calculatedat market prices at the end of 2002, the de-cline in the foreign reserves was even greater,at just over 38 billion, owing to the weakness
in the US dollar. At 31 December 2002 theGerman foreign reserves amounted to 385
billion.
The net capital exports arising from the non-
securitised credit transactions of the bankingsector often greatly exceeded the net pay-ments received from the other current andfinancial transactions with non-residents re-cently. In the balancing system used in thebalance of payments this has resulted in“statistically unclassifiable transactions”, ie abalancing item. Statistical recording problemsin connection with the introduction of eurobanknotes and coins, higher reporting thresh-olds and the large turnover in portfolio invest-ment might have contributed to the tendencyof this statistical “gap” to increase. To im-prove the data quality the portfolio transac-tions recorded in the balance of paymentsstatistics were rechecked to ensure their com-pleteness and plausibility. By virtue of thechanges in stocks recorded in the safe cus-tody account statistics it was possible to allo-cate part of the unclassifiable transactions toportfolio investment, with the result that thestatistical discrepancies could at least be re-duced through additional estimates. The bal-ancing item for 2001 after the revisions nowamounts to 311
12billion, but for 2002 it is
still as much as 328 billion. As the results of
the safe custody account statistics are not yetavailable for last year, however, this figuremight be revised downwards later.Credit
