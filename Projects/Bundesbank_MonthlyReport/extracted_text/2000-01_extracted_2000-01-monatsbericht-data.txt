5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeAccording to initial calculations by the Federal
Statistical Office, overall output in 1999 –after adjustment for variations in the numberof working days – was 1.3% higher than ithad been in 1998 (+ 1.4% in terms of calen-dar month); overall output in 1998 – likewisein working-day-adjusted terms – had in-creased by 1.9%. External influences werethe main reason for the slower pace ofgrowth. The critical situation in a number ofAsian emerging markets had a marked nega-tive impact on world trade, which, for a time,adversely affected the German export sector.This contractionary effect was only partly off-set by an upward tendency in domestic de-mand, especially as the momentum of this,too, waned when seen as an annual average.However, after early weakness, economic ac-tivity picked up again noticeably during 1999.
ManufacturingPowerful stimuli to that development were
coming from industry up to the end of theperiod under review. In November of last year(more recent statistical information is unavail-able at present), there was a further seasonal-ly adjusted rise in incoming orders in that sec-tor. In the two autumn months of Octoberand November combined, there was an in-crease of just under 3% compared with thelevel in summer. The year-on-year rise, whichhad amounted to roughly 5% in real terms inthe third quarter, went up to around 11%.Changes in the group of firms subject to re-Gross domestic

6porting requirements as well as several par-
ticularly large-scale orders were significantfactors in this, resulting in the underlying eco-nomic trend being overstated somewhat.
Domestic ordering was especially buoyant in
autumn. On an average of October and No-vember, it was 4% up, seasonally adjusted,on the average level of the summer months.There was a 7
12% rise on the year in new
orders, compared with no more than a14%
increase in the third quarter. The sharpest ex-pansion was in the capital goods sector,whereas orders placed with producers of dur-able and non-durable goods stagnated.
In the first two autumn months, seasonally
adjusted orders received from abroad wereonly slightly higher than in the precedingthree-month period, the figure for which hadalready exceeded the comparable level in1998 by no less than around 13%. At theend of the period under review, there hadbeen a further increase to 16
12%.
According to the available statistical informa-
tion, manufacturing output in November didnot quite match its October level in seasonallyadjusted terms. The figures are still provision-al, however, and will very probably be revisedupwards. At present, in the two-monthperiod of October and November, a seasonal-ly adjusted decline of
12% compared with
the summer quarter is shown. It should beborne in mind, however, that the monthly fig-ures have hitherto invariably been increasedin the quarterly surveys; the adjustment forthe third quarter amounted to around 2%.This also affects the year-on-year comparison,Economic conditions in Germany*

7which currently shows a growth of 1.9% on
an average of October and November.
ConstructionThe cyclical recovery in the construction sec-
tor has not continued during the past fewmonths. In October 1999 – more recent stat-istical information is unavailable at present –seasonally adjusted incoming orders wereagain lower than in the summer, which haditself already shown a decline. The level waslatterly almost 2% below the comparable fig-ure for 1998.
The present deterioration is largely due to a
slump in demand for residential construction,which was especially pronounced in easternGermany. Orders placed by public sector con-tractors were likewise somewhat lower thanbefore. It was only with industrial firms thatmore contracts were concluded.
Seasonally adjusted construction output in
November was somewhat down on the pre-ceding month. In October and November,taken together, it did exceed the level in thesummer quarter; however, it is expected thatthere will be a significant upward adjustmentfor this period as part of the yearly overallsurvey. In the two autumn months there wasno more than a slight year-on-year growth inoutput of
14%.
Labour marketThe situation on the labour market has
brightened a little over the past few months.There has been no further fall in employment,for example, and the number of unemployed
declined somewhat. Initial estimates by theFederal Statistical Office reveal that the sea-sonally adjusted number of people in work inOctober, at 36.1 million, was no longer downon the month, although it was still 0.2%down on the year.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell in De-
cember to somewhat above 4 million, inwhich the mild winter weather was also afactor. The decline over 12 months becamelarger again, reaching 150,000, having dwin-dled to just under 10,000 in October. Theseasonally adjusted unemployment ratereached 10.4% in the fourth quarter, com-pared with 10.7% a year before. In westernGermany, it amounted to 8.6% and the cor-responding figure for eastern Germany was18.1%. As an annual average, 10.5% of thelabour force in Germany was registered asunemployed in 1999, compared with 11.1%in 1998.
PricesIn seasonally adjusted terms, there was a fur-
ther slight rise in consumer prices in Decem-ber. The year-on-year increase went up to1.2%. In the fourth quarter as a whole, therate was 1.0%, compared with 0.7% in thepreceding three-month period and 0.3% inthe first quarter of 1999. At 0.6%, the an-nual average rate of price increase was justunder
12percentage point less than in 1998.
Energy prices, in particular, have contributed
to the recent increase. Apart from heating oiland petrol, gas charges were also affected;Orders received

8only electricity prices showed a further fall.
Besides this, there was a further quite signifi-cant increase in charges for services, whichwere 0.8% higher in December than a yearbefore. Accommodation costs were 1.2%higher than 12 months previously. By con-trast, price developments in the case ofmanufactured goods and food remained verymoderate.
The price situation on the oil markets has
eased noticeably during the past few weeks.On the one hand, production in some coun-tries may have been stepped up somewhat,while, on the other, the fact that the winterhas been quite mild so far has dampened thedemand for heating oil. The internationalprices quoted for crude oil and mineral oilproducts have therefore shown some down-ward movement. In early January, the spotmarket price for Brent North Sea Oil fell tojust under US$ 24 per barrel, having beenover US$ 26 one month previously.
Seasonally adjusted, there was a further sig-
nificant rise in German domestic industrialselling prices in November last year. (More re-cent data are unavailable at present.) The dif-ference in the price level when comparedwith the same period in 1998 went up to+ 0.7%, following a year-on-year fall of0.7% in the third quarter. Whereas electricity,in particular, slowed down the inflationarypressures, manufactured products alone be-came 1.3% more expensive compared withone year earlier.Public finance
Federal cash trendsAs is usual for this time of year, the Federal
Government recorded a cash surplus in De-cember; at 314
12billion (DM 2812billion), it
was considerably larger than last year’s figurefor that month (just over DM 19 billion). Whileexpenditure declined slightly, revenue showedstrong growth, increasing by just over 9%,partly as a result of voluminous proceeds fromprivatisation. In the Federal Government’s cashposition for 1999 as a whole, a 3.4% increasein revenue was accompanied by a 3.1% rise inexpenditure. The cash deficit incurred by theFederal Government amounted to slightly over329
12billion (DM 58 billion), and was thus
approximately as high as one year before. Inthe budgetary definition and based on thedata currently available, the deficit amountedto slightly more than 326 billion or just over
DM 51 billion, compared with DM 56
12billion
in 1998.1The figure projected in the 1999
budget had exceeded the actual result byDM 2
12billion. One reason for this – apart
from an increase in tax receipts – was thattotal expenditure fell below budgetary esti-mates.

authorities rose very steeply in November byalmost 313

9this, amounting to just under 3912billion,
took place through the sale of securities; theremaining amount was procured by taking uploans against borrowers’ notes and short-term cash advances. The Federal Governmentwas the most prominent borrower, its netborrowing having reached 38 billion. The
bulk of this sum was acquired by selling Fed-eral bonds amounting to almost 35 billion
net and five-year special Federal bonds worthjust under 34
12billion. For the first time,
the Federal Government obtained short-termborrowed funds also through the sale of Fed-eral discount notes equivalent to 31
12billion.
Redemptions prevailed among the remainingdebt types. The ERP special fund was able toreduce its borrowing slightly. By contrast, the“German Unity” fund expanded its debt byjust under 3
12billion net; here the funds ac-
quired through Federal bonds issued jointlywith the Federal Government exceeded theamount of redeemed bank loans. The LänderGovernments’ indebtedness rose very steeplyby just under 35 billion. The main reason for
this was that the traditional Christmas bonuspayments to employees led to a large de-mand for funds. The Länder Governmentsprocured the required funds primarily by tak-ing up loans against borrowers’ notes ( 32
12
billion) and through short-term cash advances
by banks (just under 3112billion). The indebt-
edness of the local authorities is likely to haveremained virtually unchanged in November.

eral Government amounted to just over 38

terms of their amount, just over three-quarters of the issues were denominated ineuro. Net of redemptions and including thechanges in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds, net sales came to 319.8 billion, com-
pared with 313.2 billion in the preceding
month. On balance, as in October, it was pre-dominantly short and medium-term paper(with maturities of up to four years) that wassold, with the focus being on paper with amaturity of up to one year. Foreign bondswere sold in the domestic market to the ex-tent of 34.1 billion net. They were made up

with 32.1 billion in the previous month. On
balance, foreign equities were sold in Ger-many to the tune of 37.5 billion (October:
34.4 billion), with portfolio investments pre-
dominating. Altogether, the amount raised inthe domestic equity market came to 310.7
billion in November, compared with 36.5 bil-
lion in October.
In November, foreign investors added Ger-
man shares amounting to 34.7 billion net to
their portfolios. Domestic credit institutionspurchased equities worth 34.0 billion (net);
32.8 billion was invested in domestic paper.
Domestic non-banks’ share portfolios rose by32.0 billion. On balance, mainly foreign equi-
ties were purchased ( 36.3 billion).
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds was smaller in November, at 34.8 bil-
lion, than a month earlier ( 35.6 billion).
About two-thirds of this amount was receivedby the specialised funds ( 33.3 billion). Bond-
based funds were the main object of invest-ors’ interest ( 31.6 billion). Mixed funds and
share-based funds received 30.8 billion and
30.6 billion net, respectively. Open-end real
estate funds sold investment fund certificatesto the tune of 30.2 billion. On balance, the
funds open to the general public receivednew capital amounting to 31.5 billion. The
share-based funds among the funds open tothe general public sold certificates to theamount of 32.5 billion. Mixed funds and
pension investment mutual funds (Altersvor-
sorgefonds) received 30.4 billion and 30.1billion, respectively. Open-end real estate
funds redeemed certificates to a minor extent(–30.1 billion). Bond-based funds and
money market funds, however, recordedlarger outflows of funds worth 30.8 billion
and 31.1 billion, respectively. Certificates of
foreign funds were sold in the domestic mar-ket to the extent of 33.1 billion net. The total
amount raised by selling investment fund cer-tificates thus came to 37.9 billion in Novem-
ber, compared with 36.4 billion in the previ-
ous month.
The investment fund certificates were mainly
bought by domestic non-banks ( 34.8 billion),
which focused on foreign certificates ( 33.1
billion). Credit institutions’ holdings of invest-ment fund certificates rose by 31.7 billion.
Non-residents purchased certificates of do-mestic investment funds amounting to 31.3
billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a slight sur-plus of 30.2 billion in November 1999 com-
pared with the deficit of 31.9 billion in Octo-
ber. This was mainly the result of the signifi-cant rise in the country’s export surplus.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, Germany’s foreign trade surplusincreased from 35.8 billion in October to
38.0 billion in November. In seasonally ad-
justed terms it rose by 31 billion from the
previous month to 36.3 billion in November.Share

13Exports and imports both rose sharply in sea-
sonally adjusted terms in the month under re-view. Exports grew almost 8
12% faster than
in the previous month (in which they hadactually shown a slight decline); in thetwo-month period October-November theytherefore exceeded their value in August-September by just over 2%. Imports likewiseincreased considerably in November, beingjust under 7% more in seasonally adjustedterms than in October. In terms of value,however, there was no further rise in importsin a two-month comparison.
At37.7 billion, the deficit on invisible current
transactions was roughly the same in Novem-ber as in October although the deficit did in-crease in seasonally adjusted terms. Thus,contrary to the seasonal trend, service trans-actions with non-residents ran a somewhatlarger deficit than in October ( 33.6 billion
compared with 33.0 billion in the previous
month), partly as a result of the fact that netexpenditure on foreign travel did not declineas much as usual at this time of year. Therewas a deficit of 31.5 billion on factor income
in November compared with one of 32.1 bil-
lion in the previous month. At 32.6 billion
(October 1999: 32.5 billion), the deficit on
current transfers in the month under reviewwas much the same as the average duringthe previous few months.
Portfolio transactions with non-residents re-
sulted in a substantial net influx of capital inNovember 1999 ( 315.5 billion) whereas
there had been a net outflow of funds in thissector ( 31.3 billion) in October. The main rea-

ing again somewhat more heavily in Germanbonds and notes ( 36.5 billion) and participa-
tory securities ( 34.4 billion). 31.3 billion in
foreign funds also flowed into German invest-ment fund certificates. German investors alsoshowed far greater interest in foreign secur-ities during the month under review ( 312.8
billion compared with 35.9 billion in Octo-
ber). They paid greatest attention to foreignshares ( 36.5 billion), bonds and notes ( 34.1
billion) and investment fund certificates ( 33.1
billion).
Net capital exports amounting to 37.8 billion
were recorded as a result of direct investmentin the month under review. This arose fromthe investment by German enterprises of37.5 billion abroad and, conversely, the re-
duction of 30.3 billion in foreign owners’ dir-
ect investment in Germany. Short-term finan-cial transactions between affiliated enter-prises were the reason for this.Non-banks’ unsecuritised cross-border credit
transactions resulted in the export of 32.6
billion net. Enterprises and individuals ac-counted for 31.0 billion of this and the trans-
actions of central government for 31.6 bil-
lion.
The net external position of the entire bank-
ing system (excluding the monetary reservesof the Bundesbank) – which reflect the re-maining statistically recorded current and fi-nancial transactions – rose by 312.9 billion.
This was largely attributable to the increase inthe net external assets of the Bundesbank(319.6 billion), which, in turn, is mainly due
to balances within the payment systemTARGET. The increase in Bundesbank assetswas partly offset by inflows of – largely short-term – foreign funds amounting to 36.7 bil-
lion to the German credit institutions.

15The integration of
the German moneymarket in the singleeuro money marketSince the transition to the single mon-
etary policy of the Eurosystem on Janu-ary 1, 1999, central bank interest rateshave been unified and the banking sec-tor has been supplied with central bankmoney by means of unified monetarypolicy operations. It goes without say-ing that the Eurosystem can gear suchoperations only to the total liquidity ofthe banking sector in the euro area.However, the traditional purely nation-al distribution of central bank moneyno longer suffices to ensure that theliquidity created by the refinancingoperations ultimately becomes avail-able precisely where it is needed. Anefficient liquidity redistribution systemthroughout the euro area is thereforerequired as well: the smooth function-ing of cross-border money trading, ofcross-border liquidity/interest-rate arbi-trage and of the payment infrastructureneeded for the purpose is vital for theimplementation and operation of asingle monetary policy.
Both the integration of the European
interbank money market and the Ger-man segment of that market are exam-ined in the present article. As there is adirect connection between the creationand distribution of central bank money,the article is preceded by an analysis ofinitial experience of the “new” monet-ary policy instruments.

16The money market as the operational
point of departure of the central bank,and initial experience of the range ofmonetary policy instruments of theEurosystem
Money-market management by the central
bank is a combination of interest-rate and li-quidity management. The transmission ofmonetary stimuli starts in the money marketand works through the other credit and fi-nancial markets, as intermediate stages, tothe real economic sphere. In the execution ofmonetary policy, the monetary policy instru-ments and procedures that are to be analysedin more detail in the following pages play dif-fering roles.
The range of policy instruments envisaged for
the operational framework of the Eurosystemis quite extensive, compared with the Bun-desbank’s policy instruments.
1Not least
owing to the existence of a minimum reservesystem acting as a liquidity buffer, however,not all of them actually have to be employed.The concentration on a few regular andstandardised operations not only is conduciveto transparency but also facilitates the directparticipation of smaller banks in monetarypolicy operations. In the euro area, bankshave, on balance-sheet grounds (i.e. notcounting the minimum reserves), a “struc-tural” need for refinancing by the centralbank system. By introducing minimum re-serves, the Eurosystem further reinforced thebanking system’s dependence on refinancingto the tune of just over 3100 billion (with
Germany accounting for approximately one-third), and thus put money-market andinterest-rate management on a sustainably
sound footing. Altogether, the refinancingoperations total some 3185 billion (annual
average in 1999).
Changes in the minimum reserve systemJust as under the Bundesbank’s system, the
minimum reserves are designed in such a wayas to act as a general and individual liquiditybuffer. Minimum reserve requirements haveto be complied with only as a daily average ofthe maintenance period, viz. from the 24
thof
the month until the 23rdof the following
month. Hence credit institutions can toleratedaily changes in their central bank balances inthe course of the maintenance period, in theexpectation that such fluctuations will bal-ance out on average over the period. On theone hand, this makes daily fine-tuning of theoverall liquidity situation by the central bank,and thus fine-tuning measures with an “ex-clusive” range of banks, largely unnecessary.On the other hand, the minimum reserve sys-tem gives credit institutions scope for individ-ual liquidity operations, taking due accountof interest-rate expectations.
German credit institutions are familiar with
the mode of operation of a minimum reservesystem. That applies, for example, to the fact(still apparent today) that the overnight inter-est rate – given the buffer function of theminimum reserves – responds in a characteris-tic way to the given provision of liquidity; in

17other words, if the daily or average balances
are high relative to the required reserves, ittends to fall, and vice versa.
Upon the launch of monetary union, how-
ever, some changes supervened for Germanbanks, too. A special new feature, besidesthe shifting of the start of the minimum re-serve periods (which last for one month, asbefore) from the 1
stto the 24thof a month, is
the payment of interest on the required min-imum reserves at the rate applied to main re-financing operations. In this way, induce-ments to circumvent minimum reserve obliga-tions disappear. This is the more significantfor Germany as a financial centre since theminimum reserve requirements for the Ger-man banking system increased by nearly one-third upon the launch of monetary union.
2
Another thing that has changed, from theGerman point of view, refers to the typicalpattern of minimum reserve compliance (seethe adjacent chart), with several factors hav-ing played a role: payments are now clearedby the Bundesbank largely without a float.Formerly, large surpluses arose owing to thefloat, especially at the beginning of the main-tenance period. Moreover, the reserve main-tenance period has not coincided with thecalendar month since the beginning of lastyear. In general, German credit institutionsnow usually enter the maintenance periodwith a substantial level of under-compliance,from which the average balances gradually“recover” in the further course of the period.
The reserve maintenance profile in the euro
area as a whole, by contrast, is already closerto the required reserves at the start of theperiod. An explanation of this difference may
be provided by the inflows and outflows of li-quidity in the field of German banks’ cross-border payments, which have a marked im-pact on credit institutions’ daily balances atthe Bundesbank (see the chart overleaf). Inview of the size of their liquidity buffer, Ger-man banks are evidently not obliged immedi-ately to offset a liquidity outflow in paymentsat the beginning of a reserve maintenanceperiod – such as seems to be “typical” on ac-count of TARGET movements from outsidethe euro area.

2The key reasons for that were the extension of the re-

maturities of up to two years (previously: up to less than

vis-à-vis non-residents, and the setting of a reserve ratio

18Italy around the turn of the reserve mainten-
ance period appears to give rise to cross-border money-market trading on the part ofGerman banks – at least if banks’ ideas of themaintenance profile, which are mainly affect-ed by interest-rate expectations, do not standin the way.
Interest-rate corridor determined
by standing facilities
The stabilising function of the minimum re-
serve system for the money market is supple-mented by the two standing facilities of theEurosystem, namely the marginal lending fa-cility and the deposit facility, which form the“interest-rate corridor” for fluctuations in theovernight rate.
3Whereas, in its function, the
marginal lending facility corresponds to theBundesbank’s former lombard loan facility,
the instrument of the deposit facility is newto credit institutions in this country. Thanks tothat facility, credit institutions can invest sur-plus liquidity overnight, albeit at an interestrate which is distinctly below the main lend-ing rate.
In the first few weeks of monetary union, the
ECB Governing Council kept the interest-ratecorridor narrow, at 2.75% and 3.25%. Asthe chart on page 19 shows, during thatperiod there was on some days simultaneousheavy recourse to the marginal lending facil-ity and the deposit facility, since liquidity re-distribution through the market – especiallythat across national borders – still had to getproperly warmed up. Simultaneous recourseto both facilities is an indication of poor func-tioning of the market. However, the heavy re-course to both standing facilities was fairlysoon reduced to an unavoidable frictionallevel of recourse, particularly after the inter-est-rate corridor had been widened to 2% to4.5% by the ECB Governing Council. Theonly notable feature remained the oftenheavy recourse to the deposit facility aroundthe final day of the reserve maintenanceperiod. Before the launch of monetary union,the Bundesbank had tended to leave the bal-ancing of random fluctuations in liquidity atthe end of a reserve period to lombard loans, 5

3The capping of the overnight rate by the marginal lend-
ing rate applies, strictly speaking, to collateralised money
market operations since collateral is required for recourse
to the marginal lending facility as well. If, in exceptional
cases, the interest rates for collateralised and uncollat-
eralised operations diverge by more than just a few basis
points, then the uncollateralised EONIA rate could theor-
etically exceed the marginal lending rate. In practice, this
has not occurred yet (not even under the exceptional cir-
cumstances of the millennium change).Initially narrow

19thus showing a preference for a tight liquidity
supply on the last day of the period. In con-trast to that approach, in the course of lastyear the ECB tended to supply the moneymarket with abundant liquidity, so that sub-stantial recourse to the deposit facility anddeclines in the overnight rate were often re-corded towards the end of the reserve main-tenance period.Main tenders as the prime source
of liquidity
Liquidity is supplied in the Eurosystem, except
in the special case of marginal lending,through open market operations with, as arule, two-week and three-month maturities.The greater part of these operations, at justunder 3140 billion (annual average) or three-
quarters of the volume of refinancing, ismade up of main refinancing operations,which are offered at weekly intervals and runfor two weeks each. The average number ofparticipants in this form of refinancingamounted to 775. 545 of the bidders camefrom Germany, accounting, on an annualaverage, for about one-half of the amountallotted.
4This reflects the heavy liquidity re-
quirements of the German banking system,not only in absolute terms but also relative tothe banking system of the entire euro area,mainly owing to the large amount of DM cur-rency in circulation.Daily figures

4The number of counterparties admitted to standard
open market operations (credit institutions subject to re-
serve requirements and satisfying the operational/tech-
nical conditions set by the respective national central
bank for such operations) amounts in the euro area to
just over 2,500 (out of a total of just under 8,000 banks
in all). In Germany alone – reflecting the divergent Ger-
man banking structure – roughly 1,550 out of about
3,000 banks are admitted, i.e. about one-half. Thus, the
fairly decentralised German banking system provides
roughly two-thirds of the institutions admitted to the
main and basic tenders of the Eurosystem. That is, how-
ever, some 750 banks fewer than were admitted to the
securities repurchase transactions of the Bundesbank up
to the end of 1998. This decline is accounted for, first, by
the continuing merger process in the savings bank and
cooperative bank sectors, and especially by the fact that
participation in the tender procedure of the Eurosystem
presupposes a link to the Automatic Bidding System
(ABS), which, even though it does not pose any major
technical or cost problem, has not been effected by a
number of institutions.Three-quarters

20From the German standpoint, the main tenders
link up seamlessly with the preceding securitiesrepurchase transactions of the Bundesbankwith the same maturities. The Bundesbankseized the opportunity thus offered to updatethe method of collateralisation and to make itmore convenient for credit institutions. Theearmarking of underlying assets for a particulartransaction was replaced by what is known asthe “pooling” solution. The salient feature ofthis mode of collateralisation is simply that thetotal pool of assets in the pledge account mustat all times at least cover the total amount offunds outstanding; the level of “free” collateralmarks out the scope for intra-day credit in pay-ments. The newly created option of cross-border recourse to collateral likewise contri-butes to the more convenient settlement ofrefinancing operations.
In 1999, all main refinancing operations were
offered in the form of fixed-rate tenders, withthe interest rate announced in advance.
5In
expectation of a scaling-down (a phenom-enon with which German credit institutionsare quite familiar), the banks in all memberstates submitted very large bids, thus settinga “bidding race” in motion. This race was fos-tered not least by the fact that the necessarycollateral is to be furnished only upon thecrediting of the allotment amount and not al-ready at the time of submission of the bid.The low allotment ratios – for a long time inthe second half of the year, around 4% to7% – are regarded as a disadvantage, andcriticised, by the national banking systems inthe euro area that deplore a low residualstock of collateral for central bank refinancingpurposes.The Eurosystem responded to the bidding
race by providing ample liquidity. The objectwas to keep the overnight rate consistentlynear the main tender rate, in order to deprivecredit institutions of an incentive for overbid-ding. Although this had the desired effect ina number of cases, a radical change in bid-ding behaviour has not been achieved. This isprobably because, in the case of a fixed-ratetender, (partially) refraining from two-weeks’refinancing from the central bank because ofmore favourable terms in the overnightmoney market (which may last only a fewdays) constitutes too high an interest-rate riskfor a bank. It is, after all, noticeable that, atthe beginning of a reserve maintenanceperiod, the overnight money-market ratequickly settles down again above the maintender rate even if it “slumped” markedlybeforehand.
The most obvious, and presumably best, op-
tion for coming to terms with the overbiddingphenomenon would be a transition fromfixed-rate to variable-rate tenders, usingwhat is known as the “US-style” allotmentmethod. Under that system, there is no incen-tive for the bidding banks to submit bids atan unrealistically high level because everycredit institution successful in such a tender ischarged the interest rates it has bid. However,such a change can only be contemplated if itis appropriate in monetary policy terms aswell.
5The interest rate for main refinancing operations was
3% at the beginning of last year; it was lowered to

21Basic tenders
The second type of regular open market op-
eration is the longer-term refinancing oper-ation running for three months, which, at anannual average of 347 billion last year, ac-
counted for roughly one-quarter of the liquid-ity supplied. Up to the end of October 1999,315 billion was allotted in each of the
monthly basic tenders, so that a total of 345
billion was outstanding in all at all times. Inthe light of the millennium change, however,the three operations in the months of Octo-ber, November and December 1999 wereeach increased to 325 billion. Compared
with the two-weekly main tenders, participa-tion in the “long-dated tranches” is lower; itaveraged only 314 bidders, 190 of them fromGermany. The latter accounted on averagefor about 60% of the allotments, i.e. slightlymore in percentage terms than in the case ofmain tenders. Basic tenders are regularly con-ducted in the form of (“US-style”) variable-rate tenders of pre-announced size, with theresult that no monetary signalling effect isexerted by the (marginal) allotment rate.
In functional terms, this basic refinancing in-
strument embodies a number of features ofthe erstwhile rediscount credit of the Bundes-bank. It is designed to appeal to credit institu-tions which are less active in the money mar-ket, and which are interested in more long-term liquidity management. Judging by ex-perience to date, however, the proportion ofsmaller institutions in Germany in longer-term refinancing operations is actually ratherlower than in the case of main tenders.Fine-tuning instruments
The operational framework of the Eurosystem
is completed by a number of fine-tuning in-struments that can be wielded quickly andflexibly, such as foreign exchange swaps orvery-short-term operations in the form of so-called “quick tenders”. Fine-tuning was em-ployed for the first time on January 5, 2000,in the shape of a quick tender (see below).The Bundesbank, too, used to be reluctant toresort to fine-tuning instruments in the past.Besides the buffer function of the minimumreserves, the swift transmission of liquidity viaultra-modern payment systems and the pro-fessionalisation of liquidity managementamong money-market players have helped tolessen the need for fine-tuning.
Payment infrastructure for the single
inter-bank money market
In the period prior to monetary union, the
structure of the money market and marketpractices were, of course, marked by nationalfeatures. However, the introduction of thesingle currency and the associated paymentinfrastructure gave a strong impetus to har-monisation and the integration of the nation-al money markets, so that it is meanwhile le-gitimate to speak of a close interlinking ofthe hitherto national money-market seg-ments.
A single money market in the euro area with
uniform interest rates and efficient cross-border liquidity equalisation is an essentialprerequisite of monetary stimuli affecting the

22banking system of the entire euro area. By in-
stituting the TARGET system for cross-borderpayments, the Eurosystem itself made amajor contribution to integrating the moneymarket.
The payment system TARGET links together
all 15 national real-time gross systems oflarge-value payments in the European Union,and thus makes possible the same-day settle-ment of cross-border payments. On the Ger-man side, the Bundesbank’s ELS gross systemhas been connected to TARGET. To ensure themaximum availability of cross-border pay-ments, TARGET closes only on the two EU-wide public holidays of Christmas Day andNew Year’s Day, and this year also on GoodFriday, Easter Monday, May Day and BoxingDay.
6The system regularly remains open for
interbank payments until 6 p.m. (and on thelast day of the reserve maintenance period,half-an-hour longer) in order to ensure thesame-day settlement of final balances frommoney-market trading and from other pay-ment systems.
Besides the gross system TARGET, a number
of Europe-wide payment systems operate ona net or hybrid basis. At the close of business,the balances of these payment systems mustbe settled via TARGET, since that is the onlysystem through which the Europe-wide trans-fer of central bank money is possible. Theinteraction of several payment systems, andabove all the movement of intra-day liquiditybetween the systems, posed difficulties in thefirst few weeks of monetary union. In particu-lar, the coexistence of net and gross paymentsystems creates something of an “incentivedilemma” for the banks engaged in pay-
ments, as a result of which delays may occurin payments, which may well have an impacton interbank money-market rates. For out-going payments, it may appear advantageousto use a liquidity-conserving net system inwhich cover does not have to be provideduntil the balances are finally offset. For in-coming payments, by contrast, a gross systemhas advantages for the recipient, since it re-sults directly, on account of the immediateexecution, in an inflow of funds, and the im-mediate finality provides security.
7In this con-
nection, a trend is evident not to deliver pay-ments until the later part of a day. As a result,some money-market activity has shifted per-ceptibly into the afternoon and towards theclose of banking business. Hence, in Januarylast year, the Eurosystem had to respond todifficulties in the interaction of the systemson several occasions by lengthening theopening hours of TARGET. In the meantime,however, these teething troubles have largelybeen overcome. The same goes for the short-comings that emerged in the first few monthsin the ESCB and among other participants.
6I.e. even in countries/banking systems in which these
are not public holidays, cross-border payments via
TARGETare not available.
7Whereas, in net systems, incoming and outgoing pay-
ments are netted prior to final execution and only the
balance is offset, in gross systems every single payment is
executed. The upshot of this is that, on the one hand,
more liquidity is tied up in gross systems; on the other
hand, if cover is available, the immediate execution and
finality of the transfer can be guaranteed. In net systems,
by contrast, there is in principle a risk that, if the final bal-
ances of one or more participants are not settled, the en-
tire settlement will have to be unwound.Interaction of

23Germany as a turntable for liquidity
The efficiency meanwhile achieved in pay-
ments seems to enable German banks to playsomething of a redistributional role betweenTARGET member countries outside and insidethe euro area. Thus, the German money mar-ket regularly receives funds in cross-borderpayments, especially from the financial centreLondon. These liquidity inflows generallyshow, as the above chart illustrates, a distinctsimultaneity to same-day outflows to mem-ber states of the monetary union. That sug-gests that the German money market acts asa turntable, redistributing liquidity betweenthe “outs” and the “ins”.
8It appears, how-
ever, that the simultaneity of inflows and out-flows may also be interrupted, especially attimes when opportunities for arbitrage arisewithin a reserve maintenance period – typic-
ally, therefore, in connection with the weeklymain tenders of the Eurosystem. Apparently,the banks succeed at such times in buildingup or running down minimum reserve bal-ances quickly by activating their cross-bordertrading.

inated money market.
Contract volumes and turnover in the uncol-
lateralised money market rose sharply in1999, as compared with the national marketsin 1998. In Germany the average volume ofindividual contracts virtually doubled. In par-ticular, cross-border transactions between themajor market players in the euro area mayrun into the billions.
Although comprehensive statistics on turn-
over in interbank money-market trading arelacking, a survey among the most active insti-tutions in the money market showed that themovement of turnover in the money marketis heavily dependent on maturities. At theshort maturities, turnover increased especiallysteeply; that in overnight money in Germany
alone by about 60%, and in the euro area byapproximately 40% (see the adjacent table).In this connection it is striking that, in thesecond half of 1999, the German EONIApanel banks progressively increased theirEONIA turnover and, virtually in parallel, theirshare in the aggregate turnover of all EONIApanel banks: in December that share wasnearly twice as high as in the first half of lastyear (see the chart on page 25). That reflectsthe growing significance of German banks inEuropean money-market liquidity adjustment.Unlike the conditions in overnight money andone-week money operations, uncollateralisedturnover in the time-deposit sector with ma-turities of one month and more has declined,in part markedly. That goes both for the entiremarket and for the German market segment.The decrease in the time-deposit sector is atleast partly due to the tendency to collateraliselonger-term money-market transactions. Incountries which previously had no minimumreserve requirements, the enhanced demandfor short-term liquidity-management oper-ations may have reinforced the rise in theshort maturities.
The increases in turnover in the very short-term
money-market segment are being accompan-ied by an increasing Europeanisation of money-market trading. The institutions surveyed nowtransact more than one-half of their businessacross national borders. An indication of thesignificance of cross-border money-markettrading is provided by the turnover in TARGET,which averages about 3350 billion a day.

In connection with the ongoing money-market
integration, national market practices are be-ginning to give way to uniform standards. Evenso, credit institutions domiciled in Germany arecontinuing to lend one another call money, i.e.“until further notice”, in interbank trading. Incross-border trading, by contrast, pure over-night credit is standard practice. The rapid inte-gration of the money market is mirrored by theswift acceptance of the new reference interestrates EONIA for overnight money and EURIBORfor time deposits. EURIBOR and EONIA arebased on a broad panel of reporting banks.

Notwithstanding the high degree of integra-
tion of the European money market, nationalmoney markets still perform some specificfunctions. For instance, a large part of inter-bank liquidity redistribution still takes placeinitially in the national market segment, withthe result that cross-border trading is not fullyactivated until afterwards. Moreover, specific-ally in Germany smaller institutions (especiallysavings banks and cooperative banks) trad-itionally act as part of their associations.Some medium-sized institutions, too, oftenhave their field of operations primarily in theregional or national sphere. The comparative-ly low participation of smaller and regionalbanks in cross-border money-market tradingtherefore reflects a kind of assignment ofroles in the German money market that isnothing new. In this context, the larger insti-tutions that are more active in the moneymarket perform the function of redistributing
central bank liquidity. They lend on suchfunds, at a certain premium, to smaller andmedium-sized banks. The premiums paid bythese smaller institutions for this service havenot (yet) changed significantly following thelaunch of monetary union, presumably be-cause – as indicated – there is no pronouncedcross-border competition in this sector.

26the repo market (where securities are sold
temporarily for money, subject to a repur-chase agreement), throughout the euro area– as the survey revealed – turnover in 1999increased over 1998 even more strongly thanin the uncollateralised money market, namelyby about one-quarter (compared with 16%in the uncollateralised market). Much as inthe case of the uncollateralised money mar-ket, money-market players in Germany reportthat the contract sizes of repos, too, havedoubled since the launch of the euro.
In monetary policy terms, repos are interest-
ing because they link the money market withthe time-deposit market, the spot securitiesmarket and the forward securities market.From the angle of banking business, repo op-erations provide an opportunity to reducecredit risk and the cost of funds. Thus, thelender can save capital charges in comparisonwith uncollateralised operations, providedthat (public sector) securities not requiringcapital backing are used. For the borrower, areduction in the cost of funds is possible onaccount of the low credit risk of the securitiesserving as collateral. The repo rate is normallybelow the rate for uncollateralised loans ofthe same maturity.
In Germany, a significant repo market did not
evolve until relatively late. Structurally, thisowes something to the universal banking sys-tem, since universal banks – unlike, say, puresecurities firms – can procure funds by meansof deposit business, and are not required tofall back on repos. The exemption of liabilitiesarising from repo operations from minimumreserve requirements in December 1996greatly stimulated repo activity on the part of
German credit institutions. An additionalboost to such activity was given by the launchof monetary union, since collateralisation isattractive in the light of risk considerationsfor operations with a fairly large range of for-eign counterparties, especially since bilaterallimits, such as are needed in the uncollateral-ised market, become superfluous. Moreover,repos are often a matter of course to foreigncounterparties because that type of transac-tion is well-established in their national mar-kets. By contrast, uncollateralised operationscontinue to predominate in money-markettrading between German counterparties.
The repo market in the euro area is less
homogeneous and less integrated than theuncollateralised money market. In part, thatis because there are two different motives forrepo operations. Operations in which thelender is intent on obtaining a particular se-curity are rather to be assigned to the capital-market side. Such repo operations for what isknown as “special collateral” depend veryheavily on its availability, and therefore attractdifferent repo rates from operations behindwhich there is no demand for specific secur-ities. In the case of so-called “general collat-eral”, the key factor for the borrower is themotive of obtaining liquidity, i.e. the money-market side of the repo operation.
Most special collaterals are not readily avail-
able everywhere in the euro area. The prob-lem of availability is exacerbated by the factthat, in the case of cross-border repos, clear-ing and settlement on the security side arenot yet working as smoothly as on the money

27side because the settlement infrastructure still
does not have the high degree of integrationof the payment infrastructure. Moreover, thestandardisation of market practices is turningout to be very much more difficult than in theuncollateralised money market – not least be-cause repo operations in the respective na-tional markets are subject to varying legaland tax requirements.
Securitised money markets and
money-market derivatives
While the unsecuritised money market is
dominated by banks, the markets for money-market paper and for derivative instrumentsdisplay distinctly mixed structures among themarket participants. Very often, non-banks(such as industrial enterprises, insurance com-
panies and especially public sector borrowers)are heavily involved in these markets. How-ever, the separate national segments showsubstantial differences, both from one an-other and with respect to their integration inthe market as a whole. Notably money-market paper is often held until maturity bythe investor, with the result that the respect-ive secondary market is often comparativelyilliquid. Moreover, as in the repo market,there are legal, technical and tax impedi-ments to integration. In Germany, comparedwith other countries, the securitisation ofshorter-term financing operations remains oflittle significance (see the above table), des-pite having increased somewhat of late.Securitised money market

28On the non-bank side, the public sector is by
far the largest issuer of short-term debt secur-ities. The six-month Bubills introduced in1996, with an outstanding total of regularly310 billion, were joined in November 1999
by Federal discount notes (Bundeskas-
senscheine – also known as “cash bills”).
These very short-term securities are used as aflexible liquidity-management instrument bythe Federal Government. The outstandingvolume of such securities is limited to 35 bil-
lion. Definite statements on the buyer struc-ture of this instrument cannot be made as yetsince so little experience is available. But it issafe to assume – as in the case of Bubills –that the interest of foreign institutional invest-ors is strong.Private enterprises’ commercial paper pro-
grammes continue to play a relatively minorrole in Germany. Given the persistently fa-vourable overall macroeconomic environ-ment, with low levels of inflation, longer-term modes of financing traditionally pre-dominate in Germany; in addition, enterpriseshave close relations with their principal (uni-versal) bankers. In future, however, the Ger-man market is likely to be stimulated by themore sophisticated foreign markets for com-mercial paper and a generally increasingtrend towards securitised lending. In the fieldof short-term bank debt securities, a distinctupturn has been discernible since the secondhalf of 1998. This may have owed somethingto the fact that the minimum reserves to beheld on outstanding paper have been earninginterest since the beginning of last year. Thismeans that the competitive disadvantage suf-fered by short-term bank debt securities (inrelation, say, to commercial paper) as a resultof the non-remuneration of the minimum re-serves has disappeared.
Rather like the collateralisation of money-
market operations, the increased use ofmoney-market derivatives is a trend which,while not caused by monetary union, waspresumably reinforced by it. Derivatives openup opportunities for arbitrage and for theflexible management of interest-rate riskswith a low capital input. Since the launch ofmonetary union, the market for derivativeshas become perceptibly deeper and more li-quid. For instance, total turnover in interest-rate swaps in the euro area has increased byover 70% (see the above table); Germanmarket participants actually report a doubling

29of their turnover. The rapid integration of this
market segment – the German banks sur-veyed transact 70% of their swaps across na-tional borders – is largely due to the rapid ac-ceptance of uniform reference interest rates,and thus to a harmonisation effected by mar-ket players themselves. As a mirror image ofthe growth of overnight money turnover inthe uncollateralised spot market, there was aconcentration on EONIA swaps in derivativestrading. The largely market-driven standard-isation of the swaps facilitated the emer-gence and use of an EMU-wide uniformswap-rate curve. Since the banks use swap-rate curves to evaluate financial instruments,the integration of the swap market is impin-ging on other segments of the financial mar-kets. The deepening of liquidity has mean-while led to a narrowing of bid/offer spreadsto one to two basis points. However, theemergence of uniform contract standards isnot yet quite concluded, which suggests thatsome saving potential in transaction costs stillexists.
In the case of exchange-traded money-
market futures, the three-month EURIBOR fu-ture has turned out to be the most liquid in-strument. At the turn of the year, twelvemonths ago, it superseded its forerunners de-nominated in national currencies, such as theeuro-DM contract.
The millennium change in the money
market
By coping with the millennium change with-
out problems on the whole, the “youthful”euro money market passed yet another test.That is the more remarkable since, for a pro-
longed period in 1999, substantial premiumswere charged for liquid funds beyond theend of the year. This is reflected in the differ-ential between rates for time deposits andmoney-market-swap rates (see the abovechart). Since in the case of swaps, unlike timedeposits, a loan amount is not transferred,but only “marginal balances settled”, the in-crease in the interest-rate differential beyondthe “normal” level unaffected by the millen-nium change probably constitutes quite aclose approximation to the premiums paid forliquid funds around the turn of the millen-nium. Such premiums always materialised inthe maturities which included the millenniumchange, and reached their peak in October/November 1999. At that time, the “fear-of-the-millennium premium” aroused expect-

30ations – at least in arithmetical terms – of
double-digit interest rates for overnightmoney beyond the turn of the millennium. Insubsequent weeks, however, the premiumsdeclined, apparently because the risks wererated ever-lower. Even so, before Christmas,rates of 5% to 6% were still being expectedfor overnight money beyond the end of theyear. In point of fact, the EONIA rate over theturn of the year, at 3.75%, actually remainedbelow the marginal lending rate of the Euro-system. And as early as the first trading day inthe year 2000, money-market rates largely re-turned to normal again.
The Eurosystem had pointed out at an early
date that the available monetary policy oper-ational framework would enable the millen-nium change to be coped with without majorproblems and, in particular, would permit asmooth transition in terms of liquidity.
10Year
2000 compliance was checked in a (further)key area by means of extensive tests of theTARGET system.
11Such compliance was also
borne out by reality: the payment systems inthe euro area worked without disruptionafter the millennium change. In line with thispicture, the increase in currency in circulationin the euro area in December was only about3 percentage points above the rise observedin the preceding year. Both among the publicat large and among the banks, cash was heldas a precaution prior to the millenniumchange only on a limited scale.
By sharply increasing the final main tender ex-
tending beyond the turn of the millennium,the Eurosystem ensured that the supply of li-quidity at the beginning of the year 2000 wasabundant. That was actually accentuated at
the end of the year by the banks resorting tothe marginal lending facility ( 311.4 billion
from December 30 to January 2, accompan-ied by recourse to the deposit facility amount-ing to 32.6 billion). That primarily reflected a
preference which the banks had expressedearly on – citing risk considerations – for li-quidity equalisation at the end of the yearfrom the central bank direct. This goes par-ticularly for German credit institutions, whichaccounted for the greater part of the re-course to the standing facilities at the end oflast year. The excessive liquidity (as measuredby “normal” conditions) was increased stillfurther in the first few days of January bychanges in some market-related liquidity fac-tors. Against this background, the Eurosys-tem offered the banks time deposits on Janu-ary 5 by means of a “US-style” variable-ratequick tender in order to mop up “excess”liquidity from the money market. One of thereasons why this very first fine-tuning meas-ure by the Eurosystem was necessary wasthat it was not possible to effect the usual ad-justment of liquidity by means of main ten-ders after it was decided as early as Septem-ber last year not to conduct a main refinan-cing operation during the first week of theyear 2000 in order to free a period that wasdeemed to be critical from transactions.

31After the advance notice of the quick tender
of January 4 (running from January 5 to 12),specifying a maximum bidding-rate of 3%and an absorption total of about 335 billion
(approximately one-half as large as a maintender), the overnight money rate, which hadpreviously fallen below the main tender rate(of 3%), rose again above that level. Overall,the fine-tuning counterparties showed littleinterest in the quick tender: just over 314 bil-
lion was bid (and allotted); the marginal andlikewise the weighted average allotment ratewas around 3%. German banks showedgreat restraint in bidding for that quick ten-der, since they had already cut back theirfund-raising through main and basic tenderstowards the end of 1999 and, instead, had
opted for shorter-term borrowing in the inter-bank market and, as mentioned, through thestanding facilities. Owing to this more preciseprocurement of liquidity they – unlike thebanking system in the remainder of the euroarea – had no liquidity overhang after theturn of the year. In view of the excess liquidityremaining overall after the quick tender, theEONIA rate initially fell again to 2.9%. It wasnot until the reduction of the subsequent firstmain tender of the present year (dated Janu-ary 12), compared with the expiring oper-ation of this kind, by 357 billion, to a total of
335 billion, that the banking system’s liquid-
ity supply finally returned to normal.

33The relationship
between banklending and thebond market inGermanyLending relationships in Germany are
characterised by three features: banklending occupies a pre-eminent pos-ition, the significance of corporatebonds is still virtually negligible, andbank debt securities are used intensive-ly to refinance loans. The present art-icle studies the reasons for these struc-tures and retraces important lines ofdevelopment. On the whole, it can besaid that the intermediation of banksin lending business with domestic en-terprises has so far been rooted in spe-cific advantages regarding credit as-sessment and monitoring. In depositbusiness, however, the bank functionsassociated with the classic depositforms have been eclipsed by high-yielding, highly liquid securitisedassets. For the future, it is to be expect-ed that, owing to the plummetingcosts of information and transactionsand to the fact that the demand forsecuritised products will tend to con-tinue to grow, for enterprises the rais-ing of funds via the bond market willlikewise gradually gain in importanceat the expense of bank loans.
The significance of credit financing for
the macro economy
In Germany, taking up loans constitutes by
far the most important method of raisingcapital “from without”. Loans, which aremainly granted by banks and, to a lesser ex-tent, by other financial intermediaries such as

1998.
1Lending by foreign banks to Germany
is not included here. For financial and non-financial enterprises, for instance, own funds inthe form of equity, totalling 31.3 trillion, con-
trasted with securitised and non-securitiseddebt amounting to 33.2 trillion.
Regarding the structure of credit financing,
securitised borrowing via the issuance ofshorter-dated and long-dated debt securitiesand loans from banks have a similar signifi-cance in the macro economy. By the end of1998 bank lending had gone up to around32.6 trillion, as opposed to 32.0 trillion
worth of bonds and money market paperoutstanding (see table on this page). This hasbeen fed, particularly in the nineties, by a
rapid recovery of securitised lending; at theend of 1990, only 30.7 trillion worth of such
lending was outstanding, or around half thevolume of bank loans ( 31.4 trillion).
However, there are major sectoral differences
in the structure of indebtedness. The extremeends of the scale are formed by households(excluding the housing sector) and the publicsector. Households raise external funds –mainly to finance consumption – exclusivelyin the form of loans, with bank loans makingup nearly 94% as at the end of 1998, andloans extended by insurance companies ac-counting for another 5%. The pattern is simi-lar in the housing sector, with bank lendingmaking up 82% of overall liabilities and loansfrom building and loan associations and in-surance companies accounting for 10% and6% of debt, respectively. The public sector isthe only sector in which, at the end of 1998,bonded debt (at 59% of overall liabilities) ac-counted for a larger share than funds bor-rowed from banks (37%). In the financialsectors, deposits, accounting for 74% of allliabilities, remain the most important form ofexternal capital, ahead of bank debt secur-ities, which account for just under 21%.However, bank debt securities have gainedground since 1990, when that ratio was81% to 18%. Bonds play only a minor role inthe financing of producing enterprises fromexternal sources; at the end of 1998 only 2%of liabilities were accounted for by bonds andmoney market paper.

This contrasted with bank loans, at 42%,loans by insurance companies, at 4%, andother borrowing in Germany and abroad, at29%. The last item also includes the proceedsfrom bonds issued through foreign financialsubsidiaries, totalling an estimated 331 billion
or so, or 1
34% of overall liabilities.
Compared with other industrial countries, par-
ticularly the Anglo-Saxon countries, there aretwo structural features of indebtedness in Ger-many that stand out. One is that bonds andmoney market paper play a relatively insignifi-cant role in corporate financing, and the otheris that bank debt securities are used intensivelyto refinance lending, which leads, on balance,to indirect borrowing on the capital marketswith intermediation by banks. Enterprises’ se-curitised debt (including funds raised via for-eign financial subsidiaries) came to about 3%of gross domestic product in Germany in mid-1999, compared with 34% in the UnitedStates (see table on this page). Conversely, theshare of bank debt securities in bank lending inGermany, at 33%, was several times the com-p a r a b l ef i g u r ef o rt h eU S( 5 % ) .T h es e c u r i t i s a -tion of public sector debt, however, has beenat a level similar to that in other industrialcountries. This raises the question as to why,for one thing, industrial bonds have hardlybeen able to establish a foothold as substitutesfor bank loans in Germany, and for another,why to a large extent bank debt securities areemployed to complement bank lending. Bothaspects will be examined more closely in thesections below.The issuance of bonds as an alternative to
borrowing from banks
Borrowers can generally choose between ei-
ther borrowing the funds they need frombanks or obtaining them direct from the cap-ital market by issuing debt securities. Themain factor in choosing a form of financingis, in the end, the question of what is morecost-effective on the whole: obtaining fundsdirect from the market or having a credit in-stitution as an intermediary. In the theoreticalevent of perfect markets, which are charac-terised in particular by the absence of eithertransaction costs or information differentialsbetween creditors and debtors, all credit rela-tions can be executed smoothly via the capitalmarket.

36from banks shows, conversely, that imperfect
markets – characterised by such things as in-stitutionally related transaction costs or asym-metric information – play a major role in reallife. Ultimately the depth to which lendingbusiness is rooted in banks hinges on the ex-tent of such imperfections.
Against this background, administrative bar-
riers (which are to be regarded as transactioncosts in the broadest sense) are one explan-ation for the traditionally negligible significanceof domestic industrial bonds. In particular, theissue authorisation procedure, required by lawuntil the end of 1990, made it difficult to issuedebt securities. This was joined by a stampduty (also in force until 1990) of 0.25% of themarket price, which hampered bond trading.To circumvent these disadvantages, Germanenterprises issued debt securities mostlythrough foreign financial subsidiaries. At thesame time this also makes tax advantages pos-sible via the trade earnings tax. When calculat-ing this tax, 50% of interest on permanentdebt (with a maturity of more than one year) isincluded in the assessment basis, whereasinterest on short-term loans is tax-free. In prin-ciple, this burden can be avoided by having anenterprise finance itself over the long term onthe market via a foreign financial subsidiary,which would then extend a short-term loan tothe parent company in Germany.
However, these tax considerations do not ex-
plain the “bank-heavy” credit structure, sinceinterest on bank loans, like coupon payments,is subject to the trade earnings tax. Thestamp duty and the issue authorisation pro-cedure, though, were burdens that only af-fected securities. Apparently, their signifi-
cance should not be overrated, since the vol-ume of domestic corporate bonds and com-mercial paper outstanding has still remainedlow even after the removal of those hurdles(see chart on page 37). Issuing activity amongforeign financing companies did not pick upuntil 1997, and only in 1999 did such activityincrease in Germany. The important deter-minants of German enterprises’ borrowingbehaviour are therefore not to be found somuch in financial market regulations as in-stead in the corporate sector itself, namely itssize structure and variety of legal forms.
German industry has been traditionally char-
acterised by medium-sized enterprises. In1997 nearly two-thirds of all turnover subjectto value-added tax was accounted for by en-terprises with an annual turnover of less thanDM 500 million (see table on page 38). Forsmall and medium-sized firms, cost factorsalone are enough to put limits on opportun-ities for direct capital market financing. As re-gards bond-based financing, besides ongoinginterest payments, costs are generated mostlyindependently of the amount of funds raised,and these costs can be considerably high,particularly when a bond is launched. They in-clude underwriting and broker fees chargedby the consortium, the stock market listingfee, and publication costs. The costs of issu-ing listed corporate bonds can reach as highas several percentage points of the facevalue. These costs are joined by ongoingancillary costs for coupon payments and forthe trustee. The high overhead costs of anissue alone mean that issuing listed bonds isonly an option if large volumes are to be is-

37sued. Issue amounts of less than DM 50 mil-
lion have therefore for a long time been theexception. Only recently have a number ofsmaller issues been placed; however, theywere often not “classical” bonds but insteadissued as convertible bonds.
The interaction of enterprise size and legal
form, and the concomitant information anddisclosure practices, have tended to be agreater hindrance to the issuance of corpor-ate bonds. This can be attributed to theasymmetry of information between debtorsand (potential) lenders: since the lender – re-gardless of whether this involves bank lend-ing or bonds – bears a default risk but doesnot participate in the profits, debtors may betempted to provide misleading informationon risks and profitability, and then turnaround and actually carry out more high-riskprojects which would yield large profits if suc-cessful. Thus, if the lender has incomplete in-formation, this could lead to adverse selec-tion. There is also the danger of moral hazard,should the creditors not be able to monitorthe use of the credit granted or the profitgained by the project. In that case, fundsmight, without anyone knowing it, be divert-ed to uses that are not in the interest of thelender.
A careful credit assessment may reduce ad-
verse selection problems, and monitoringmay have the same effect on moral hazard.However, they entail examination and moni-toring costs which may at times be consider-able, and which would also have to be borneseparately by each bondholder if the projectwere funded directly from the capital market.Borrowing on the capital market therefore
presupposes the availability of sufficient infor-mation for a credit assessment and for moni-toring, and hinges on the existence of an in-centive to employ funds for credit assess-ments and monitoring. As regards the avail-ability of information, tapping the capitalmarket is a viable option especially for thoseenterprises which are either subject to far-reaching disclosure requirements anyway orhave a good reputation as borrowers. This re-quirement is met, in particular, by listed publiclimited companies, which are not only re-quired by the Companies Act to publish re-ports but are also required by securities regu-lators to disclose certain facts. Seen in thislight, the dominance of bank lending goeshand in hand with the fact that for a longtime equity financing in Germany played only

38a minor role.2Enterprises having other legal
forms must also comply with certain publica-tion requirements, yet those requirements arenot as extensive as those governing listed en-terprises. In addition, German accountingregulations are tailored to continuity in valu-ation but not to ongoing credit assessmentby the capital market.
The virtual impossibility, in practice, of
changing the terms of contracts following anissue is a factor that also contributes to driv-ing up the information costs of bond-basedfinancing. By contrast, loan agreements withbanks afford the opportunity of flexible con-tract adjustments over time. In the event ofoccasional liquidity shortfalls, it is much easierto obtain a payment deferral or a bridgingloan from a bank than from the (scattered)bond creditors. This, however, is dependent
on the existence of a long-term relationshipbetween the credit institution and the enter-prise, in which the bank would be able tocover the additional costs of such a follow-upnegotiation with increased profits from futuretransactions with the customer. Such arelationship can be achieved either bycontract (such as a long-dated loan) or if a“house bank” can specially attest to theborrower’s creditworthiness. House bankingrelationships are a characteristic feature ofthe German financial system. According to asurvey,

39firms surveyed have one banking connection
only. Three-quarters of overall indebtednessto credit institutions, on average, is con-centrated on that enterprise’s “house bank”.
Asymmetric information tends to decrease in
inverse proportion to the size of theenterprise. For one thing, major firms, andlisted public limited companies in particular,are subject to stricter publication requirementswhich make it possible to look into the stateof their finances. For another thing, the costsof a credit assessment are largely independentof the enterprise’s size, which means such as-sessments have a greater impact, in relativeterms, on smaller companies. Thus, both thesize structure and the legal form place limitson the scope for capital market-based finan-cing. Against this background, it is no surprisethat the significance of bank loans as a sourceof financing declines as the size of enterprisesincreases (see adjacent chart). For small enter-prises having an annual turnover of less thanDM 25 million, the share of bank loans inliabilities ranged between 33% and 40% in1996. However, for companies having an an-nual turnover of at least DM 100 million, lessthan 10% of liabilities were accounted for bybank loans. Over time, this disparity haswidened. Whereas bank loans taken up bymajor companies, which started at a low level,have tended to decline further in importance,the dependence of smaller enterprises onbank loans has even gone up.
However, the lower level of recourse to bank
loans by major firms has not benefited themarket for corporate bonds to the sameextent. A genuine substitution of bank lend-ing by bonds has only been observed up to
now among the largest, internationally oper-ating public limited companies, in particular;two-thirds of the companies listed on theGerman Stock Index, or DAX (excludingbanks and insurance companies), and sevenout of eight German industrial enterprises list-ed in the EURO STOXX 50 index have issuedcorporate bonds direct or via foreign financialsubsidiaries.

40terprises’ most important source of external
funds is pension provisions, which make upsome 15% of the liabilities of enterpriseshaving an annual turnover of at least DM 100million.
Another reason why bond-based financing is
of subordinate importance to German enter-prises is the fact that the presence of institu-tional investors in Germany has tended to beminor (see table above). Institutional investorsare important to the development of capitalmarkets for two reasons: they are potentialsecurities purchasers, and they contribute toevening out the aforementioned informationdifferentials. The size of their portfoliosmakes it profitable for specialised playerssuch as investment funds or pension funds toinvest in the procurement and evaluation ofinformation. A broad base of professional
players is an important institutional prerequis-ite for an effective credit assessment andmonitoring via the capital market (see alsothe box on “Banks and rating agencies”). Areason why the significance of institutional in-vestors is only minor is to be found especiallyin the legal and economic policy framework,particularly the system of largely unfundedpensions or of provisions set aside by enter-prises for pensions. This is why pensionfunds, which are one of the most importantgroups of institutional investors at the inter-national level, have up to now not played arole here in Germany.
Refinancing of loans using bank debt se-
curities
When funds are procured in a securitised
fashion by issuing bank debt securities, bothlending and securitised liabilities remain onthe bank’s balance sheet. This “on-balance-sheet securitisation” differs fundamentallyfrom the “securitisation” of assets in the nar-rower sense, where bank lending is removedfrom the bank’s balance sheet through securi-tisation (see also the box on “Mortgagebonds and asset-backed securities” onpage 42). As at the end of November 1999the nominal value of debt securities in circula-tion issued by domestic credit institutions wasaround 31.3 trillion. This was accounted for
almost exclusively by capital market paper,whereas money market paper (having a ma-turity of up to one year) only accounted for

41360 billion.4Thus, bank debt instruments
make up nearly two-thirds of the entire out-standing volume of domestic bonds. In termsof the total amount of lending to non-banks(including lending against securities), the vol-ume of bank debt securities in circulation hasnow reached a level of around 40%. In thenineties, this ratio rose by some ten percent-age points, whereas in the eighties that figurehad hovered at around 30% for a long time(see chart on page 44).
Mortgage bonds (Pfandbriefe) , “backed” by
certain assets, form the centrepiece of theGerman market for bank debt securities.Hypothekenpfandbriefe , which serve to fi-
nance private investment over the long termand which are backed by loans secured bymortgages, have traditionally occupied aprominent position. Inversely, public mort-gage bonds (Öffentliche Pfandbriefe , former-
ly known as Kommunalobligationen ) are used
to refinance loans to government agencies;they are “backed” by loans to the public sec-tor. Mortgage bonds are issued by mortgagebanks (private mortgage banks and publicmortgage banks) and, in the case of “Öffent-
liche Pfandbriefe” , also by the Land banks.
Within the Pfandbrief segment the focus has
shifted distinctly towards Öffentliche Pfand-
briefe , in line with rising public sector indebt-
edness (see chart on page 43). Whereas atthe beginning of the seventies Hypotheken-
pfandbriefe represented as much as aroundBanks and rating agencies:
Two solutions to the problemof delegation
Credit assessments and regular monitoring
generate costs which, in the event of directlending relations, would have to be borneby each individual investor or lender. Thiswould cause costs to accumulate and pro-vides an incentive for “free riders” to usethese services. By transferring assessmentand monitoring functions to a specially des-ignated institution, these negative effectscan be limited. Two different institutionalsolutions have prevailed, each of which istailored to a specific financial structure. In“banking-based” systems, this solution islending via intermediaries which collectsavings and provide them as loans. In“capital-market-oriented” systems, ratingagencies have traditionally assumed thefunction of credit assessment and monitor-ing and forward this information to themarket players.
Efficient monitoring, however, presupposes
the ability to effectively “monitor themonitor”. Banks which are “delegatedmonitors” have two incentives to monitorcreditworthiness carefully. Firstly, thesebanks are liable to the extent of their owncapital if the borrower defaults. Secondly,the earnings trends in loan business allowoutsiders to draw conclusions on the qual-ity of credit assessments and monitoring.Besides that, in practice there is always thethreat of prudential regulators imposingsanctions. If they were lax in their monitor-ing, rating agencies would quickly squan-der their reputations as independent critics.The result would be that borrowers wouldno longer be prepared to pay for a ratingthat is no longer taken seriously by themarket and which is therefore worthless.Hence, internal credit assessments by banksand external ratings both contain mechan-isms that counteract errors in the assess-ment of the borrowers’ creditworthiness.

the same period, also starting at 40%, toaround one-half ( 3663 billion as at the end
of November 1999).
Unsecured bank debt securities have made
considerable gains in significance since thebeginning of the nineties. They include secur-ities issued by specialised credit institutions(such as the Reconstruction Loan Corpor-ation) and all other paper statistically record-ed as “other bank debt securities”. The vol-ume of debt securities issued by specialisedcredit institutions, at 3161 billion as at the
end of November 1999, accounted for slight-ly more than 10% of all bank bonds in circu-lation. At the beginning of the nineties, in thewake of the consolidation of the east Germanbanking system, this percentage had at timesgone up to around 20%. Until recently, thesale of other bank debt securities, used exten-sively particularly by commercial banks to refi-nance their general lending business, rosesharply. The outstanding volume was 3367
billion as at the end of November 1999; theirshare in the overall volume of bank debt se-curities in circulation was thus somewhatmore than 25%.

asset-backed securities (ABS):Two ways of securitising assets
Mortgage bonds and ABS are “asset-
backed” types of bonds. Whereas for mort-gage bonds both the group of issuers andthe lien on property or communal loanswhich are eligible as collateral are clearlydefined by law, ABS transactions can, inprinciple, be executed by all institutionshaving sufficiently similar and thus “com-binable” loan portfolios. Besides classicABS, which securitise consumer lending,and mortgage backed securities (MBS),based on mortgages, there is now a seriesof “second-generation” ABS, such as collat-eralised loan obligations (CLOs), which arebacked by corporate loans.
The key economic difference between
mortgage bonds and ABS lies in the treat-ment of credit risks. In an ABS transaction,the first lending institution sells loans to aspecial-purpose firm which refinances itselfby issuing ABS. The credit risks are thuspassed on to the purchasers of ABS. As formortgage bonds, however, the loans andliabilities remain on the bank’s balancesheet. The credit risk for the purchaser ofmortgage bonds depends, first of all, onthe creditworthiness of the issuing bank;on top of that, it depends on the quality ofthe cover of the mortgage bond.
In terms of their credit quality, mortgage
bonds are first-class paper; moreover, theemergence of the market for “Jumbo Mort-gage Bonds” has increased liquidity in thismarket segment by a wide margin. By con-trast, ABS, in terms of both their creditquality and the design of the bond, cover awider spectrum. They constitute a form ofrefinancing for those institutions in particu-lar which cannot issue mortgage bonds orwhich seek to offer certain investors tailor-made products.

regional or local public authorities) but alsoadvantages in overcoming asymmetric infor-mation (for enterprises) favour the intermedi-ation of banks in borrowing, the questionarises as to why credit institutions choose torefinance themselves in a securitised fashion.This is all the more surprising as the raising offunds in the capital market is generally moreexpensive than collecting deposits having theappropriate maturities.
A reduced rate of interest on deposits com-
pared with marketable instruments can fun-damentally be viewed as a “fee” for bank-specific services such as the implied “protec-tion” against price fluctuations (for long-termdeposits) and default risk (through deposit in-surance), for the possibility of using paymentservices (for sight deposits), or for the admin-istrative expenses of account-keeping. Thisdiscount may also be a result of the existenceof little competitive pressure, allowing banksto reduce their deposit rates to a level belowthe capital market rate. The increased re-course to bank debt securities, seen fromthis perspective, can also be attributed tochanged customer preferences or to stiffercompetition in the financial sector. On thewhole, both factors have probably contrib-uted to bank debt securities rapidly gaining inimportance.
The sharp rise in financial assets in Germany
has been accompanied by a decline, in rela-tive terms, in the demand for “classic” inter-mediary banking services in deposit business.The profitability of investment seems to havebecome more and more important, at the ex-pense of, for instance, price security and the
constant availability of funds for paymentpurposes. At all events, the share of assetssubject to price risk (equities, bonds and in-vestment fund certificates) in households’ fi-nancial assets doubled over the period be-tween the beginning of the eighties and theend of 1998, from 16% to 32%. At thesame time the assets held by domestic andforeign institutional investors rose sharply. At

44the end of 1998 over 70% of the bank debt
securities held in safe custody by domesticcredit institutions for their customers belong-ed to domestic and foreign institutional in-vestors, compared with 50% as at the end ofthe eighties. The growing demand for mar-ketable products has also been reflected inthe structure of bank debt securities. Sincethe mid-nineties the credit institutions havesuccessfully undertaken a number of steps –such as, in particular, establishing “Jumbo
Mortgage Bonds” – to improve the liquidityof their bonds and thus also these bonds’chances of being accepted by their institu-tional customers.
5
The more yield-oriented behaviour of invest-ors has gone hand in hand with a further in-tensification of the already quite heated com-petition in deposit business. This trend hasbeen reflected particularly in the relative risein interest paid by German credit institutions.Whereas interest paid and interest received,in relation to the business volume during theinterest rate cycle, normally used to changeto an equal extent up to the beginning of thenineties, since the mid-nineties, when theinterest rate level has also been falling, inter-est paid has gone down distinctly less thaninterest received. That means that in 1998net interest received, at 1.37% of the busi-ness volume, hit a new all-time low. To thatextent, the increasing securitisation of theliabilities side of bank balance sheets can beconstrued as a process driven to a large de-gree by a structural shift in demand.
Trends in the volume of deposits and lending
relative to the circulation of bank debt secur-ities likewise support this assessment (seeadjacent chart). Since the beginning of thenineties securitised liabilities have grownmuch faster than lending and deposits. Ap-parently the issuing of bank debt securitieshas been influenced not just by the extensionof lending but also by the substitution of de-quarterly

45posits. The securitisation of the liabilities side
has been boosted by the downward trend incapital market rates, to be sure, yet all thesame it has exceeded the trend which wasobserved in the preceding interest rate cycle.
The securitisation of deposit business has been
supported by supply-side factors too, however.One of these factors is the mounting publicsector debt, which – particularly at the levelof the Länder and local governments – hasgenerated considerable potential for issuinglarge-volume public mortgage bonds. In add-ition, the aforementioned abolishment of theissue authorisation procedure at the end of1990 has facilitated the issuing, in particular,of unsecured other bank debt securities.Since then, that market segment has seen arapid upswing. The volume of other bankdebt securities in circulation has witnessed anannual rise of 12
12% since 1991 – an in-
crease surpassed only by public mortgagebonds (15%). Besides, short-dated bank debtsecurities (having a maturity of less than twoyears) and certificates of deposit were, untilthe end of 1998, at a disadvantage owing tothe fact that non-interest-bearing minimumreserves had to be held. Since the beginningof 1999 short-dated bank debt securities,too, have seen explosive growth; the volumeof such debt securities in circulation tripledbetween January and November 1999, reach-ing a value of 360 billion.
Outlook
Up to now the German financial system has
been characterised by the way bank lendingand the bond market complement one an-
other through the issuing of bank debt secur-ities. This makes it a mixture between a purely“capital-market-oriented” system and a“bank-based” system. In view of future de-velopments, a further increase in the yieldsensitivity of investors, seen in itself, wouldprovide a further impetus to the securitisationof liabilities-side business and would furtheraccentuate the mixed nature. If enterprises’borrowing preferences were at the same timeto shift to the bond market, this would entaila disintermediation of traditional lendingbusiness, at the very least.
The driving forces behind the disproportion-
ately large increase in the securitisation ofliabilities-side business in the nineties – in-creasing yield sensitivity and propensity of in-vestors to run risks, and, at the same time,the greater concentration of assets in thehands of institutional investors – are likely tobecome even more significant in future. Theincreasing emphasis on funded pensions,which is beginning to show up in a rudimen-tary fashion, is likely to provide an additionalimpetus to the demand for marketable finan-cial instruments.

rent debate on the creation of a legal basisfor company pension funds should also bementioned.

46companies, investment funds and pension
funds in the euro area, worth 33.7 trillion at
the end of 1996, amounted to nearly fourtimes the value of the portfolios of Germaninstitutional investors (see table on page 40).The elimination of exchange-rate risks for in-vestments within the euro area has facilitatedthe cross-border diversification of securitiesportfolios. This is all the more the case as theexisting regulations on currency-matched in-vestment (generally for 80% of the assets)that govern institutional investors in manyeuro area countries – especially insurancecompanies – now permit to a great extentcross-border investment within the borders ofmonetary union. This has contributed to ajump in net purchases of bank debt securitiesby non-residents: at 355 billion over the first
nine months of 1999, they exceeded the en-tire value of the previous year ( 337 billion) by
over one-half and were more than twice thefigure for 1997 ( 323 billion).
The irrevocable fixing of exchange rates
pushed other investment criteria, such ascredit quality and liquidity, to the forefront. Itis therefore to be suspected that there isgrowing interest not only in securities issuedby banks but also in corporate bonds. Institu-tional investors are likely to be interested, inparticular, in the fact that debt instruments is-sued by enterprises from various sectorsmake it possible to diversify one’s portfoliomore broadly across categories of credit riskthan is the case for bank bonds, which gener-ally have a high credit rating. However, theliquidity of the individual securities, too, is ofgreat importance especially to institutional in-vestors. To that extent, the possibility of“combining” certain loans to form large-vol-
ume, liquid bond issues is likely to put thebanks, as issuers, at a competitive advantageover non-financial enterprises in the longerterm, too.
On the whole, bank intermediation seems to
be primarily based on “assets-side business”,i.e. focusing on enterprises’ financing behav-iour and not so much on investors’ needs.Developments which will reduce asymmetryof information and lot-size effects, two par-ticular impediments to enterprises raisingfunds direct in the capital market, are likely tobe the main factor behind the future momen-tum of disintermediation in the Germanfinancial system. Technological progress indata processing and telecommunications areworking to reduce the effects of both impedi-ments. For example, electronic media couldbe used to provide information on an enter-prise in a timely, simple manner virtually forfree to a broad segment of the generalpublic. In addition, the possibility of usingmodern communications systems to placesecurities direct and trade them over-the-counter is likely to reduce the “critical mass”for bond issues and to cause the importanceof lot-size arguments to diminish.
To the extent that this process will cause com-
petition in lending business to increase fur-ther and profit margins to shrink, especiallythe banks themselves will probably continueto expand their services in the investmentbanking sector at the expense of traditionallending business. It is also to be expected thatthe new prudential supervisory standardsfor assessing credit risk which are being pre-

ing. It remains to be seen whether this willpromote tendencies towards disintermedi-ation, though, and to what extent this willhappen.
With the “technological” hurdles becoming
lower and lower, the subjective willingness ofa firm’s management to disclose informationcould begin to supersede the objective costsof taking recourse to the capital market asthe key factor in deciding an enterprise’s abil-ity to tap the capital market. The ownershipand financing structures that for many firmshave been fixed for quite a long time,though, tend to speak against a dramaticchange. However, economic policy measures,such as changes in tax law or also steps to-wards deregulation, could accelerate the pro-cess of change in corporate and financialstructures. The liberalisation of the Germantelecommunications market may serve as anexample; it led to a wave of restructuring andtakeovers. In connection with such activities,some of the largest corporate bond issues in
German history were launched in 1999.
On balance, there are many indications that the
substitution of bank loans by corporate bondsis increasingly superseding the complementaryuse of bank loans and bank debt securities. Themomentum and force of such an underlyingt r e n ds e e mt ob ei n f l u e n c e dt oal a r g ed e g r e eby technological advances, the pace of struc-tural change in the real sector of the economyand economic policy reforms, such as in tax lawor old-age provision. Additional impetus isbeing provided by European monetary union.The complex network of economic, legal andcultural factors which ultimately characterisesfinancial structures, though, tends to favour agradual change, in macroeconomic terms.Thus, in the German financial system the func-tions and significance of banks are not very like-ly to diminish rapidly; what is more likely is thatthe variety of financing forms will increase andthat intermediary services will continue to be-come more diversified.

49Longer-term trend
in German creditinstitutions’ inter-bank operationsInterbank operations are given much
less attention in the monetary policydebate than credit institutions’ lendingand deposit transactions with non-banks. Nevertheless, interbank oper-ations are also important for monetarypolicy. Interbank operations serve toadjust liquidity within the banking sec-tor in the short and longer term andlink the operations among the individ-ual institutions and among the variousbanking categories. In doing so, theymake transactions with non-banks eas-ier and they support the transmissionof monetary policy stimuli to the realeconomy. At the same time, they helpto spread bank-specific risks within thebanking sector. To that extent, the op-erations between the credit institu-tions are a major determinant of theefficient fulfilment of the banks’macroeconomic functions. However, ahigh degree of interdependence in thebanking community can also increasecontagion and systemic risks. In thisarticle the longer-term trend in inter-bank operations in Germany will beanalysed in detail although moneymarket activities will be largely ig-nored. Particular attention will be paidto the relative significance and struc-ture of interbank operations, financialoperations within the same bankingsectors and operations with banksabroad.

50Major results and trends
The basic conditions for German credit institu-
tions and interbank operations have changeddiscernibly since the beginning of the nineties.The merger of the banking systems in easternand western Germany in 1990 provided astrong boost to interbank operations for atime. The integration process of the bankingsystems in the European Union (EU) has ad-vanced further. The interpenetration of thebanking markets was encouraged by the singlemarket regulations, which made cross-borderfinancial transactions and the supply of bank-ing services even easier (European passport,mutual recognition of the supervision per-formed by the authorities responsible in thehome country), and more recently by the startof stage three of European economic andmonetary union. The following analysis out-lines the trends in interbank operations in thenineties; to cover longer-term developments,however, reference was also made in somecases to earlier periods.
1
Between 1990 and October 1999 the Ger-man institutions increased their mutual loansand advances not evidenced by certificates(advances) and unsecuritised borrowing (de-posits)
2from an annual average of approxi-
mately DM 900 billion to just over DM 1,910billion
3, which means that these transactions
more than doubled (+ 112%). Thus, inter-bank claims rose somewhat more slowly thanthe total business volume (+ 125%) but fast-er than the advances to German non-banks(106%). Over the longer term (since 1970)the ratio of German unsecuritised interbankassets and liabilities to total business volumehas remained virtually unchanged at just
under 18% – with the exception of the tem-porary bulge at the beginning of the nineties(see the table on page 57). This means thatthe relative importance of liquidity adjust-ment among the German institutions has notchanged. At the same time, however, thebreakdown of German interbank operationshas shifted more towards the longer matur-ities of more than one year. The proportion oftransactions with these maturities to totalbusiness volume increased by some 2 per-centage points to 11
12% during the nineties.
The borrower and lender positions of the vari-
ous categories of banks in the interbank mar-ket, which are primarily determined by theirtypical operational fields and the structureof their business with non-banks, remainedlargely unchanged in the nineties. The mostimportant “lender” institutions were the bankswith special functions
4, the mortgage banks
and the Land banks (regional giro institutions)while on the “borrower” side there were(in descending order of magnitude) the savingsbanks, the regional banks, the regional institu-tions of credit cooperatives, the big banks andthe branches of foreign institutions. The sav-ings banks have had the largest liability over-hang, in absolute terms, through Germaninterbank operations since 1995.

51In the savings bank and credit cooperative
sectors the financial operations between theinstitutions of the primary level and the cen-tral institutions are characterised principallyby liquidity adjustment and maturity trans-formation. The savings banks and credit co-operatives lend mostly short-term funds tothe central institutions whereas the latter, bycontrast, return mainly longer-term depositsto the primary institutions.
During the past few years the interbank oper-
ations with institutions abroad have seen anet growth in liabilities both in the case ofthe German institutions and in the case oftheir branches and subsidiary banks abroad.This is in line with the trend in Germany’s netexternal assets position, which has been de-clining since the beginning of the nineties. Bycontrast, the banks’ net external assets and
the German net external position had risensharply in the eighties.
Monetary policy and prudential aspects
Interbank operations serve to balance out
liquidity and to spread and transform riskswithin the banking sector. They are an im-portant instrument for the longer-term man-agement of the assets and liabilities on bankbalance sheets, which aims at cancelling outthe imbalances arising at the individual banksfrom business with non-banks. From a mon-etary policy point of view short-term claimson other banks represent a “secondary”source of liquidity, which, as far as the individ-ual banks are concerned, may be regarded asas a percentage of total business volume, annual averages

52a substitute for primary liquidity in the form
of central bank balances. Even though theinterbank liability positions on the moneymarket will eventually net out, at least in thecase of domestic operations, the money mar-ket may well have an effect on the liquidity ofthe banking sector and its ability to createmoney. Firstly, the money market makes itpossible to use the central bank funds held bythe entire banking system more efficiently.Secondly, excess balances tend to be chan-nelled into more profitable uses in the lendingand deposit business with non-banks.
5
Interbank operations likewise deserve atten-tion for their prudential importance. A highdegree of interdependence in the bankingsector generally increases the contagion andsystemic risks through domino effects andcorresponding chain reactions. Furthermore, arun on those institutions that are significantplayers on the interbank market can be poten-tially more dangerous for financial market sta-bility than a “non-bank run”.
6Owing to the
lack of a deposit guarantee scheme for inter-bank funds, there is no creditor protectionhere other than the usual means of recourseunder civil law, unless the loans have been se-cured through repurchase agreements. On anaverage of the first 11 months of 1999 inter-bank liabilities arising from repurchase agree-ments with German institutions amounted toapproximately DM 66 billion while those withinstitutions abroad came to DM 97 billion. Thelatter agreements have been increasing signifi-cantly more sharply since January 1999.
7The
fairly stable ratio between German interbankvolumes and the total business volume sug-gests that the systemic risk in interbank oper-ations – if considered separately – has changed
very little. As a result of the increasing use ofcomplex derivatives, however, transparencywill probably have been reduced; to that ex-tent, assessing systemic risks has not becomeeasier.
Definition and methodology
The analysis is focused on the advances and
deposits of German institutions and mainlybased on the monthly balance sheet statisticsof the German institutions and – for the an-alysis of operations with foreign institutions –reporting data from foreign branches and for-eign subsidiaries. The building and loan asso-ciations have been included in the group re-quired to report since the beginning of1999.
8To that extent, the data for 1999 are
not fully comparable with the data for earlieryears. By contrast, the securitised assets and li-abilities have been largely excluded. Firstly, se-curitised loans to other institutions – for ex-ample, in their function as surrogate debtors –are to be regarded as substitutes for publicbonds and therefore are not necessarily to beanalysed as a means of distributing liquidity
5The fundamental importance of the money market and
of the interest rates on the money market for the imple-
mentation of monetary policy and the transmission
mechanism is not covered here.

dite und systemisches Risiko. Schweizerische Zeitschrift
für Volkswirtschaft und Statistik, Vol. 134, No. 2, June
1998, pages 193–230.
7Liabilities to foreign institutions doubled between Janu-
ary (DM 65 billion) and November (DM 128 billion)
whereas liabilities to German institutions rose rather mar-
ginally (from DM 66 billion to DM 73 billion).

tions vis-à-vis the money market funds are shown as
transactions with monetary financial institutions. The

53within the banking sector and as a form of
financial linkage between the institutions.Secondly, these assets and liabilities are ex-cluded for statistical reasons as the total liabil-ities arising from bank bonds issued cannotbe broken down by purchaser group.
Unless otherwise stated, all data were con-
verted into annual averages in order to avoidwindow dressing (fluctuations arising fromchoice of reporting date). The short-terminterbank operations, which serve mainly toeven out liquidity through the money market,are not analysed in more detail here. Further-more, the institutions’ operations with theBundesbank which are primarily determinedby monetary policy were disregarded.
In principle, the unsecuritised German inter-
bank assets and liabilities ought to cancelout. In the past there was always a slight stat-istical surplus on interbank liabilities. One rea-son for this is that assets and liabilities werenot always booked on the same day, that isto say, items such as credit transfers betweeninstitutions were still in the process of beingsettled at close of business. Another reasonmay have been problems in sectoral classifica-tion encountered by parties required to re-port.
9From 1999 interbank operations are
further “distorted” in that the data reportedby the money market funds are not includedin the statistical account of interbank oper-ations in this article. Even so, the statisticallyinduced liabilities overhang declined; in 1999it no longer appeared, at least not in the aver-age up to October.If the interbank operations are examined with
respect to risk, the data taken from the bal-ance sheet statistics will probably tend to beless informative than at the end of the eight-ies, especially on account of new off-balance-sheet financial instruments such as deriva-Annual averages for 1998

54tives, which have already been discussed in
detail elsewhere.10The rapid growth in de-
rivatives business, most of which takes placeamong German and foreign credit institu-tions, reflects inter alia the increasing import-
ance of the futures markets for the manage-ment of market price risks at the level of theindividual institutions. For example, the nom-inal value of outstanding OTC contracts rosefour-fold between March 1995 (US $ 2,510billion) and December 1998 (US $ 10,831billion).
11By far the majority of these are
interest-rate-related instruments (interest-rateswaps alone account for just over one-half ofthem), which help in the management ofinterest-rate risks. This indicates that, infuture, risk-related analyses of the bankingsector and of its interdependence will haveto pay even more attention to the futuresmarkets.
Determinants of interbank operations
One of the most important determinants of
interbank operations is the pattern of trans-actions with non-banks (non-MFIs). Institu-tions with net inpayments, i.e. with a surpluson their deposit business with enterprises,households and general government, eitherinvest the funds that they do not require insecurities or lend them as advances to otherinstitutions. They act as lenders in the inter-bank market. Conversely, institutions withnet outpayments in their transactions withcustomers (asset overhang) can borrow theadditional funds required by issuing securitiesor trading on the interbank market.
12The
network of interbank relations makes it pos-sible to transfer excess liquidity to institutions
with net outflows of funds. From that pointof view they represent – at least to some ex-tent – a mirror image of the differently struc-tured business with non-banks (non-MFIs).
Payment transactions of non-banks are another
factor affecting interbank operations. They in-duce short-term liquidity fluctuations, whichhave to be balanced out in the money market.For example, average daily turnover throughinterbank payment transactions amounted toan estimated DM 830 billion in 1998; total ad-vances between German institutions reachedan average of DM 1,730 billion in 1998, theequivalent of just over two days’ turnover ininterbank payments.
Funds which the banks with special functions
transfer through the banking system to finalborrowers as part of their function as promo-tional institutions of the government (for ex-ample, assistance for setting up new busi-nesses, investment loans, local infrastructure,environmental protection) also play a signifi-cant role in interbank operations. This ex-plains the considerable lender position of thiscategory of banks.
The two sectors, that is to say, the savings
banks and Land banks, and the credit co-

55operatives and the regional institutions of
credit cooperatives, are characterised by theholding and distribution of liquidity, especiallymaturity transformation, i.e. the transfer ofinterest rate risks (see the section “Participa-tion of major categories of banks ...” below).
Another source of interbank assets and liabil-
ities is the shifting of funds within financialconglomerates (for example, between parentinstitutions and mortgage banks, direct banksand other subsidiaries). The German financialsystem is characterised both by the universalbanking concept and by a complex capital tie-up and division of labour within sectors andfinancial groups (“one-stop” financing strat-egies). In the seventies, moreover, “workingbalances” at other banks probably helped toease bilateral payments flows; however, theirimportance has now declined sharply.
German interbank operations
Relative importance and structureOn an average of the ten months up to Octo-
ber 1999 the unsecuritised interbank assetsof German credit institutions totalled approxi-mately DM 1,910 billion. They have thereforemore than doubled since 1990 (when theyamounted to roughly DM 900 billion). How-ever, this volume of DM 1,910 billion repre-sents only just a little more than one-half ofall interbank assets, which total DM 3,730 bil-lion (see the table “Relative importance ofinterbank operations”) and which includesecuritised loans to German banks (approxi-mately 9% of average business volume) andas a percentage of the average business volume

56the claims on foreign banks (just under 8%).
While the unsecuritised interbank operationsbetween German institutions have been rela-tively constant at between roughly 16
12%
and 18% of business volume since the be-ginning of the seventies, the ratio of totalinterbank lending rose from approximately27
12% to approximately 3412% between
1980 and 1990 and has remained at this levelever since.
However, the balance sheet statistics show a
very sharp rise
13– of about one-third – in the
average volume of German interbank oper-ations from 1989 to 1990. As the figures ofthe banking system in eastern Germany wereincluded for the first time, the interbank loansincreased from DM 670 billion to about DM885 billion. Short-term lending alone account-ed for just over DM 140 billion of this rise ofapproximately DM 215 billion. The specificfinancial relations that existed in the east Ger-man banking system as a result of the formercentrally planned economy led in the first fewmonths after German monetary union to aninterbank liquidity transfer from the savingsbanks and credit cooperatives via the Staats-bank, in particular, to the Deutsche Kreditbankand other institutions.
14(The balance sheet
structures of the old east German banking sys-tem were not “normalised” until later.) Owingto the lack of adequate opportunities for lend-ing to private and public borrowers, the sav-ings banks redeployed their funds stemmingfrom deposits of non-banks either as securi-tised loans or as interbank assets, which werei n t e r e s t - b e a r i n gi nb o t hc a s e s .A sar e s u l to fthe involvement of the Staatsbank and of theDeutsche Kreditbank, which was acting as theprincipal bank of the Treuhand agency, the
interbank loans grew sharply (in relation to thetotal business volume from 16
12% in 1989 to
1812% in 1990). The extensive promotional
loans subsequently granted to borrowers ineastern Germany kept the volume of interbankoperations at a high level although the Staats-bank was gradually withdrawn from the liquid-ity system and its balance sheet was reducedby this consolidation
15(disappearance of inter-
bank transactions).
Closer inspection of the breakdown of unse-
curitised German interbank operations re-veals a fairly stable trend towards longer ma-turities (see the table “Structural shifts in Ger-man interbank operations”). By the autumnof 1999 medium and long-term advances, to-talling approximately DM 1,240 billion, hadgained a share of around 65%.
16In 1970 the
ratio had been 36%. The weight of longer-term advances had already risen from 49%to 58% between 1980 and 1989 but thendeclined temporarily to 52% in 1990 owingto the preponderance of short-term interbankadvances in eastern Germany.
13As a result of the annual averages used in this article,
the actual jump from 1989 to 1990 is understated (the
inclusion of the balance sheet data of the east German
institutions meant an additional six monthly values in
1990).
14These were essentially the Bank für Landwirtschaft
und Nahrungsgüterwirtschaft, the Deutsche Außen-
handelsbank and the Deutsche Handelsbank.
15Instead of receiving funds from the Staatsbank, the
Deutsche Kreditbank now received the funds held by the
savings banks through capital market instruments.
16The jump in the case of medium-term advances be-
tween 1998 and 1999 (from 612%t o1 412%) is due to
a statistical change (maturities of “four years up to and
including five years” were classified as medium-term in-
stead of long-term, as had been the case up to the end
of 1998).Sharp increase

59One possible reason for the growing weight
of longer maturities can be seen in the shiftsin the pattern of non-bank business. The fall-ing interest rate level and the exceptionallylow interest rate phase during the past fewyears have encouraged customer demand forlong-term loans and increased investors’ pref-erence for liquidity. This has led to a growingneed for longer-term funds, especially in thecase of banks which focus on deposit busi-ness with non-banks. This need has been par-tially met by an increase in longer-term inter-bank operations. At the same time, this de-velopment helped to change the spread ofinterest rate risks within the banking sectorand – at least from the perspective of individ-ual institutions – to limit these risks. However,the banking system as a whole cannot reduceits interest rate risks through interbank oper-ations. It can only change or broaden thespread of these risks. By switching fromshort-term to long-term interbank funding,some institutions have been able to improvetheir liquidity ratio in accordance with theBanking Act, too.
17
Bill-based credit operations between thebanks which in 1998 had amounted to justunder DM 17 billion, or 1% of German inter-bank lending, came almost to a standstill lastyear. With the termination of the Bundes-bank’s rediscount credit and the quota systemnecessary as a result of the preferential rate,the banks no longer needed to acquire un-used quotas through interbank trade or fur-nish evidence of other institutions liable to abill (through their signature). Trust loans rosefrom an average of DM 4 billion in the eight-ies to just under DM 12 billion (in 1996 and
1997) before declining again in 1998–99.
18
In the case of interbank liabilities longer-termtime deposits predominate in line with thebreakdown of the assets (see the table onpage 58). At the short end of the market,too, time deposits are more important thanovernight deposits. However, the latter hadrisen from DM 95 billion to DM 195 billionbetween 1989 and 1990, a developmentwhich illustrates the highly liquid nature ofthe transactions that took place within theeast German banking system in the year ofunification.
Participation of major categories of
banks and net financial positions
The business structure of the various categor-
ies of banks largely determines the extent oftheir participation in interbank operations.This applies to the maturity transformationwithin sectors, lending business (such as pro-motional loans) that is carried out largely
17Liquidity Principles II and III will be replaced on July 1,
2000 by a new Liquidity Principle II. Whereas at present
liquidity risks are to be limited by financing longer-term
assets with resources of more or less matching maturities
(“golden balance sheet rule”) calculated on the basis of
the original maturities, the funds available at short notice
– and determined according to the residual maturity –
must in future exceed the payment obligations callable at
short notice. In the first time band (from “due on de-
mand up to one month”) the liquidity ratio must be at
least 1 while observation ratios have to be calculated for
the remaining three time bands up to three, six and 12
months. In terms of the eligibility of liquid assets there is
no difference between short-term interbank advances
and the corresponding securitised loans.
18As liability criteria play a decisive role in recording
these as interbank trust loans, the extent of the promo-
tional lending cannot be inferred from this amount. The
“interbank trust liabilities”, which amounted to an aver-
age of DM 53 billion in 1998, are somewhat more in-
formative in this respect.Interest rate

An overview of the respectiveamounts as well as of the shares of variouscategories of banks in German interbankassets and liabilities totalling about DM 1,750billion (on an annual average for 1998) is pro-vided by the tables on this page and at theend of this article. The significance of inter-bank operations in terms of the business vol-ume of the various categories of banks andthe net positions as lenders or borrowers onthe interbank market, which are derived fromthe balance on lending and deposits, are illus-trated by charts.

The banks with special functions show thelargest net lender position on the money mar-ket. In 1998 they granted interbank creditsworth DM 325 billion and had liabilities of
DM 204 billion. This gave a surplus balance ofDM 121 billion. On an average of the years1994 to 1998 this category of banks account-ed for 46% of the net funds offered on theinterbank market. As already mentioned, thisstrong lender position is due mainly to thelending business of these institutions, whichis conducted principally through third banksand which consists partly of their own ad-vances and partly of the funds provided bythird parties. The banks with special functionscan raise funds directly on the market as is-suers of bonds and are therefore not very de-Interbank assets and liabilities by category of banks*

The importance of interbank assets can alsobe seen in the fact that these accounted forabout 36% of total business volume in 1998.The sharp rise in interbank assets and liabil-ities of this category of banks from 1989 to1990–91 was mainly due to the inclusion ofthe former Staatsbank of the German Demo-cratic Republic. Subsequently the restructur-ing funds channelled into the east Germaneconomy played a fairly substantial role.
The mortgage banks have likewise found
themselves in a strong net lender positionsince about the middle of the eighties. On anaverage of the years 1994 to 1998 they had a35% share of the cumulated interbank assetposition. In 1998 they granted loans worthabout DM 285 billion on the money marketand borrowed just under DM 150 billion.Owing to their much larger total businessvolume, however, the mortgage banks’ inter-bank operations have a discernibly lowerweight than those of the banks with specialfunctions.
20The mortgage banks’ lender pos-
ition is probably due mainly to their strongposition in long-term refinancing business,which makes it easier for them to find refund-ing at attractive rates through long-term timedeposits and the issue of their own bonds. Theother institutions belonging to the same groupas the mortgage banks also benefit from thisby way of the money market. Loans to otherbanks are also admissible in the MortgageBank Act as “substitute cover”,
21an arrange-
ment which provides the institutions with moreflexibility in their refunding operations – for ex-ample, with respect to timing.In 1998 the greatest players by far in the
interbank market were the Land banks,whose interbank assets of DM 513 billion(just under 30% of the unsecuritised inter-bank assets of all German institutions) com-pared with DM 453 billion in interbank liabil-Net lender position

62ities. They perform inter alia the functions of
liquidity reservoirs and maturity transformersfor the savings banks by taking up short-termadvances from the savings banks and return-ing these to the savings banks in the form oflonger-term deposits. Consequently, the risksassociated with rising interest rates are trans-ferred to the central institutions; owing totheir wholesale banking bias and thereforesimpler means of hedging through deriva-tives, they can also bear these risks morereadily. At around 12%, calculated as theaverage of the years 1994 to 1998, the Landbanks are in third place with respect to theirnet lender position on the interbank market.Between 1990 and 1993 they were still netborrowers. From 1994 their asset positionrose regularly. This partly reflects the fact thatthe advances of the savings banks to theLand banks actually stagnated below DM 70billion as they increasingly acquired securi-tised interbank assets. In the balance sheetsof the Land banks this meant a shift awayfrom interbank deposits in favour of bondsissued.
If the unsecuritised interbank assets and liabil-
ities alone are considered, the savings banksemerge as the largest net borrowers on theinterbank market. Their interbank liabilitiestotalled about DM 120 billion on an averageof the years 1994 to 1998; that is equivalentto a 38% share of the net liability positionof all “borrower” banks (see the chart onpage 61). The interbank liabilities of the sav-ings banks had been greater than their assetsas far back as the eighties; only in 1990 and1991 – as a result of the extensive advancesby the east German savings banks – werethey temporary net “lenders” in the market for
unsecuritised interbank funds. However, thesavings banks’ borrower status, which may besurprising in the light of their strong position indeposit business with non-banks, is trans-formed into a lender status when their se-curitised loans to other banks are taken intoaccount. Thus, in 1998 the savings banksgranted advances of just under DM 133 billion,but securitised loans in the form of Germanbank bonds amounted to DM 288 billion.
22At
the same time they accepted interbankdeposits of DM 295 billion. The substitution ofsecuritised loans for advances appears to befairly attractive in view of liquidity (listing ofsecurities, recognition as eligible assets) andyields. In the past few years the sharp fall incapital market interest rates has also providedadditional profits from increased prices. How-e v e r ,g r e a t e ra t t e n t i o nm u s tb ep a i dt op r i c erisks in case of rising interest rates.
As already mentioned, the savings banks lend
mostly – i.e. about 90% – short-term ad-vances to the Land banks while the latter,conversely, maintain medium and long-termdeposits on approximately the same scale atthe primary institutions. This helps the savingsbanks to improve maturity matching in theirlong-term business with non-banks. The pat-tern of this maturity transformation has re-mained fairly stable for decades (see the charton page 63). The volumes of financial flowsbetween the individual banks and their cen-tral institutions in the savings bank sectorwere more or less balanced until 1993. From1994, however, the Land banks increased

63their deposits with the savings banks signifi-
cantly more sharply (in 1998 these amountedto just under DM 170 billion) than the rate atwhich the savings banks increased their lend-ing to the Land banks (advances to Landbanks amounted to just under DM 70 billionin 1998). To that extent, the Land banks alsochannelled long-term funds that they hadraised elsewhere, for example, through issu-ing securities, to the savings banks. It is worthnoting that the financial operations withinthis sector account for only about one-thirdof their German interbank advances in thecase of the Land banks and about one-half
23
in the case of the savings banks, which indi-cates that these categories of banks are close-ly interlinked with other institutions, too.
An almost identical picture emerges regard-
ing the maturity pattern of operations be-tween the lower level and the upper level inthe credit cooperative sector. The cooperativebanks’ mainly short-term advances to the re-gional institutions are accompanied by returnflows of largely longer-term funds. Even so,there are enormous differences. The creditcooperatives are net lenders in the bilateral fi-nancial relationship and the regional institu-tions of the credit cooperatives are net bor-rowers (see the table on page 64). One ex-planation for the relatively larger advances ofthe lower level to the regional institutionscould be that their replacement by the acqui-sition of securities issued by the upper level isnot possible to the same extent in the creditcooperative sector.
24The central institutions
apparently used the funds from the lowerlevel to increase their own holdings of secur-ities further. On an average of the years 1994to 1998 the credit cooperatives were repre-
sented on the lender side of the interbankmarket with a share of approximately 7%;over the past few years, however, there hasPercentage shares of assets vis-à-vis the

64been a downward trend. The share of the re-
gional institutions of credit cooperatives onthe borrower side was just under 16%.
The “regional banks and other commercial
banks”, which, with 32% of all borrowedfunds, are the largest borrowers after the sav-ings banks, also recorded net liability pos-itions (borrowers) on the interbank market onan average of the years 1994 to 1998. In1998 their net borrowings amounted to ap-proximately DM 100 billion while in 1996 and1997 they had been even greater.
25The big
banks (8%) and the “branches of foreignbanks” (5
12%) were also net borrowers.
However, these ratios are much less informa-tive in the case of these three categories ofbanks because they maintain to a very muchgreater extent than other categories of banksintensive interbank operations with banks
abroad, including their own branches andsubsidiaries or – in the case of branches offoreign institutions – their parent institutionsin their home countries. The financial oper-ations of the big banks with other German in-stitutions belonging to the same group asthemselves are also reflected here. Further-more, the proportion of short-term funds isrelatively larger, which is in line with theirgreater presence on the money market.Financial operations within the savings bank and credit cooperative sectors

25The Deutsche Kreditbank with its significant net
amount of liabilities in interbank operations appeared
under “Regional banks” between 1990 and 1992 but
was classified as a bank with special functions in
1993–94. There were therefore sharper fluctuations in
the interbank liabilities of these categories of banks.Regional and

65Interbank operations with foreign banks
Financial operations are also carried out be-
tween German institutions and institutionsabroad, especially the branches and subsidiar-ies
26of German banks. In the case of the last
two groups, which also have interbank oper-ations with partners abroad, the averageshare of total interbank operations in totalbusiness volume during the nineties wasabout one-half for both and was thereforevery much greater than in the case ofGerman institutions (just under 7% in thecase of assets). A trend which had alreadyemerged in the middle of the eighties, name-ly a very much sharper rise in the interbankactivities of the branches than in those of thesubsidiary banks, has tended to become evenmore accentuated in recent years (interbankadvances of branches from 1990 to 1998:+ 475%; those of subsidiaries: + 138%).Important factors here were the equity con-solidation with subsidiary institutions whichcame into force in 1985, the extensivefinancial transactions undertaken by foreignbranches with their German parent in-stitutions and other branches abroad andthe preference given to the establishmentof branches in rapidly expanding financialcentres abroad. Owing to the high degree ofintegration with foreign banks, a develop-ment which has been encouraged by thesingle European market and monetary union,the interbank funds create additional liquiditybuffers, which may lead to an even moreflexible credit supply from the banking sector.At the same time contagion risks are tendingto rise.German institutions’ operations with banks
abroad were clearly characterised by higher li-abilities in 1997 and 1998 (the net liabilityposition in 1998 amounted to more than DM100 billion). This was due to large – mainlyshort-term – inflows of deposits from foreigninstitutions (plus DM 300 billion in 1997 and1998 taken together).
27Evidently the relative-
ly large net capital exports by non-banksthrough portfolio transactions and direct in-vestment were also in balance as a result. Justover one-third (about DM 115 billion) ofthese inflows came from the German banks’own branches abroad.
28
A similar trend towards increasing liabilitiesemerged in the case of the foreign branchesand subsidiaries both in the area of specialinterbank business with institutions abroadand in interbank operations in general. In1998 the (total) negative interbank balanceamounted to approximately DM 85 billion inthe case of both branches and subsidiaries.The refunding of these institutions by non-banks could not keep pace with the rapid in-crease in lending to non-banks – especially in
26See the table “Interbank operations of German insti-
tutions, foreign branches and foreign subsidiaries with
foreign banks” on page 66. Securitised loans were ex-
cluded here, too. The term “non-residents” comprises all
countries other than Germany and therefore includes the
banks in the respective domicile of the foreign branches
and subsidiaries. As coverage is incomplete here, in con-
trast to the case regarding domestic operations, there are
sometimes large discrepancies between interbank assets
and liabilities. There is a drastic rise in the data on
branches between 1993 and 1994. This is purely statistic-
al and is the result of the assets and liabilities vis-à-vis the
parent institutions or other branches of the same institu-
tion being included for the first time.
27German banks’ net external claims on foreign institu-
tions had already begun to decline during the first half of
the nineties.
28The claims of foreign branches on banks in Germany
rose from an average of DM 138.2 billion in 1996 to
DM 253.5 billion in 1998.Strong growth

66the case of the branches – and additional
interbank funds were required to make upthe shortfall. One contributory factor wasthat the deposits of German non-banks in theEuro-market tended to stagnate, partly as aresult of the lowering of the minimum reserveratios in the mid-nineties. This weakness hasbeen accentuated since the new minimum re-serve system, including the remuneration ofreserves, came into force in the Eurosystem atthe beginning of 1999. German enterprisesand individuals have since repatriated consid-erable amounts of Euro-deposits.
By far the majority of interbank operations of
branches and subsidiaries are short-term, i.e.with maturities of up to and including oneyear. This is a reflection of both the intermedi-ary function of these institutions and the bufferfunction of interbank operations on the inter-
national money market. If there is an exceptionto this, it is the claims of foreign subsidiaries onbanks in Germany. These are not very signifi-cant in terms of the amounts involved and aremostly geared to the longer term. This evident-ly reflects the longer-term influx of funds tothe German parent institutions. One reason forthe preponderance of longer-term maturitieswas probably the former regulation governingminimum reserves. According to that regula-tion, these liabilities – which German bankshad vis-à-vis foreign institutions – with a ma-turity of less than four years were subject tothe minimum reserve requirements.
