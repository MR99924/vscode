The role of banks, non-b anks and the
central bank in the money creation process
The accommodative non-s tandard monetary policy measures taken by the Eurosystem in response
to the financial and sovereign debt crisis caused the reserves of (commercial) banks in the euro
area to increase sharply. In spite of this, the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M3
has remained at a moderate level over the past two years, reigniting interest in the connection
between the creation of reserves and growth in the broader monetary aggregate.
It suffices to look at the creation of (book) money as a set of straightforward accounting entries
to grasp that money and credit are created as the result of complex interactions between banks,
non- banks and the central bank. And a bank’s ability to grant loans and create money has noth-
ing to do with whether it already has excess reserves or deposits at its disposal. Instead, various
economic and regulatory factors constrain the process of money creation. From the perspective
of banks, the creation of money is limited by the need for individual banks to lend profitably and
also by micro and macroprudential regulations. Non- banks’ demand for credit and portfolio
behaviour likewise act to curtail the creation of money. The central bank influences the money
and credit creation process in normal times through its interest rate policy, which affects the
financing and portfolio decisions of banks and non- banks through various transmission channels.
Non- standard monetary policy measures, too, have effects on the creation of money and credit.
One such unconventional measure, the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme, differs from
interest rate policy in that it directly boosts the supply of reserves. Moreover, purchase pro-
grammes structured in this manner have an immediate expansionary impact (originating directly
from the asset purchase) on the stock of money held by non- banks, though this effect is damp-
ened in the euro area by the fact that the Eurosystem does not only purchase the assets from
domestic non- banks. There are also indirect effects resulting from the transmission of the pur-
chase programme and its impact on lending and portfolio allocation.
Critics point to the banking system’s capacity to create money as one of the main culprits behind
destabilising financial cycles and financial crises, hence the long-s tanding debate about pro-
posals to fully back deposits with central bank money, a move intended to restrict the extent to
which the banking sector can create credit. It is not evident, however, that these constraints do
indeed make for a financial system that is more stable overall than might in any case be achieved
through targeted regulatory action. At the same time, that kind of transition to a new system
would risk impairing important functions which the banking system performs for the economy
and are crucial for keeping real economic growth on a steady path.

Demographic change, immigration and the

An economy’s potential output is determined by labour input, capital services and production

incorporated into the assessment of the monetary policy stance. A projection for the German
economy shows that the available supply of labour will be influenced by two major factors over
the coming ten years. First, demographic change will lead to a marked numerical decline in the
resident population and also to a progressive ageing of the population. All other things being
equal, natural population developments will reduce the working- age population, ie the number
of persons aged between 15 and 74 years, by almost 2½ million by 2025, while the percentage
of persons aged between 55 and 74 years in the working-a ge population will rise by 7 percent-
age points to almost 40%. Second, this process is likely to be counteracted by impulses generated
by immigration, which is expected to remain at a high level.
In the baseline, the potential labour force in 2025 will approximately match its 2016 figure.
Within this period, it will rise up to 2020, with demographic developments then making them-
selves felt more strongly. This will also have an impact on the growth rate of potential output:
according to the projections, demographic trends affecting potential hours worked will play a
crucial role in potential growth falling from almost 1¼% on average between 2011 and 2016 to
well below 1% per year over the coming decade. The implied shrinking of the labour supply over
the medium term, along with progressive demographic ageing, is also likely to affect capital
accumulation and technological progress: subdued growth in the potential labour force in future
could mean that less capital will be required in the corporate sector, and the shift in the age struc-
ture in Germany could dampen labour productivity growth.
