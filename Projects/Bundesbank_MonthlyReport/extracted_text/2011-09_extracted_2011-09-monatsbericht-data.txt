CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
The	“hard”	 economic	 indicators	 available	 for	
July,	 such	 as	industrial	 and	 construction	 out-
put,	 suggest	 a	continuation	 of	Germany’s	 up-
ward 	economic 	trend 	in	the	third 	quarter 	of	
2011, 	thereby 	confirming 	the	“soft” 	senti -
ment 	indicators 	which 	point 	to	an	excellent	
state 	of	the	German 	economy 	up	until	the	
end	of	August. 	Although 	the	monthly 	rates	
of	change 	of	production 	indices 	in	July	con-
siderably 	overstate 	the	underlying 	economic	
trend	 owing	 to	the	unusually	 low	number	 of	
public	 holidays	 in	this	month,	 greater	 availa -
bility 	of	working 	hours 	only	contributes 	to	
higher 	output 	if	demand 	conditions 	are	fa-
vourable. 	Private 	consumption, 	too,	is	likely	
to	rebound	 somewhat	 from	 a	significant	 de-
cline 	in	the	second 	quarter. 	Reported 	retail	
sales	 maintained	 their	 exceptionally	 high	 level	
of	June,	 which	 implies	 that,	 even	 after	 an	ex-
pected 	downward 	correction, 	a	perceptible	
increase	 is	likely	 to	be	posted	 on	the	second	
quarter.	 New	 passenger	 car	registrations	 rose	
again 	perceptibly. 	Thus, 	overall, 	a	strong 	in-
crease	 in	economic	 output	 is	to	be	expected	
for	the	third	 quarter	 of	2011.
With 	regard 	to	future 	developments, 	it	re-
mains 	to	be	seen 	to	what 	extent 	the	strong	
stock	 market	 declines	 and	the	sharp	 deterio -
ration 	of	expectations 	will	actually 	influence	
households’	 and	 enterprises’	 activities.	 How -
ever, 	the	medium-term 	outlook 	has	recently	
deteriorated	 more	 sharply	 than	 previously	 ex-
pected	 amidst	 increased	 uncertainty.Strong GDP

Industry
On	a	seasonally	 adjusted	 basis,	 industrial	 out-
put	increased 	by	4.5% 	month-on-month 	in	
July	and	by	4.2% 	quarter-on-quarter. 	Two-
thirds 	of	the	strong 	month-on-month 	in-
crease	 can	be	explained	 by	the	smaller-than-
average 	number 	of	school 	holidays 	in	July	
and	the	additional	 bridging	 day	in	June.	 Con-
sequently,	 the	pendulum	 is	likely	 to	swing	 the	
other 	way	in	August, 	which 	has	a	greater	
number 	of	holidays. 	However, 	in	order 	to	
keep	 up	with	 their	 full	order	 books,	 some	 car	
manufacturers 	did	not	close 	their	plants 	this	
summer, 	which 	means 	that	part	of	the	cor-
rection	 will	probably	 not	be	felt	until	 Septem -
ber.	The	special 	effects 	were 	particularly	
prominent 	in	capital 	goods, 	the	output 	of	
which	 rose	 by	6¼%	 compared	 with	 the	previ -
ous	quarter. 	Regarding 	intermediate 	goods,	
output 	growth 	remained 	at	3%	despite 	the	
advanced 	stage 	of	the	business 	cycle, 	while	
consumer 	goods 	output 	grew 	by	around	
1¾%.
In	July,	 the	inflow	 of	new	 industrial	 orders	 fell	
rather 	perceptibly 	by	a	seasonally 	adjusted	
2¾% 	from 	the	previous 	month. 	Compared	
with 	the	second-quarter 	average, 	it	was	
down	 by	1 %.	 It	should	 be	noted	 in	this	con-
text,	however, 	that	the	usually 	irregular 	in-
flow	of	large 	orders 	was	especially 	high	in	
June,	 as	in	May	 already.	 It	was	 for	this	reason	
that	 orders	 of	capital	 goods	 fell	considerably	
in	July,	whereas 	orders 	of	intermediate 	and	
consumer 	goods 	saw	a	noticeable 	increase.	
Domestic	 demand	 rose	 by	a	very	 strong	 3½%	
compared 	with	June 	while 	foreign 	demand	
fell	by	7½% 	as	a	result 	of	the	considerably	Strong increase 
in output also due to holiday effects

reduced 	volume 	of	large 	orders 	in	compari -
son	with	 the	previous	 month.
The	strong 	seasonally 	adjusted 	month-on-
month 	increase 	in	sales 	of	4%	in	July	was	
probably 	also	caused 	by	holiday 	effects. 	Do-
mestic	 and	foreign	 sales	 experienced	 roughly	
equal	 growth.	 In	particular,	 producers	 of	cap-
ital	goods	 were	 able	 to	boost	 their	 sales.	 This	
is,	however, 	not	reflected 	in	goods 	exports,	
which	 declined	 by	1¾%.	 The	value	 of	imports	
decreased	 by	¼%.
Construction
Construction	 output	 grew	 by	a	hefty	 3¼%	 in	
July,	thereby 	largely 	offsetting 	its	June 	de-
cline. 	The	average 	quarter-on-quarter 	in-
crease 	was	a	slight 	½%. 	Fuelled 	by	robust	
residential 	construction, 	among 	other 	fac-
tors,	general 	building 	rose	by	1¾%, 	while	
civil	engineering 	fell	by	1½%. 	There 	was	a	
substantial 	decrease 	in	the	rather 	volatile	
construction 	orders 	in	June 	compared 	with	
May	 (no	newer	 data	 are	available	 at	present).	
The	decline 	in	residential 	construction 	was	
particularly 	sizeable, 	albeit 	following 	strong	
growth	 in	May.	 Compared	 with	 the	first	quar-
ter,	orders 	declined 	by	a	seasonally 	adjusted	
¾%	 in	the	second.
Labour market
The	favourable 	development 	on	the	labour	
market 	continued 	at	a	slower 	pace. 	Accord -
ing	to	provisional 	figures 	from 	the	Federal	
Statistical 	Office, 	the	number 	of	employed	
persons	 in	Germany	 grew	 by	a	seasonally	 ad-
justed 	19,000, 	which 	constitutes 	a	signifi -cantly 	smaller 	increase 	than 	in	previous	
months. 	Compared 	with	the	previous 	year,	
this	constitutes 	an	increase 	of	527,000, 	or	
1.3%.	 The	number	 of	persons	 in	jobs	 subject	
to	full	social	 security	 contributions	 is	likely	 to	
have 	increased 	further. 	Year-on-year 	job	
growth 	in	June 	amounted 	to	684,000 	or	
2.5%. 	Although 	the	Federal 	Employment	
Agency’s	 BA-X	 index	 rose	 again,	 according	 to	
the	ifo	employment 	barometer, 	enterprises’	
willingness	 to	recruit	 new	 staff	 fell	strongly	 in	
August,	 though	 from	 a	very	 high	 level.
As	in	previous 	months, 	the	seasonally 	ad-
justed 	number 	of	persons 	registered 	as	un-
employed	 in	August	 decreased	 again	 slightly,	
to	2.95	 million	 at	present.	 The	seasonally	 ad-
justed	 unemployment	 rate	 (using	 the	Federal	
Employment	 Agency’s	 definition)	 remained	 at	
7.0%.	 Given	 that	 labour	 market	 policy	 meas -
ures	 are	being	 scaled	 back	 as	a	result	 of	the	
improved 	employment 	situation, 	year-on-
year	underemployment 	(including 	persons	
taking	 part	 in	labour	 market	 policy	 measures)	
fell	a	great 	deal	more 	(by	504,000 	persons)	
than 	did	registered 	unemployment 	(by	
238,000	 persons).
Prices
At	a	monthly 	average 	of	US$110 	in	August,	
the	price	 for	a	barrel	 of	Brent	 crude	 was	 off	
markedly 	from 	the	previous 	month. 	Amidst	
fears 	of	output 	losses 	as	a	result 	of	the	US	
hurricane	 season	 and	the	expectation	 of	Lib-
yan	oil	production 	only	slowly 	returning 	to	
normal, 	it	rebounded 	perceptibly 	in	the	first	
week 	of	September. 	As	this	report 	went 	to	
press,	 the	price	 per	barrel	 of	crude	 oil	stood	Domestic sales

at	US$112½. 	Crude 	oil	futures 	were 	being	
quoted 	at	a	discount 	of	US$5¾ 	six	months	
ahead	 and	US$7	 12	months	 ahead.
The	slight 	increase 	in	oil	prices 	in	July	also	
made 	itself 	felt	at	the	upstream 	stages. 	Im-
ports 	in	July	were 	0.8% 	more 	expensive 	in	
seasonally 	adjusted 	terms 	than 	in	June. 	The	
price	 of	energy	 imports	 alone	 grew	 by	2.6%;	
imports 	excluding 	energy 	climbed 	by	0.4%.	
Prices 	of	domestically 	produced 	goods 	rose	
by	0.7%;	 excluding	 energy,	 they	 were	 up	by	
0.2%. 	Import 	prices 	were 	up	by	a	consider -
able	7.5% 	year-on-year, 	and	domestic 	pro-
ducer	 prices	 rose	 by	5.8%	 over	 the	same	 pe-
riod.
Consumer 	prices 	decreased 	in	August 	by	
0.1 % 	on	the	month 	after 	seasonal 	adjust -
ment.	 Following	 the	decline	 in	crude	 oil	prices	
in	August,	 energy	 was	cheaper,	 whereas	 food	
became 	somewhat 	more 	expensive. 	No	ma-
jor	changes 	occurred 	in	the	prices 	of	indus -
trial	goods 	and	services. 	Annual 	inflation 	re-
mained 	unchanged 	at	+2.4% 	according 	to	
the	national 	CPI	and	fell	from 	+2.6% 	to	
+2.5%	 according	 to	the	HICP .
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
Together, 	the	health 	insurance 	fund 	and	the	
statutory	 health	 insurance	 institutions	 posted	
a	surplus 	of	almost 	€2	billion 	in	the	second	
quarter 	of	2011. 	Compared 	with	the	same	
period	 last	year,	 this	constituted	 an	improve -
ment	 of	€1½	 billion.	 At	€1	billion,	 the	health	insurance 	fund’s 	surplus 	was	up	by	€½	bil-
lion.	The	health 	insurance 	institutions 	also	
recorded 	a	surplus 	of	€1	billion, 	compared	
with	only	a	virtually 	balanced 	budget 	one	
year	 previously.	 Overall,	 the	health	 insurance	
scheme’s 	revenue 	rose	by	5½% 	whereas, 	at	
just	over	 2%,	 growth	 in	expenditure	 was	 rel-
atively	 moderate.
The	health	 insurance	 institutions	 benefited	 in	
particular	 from	 a	clear	 fall	in	expenditure	 on	
pharmaceuticals 	(-8%) 	owing 	to	the	higher	
manufacturer	 discounts	 and	lower	 maximum	
prices 	in	place 	since 	August 	2010. 	By	con-
trast,	 spending	 on	in-patient	 and	out-patient	
care	 (at	4%	and	3½%,	 respectively)	 increased	
considerably.	 Growth	 in	spending	 on	sickness	
benefit	 was	again	 strong	 (+7½%),	 a	develop -
ment 	which 	was	probably 	due,	not	least, 	to	
the	sharp	 rise	in	the	number	 of	insurees	 ap-
proaching 	retirement 	(ie	aged 	60	to	64)	
which	 has	been	 evident	 for	some	 time	 now.	
Overall,	 in	the	second	 quarter,	 growth	 in	ex-
penditure 	continued 	to	be	much 	lower 	than	
the	estimates 	for	the	year	as	a	whole 	(ap-
proximately 	4%), 	which 	form 	the	basis 	for	
the	equal 	monthly 	transfers 	from 	the	health	
insurance	 fund.	 The	health	 insurance	 institu -
tions’	 expenditure	 thus	 looks	 likely	 to	fall	be-
low	these	 estimates.

bution 	receipts 	was	more 	favourable 	than	Import and

forecast.	 As	the	fund’s	 transfers	 to	the	health	
insurance	 institutions	 are	fixed,	 the	surplus	 is	
thus	likewise 	higher 	than 	expected. 	Contri -
bution 	receipts 	went 	up	by	6½%, 	although	
the	rise	in	the	general	 contribution	 rate	 from	
14.9%	 to	15.5%	 at	the	start	 of	the	year	 ac-
counted	 for	as	much	 as	4	percentage	 points	
of	this	increase. 	The	fact	that	the	contribu -
tion	 base	 for	the	unemployed	 and	short-time	
workers	 declined	 sharply	 and	 that	 total	 pen-
sions 	virtually 	stagnated 	in	the	second 	quar-
ter	following 	the	waiver 	of	the	mid-2010	
pension	 adjustment	 counteracted	 the	favour -
able	employment 	and	pay	trends 	for	contri -
bution	 receipts.
A	surplus	 is	on	the	horizon	 for	the	statutory	
health	 insurance	 scheme	 as	a	whole,	 and	it	is	
likely	 to	be	much	 higher	 than	 the	amount	 of	
just	over	 €3	billion	 forecast	 in	autumn	 2010.	
The	health 	insurance 	fund 	will	probably 	ac-
count 	for	the	largest 	share 	of	this	surplus,	
meaning	 that	 it	will	have	 sizeable	 funds	 with	
which	 to	finance	 a	social	 equalisation	 scheme	
up	to	the	end	of	2014.2	From	 2015,	 compen -
sation	 from	 the	central	 government	 budget	 is	
planned.
In	2012, 	the	financial 	situation 	of	the	statu -
tory	 health	 insurance	 scheme	 is	set	to	deteri -
orate. 	Under 	current 	law,	which 	leaves 	the	
general 	contribution 	rate	unchanged, 	trans -
fers	from	 the	central	 government	 budget	 will	
then 	be	reduced 	in	total 	from 	almost 	€15½	
billion	 to	the	ceiling	 of	€14	 billion	 which	 ap-
plies	 from	 2012	 onwards.	 In	addition,	 the	ad 
hoc	measures	 in	place	 since	 August	 last	year	
will	by	then	 have	 very	 little	 impact	 in	restrain -
ing	growth 	in	expenditure 	on	pharmaceuti -cals.	At	the	same 	time, 	expenditure 	as	a	
whole 	is	likely 	to	rise	at	a	faster 	pace 	than	
income	 subject	 to	compulsory	 insurance	 con-
tributions.
Public long-term care insurance scheme
In	the	second	 quarter	 of	2011	 –	like	one	year	
previously 	–	the	public 	long-term 	care	insur -
ance	 scheme	 recorded	 a	slight	 surplus.	 While	
the	pace 	of	growth 	picked 	up	again 	some -
what 	for	revenue 	(close 	to	2½%), 	it	slowed	
for	expenditure	 (just	 short	 of	2%).	 Given	 the	Health

up	by	3½%,	 whereas	 contributions	 on	behalf	
of	recipients 	of	unemployment 	transfers 	fell	
by	a	further	 11 %.	 In	addition,	 pensioner	 con-
tributions	 stagnated,	 echoing	 the	scenario	 in	
the	health	 insurance	 scheme.	 On	the	expend -
iture 	side, 	growth 	in	non-financial 	benefits	
slowed	 to	2½%,	 and	 spending	 on	cash	 ben-
efits	 to	persons	 in	need	 of	nursing	 care	 actu-
ally	fell	by	½%	 on	the	year.	 In	mid-2011,	 liq-

The	public 	long-term 	care	insurance 	scheme	
is	likely	 to	record	 another	 end-of-year	 surplus	in	2011.	 The	next	 increase	 in	benefit	 rates	 (by	
an	average	 of	just	under	 2%)	 is	scheduled	 to	
take	 place	 at	the	beginning	 of	2012.	 This	 will	
be	followed	 by	adjustments	 every	 three	 years.	
Together 	with	the	demographically 	induced	
deterioration	 in	the	ratio	 of	contribution	 pay-
ers	to	recipients 	of	long-term 	care	benefits,	
this	means	 that	 expenditure	 is	highly	 likely	 to	
rise	at	a	continually	 faster	 pace	 than	 revenue	
–	assuming	 the	contribution	 rate	 remains	 un-
changed.	 Additionally	 expanding	 benefits,	 as	
is	presently 	under 	discussion, 	would 	require	
the	contribution 	rate	to	be	put	up	even 	fur-
ther.	 The	current	 favourable	 situation	 of	hav-
ing	reserves 	and	slight 	surpluses 	should 	not	
lull	us	into	underestimating	 the	funding	 prob -
lems 	that	lie	ahead 	for	the	public 	long-term	
care	 insurance	 scheme.	 If	an	additional	 capi-
tal	stock 	is	to	be	built	up	within 	the	public	
long-term	 care	 insurance	 scheme,	 the	contri -
bution	 rate	 would	 have	 to	be	raised	 further.	
Although 	the	strain 	on	future 	contribution	
payers	 could	 then	 be	eased	 by	running	 down	
financial	 reserves,	 it	would	 be	essential	 to	en-
sure	 that	 the	reserves	 are	not	misused	 for	in-
creasing 	benefits 	or	reducing 	the	contribu -
tion	 burden	 in	some	 cases.

Equity market
Unlike	 in	the	preceding	 months,	 issuing	 activ-
ity	in	the	German 	equity 	market 	in	July	was	
very	subdued. 	Domestic 	–	for	the	most 	part	
unlisted	 –	companies	 issued	 only	 €0.1	 billion	
worth 	of	new	shares. 	The	outstanding 	vol-
ume	of	foreign 	equities 	in	the	German 	mar-
ket	sank	 by	€6.0	 billion.	 On	balance,	 foreign	
investors 	were 	the	sole	purchasers 	of	equi-
ties,	spending 	€0.5 	billion. 	By	contrast, 	do-
mestic 	non-banks 	and	credit 	institutions 	dis-
posed	 of	equities	 worth	 €4.0	 billion	 and	€2.4	
billion	 net	respectively.
Mutual fund shares
In	July,	domestic 	mutual 	funds 	recorded 	in-
flows 	of	€6.4 	billion 	net,	the	majority 	of	
which 	was	channelled 	into	specialised 	funds	
reserved 	for	institutional 	investors 	(€3.6 	bil-
lion).	 Of	the	domestic	 mutual	 funds	 open	 to	
the	general 	public, 	equity-based 	funds 	were	
virtually	 alone	 in	being	 able	 to	sell	new	 shares	
worth 	€3.1	billion 	net.	By	contrast, 	foreign	
mutual 	funds 	recorded 	modest 	outflows 	in	
the	reporting 	month 	(€1.9 	billion). 	Mutual	
fund	 shares	 were	 acquired	 chiefly	 by	resident	
non-banks	 and	foreign	 investors	 in	July	(€2.8	
billion 	respectively). 	Domestic 	credit 	institu -
tions, 	by	contrast, 	sold	mutual 	fund 	shares	
with	 a	value	 of	€1.1	 billion	 net.
Balance of payments
The	German	 current	 account	 recorded	 a	sur-
plus	 –	in	unadjusted	 terms	 –	of	€7.5	 billion	 in	
July	2011. 	The	result 	was	€4.0 	billion 	down	on	the	level	 of	the	previous	 month.	 This	 was	
attributable 	to	a	narrower 	trade 	surplus 	and	
to	the	fact	that	 invisible	 current	 transactions,	
which	 comprise	 services,	 income	 and	current	
transfers,	 reverted	 to	a	deficit.
According 	to	provisional 	figures 	released 	by	
the	Federal 	Statistical 	Office, 	in	July	the	for-
eign	 trade	 surplus	 went	 down	 by	€2.3	 billion	
on	the	month 	to	€10.4 	billion. 	After 	adjust -
ment	 for	seasonal	 and	 calendar	 variations,	 it	
decreased	 by	€1.4	 billion	 to	€10.1	 billion.	 The	
value 	of	exports 	declined 	more 	significantly	
(-1.8%) 	than 	that	of	imports 	(-0.3%). 	Com -
pared	 with	 the	average	 for	the	second	 quar-
ter	of	2011, 	seasonally 	adjusted 	nominal 	ex-
ports 	fell	by	1.2%, 	whereas 	imports 	rose	by	
1.1 %. 	In	this	context, 	price 	effects 	were 	of	
secondary	 importance.
Invisible	 current	 transactions	 posted	 a	deficit	
of	€1.7	billion 	in	July,	compared 	with	a	sur-
plus	of	€0.6 	billion 	in	June. 	This	can	be	at-
tributed 	to	a	deterioration 	in	all	three 	sub-
accounts.	 The	deficit	 on	services	 went	 up	by	
€1.0	 billion	 to	€2.2	 billion	 inter alia 	as	a	result	
of	increased	 expenditure	 on	travel.	 The	defi-
cit	in	current	 transfers	 widened	 from	 €2.9	 bil-
lion	to	€3.7	 billion,	 which	 was	 chiefly	 due	to	
higher 	government 	payments 	to	the	EU	
budget. 	At	the	same 	time, 	the	surplus 	in	
cross-border	 income	 narrowed	 by	€0.5	 billion	
to	stand	 at	€4.1	 billion.
Cross-border 	portfolio 	investment 	also	re-
corded 	net	capital 	imports 	in	July	(€4.8 	bil-
lion),	 albeit	 substantially	 lower	 than	 those	 in	
the	previous 	month. 	German 	investors 	dis-

€8.8 	billion. 	They 	sold	not	just	bonds 	and	
notes	 (€5.3	 billion) 	but	also	 shares	 (€3.3	 bil-
lion)	and	mutual 	fund 	shares 	(€1.9 	billion).	
Foreign 	investors 	acted 	in	a	similar 	fashion,	
reducing 	their 	investment 	in	Germany 	by	
€4.0	 billion.	 While	 selling	 German	 public	 and	
private 	debt 	securities 	to	the	tune 	of	€16.8	
billion, 	they	exhibited 	a	particular 	interest 	in	
purchasing 	money 	market 	instruments 	(€9.5	
billion)	 and	 mutual	 fund	 shares	 (€2.8	 billion)	
issued	 in	Germany.
With 	respect 	to	direct 	investment, 	the	July	
sub-account	 was	 close	 to	balance.	 No	tangi -
ble	renewed 	investment 	abroad 	on	the	part	
of	German	 firms	 was	recorded,	 nor	was	there	
any	sign	of	significant 	new	investment 	in	
Germany	 by	foreign	 firms.
Other	 statistically	 recorded	 investment,	 com-
prising 	financial 	and	trade 	credits 	(inasmuch	
as	these	 do	not	constitute	 a	part	 of	direct	 in-
vestment)	 as	well	 as	bank	 deposits	 and	other	
assets,	 saw	 net	capital	 imports	 of	€1.4	 billion	
in	July.	 Non-banks	 reported	 inflows	 of	funds	
worth	 €9.8	 billion.	 The	operations	 of	general	
government 	resulted 	in	an	inflow 	of	funds	
amounting 	to	€13.3 	billion, 	whereby 	a	par-
ticular 	emphasis 	was	placed 	on	reducing 	its	
short-term 	bank 	deposits 	abroad. 	By	con-
trast,	 the	activities	 of	enterprises	 and	 house -
holds 	generated 	capital 	outflows 	totalling	
€3.6 	billion. 	The	banking 	system 	also	re-
ported 	capital 	outflows 	(€8.4 	billion), 	with	
€2.6	 billion	 of	this	sum	 emanating	 from	 Ger-
man	credit 	institutions 	and	the	Bundesbank	
accounting 	for	the	remaining 	€5.8 	billion.

The performance of German credit institutions 
in 2010
After 	two	consecutive 	loss-making 	years, 	in	the	reporting 	year	the	German 	banking 	sector	
posted	 an	aggregated	 profit	 for	the	year	 before	 tax	of	€17.8	 billion;	 this	represented	 a	strong	
increase	 compared	 with	 2009.	 In	terms	 of	the	development	 of	longer-term	 profitability,	 there -
fore,	 there	 were	 again	 signs	 that	 the	earnings	 situation	 was,	 on	the	whole,	 returning	 to	normal	
in	the	year	 under	 review.	 However,	 a	comparison	 with	 results	 from	 previous	 years	 is	subject	 to	
certain	 limitations,	 given	 that	 the	new	 accounting	 rules	 laid	down	 in	the	Act	Modernising	 Ac-
counting	 Law	 (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz) 	became	 mandatory	 in	the	reporting	 year.	 The	
data	 on	which	 this	article	 is	based	 cannot	 be	used	 to	quantify	 this	effect,	 however,	 due	 to	the	
absence	 of	comparable	 figures	 under	 the	old	accounting	 method	 for	the	2010	 financial	 year.
Despite	 a	–	for	the	most	 part	 –	strong	 improvement	 across	 almost	 all	categories	 of	banks,	 profit -
ability	 in	2010	 was	 again	 characterised	 by	a	marked	 divergence	 in	the	annual	 results	 between	
–	and	in	some	 cases	 also	 within	 –	those	 categories.	 Special	 purpose	 banks,	 savings	 banks,	 credit	
cooperatives 	as	well	as	regional 	banks 	reported 	considerable 	increases 	in	pre-tax 	profits 	com-
pared	 with	 the	previous	 year.	 By	contrast,	 of	the	categories	 of	banks	 which	 posted	 a	loss	in	the	
previous 	year, 	only	the	big	banks 	are	again 	reporting 	a	profit 	before 	tax.	Landesbanken 	and	
mortgage 	banks, 	on	the	other 	hand, 	continue 	to	record 	–	albeit 	significantly 	smaller 	–	losses.	
The	regional	 institutions	 of	credit	 cooperatives	 were	 the	only	 category	 of	banks	 which	 sustained	
a	reduction	 in	their	 annual	 result	 while	 still	posting	 a	considerable	 profit	 before	 tax.	Overall	 per-
formance	 was	supported	 by	a	sharp	 reduction	 in	net	valuation	 charges,	 in	losses	 in	the	“extraor -
dinary 	account” 	and	in	staff	costs. 	By	contrast, 	a	slight 	decline 	in	the	operating 	result 	had	a	
negative	 effect;	 here,	 lower	 profits	 in	own-account	 trading	 as	well	 as	a	marked	 deterioration	 in	
other	 operating	 income	 or	charges	 more	 than	 offset	 growth	 in	net	interest	 and	net	commissions	
received.	 Despite	 the	favourable	 annual	 result,	 an	overall	 balance	 sheet	 loss	of	€0.8	 billion	 was	
posted 	which 	resulted 	from 	high	losses 	brought 	forward 	and	substantial 	net	transfers 	to	the	
fund	 for	general	 banking	 risks.	 However,	 this	loss	was	 concentrated	 on	only	 a	few	categories	 of	
banks	 and	on	a	small	 number	 of	banks	 within	 those	 categories.
Despite	a	favourable	setting	at	the	beginning	of	the	year,	we	can	expect	a	deterioration	in	earn -
ings	 prospects	 for	the	2011	 financial	 year	 paired	 with	 greater	 uncertainty.	 Thus,	 notwithstanding	
the	beneficial	 effects	 that	 domestic	 lending	 business	 is	having	 on	the	banks’	 results	 and	which	
are	due	to	positive 	domestic 	economic 	activity, 	it	is	likely 	that	earnings 	potentials 	will	remain	
within	 clear	 limits	 on	account,	 in	particular,	 of	the	European	 sovereign	 debt	 crisis	 and	the	associ -
ated	 increase	 in	volatility	 on	the	financial	 markets.DEUTSCHE

Preliminary remarks
In	the	2010	 financial	 year,	 the	new	 account -
ing	rules 	under 	the	Act	Modernising 	Ac-
counting 	Law	became 	binding 	for	the	first	
time	 in	respect	 of	German	 credit	 institutions’	
individual 	and	consolidated 	statements	
drawn 	up	under 	the	German 	Commercial	
Code 	(Handelsgesetzbuch) .	This	 resulted, 	in-
ter alia ,	in	fundamental 	conceptual 	changes	
with	 regard	 to	the	reporting	 of	a	number	 of	
the	items	 in	the	profit	 and	loss	(P/L)	 account;	
these	 changes	 were	 subsequently	 reflected	 in	
the	Bundesbank’s 	statistics 	of	the	banks’	
profit	 and	loss	accounts	 calculated	 on	the	ba-
sis	of	the	published 	individual 	accounts	
drawn 	up	in	accordance 	with	the	German	
Commercial	 Code.
Perhaps	 the	most	 significant	 changes	 affect -
ing	the	Bundesbank’s	 statistics	 of	the	banks’	
profit	 and	 loss	accounts	 result	 from	 the	new	
rules	 governing	 the	reporting	 of	own-account	
trading,	 pension	 provisions	 and	currency	 con-
version.	 In	the	year	 under	 review,	 they	 led	to	
changes 	in	the	conceptual 	reporting 	of	the	
items 	net	profit 	or	net	loss	from 	the	trading	
portfolio1,	net	interest	 received	 and	net	com-
missions	 received,	 staff	 costs,	 net	other	 oper-
ating 	income 	or	charges 	and	transfers 	to	or	
withdrawals	 from	 the	fund	 for	general	 bank -
ing	risks.	 Moreover,	 changes	 arose	 in	the	“ex-
traordinary 	account” 	because, 	on	the	one	
hand,	 the	item	 transfers	 to	or	release	 of	spe-
cial	reserves 	was	eliminated. 	On	the	other	
hand, 	income 	and	expenses 	in	connection	
with	the	first-time 	application 	of	the	Act	
Modernising	 Accounting	 Law	 were	 to	be	re-ported 	under 	extraordinary 	income 	or	ex-
traordinary	 expenses.
Because	 of	these	 conceptual	 changes,	 direct	
comparability 	of	the	results 	of	the	Bundes -
bank’s	 statistics	 of	the	banks’	 P/L	accounts	 for	
the	2009	 and	2010	 financial	 years	 is,	in	part,	
severely	 limited.	 This	 applies,	 in	particular,	 to	
the	above-mentioned	 P/L	items	 that	 were	 af-
fected 	by	the	new	rules 	set	forth 	in	the	Act	
Modernising 	Accounting 	Law. 	However, 	a	
comparison 	of	the	operating 	result 	(before	
and	after 	valuation) 	and	the	annual 	result	
(before	 and	after	 tax)	with	 the	corresponding	
prior-year 	figures 	is	likely 	to	be	less	strongly	
affected 	since, 	on	the	whole, 	opposing 	new	
accounting	 rules	 offset	 one	another	 to	an	ex-
tent.	 Moreover,	 a	year-on-year	 comparison	 of	
the	individual	 P/L	items	 in	relation	 to	the	av-
erage 	balance 	sheet 	total 	may	also	contain	
distorting	 effects	 as	a	result	 of	new	 rules	 on	
the	reporting	 of	assets	 and	 liabilities	 that	 af-

terest 	income 	fall	sharply.2	One	reason 	was	
probably	 an	almost	 constant	 downward	 shift	
of	the	yield 	curve 	until	the	end	of	August	
2010	 at	both	 the	short	 and	the	long	 end,	 al-
though	 upward	 shifts	 partially	 offset	 this	de-
velopment	 during	 the	remainder	 of	the	year.	
On	balance, 	the	percentage 	decrease 	of	in-
terest	 expense	 was	greater	 than	 that	 of	inter-
est	income,	 so	that,	 in	the	aggregate,	 net	in-
terest 	received 	–	ie	the	difference 	between	
interest 	income 	and	interest 	expense 	–	rose	
slightly	 by	€0.7	 billion	 to	€92.1	 billion.	 How -
ever,	 it	must	 be	taken	 into	consideration	 here	
that,	 unlike	 in	the	previous	 year,	 the	changed	
reporting 	regulations 	pursuant 	to	the	Act	
Modernising 	Accounting 	Law	probably 	also	
had	an	effect	 on	net	interest	 received.
The	share 	of	net	interest 	received 	in	operat -
ing	income3	rose	by	0.7	percentage 	points	
to	73.2%,	 which	 is	slightly	 below	 the	average	
for	the	period 	1993-2009. 	The	interest 	mar-
gin,	calculated	 as	net	interest	 received	 in	rela-
tion	to	the	average 	balance 	sheet 	total, 	re-
mained	 unchanged	 at	1.14%	 compared	 with	
the	previous	 year.	 After	 adjustment	 for	inter-
bank 	business, 	which 	has	no	effect 	on	net	
interest 	received, 	the	interest 	margin 	fell	
slightly 	in	the	year	under 	review 	to	1.55%,	
however.
Among	 the	various	 categories	 of	banks,	 par-
ticularly	 those	 for	which	 classical	 lending	 and	
deposit 	business 	is	traditionally 	very	impor -
tant	 again	 posted	 an	increase	 in	net	interest	
received. 	Both 	in	the	case	of	savings 	banks	
and	credit 	cooperatives, 	the	decline 	in	inter-
est	income 	was	more 	than 	offset 	by	the	
stronger 	decline 	in	interest 	expense. 	Savings	banks’ 	net	interest 	received 	rose	by	4.1 % 	to	
€23.5	 billion,	 while	 the	share	 of	interest	 busi-
ness	in	operating 	income 	was	at	much 	the	
same	 level	 (79.1 %)	 as	one	year	 earlier	 for	this	
banking	 category.	 As	in	2009,	 credit	 coopera -
tives	again 	posted 	a	pronounced 	increase 	in	
net	interest	 received,	 which	 rose	 by	8.0%	 to	
a	record 	high	of	€16.3 	billion. 	According 	to	
the	published	 annual	 reports,	 this	was	 gener -
ated	by	increased 	volumes 	in	deposit 	and

net	interest 	income 	in	operating 	business	
rose	to	78.9%; 	this	level	was	similar 	to	that	
for	savings 	banks. 	Regional 	banks 	also	saw	
net	interest 	received 	rise,	by	9.9% 	to	€12.7	
billion. 	As	was	the	case	with	savings 	banks	
and	credit	 corporations,	 they	 reported	 only	 a	
relatively	 small	 decrease	 in	interest	 income	 in	
2010.	 However,	 according	 to	published	 infor-
mation, 	regional 	banks 	scaled 	back 	their 	in-
terest 	expense 	appreciably, 	inter alia 	by	pay-
ing	a	lower	 rate	 of	interest	 on	customer	 de-
posits.4
By	contrast, 	big	banks, 	Landesbanken 	and	
mortgage	 banks	 reported	 a	decline	 in	net	in-
terest 	received. 	At	big	banks, 	the	difference	
between 	interest 	income 	and	interest 	ex-
pense 	contracted 	by	7.0% 	to	€19.6 	billion;	however, 	very	mixed 	developments 	within	
the	category 	were 	behind 	this	movement.	
The	share	 of	net	interest	 received	 in	total	 op-

billion,5	their	 share	 of	net	interest	 received	 in	
operating	 income	 was	 up	by	3.0	percentage	
points	 to	84.4%.	 This	 illustrates	 that	 total	 in-
come 	from 	operational 	business 	at	the	
Landesbanken	 decreased	 more	 strongly	 than	
net	interest	 received.
Net commission income
Following 	a	decline 	in	net	commissions 	re-
ceived 	in	the	previous 	three 	years, 	German	
banks 	reported 	an	improved 	result 	for	the	
first	time	again 	in	the	2010 	financial 	year.6	
The	increase 	in	net	commissions 	received 	by	
€1.2 	billion 	(+4.5%) 	to	€28.6 	billion 	was	
driven 	by	higher 	commissions 	received,	
whereas	 commissions	 paid	 were	 virtually	 un-
changed. 	As	a	result, 	net	commissions 	re-
ceived 	accounted 	for	0.35% 	of	the	average	
balance 	sheet 	total, 	compared 	with	0.34%	
one	year	 before.	 The	importance	 of	net	com-
missions 	received 	for	German 	banks’ 	opera -
tional	 business	 –	measured	 as	the	percentage	
share 	of	this	item	in	total 	operating 	income	
–	was, 	at	22.7%, 	also	slightly 	higher. 	Thus,	
commission 	business 	remained 	a	significant	
source 	of	income 	for	German 	credit 	institu -
tions. 	As	with	net	interest 	income, 	it	should	
be	noted 	that	the	effect 	of	the	mandatory,	
first-time	 application	 of	the	Act	Modernising	
Accounting	 Law	 is	likely	 to	be	reflected	 in	net	
commissions 	received 	as	well, 	so	that	com-
parison 	with	the	previous 	year’s 	figures 	is	
subject	 to	certain	 restrictions.
The	improvement 	in	net	commissions 	re-
ceived 	was	probably 	attributable, 	inter alia ,	
to	positive	 developments	 on	the	international	stock	 markets,	particularly	 in	the	fourth	quar -
ter	of	2010. 	Following 	the	massive 	slump 	in	
2009,	 turnover	 in	shares	 in	the	German	 stock	
markets	 last	year	 went	 up	by	12%;	 and	after	
two	very	 weak	 years,	 a	number	 of	enterprises	
again	 decided	 to	go	public.	 At	the	same	 time,	
it	is	likely	 that	 net	commissions	 received	 rose	
last	year	 due	to	the	strong	 interest	 shown	 by	
bank 	customers 	in	mutual 	fund 	shares. 	The	
acquisition	 of	mutual	 fund	 shares	 by	domes -
tic	non-banks 	alone 	increased 	by	€48.8 	bil-
lion	to	€100.4	 billion	 in	2010.
With	 the	exception	 of	regional	 institutions	 of	
credit 	cooperatives,7	branches 	of	foreign	
banks	 and	special	 purpose	 banks,	 all	catego -
ries	of	banks 	reported 	higher 	net	commis -
sions	 received.	 What	 is	more,	 the	percentage	
increase 	in	the	year	under 	review 	was	rela-
tively	 homogeneous	 across	 most	 of	the	cate-
gories.	 The	4.6%	 increase	 in	net	commissions	
received 	by	domestic 	commercial 	banks,	Net commis-
sions received higher …… due, inter alia, to rising stock exchange turnover
Net commis-
sions received up in almost all categories of banks
5	This	 sharp	 reduction	 in	net	interest	 received	 recorded	
by	Landesbanken 	was	due	in	part	to	a	one-off 	effect	
compared	 with	 the	previous	 year.	 In	2009	 a	number	 of	
institutions 	did	not	service 	participation 	rights 	capital	
and	 hybrid	 capital;	 however,	 some	 of	them	 again	 made	
distributions	 as	expenditure	 in	respect	 of	these	 financial	
instruments	 in	2010.	 This	 special	 factor	 in	2009	 resulted	
from 	the	fulfilment 	of	European 	Commission 	require -
ments	 in	the	context	 of	EU	state	 aid	control	 procedures	
due	to	the	stabilisation	 measures	 taken	 by	the	owners	 of	
the	Landesbanken	 concerned	 and	 by	the	Financial	 Mar-
ket	Stabilisation 	Fund 	(Sonderfonds 	Finanzmarktsta 	bili-
sie	rung,	 SoFFin).
6	Conceptual	 change	 in	financial	 accounting	 as	a	result	
of	the	Act	Modernising 	Accounting 	Law: 	due	to	the	
amended	 accounting	 rules	 regarding	 own-account	 trad-
ing,	commissions	 paid	 and	commissions	 received	 in	con-
nection 	with	the	purchase 	and	sale	of	instruments 	for	
own-account 	trading 	are	no	longer 	posted 	in	net	com-
missions	 received	 but	must	 be	shown	 in	net	profit	 or	net	
loss	from	 the	trading	 portfolio.
7	According 	to	the	published 	annual 	reports, 	the	de-
crease 	recorded 	by	regional 	institutions 	of	credit 	coop -
eratives	 was	 due	 to	the	fact	 that	 the	exceptionally	 high

8	According	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 the	growth	
rates 	of	net	commissions 	received 	by	the	individual

the	wake	 of	the	financial	 crisis	 had	an	adverse	 impact	 on

Net profit or net loss from the trading 
portfolio
Despite 	a	decline 	in	net	income 	by	€1.2	bil-
lion,	 in	the	year	 under	 review	 German	 banks	
recorded	 a	substantial	 profit	 of	€5.7	 billion	 in	
own-account	 trading	 in	financial	 instruments	
and	precious 	metals.9	However, 	it	must 	be	
taken	 into	 account	 that	 the	year-on-year	 de-
cline	 in	profit	 is	also	 likely	 to	have	 been	 con-
siderably 	affected 	by	transfers 	to	the	special	
item10	pursuant 	to	section 	340e 	(4)	of	the

Although 	down 	on	the	previous 	year, 	the

were, 	according 	to	the	published 	annual 	re-
ports,	 characterised	 by	markedly	 heterogene -
ous	developments 	in	the	individual 	financial	
market 	segments. 	German 	banks 	generated

products	 and	 derivatives 	as	well	 as	from	 eq-
uity	transactions.	 Favourable	 global	 economic	
developments 	and	the	still	accommodative	
monetary	 policy	 stance	 in	the	euro	 area	 and	
other 	large 	economies 	probably 	contributed	
to	this	increase. 	According 	to	information	
provided 	by	the	institutions, 	given 	that	the	
Act	Modernising 	Accounting 	Law	was	man-
datorily	 applied	 for	the	first	 time,	 the	reclas -
sification 	of	net	interest 	received 	and	net	
commissions 	received 	in	connection 	with	
trading 	assets 	and	liabilities 	to	own-account	
trading 	figures 	provided 	an	additional 	posi-
tive	effect 	in	the	year	under 	review. 	By	con-
trast,	 primarily	 tensions	 in	the	markets	 for	the	sovereign	 bonds	 of	some	 euro-area	 countries	
are	likely	 to	have	 had	a	detrimental	 effect.
A	significant	 portion	 of	the	aggregate	 decline	
in	profits 	from 	own-account 	trading 	in	the	
year	 under	 review	 was	 attributable	 to	the	re-
gional	 banks,	 which	 sustained	 a	considerable	
reduction	 (-€0.6	 billion)	 in	own-account	 trad-
ing,	leading 	to	an	–	albeit 	minor 	–	own-ac -

own-account	 trading	 by	a	number	 of	institu -
tions 	because 	of	requirements 	connected	
with	 the	EU	state	 aid	control	 procedure.13	By	
contrast, 	the	big	banks 	were 	the	only	bank -
ing	category	 to	post	 a	year-on-year	 rise	in	net	
profits	 (by	10.4%	 to	€4.7	 billion)	 in	2010.	 Ac-
cording 	to	the	published 	annual 	reports,	
however,	 it	was	 due	only	 to	one	institution.14	
For	all	other 	banking 	groups, 	own-account	
trading	 played	 virtually	 no	role	in	the	report -
ing	year.
Administrative spending
After 	reaching 	the	highest 	level	so	far	(re-
corded	 in	2009),	 German	 banks’	 administra -
tive	spending	 fell	markedly	 again	 in	2010,	 by	
€2.0	billion 	or	2.4% 	to	€80.2 	billion.15	This	
was	due	to	an	even 	more 	pronounced 	drop	
in	staff	costs 	by	€2.7	billion 	or	6.0%, 	given	
that	 other	 administrative	 spending,	 which	 es-
sentially 	comprises 	material 	expenditure, 	ex-
penditure 	on	third-party 	services, 	as	well	as	
depreciation	 of	tangible	 fixed	 assets,	 rose	 by	
1.9% 	to	€38.0 	billion 	in	2010. 	According 	to	
the	published	 annual	 reports,	 a	large	 part	 of	
the	decline 	in	staff	costs 	in	the	year	under	
review	 was	 likely	 caused	 by	the	Act	Modern -
ising 	Accounting 	Law	being 	mandatorily 	ap-
plied	 for	the	first	time.	 This	 is	because,	 under	
the	new	rules, 	interest 	expense 	for	pension	
provisions	 is	no	longer	 to	be	reported	 under	
staff	 costs;	 for	this	reason,	 they	 were	 for	the	
most 	part	reported 	under 	other 	administra -
tive	spending. 	The	further 	decline 	in	the	
number	 of	persons	 employed	 in	the	banking	industry 	(641,450 	in	2010 	as	opposed	
to	646,650 	in	2009) 	is	also	likely 	to	have	
brought	 some	 relief.
On	the	whole,	 all	categories	 of	banks	 saw	 a	
slight 	to	considerable 	fall	in	administrative	
spending.	 With	 regard	 to	the	individual	 com-
ponents 	staff	costs 	and	other 	administrative

spending down as a result of lower staff costsMixed develop-ment across the categories of banks
13	EU	state	 aid	control	 procedures	 formed	 the	basis	 for	
the	granting 	of	financial 	assistance 	by	SoFFin 	and	the	
respective 	owners 	to	several 	Landesbanken 	during 	the	
financial	 crisis,	 and	were	 linked	 with	 far-reaching	 condi -
tions 	such 	as	the	requirement 	to	shrink 	balance 	sheets	
by	focusing 	more 	on	core	business 	lines, 	selling 	partici -
pating 	interests 	and	withdrawing 	from 	entire 	business	
lines	 including	 own-account	 trading.
14	According 	to	the	data	published 	by	this	institution,	
however, 	around 	half	of	the	year-on-year 	increase 	in	
own-account 	trading 	was	due	to	the	reclassification 	of	
net	interest 	income 	in	connection 	with	trading 	instru -
ments	 from	 net	interest	 received	 to	net	profit	 or	net	loss	
from 	the	trading 	portfolio, 	the	Act	Modernising 	Ac-
counting 	Law	having 	been 	mandatorily 	applied 	for	the	
first	time.	 According	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 by	
contrast	 all	other	 big	banks	 saw	 their	 own-account	 trad-
ing	results	 decline	 on	the	year.	 However,	 as	has	already	
been	 mentioned,	 transfers	 to	the	special	 item	 in	the	fund	
for	general	 banking	 risks	 had	a	considerable	 negative	 ef-
fect	at	one	big	bank.
15	Conceptual	 change	 in	financial	 accounting	 as	a	result	
of	the	Act	Modernising	 Accounting	 Law:	 under	 the	old	
rules, 	it	was	possible 	to	book 	transfers 	to	(pension 	and	
interest 	expense) 	and	income 	from 	the	release 	of	pen-
sion	provisions 	in	their 	entirety 	under 	staff	costs. 	(Ac-
cording	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 a	large	 number	
of	institutions	 seem	 to	have	 used	 this	booking	 practice	 in	
the	past.)	 On	the	other	 hand,	 it	was	 also	 possible	 to	re-
port	them 	separately, 	with	pension 	components 	being	
posted	 under	 staff	 costs	 and	 the	interest	 portion	 under	
net	interest	 income.	 Based	 on	the	new	 provisions	 of	the	
German 	Commercial 	Code, 	the	IDW	will	in	future 	re-
quire	 a	differentiated	 reporting.	 Thus,	 the	pension	 com-
ponent	 arising	 in	the	respective	 period	 is	to	be	reported	
under 	staff	costs. 	On	the	other 	hand, 	expenditure 	and	
income 	from 	marking 	up	or	discounting 	pension 	provi -
sions	 must	 be	netted	 with	 expenditure	 and	income	 from	
the	pension	 plan	 assets	 to	be	offset,	 and	reported	 as	part	
of	the	financial	 result.	 According	 to	the	published	 annual	
reports,	 this	balance	 was	 predominantly	 reported	 under	
other	 operating	 income.	 In	the	case	 of	effects	 on	profits	
caused	by	a	change	in	the	discount	rate	there	is	the	pos -
sibility 	of	booking 	these 	under 	either 	staff	costs 	or	the	
financial	 result.	 The	same	 applies	 to	current	 income	 and	
effects 	on	profits 	from 	changes 	in	the	fair	value 	of	the	
pension	 plan	 assets,	 unless	 they	 have	 already	 been	 net-
ted	with	expenditure 	and	revenue 	from 	marking 	up	or	
discounting	 pension	 provisions.	 However,	 the	disclosure	
option	 for	the	three	 aforementioned	 items	 must	 be	exer-
cised	 consistently.

nual	 reports,	 this	development	 probably	 also	
resulted, 	to	a	considerable 	extent, 	from 	the	
Act	Modernising	 Accounting	 Law	 being	 man-
datorily	 applied	 for	the	first	time.
In	the	year	 under	 review,	 credit	 cooperatives	
and	Landesbanken 	recorded 	a	perceptible	
deterioration 	of	net	other 	operating 	income	
or	charges, 	which 	resulted 	from 	a	sharp 	in-
crease 	in	charges 	paired 	with	only	slight	
growth 	in	income. 	The	main 	reason 	which	
the	Landesbanken 	cited 	in	their 	annual 	re-
ports 	was	the	above-mentioned 	new	rules	
under	 the	Act	Modernising	 Accounting	 Law.	
Big	banks	 likewise	 sustained	 a	distinct	 wors -
ening	 and	posted	 –	as	in	the	previous	 year	 –	a	
relatively	 high	 loss	in	net	other	 operating	 in-
come	 or	charges,18	which	 played	 a	major	 part	
in	the	aggregate	 negative	 balance.19	By	con-
trast,	 the	regional	 banks	 were	 the	only	 cate-
gory	 of	banks	 to	register	 a	perceptible	 growth	
in	net	other	 operating	 income	 or	charges.	 In	
the	case	of	most 	other 	categories 	of	banks,	
there 	were 	only	minor 	changes 	in	net	other	
operating	 income	 or	charges	 compared	 with	
the	previous	 year.
Operating result before the valuation  
of assets
In	the	2010	 financial	 year,	 the	German	 bank -
ing	industry 	again 	followed 	the	marked 	in-
crease 	in	their 	operating 	result 	before 	the	
valuation 	of	assets 	in	2009 	with	a	slight 	in-
crease 	of	€1.6	billion 	to	€45.7 	billion. 	This	
moderate	 growth	 was	largely	 due	to	reduced	
administrative 	spending 	and	to	higher 	gross	
income,20	and	more 	than 	offset 	the	drop 	in	profits	 on	own-account	 trading	 and	the	dete-
rioration 	in	net	other 	operating 	income 	or	
charges.
Looking	 at	the	individual	 categories	 of	banks,	
primarily 	the	savings 	banks, 	credit 	coopera -
tives 	and	regional 	banks 	recorded 	sharp	
growth 	in	their 	operating 	result 	before 	the	
valuation 	of	assets; 	this	growth 	was	largely	
fuelled 	by	perceptible 	increases 	in	their 	re-
spective	 net	interest	 income.	 By	contrast,	 the	
Landesbanken, 	big	banks 	and	regional 	insti-
tutions 	of	credit 	cooperatives 	sustained, 	in	
some	 cases,	 considerable	 drops	 in	their	 oper-
ating 	result 	before 	the	valuation 	of	assets.	
This	 was	 attributable	 to	a	pronounced	 reduc -
tion	 in	net	interest	 income	 at	big	banks	 and	
Landesbanken, 	and	above 	all	to	the	decline	
in	own-account	 trading	 figures	 at	regional	 in-
stitutions 	of	credit 	cooperatives. 	However,	
these 	three 	categories 	could 	at	least 	partly	
offset 	the	deterioration 	of	the	operating 	re-
sult	before	 the	valuation	 of	assets	 by	scaling	
back 	administrative 	spending. 	At	mortgage	
banks	 and	special	 purpose	 banks,	 the	operat -
ing	result	 before	 the	valuation	 of	assets	 more	
or	less	stabilised	 at	the	previous	 year’s	 level.Mixed develop-
ments between categories of banks

18	The	negative	 balance	 in	big	banks’	 net	other	 operat -
ing	income	 or	charges	 totalling	 -€2.6	 billion	 was,	 accord -
ing	to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 attributable	 to	two	
institutions;	 their	 losses	 were	 the	result,	 inter	 alia,	 of	the	
setting 	up	of	provisions, 	charges 	related 	to	currency	
hedging 	contracts 	in	connection 	with	foreign 	branches	
and	subsidiaries,	 net	charges	 resulting	 from	 transactions	
with	 commodities	 and	 commodity	 futures	 with	 physical	
delivery	 as	well	 as	the	costs	 of	capital	 increases.
19	In	the	year	 under	 review,	 apart	 from	 big	banks,	 only	
regional 	institutions 	of	credit 	cooperatives 	reported 	a	
loss	in	net	other 	operating 	income 	or	charges; 	at	€17

On	the	whole,	 German	 credit	 institutions	 suc-
ceeded 	in	improving 	cost	efficiency 	in	2010.	
The	ratio 	of	administrative 	spending 	to	the	
sum	 of	net	interest	 received	 and	net	commis -
sions 	received 	fell	by	2.8	percentage 	points	
to	66.4%. 	The	cost/income 	ratio 	relative 	to	
total 	income 	from 	operational 	business 	like-
wise	decreased, 	by	1.4	percentage 	points	
to	63.7%. 	Only 	in	the	case	of	the	Landes -
banken 	and	the	big	banks 	were 	both 	ratios	
clearly 	and	slightly, 	respectively, 	above 	the	
previous 	year’s 	level	in	the	2010 	financial	
year.	 Here,	 too,	 however,	 the	new	 rules	 under	
the	Act	Modernising 	Accounting 	Law	likely	
had	an	effect.
Net income or net charges from the 
v aluation of assets, and operating result
In	2010, 	German 	credit 	institutions’ 	net	
charges 	from 	the	valuation 	of	securities 	of	
the	liquidity	 reserve,	 claims	 and	loans	 showed	
a	further 	substantial 	fall	by	€11.5 	billion 	to	
€15.4 	billion, 	following 	massive 	increases 	in	
2007	 and	 2008	 and	 a	sharp	 decline	 the	fol-
lowing 	year.21	As	a	result, 	for	the	first	time	
since	 2006,	 risk	provisioning	 in	the	reporting	
year	 was	 again	 below	 the	long-term	 average	
for	the	years 	1993 	to	2009. 	Net	valuation	
charges	 in	relation	 to	the	balance	 sheet	 total	
likewise	 fell	clearly,	 to	0.19%,	 after	 0.34%	 in

resources	 of	€6.1	 billion	 were	 allocated	 to	the	
fund 	for	general 	banking 	risks	(pursuant 	to	
section 	340g 	of	the	German 	Commercial	
Code)	 in	the	reporting	 year;	 this	was	 the	sec-
ond-highest	 annual	 figure	 in	long-term	 com-
parison 	with	the	years 	1993 	to	2009. 	These	
resources	 do	not,	 however,	 reduce	 the	profit	
for	the	year	 in	the	performance	 analysis	 pre-
sented 	here, 	but	are	allocated 	to	the	appro -
priation	 of	profit	 as	part	 of	the	accumulation	
of	reserves.22
With	 the	exception	 of	the	credit	 cooperatives	
and	the	regional 	institutions 	of	credit 	coop -
eratives, 	whose 	risk	provisioning 	remained	
virtually 	unchanged, 	all	categories 	of	banks	
recorded 	a	decline 	in	their 	net	valuation	
charges	 compared	 with	 2009.	 Overall,	 the	re-
duction 	resulted 	primarily 	from 	the	reduced	net	valuation	 charges	 at	big	banks	 (-€3.6	 bil-
lion),	 Landesbanken	 (-€3.8	 billion),	 mortgage	
banks 	(-€1.1 	billion) 	and	special 	purpose	
banks	 (-€1.7	 billion).23
According 	to	published 	annual 	reports, 	net	
income	 or	charges	 from	 the	valuation	 of	the	
securities 	assigned 	to	the	liquidity 	reserve 	is	
likely 	to	have 	contributed 	to	a	marked 	de-
cline 	in	total 	net	valuation 	charges. 	Appar -
ently,	 the	overall	 effect	 of	the	very	 mixed	 de-
velopments	 in	the	individual	 financial	 markets	
on	net	valuation	 charges	 was	 positive	 in	the	
year	under 	review. 	German 	banks 	recorded	
income, 	above 	all,	from 	capital 	gains 	and	
write-ups, 	which 	were 	reflected 	in	part	in	a	
balanced 	valuation 	result 	or	even 	in	net	in-
come	 from	 securities	 business.	 A	major	 factor	
in	this	context	 was	 probably	 also	 the	further	
reduction 	of	write-downs 	on	fixed-income	
securities	 in	domestic	 credit	 institutions’	 port-
folios 	(down 	by	37.7% 	on	the	previous 	year	
and	therefore 	considerably 	below 	the	pre-
crisis 	level), 	which 	flowed 	in	part	into	the	
valuation 	result. 	According 	to	the	published	
annual 	reports, 	these 	positive 	effects 	con-
trasted 	with	in	some 	cases 	greater 	strains

– as	 has	been	 explained	 above	 –	contain	 the	net	trans -
fers	to	the	special	 item	 pursuant	 to	section	 340e	 (4)	of	
the	German	 Commercial	 Code.
23	In	the	categories	 big	banks	 and	Landesbanken,	 most	
institutions	 were	 able,	 according	 to	the	published	 annual	
reports, 	to	generate 	a	similar 	percentage 	increase 	of	
their 	valuation 	result; 	the	trend 	was	more 	mixed 	in	the	
case	 of	the	special	 purpose	 banks.	 According	 to	the	pub-
lished	 annual	 reports,	 two	institutions	 from	 this	category	
even	 reported	 a	net	income.	 The	improved	 result	 of	the	
mortgage 	banks 	category 	was	due	mainly 	to	one	large	
institution 	reducing 	its	net	valuation 	charges 	sharply.	
However, 	this	stood 	in	contrast 	with	a	marked 	increase	
in	risk	provisioning 	by	another 	institution 	which 	ac-
counted 	for	roughly 	three-fifths 	of	the	total 	risk	provi -
sioning 	by	mortgage 	banks 	in	2010, 	according 	to	the

broad-based	 global	 economic	 recovery24	from	
the	worldwide	 recession	 in	2009	 and,	 above

provisioning	 in	lending	 business	 that	 was	 ac-
tually 	set	up	in	2010 	was	in	some 	instances	
well	below 	original 	expectations 	due	to	the	surprisingly 	swift 	recovery 	made 	by	the	real	
economy.	 The	clearly	 more	 buoyant	 credit	 en-

billion 	in	2010, 	only	36% 	of	the	previous	
year’s 	figure,27	whereas 	doubtful 	debt 	of	
other 	debtors 	and	of	consumers 	went 	up	
slightly	 by	4.1 %	 to	€12.4	 billion	 and	by	8.2%	
to	€6.3	 billion	 respectively.
Although 	–	according 	to	the	published 	an-
nual	 reports	 –	general	 loan	 loss	provisions	 set	
up	in	the	past	were 	in	many 	cases 	written	
back 	in	the	year	under 	review, 	a	number 	of	
institutions	 (according	 to	their	 own	 informa -
tion) 	again 	stepped 	up	their 	provisions 	for	
potential 	future 	risks. 	Particular 	reference	
was	made 	in	this	connection 	to	real	estate	
financing 	in	several 	countries 	both 	within	
and	outside	 the	euro	 area.	 As	in	the	previous	
year, 	this	business 	area	was	burdened 	by	a	
rising	 number	 of	credit	 defaults	 and	a	drop	 in	
collateral	 value	 as	a	result	 of	falling	 property	
prices.
Owing	 to	the	substantial	 decline	 in	net	valu-
ation 	charges 	in	the	year	under 	review, 	the	
improvement 	in	the	operating 	result 	after	
valuation	 was	 significantly	 stronger	 than	 the	
increase	 in	the	operating	 result	 before	 valua -
tion. 	After 	a	negative 	figure 	in	2008 	and	a	
marked 	recovery 	in	2009, 	the	operating 	re-
sult	after	 valuation	 rose	 further	 on	aggregate	
in	2010	 (+€13.1	 billion)	 and	was,	 at	€30.3	 bil-
lion,	again 	well	above 	the	average 	for	the	
years	 1993	 to	2009	 (€19.3	 billion).
This	positive 	development 	in	the	operating	
result 	after 	valuation 	applied 	to	virtually 	all	
categories	 of	banks.	 Only	 the	regional	 institu -
tions 	of	credit 	cooperatives 	were 	unable 	to	
match 	their 	2009 	result. 	Even 	in	a	longer-
term	 comparison	 –	ie	in	relation	 to	the	period	from	 1993	 to	2009	 –	the	operating	 result	 af-
ter	valuation	 was	above	 the	respective	 longer-
term 	average 	for	almost 	all	categories 	of	
banks.	 Mortgage	 banks	 were	 the	only	 excep -
tion	due	to	the	fact	that	 risk	provisioning	 was	
still	comparatively	 high	 in	the	year	 under	 re-
view.28
Other and extraordinary income  
or charges
The	“extraordinary 	account” 	put	considera -
ble	strain 	on	the	performance 	of	German	
credit	 institutions	 in	2010,	 as	in	the	previous	
two	years, 	even 	though 	net	charges 	were	
substantially	 lower.	 Compared	 with	 the	previ -
ous	year, 	banks 	reduced 	net	losses 	by	€7.5	
billion	 to	€12.5	 billion.	 This	 was	 primarily	 the	
result	 of	a	steep	 decline	 in	net	charges	 in	fi-
nancial	 investment	 business	 by	€6.1	 billion	 to	
€2.4	billion. 	Relief 	was	also	provided 	by	the	
reduction 	of	net	extraordinary 	income 	and	
charges 	in	the	narrower 	definition29	by	€1.0	
billion	 to	-€4.3	 billion,	 although	 according	 to	
the	published	 annual	 reports,	 this	also	 partly

all categories 
of banks Despite reduced net losses, “extraordinary account” causes severe strains 
27	The	large 	stock 	of	problem 	loans 	in	2009 	was	due	
primarily	 to	numerous	 major	 insolvencies	 in	the	tourism,	
trade,	 clothing	 and	textiles	 sectors,	 as	well	 as	in	the	au-
tomotive 	industry, 	shipbuilding 	and	the	semiconductor	
segments.
28	According	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 the	mort -
gage 	banks’ 	operating 	result 	after 	valuation 	in	2010	
(-€15	 million)	 was	largely	 due	to	the	negative	 results	 of	a	
few	institutions 	which, 	for	the	most 	part, 	were 	also	re-
sponsible	 for	that	 banking	 category’s	 high	 risk	provision -

changed	 only	 slightly.30
The	reduced 	aggregate 	net	charges 	in	the	
“extraordinary 	account” 	compared 	with	the	
previous	 year	 were	 largely	 due	to	the	decline	
in	net	losses 	at	big	banks 	(by	€5.6	billion 	to	
€3.5	 billion),	 at	Landesbanken	 (by	€1.8	 billion	
to	€4.2	 billion)	 and	–	albeit	 to	a	far	lesser	 ex-
tent	 –	at	regional	 institutions	 of	credit	 coop -
eratives, 	credit 	cooperatives 	and	mortgage	
banks. 	At	big	banks, 	this	reduction 	was	
mainly 	caused 	by	a	pronounced 	decrease 	in	
write-downs	 in	financial	 investment	 business	
and	the	non-recurrence	 of	the	high	 extraordi -
nary	net	charges 	in	the	narrower 	definition	
from	 the	previous	 year.	 However,	 these	 posi-
tive	effects	 contrasted	 with	 an	increase	 in	net	loss	transfers.	 At	the	Landesbanken,	 the	de-
crease	 in	net	losses	 was	 also	 driven	 mainly	 by	
a	noticeable 	decline 	in	strains 	from 	financial

nition.31	The	fall	in	net	charges 	at	regional	
institutions 	of	credit 	cooperatives 	and	at	
credit 	cooperatives 	resulted 	primarily 	from	
considerably 	reduced 	write-downs 	in	finan -
cial	investment 	business. 	At	the	mortgage	
banks, 	on	the	other 	hand, 	the	year-on-year	
switch	 from	 net	charges	 to	net	income	 from	
loss	transfers 	had	the	effect 	of	reducing	
charges.	 Moreover,	 the	decline	 in	aggregated	
net	losses	 in	the	“extraordinary	 account”	 was	
attributable 	to	the	–	likewise 	comparatively	
slight 	–	improvement 	of	the	special 	purpose	
banks’	 net	result;	 this	was	 the	only	 category	
of	banks 	to	reverse 	a	net	loss	in	2009 	to	a	
small 	net	income 	thanks 	to	a	marked 	im-
provement	 in	financial	 investment	 business.
These	 loss-mitigating	 effects	 contrasted	 with	
an	increase	 in	net	losses	 in	the	“extraordinary	
account”	 of	savings	 banks	 (by	€0.6	 billion	 to	
€1.0	 billion)	 and	 regional	 banks	 (by	€0.2	 bil-
lion	to	€3.0 	billion). 	In	both 	categories 	of	
banks, 	this	was	driven 	by	higher 	extraordi -
nary	net	charges 	in	the	narrower 	definition.	
At	savings 	banks, 	moreover, 	higher 	write-
downs	 in	financial	 investment	 business	 com-
pared 	with	the	previous 	year	had	the	effect	
of	pushing	 up	charges.
Profit for the financial year, taxes  
on income and earnings, balance sheet 
profit
The	clearly	 improved	 operating	 result	 and	the	
perceptible	 reduction	 in	losses	 from	 the	“ex-
traordinary 	account” 	in	2010 	enabled 	Ger-
man	credit 	institutions 	to	post	a	strong 	in-
crease 	in	profit 	for	the	financial 	year	before	tax	vis-à-vis	 the	previous	 year	 by	€20.6	 billion	
to	€17.8	 billion.	 From	 a	longer-term	 perspec -
tive,	therefore, 	banks’ 	profitability 	showed	
signs 	of	a	tendency 	to	return 	to	normal 	on	
the	whole.	 Amounting	 to	0.22%	 and	5.17%	
respectively,	 the	aggregated	 return	 on	assets	
and	return 	on	capital 	–	before 	tax	in	each	
case	–	approximated 	their 	longer-term 	aver-
ages	 of	0.27%	 and	 8.06%	 respectively,	 ie	in	
relation 	to	the	period 	from 	1994 	to	2009.	
Profit 	for	the	financial 	year	before 	tax	was	
even 	substantially 	above 	the	corresponding	
longer-term	 average	 of	€15.1	 billion.
There 	was, 	for	the	most 	part, 	a	strong 	im-
provement 	in	the	annual 	result 	before 	tax	
across 	almost 	all	categories 	of	banks; 	yet	as	
in	the	previous	 year,	 there	 was	 also	 a	distinct	
spreading	 between	 the	annual	 results	 of	the	
individual	 categories	 of	banks.	 Sharp	 year-on-
year	 increases	 in	profit	 before	 tax	were	 regis -
tered	 by	the	special	 purpose	 banks	 (€3.4	 bil-
lion	after 	€1.5	billion),32	the	savings 	banks	
(€6.6	 billion	 after	 €4.7	 billion),	 the	credit	 co-
operatives	 (€4.8	 billion	 after	 €3.4	 billion)	 and	Savings banks 
and regional banks see net losses increase 
Strong 
improvement in earnings trend on aggregate, … … yet marked spreading in annual results both between and within individual cate-gories of banks 
31	Despite	 the	substantial	 decline	 in	net	losses,	 the	big	
banks 	and	Landesbanken 	–	along 	with	the	regional	
banks, 	which, 	however, 	traditionally 	post	high 	net	
charges	 due	to	profit	 transfers	 –	were	 (as	in	2009)	 largely	
responsible	 for	the	high	 aggregated	 total	 net	loss	in	the	
“extraordinary	 account”.	 According	 to	the	published	 an-
nual	reports, 	moreover, 	in	both 	categories 	of	banks	
these 	losses 	were 	driven 	–	as	in	the	previous 	year	–	by

the	regional 	banks33	(€1.1 	billion 	after 	€22	
million).	 By	contrast,	 of	the	banking	 catego -
ries	which	 had	posted	 pre-tax	 losses	 in	2009,	
only	 the	big	banks	 –	with	 the	highest	 increase	
in	the	annual 	result, 	in	terms 	of	amount, 	of	
all	categories 	of	banks 	–	again 	generated	
profits 	in	the	year	under 	review 	(€2.0 	billion	
after 	-€6.7 	billion). 	According 	to	the	pub-
lished 	annual 	reports, 	this	development 	was	
largely	 due	to	a	considerable	 year-on-year	 re-
duction 	of	the	losses 	of	one	institution. 	On	
the	other 	hand, 	the	Landesbanken 	–	al-
though 	they	likewise 	improved 	their 	annual	
result 	significantly 	–	again 	posted 	a	distinct	
loss	(-€0.9 	billion 	after 	-€5.2 	billion) 	which,	
according 	to	the	published 	annual 	reports,	
was	attributable 	to	two	institutions. 	The	
mortgage	 banks,	 too,	 improved	 their	 annual	
result	 considerably	 compared	 with	 the	previ -ous	year.	 Nevertheless,	 as	in	the	year	 before,	
they	 recorded	 an	–	albeit	 small	 –	loss	of	-€86

33	According	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 however,

34	According	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 the	reduc -
tion	of	the	annual 	loss	at	mortgage 	banks 	was	clearly

based 	improvement 	was	also	reflected 	in	
changes 	in	the	distribution 	of	the	return 	on	
assets 	before 	tax.	The	general 	year-on-year	
improvement 	in	the	annual 	results 	led	to	a	
“rightward	 shift”	 in	the	distribution.	 This	was	
shown	 both	 in	an	increase	 in	the	relative	 sizes	
of	all	profitability 	classes 	with	a	positive 	re-
turn	 on	assets	 –	except	 for	class	 0.3%	 to	be-
low	0.6%	 –	and	 in	a	shift	 within	 the	classes	
with	a	negative 	return 	on	assets 	from 	the	
two	 lowest	 classes	 to,	in	particular,	 the	class	
-0.3% 	to	below 	0%.	Moreover, 	the	number	
of	institutions 	with	a	negative 	return 	on	as-
sets	compared	 with	 2009	 fell	from	 66	to	55,	
and	their 	share 	of	the	aggregate 	balance	
sheet 	total 	of	the	German 	banking 	system	
contracted 	from 	30.3% 	to	20.6%; 	yet	this	
small	 group	 (3.1 %	 of	all	institutions)	 still	gen-
erated 	a	significant 	aggregate 	loss	of	€5.6	billion. 	In	contrast 	to	the	previous 	year,35	
however,	 the	annual	 losses	 by	this	compara -
tively	 small	 number	 of	fairly	 large	 institutions	
were	 clearly	 overcompensated	 by	the	pre-tax	
profits 	totalling 	€23.4 	billion 	generated 	by	
the	remaining 	banks 	(1,743 	institutions 	or	
96.9%	 of	all	banks),	 which	 accounted	 for	al-
most 	four-fifths 	of	the	aggregate 	balance	
sheet	 total.	 However,	 this	comparison,	 viewed	
in	connection	 with	 the	figures	 gathered	 from	
the	published	 annual	 reports,	 also	shows	 that	
the	burdens	 from	 the	financial	 and	economic	
crisis 	at	those 	institutions 	that	had	been 	es-
pecially 	hard 	hit	by	the	crisis 	due	to	their	
business 	model 	and	risk	profile 	had	still	not	
been	 fully	 overcome	 in	the	year	 under	 review.
As	a	result 	of	the	favourable 	profit 	trend 	in	
the	year	under 	review, 	taxes 	on	income 	and	
earnings	 increased	 by	€1.3	 billion	 to	€5.2	 bil-

istered 	significant 	tax	expenses. 	By	contrast,

both 	posted 	pre-tax 	annual 	losses, 	showed	
tax	receipts. 	After 	tax,	the	annual 	profit 	of

In	the	year	 under	 review,	 losses	 brought	 for-
ward 	of	€9.1	billion 	had	a	notable 	negative	
effect 	on	the	financial 	result 	(after 	€8.6 	bil-
lion	in	2009	 and	 €2.3	 billion	 in	2008).	 As	in	
2008	 and	2009,	 however,	 these	 were	 mostly	
accounted 	for	by	mortgage 	banks 	and	spe-
cial	purpose	 banks,	 and	within	 those	 catego -
ries	–	according 	to	the	published 	annual 	re-
ports	 –,	by	individual	 institutions	 in	each	 case.	
Further	 substantial	 strains	 stemmed	 from	 net	
transfers 	to	the	fund 	for	general 	banking	
risks36	totalling	 €6.1	 billion	 (after	 €2.1	 billion	
in	2009), 	which 	were 	the	result 	of	gross	
transfers 	of	€6.3 	billion 	and	withdrawals 	of	
€0.2 	billion. 	In	the	year	under 	review, 	net	
transfers 	at	savings 	banks 	(€2.2 	billion 	after	
€1.1	billion 	in	2009) 	and	at	credit 	coopera -
tives	(€1.1 	billion 	after 	€0.5	billion 	in	2009)	
were 	especially 	pronounced. 	These 	factors,	which 	had	a	negative 	effect 	on	the	result,	
contrasted	 with	 relatively	 small	 net	withdraw -
als	from	 reserves	 and	participation	 rights	 cap-
ital	in	the	amount	 of	€1.8	 billion	 (after	 €12.5	
billion 	in	2009 	and	€20.6 	billion 	in	2008).

€3.3 	billion. 	Overall, 	there 	remained 	an	ag-
gregate	 balance	 sheet	 loss	for	the	third	 year	
in	succession. 	However, 	at	€0.8 	billion, 	the	
loss	was	much 	lower 	than 	in	the	previous	
two	 years	 (€5.0	 billion	 in	2009	 and	 €4.8	 bil-
lion	in	2008).	 As	in	2009,	 the	aggregate	 bal-
ance 	sheet 	loss	was	largely 	due	to	balance	
sheet 	losses 	posted 	by	the	mortgage 	banks	
(€4.6 	billion 	after 	€4.7 	billion) 	and	special	
purpose	 banks	 (€1.2	 billion	 after	 €2.9	 billion),	
as	well	 as,	to	a	lesser	 extent,	 to	balance	 sheet	
losses	 generated	 by	the	regional	 banks	 (€0.5	
billion 	after 	€0.3 	billion) 	and	Landesbanken	
(€0.1 	billion 	after 	€2.3	billion). 	According 	to	
the	published 	annual 	reports, 	however, 	the	
negative 	financial 	results 	were 	largely 	con-
fined	 to	individual	 institutions	 (as	in	the	previ -
ous	year).	 By	contrast,	 all	other	 categories	 of	
banks 	showed 	an	aggregate 	balance 	sheet	
profit	 of	€5.6	 billion.
Outlook
The	first	quarter	 of	the	current	 financial	 year	
2011 	saw	a	sharp 	quarter-on-quarter 	im-
provement 	in	the	performance 	of	large 	Ger-
man	 internationally	 operating	 banks38	which	
report	 under	 the	IFRS	 and	 for	which	 consoli -
dated	 quarterly	 reports	 are	available.	 The	rea-
sons	 for	this	were	 a	continued	 moderate	 rise	
in	net	interest 	income 	after 	risk	provisioning	
and	a	clear	 increase	 in	own-account	 trading.	
In	the	latter 	case, 	however, 	the	result 	was	
dominated 	by	one	big	bank’s 	result. 	On	the	
whole, 	the	German 	banking 	groups 	almost	
tripled 	their 	aggregated 	quarterly 	pre-tax	
profit	 compared	 with	 the	previous	 quarter.In	the	second	 quarter,	 tensions	 on	the	finan -
cial	markets	 had	 an	increasing	 effect	 owing,	
above	 all,	to	the	public	 finance	 situation	 in	a	
number 	of	euro-area 	countries. 	These 	were	
evidenced,	 inter alia ,	by	an	–	on	the	whole	 –	
perceptible 	deterioration 	of	own-account	
trading 	figures 	and	by	considerable 	other	
losses 	on	financial 	instruments. 	In	this	con-
text,	high	write-downs 	on	Greek 	sovereign	
bonds39	at	a	number	 of	institutions	 probably	
also	played	 an	important	 role.	 Overall,	 aggre -
gated 	quarterly 	pre-tax 	profits 	were 	about	
40%	 down	 on	the	previous	 quarter.
The	intra-year	 group	 accounts	 are	not	repre -
sentative	 of	the	German	 banking	 system	 as	a	
whole	 in	terms	 of	the	type,	 scope,	 complexity	
and	riskiness	 of	the	respective	 business	 activi -
ties;	nevertheless, 	they	do	provide 	major	
clues	 as	to	the	German	 banking	 industry’s	 fu-
ture	performance. 	The	write-downs 	already	
visible 	in	the	consolidated 	accounts 	in	the	
first	half-year 	of	2011 	will	for	the	most 	part	
also	 lead	 to	impairments	 in	the	individual	 ac-
counts	 drawn	 up	in	accordance	 with	 the	Ger-
man	Commercial 	Code. 	This	is	true	both 	of	
the	group	 enterprises	 already	 considered	 and

ance 	sheets. 	Moreover, 	additional 	impair -
ments 	in	securities 	activities 	are	to	be	ex-
pected 	given, 	in	particular, 	the	growing 	un-
certainty 	over	how	the	European 	debt 	crisis	
will	develop	 in	future	 and	the	associated	 ten-
sions 	on	the	international 	financial 	markets.	
Above 	all,	this	will	probably 	affect 	own-
account 	trading 	and	the	securities 	of	the	li-
quidity	 reserve.
Developments 	in	risk	provisioning 	in	lending	
business 	in	the	2011 	financial 	year	are	likely 	to	
be	shaped, 	above 	all,	by	two	opposing 	fac-
tors.	In	domestic 	lending 	business, 	given 	the	
ongoing 	positive 	economic 	developments 	in	
Germany, 	the	improvement 	in	credit 	quality 	is	
expected 	to	continue, 	with	the	result 	that	risk	
provisioning	 in	domestic	 lending	 business	 is	
likely 	to	decline 	further 	with	a	slight 	time	lag	
to	real	 economic	 developments.40	However,	
the	underlying 	economic 	trend 	could 	slow	
down 	towards 	the	end	of	2011 	as	a	result 	of	
the	foreseeable 	weakening 	of	foreign 	de-
mand 	and	the	heightened 	uncertainty 	fuelled	
by	the	current 	situation 	on	the	financial 	mar-
kets	and	so	possibly 	–	with	a	certain 	time	lag	
–	lead	to	a	lessening 	of	the	reduction 	of	risk	
provisions. 	The	overall 	reduction 	in	charges 	in	
domestic 	lending 	business 	will	probably 	con-
trast	with	an	increase 	in	risk	provisioning 	in	
foreign 	lending 	business, 	however. 	Higher	
risks	may	be	expected 	in	lending 	to	the	for-
eign	private 	sector, 	in	particular 	due	to	the	
slowdown 	in	global 	economic 	activity 	and	the	
persistently 	difficult 	situation 	on	a	number 	of	
real	estate 	markets 	both 	within 	and	outside	
the	euro	area. 	Furthermore, 	the	financing 	of	
European 	peripheral 	countries 	continues 	to	
entail 	heightened 	credit 	risk.Earnings	 potential	 in	interest	 business	 is	likely	
to	remain 	fairly 	limited 	in	the	2011 	financial	
year	 due	to	the	countervailing	 movements	 of	
margins 	and	volumes. 	Growing 	volumes 	in	
domestic	 lending	 business	 driven,	 in	particu -
lar,	by	the	robust	 underlying	 economic	 trend	
in	Germany	 –	which	 may	 slow	 down	 towards	
the	end	 of	the	year,	 however	 –	are	expected	
to	have 	the	effect 	of	increasing 	banks’ 	re-
sults. 	Yet	this	development 	will	probably 	be	
countered 	by	a	flattening 	of	the	yield 	curve	
on	the	whole,	 which	 is	likely	 to	have	 the	ef-
fect	of	reducing 	earnings.41	Moreover, 	not	
least 	in	the	light	of	the	regulatory 	debate	
concerning 	the	bank-specific 	liquidity 	ratios	
under 	Basel 	III,	competition 	for	deposits 	in	
the	non-financial 	sector 	can	be	expected 	to	
continue	 in	future;	 this,	 in	itself,	 may	 have	 an	
adverse	 effect	 on	the	interest	 margin.
Commission	 business	 is	likely	 to	benefit	 from	
the	positive 	economic 	developments 	in	Ger-
many 	to	date. 	However, 	given 	the	growing	
uncertainty 	on	the	financial 	markets, 	future	
earnings	 potential	 is	likely	 to	remain	 limited.

observed. 	Moreover, 	this	has	been 	accompanied 	by	a	
clear	downward	shift	since	July,	with	interest	rates	at	the	
short	 end	 falling	 less	sharply	 than	 long-term	 yields.	 The	
reduction 	in	the	long-term 	segment 	at	the	current 	end	
was	 probably	 due,	 inter	 alia,	 to	the	slowdown	 in	global	
growth 	as	well	as	to	safe-haven 	inflows. 	Although 	the	
forward 	curve 	indicates 	a	slight 	steepening 	for	the	re-

trading 	portfolio), 	foreign 	exchange 	and	precious

balance-sheet	 trading	 assets	 and	 trading	 liabilities	
were 	not	reported 	as	separate 	balance 	sheet	
items,	 but	were	 a	not	specifically	 mentioned	 com-
ponent	 of	the	respective	 instrument	 categories	 in	
accordance 	with	the	balance 	sheet 	form 	of	the	
Credit 	Institution 	Accounting 	Regulation 	(Ver-
ordnung über die Rechnungslegung der Kredit -
institute) .45	Off-balance-sheet 	trading 	assets 	and	
liabilities	 (eg	derivative	 financial	 instruments)	 were	
subject 	to	the	accounting 	principles 	for	open	
transactions	 and	therefore 	were 	not	to	be	recog -
nised.46
Trading	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 were	 to	be	measured	
pursuant 	to	the	measurement 	applicable 	to	cur-
rent	 assets.	 Thus,	 the	strict	 lower	 of	cost	 or	market	
principle	 applied	 (obligation	 to	write	 off	in	case	 of	
permanent	 and	temporary	 decreases	 in	value;	 op-
tion	to	write	 off	in	case	 of	expected	 fluctuations	 in	
value).
New	 rules
Own-account 	trading 	activities 	are	defined 	as	
transactions 	with	financial 	instruments47	in	the	
trading	 portfolio48	and	trading	 with	 precious	 met-
als.	The	trading 	assets 	and	liabilities 	which 	are	
classified	 under	 the	balance-sheet	 trading	 portfo -
lio	are	to	be	reported	 unnetted	 (mandatory	 gross	
value)	 in	the	new	 balance	 sheet	 items	 referring	 to	
the	trading	 portfolio	 (assets	 6a	and	 liabilities	 3b).	
In	this	context, 	contrary 	to	the	previous 	rule,	all	
derivatives	 bought	 for	trading	 purposes	 must	 also	
be	accounted 	with	their 	positive 	or	negative 	fair	
value;	 thus, 	at	this	point 	the	principle 	of	not	rec-
ognising	 open	 transactions	 is	partially	 breached.Pursuant	 to	the	new	 special	 provision	 for	credit	 in-
stitutions 	(section 	340e 	(3)	of	the	German 	Com -
mercial	 Code),	 trading	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	to	
be	measured 	initially 	at	cost	of	purchase 	and	at	
fair	value49	minus	 a	risk	haircut	 (for	trading	 assets)	
and	plus	 a	risk	haircut	 (for	trading	 liabilities)	 in	the	
subsequent	 measurement.	 The	new	 provision	 thus	
represents 	a	legally 	regulated 	exception 	to	the	
measurement 	at	strict 	lower 	of	cost	or	market	
principle,	 as	unrealised	 valuation	 income	 can	now

from 	own-account 	trading 	(eg	the	reclassification 	of	
trading 	portfolio 	securities 	to	securities 	of	the	liquidity	
reserve 	or	financial 	investment 	portfolio 	and	vice	versa)	
was	permitted 	in	principle, 	if	the	purpose 	to	be	carried	
out	autonomously 	by	the	respective 	credit 	institution	
was	 not	changed	 arbitrarily.
46	According	 to	the	old	accounting	 rules,	 open	 transac -
tions 	had	to	be	recognised 	only	in	case	of	impending	
losses.	 Realised	 profits	 and	losses	 from	 on-balance-sheet	
and	off-balance-sheet 	transactions 	in	the	trading 	port-
folio	 were	 to	be	recorded	 in	net	profit	 or	loss	on	financial	
operations.
47	The	German 	Commercial 	Code 	does	 not	provide 	an	
explicit 	definition 	for	the	term 	“financial 	instrument”	
owing	 to	the	variety	 of	and	continuous	 developments	 in	
these 	instruments. 	However, 	based 	on	the	correspond -
ing	definitions	 in	the	German	 Banking	 Act	(Gesetz	 über	
das	Kreditwesen) 	and	the	Securities 	Trading 	Act	(Wert -
papierhandelsgesetz), 	derivates, 	money 	market 	instru -
ments,	 foreign	 exchange,	 securities	 and	 liabilities	 which	
are	issued	 and	repurchased	 in	the	short	 term	 can	be	in-
cluded	 in	the	financial	 instruments	 category.
48	All	financial 	instruments 	and	precious 	metals 	are	to	
be	attributed 	to	the	trading 	portfolio 	which 	are	pur-
chased	 and	sold	 with	 the	intention	 of	generating	 a	profit	
for	own	account 	in	the	short 	term. 	A	reclassification	
from 	the	financial 	investment 	portfolio 	or	of	securities	
from 	the	liquidity 	reserve 	to	the	trading 	portfolio 	is	no	
longer 	permitted. 	A	reclassification 	from 	the	trading	
portfolio	 to	the	financial	 investment	 portfolio	 or	for	se-
curities	 alternatively	 to	the	liquidity	 reserve	 is	only	 possi -
ble	in	exceptional 	circumstances. 	In	particular, 	these	
could 	be	underlying 	market 	disruptions, 	such 	as	the	fi-
nancial 	crisis 	in	2008, 	which 	lead	to	severe 	constraints	
on	the	tradability	 of	the	financial	 instruments	 concerned.	
By	contrast,	 a	pure	 slump	 in	prices	 does	 not	restrain	 trad-
ability 	and	therefore 	does 	not	justify 	a	reclassification.	
Therefore, 	reclassifications 	aimed 	at	smoothing 	the	an-
nual	 results	 are	ruled	 out.
49	However,	 even	 before	 the	Act	Modernising	 Account	
Law	was	introduced, 	some 	large 	banks 	interpreted 	the	
Generally 	Accepted 	German 	Accounting 	Principles	
(Grund	 sätze	 ordnungsmäßiger	 Buchführung,	 GoB)	 such	
that	 the	financial	 instruments	 in	their	 trading	 portfolios	
were	 stated	 at	fair	value.DEUTSCHE

also	be	recognised 	along 	with	realised 	income 	as	
part	 of	the	subsequent	 measurement.
In	the	context 	of	the	subsequent 	valuation, 	the	
fair	value	 is	to	be	determined	 in	accordance	 with	
the	following	 measurement	 hierarchy	 –	if	there	 is	
an	active 	market 	at	the	time	of	recognition, 	the	
fair	value	 is	equivalent	 to	the	market	 price	 (mark-
to-market). 	If	there 	is	no	active 	market, 	the	fair	
value	 is	to	be	determined	 using	 generally	 accepted	
valuation 	models 	(eg	cash	value 	or	option 	price	
models	 (mark-to-model).	 If	there	 is	no	active	 mar-
ket	and	if,	in	addition,	 a	reliable	 measurement	 us-
ing	generally 	accepted 	valuation 	models 	is	not	
possible, 	the	subsequent 	measurement 	must 	be	
carried 	out	at	amortised 	cost, 	with	the	fair	value	
that	 was	 last	determined	 deemed	 to	be	the	amor -
tised	 cost.
The	haircut 	(risk	surcharge) 	to	be	applied 	to	the	
fair	value 	of	the	trading 	assets 	(trading 	liabilities)	
should	 take	 account	 of	the	probabilities	 of	default	
of	the	unrealised 	gains 	(losses), 	and	thus	reflects	
the	negative	 effects	 from	 latent	 asset	 depreciation	
risks	(asset 	appreciation 	risks	for	liabilities).50	Al-
though	 the	law	does	 not	contain 	any	regulations	
for	calculation 	of	the	haircut 	(risk	surcharge),	
value-at-risk	 (VaR)	51	haircuts,	 which	 are	calculated	
taking	 into	 account	 the	prudential	 supervisory	 pa-
rameters,	 can	be	viewed	 as	a	possible	 alternative,	
as	legislators	 assume	 that	 banking	 supervisors	 will	
monitor 	the	suitability 	of	the	calculation 	method	
and	calculation	 parameters	 used	 to	determine	 the	
risk	surcharge.	 Institutions	 which	 do	not	calculate	
a	VAR	for	prudential 	purposes 	can	use	a	VAR	to	
calculate	 the	haircut	 (risk	 surcharge)	 if	it	is	in	line	
with	 internal	 management,	 or	they	 can	use	alter-
native	 calculation	 processes	 if	they	 are	in	line	with	
internal 	risk	management 	(eg	haircut 	in	the	
amount 	of	unrealised 	earnings). 	The	haircut 	(risk	surcharge)	 is	also	 to	be	made	 if	this	leads	 to	a	loss	
for	the	year	for	the	respective 	institution 	as	a	
whole 	or	an	already 	existing 	loss	for	the	year	is	
increased.
In	order	 to	take	 due	account	 of	the	HGB	 principle	
of	prudence 	and	to	compensate 	–	partially 	–	for	
breaching	 the	realisation	 principle	 through	 the	fair	
value 	valuation, 	the	new	German 	Commercial	
Code 	requires 	a	countercyclical 	risk	reserve 	to	be	
set	up	in	addition	 to	the	risk	haircut.	 This	 is	to	be	
indicated 	separately 	pursuant 	to	section 	340e 	(4)	
of	the	German	 Commercial	 Code	 as	a	special	 item	
in	the	fund	 for	general	 banking	 risks	 pursuant	 to	
section	 340g	 of	the	German	 Commercial	 Code.	 In	
order	 to	set	up	this	special	 item,	 in	every	 financial	
year	 with	 a	positive	 trading	 result	 at	least	 10%	 of	
the	net	income 	from 	the	trading 	portfolio 	(after	
the	risk	haircut)	 is	to	be	transferred	 to	the	risk	re-
serve.52	This	 transfer	 must	 be	made	 until	 the	spe-
cial	item	 has	reached	 a	volume	 of	50%	 of	the	av-
erage	 net	income	 (after	 the	haircut)	 of	the	last	five	
financial	 years	 with	 a	positive	 trading	 result;	 in	the	
case	 of	net	income	 from	 the	trading	 portfolio,	 the	
transfer	 must	 also	be	made	 irrespective	 of	whether	
a	loss	for	the	financial	 year	 arises	 for	the	respective	
institution	 as	a	whole	 or	an	already	 existing	 annual	
loss	is	increased.	 The	special	 item	 can	only	 be	dis-

ations.54	Realised	 price	 losses,	 write-downs	 due	to	
valuation	 losses	 and	transfers	 to	provisions	 for	im-

valuation 	gains 	(upper 	limit: 	amortisation 	cost)	
and	revenue	 from	 the	release	 of	provisions	 for	im-
pending	 losses	 were	 booked	 under	 revenue	 com-
ponents.	 It	was	 not	admissible	 to	record	 any	cur-
rent	revenue 	and	expenditure 	(eg	interest, 	divi-
dends, 	commissions) 	from 	trading 	assets 	in	net	
profit	 or	net	loss	on	financial	 operations.55
New	 rules
Revenue 	and	expenditure 	generated 	in	own-
account 	trading 	are	netted 	and	reported 	in	net	in-
come 	or	net	expenditure 	from 	the	trading 	portfo -
lio.56	Both 	realised 	and	unrealised 	price 	or	valuation	
losses 	are	included 	as	expenditure 	components.	
Realised 	and	unrealised 	price 	or	valuation 	profits,	
which 	can	also	exceed 	the	cost	of	purchase 	in	fu-
ture, 	are	to	be	included 	as	income 	components.
Furthermore,	 contrary	 to	the	old	rule,	 the	current	
revenue	 and	 expenditure	 from	 trading	 assets	 and	liabilities	 are	reported	 in	net	profit	 or	net	loss	from	
the	trading	 portfolio,	 if	this	is	in	line	with	 internal	
control57	for	calculating 	the	operating 	results.	
Thus, 	interest 	received 	and	current 	income 	from	
trading	 assets	 and	 interest	 paid	 for	trading	 liabili -
ties,	which 	serve 	to	refinance 	trading 	assets, 	are	
now	generally 	booked 	in	net	profit 	or	net	loss	
from	 the	trading	 portfolio.58	In	addition,	 deviating	
from 	previous 	booking 	practices, 	commissions	
paid	 and	commissions	 received	 in	connection	 with	
the	purchase	 and	sale	of	own-account	 trading	 in-
struments 	must 	be	reported 	in	net	profit 	or	net

There 	are	no	specific 	legal 	requirements 	for	the	
treatment 	in	the	profit 	and	loss	account 	of	ex-
penses	 resulting	 from	 transfers	 to	the	special	 item

54	All	expenditure	 and	revenue	 had	to	be	netted	 against

56	All	expenditure	 and	revenue	 from	 the	trading	 portfo -

recommends 	booking 	income 	from 	withdrawals	
from	 the	special	 item	 as	an	income	 component	 in	
net	profit 	or	net	loss	from 	the	trading 	portfolio.	
This	accounting 	approach 	cannot 	readily 	be	ap-
plied 	to	expenses 	resulting 	from 	transfers 	to	the	
special 	item. 	Alternatively, 	these 	can	also	be	re-
corded	 in	the	expense	 item	 in	which	 the	transfers	
to	the	fund 	for	general 	banking 	risks	are	to	be	
shown.	 However,	 the	IDW	 suggests	 that,	 for	pur-
poses	 of	consistent	 reporting,	 the	expenses	 result -
ing	from 	transfers 	to	the	special 	item	should 	be	
booked	 along	 with	 income	 from	 withdrawals	 from	
the	special	 item	 in	net	profit	 or	net	loss	from	 the	
trading	 portfolio.59
According	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	 the	re-
porting 	credit 	institutions 	have 	largely 	followed	
the	IDW’s	 proposal	 with	 regard	 to	booking	 trans -
fers	to	the	fund 	for	general 	banking 	risks	which	
relate 	to	the	special 	item, 	and	for	the	reporting	
year	 2010	 have	 booked	 these	 as	expense	 compo -
nents 	in	net	income 	from 	the	trading 	portfolio.	
Accordingly,	 they	 are	also	 included	 in	the	item	 net	
income	 or	net	expenditure	 from	 the	trading	 port-
folio	in	the	Bundesbank’s 	statistics 	of	the	banks’	
profit	 and	loss	accounts.	 However,	 this	type	 of	ac-
counting 	partially 	contravenes 	the	Bundesbank’s	
present 	methodology 	for	booking 	transfers 	to	or	
withdrawals 	from 	the	fund 	for	general 	banking	
risks; 	in	the	past, 	all	transfers 	to	or	withdrawals	
from 	the	fund 	for	general 	banking 	risks	have 	al-
ways	 been	 booked	 as	appropriation	 of	profit	 and	
not	as	expense 	or	income 	components. 	It	is	cur-
rently	 not	possible	 to	adapt	 the	present	 methodol -
ogy	and	apply	 it	to	the	special	 item,	 as	the	present	
database 	does 	not	allow 	a	reliable 	adjustment 	of	
net	profit	 or	net	loss	from	 the	trading	 portfolio	 for

porting).	 The	measurement	 of	the	pension	 assets,	
which 	were 	indistinguishable 	components 	of	the	
respective	 balance	 sheet	 items	 on	the	assets	 side,	
was	 carried	 out	on	the	basis	 of	the	lower	 of	cost	
or	market 	principle. 	Pension 	obligations 	were 	to	
be	stated	 at	present	 value	 for	current	 pension	 ob-
ligations 	and	obligations 	to	former 	employees.	
Pension	 entitlements	 of	claimants	 employed	 in	the	
company	 were	 valued	 using	 the	entry	 age	normal	
method.62	A	general 	discount 	rate	range 	of	3%	
to	6%	was	 envisaged	 for	the	valuation	 procedure;	
a	range	 of	4%	to	4.5%	 was	 usually	 applied	 as	the	
discount 	rate	in	past	years. 	The	valuation 	thresh -
old	for	pension 	provisions 	was	the	value 	deter -
mined	 according	 to	the	entry	 age	normal	 method	
(pursuant	 to	section	 6a	of	the	Income	 Tax	Act	(Ein-
kommensteuergesetz) )	with	a	discount 	rate	of	
6%.
New	 rules
Pension	 obligations	 are	to	be	reported	 as	pension	
provisions 	on	the	liabilities 	side	of	the	balance	
sheet.63	If	there 	are	plan	assets,64	(Deckungsver -
mögen )	in	contrast	 to	the	old	regulation,	 company	
pension	 provisions 	must	 be	netted 	with	 them, 	so	
that	only	the	difference 	has	to	be	reported. 	An	
excess 	of	liabilities 	remaining 	after 	the	netting 	of	
company 	provisions 	and	plan	assets 	is	to	be	re-
ported	 as	provisions;	 an	excess	 of	assets,	 however,	
is	to	be	booked	 in	a	special	 item.
Plan	 assets	 are	to	be	valued	 at	fair	value.65	Latterly,	
the	valuation	 of	pension	 provisions	 is	based	 on	the	
“amount	 required	 to	settle	 the	obligation”	 (Erfül -
lungsbetrag) ,	which	 is	set	according	 to	reasonable	
commercial	 judgement.	 Consequently,	 future	 price	
and	cost	increases 	as	well	as	wage, 	salary 	and	
pension 	trends 	must 	be	taken 	into	consideration	
for	the	valuation 	of	pension 	provisions. 	If	the	re-sidual 	maturity 	of	the	pension 	provisions 	exceeds	
one	year, 	these 	are	to	be	discounted 	at	the	aver-
age	market 	interest 	rate	of	the	last	seven 	years,	
according 	to	their 	residual 	maturity. 	Alternatively,	
disregarding	 the	principle	 of	individual	 valuation,	 it	
is	permissible 	to	discount 	all	pension 	provisions	
with	 the	average	 market	 interest	 rate	 that	 results	
assuming	 a	residual	 maturity	 of	15	years.66	Current	
pension	 obligations	 and	obligations	 to	former	 em-
ployees	 are	to	be	stated	 at	present	 value.	 For	the	
valuation	 of	pension	 entitlements	 of	staff	 currently	
employed 	in	the	company, 	all	actuarial 	methods	
can	be	applied	 which	 ensure	 that	 the	pension	 ex-
penditure	 is	spread	 over	 the	time	 period	 in	which	
the	employee 	entitled 	to	a	pension 	pays	his/her	
contributions 	(eg	modified 	entry 	age	normal	
method,	 projected	 unit	 credit	 (PUC)	 method).
Obligation to 
offset pension reserves and corresponding plan assets 
Valuation of 
plan assets at fair value, company pension provi-sions at the “amount required to settle the  obligation” 62	The	entry 	age	normal 	method 	requires 	that	the	ex-
penditure 	for	the	formation 	of	company 	pension 	provi -
sions	 for	active	 employees	 is	distributed	 evenly	 over	 the	
entire	 period	 of	service	 by	using	 a	theoretical	 premium.	
The	entry 	age	value 	(amount 	of	provisions 	at	a	given	
time	 during	 the	period	 of	accrual)	 of	a	company	 pension	
provision 	is	defined 	as	the	present 	value 	of	future 	pen-
sion	 benefits	 minus	 the	present	 value	 of	outstanding	 un-
changing	 annual	 contributions;	 these	 should	 be	defined	
in	such	 a	way	 that	 their	 present	 value	 at	the	beginning	
of	the	employment	 contract	 is	equal	 to	the	present	 value	
of	future	 pension	 benefits.
63	In	distinguishing	 between	 indirect	 and	direct	 pension	
obligations	 and	 the	regulations	 governing	 their	 balance	
sheet 	reporting 	on	the	liabilities 	side	(optional 	vs	com-
pulsory), 	there 	were 	no	changes 	in	comparison 	to	the	
“old”	 German	 Commercial	 Code	 (see	 footnote	 61).
64	The	new	 term	 plan	 assets	 has	been	 introduced	 with	
regard 	to	the	accounting 	of	pension 	assets. 	These 	are	
assets	 which	 are	beyond	 the	reach	 of	all	other	 creditors	
and	which 	are	used 	exclusively 	for	the	settlement 	of	
debts	 from	 pension	 obligations	 or	comparable	 long-term	
obligations.
65	See	comments	 on	the	valuation	 of	the	trading	 portfo -
lio	for	calculation	 of	the	fair	value.	 However,	 it	should	 be	
noted	 that	 for	the	fair	value	 of	plan	 assets,	 no	haircut	 is	
to	be	made	 on	the	fair	value,	 in	contrast	 to	the	trading	
portfolio. 	For	the	fair	value 	amount 	which 	exceeds 	the	
acquisition	 cost	 there	 is,	however,	 a	block	 on	payouts	 for	
plan	assets. 	The	company 	must 	therefore 	furnish 	proof	
of	retained	 earnings	 of	at	least	 that	 amount.

Disclosure in the profit and loss account
Old	rules
There	 were	 no	clear	 disclosure	 requirements	 under	
the	old	rules. 	Thus, 	on	the	one	hand, 	transfers	
(pension 	and	interest 	expenses) 	or	income 	from	
withdrawals	 from	 pension	 provisions	 could	 be	fully	
booked 	under 	staff	costs. 	On	the	other 	hand, 	it	
was	also	possible 	to	make 	a	separate 	booking 	of	
pension	 components	 under	 staff	 costs	 and	the	in-
terest	 portion	 under	 interest	 income.
New	 rules
On	the	basis 	of	the	new	German 	Commercial	
Code 	provisions, 	the	IDW	envisages 	a	more 	dif-
ferentiated 	reporting 	in	future. 	Thus 	salary 	ex-
penses, 	effects 	from 	changes 	in	salary, 	wage 	or	
pension 	trends 	and	the	biometric 	valuation 	pa-
rameters,67	changes 	in	the	total 	number 	of	per-
sons	with	pension 	entitlements 	and	changes 	in	
provisions	 in	connection	 with	 corporate	 restructur -
ings	 or	changes	 in	pension	 commitments	 are	to	be	
reported 	under 	staff	costs. 	Expenditure 	and	reve-
nue	from	the	compounding	or	discounting	of	pro -
visions	 are	to	be	netted	 with	 the	expenditure	 and	
revenue 	from 	plan	assets 	(which 	are	to	be	offset	
with	 provisions)	 and	shown	 as	part	 of	the	financial	
result;	 according	 to	the	published	 annual	 reports,	
this	balance	 was	 predominantly	 booked	 under	 the	
item	other 	operating 	income 	or	charges. 	Impacts	
on	profits 	from 	a	change 	in	the	discount 	interest	
rate	 can	be	booked	 either	 under	 staff	 costs	 or	un-
der	the	financial 	result. 	The	same 	applies 	to	cur-
rent	income 	and	impact 	on	profits 	from 	changes	
in	the	fair	value 	of	plan	assets, 	if	these 	have 	not	
already 	been 	offset 	against 	the	expenditure 	and	
income	 from	 the	compounding	 or	discounting	 of	
pension	 provisions.	 According	 to	the	IDW,	 the	dis-closure	 option	 for	the	three	 aforementioned	 items	
must	 be	exercised	 consistently.
Transitional	 arrangements
Necessary	 transfers	 to	existing	 pension	 obligations	
resulting 	from 	the	first-time 	application 	of	the	
new	measurement 	rules 	need 	not	be	transferred	
in	one	amount, 	but	can	be	accumulated 	in	por-
tions	 of	at	least	 one-fifteenth	 every	 financial	 year	
until	 31 December	 2024	 at	the	latest.	 The	transfer	
amounts 	to	be	recorded 	pro rata 	in	this	connec -
tion	are	to	be	recognised 	in	profit 	or	loss	in	the	
given 	year	and	to	be	recorded 	in	the	profit 	and	
loss	account 	under 	the	extraordinary 	expenses	
item. 	Excess 	amounts 	from 	the	overfunding 	of	
pension	 provisions	 resulting	 from	 the	first-time	 ap-
plication 	of	these 	new	measurement 	rules 	need	
not	be	withdrawn	 if	these	 amounts	 would	 have	 to	
be	transferred 	to	the	provisions 	again 	by	31 De -
cember	 2024	 at	the	latest.	 If	no	use	is	made	 of	this	
option, 	the	amounts 	resulting 	from 	the	with-
drawal	 are	to	be	appropriated	 directly,	 ie	without	
being	recognised	in	the	profit	and	loss	account,	to

Elimination of special reserves item
Old	rules
The	special 	reserves 	item	was	a	liability 	item	to	
which 	purely 	tax-related 	concessions 	and/or 	dis-
closure 	options 	within 	the	scope 	of	the	“reverse	
authority” 	or	“tax	dictates 	financial 	accounting”	
principle77	(Prinzip der umgekehrten Maß -
geblichkeit) 	were	 transferred	 from	 the	tax	balance	
sheet 	to	the	commercial 	balance 	sheet. 	Amounts	
appropriated 	to	this	special 	item	were 	not	taxed	
until	 their	 release.
New	 rules
As	the	“tax	dictates 	financial 	accounting” 	princi -
ple	was	repealed 	to	the	greatest 	possible 	extent	
with	 the	introduction	 of	the	Act	Modernising	 Ac-
counting 	Law, 	the	assumption 	of	purely 	tax	op-
tions	 in	the	commercial	 balance	 sheet	 is	no	longer	
permissible. 	It	is	therefore 	no	longer 	required 	to	set	up	a	special 	reserves 	item	in	the	annual 	ac-
counts.	 In	future,	 this	may	 not	be	newly	 set	up	or	
increased, 	so	that	the	expense 	item	“transfers 	to	
special	 reserves”	 and	the	income	 position	 “release	
of	the	special	 reserves	 item“	 have	 been	 deleted.
Transitional	 arrangements
A	special	 reserves	 item	 existing	 at	the	time	 of	the	
changeover 	to	the	Act	Modernising 	Accounting	
Law	 can	either	 be	dissolved	 or	retained.	 If	no	use	
is	made 	of	the	retention 	option, 	the	dissolution	
amount 	is	to	be	appropriated 	directly, 	ie	without	
being	recognised	in	the	profit	and	loss	account,	to	
retained	 profits.Special reserves 
item resulting from the “tax dictates financial accounting” principle 
Consequence 
of repeal of “tax dictates financial accounting” principle Retention option 
77	The	“authority	 principle”	 (Maßgeblichkeitsprinzip)	 or	
“commercial	 [financial]	 accounting	 dictates	 tax	account -
ing”	principle 	stipulates 	that	the	principles 	for	drawing	
up	the	commercial 	balance 	sheet 	also	apply 	to	the	tax	
balance	 sheet.	 However,	 if	options	 purely	 permissible	 in	
tax	law	were 	exercised 	in	the	tax	balance 	sheet, 	these	
had	to	be	transferred	 to	the	commercial	 balance	 sheet	 as	
part	 of	the	“reverse	 authority”	 or	“tax	 dictates	 financial	
accounting” 	principle. 	For	example, 	if	purely 	tax-
motivated	 (below	 the	HGB	 values)	 valuations	 were	 to	be	
transferred 	to	the	commercial 	balance 	sheet, 	this	could	
be	done 	by	means 	of	direct 	or	indirect 	write-downs. 	In	
the	case	 of	an	indirect	 write-down,	 the	tax-related	 write-
down 	amount 	had	to	be	booked 	under 	the	special 	re-
serves	 item	 and	liquidated	 according	 to	tax	law.	 The	HGB	
measurement	 on	the	assets	 side	 of	the	commercial	 bal-
ance	 sheet	 remained	 unchanged.DEUTSCHE

German banks’ lending to the domestic private 
sector since summer 2009
Credit 	growth 	continued 	to	decelerate 	up	to	and	into	the	first	quarter 	of	2010, 	bucking 	the	
economic	 recovery,	 which	 had	already	 begun	 in	spring	 2009.	 Annual	 growth	 of	lending	 to	the	
domestic	 private	 sector	 fell	by	around	 five	percentage	 points	 –	from	 3.8%	 to	-1.3%	 –	between	
its	peak	 in	July	2008	 and	its	nadir	 in	March	 2010.	 The	subsequent	 recovery	 was	 muted	 and	un-
even.	 This	 was	 caused	 chiefly	 by	weak	 growth	 of	loans	 to	enterprises,	 especially	 loans	 to	non-
financial	 corporations.	 On	the	other	 hand,	 loans	 to	households	 were	 already	 net	contributors	 to	
credit	 growth	 beginning	 in	autumn	 2009.
In	the	light	 of	the	financial	 crisis,	 this	raises	 the	question	 of	whether	 credit	 growth	 during	 the	
economic 	upturn, 	especially 	growth 	of	loans 	to	enterprises, 	may	be	classified 	as	exceptionally	
weak.	 However,	 a	detailed	 analysis	 of	the	available	 data,	 supported	 by	the	use	of	various	 statis -
tical	 and	econometric	 procedures,	 provides	 barely	 any	signs	 of	this	being	 the	case.	 One	 reason	
is	that,	 since	 the	beginning	 of	this	year,	 credit	 growth	 has	returned	 to	a	level	 corresponding	 to	
that	of	average 	growth 	since 	2002 	and	therefore 	is	not	unusually 	low	by	German 	standards.	
Another	 is	that	 the	lag	of	growth	 in	loans	 to	enterprises	 behind	 that	 of	gross	 domestic	 product	
(GDP) 	and	investment 	in	equipment 	observed 	during 	the	current 	upturn 	is	largely 	consistent	
with	 historical	 patterns.	 One	 crucial	 cause	 of	this	lag	is	apparently	 that,	 at	the	beginning	 of	an	
upturn,	 firms’	 improved	 profitability	 enables	 them	 to	meet	 their	 funding	 needs	 increasingly	 out	
of	their	 own	 resources	 to	start	 with.
The	results	 of	the	Bank	 Lending	 Survey	 (BLS)	 for	Germany,	 as	well	 as	those	 of	other	 surveys,	 in-
dicate	 that	 muted	 lending	 growth	 during	 the	economic	 upswing	 is	due	largely	 to	demand-side	
factors.	 Although	 econometric	 studies	 show	 that	 the	tension	 which	 struck	 the	financial	 markets	
in	summer 	2007 	and	banks’ 	subsequent 	financing 	and	liquidity 	problems 	made 	a	significant	
contribution	 to	the	deceleration	 in	the	growth	 of	loans	 to	non-financial	 corporations,	 particu -
larly	 in	the	year	 2009.	 It	is	not	possible,	 however,	 to	identify	 a	dampening	 of	credit	 growth	 by	
the	effects	 of	the	financial	 crisis	 past	 the	first	quarter	 of	2010.	 This	state	 of	affairs	 has	continued	
to	the	present:	 according	 to	BLS	data,	 which	 are	available	 up	to	the	second	 quarter	 of	2011,	 the	
sovereign	 debt	 crisis,	 too,	 has	so	far	failed	 to	leave	 any	noticeable	 mark	 on	German	 banks’	 lend-
ing	behaviour.DEUTSCHE

Introduction
The	bank 	loan	has	exceptional 	macroeco -
nomic 	importance 	in	Germany, 	for	two	rea-
sons.	 First,	 it	has	traditionally	 been	 domestic	
enterprises’ 	key	source 	of	external 	funding.	
Second, 	households 	borrow 	almost 	exclu -
sively	 from	 domestic	 banks.	 In	addition,	 bank	
lending	 to	the	private	 sector	 is	a	key	compo -
nent 	of	the	monetary 	transmission 	process.	
One	of	the	main 	objectives 	of	the	non-
standard	 monetary	 policy	 measures	 taken	 by	
the	Eurosystem	 in	the	aftermath	 of	the	finan -
cial	crisis	 is	therefore	 to	safeguard	 the	provi -
sion	of	liquidity 	to	banks 	in	order 	to	shield	
their	 lending	 to	private-sector	 enterprises	 and	
individuals	 from	 the	fallout	 of	tension	 in	the	
financial	 markets.
Developments	 in	lending	 to	the	private	 sector	
in	Germany 	during 	the	global 	financial 	crisis	
were 	already 	the	topic 	of	an	article 	in	the	
September 	2009 	edition 	of	the	Monthly Re -
port.	The	main	 concern	 at	the	time	 was	 that,	
in	the	early	 stages	 of	the	budding	 economic	
recovery 	process 	in	Germany, 	the	supply 	of	
bank	 credit	 could	 fall	short	 of	corporate	 bor-
rowing 	needs, 	thus	hindering 	the	upturn.	
Given 	the	surprising 	speed 	and	strength 	of	
Germany’s	 economic	 recovery	 from	 its	severe	
slump 	in	the	2008 	Q4-2009 	Q1	period, 	this	
concern 	proved 	unfounded. 	However, 	unse -
curitised	 loans	 to	the	domestic	 private	 sector	
did	not	show	 any	visible	 signs	 of	recovery	 un-
til	autumn 	2010. 	This	shifts 	the	discussion	
about	 the	existence	 of	a	credit	 crunch	 to	the	
question	 of	what	 caused	 weak	 credit	 growth	
during	 the	upswing.Annual 	growth 	of	lending 	to	the	domestic	
private	 sector	 in	Germany	 fell	by	around	 five	
percentage 	points 	–	from 	3.8% 	to	-1.3% 	–	
between	 its	peak	 in	July	2008	 and	its	nadir	 in	
March 	2010. 	The	subsequent 	recovery 	of	
credit 	growth 	was	muted 	and	uneven. 	Only	
as	2010	 was	coming	 to	a	close	 did	the	annual	
rate	 of	credit	 growth	 leave	 negative	 territory,	
returning	 to	the	corridor	 of	between	 0%	and	
2%	in	which 	it	had	fluctuated 	between 	the	
beginning 	of	2002 	and	the	end	of	2007. 	At	
around	 1 %,	 credit	 growth	 is	currently	 largely	
a	reflection 	of	average 	growth 	since 	2002	
and	thus	 cannot	 be	regarded	 as	being	 excep -
tionally	 low	by	German	 standards.
In	the	euro	 area,	 too,	 loans	 to	the	private	 sec-
tor	lagged	 the	economic	 recovery	 somewhat;	
the	credit 	cycle 	(in	terms 	of	annual 	growth	
rates) 	bottomed 	out	as	early 	as	October	
2009,	 six	months	 earlier	 than	 in	Germany.	 In	
addition, 	credit 	growth 	recovered 	more	
strongly	 in	the	euro	 area	 than	 in	Germany.	 At	
around 	2½% 	since 	the	beginning 	of	2011,	
euro-area 	credit 	growth, 	however, 	currently	
remains	 well	 below	 its	average	 from	 2002	 to	
the	present	 (just	 over	 6%).
It	was	primarily 	loans 	to	households 	–	most	
notably 	loans 	for	house 	purchase, 	which 	al-
ready	 began	 to	make	 noticeable	 positive	 con-
tributions 	again 	as	early 	as	autumn 	2009 	–	
that	 caused	 the	earlier	 and	stronger	 recovery	
of	credit	 growth	 in	the	euro	 area.	 By	contrast,	
loans 	to	non-financial 	corporations 	made 	a	
perceptibly 	negative 	contribution 	to	growth	
until	well	into	2010 	–	a	development 	which	
was	 visible	 in	Germany,	 too.Lending is a

Heterogeneous 	sectoral 	developments 	were	
behind	 the	tentative	 recovery	 of	loans	 to	the	
domestic 	private 	sector 	in	Germany. 	Unlike	
loans 	to	non-financial 	corporations, 	which	
contributed 	less	and	less	to	credit 	growth	
from 	as	early 	as	the	third 	quarter 	of	2008,	
loans 	to	non-monetary 	financial 	institutions	
continued 	to	grow 	dynamically 	up	until	the	
end	of	2009. 	This	caused 	loans 	to	financial	
corporations	 –	driven	 by	short-term	 loans	 to	
other 	financial 	intermediaries1	–	to	increas -
ingly 	become 	a	determinant 	of	the	continu -
ing	positive 	credit 	growth 	rates. 	However,	
this	development	 reversed	 itself	 in	2010	 and,	
amidst 	high	short-term 	volatility, 	loans 	to	fi-
nancial	 enterprises	 amplified,	 on	balance,	 the	
downward 	pressure 	on	aggregate 	credit	
growth 	imposed 	by	loans 	to	non-financial	
corporations.
Loans	 to	households	 were	 a	near-perfect	 mir-
ror	image:	 from	 early	 2007	 to	mid-2009	 their	
contributions 	to	growth 	were 	negative	
throughout 	but	then 	did	an	about-face 	into	
positive	 territory,	 thus	 counteracting	 the	neg-
ative	 trend	 in	loans	 to	enterprises.	 Whereas	 it	
was	consumer 	credit 	which 	was	initially 	re-
sponsible 	for	the	positive 	stimulus, 	from 	au-
tumn 	2009 	loans 	for	house 	purchase, 	too,	
showed 	an	increasingly 	positive 	develop -
ment. 	Their 	contribution 	to	aggregate	 credit	
growth 	rose	continuously 	and	stood 	at	one-
half	percentage 	point 	as	this	report 	went 	to	
press.
However,	 the	significance	 of	loans	 to	house -
holds	 for	aggregate	 credit	 growth	 considera -
bly	lagged 	that	of	loans 	to	enterprises 	until	
well	 into	 2010.	 Loans	 to	non-financial	 corpo -rations	 were	 the	main	 reason	 for	the	decline	
in	credit 	growth 	which 	lasted 	until	March	
2010	 and	for	the	sluggish	 pace	 of	the	subse -
quent	 recovery.	 This	 sub-category’s	 contribu -
tion	 to	growth	 fell	to	-1.2	 percentage	 points	
by	end-2009,	 began	 a	slow	 recovery	 from	 as	
late	as	May	 2010	 and	remained	 negative	 until	
the	beginning	 of	2011.Tentative

Loans to non-financial corporations
The	sharp 	decline 	in	loans 	to	non-financial	
corporations	 in	2009	 and	 the	ensuing	 tenta -
tive	recovery	 did	not	affect	 all	maturities,	 cat-
egories	 of	banks	 and	sectors	 equally.	 This	 de-
velopment 	was	driven 	in	key	measure 	by	
short-term	 loans	 with	 a	maturity	 of	one	year	
or	less,	 which	 became	 increasingly	 mired	 in	a	
slump	 from	 the	spring	 of	2009	 onwards	 and	
have 	only	recently 	started 	to	show 	signs 	of	
recovery.	 This	 is	likely	 to	be	due	 less	to	flag-
ging	 funding	 needs	 than	 to	the	fact	that	 en-
terprises, 	given 	the	rapid 	recovery 	of	aggre -
gate	output, 	were 	capable 	of	meeting 	their	
funding 	needs 	increasingly 	out	of	their 	own	
resources. 	For	medium-term 	maturities 	(be-
tween 	one	and	five	years), 	the	decline 	was	
much	 less	pronounced	 and	has	not	yet	come	
to	an	end.	 Only	 long-term	 loans	 with	 a	matu -
rity	of	over	 five	years	 have	 shown	 continuous	
growth; 	the	historically 	low	level	of	interest	
rates	 in	this	maturity	 segment	 is	probably	 one	
of	the	main	 reasons	 for	this.
A	breakdown 	of	loans 	to	non-financial 	cor-
porations	 by	economic	 sector	 reveals	 diverg -
ing	sector-specific	 developments.	 One	 factor	
to	blame 	for	the	negative 	growth 	of	aggre -
gate	 loans	 was	lending	 to	the	export-oriented	
manufacturing	 industry,	 the	growth	 contribu -
tions 	of	which 	have 	remained 	negative	
through	 to	the	present.	 The	decline	 affected	
all	sub-sectors	 of	manufacturing	 but	was	par-
ticularly 	pronounced 	in	the	manufacture 	of	
machinery	 and	 equipment	 and	 in	car	manu -

tries	and	to	all	sub-sectors 	that	fall	under	
wholesale	 and	retail	 trade.	 By	contrast,	 loans	
to	enterprises	 engaging	 in	energy	 and	 water	
supply,	 agriculture	 and	forestry,	 transport	 and	
construction	 rose	 –	not	least	 as	a	result	 of	the	
German 	Federal 	Government’s 	economic	
stimulus 	programmes. 	Their 	contribution 	to	
annual 	growth 	remained 	positive 	until	au-
tumn	 2010.
A	breakdown 	of	loans 	to	non-financial 	cor-
porations 	by	category 	of	bank 	likewise 	re-
veals	 clear	 differences	 (see	table	 on	page 64).	
Whereas 	savings 	banks 	and	cooperative	
banks	 made	 positive	 contributions	 to	annual	
growth	 rates	 of	loans	 to	non-financial	 corpo -
rations	 from	 as	early	 as	mid-2006	 throughout	
the	reporting	 period,	 Landesbanken	 continu -
ously 	scaled 	back 	their 	activity 	in	this	area	from 	September 	2009 	–	not	least 	owing 	to	
restructuring	 conditions2	imposed	 by	the	Eu-
ropean	 Commission	 in	the	wake	 of	the	crisis.	
This	 reduced	 the	contribution	 of	Landesbank	
lending 	to	loan	growth 	by	1.4	percentage	
points 	since 	October 	2009. 	Around 	half	a	
year	earlier, 	branches 	of	foreign 	banks 	had	
already 	begun	 to	reduce	 their	activity	 in	this	
segment,	 with	 big	banks	 and	 regional	 banks	
following	 suit	in	mid-2009.	 The	annual	 credit

to	non-financial 	corporations 	since 	the	end	
of	2010,	 big	banks	 have	 remained	 in	negative	
territory	 in	2011.
A	breakdown 	of	loans 	to	households 	by	cate-
gory	of	banks 	shows 	a	similar 	picture 	with	re-
gard	to	their	activities 	during 	the	crisis. 	Here,	
too,	loans 	were 	propped 	up	by	savings 	banks	
and	cooperative 	banks, 	whereas 	big	banks 	and	
mortgage 	banks 	scaled 	back	their	lending.
Credit growth in the business cycle
The	weak 	and	tenuous 	recovery 	of	loans 	to	
the	private 	sector 	during 	the	economic 	up-
turn	raises 	the	question 	of	whether 	this	can	
be	regarded	 as	an	aberration.	 A	comparison	
of	the	current 	situation 	with	earlier 	upturn	phases 	may	serve 	to	answer 	this	question.	
Time	 series	 methods	 –	for	instance,	 the	esti-
mation 	of	dynamic 	cross-correlations 	and	
cross-spectra 	–	can	be	used 	to	identify 	his-
torical 	patterns 	in	the	lead/lag 	structure 	of	
credit 	aggregates 	relative 	to	GDP	growth.	
Since	 the	correlation	 analysis	 and	the	spectral	
analysis	 provide	 different	 and	complementary	
information,	 the	results	 obtained	 using	 both	
procedures 	are	presented 	below. 	These 	re-
sults, 	of	course, 	cannot 	be	applied 	one-to-
one	to	current 	developments, 	since 	the	
econometric	 procedures	 are	restricted	 to	de-
velopments 	in	the	two	observed 	variables,	
while 	the	impact 	of	other 	factors 	is	disre -
garded.	 Nonetheless,	 the	results	 can	serve	 as	
valuable 	indicators 	of	potential 	deviations	
from	 the	credit	 growth	 that	 can	be	expected	
on	the	basis	 of	historical	 experience.Correlation

At	first	glance, 	the	(real) 	growth 	rates 	for

ilar	pattern 	to	the	GDP	growth 	cycle.3	The

however,	 reveals	 considerable	 differences	 be-
tween	 types	 of	loans	 in	terms	 of	the	intensity	
and	the	time	structure 	of	their 	correlation	
with 	the	business 	cycle. 	Loans 	to	non-
financial 	corporations 	show 	a	very	similar	
pattern 	to	the	business 	cycle 	and	are	highly	
correlated 	with	GDP	growth. 	By	contrast,	
growth	 of	both	 loans	 for	house	 purchase	 and	
consumer 	loans 	is	only	weakly 	correlated	
with	 GDP	 growth	 –	in	the	case	 of	consumer	
loans, 	this	has	become 	clear 	especially 	re-
cently. 	Growth 	of	loans 	to	financial 	enter -

between	 the	overall	 aggregate	 –	loans	 to	the

years),	 financial	 imbalances	 develop,	 whereas	
longer 	business 	cycles 	(seven 	to	nine	years),	
which	 often	 feature	 severe	 recessions	 and	fi-
nancial 	crises, 	are	associated 	with	a	drastic	
drop 	in	credit 	growth. 	Spectral 	analysis 	can	
be	used 	to	determine 	the	length 	and	shape	
of	credit 	cycles 	and	GDP	growth 	cycles, 	the	
strength	 of	their	 correlation	 and	 any	relative	
cycle	 shift.7
For	Germany, 	a	simple 	comparison 	of	aver-
age	real	annual 	growth 	rates 	of	loans 	and	
GDP	and	their 	standard 	deviations 	over	
longer	 periods	 is	enough	 to	demonstrate	 that	
credit 	growth 	is	much 	more 	volatile 	and,	at	
the	same 	time, 	is	higher, 	on	average, 	than	
GDP	 growth	 (see	table	 on	this	page).	 This	ob-
servation 	is	not	unique 	to	Germany 	but	is	
also	valid 	for	the	euro 	area	and	the	United	
States.8	This	is	confirmed 	by	spectral 	esti-
mates 	for	loans 	and	GDP	growth 	(see	table	
on	page 68).9	Credit	 cycles	 tend	 to	be	longer	
and	stronger 	than 	GDP	growth 	cycles, 	and	
can	be	shown	 to	be	closely	 correlated	 to	the	
latter 	(high 	coherence 	values). 	However, 	no	
credit 	boom 	has	been 	visible 	in	Germany 	in	
the	past	 decade;	 credit	 growth	 rates	 have	 re-
mained	 low	–	also	by	international	 standards.
With 	regard 	to	the	time	profile 	of	the	rela-
tionship 	between 	credit 	cycles 	and	business	
cycles,	 the	results	 of	the	spectral	 analysis	 are	
consistent	 with	 those	 of	the	dynamic	 correla -
tion	 analysis:	 loans	 to	households	 are	closely	
correlated 	to	consumer 	expenditure 	over	
medium-length 	cycles 	(five	years), 	signifi -
cantly	 leading	 the	latter	 by	three	 quarters.	 By	
contrast, 	the	sluggish 	growth 	of	consumer	
loans 	in	the	past	two	years 	has	tended 	to	parallel 	the	equally 	rather 	tentative 	recovery	
in	consumer	 expenditure.	 However,	 given	 the	
particular 	severity 	of	the	recession, 	the	cur-
rent	growth 	of	consumer 	loans 	does 	not	by	
any	means	 run	counter	 to	historical	 patterns.Credit growth

Loans 	for	house 	purchase 	lead	GDP	signifi -
cantly, 	by	three 	quarters. 	This	lead	can	be	
identified	 for	short	 and	medium	 cycle	 lengths	
of	three	 to	six	years	 and	may	 be	regarded	 as	
a	core	element 	of	the	correlation 	of	these	
types 	of	loans 	to	economic 	developments.	
For	the	economic	 upturn	 which	 began	 in	the	
second 	quarter 	of	2009, 	however, 	the	case	
for	loans 	for	house 	purchase 	leading 	GDP	is	
not	nearly 	as	open-and-shut. 	Although 	the	
growth 	of	loans 	for	house 	purchase 	already	
halted	 its	slide	 in	the	first	quarter	 of	2008,	 it	
tended	 to	move	 sideways	 until	 the	third	 quar-
ter	of	2009, 	only	beginning 	to	show 	a	per-
ceptible	 upward	 trend	 from	 the	fourth	 quar-
ter	of	2009	 onwards.	 One	 reason	 for	the	rel-
atively 	late	recovery 	of	loans 	for	house 	pur-
chase	 could	 be	that	 potential	 borrowers	 and	
lenders 	only	gradually 	revised 	upwards 	their	assessment 	of	the	outlook 	for	economic 	ac-
tivity	 and	thus	 their	 income	 outlook.10
One	reason 	why	consumer 	loans 	and	loans	
for	house 	purchase 	led	the	business 	cycle	
over	the	1981 	to	2011 	period 	could 	be	that	
banks,	 in	uncertain	 economic	 conditions,	 are	
more 	likely 	to	lend	to	households, 	since	
households 	may	be	able	to	offer 	better-
quality 	collateral 	–	real	estate 	–	than 	enter -
prises. 	Household 	demand 	for	consumer

ever,	 is	probably	 highly	 dependent	 on	expec -Loans for

in	the	fourth 	quarter 	of	2009, 	exactly 	three	
quarters 	after 	GDP	growth 	bottomed 	out.	
The	belated	 recovery	 of	loans	 to	non-financial	
corporations 	in	the	current 	upswing 	is	thus	
by	no	means 	an	aberration 	but	is	instead	
consistent	 with	 historical	 patterns.	 In	all	pre-
vious 	business 	cycles 	since 	the	1970s, 	loans	
to	non-financial 	corporations 	lagged 	GDP	
growth,	 but	mostly	 only	 by	one	 quarter.	 The	
reason	 for	the	longer	 lag	in	the	current	 cycle,	
however,	 is	more	 likely	 to	rest	in	the	fact	that	
aggregate 	economic 	output 	recovered 	unu-
sually	 quickly	 relative	 to	earlier	 recessions	 and	
less	in	unusual 	behaviour 	on	the	part	of	
loans.
The	observed 	lag	of	loans 	to	enterprises 	be-
hind	the	business 	cycle 	stands 	in	a	certain	
contrast 	to	the	idea	that	enterprises 	need	
loans	 to	finance	 production	 and	 investment,	
and	thus	requires 	explanation. 	One	possible	
reason	 is	purely	 statistical:	 that	 the	data	 used	
here	 on	changes	 in	credit	 volume	 model	 not	
only	 new	 business	 but	rather	 the	net	change	–	in	other 	words, 	the	balance 	of	new	busi-
ness, 	redemptions 	and	write-downs. 	Besides	
a	lagged 	response 	of	new	business, 	another	
reason 	for	the	lag	of	credit 	growth 	could	
therefore 	be	that	redemptions 	and/or 	write-
downs 	are	lagging 	real	economic 	activity. 	In	
addition,	 lending	 is	the	outcome	 of	interplay	
between 	supply 	and	demand; 	weak 	credit	
growth 	can	consequently 	be	the	result 	of	
weak 	credit 	demand 	or	can	also	reflect 	re-
strictions	 in	supply.
Demand	 for	bank	 loans	 is	not	constant	 across	
the	business 	cycle 	but	depends 	not	only	on	
lending	 rates	 but	also	on	the	planned	 volume	
of	production 	and	investment 	and	on	the	
costs 	and	availability 	of	other 	sources 	of	
funding. 	One	reason 	for	credit 	demand 	lag-
ging	 GDP	 growth	 is	that	 non-financial	 corpo -
rations	 tend	 to	be	reluctant	 to	engage	 in	new	
fixed	 asset	 formation	 during	 the	first	stage	 of	
an	upswing 	so	as	to	increasingly 	use	their	
available 	capacity 	at	the	outset. 	Another 	is	
that,	 owing	 to	improved	 earnings,	 enterprises	
meet	 their	 funding	 needs	 during	 an	upswing	
increasingly 	from 	their 	own	financial 	re-
sources,	 ie	their	 “earned”	 depreciations	 and

nificance	 of	internal	 financing,	 however,	 it	is

terprises	 initially	 make	 increased	 use	of	other	
forms 	of	external 	financing. 	Alternatives 	to

Deutsche BundesbankUsing spectral analysis to analyse the cyclical relationship between loans to non-financial 
corporations and gross domestic product (GDP) in Germany*
The relationship between two time series is typically 
analysed using correlation coefficients. However, if 
the observed time series move in cycles, this should be 
reflected in the econometric methodology used. Spectral analysis is one option. Not only the cycle length (dura -
tion of one fully completed cycle – similar to a sine wave) and the amplitude of the cycle but also the relationship 
between the cycles of two series can be identified and 
characterised. With regard to the relationship between 
credit growth and GDP growth, the following questions 
can therefore be answered. (1) How strong and how long 
are typical GDP growth and credit growth cycles? (2) How 
strong is the relationship between cycles of the same 
length for credit growth and economic growth? (3) Is 
there a shift between the cycles of both time series? In 
other words, is there a measureable lead or lag?
Spectral analysis measures the variance of time series for 
any given cycle length (or frequency). The longest cycle corresponds to the number of observations (T), and the shortest cycle covers two observations; the maximum number of cycles is T/2. The cycle unit depends on the frequency of the data used (monthly, quarterly or annual observations). This means that spectral analysis enables the identification and measurement of cycles without an 
exogenously given cycle length.
1 Further analysis hinges 
on the estimation  of the spectrum, which indicates the 
distribution of the variance of the time series across the frequencies, therefore representing a smoothed variant 
of the variance estimate.
2
If what one is looking for is the relationship between two 
time series, the cross-spectrum (the product of the spec -
tra of both time series) is also estimated. From this, the 
strength of the relationship (coherence) and the time shift 
between two cycles (phase) can be determined. Coher -
ence indicates how close the relationship is between two time series for a particular frequency. It can therefore be 
understood as a type of correlation coefficient for a given frequency and is similarly defined as the ratio (which can range between 0 and 1) of covariance to the product of 
the individual variances for each frequency. To make a 
statement about the relationship between the two time series that makes economic sense, it is therefore impor -
tant to only interpret the coherence for frequencies in which the time series exhibits strong cycles.
Phase indicates the relative shift of the cycles of both 
time series and can be understood as the cycles’ lead or lag. As the sign is not definite, however, it is advisable to 
first check the direction of the time shift using dynamic 
correlations.
The figure below shows the spectrum of the annual 
growth rate of real loans to non-financial corporations 
and real GDP for the 1981 to 2011 data set. Both spectra

in popular software. — 2 The estimation results do, in fact, depend

demonstrate the largest amplitude at low frequencies 
(0.02 to 0.1), which corresponds to a cycle length of two to ten years. Credit growth is significantly more cyclical than economic growth, however. Longer credit cycles 
(eight to ten years), in particular, are about five times as 
strong as the respective business cycles.
The spectra of the two series form the basis for estimat -
ing the cross spectrum. The resulting coherence between 
credit growth and GDP growth is indicated in the adjacent 
figure together with the 95% confidence interval for all 
frequencies. The frequency range to be interpreted is, as before, between 0.02 to 0.1. For medium to longer-term cycles (five to eight years) there is a very close relationship 
between the growth of real GDP and the growth of real 
loans to non-financial corporations, expressed in high 
levels of coherence (0.67). If the data set is expanded to include the 1970s, the coherence increases even to values 
of up to 0.9. This could be an indication that the correla -
tion between GDP growth and the growth of loans to 
non-financial corporations has loosened over time. The 
main GDP components (private sector investment and pri -
vate consumption expenditure) also turn out to be more 
loosely related to lending to non-financial corporations if the 1970s are omitted than if this decade is included.
The phase provides information about whether the 
cycles co-move (in the same phase) or shift relative to one another (lead/lag). When estimating the phase, however, 
the sequence of the time series determines their signs, 
which means an assessment cannot be readily made about which series leads and which series lags. Because 
of this lack of clarity, a previous correlation analysis can 
help classify the result. The phase is represented in 95% 
confidence intervals in the adjacent chart for all frequen -
cies. As it is measured in radians, it must first be converted 
into quarters in order to be interpreted as a time shift.
3The chart shows a significant phase shift of three quarters 
for medium-length cycles (four to five years). The correla -
tion analysis shows that loans to non-financial corpora -
tions lag GDP growth by an average of three quarters. 
Consequently, assuming that loans to non-financial 
corporations lag GDP growth, the observed phase shift can be interpreted as the medium credit cycles lagging 
GDP growth cycles. This lag is reduced by one quarter if 
the expanded data set (1971 to 2011) is used.

for all available windows, the more frequencies that are involved, the smoother the spectrum and therefore the more difficult it is to identify individual cycles. Here the modified Daniell window with three com-
ponents is applied. — 3 Dividing the phase by 2 π yields the phase shift

There	 are	currently	 no	sound	 empirical	 stud-
ies	for	Germany	 on	the	relative	 importance	 of	
the	various	 forms	 of	corporate	 financing	 and	
its	behaviour 	over	the	business 	cycle. 	How -
ever, 	an	initial 	analysis 	of	the	available 	data	
indicates 	an	increase 	in	the	relative 	signifi -
cance	 of	internal	 finance,	 ie	that	 its	share	 in	
overall	 corporate	 financing	 increases	 in	cycli-
cal	upswings.11	Conversely, 	the	share 	of	ex-
ternal	 financing	 significantly	 lags	the	business	
cycle. 	Of	the	sources 	of	external 	finance,	
since 	spring 	2009 	it	has	been, 	in	particular,	
intra-group	 loans	 and	trade	 credit	 which	 have	
gained	 hugely	 in	significance;	 they	 now	 rep-
resent	 the	most	 important	 sources	 of	external	
finance.	 Their	 rise	has	mirrored	 the	decline	 in	
bank	 lending.12	Capital	 market-based	 financ -
ing	has	played,	 if	at	all,	a	minor	 role.
The importance of bank-related factors
The	initially 	weak 	credit 	growth 	during 	the	
upswing 	could 	be	due	not	only	to	the	de-
mand 	for	credit 	lagging 	the	business 	cycle,	
but	also, 	in	principle, 	to	supply-side 	con-
straints. 	This	could 	be	signified 	by	the	fact	
that	 the	overall	 velocity	 of	credit	 growth	 has	
seen 	a	sharp 	decline 	precisely 	among 	those	
categories 	of	institutions 	whose 	funding	
sources	 and	capital	 base	 were	 hit	particularly	
hard	by	the	financial 	crisis 	and	which 	there -
fore	felt	compelled 	to	deleverage 	by	shrink -
ing	their 	balance 	sheets 	and/or 	shifting 	to	
less	risky	 assets.	 In	Germany,	 such	 deleverag -
ing	has	been 	particularly 	noticeable 	among	
Landesbanken.13	The	efforts 	of	this	category	
of	banks 	to	shrink 	their 	balance 	sheets 	also	
has	to	be	seen	 against	 the	background	 of	the	restructuring 	conditions 	imposed 	by	the	Eu-
ropean	 Union	 in	return	 for	government	 guar-
antees	 or	capital	 injections.
However, 	too	much 	stock 	should 	not	be	
placed 	in	the	observation 	that	weak 	credit	
growth 	was	focused 	primarily 	on	hard-hit	
categories	 of	banks	 –	the	demand	 for	credit	
could	 have	 shifted	 to	banks	 which	 were	 less	
affected.

Survey 	data	can	provide 	information 	on	dif-
ferentiation 	between 	bank-related 	and	de-
mand-related	 factors.	 The	Eurosystem’s	 Bank	
Lending	 Survey	 (BLS),	 which	 explicitly	 solicits	
information	 on	banks’	 lending	 behaviour,	 is	a	
particularly 	good 	instrument 	for	distinguish -
ing	whether 	the	absence 	of	major 	credit	
growth	 during	 the	current	 upswing	 was	 due	
to	supply-side	 constraints	 or	other	 factors.Cyclical trend

German 	banks’ 	credit 	standards 	for	loans 	to	
non-financial 	corporations, 	which 	according	
to	the	BLS	had	initially 	been 	tightened 	con-
siderably 	on	the	heels 	of	the	financial 	crisis,	
were	 not	tightened	 any	further	 as	the	econ -
omy	recovered 	from 	the	fourth 	quarter 	of	
2009	 onwards.	 However,	 it	was	 not	until	 the	
second 	half	of	2010 	that	the	participating	
German 	banks 	began 	to	report 	a	slight 	eas-
ing	of	their	 credit	 standards.	 It	therefore	 can-
not	be	ruled	 out	altogether	 that	 the	tighten -
ing	during 	the	financial 	crisis, 	which 	did	not	
begin	 its	partial	 reversal	 until	 2010,	 may	 have	
curbed	 credit	 growth	 during	 the	upswing.
Key	information 	is	provided 	not	only	by	the	
credit	 standards	 themselves	 but	also	 the	fac-
tors	which 	banks 	stated 	as	having 	led	them	
to	adjust	 their	 lending	 policies.	 The	banks’	 re-
sponses 	to	the	BLS	indicate 	that	since 	the	
third	 quarter	 of	2008	 it	was	increasingly	 insti-
tutions’	 risk	assessment,	 particularly	 the	“ex-
pectations	 regarding	 general	 economic	 activ-
ity”,	 along	 with	 the	“industry	 or	firm-specific	
outlook”, 	which 	were 	responsible 	for	the	
tightening 	of	standards 	in	lending 	to	non-
financial 	corporations. 	Up	until 	mid-2010,	
participating 	German 	banks 	were 	still	citing	
expectations	 regarding	 general	 economic	 ac-
tivity	 as	the	main	 reason	 for	tightening	 their	
credit	 standards.	 Since	 the	second	 quarter	 of	
2010, 	the	economic 	outlook 	has	tended 	to	
encourage	 an	easing	 of	credit	 standards.
Nonetheless,	 the	impact	 of	bank-related	 fac-
tors,	 ie	banks’	 cost	 of	capital,	 ability	 to	access	
market	 financing	 and	liquidity	 position,	 which	
had	 played	 a	major	 role	 in	the	tightening	 of	
standards 	in	the	first	stage 	of	the	financial	crisis, 	remained 	well	behind 	that	of	cyclical	
factors 	from 	the	end	of	2008 	on.	German	
banks’ 	ample 	liquidity, 	leaving 	all	other 	fac-
tors	aside,	 led	institutions	 to	ease	 their	 credit	
standards	 from	 as	early	 as	the	second	 quarter	
of	2009.	 This	 is	likely	 to	be	due	 not	least	 to	
the	Eurosystem’s	 non-standard	 monetary	 pol-
icy	measures.	 Unlike	 in	other	 euro-area	 coun -
tries, 	in	Germany 	the	sovereign 	debt 	crisis	
has	apparently 	had	no	adverse 	impact 	on	
banks’	 lending	 policy	 to	date.
Credit	 standards	 for	households,	 by	contrast,	
were	 almost	 entirely	 unaffected	 by	the	finan -
cial	crisis. 	Only 	in	late	2008 	and	early 	2009	
were 	they	then 	tightened 	considerably, 	also	
against	 the	background	 of	increasing	 risks	 to	
households’	 income	 situation;	 however,	 these	
tighter 	standards 	were 	gradually 	rolled 	back	
over	 the	course	 of	2011.	 Here,	 too,	 the	eco-
nomic 	outlook 	was	the	main 	driver; 	bank-
related	 factors	 were	 irrelevant.
Since 	late	2009 	and	early 	2010 	(and	thus	
somewhat 	earlier 	than 	the	BLS), 	regular 	sur-
veys	of	non-financial 	corporations 	on	their	
financing	 situation	 (such	 as	the	ifo	credit	 con-
straint	 indicator	 and	the	survey	 conducted	 by	
the	German	 Chamber	 of	Industry	 and	 Com -
merce	 (DIHK))	 have	 been	 indicating	 a	consid -
erable 	easing 	in	access 	to	bank 	loans. 	The	
credit 	constraint 	indicator 	is	currently 	at	his-
toric	lows; 	even 	in	the	upswing 	prior 	to	the

to	capably	 explain	 the	interest	 rates	 on	loans	
to	non-financial 	corporations.14	Whereas 	in-
terest 	rates 	on	corporate 	loans 	were 	even	
temporarily 	significantly 	lower 	than 	could	
have 	been 	expected 	owing 	to	wholesale	
funding 	costs, 	they	are	currently 	once 	again	
very	consistent 	with	the	scope 	predicted 	by	
the	models.	 This	means	 that	 interest	 rates	 are	
unlikely 	to	have 	curbed 	lending 	growth 	dur-
ing	the	recent	 upswing.
All	in	all,	these 	indicators 	point 	to	demand-
side	 factors	 as	the	main	 reason	 for	the	slug-
gish	lending 	growth 	during 	the	cyclical 	up-
swing. 	This	picture 	is	confirmed 	by	econo -
metric 	analyses. 	Although 	panel 	estimates	
based 	on	BLS	data	find	that	negative 	bank-
related	 factors	 did	make	 a	significant	 contri -
bution 	to	weaker 	growth 	of	loans 	to	non-
financial	 corporations	 during	 the	crisis,15	this	
negative 	supply-side 	impact, 	according 	to	
these 	estimates, 	was	confined 	largely	
to	2009.	 No	dampening	 of	credit	 growth	 by	
bank-related 	factors 	can	be	observed 	past	
the	first	quarter 	of	2010 	even 	if	the	estima -
tion	 horizon	 is	extended	 to	the	present.
Econometric analysis
A	more	 comprehensive	 analysis	 of	the	deter -
minants	 of	credit	 growth	 which	 at	the	same	
time	 takes	 account	 of	several	 factors	 of	influ-
ence 	and	all	conceivable 	interrelations 	be-
tween	 them	 can	be	performed	 using	 a	vector	
autoregressive 	(VAR) 	model. 	The	VAR	ap-
proach 	used 	here	covers 	the	growth 	rate	of	
real	loans	 to	non-financial	 corporations,16	the	
growth	 rate	 of	real	GDP ,	 export	 expectations	of	manufacturing 	enterprises 	according 	to	
the	ifo	business	 test	(balance	 in	percent),	 the	
EONIA 	as	a	proxy 	monetary 	policy 	variable,	
and	an	indicator 	of	financial 	market 	tension	
based	 on	responses	 provided	 by	German	 BLS	
banks 	on	the	bank-related 	determinants 	of	
credit	 standards.
This	model 	was	used 	to	simulate 	the	re-
sponses 	of	all	model 	variables 	to	a	negative	
financial	 market	 shock	 (see	chart	 on	page 75).	
The	results	 indicate	 that	 credit	 growth	 initially	
rises	in	response 	to	this	shock 	before 	then	
showing	 the	expected	 negative	 response	 be-
ginning	 in	the	second	 quarter,	 which	 initially	
amplifies 	further 	before 	then 	petering 	out.	
The	initial	 positive	 response	 of	credit	 growth	
to	a	negative 	financial 	market 	shock 	can	be	
explained	 by	enterprises’	 increased	 utilisation	
of	previously 	negotiated 	credit 	lines, 	since	
other	 sources	 of	funding,	 such	 as	internal	 fi-
nancing, 	are	affected 	more 	quickly 	and/or	
more	 strongly	 by	the	shock.
One	 interesting	 outcome	 is	that	 loans	 to	non-

the	financial	 markets	 with	 a	lag,	whereas	 the	
negative	 impact	 on	the	real	economy	 occurs

in	the	fact	that	 uncertainty	 about	 the	(global)	
consequences	 of	the	shock	 for	the	real	sector	
directly 	leads 	enterprises 	to	behave 	with	
greater 	caution. 	At	all	events, 	this	finding 	is	
consistent	 with	 the	lag	of	loans	 to	enterprises	
behind 	GDP	already 	established 	by	the	cor-

Specifi  cation of the VAR model
 
The VAR approach used here contains 
fi  ve endogenous variables: the growth rate of real loans to non-fi  nancial corpor-ations (fi  rst difference of the logarithmic values), the growth rate of real GDP, ex-port expectations in the next three months (ifo business survey, manufactur-ing, balance in percent), the overnight rate EONIA as a proxy for the monetary policy variable, and an indicator for fi  -nancial market tensions. This indicator is constructed using data provided by Ger-man banks participating in the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) on bank-related de-terminants of credit standards (cost of capital, fi  nancing conditions and liquidity situation) with the help of econometric factor extraction techniques. The BLS variables on which the factor extraction is based suggest that the estimated fac-tor represents a good indicator of fi  nan-cial market tensions.
The VAR model estimations are based on 
quarterly data and are performed for the period from the fourth quarter of 2002 to the second quarter of 2011. The rela-tively short estimation period is due to the availability of BLS data; the survey was not introduced until the end of 2002. All model variables are included in the model with two lags; the lag structure is based on the standard information cri-teria. The explanatory content of the in-dividual estimation equations is good despite the relatively short estimation period.
The shocks are identifi  ed using a Cholesky 
decomposition by assuming that the fi  nan-cial market shocks will impact on the growth rate of real loans as well as EONIA in the same quarter, whereas the effects on real GDP growth and export expect-ations will not be felt until the next quar-ter. The resulting impulse response func-tions are robust to alternative recursive structures of economic shocks.
In order to estimate the impulse response 
functions, we simulate an unexpected in-crease of one standard deviation in the indicator for fi  nancial market tensions (negative fi  nancial market shock). The 78% confi  dence intervals for the impulse response functions are calculated using a standard bootstrap procedure with 1,000 replications.
The historical decomposition looks at the 
contributions made by the shocks in the individual model variables to the growth rate of real loans over time. In concrete terms, the deviations of real loan growth from its determinist component or, to be more precise, from its long-run aver-age at each point in time are broken down into the contributions made by the  individual VAR model variables’ cu-mulated shocks, ie shocks from the quar-ter under review as well as the lagged effects of shocks from previous quarters. Formally, the historic decomposition rep-resents a function of previously simulated impulse response functions and struc-tural shocks.
To test for robustness, further estima-
tions were carried out with alternative 
specifi  cations (for instance, the ifo export 
expectations were replaced by an alter-native indicator of external demand for German goods); this did not alter the main results.

real	loans 	in	itself. 	In	subsequent 	quarters,	
the	influence 	of	financial 	market 	shocks 	on	
credit 	growth, 	according 	to	this	estimate,	
was	actually	 increasingly	 positive.	 The	growth	
of	loans 	to	enterprises 	in	2010 	also	already	
corresponded	 largely	 to	the	longer-run	 trend,	
which 	means 	that	it	is	not	possible 	to	diag-
nose	 any	exceptionally	 weak	 credit	 growth.17
Conclusions
The	study	 results	 presented	 in	this	article	 pro-
vide	 no	indication	 that	 the	sluggish	 and	 ten-
tative	 recovery	 of	loans	 during	 the	economic	
upswing 	may	be	described 	as	unusual 	or	
even	 worrisome.	 One	 reason	 is	that,	 since	 the	
beginning	 of	this	year,	 the	annual	 growth	 of	
loans 	to	the	domestic 	private 	sector 	has	re-turned	 to	a	level	 corresponding	 to	that	 of	av-
erage 	growth 	since 	2002, 	which 	–	by	Ger-
man	 standards	 –	cannot	 be	described	 as	unu-
sually 	low.	This	is	particularly 	true	of	the	
growth 	rates 	for	loans 	to	non-financial 	cor-
porations, 	which 	were 	the	main 	reason 	for	
the	decline	 in	credit	 growth	 which	 lasted	 up	
until	 March	 2010	 and	for	the	sluggish	 pace	 of	
the	subsequent	 recovery.	 Another	 is	that	 the	
lag	in	the	growth	 of	loans	 to	enterprises	 be-
hind	GDP	growth 	observed 	during 	the	cur-
rent	 upswing	 is	consistent	 with	 historical	 pat-
terns 	established 	for	the	1981 	to	2011 	hori-
zon	using	 correlation	 and	spectral	 analyses.Historical decomposition of the growth of real loans to non-financial

The	results	 of	the	BLS	for	Germany,	 as	well	 as	
those 	of	other 	surveys, 	indicate 	that	muted	
lending 	growth 	during 	the	economic 	up-
swing	 is	due	 largely	 to	demand-side	 and	 cy-
clical 	factors. 	Although 	econometric 	studies	
based 	on	BLS	data	show 	that	the	tension	
which 	first	struck 	the	financial 	markets 	in	
summer	 2007	 and	banks’	 subsequent	 financ -
ing	and	liquidity	 problems	 made	 a	significant	
contribution 	to	decelerating 	the	growth 	of	
loans	 to	non-financial	 corporations,	 the	neg-ative	 impact	 of	these	 factors	 was	 largely	 con-
fined	 to	2009.	 It	was	 not	possible	 to	identify	
a	dampening	 of	credit	 growth	 by	the	effects	
of	the	financial 	crisis 	on	German 	banks 	past	
the	first	quarter	 of	2010.	 This	 state	 of	affairs	
has	continued 	to	the	present: 	according 	to	
the	BLS,	 the	latest	 results	 of	which	 are	avail-
able	 up	to	and	 including	 the	second	 quarter	
of	2011,	 the	sovereign	 debt	 crisis	 has	likewise	
failed 	to	leave 	any	noticeable 	mark 	on	Ger-
man	 banks’	 lending	 behaviour.

International cooperation in banking 
 regulation: past and present
International 	and	European 	cooperation 	in	banking 	regulation 	goes 	back 	almost 	forty 	years.	
When 	institutional 	cooperation 	first	started, 	the	main 	idea	was	for	banking 	supervisors 	to	ex-
change	 views	 and	 findings.	 Since	 then,	 cooperation	 has	become	 considerably	 more	 extensive.	
As	financial	 institutions	 stepped	 up	their	 global	 activities,	 the	need	 for	more	 intensive	 and	com-
prehensive	 worldwide	 cooperation	 between	 supervisory	 authorities	 when	 developing	 and	coord -
inating	 minimum	 supervisory	 standards	 likewise	 grew.	 This	 greater	 cooperation	 is	also	 required	
to	ensure 	a	level	playing 	field	and	to	combat 	regulatory 	arbitrage. 	The	logical 	response 	to	in-
creasingly	 internationally	 interconnected	 financial	 players	 was	 a	more	 globally	 oriented	 debate	
and	coordination	 of	measures	 to	ensure	 financial	 stability,	 and	to	prevent	 and	manage	 crises.
This	 process	 of	intensifying	 and	harmonising	 banking	 regulation	 is	closely	 mirrored	 at	the	Euro-
pean	 level,	 where	 it	is	actually	 even	 more	 visible	 as	a	result	 of	the	committees	 which	 were	 cre-
ated	 mainly	 on	a	legal	 basis.	 In	terms	 of	banking	 regulation,	 it	reached	 its	(preliminary)	 peak	 with	
the	establishment	 of	the	European	 Banking	 Authority	 (EBA).
The	following	 article	 aims	 to	provide	 an	overview	 of	international	 and	European	 cooperation	 in	
the	key	committees	 and	authorities	 dealing	 with	 banking	 regulation.DEUTSCHE

International cooperation in banking 
regulation: the Basel Committee  
on Banking Supervision
The	Basel	 Committee	 on	Banking	 Supervision	
was	established 	at	the	end	of	1974 	as	the	
	Basel 	Committee 	on	Banking 	Regulations	
and	Supervisory 	Practices, 	a	permanent 	sub-
committee,	 by	the	central	 bank	 governors	 of	
the	Group	 of	Ten	(G10)	 countries.1	Its	perman-
ent	secretariat	 is	still	located	 at	the	Bank	 for	
International 	Settlements 	(BIS)	in	Basel. 	The	
Committee’s	 founding	 members	 were	 senior	
staff	from 	the	central 	banks 	and	supervisory	
authorities	 of	the	G10	 countries	 and	 Luxem -
bourg.	 Germany	 is	represented	 by	the	Deut -
sche	Bundesbank 	and	the	Federal 	Financial	
Supervisory 	Authority 	(Bundesanstalt für 
Finanz  dienstleistungsaufsicht ,	or	BaFin). 	The	
Committee	 was	specifically	 set	up	in	response	
to	banking 	problems 	with	an	international	
impact, 	in	particular 	the	collapse 	of	the	US	
Franklin 	National 	Bank 	and	the	Cologne-
based	 Bankhaus	 Herstatt.
From 	the	outset, 	the	Basel 	Committee 	was	
intended 	to	strengthen 	the	stability 	of	the	
international 	banking 	system 	by	enabling	
committee 	members 	to	exchange 	ideas 	and	
information 	with	a	view 	to	improving 	their	
respective 	supervisory 	systems. 	In	addition,	
the	Committee 	was	to	be	a	platform 	allow -
ing	banking	 problems	 with	 international	 con-
sequences	 to	be	recognised	 early	 and	 ensur -
ing	that	 no	foreign	 bank	 was	 able	 to	escape	
supervision. 	These 	objectives 	have 	lost	none	
of	their	 relevance	 in	today’s	 world.The	“Concordat” 	can	be	described 	as	the	
first	milestone	 in	the	Basel	 Committee’s	 work.	
This	 paper,	 which	 was	 originally	 published	 in	
1975 	and	revised 	in	1983, 	contains 	recom -
mendations 	on	the	cooperation 	between	
home	 and	host	 authorities	 in	supervising	 the	
cross-border 	activities 	of	banks. 	It	forms 	the	
basis 	for	the	many 	memoranda 	of	under -
standing 	that	international 	supervisory 	bod-
ies	usually	 conclude	 bilaterally.	 These	 memo -
randa 	of	understanding 	and	the	regular 	ex-
change 	of	information 	that	they	entail 	have	
developed 	into	key	components 	of	the	con-
solidated	 supervision	 of	cross-border	 banking	
groups	 in	Europe.
In	1988, 	the	Basel 	Committee 	published 	a	
document 	entitled 	“International 	Conver -
gence 	of	Capital 	Measurement 	and	Capital	
Standards.” 	This	framework, 	nowadays 	also	
known	 as	the	Basel	 Capital	 Accord	 or	Basel	 I,	
contained 	the	first	internationally 	harmon -
ised	 rules	 on	determining	 a	comparable	 cap-
ital	ratio	 for	large	 internationally	 active	 banks.	
Key	elements	 were	 the	division	 of	regulatory	
capital 	into	tier	1	capital 	and	tier	2	capital,	
and	the	assignment 	of	borrowers 	to	one	of	
three 	classes: 	public-sector 	entities, 	banks	
and	other 	borrowers. 	As	a	capital 	standard,	
the	minimum	 ratio	 of	capital	 to	risk-weighted	
assets	 was	 set	at	8%.	 In	publishing	 the	Basel	
Capital 	Accord, 	the	Basel 	Committee 	issued	
the	first	regulatory 	recommendations 	to	its	
member 	states. 	Besides 	the	G10	countries,

or	regulations	 in	a	binding	 manner.
In	1996, 	the	Basel 	Committee 	amended 	the	
Basel 	Capital 	Accord 	to	include 	market 	risk.	
That	meant 	that	price 	risks	associated 	with	
debt	 securities,	 equity	 instruments	 and	 com-
modities 	now	had,	like	credit 	risk,	to	be	
backed	 with	 capital.
In	order 	to	align 	the	capital 	rules 	for	credit	
institutions	 more	 closely	 to	actual	 risk	and	to	
take	account 	of	the	most 	recent 	develop -
ments	 in	the	financial	 markets	 and	 in	banks’	
risk	management, 	the	Basel 	I	standard 	was	
subjected 	to	a	fundamental 	overhaul 	at	the	
end	of	the	1990s. 	In	mid-2004, 	the	revised	
framework 	“International 	Convergence 	of	
Capital 	Measurement 	and	Capital 	Stand -ards”, 	Basel 	II	for	short, 	was	endorsed. 	Con-
ceptually, 	the	new	framework 	comprises	
three 	pillars: 	minimum 	capital 	requirements	
(Pillar 	1),	the	supervisory 	review 	process 	(Pil-
lar 2) 	and	greater 	market 	discipline 	through	
extended 	disclosure 	requirements 	for	banks	
(Pillar 	3).	Basel 	II	was	transposed 	into	Euro -
pean	 and	German	 law	according	 to	an	inter-
nationally 	agreed 	schedule 	and,	in	the	EU,	
entered	 into	force	 in	2007	 for	banks	 applying	
simpler 	approaches 	to	determining 	compli -
ance 	with	the	minimum 	regulatory 	require -
ments	 and	in	2008	 for	those	 using	 advanced	
risk	measurement	 approaches.
Building	 on	the	harmonised	 capital	 adequacy	
rules	 set	out	in	the	Basel	 Capital	 Accord,	 the	
“Core	 Principles	 for	Effective	 Banking	 Super -
vision” 	were 	published 	in	1997. 	The	Core	Market risk

Principles	 contain	 provisions	 on	the	organisa -
tion	 of	banking	 supervision,	 cooperation	 be-
tween 	supervisory 	authorities, 	requirements	
in	banking 	business 	and	the	entire 	supervis -
ory	process	 from	 licensing	 to	resolution.	 They	
were	 first	 revised	 in	2006	 –	after	 Basel	 II	was	
endorsed. 	The	implementation 	and	obser -
vance	 of	the	Core	 Principles	 serves	 as	an	indi-
cator,	 for	instance,	 for	the	International	 Mon -
etary	 Fund	 (IMF)	 and	 other	 supranational	 or-
ganisations, 	in	assessing 	the	stability 	of	na-
tional	 financial	 markets.
Nowadays,	 most	 of	the	Basel	 Committee’s	 in-
dividual 	projects 	and	decisions 	are	prepared	
and	pressed 	ahead 	with	by	four	working	
groups.	 The	Policy	 Development	 Group	 iden-
tifies	 and	reviews	 current	 developments	 and,	
where 	appropriate, 	puts	forward 	regulatory	
proposals	 that	 promote	 a	stable	 banking	 sys-
tem. 	The	Standards 	Implementation 	Group	
examines 	inter alia 	whether 	and	how	the	
member 	states 	implement 	the	Committee’s	
guidance 	and	standards, 	and	monitors 	co-
operation 	between 	the	national 	supervisory	
authorities.	 This	 is	intended	 to	achieve	 global	
consistency 	in	the	application 	of	the	recom -
mendations 	and	a	comparable 	supervisory	
standard. 	As	many 	prudential 	supervisory	
standards 	are	based 	on	accounting 	regula -
tions,	 the	Accounting	 Task	 Force	 helps	 to	de-
velop 	international 	accounting 	and	auditing	
standards 	and	practices, 	not	least 	with	the	
aim	of	promoting	 sound	 risk	management	 at	
banks.	 In	addition,	 it	supports	 market	 discip -
line	by	drawing 	up	transparency 	require -
ments. 	Finally, 	in	order 	to	involve 	non-
member	 states	 in	its	deliberations	 at	an	early	
stage	 in	the	process,	 the	Committee	 has	set	up	the	Basel	 Consultative	 Group,	 which	 pro-
vides 	a	forum 	for	exchanging 	information	
and	facilitates 	dialogue 	with	supervisory 	au-
thorities 	that	are	not	members 	of	the	Com -
mittee.
Each 	of	these 	four	groups 	has	a	number 	of	
subgroups	 or	task	 forces	 to	work	 on	the	de-
tails	of	the	individual	 issues,	 discussing	 in	par-
ticular 	the	technical 	aspects 	of	the	subjects	
allocated 	to	them. 	For	instance, 	the	Policy	
Development 	Group 	has	established 	special	
working 	groups 	to	look	at	issues 	relating 	to	
prudential	 liquidity	 requirements,	 the	regula -
tory	definition 	of	capital 	and	trading 	book	
risk.2
As	in	the	Basel	 Committee,	 Bundesbank	 and	
BaFin 	staff	usually 	jointly 	represent 	German	
banking 	supervisors 	in	the	subordinated	
working	 groups.
The	number 	of	countries 	involved 	in	the	
Committee’s	 work	 has	increased	 significantly	
over	its	almost 	40-year 	history. 	Important	
milestones 	in	international 	banking 	regula -

of	Twenty	 (G20)3	has	assumed	 a	leading	 role	
and	taken	 charge	 of	setting	 objectives	 for	de-
veloping	 financial	 market	 regulation,	 which	 is	
also	 reflected	 in	the	composition	 of	the	rele-
vant	 specialist	 prudential	 supervisory	 commit -
tees. 	Since 	2009, 	the	Basel 	Committee 	has	
representatives 	from 	44	central 	banks 	and	
the	supervisory 	authorities 	of	27	member	
states.4	Moreover, 	the	IMF,	the	European	
Central 	Bank 	(ECB), 	the	European 	Commis -
sion, 	the	EBA	and	the	BIS-hosted 	Financial	
Stability 	Institute 	take	part	in	Committee	
meetings	 as	observers.
The	management	 and	reporting	 structures	 of	
the	international	 banking	 regulatory	 commit -
tees	 have	 also	 changed	 over	 the	years.	 While	
the	relevant 	committees 	were 	being 	estab -
lished,	 reports	 and	 recommendations	 for	ac-
tion	were	 addressed	 primarily	 to	central	 bank	
governors.	 Later,	 they	 were	 addressed	 to	cen-
tral	bank	 governors	 and	heads	 of	supervision.
The	recent 	financial 	crisis 	marked 	another	
watershed	 event.	 The	Basel	 Committee	 now	
reports	 the	results	 of	its	work	 not	only	 to	its	
members’	 central	 bank	 governors	 and	 heads	
of	supervision,	 but	also	 to	the	G20	 heads	 of	
state	 or	government.	 This	 reporting	 line	goes	
via	the	Financial 	Stability 	Board 	(FSB), 	which	
coordinates	 all	aspects	 of	and	measures	 relat-
ing	to	international 	financial 	market 	regula -
tion.
The	FSB	was	established 	at	a	G20	summit	
meeting 	in	2009 	as	the	successor 	to	the	Fi-
nancial 	Stability 	Forum5	with	an	extended	
group 	of	members 	and	a	broadened 	man-
date.	 With	 a	view	 to	promoting	 financial	 sta-bility,	 its	mandate	 prescribes	 as	its	main	 tasks	
the	assessment 	of	the	stability 	of	the	global	
financial 	system 	to	identify 	potential 	vulner -
abilities	 and	the	promotion	 of	the	implemen -
tation 	of	regulatory 	and	supervisory 	meas -
ures.	 It	therefore	 ensures	 that	 the	G20	 reso-
lutions	 on	financial	 stability	 measures	 are	im-
plemented 	consistently, 	and	advises 	and	
liaises	 with	 regulatory	 standard	 setting	 bodies	
(eg	the	Basel	 Committee).
The	inclusion	 of	the	Basel	 proposals	 for	regu-
lation	 in	the	G20	 action	 plans	 and	the	(subse -
quent)	 explicit	 approval	 of	the	committee	 re-
sults	as	well	as	the	G20	leaders’ 	voluntary	
commitment 	to	consistently 	implement 	the	
Basel	 Committee’s	 resolutions	 help	 to	ensure	
timely 	and	parallel 	implementation 	world -
wide. 	This	is	imperative 	in	order, 	first, 	to	
strengthen	 the	resilience	 of	banks	 and	there -
fore	reduce 	the	likelihood 	and	gravity 	of	fu-
ture	 financial	 crises	 and,	 second, 	to	create	 a	
level	 playing	 field	 for	all	banks.	 Even	 though	
the	resolutions 	and/or 	recommendations 	of	
the	Basel	 Committee	 are	not	legally	 binding,	
they	 are	recognised	 internationally	 and	often	
form 	the	basis 	for	supervisory 	practices 	in

ommendations 	–	in	particular 	for	the	group	
of	countries 	directly 	involved 	in	negoti -
ations – 	is	therefore 	evidence, 	not	least, 	of	
the	Committee’s	 excellent	 reputation	 and	 its	
status 	as	an	international 	standard 	setter 	in	
banking	 regulation.
The Basel Committee’s responses  
to the financial crisis6
More 	recently, 	the	Basel 	Committee’s 	work	
has	been	 dominated,	 in	particular,	 by	the	fi-
nancial	 crisis.	 At	the	request	 of	the	G20,	 the	
Basel 	Committee 	has	taken 	the	action 	be-
lieved	 to	be	necessary	 as	a	result	 of	the	crisis.	
In	the	autumn	 of	2008,	 for	instance,	 it	pub-
lished 	revised 	recommendations 	on	liquidity	
risk	management. 	At	the	same 	time, 	the	
Committee 	developed 	a	first	package 	of	
measures	 increasing	 the	capital	 requirements	
for	securitisation	 transactions	 and	market	 risk	
in	the	Basel 	II	framework, 	formulating 	more	
clearly	 the	requirements	 for	banks’	 risk	man-
agement 	and	enhancing 	disclosure 	require -
ments. 	This	Basel 	II	enhancement 	package,	
also	referred 	to	as	Basel 	II.5,	was	finalised 	in	
mid-2009;	 it	is	scheduled	 to	come	 into	 force	
at	the	end	of	2011.
In	a	second 	step, 	in	December 	2010, 	the	
	Basel 	Committee 	decided 	on	further 	meas -
ures	 to	enhance	 the	resilience	 of	the	banking	
system. 	The	document 	entitled 	“Basel 	III:	A	
global 	regulatory 	framework 	for	more 	resil-
ient	banks	 and	banking	 systems”	 comprises	 a	
series 	of	new	prudential 	regulatory 	stand -
ards. 	The	Basel 	II	rules 	have 	been 	supple -
mented	 and,	 in	part,	 further	 developed.	 Spe-cifically,	 Basel	 III	places	 a	focus	 on	the	follow -
ing	key	points:	 strengthening	 the	quality	 and	
quantity	 of	the	regulatory	 capital	 framework,	
introducing	 a	global	 liquidity	 standard,	 cover -
ing	further	 risks	 with	 capital,	 deploying	 meas -
ures	 to	reduce	 cyclicality,	 introducing	 a	lever-
age	ratio 	and	providing 	a	basic 	concept 	for	
regulating	 systemically	 important	 banks.7	The	
rules 	are	to	come 	into	force 	from 	2013 	on-
wards,	 with	 appropriate	 transitional	 arrange -
ments 	planned 	in	order 	to	prevent 	negative	
consequences	 for	the	real	economy.
Banking regulatory legislation  
in the European Union
The	Basel 	requirements 	are	a	major 	compo -
nent	 of	the	regulatory	 harmonisation	 process	
within	 the	European	 Union.	 Through	 its	role	
as	an	observer 	in	the	Basel 	Committee, 	the	
European 	Commission 	helps 	to	develop 	the	
Basel	 standards	 from	 scratch	 so	as	to	achieve	
close 	interlinkages 	at	the	international 	and	
European	 level.	 In	addition,	 it	is	a	member	 of	
the	FSB.	This	guarantees 	that	the	European	
legislative	 process	 is	able	 to	proceed	 in	paral -
lel	with	the	development 	and	implementa -
tion	 of	international	 agreements.
For	instance,	 on	20 July	 2011	 –	ie	just	a	few	
months 	after 	the	publication 	of	the	Basel 	III	
rules 	on	16 December 	2010 	–	the	European	
Commission	 presented	 both	 a	proposal	 for	a	Basel II.5

proposal 	for	a	regulation 	on	prudential 	re-

ment	 firms	 (Capital	 Requirements	 Directive	 or	
CRD	IV),	with	which 	the	Basel 	III	rules 	are	to	
be	implemented	 in	the	European	 Union.	 They	
will	replace 	the	existing 	capital 	guidelines 	in	
their 	current 	versions, 	which 	have 	already	
been 	revised 	several 	times,8	as	soon 	as	this	
new	 European	 legal	 framework	 has	been	 ap-
proved 	through 	the	democratic 	process 	of	
the	codecision	 procedure	 pursuant	 to	Article	
294	of	the	Treaty 	on	the	Functioning 	of	the	
European 	Union 	(TFEU)9.	However, 	whereas	
the	Basel	 Committee	 addresses	 mainly	 major	
credit 	institutions, 	the	European 	regulations	
–	in	order 	to	achieve 	a	level	playing 	field	–	
	apply	 to	all	credit	 institutions	 and	investment	
firms	 within	 the	meaning	 of	CRD	 IV.
With 	the	recent 	revision 	of	its	capital 	stand -
ards,	 the	European	 Commission	 is	also	effect -
ing	a	paradigm 	shift	in	the	legislative 	ap-
proach 	applied 	in	European 	banking 	regula -
tion.	 Up	to	now,	 the	key	provisions	 of	Euro-
pean 	banking 	supervision 	law	had	always	
been	 laid	down	 in	directives	 (eg	CRD	 I	to	III).	
Pursuant	 to	Article	 288	third	 subparagraph	 of	
the	TFEU,	 directives	 are	binding	 only	 as	to	the	
result	 to	be	achieved,	 and	member	 states	 are	
free	 in	their	 choice	 of	form	 and	methods	 for	
national 	implementation. 	That 	leaves 	na-
tional	 legislators	 a	certain	 degree	 of	flexibility	
which, 	in	the	currently 	applicable 	capital	
standards,	 is	still	supplemented	 by	numerous	
options	 designed	 to	take	 national	 particulari -
ties	into	 account.In	the	light	 of	the	financial	 crisis,	 a	group	 of	
experts 	chaired 	by	the	former 	IMF	president	
Jacques	 de	Larosière	 concluded	 that	 precisely	
this	flexibility 	and	these 	options 	meant 	that	
the	European 	regulatory 	framework 	lacked	
coherence	 and	a	consistent	 set	of	rules.10	The	
group 	therefore 	recommended 	that	such	
scope 	for	national 	exceptions 	should 	be	
avoided	 going	 forward,	 with	 greater	 focus	 to	
be	laid	on	the	instrument	 of	regulation.11	The	
Economic 	and	Financial 	Affairs 	Council	
(ECOFIN), 	in	its	conclusions 	of	9 June 	2009	
–  which 	were 	confirmed 	by	the	European	
Council 	on	19  June 	2009 	–	agreed 	to	
strengthen	 the	quality	 and	 coherence	 of	na-
tional	 supervision	 and	to	improve	 the	supervi -
sion	of	cross-border 	financial 	groups, 	inter 
alia	through	 a	single	 European	 rulebook	 that	
applies 	to	all	financial 	institutions 	active 	in	
the	single	 market.12
Against 	this	backdrop, 	large 	parts 	of	the	
regulatory	 framework	 are	intended	 to	be	put	
into	place 	through 	a	regulation, 	which 	does	
not	involve 	implementation 	as	it	is	directly	
applicable	 in	all	member	 states	 and	therefore

quidity 	standard, 	a	large 	exposure 	threshold	
and	a	leverage	 ratio)	 as	well	 as	disclosure	 re-
quirements	 will	be	laid	down	 by	means	 of	a	
regulation. 	The	directive, 	by	contrast, 	is	
mainly	 –	as	before	 –	intended	 to	set	out	the	
basic	 principles	 for	conducting	 banking	 busi-
ness	(eg	the	taking-up 	and	pursuit 	of	bank -
ing	business	 or	terms	 for	the	freedom	 of	es-
tablishment	 and	the	freedom	 to	provide	 serv-
ices,	 but	also	principles	 for	better	 supervision,	
uniform	 sanctions,	 corporate	 governance	 re-
quirements 	and	the	introduction 	of	capital	
buffers).
The	interaction 	between 	the	regulation 	and	
the	directive, 	which 	should 	be	seen 	as	two	
parts	 of	one	and	the	same	 package,	 will,	 it	is	
hoped, 	maximise 	harmonisation 	in	banking	
regulation. 	In	combination 	with	the	powers	
of	the	newly	 established	 EBA,	 this	will	signifi -
cantly 	limit	the	scope 	for	divergent 	imple -
mentation 	and	application 	in	the	member	
states.	 Nonetheless,	 the	particularities	 of	the	
various 	national 	banking 	landscapes 	should	
not	be	allowed	 to	slip	out	of	focus.
Cooperation in European banking 
 regulation: the EBA
The	European 	Council, 	in	its	conclusions 	of	
19 June 	2009, 	confirmed 	the	establishment	
of	the	European	 System	 of	Financial	 Supervi -
sion	(ESFS). 	This	is	a	network 	consisting 	of	
the	national	 supervisory	 authorities	 of	the	27	
EU	member 	states, 	the	three 	new	European	
Supervisory 	Authorities 	(ESAs) 	for	banking,	
securities	 and	 insurance,	 their	 Joint	 Commit -tee	and	the	European 	Systemic 	Risk	Board	
(ESRB).
The	ESFS 	started 	work 	on	1  January 	2011.	
The	EBA	is	responsible 	for	banking 	supervi -
sion.14	Together	 with	 the	national	 supervisory	
authorities	 it	will	help	 to	improve	 the	quality	
and	coherence	 of	banking	 supervision	 in	Eur-
ope,	 strengthen	 the	oversight	 of	cross-border	
groups	 and	introduce	 a	single	 European	 rule-
book	 for	financial	 institutions.
Nonetheless, 	the	competence 	and	responsi -
bility	 for	overseeing	 financial	 institutions	 and	
markets 	in	principle 	remains 	at	the	national	
level.	 The	EBA	 therefore	 has	a	dual	 status:	 on	
the	one	hand,	 it	is	an	EU	agency	 with	 its	own	
legal	 personality;	 on	the	other	 hand,	 it	is	also	
a	members-driven	 organisation	 characterised	
to	no	small 	degree 	by	the	involvement 	of	
banking	 supervisors	 from	 its	27	member	 na-
tions. 	Its	“parallel” 	and	balanced 	focus 	on	
both	 the	European	 and	the	national	 level	 are	
evident	 in	the	recitals	 of	the	EBA	 Regulation.	
They	 require	 that	 the	EBA	 “should	 act	with	 a	
view	 to	improving	 the	functioning	 of	the	in-
ternal 	market, 	in	particular 	by	ensuring 	a	
high,	 effective	 and	consistent	 level	 of	regula -
tion	and	supervision 	taking 	account 	of	the	
varying 	interests 	of	all	Member 	States 	and	
the	different 	nature 	of	financial 	institu -
tions.”15European

The	EBA,	 as	a	legally	 independent	 body	 head -
quartered 	in	London, 	should 	have 	adminis -
trative	 and	 financial	 autonomy.	 It	is	account -
able	to	the	European 	Parliament 	and	the

visors, 	the	Management 	Board, 	a	Chairper -
son,	 the	Executive	 Director	 and	 the	Board	 of	
Appeal.
The	EBA’s 	highest 	decision-making 	body 	is	
the	Board	 of	Supervisors.	 Its	voting	 members	
are	the	heads 	of	the	national 	authorities 	re-
sponsible	 for	supervising	 credit	 institutions	 in	
each	 EU	member	 state.	 In	addition,	 there	 are	
non-voting 	members, 	namely 	one	represen -
tative 	from 	each 	of	the	European 	Commis -
sion, 	the	ECB, 	the	ESRB 	and	the	two	other	
ESAs, 	and	the	Chairperson 	of	the	EBA. 	The	
Board	 of	Supervisors	 may	 decide	 to	admit	 ob-servers	 (as	in	the	case	 of	non-EU	 members	 of	
the	European	 Economic	 Area,	 in	other	 words	
Iceland, 	Liechtenstein 	and	Norway). 	Where

of	the	EBA.	 A	Board	 of	Appeal	 has	been	 set	
up	to	deal	with	appeals 	against 	decisions	
taken	 by	the	EBA.	 This	 is	a	joint	 body	 of	the	
three 	new	ESAs. 	The	six	members 	of	the

their	 decisions	 and	 are	not	bound	 by	any	in-

by	the	Board	 of	Appeal	 may	 be	brought	 be-
fore	the	Court 	of	Justice 	of	the	European	
Union.The	Banking 	Stakeholder 	Group 	is	intended	
to	ensure 	that	the	banking 	industry 	is	in-
volved	 in	the	EBA’s	 ongoing	 work	 at	an	early	
stage 	and	that	its	expertise 	is	exploited. 	The

and	coherent 	application 	of	EU	supervisory	
legislation.
EBA	representatives 	therefore 	take	part	in	
supervisory 	college 	meetings. 	Supervisory	
colleges	 have	 now	 been	 established	 for	more	
than 	100	EU	cross-border 	banking 	groups.	
Germany 	is	the	consolidating 	supervisor	
(home 	supervisor) 	in	18	EU	supervisory 	col-
leges 	and	participates 	in	another 	24	EU	su-
pervisory 	colleges 	as	the	host	supervisor.16	
Another	 important	 function	 of	the	EBA	 is	its	
legally	 binding	 mediation	 role	 to	resolve	 dis-
putes 	between 	national 	supervisory 	author -
ities	in	the	supervision 	of	a	banking 	group	
with	EU-wide 	activities. 	In	addition, 	the	EBA	
is	to	support	 the	national	 supervisory	 author -
ities	in	times 	of	crisis. 	It	can,	however, 	also	
decide	 to	take	 its	own	 measures.	 In	the	event	
of	a	crisis, 	the	EBA	may	even, 	under 	certain	
circumstances, 	exercise 	its	power 	to	adopt	
decisions	 addressed	 to	individual	 institutions.	
It	may	 likewise	 make	 use	of	this	option	 in	its	
mediation	 role	and	in	monitoring	 compliance	
with	 EU	banking	 supervisory	 legislation.
The	EBA	 has	also	been	 equipped	 with	 greater	
regulatory	 powers	 than	 its	predecessor,	 CEBS.	
The	latter	 could	 only	 issue	 legally	 non-binding	
guidelines	 and	recommendations,	 albeit	 with	
a	caveat 	of	requiring 	an	explanation 	in	the	
event	 of	non-implementation	 (“comply	 or	ex-
plain”).
With 	the	entry 	into	force 	of	the	TFEU, 	the	
comitology, 	ie	the	system 	of	administrative	
and	expert 	committees 	within 	the	European	
Union, 	was	reorganised. 	In	order 	to	reduce	
the	abundance	 of	details	 and	thus	 the	length	of	negotiations	 in	legislative	 procedures,	 the	
Council	 of	Ministers	 and	 the	Parliament	 may	
use	a	legislative 	act	(eg	a	directive) 	to	dele-
gate	 to	the	Commission	 the	power	 to	adopt	
delegated	 acts	 pursuant	 to	Article	 290	 of	the	
TFEU.	 However,	 these	 legislative	 powers	 may	
be	exercised 	only	to	supplement 	or	amend	
non-essential 	elements 	of	a	legislative 	act.	
The	relevant 	legislative 	acts	explicitly 	lay	
down	 the	objectives,	 content,	 scope	 and	dur-
ation	 of	the	delegation	 of	power.	 In	principle,	
the	member	 states	 are	responsible	 for	imple -
menting 	the	legislative 	acts	and	must 	adopt	
the	necessary	 measures	 of	national	 law.	 How -
ever, 	where 	uniform 	conditions 	for	imple -
menting 	legally 	binding 	Union 	acts	are	
needed,	 pursuant	 to	Article	 291	of	the	TFEU,	
implementing 	powers 	may	be	conferred 	on	
the	Commission	 and	in	exceptional	 cases	 –	of	
no	relevance	 to	banking	 regulation	 –	on	the	
Council	 in	order	 to	ensure	 the	uniform	 appli -
cation 	of	a	basic 	legal 	instrument 	by	the	
member	 states.
In	banking	 supervision,	 the	EBA	 plays	 an	im-
portant	 role	in	this	process.	 The	EBA	 Regula -
tion	 states	 that	 the	EBA	 may,	 in	explicitly	 pre-
defined 	areas, 	elaborate 	draft 	technical	
standards 	which 	are	submitted 	to	the	Com -
mission	 for	endorsement	 in	the	form	 of	dele-
gated 	acts	or	implementing 	acts. 	Both 	the	
delegated	 acts	and	the	implementing	 acts	are	
then	 adopted	 by	means	 of	a	regulation	 or	de-
cision 	of	the	Commission 	and	therefore 	be-
come	 directly	 applicable	 law.	 Although	 these	Whereas CEBS

technical	 standards	 are	intended	 to	be	“only”	
supplements	 or	amendments	 to	non-essential	
elements 	of	a	legislative 	act,	they	have 	a	
clearly	 visible	 and	perceptible	 impact	 on	both	
supervisory 	practices 	and	credit 	institutions’	
activities.	 As	per	the	latest	 draft,	 the	propos -
als	for	a	directive	 and	 a	regulation	 to	imple -
ment	 Basel	 III	in	the	EU	allow	 for	108	 techni -
cal	standards17	relating 	to	numerous 	areas,	
for	instance,	 the	definition	 of	capital	 or	joint	risk	assessments	 and	 the	valuation	 of	capital	
in	the	supervisory	 colleges.
There 	are	two	types 	of	technical 	standards.	
The	EBA	 elaborates	 draft	 “regulatory	 techni -
cal	standards” 	and	submits 	these 	to	the	
Commission 	for	endorsement. 	The	Commis -
sion	may	not	change 	the	content 	of	a	draft	
regulatory 	technical 	standard 	without 	prior	
coordination 	with 	the	EBA. 	Indeed, 	such	
drafts 	should 	be	subject 	to	amendment 	by	
the	Commission 	only	in	very	restricted 	and	
extraordinary 	circumstances, 	as	the	EBA	is	
deemed	 to	be	the	actor	 in	close	 contact	 with	
and	knowing 	best	the	financial 	markets.18	
Where	 the	EBA	 has	submitted	 a	draft	 legisla -
tive	act	and	the	Commission 	has	adopted 	it	
without 	amendment, 	the	European 	Parlia -
ment 	and	the	Council 	have 	just	one	month	
to	object 	pursuant 	to	Article 	13	of	the	EBA	
Regulation.
Moreover,	 pursuant	 to	Article	 15	of	the	EBA	
Regulation, 	the	EBA	may	develop 	“imple -
menting 	technical 	standards.” 	There 	is	no	
limitation 	like	the	one	applicable 	to	regula -
tory	technical 	standards 	stating 	that	the	
Commission	 may	 make	 amendments	 only	 in	
very	restricted 	circumstances. 	In	the	area	of	
implementing 	technical 	standards, 	the	in-
volvement 	of	the	European 	Parliament 	and	
the	Council	 is	limited	 to	information	 rights.
The	special	 significance	 that	 technical	 stand -
ards	 have	 for	supervisory	 practices	 and	credit	
institutions’ 	activities 	is	reflected 	in	the	
decision-making 	procedure 	in	the	Board 	of	Regulatory

Supervisors. 	As	a	general 	rule,	decisions 	of	
the	Board	 of	Supervisors	 are	taken	 by	a	sim-
ple	majority	of	its	members,	with	each	voting	
member 	having 	one	vote. 	However, 	in	the	
case	of	decisions 	relating 	to	the	elaboration	
of	regulatory	 technical	 standards,	 implement -
ing	technical	 standards	 or	guidelines	 and	rec-
ommendations, 	votes 	are	weighted 	accord -
ing	to	Article	 16	(4)	of	the	Treaty	 on	European	
Union 	and	Protocol 	(No	36)	on	Transitional	
Provisions, 	thus	ensuring 	that	the	size	and	
economic	 power	 of	the	member	 states	 is	re-
flected	 in	the	voting	 (qualified	 majority).
The	EBA	 and	the	national	 supervisory	 author -
ities, 	as	part	of	the	ESFS, 	should 	work 	to-
gether 	to	further 	enhance 	cross-border 	su-
pervision	 and	regulation	 in	Europe.	 Attempts	
have 	been 	made 	to	balance 	the	rights 	and	
duties 	of	those 	involved. 	In	doing 	so,	the	
rights 	at	the	“European 	level” 	–	ie	those 	of	
the	EBA	–	have 	been 	extended, 	as	reflected	
in	the	tasks	 and	responsibilities	 as	well	 as	the	
powers 	to	issue 	instructions 	to	individual 	in-
stitutions 	outlined 	above. 	However, 	the	dic-
tate	that	the	fiscal 	sovereignty 	of	the	EU	
member 	states 	must 	be	guaranteed 	means	
that	basic 	responsibility 	for	banking 	supervi -
sion	 must	 remain	 at	the	national	 level,	 as	in-
cidentally 	also	reiterated 	by	the	European	
Council	 in	its	conclusions	 of	19 June	 2009.	 It	
stressed 	that	decisions 	taken 	by	the	ESAs	
should	 not	impinge	 on	the	fiscal	 responsibil-
ities	of	member 	states.19	This	demand 	is	
spelled 	out	in	Article 	38	of	the	EBA	Regula -
tion,	 which	 states	 that	 decisions	 taken	 by	the	
EBA	pursuant 	to	Article 	18	(action 	in	emer -
gency 	situations) 	and	Article 	19	(settlement	of	disagreements) 	must 	not	impinge 	on	
member	 states’	 fiscal	 responsibilities.
The	challenge 	inherent 	in	this	concept 	is	to	
find	 an	appropriate	 balance	 between	 a	Euro-
pean 	authority 	equipped 	with	both 	quasi-
legislative 	powers 	and	the	right 	to	issue 	in-
structions	 to	individual	 institutions	 under	 cer-
tain	circumstances,	 and	the	fact	that	 ultimate	
responsibility 	for	all	measures 	taken 	lies	at	
the	national 	level. 	With 	this	in	mind 	and	in	
order 	to	increase 	acceptance, 	it	is	therefore	
very	important 	that	the	work 	of	the	EBA	is	
largely 	based 	on	the	contributions 	of	the	
member	 states,	 despite	 it	being	 an	independ -
ent	EU	authority. 	This	must 	be	the	case	not	
merely	 when	 decisions	 are	taken	 by	the	Board	
of	Supervisors, 	but	must 	also	apply 	and	be	
practiced 	in	the	preliminary 	stages 	of	the	
substructures	 (members-driven	 approach).
In	closely 	tying 	in	national 	supervisory 	au-
thorities, 	national 	particularities 	can	also	be	
taken	 into	consideration	 –	as	stipulated	 in	the	
recitals 	of	the	EBA	Regulation. 	The	need 	for	
greater 	harmonisation 	of	EU	supervisory 	le-
gislation 	towards 	a	single 	rulebook 	and	
greater 	coherence 	in	ongoing 	supervision	
across 	national 	borders 	is	acknowledged 	in	
principle. 	However, 	judgement 	needs 	to	be	
exercised	 in	practice.

legal	 nature	 needs	 to	be	taken	 into	 account.	
For	instance,	 the	standards	 negotiated	 in	the	
Basel	 Committee	 are	legally	 non-binding	 rec-
ommendations. 	However, 	the	results 	of	the	
European 	legislative 	process 	are	binding 	for	
German 	legislators 	and	generally 	reflect	
agreements 	reached 	at	the	international	
level.
As	mentioned	 above,	 the	implementation	 of	
CRD	IV	is	slightly 	different 	in	that	the	Com -
mission	 proposal	 envisages	 a	combination	 of	
a	directive	 and	a	regulation.20	A	combination	
of	this	kind	requires 	considerable 	amend -
ments	 to	the	applicable	 German	 legal	 frame -
work, 	specifically 	the	Banking 	Act	(Kredit -
wesengesetz) ,	the	Solvency 	Regulation	
(Solvabilitätsverordnung) 	and	the	Liquidity	
Regulation 	(Liquiditätsverordnung) .	As	a	
regu 	lation 	has	general 	application 	pursuant	
to	Article 	288	second 	subparagraph 	of	the	
TFEU,	 it	is	binding	 in	its	entirety	 and	 directly	
applicable	 in	all	member	 states.	 Transposition	
into	 national	 legislation	 is	therefore	 not	only	
unnecessary, 	it	is	actually 	not	permissible	
(prohibition 	of	implementation).21	National	
legislation	 that	 runs	 counter	 to	the	provisions	
of	a	regulation 	must 	be	amended 	to	avoid	
ambiguities.22
Consequently, 	any	provisions 	that, 	in	future,	
are	to	be	covered 	by	the	regulation 	must 	in	
principle 	be	removed 	from 	German 	banking	
supervision	 law.	 However,	 the	CRD	 IV	regula -
tion	 applies	 only	 to	credit	 institutions	 and	in-
vestment	 firms,	 and	therefore	 does	 not	cover	
all	institutions 	within 	the	meaning 	of	the	
German	 Banking	 Act.	 This	raises	 the	question	
of	the	extent 	to	which 	the	requirements 	of	the	regulation	 should	 also	 apply	 to	the	other	
institutions 	governed 	by	the	Banking 	Act.	
The	regulation 	must 	thus	either 	be	declared	
to	be	applicable 	to	these 	institutions 	too	or	
the	relevant	 German	 legal	 provisions	 must	 be	
amended.
By	contrast, 	the	provisions 	laid	down 	in	the	
directive	 must	 be	transposed	 into	 German	 le-
gislation 	before	 they	become 	directly	 applic -
able.	 Here	 too,	 deviations	 are	allowed	 only	 in	
individual 	cases, 	namely 	to	safeguard 	finan -
cial	stability 	or	where 	required 	by	an	institu -
tion’s	 specific	 risk	profile.
As	outlined	 above,	 the	EBA	 elaborates	 regu-
latory 	technical 	standards 	or	implementing	
technical	 standards	 that	 are	endorsed	 by	the	
Commission	 in	the	form	 of	regulations	 or	de-
cisions.23	In	this	context,	 there	 is	no	provision	
for	the	issue 	of	directives. 	The	technical	
standards 	therefore 	have 	direct 	effect; 	na-
tional	 implementation	 is	not	permissible.
In	addition, 	the	EBA	–	like	CEBS 	before 	it	–	
can	issue 	guidelines 	and	recommendations	
pursuant 	to	Article 	16	of	the	EBA	Regula -
tion.24	Although	 these	 guidelines	 and	recom -
mendations 	are	not	legally 	binding, 	national	
authorities	 must	 make	 every	 effort	 to	comply	
with	them 	or	must, 	if	they	fail	to	do	so,	in-
form	 the	EBA,	 stating	 their	 reasons.	 The	EBA	
will	also	 publish	 this	fact.	 This	 “comply	 or	ex-
plain”	 mechanism	 is	intended	 to	increase	 the	International 
recommenda-tions and standards not legally binding, but European legal frame-work is binding for member states
