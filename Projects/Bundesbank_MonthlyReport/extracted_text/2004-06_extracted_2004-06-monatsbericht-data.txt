5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeThe discernible upturn in the economy during
the second half of 2003 became somewhatstronger in the first quarter of this year. Afterseasonal and working-day adjustment, realgross domestic product (GDP) was 0.4% upon the final quarter of 2003. Adjusted forvariations in the number of working days, theyear-on-year figure showed a 0.7% increasein overall output, compared with 0.1% in au-tumn 2003. In calendar-month terms, therewas a 1.5% increase compared with 0.2% inthe preceding period. The stimuli to growthwere generated solely by foreign trade andpayments, however. Exports rose sharply fol-lowing a temporary lull, clearly overtaking theincrease in imports. By contrast, there was aweakening of domestic demand. In particular,there was a decline in investment in machin-ery and equipment as well as in investment inconstruction. Households’ consumption stag-nated and the propensity to save remained ata relatively high level.
IndustryOutput and orders received in April suggest a
continuation of the upturn in the industrialsector. Seasonally adjusted output showed aclear rise on the preceding months, eventhough there is likely to be a sharp down-ward revision of the provisional figures. Theyear-on-year increase, which was just under2% in the second quarter, continued to grow.Capital goods producers, in particular,stepped up their production. ConsumerGDP

6goods producers also increased their output,
however. Taking turnover as a yardstick, in-dustrial exports remained to the fore in April.Nevertheless, domestic sales were also ex-panded somewhat.
Export demand for German industrial goods
also expanded in early spring. At around+9
1/C252%, the year-on-year increase in April
was more than twice as large as in the firstquarter. Producers of consumer goods, in par-ticular, recorded a marked seasonally adjustedincrease in orders. Moreover, orders for inter-mediate goods were comparatively buoyant.The intake of domestic orders, which hadbeen largely stagnant during the first fewmonths of the year, picked up as well, albeitwith a quite moderate-average increase.Construction
The situation in the construction sector re-
mained unfavourable throughout the report-ing period. There was a slight seasonally ad-justed rise in construction output in April butthe level of production was still very low evenafter factoring in a positive revision which isto be expected along with the overall survey.Compared with 2003, which was alreadyweak, the figures available at present signal adecline of nearly one-tenth.
Construction orders received (for which data
are available up to the end of the first quar-ter) fell to a new low in March in seasonallyadjusted terms. The figure for the first quarteras a whole was 4% down on the year. Therewas an above-average decline in housingconstruction orders. This was connected withshortfalls after orders had been brought for-ward owing to the cutback in governmentassistance. Developments in public sectorordering were not much more favourable. Bycontrast, industrial orders on an average ofthe period from January to March were onlyslightly lower than 12 months earlier. In say-ing that, however, it should be noted thatconstruction activity had already fallen to avery low level in the same period last year.
Labour marketThe labour market continued to be character-
ised by declining employment and a rise inunemployment. The fall in the number of per-sons in work accelerated again after the startof 2004 following a temporary slowdown inthe final quarter of last year. In March (moreOverall economic growth

7recent data are unavailable), the seasonally
adjusted number of persons in work was38.12 million, ie around 75,000 fewer thanat the end of 2003, or 150,000 fewer year onyear.
The seasonally adjusted number of persons
officially registered as unemployed had risento 4.37 million by May. This was almost10,000 more than in April. This was 50,000lower than in the comparable period last yearbut this was due solely to the non-inclusionof participants in aptitude tests and trainingschemes from January 2004 onwards. Exclud-ing such persons from the previous year’s fig-ures would produce a year-on-year increaseof almost 30,000 in the unemployment fig-ure. The seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate as calculated by the Federal EmploymentAgency persisted at 10.5% in May. Thestandardised rate remained at 9.8%.
PricesConsumer prices showed a further rise in
May although the pace of increase sloweddown in seasonally adjusted terms. The factthat the year-on-year rate of increase wentup to 2% from 1.6% in April was due solelyto the marked rise in prices for refined petrol-eum products. The increase on the yearwidened to more than one-tenth owing tothe fact that there had been falls in prices inMay 2003. Excluding energy, the rate of priceincrease remained constant in May at 1.5%.The clearly higher price rise of 2.4% for ser-vices was offset to a considerable extent byfood prices being 0.2% lower.Economic conditions in Germany*

8International oil prices, which had risen to a
new high in early June, have eased down-wards somewhat in the past few weeks. Ataround US$35 for a barrel of Brent North SeaOil, the price nevertheless remained at a highlevel. Numerous industrial raw materials alsofell in price. According to the HWWA index,the trend reversed in April. The year-on-yearrate of price increase showed a slight fall forthe first time in almost a year. There was aseasonally adjusted rise in both German im-port prices and industrial producer prices inApril. The year-on-year rates at the end of theperiod under review were +0.4% and +0.9%respectively.
Public finances
Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
In April, the indebtedness of central, state
and local government rose by only 30.5 bil-
lion. This was mainly as a result of develop-ments in central government, which reducedits liabilities by 33.9 billion in total. Redemp-
tions of money market loans amounting to37.5 billion were offset by net borrowing on
the capital market of 33.6 billion. The out-
standing amount of two-year Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) expanded by 36.6 billion in the light
of the topping-up of the securities issued inMarch. Compared with the previous month,the financing conditions for central govern-ment worsened by one-quarter percentagepoint. The volume of outstanding bonds wasreduced by 31.1 billion as a result of market
management operations. There was a 30.8billion decline in the outstanding amount of
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) since the vol-ume of maturing securities was not matchedby monthly tender allotment and marketmanagement operations. Loans against bor-rowers’ notes and Federal savings notes wereeach redeemed to the value of 30.5 billion on
balance.
By contrast, the indebtedness of state gov-
ernment increased by 34.1 billion. It drew pri-
marily on cash advances amounting to 32.6
billion. 30.9 billion net was raised through
Treasury notes. The gross volume of issuesamounted to 32.9 billion. The largest individ-
ual issue ( 31 billion) was launched by the
state of Hesse in the form of a ten-year secur-ity with a 4% coupon. The issue of short-term securities raised a further 30.5 billion forNet borrowing in the market

9state government on balance. In the case of
the special funds, liabilities went down by30.2 billion, but the indebtedness of local
government is likely to have increased mar-ginally again.
Central government borrowingIn May, central government liabilities in-
creased again sharply by 35.8 billion. This
development was, however, offset by a 33.3
billion increase in deposits on the money mar-ket. Whereas money market loans were re-deemed to the value of 31.3 billion, borrow-
ing on the capital market went up by 37.2 bil-
lion. Gross borrowing totalled 319.4 billion.
The largest sum was raised through bonds.The tender allotment of a newly issued ten-year security with a 4.25% coupon raised37.7 billion alone. However, the financing
conditions for central government worsenedby one-quarter percentage point to an aver-age yield of 4.34% compared with the lastissue in February, which means that therewas a discount of almost 0.8%. A Treuhandagency bond with a volume of 34.1 billion
and a coupon of 6.75% matured in Maymeaning that – including market manage-ment operations – the outstanding amountof bonds rose by 33.1 billion. The monthly
issue of six-month Bubills alone raised 34.9
billion. The average yield exceeded the 2%mark for the first time since December. Ifmarket management operations are includedand redemptions of a maturing security arededucted, the outstanding amount rose by31.1 billion. The third larger issue (a tender al-
lotment of 34.6 billion) was the second
topping-up of five-year Federal notes (Bobls)of the series 144, which have an interest rate
of 3.25%. Compared with the first topping-up in March, the average issue yield went upby four-tenths of a percentage point to3.53%, which meant a discount of almost1.3%. After deducting repurchases and re-demptions of a security with the same cou-pon and a volume of 31.5 billion which was
issued in 1999, the amount outstanding in-creased by 32.9 billion. In addition, 30.5 bil-
lion was raised through market managementoperations in the case of Sch/C228tze, whilst theoutstanding amount of Federal savings notesdeclined by a further 30.2 billion.Net borrowing in the market by central

10Securities markets
Bond marketThe issue volume in the German bond market
went back down slightly in April. At 394.8 bil-
lion, the market value of debt securities is-sued by domestic borrowers was lower thanin March ( 3117.4 billion). After deducting re-
demptions and adjusting for changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds, net sales,at321.2 billion, were down on the previous
month ( 326.9 billion). Sales of foreign bonds
and notes in Germany raised 39.0 billion net.
Most of the funds raised accrued to credit in-
stitutions in April. They raised 314.7 billion in
the bond market – less than in the previousmonth ( 320.8 billion). On balance, only other
bank debt securities ( 38.7 billion) and bonds
issued by special-purpose banks ( 37.3 billion)
were sold. This contrasted with net redemp-tions of mortgage Pfandbriefe and publicPfandbriefe totalling 30.2 billion and 31.1 bil-
lion respectively.
In April, the public sector increased its bond
market debt by 33.8 billion, ie to a far lesser
extent than in previous months. As in March,central government, which borrowed 35.2
billion in the bond market, accounted formost of this debt. It issued only two-yearFederal Treasury notes ( 36.8 billion) and re-
deemed 30.5 billion worth of Federal savings
notes. In addition, a bond issued by the for-mer Federal Post Office worth 33.1 billion
was redeemed in April. The federal states is-sued far fewer debt securities ( 31.7 billion)
than in the preceding months.In April enterprises borrowed 32.7 billion in
the domestic capital market. Commercialpaper accounted for 32.1 billion and longer-
term corporate bonds for 30.6 billion. In
March enterprises had slightly reduced theiruse of these two instruments for borrowingin the market.
Foreign investors were the main purchasers
of domestic debt securities in April. Theyadded 317.8 billion to their portfolios, far
more than in the previous month ( 312.0 bil-
lion). Domestic credit institutions came insecond, at 311.1 billion; this figure was split
almost evenly between domestic and foreignbonds. Domestic non-banks bought 33.5 bil-
lion net of foreign debt securities and sold32.2 billion worth of German paper.Sales and purchases

11Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
revived in April. Domestic enterprises placednew shares with a market value of 33.4 bil-
lion in the month under review, following30.3 billion in March. However, 33.0 billion of
this figure was accounted for by a major Ger-man bank’s capital increase. At the sametime, the volume of foreign equities in circula-tion fell by 33.7 billion. On balance, domestic
investors were the sole purchasers of sharesissued by German enterprises. Credit institu-tions purchased 315.5 billion worth of debt in
the German equity markets, and non-banks311.6 billion. By contrast, foreign investors
sold 323.7 billion net of German equities.
Mutual fund sharesDomestic mutual funds sold 31.5 billion of
their own shares in April as against 33.9 bil-
lion a month earlier. Most of the income fromthese sales accrued to specialised funds (theexclusive preserve of institutional investors),which accumulated an additional 31.2 billion.
By contrast, the amount outstanding ofshares in mutual funds open to the generalpublic rose only slightly, by 30.3 billion.
Open-end real estate funds and mixed fundsreceived inflows of 30.4 and 30.2 respect-
ively. That was offset, however, by the out-flows of 30.3 billion and 30.1 billion from
share-based funds and money market fundsrespectively, in a continuation of the previousmonths’ pattern. The amount outstanding ofshares in bond-based funds remained un-changed, on balance. Sales of foreign mutualfund shares, at 31.6 billion net, were down
from their March levels.
Domestic non-banks, in particular, played a
major role as purchasers of shares in residentand non-resident mutual funds. Much as inthe preceding month, they added a total of32.9 billion worth of fund shares to their
portfolios. By contrast, German credit institu-tions increased their portfolio holdings ofmutual fund shares by only 30.4 billion net.
Foreign investors divested themselves of 30.2
billion worth of domestic fund shares.
Balance of payments
In April 2004, the German current account
recorded a surplus of 310.2 billion. In the pre-
vious month, the surplus had been 33.1 bil-
lion larger. The decrease in the trade surplusand increase in the deficit on invisible currenttransactions – which comprise services, factorincome and current transfers – contributedtowards this fall.
The foreign trade surplus fell in April – ac-
cording to provisional figures from the Fed-eral Statistical Office – by 31.9 billion com-
pared with March to 314.6 billion. After ad-
justment for seasonal variations, however,the trade surplus went up by 31
1/C252billion to
315 billion. This rise can be traced back to the
increase in exports of goods, which wasgreater than the increase in imports of goods.Seasonally-adjusted exports in April exceededthe previous month’s level by 5% whereasimports went up by only 4%. In the com-bined February to April period, exports there-Share sales and

preceding three months. By contrast, only aslight rise was recorded in the value of im-ports in a three-month comparison (+
1/C252%),
which, furthermore, was almost exclusivelydue to prices.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
went up in April by 31.3 billion to 34.1 billion.
The cause of the larger deficit was primarilylower net income from cross-border factor in-come. The surplus on factor income amount-ed to just 30.8 billion in April compared with
32.1 billion in the previous month (the March
value was revised upwards by 32.0 billion).
The deficit on services also increased by 30.8
billion to 33.2 billion. By contrast, net ex-
penditure in the case of current transfers fellby30.7 billion to 31.7 billion.
In April, portfolio investment recorded out-
flows of funds, which, at 312.5 billion, were
around twice as great as in the previousmonth. Net capital exports were distributedroughly equally across cross-border invest-ment by German and foreign investors. Ger-man investors bought mainly foreign bondsand notes ( 38.1 billion), especially euro-
denominated debt securities. They also ac-quired a small amount of investment fundcertificates and money market paper whereasthey sold shares issued by foreign borrowersfor the second month in a row ( 34.1 billion
compared with 31.6 billion in March). Foreign
investors sold German shares to an evengreater extent ( 323.6 billion). By contrast,
they acquired public and private bonds wortha total of 320.7 billion.Major items of the balance

13In the case of direct investment, a compara-
tively small volume of capital was exported(32.3 billion). There were outflows of funds
from the German branches of foreign firms(33.2 billion compared with 310.1 billion in
March). German proprietors also reducedtheir cross-border investment, albeit to a veryminor extent ( 31.0 billion). Enterprises’ in-
ternal loan repayments played a decisive rolein this.
There were marginal net outflows of capital
through the non-securitised credit transac-tions of non-banks in April ( 30.8 billion).
These outflows can essentially be traced backto the transactions of German enterprisesand individuals. In addition, monetary finan-cial institutions (excluding the Bundesbank)recorded outflows of funds amounting to323.8 billion whereas 30.9 billion accrued to
the Bundesbank – primarily through reducedclaims in the payment system TARGET.

action values – rose slightly in April ( 30.6 bil-

15Monetary policy
under uncertaintyUncertainty is an integral element
of many economic decisions, especiallythose extending into the future.Monetary policy geared to price stabil-ity is also faced with considerable un-certainty. A distinction can be madebetween model uncertainty and datauncertainty. Data uncertainty denotesincompleteness and inadequacy ofinformation on economic variables.Model uncertainty, however, refers toa lack of knowledge of the exact trans-mission mechanism in the economy.
This article describes these forms of
uncertainty and analyses their conse-quences for monetary policy decision-making. It finds that data uncertaintyfurther increases the risks associatedwith attempts to fine-tune the eco-nomic cycle. Monetary policy decisionmakers should therefore exercise cau-tion regarding uncertain data and takeaccount of a broad range of relevantinformation in order to avoid policyerrors in this field. The best way formonetary policy makers to deal withmodel uncertainty is to base theirdecisions on a monetary policy strategywhich achieves satisfactory resultsacross a broad range of competingmodels.

16economic variables is characterised by long
time-lags. Interest rate decisions are thereforeby their very nature forward-looking. In theEurosystem, which – like the Bundesbank be-fore it – is clearly committed to the primaryobjective of price stability, decision makersare chiefly interested in counteracting me-dium to long-term risks to price stability at anearly stage.
However, there is generally considerable un-
certainty surrounding the future developmentof the target variable and the exact impact ofmonetary policy instrument variables on thetarget variable, and even surrounding thestate of the economy when the decision isbeing made. The uncertainty factors faced bycentral banks are myriad and interdependent.They are created by, for instance, competitionbetween different theoretical models, con-stant structural change and the limited avail-ability and reliability of key economic data.
Forms of uncertainty
In this context, it makes sense to draw a dis-
tinction between data uncertainty and modeluncertainty. Data uncertainty denotes incom-plete and unreliable information about eco-nomic developments up to the current obser-vation period. Model uncertainty refers tolimited knowledge of the transmission mech-anism and therefore to the choice of datarelevant to monetary policy and their inter-pretation.Model uncertainty
In order to analyse economic phenomena,
economists generally need to simplify com-plex realities. Such simplifications, which donot necessarily have to be formalistic, aregenerally referred to as “models”.
Monetary policy makers need models to gain
an idea of future price movements and togauge the impact of their own monetary pol-icy measures. The models they use must ad-equately represent the relevant structural re-lationships between the price level, the mon-etary policy instruments and other factors af-fecting price movements. These other factorsinclude, for instance, changes in oil prices orexchange rates as well as the introduction ofnew technologies or changes in the politicaland institutional framework.
Since models simplify reality, they can only
stress specific relationships while disregardingothers. However, the question of which rela-tionships are actually “relevant” and whichsimplifications are “adequate” is certainly acontentious one. Accordingly, there oftenexist competing theoretical models which ex-plain the same phenomenon, differing interms of the selection of explicitly includedvariables and the type of interrelatedness butalso in terms of other core assumptions, suchas the way expectations are formed.
This becomes a problem for the monetary
policy maker if the relevant models character-ise the current situation differently and/orsuggest differing monetary policy actions. It istherefore possible, for example, that an as-

17sessment of the price outlook based on the
quantity theory, which emphasises the long-term relationship between monetary growthand inflation, may lead to a policy recommen-dation that is at odds with the results of acorresponding analysis based on a Phillipscurve model, which stresses the link betweeninflation and unemployment or overall cap-acity utilisation.
But, even if economists were able to agree on
the appropriate model, the next step wouldbe to determine the values of the model’sparameters, which provide information onthe strength and dynamics of the relationshipbetween the individual variables. Since, as ageneral rule, parameter values can only be es-timated based on an empirical analysis, theresults will be subject to an inherent statisticaluncertainty. Moreover, the results will alsodepend on the choice of the estimationmethod. Policy makers are thus faced with aninterlocking system of different forms ofmodel uncertainty, with uncertainty aboutthe adequate theoretical model being joinedby uncertainty about which empirical modelis suited to adequately quantify the relation-ships being studied.
In addition, theoretical models are often not
very precise in how they define the key vari-ables. It thus remains unclear for the mostpart how to operationalise the “moneystock” variable or “price level” variable usedin a theoretical model for the empirical analy-sis. This problem is also significant in light ofthe fact that different operationalisations (egusing M1 instead of M3 to measure money orusing the GDP deflator instead of the CPI tomeasure the price level) can lead to different
results regarding the strength and dynamicsof the estimated relationships.
The fact that empirical models can only cap-
ture basic features and behaviour patternsduring a certain estimation period in the pastremains a problem. The choice of observationperiod can, under some circumstances, havea considerable impact on the estimation re-sult, especially if the relationships in questionhave changed fundamentally at some pointin time.
This problem is particularly severe regarding
the assessment of the economic situation atthe current end of the data, since such“structural breaks” can often not be detectedin a timely manner by econometric tests. Andeven if a regime shift has been detected, theparameters of the new structure cannot becaptured with sufficient precision shortly afterthe break, owing to the small number of ob-servations.
It goes almost without saying that the extent
of uncertainty about macroeconomic rela-tionships in the euro area has been, and con-tinues to be, especially large. After an eventas pivotal as the establishment of a monetaryunion between eleven nation-states, the like-lihood of structural breaks will grow, andtheir impact on the monetary transmissionprocess will initially be nearly impossible togauge empirically because of the above-mentioned problems.
In addition, empirical analyses for the euro

18of comparable data which should also go
back sufficiently far into the past. Long seriesof harmonised data, however, only exist for avery few key variables such as the M1, M2and M3 monetary aggregates. For otherareas, it is necessary to fall back on non-har-monised data for the period prior to monet-ary union, provided such data are available inthe first place. In that case, model uncertaintyand parameter uncertainty are amplifiedfurther by the inadequacy of the data.
Data uncertaintyAlong with the problem of model uncertainty
described above, in practice there is also theproblem of data uncertainty. This kind of un-certainty arises because the relevant statistics(economic, financial and monetary statistics)provide incomplete or unreliable informationabout the “true” state of the economy.
The underlying data can be incomplete for
several reasons. One possible reason is thatnot all data which are relevant to analysingthe economic situation are statistically collect-ed. Another reason is that some data whichare collected are available only after a certaintime-lag. In addition, some key data (especial-ly real economic data) are subject to measure-ment problems, due to which the initiallyavailable data end up being revised over time.
Although gaps in collected data are a prob-
lem shared by just about all central banks,they particularly affect the Eurosystem. Thedata needed by the Eurosystem must not onlybe timely and reliable but also comparableacross all participating countries. As this prob-lem was known to all participants, major ef-
forts were undertaken even prior to monetaryunion to ensure the provision of sufficientlyharmonised data, at least in the most import-ant spheres of activity, once monetary unionwas launched. As regards the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices (HICP) and the dataon monetary aggregates, this endeavour hasbeen largely successful. By contrast, however,data on some key indicators in the areas ofbusiness cycle statistics and labour marketstatistics are not yet available as harmoniseddata. There are, for instance, no euro-areamonthly employment statistics or quarterlylabour volume calculations.
The New Orders Index for the euro area,
which Eurostat has been publishing sinceNovember 2003, is a further example of theparticular data problems facing the euro area.Although its publication represents progressas such, the new statistics, unlike the match-ing German statistics, cannot be brokendown into domestic and foreign orders, nor isit possible to calculate a volume series, sinceproducer prices are not calculated for foreignsales in most euro-area countries.

In addition, many key data, especially fromthe real sector, are available only with a time-lag of several weeks (if not months). For in-stance, Eurostat presents a flash estimate ofaggregate output in the euro area six weeksafter the end of the quarter under review.Around two months later, this is followed bya first estimate of production, broken downmore precisely into components. But even

19then, data may still be expected to undergo
a process of at times considerable revisionwhich may last years (see adjacent chart).
Besides the above cited problems of availabil-
ity, timeliness and reliability of the underlyingdata, an additional type of data uncertaintyexists. It occurs because many variables whichplay a decisive role in theoretical models can-not be observed directly in the real world andtherefore have to be estimated. The estima-tion results, for their part, are strongly de-pendent on the underlying model. This showshow closely intertwined data uncertainty andmodel uncertainty are.
That applies to the calculation of equilibrium
exchange rates as well as to determining the“natural” or equilibrium level of interest ratesor the adequate valuation of assets. The mostprominent examples of this, however, are un-doubtedly potential output and the outputgap, the latter defined as the deviation of realoutput from potential output. A number ofrecently published research papers haveshown that estimates of potential output andtherefore also of the output gap are fraughtwith considerable uncertainty, which is re-flected also in the fact that the relevant timeseries are often revised years, if not evendecades, later. This is due not so much to revi-sions in the data used for the estimations butto the fundamental difficulty inherent incorrectly estimating an economy’s growthtrend – and especially changes in this trend.Since such trend reversals are simply anotherexample of the structural breaks describedabove, this is another region in which the

21boundary between data uncertainty and
model uncertainty becomes blurry.
As a case in point, until well into the 1980s it
was not clear to what extent the oil priceshocks of the 1970s had reduced potentialoutput and the trend growth rate of de-veloped industrial nations. This uncertaintyapparently peaked in early 1975. Orphanides’research has shown that estimates of the USeconomy’s output gap for early 1975, whichwere originally -16%, were gradually revisedupwards by over 10 percentage points in thefollowing years.
2Similar studies for the UK
and German economies show that the outputgap figures were revised to a similar extent inthose countries (see chart on page 20).
3
Another case in point is the discussion aboutthe “New Economy”. In this case, uncertaintyabout whether, and by how much, the tech-nology boom of the late 1990s really pushedthe US economy’s trend growth rate upwardsis likely to persist for some time.
These examples indicate how difficult it is to
assess the economic situation at the point intime when monetary policy decisions need tobe taken. Furthermore, they illustrate theconnection between data uncertainty andmodel uncertainty. Consequently, the suitabil-ity of a theoretical model to monetary policydecision-making depends not only on howwell it can explain past observations but alsoon the extent to which the data necessary forthe model’s empirical application are reliableand available in real time.Consequences for monetary policy
decision-making
Central banks face a dilemma: they must
take timely decisions while having only provi-sional, and thus often incomplete, data. Inaddition, there exists uncertainty about as-sessing the future and about the impact of agiven measure. This raises the question as towhat lessons monetary policy makers shouldlearn from the various forms of uncertainty.
Rejecting fine-tuningThe realisation that the transmission of mon-
etary policy stimuli to real income and pricesis associated with major uncertainty owing tolong and variable time-lags led Milton Fried-man to argue as early as 1961 against usingmonetary policy instruments in an attempt tofine-tune the economy.
4He held that, given
uncertainty about the time-span between amonetary policy measure and the occurrenceof its impact on the target variable, fine-tun-ing the economy carries with it the danger ofamplifying the business cycle. Accordingly, aninterest rate cut designed to jump-start aflagging economy might only exert its fulleffect when the economy has already re-turned to maximum capacity utilisation. In

22that case, the monetary policy measure
would exert undesirable inflationary pressure.What makes reservations about fine-tuningthe economy all the more severe is that esti-mates of potential output, in particular, arefraught with considerable uncertainty.
Recent research papers by Orphanides and
others have shown that these problems mustby no means be underestimated. The overlyoptimistic view of the US economy’s potentialoutput in the 1970s was probably a key rea-son for the US Federal Reserve’s excessivelyexpansionary (from today’s perspective) mon-etary policy, which was only halted as the1970s reached their close. Similar researchbased on data for the United Kingdom like-wise concludes that the high inflation rates ofthe 1970s and 1980s were due at least inpart to policy errors based on the persistentoverestimation of aggregate potential out-put.
5
Germany’s lower inflation rates during thisperiod suggest that the Bundesbank succeed-ed in avoiding these types of policy errors.A relatively new research paper examines thishypothesis by analysing the Bundesbank’sinterest rate decisions on the basis not ofrevised data but of those data available todecision makers in “real time”, ie when thedecision was made.
6The paper concludes
that the relative success of the Bundesbank’spolicy is not due to the fact that Germany’sdata were less prone to revision than those ofother countries. Apparently, the more decisivefactor was that the Bundesbank did not baseits decisions so much on the current level ofthe output gap as on monetary growth andreal economic growth. Furthermore, it at-
tached much weight to its assessment of ex-pected price developments, which was basedon these and other indicators.
“Steady-as-she-goes monetary policy”The less certain the environment, the greater
the danger, naturally, that decisions mayprove to be wrong in retrospect. Such policyerrors create problems, not only because theylead to direct and undesirable effects on thetarget variables but also because they in-crease the probability of frequent changes indirection. Such “back and forth” movementswould jeopardise the central bank’s credibility,contribute to existing uncertainty and desta-bilise expectations.
Early on, the literature called for partial or
gradual monetary policy reactions to incom-ing information in order to avoid such ef-fects.
7It had been recognised that uncer-
tainty about the real income or price effectsof monetary policy increases in line with thestrength of the monetary policy measure.
More recent studies conclude that data
uncertainty strengthens the case for a morecautious monetary policy approach. They as-sert that monetary policy should not reactnearly as strongly to the initial publication ofrevision-prone data as it would have without

23data uncertainty.8Furthermore, they recom-
mend not incorporating preliminary statisticalinformation on revision-prone variables, suchas GDP , at face value into monetary policy de-cisions, but instead to make a more broadly-based estimate of such variables. This esti-mate should also avail itself of informationfrom other, less revision-prone sources, aswell as of the past history of revisions to thevariable in question. Along those lines, thereis now a battery of research papers whichassert that money stock data can make avaluable contribution to monetary policy byproviding important information on the“true” level of real income. In contrast todata on aggregate income, they have the ad-vantage of being available with little time-lagand needing virtually no revision.
9
Taking all relevant information intoaccount
The problem of data uncertainty generally
suggests that, when assessing risks to pricestability, policymakers should not concentrateon only one indicator variable, but insteadshould analyse as wide a range of informa-tion variables as possible. Under such anapproach, the importance of individual dataused in the monetary policy decision-makingprocess also depends on how serious theirmeasurement errors are compared to otherrelevant variables. Taken in isolation, this ar-gument speaks in favour of attributing lessimportance to real economic variables suchas output and the output gap than to indica-tors from the monetary and financial spherethat are far less affected by the problem ofdata uncertainty (see chart on page 24).Data quality, however, cannot serve as the
sole criterion for choosing which indicators touse. Rather, the usefulness of an indicator formonetary policy purposes depends, above all,on how reliably it flags risks to price stability.If uncertainty exists about the stability of therelationship between a given indicator vari-able and the ultimate monetary policy object-ive – which will almost always be the case inthe real world – this also reduces the informa-tive value of this indicator for future pricemovements.
The quantity theory and the Phillips curve, as
two competing approaches to explaining in-flation, provide a good example of the tensionbetween data uncertainty and model uncer-tainty. A criticism of the quantity theory oftenvoiced in the more recent literature is that therelationship between monetary growth andinflation (even if it is stable over the longterm) is distorted by short-term fluctuationsin the velocity of circulation of money. In de-fence of the quantity theory, it can be saidthat the mismeasurement of the output gapcan be just as problematical in quantitativeterms as fluctuations in the velocity of circula-tion of money.
10Against that background, it
may make quite a lot of sense for decisionmakers to contrast the results produced bythe two approaches and to test them fortheir informative value in terms of future

Robustness of the monetary policy
strategy
Some academics have therefore also proposed
measuring the usefulness of a monetary policystrategy in terms of its robustness against al-ternative specifications of the monetary trans-mission process. Accordingly, central banksshould opt for a strategy that obtains suffi-ciently good results under various assump-tions regarding the transmission process.
In the past few years, a number of simulation
studies have sought to find out which strat-egy is robust in this regard. Most of them ad-vocate a (modified) Taylor rule monetary pol-icy, which links the nominal interest rate tocurrent inflation and business cycle data.
11
However, since these studies largely disregardthe problem of data uncertainty, their valuefor practical monetary policy is rather limited.In principle, this approach could be supple-mented by an analysis of data uncertainty.Under this extended approach, a strategythat attains good results despite data uncer-tainty and model uncertainty would be con-sidered robust.
12
As already discussed, the problems in estimat-ing potential output provide a strong argu-ment against using strategies that give aprominent role to the current level of the out-put gap. More recent research therefore pro-poses that central banks take less account ofthe output gap and devote more attention in-stead to the growth rate of real income.
13However, it is too early to judge this hypo-thesis conclusively.
Avoiding extremely unfavourable
developments
The arguments listed thus far generally favour
a non-activist, cautious monetary policy.However, it is pointed out in the literaturethat this is not always the adequate reactionto uncertainty. Rather, there may conceivablybe cases in which waiting is inappropriate be-cause it would lead to situations that gener-ate major macroeconomic costs. For instance,if an economy is in danger of slipping into aself-reinforcing deflationary spiral which isvery difficult to combat using the availablepolicy instruments,
14hesitation by monetary
policy makers could make matters worse. Inorder to hedge against the worst conceivablecase in such a situation, policymakers may berequired to act quickly and decisively despite– or precisely because of – the high uncer-tainty.

26In technical terms, uncertainty under such cir-
cumstances can be so great that no probabil-ity of occurrence can be associated with theconceivable scenarios any more, rendering itimpossible for monetary policy to be orientedto the expected aggregate benefit. In thiscase of extreme uncertainty, the “robust con-trol” approach recommends choosing thatparticular monetary policy which avoids theworst-case scenario. It can thus be regardedas an insurance policy against the worst case.
A problem with this, though, is that the mon-
etary policy decision depends heavily on whatscenarios are regarded as likely in the firstplace. Ultimately, monetary policy makerscannot get around judging some scenarios aspossible and others as not possible – ie evenrobust control requires a certain probabilityassessment, albeit a rough one.
In addition, a monetary policy conducted ac-
cording to the robust control principle cancreate moral hazard as this approach impliesthat market participants are insured againstworst-case scenarios by the central bank atvirtually no cost. In other words, business andfinancial market players assume that thecosts of their risk taking will be borne by allbut that they alone will reap the benefits oftheir actions. This may encourage them totake risks in excess of macroeconomically effi-cient levels.
For the reasons mentioned above, such dis-
cretionary intervention as that envisaged bythe robust control approach should not comeinto general usage but should instead be re-stricted to potential crisis situations. Other-wise, monetary policy itself would be in
danger of becoming a source of uncertainty.
Uncertainty and the Eurosystem’s
monetary policy strategy
To reduce economic agents’ uncertainty
about the central bank’s behaviour as muchas possible, the monetary policy decision-making process should be rendered as trans-parent as possible. A clear definition of the ul-timate objective, now standard practice inmany countries, plays a major role in this re-spect. In that vein, the Governing Council ofthe ECB, in early 2003, clarified its previousdefinition of price stability.

is also – and maybe particularly – the case re-garding the Eurosystem’s monetary policystrategy. However, the complexity of such astrategy means that communications policymust be to a high standard.
The Eurosystem is rising to this challenge by
publishing and commenting on the data rele-vant to its decisions as well as by extensivelyand coherently laying out the reasons for its
monetary policy decisions. The structuring ofthe relevant information into a monetary an-alysis and an economic analysis has proven tobe a big help in this regard. The monetary an-alysis focuses on the long-term monetary na-ture of inflation. The economic analysis, bycontrast, examines real and financial indica-tors that are of importance for assessing theshort to medium-term price outlook.

29Purchasing power
parity theory as a
concept for evaluating
price competitivenessSince the start of monetary union, the
euro’s exchange rate has been subjectto sharp fluctuations. Although thesingle currency lost considerableground against most currencies in 1999and 2000 in particular, a strong coun-termovement followed. As a weightedaverage against the currencies of theeuro area’s most important tradingpartners, at the beginning of 2004 theeuro – at times – was trading above itsdebut level of early 1999.
Against the background of fairly mod-
erate export growth up to the middleof 2003, the euro’s strength hasprompted questions about the impacton Germany’s price competitiveness.However, the relevant competition in-dicators show that the price competi-tiveness of German producers remainswithin limits which are fully in linewith long-term empirical values. Thisevaluation is ultimately based on thetheoretical concept of purchasingpower parity in its “relative” construct.This article explains this and, at thesame time, sets it in a broader perspec-tive by also presenting indicators ofstricter, absolute purchasing powerparity. These largely confirm the previ-ous assessments of Germany’s competi-tive position.

30The exchange rate of the euro and
Germany’s price competitiveness
In the past two years, the euro has appreci-
ated strongly against most currencies. It wentup by almost 20% as a weighted averageagainst the currencies of the euro area’s12 most important trading partners betweenthe first quarter of 2002 and the first quarterof 2004. This was due mainly to considerablegains against the US dollar. Viewed in isol-ation, the euro’s appreciation involved a lossof price competitiveness for the Germaneconomy. In this respect, the view was oftenexpressed that the exchange rate paritieswere inappropriate and no longer in a stateof equilibrium.
However, this can be countered with the
argument that the euro had depreciated atalmost the same rate in the years precedingits appreciation. In this sense, the recentappreciation merely constituted a correction.Moreover, an economy’s competitiveness isalso influenced by factors other than the ex-change rate, in particular, by price develop-ments in the countries in question.
One indicator of price competitiveness which
combines exchange rate and price move-ments is the real exchange rate (see also theadjacent box). In contrast to the nominal ex-change rate, which reflects the relative priceof two currencies, the real exchange rate rep-resents the relative price between a domesticbasket of goods and a foreign basket ofgoods. A real currency appreciation usuallyequates to a deterioration in the price com-petitiveness of the domestic economy. ThisPurchasing power parity theory and
real exchange rate
The absolute purchasing power parity theory suggests
that, in the long run,
P = P*/W, (1)
whereby Pdenotes the price of a given basket of goods
in the domestic country and P*denotes the correspond-
ing price abroad; Wis the nominal exchange rate be-
tween the domestic country and the foreign country,expressed as the price of the domestic currency in unitsof the foreign currency, as is usually the case for euroexchange rates for example. A nominal appreciation ofthe domestic currency is therefore reflected by a riseinW.
The relative purchasing power parity theory, however, is
characterised by the long-run validity of
P=c (P*/W )( 2 )
whereby crepresents a constant. If growth rates are
flagged with a “^”, (2) results in
^W=^P*–^P. (3)
According to (2), the purchasing power ratio between
the domestic country and the foreign country is con-stant if the relative purchasing power parity theoryholds. According to (3), the rate of change in the nom-inal exchange rate is equal to the inflation differential.
If the countries in question are members of a monetary
union, the nominal exchange rate is permanently fixedatW= 1. In such cases, the absolute purchasing power
parity theory implies that domestic and foreign pricelevels should be identical in the long run, P=P * accord-
ing to (1), and the relative purchasing power paritytheory suggests that the inflation differentials accord-ing to (3) cancel out in the long run,
^P* =^P.
In the majority of cases, the real exchange rate Ris used
as an indicator of an economy’s price competitiveness.This may be defined as
R=W (P/P*)( 4 )
Equation (4) shows that the concept of a real exchange
rate may also be applied to countries within a monetaryunion, where it is defined as the price ratio between thedomestic country and the foreign country ( R = P/P* ).
1
Equations (1), (2) and (4) show that absolute purchasing
power parity is achieved if the real exchange rate is R=
1o rI n (R)= 0 and that relative purchasing power parity
is achieved if R=c or In (R)=I n(c). Since the purchasing
power parity theory is a long-run concept, it only ap-plies if ln (R)is stationary (relative version) or if ln (R)is
stationary at 0 (absolute version).
1The indicator of the price competitiveness of the Ger-
man economy is essentially no more than a trade-weighted real exchange rate whereby the weights ofindividual trading partners correspond to their signi-ficance in German foreign trade.

31occurs if the domestic currency appreciates in
nominal terms even though the domestic andforeign inflation rates are the same or if do-mestic prices rise more sharply than foreignones despite a constant exchange rate.
A useful indicator of Germany’s price com-
petitiveness can be ascertained, for instance,by using appropriate price or cost indices toillustrate price developments in the countriesin question. In this respect, the Bundesbankgenerally uses the deflators of total sales asdefined in the national accounts. These coverthe spectrum of goods more comprehensivelythan, for example, consumer prices. To obtaina representative picture of German foreigntrade in regional terms, the indicator is calcu-lated as a weighted average against 19 ofGermany’s major trading partners. Whenconsidering the developments in this indica-
tor of Germany’s price competitiveness it be-comes clear that, although the indicatortends to reflect developments in the effective(nominal) exchange rate of the euro, it is itselfsomewhat more subdued by comparison. Forexample, it indicated that Germany’s com-petitiveness deteriorated by only 5

tween the first quarter of 2002 and the firstquarter of 2004. This contrasts with an im-provement in Germany’s competitiveness ofaround 10% from the first quarter of 1999 tothe fourth quarter of 2000.

32ations on Germany’s competitiveness in no
small measure.
Although these considerations put the influ-
ence of the euro’s exchange rate on Germa-ny’s competitiveness into perspective, they donot yet allow an opinion to be formed aboutthe appropriateness of exchange rate parities.In order to be able to assess the extent towhich a change in price competitiveness alsoappears economically justified, a sound refer-ence value for the indicator of price competi-tiveness is needed. The following section willexamine the extent to which purchasingpower parity theory enables such referencevalues to be calculated and how Germany’sprice competitiveness is to be assessed in thiscontext.
Purchasing power parity theory as
a theoretical concept
There are two versions of purchasing power
parity theory – an absolute and a relative one.Absolute purchasing power parity theorystates that a basket of goods costs the samedomestically and abroad if the goods pricesare converted into a common currency. Inother words, absolute purchasing power par-ity theory postulates that the purchasingpower of money is equal between countries.By contrast, relative purchasing power paritytheory does not compare domestic and for-eign levels of purchasing power, but ratherfocuses on changes in this purchasing power.Relative purchasing power parity theorytherefore states that the inflation rate differ-entials between two countries or regions areoffset through inverse changes in the nominal
exchange rate so that the purchasing powerratio between the two remains constant. Ittherefore follows that the validity of absolutepurchasing power parity theory implies thevalidity of relative purchasing power paritytheory, but not vice versa.
Purchasing power parity theory is based on
the law of one price. According to this law, asingle homogeneous good should have thesame price everywhere – excluding any trans-portation costs – under conditions of perfectcompetition if the relevant national prices areexpressed in a common currency. If this lawholds true for all goods prices then, under cer-tain conditions, purchasing power parity the-ory applies in both its absolute and its relativeform. One mechanism which, in theory, up-holds the law of one price and thus purchasingpower parity theory is goods arbitrage, whichhas a tendency to even out geographical pricedifferences. Trade barriers (eg transportationcosts or varying import duties) as well as differ-ent indirect tax rates may prevent total priceequalisation, but would be compatible with anappropriately modified form of absolute pur-chasing power parity theory or at least withthe relative version.
However, the described price equalisation ef-
fects can be expected only in the long termaccording to both versions of the purchasingpower parity theory. In the shorter term, theinfluence of international goods arbitrage iseclipsed by other factors.

33is considered to be neutral if the domestic
price level is equal to the foreign price level.In the case of the relative purchasing powerparity theory, the average level of the real ex-change rate should, over time, provide a use-ful benchmark for a balanced competitiveposition provided that the observation periodis sufficiently long and there are no indica-tions of structural shifts in the equilibriumprice relationships.
Indicators of Germany’s price
competitiveness compared with theirlong-term average
If – in keeping with these considerations –
the long-term average is taken as an under-lying benchmark, then an assessment of thecurrent competitive position of Germany’seconomy is primarily dependent on three de-terminants. These are the period over whichthe long-term average is calculated, the priceor cost index used to calculate the indicatorand the group of countries against which thelevel of competitiveness is to be gauged. First-ly, by way of a benchmark, the aforemen-tioned indicator of Germany’s price competi-tiveness based on the deflators of total sales– which is calculated against 19 major tradingpartners – is to be compared with its averageascertained as of 1975. This shows that, inthe first quarter of 2004, the German econ-omy still had a slight competitive advantageover its trading partners despite the notice-able deterioration in its price competitivenessin the past two years (see the chart onpage 34).An evaluation of this kind is generally con-
firmed if other periods are used to calculatethe average. Owing to the regime shift fromfixed to more flexible exchange rate arrange-ments and the turmoil accompanying thischange, it would be inappropriate to extendthe observation period to include the yearsprior to 1975. Moreover, an average calcu-lated in this way would tend to result in aneven more favourable assessment of Ger-many’s current competitive situation. A short-er observation period would be possible, inprinciple. However, as purchasing power par-ity theory is a long-term concept, overly shortobservation periods are not really economic-ally justified for calculating the average. If theaverage values calculated over all possible ob-servation periods from the period 1975 to2004 to the period 1990 to 2004 are plottedon a chart as a straight line, the result isa band of average values (see chart onpage 34). The mean over the period startingin 1975 with a comparatively high referencevalue is at the lower edge of the band on thechart. Thus, according to this reference value,Germany’s current competitiveness is judgedto be comparatively positive owing to the un-favourable price and exchange rate pattern inthe second half of the 1970s. However, theband is fairly narrow. If averages are calcu-lated over other periods, therefore, the con-clusion reached on the competitiveness of theGerman economy is quite similar. Even if themost unfavourable mean for Germany’s com-petitiveness is used as a basis, the assessmentis still valid and indicates that the Germaneconomy retained a slight competitive edgeup to the end of the observation period.

35The price or cost index chosen to calculate
the indicator can also affect the assessmentof competitiveness. The deflator of total saleshas the advantage of covering price develop-ments in all of the goods in demand in aneconomy as broadly as possible.
1Similar indi-
cators can also be calculated, for example, onthe basis of consumer prices or unit labourcosts in the enterprise sector. However, itemerges that the different calculationmethods have only a very minor effect on thecompetitiveness of the German economy (seechart on page 34). The indicators based onconsumer prices and unit labour costs in theenterprise sector form very similar curves tothe indicator based on the deflators of totalsales, which is also reflected in the relevantcorrelation coefficients (0.93 and 0.95). Thereis also only a very small difference in theirlevel compared with the relevant long-termaverage. Correspondingly, these two indica-tors also confirm the conclusion describedearlier, namely that Germany’s competitive-ness is currently to be evaluated as beingneutral or somewhat more favourable thanthat of its trading partners.
2
Finally, it should be examined whether the in-dicators dealt with up to now – which con-sider Germany’s competitiveness “only” incomparison with 19 trading partners – aresufficiently broadly based in their definition offoreign countries. To settle this question, it ispossible to resort to an indicator of the Ger-man economy’s price competitiveness whichincludes another 30 trading partners. Thedata required to calculate an indicator of thiskind are available only for the past ten years,which means that it is not possible to workout a real long-term average. However, the
very high correlation between this indicatorand a comparable indicator calculated against19 countries (correlation coefficient of 0.99)suggests that limiting the calculation to a nar-rower group – which nonetheless accountsfor 71% of total German foreign trade – doesnot lead to any bias, at least for the recentpast.
In conclusion, it can be stated that Germany’s
price competitiveness in the winter of 2003-04 can be assessed as having been neutral orslightly positive in comparison with long-termaverages. This finding applies irrespective ofthe calculation method used. It does notchange if the time period on which the calcu-lation of the long-term average is based isaltered, nor if other price or cost indices are

Bulletin , August 2003, pp 67-74.
2Only an indicator of Germany’s competitiveness calcu-
lated on the basis of unit labour costs in manufacturing
suggests a different evaluation. According to this assess-
ment, the current competitiveness of the German econ-
omy is considerably more unfavourable. Furthermore,
this indicator is only slightly correlated with the standard
indicator based on the deflators of total sales (correlation
coefficient of 0.28). However, it has already been stressed
previously that this indicator in particular is unsuitable for
evaluating Germany’s competitive situation as the labour
costs in manufacturing account for a much smaller share
of total output than the input from other sectors and
from abroad. The labour costs in other sectors, which are
reflected in the input prices, have developed rather fa-
vourably in Germany by international comparison, which
means that failure to consider this component would
lead to an overly unfavourable assessment of Germany’s
competitiveness. See Deutsche Bundesbank, The indica-

36used, nor if a broader group of countries is
considered.
This robustness in the assessment of current
competitiveness in relation to the calculationmethods is not a feature particular to Ger-many, but is also reflected in a correspondingindicator of the euro area’s price competitive-ness (ie the euro’s real exchange rate).
3How-
ever, the current competitiveness of thewhole euro area is – according to these calcu-lations – consistently more unfavourable thanGermany’s situation. This is due mainly to thefact that, since the beginning of monetaryunion, the German economy has been stead-ily becoming more competitive in comparisonwith its euro-area trading partners owing tothe comparatively low level of domestic priceincreases (see chart on page 34).
Indicators of Germany’s price
competitiveness based on the absolutepurchasing power parity theory
The indicators of price competitiveness de-
scribed up to now do not allow any conclu-sions to be drawn about a country’s competi-tiveness in accordance with absolute purchas-ing power parity theory. This is because priceor cost indices, which ultimately do not allowany insight into the appropriate relative priceand cost levels, were used to calculate theseindicators. An evaluation of competitivenessbased on the absolute purchasing power par-ity theory, however, calls for appropriate levelcomparisons. This can be achieved, for ex-ample, with the help of the relative pricelevels for a given basket of goods at homeand abroad, which can be expressed in a
common currency using the relevant (nomin-al) exchange rate.
The relative price levels for the very broad
baskets of goods – which are geared to grossdomestic product (GDP) – of the OECD mem-bers and other European countries are pro-vided by the OECD-Eurostat “PurchasingPower Parity Programme.” The World Bank,for example, makes available data for a largergroup of countries based on the findings ofthe “International Comparison Programme”.In recording prices, these projects considerboth the representativeness and the inter-national comparability of the goods andservices.
It may at first not seem particularly suitable to
use such broad baskets of goods for compari-sons of price competitiveness as it can beassumed that a relatively high percentage of– in particular – the services in these basketsof goods are not traded internationally andare thus not directly exposed to internationalcompetition. However, as in the case of usingdeflators of total sales, an argument in favourof broad baskets of goods is that goodswhich are not traded internationally are em-ployed in the production of tradable goodsand that the corresponding relative pricelevels thus reflect fairly well the generaldomestic cost pressures to which enterprisesare exposed.

37Based on these data, it is also possible to cal-
culate an indicator of the German economy’sprice competitiveness as a weighted averageagainst 19 of Germany’s major trading part-ners. Two such indicators – one calculatedusing data from Eurostat and the other usingdata from the World Bank – are shown in theadjacent chart. At a value of 100, the pricesin Germany are, on average, equal to thoseabroad; at higher values, the price level inGermany is above that of its trading partners.The most recent values are estimated.
The developments in both indicators are
largely in parallel with one another and withthe indicator based on the deflators of totalsales described above. The correlation coeffi-cients are between 0.96 and 0.996. There-fore, these three indicators reflect changes inprice competitiveness in a very similar way.However, they differ somewhat in their as-sessment of Germany’s competitive position.Evidently the level of prices in Germany wasusually slightly higher than that of the coun-try’s main trading partners – not least owingto the advanced degree of development andthus prosperity – in the last 30 years.
4This
has changed recently, however, as a result ofthe catching-up process, which a number ofpartner countries have successfully completedin recent decades, and the price increaseswhich this has involved. For example, for2000, both baskets of goods show a pricelevel for Germany which is 5% to 6% lowerthan the average.

38since that time, above all as a result of the
euro’s appreciation. However, it may be as-sumed that, even in the first quarter of 2004,the price level in Germany, on average, eithercorresponded to that of its trading partnersor, at most, was marginally higher dependingon the basket of goods used.
The composition of the basket of goods has
quite a big effect on the findings with regardto relative competitiveness. A basket ofgoods which gives a fair reflection of domes-tic consumption habits but not foreign con-sumption habits will tend to show a lower do-mestic price level and thus overestimate anydomestic competitive advantages. In order toeliminate such bias, the Eurostat price dataused here are for a basket of goods which istypical – at least to a similar extent – for all ofthe countries examined.
5It is possible to get
an idea of the robustness of the findings withregard to the choice of basket by comparingthe relative price level calculated using theEurostat data with the relative price level cal-culated using the Federal Statistical Office’sprice data which are, however, based on theGerman basket of goods owing to a differentobjective.
6At the beginning of 2004, the
price of the German basket of goods calcu-lated in this way was one-eighth lower thanon a weighted average against the 19 tradingpartners considered. This shows that, evenwhen absolute purchasing power parity isused to assess competitiveness, allowancesmust be made for a margin of uncertainty.The academic debate on the validity
of the purchasing power parity theory
Over the last one and a half decades, much academic
research has examined the empirical validity of the pur-chasing power parity theory.
1As mentioned at the
beginning of this article, this theory implies that thereal exchange rate is stationary, ie it shows neither a de-terministic nor a stochastic trend over time. The station-arity of a time series can be analysed using unit roottests. If such tests are performed on individual timeseries of real exchange rates, which, for such analyses,are generally calculated on the basis of price indices, inmost cases stationarity is rejected for the period afterthe collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Given this re-sult, the validity of the purchasing power parity theoryin its simple and unmodified form cannot be confirmed,at least not from an empirical point of view.
These analyses were increasingly criticised, however, on
the grounds that, owing to a possibly very slow adjust-ment process of the real exchange rate to its long-runaverage, the specified examination period is too shortto statistically determine whether this variable is trend-bearing or not. This problem can be solved in one oftwo ways. In some studies, the observation period isextended considerably, with some time series of realexchange rates stretching back for over a century.
Another possible way to get round the problem of very
short time series is to test several series of real exchangerates simultaneously in one panel for stationarity there-by combining all the information contained. Suchanalyses often come to the opposite conclusion, ie thatthe stationarity of real exchange rates over the last30 years cannot be rejected. In essence, this result sup-ports the validity of at least the relative purchasingpower parity theory. Nevertheless, the speed of adjust-ment to the long-run average derived from theseanalyses is often so slow (half lives of deviations ofthree to five years are entirely normal) that it is nolonger considered plausible.

39Is the real exchange rate stationary?
Results of a study using disaggregated price data
The box “Purchasing power parity theory and real ex-
change rate” on page 30 shows that the relative purchas-
ing power parity theory is fulfilled if the (logarithmic) real
exchange rate is stationary. Alongside the Balassa-Samuel-
son hypothesis, another reason is occasionally suggested as
to why this may not be the case,1namely that if there are
differences in the production structures or consumption
habits of the countries in question, there will be discrepan-
cies in the weight distribution of the national baskets of
goods. In such cases, shifts in the price structure vary in
their overall impact on price indices. For example, rising oil
prices have more of an effect on the consumer price indices
of those countries that consume relatively large amounts
of oil. If such changes in price structure, which may also be
brought about by technical progress, for example, are of a
permanent nature, it must be assumed that the real ex-
change rate is not stationary. This would apply even if the
law of one price is upheld on a permanent basis.
The argument is formalised below based on the definition
of the real exchange rate2,
rit/C17sit/C0pitþpjt (1)
whereby sitdenotes the nominal exchange rate between
country iand country j(expressed as the price of the cur-
rency of country jin currency units of country i), at time t
and pit(pjt) is the price index of country i(j). Lower-case let-
ters denote the logarithmic values. If in equation (1) one
uses
pit/C17Pm
k¼0/C11ikpikt¼pi0tþPm
k¼1/C11ik/C0
pikt/C0pi0t/C1
(2)
as the definition of a price index andr
i0t/C17sit/C0pi0tþpj0t (3)
as the definition of the real exchange ratio of any particu-
lar good k= 0 between the two countries, the result is
rit¼ri0tþPm
k¼1/C2
/C11jk/C0
pjkt/C0pj0t/C1
/C0/C11ik/C0
pikt/C0pi0t/C1/C3
. (4)
In these equations, for example, piktdenotes the price of
good kin country iat time t, and aikstands for the weight
of good kin the basket of goods of country i. According to
equation (4), the real exchange rate ritcomprises two com-
ponents, namely the real exchange ratio of good 0 and a
weighted sum. The expression in the round brackets shows
the relative price between good kand good 0 in country j
and country i, respectively. A permanent shift in the price
structure should result in the non-stationarity of these
bracketed terms. If the weights in both countries, aikand
ajk, are not identical, the expression in the square bracketswill likewise not be stationary in the event of an identical
relative price change in the domestic and foreign country.
Furthermore, if there are no cointegration relationships,
this will also mean that non-stationarity cannot be rejected
for the real exchange rate.
Price indices of sectors, rather than the prices of individual
goods, are used to analyse the time series characteristics
of individual terms. The time series of price indices for
18 economic sectors are available for eleven OECD coun-
tries (including the USA, Japan, Germany and the United
Kingdom) starting from 1977 up to 1999, providing
not only country data panels but also sector panels for in-
dividual countries. Various panel unit root tests are per-
formed.
The test results indicate that the second-term sum in equa-
tion (4) indeed largely consists of non-stationary compon-
ents. This applies both to the relative prices in the round
brackets and to the expressions in the square brackets as a
whole. From this, it can be concluded that there have been
permanent relative price shifts between the sectors in the
economies analysed. The effects of these on the real ex-
change rate can also not be eliminated owing to the differ-
ent weight distribution in the various countries. According-
ly, the second-term sum as a whole turns out to be regu-
larly non-stationary.
If the same panel unit root tests, however, are applied
to the real exchange rate rit, the results point conversely
to stationarity and thus confirm the results of other
studies. However, since cointegration between the first
and second components of the real exchange rate in equa-
tion (4), ie between ri0tand the second-term sum, cannot
be assumed – if only because ri0toften appears to be
stationary3– the results are often clearly at variance with
each other. There are two hypotheses that could resolve
this conflict. Firstly, the variance (of the differences over
time) of the second component in comparison to the first is
relatively small. It could be, for example, that the non-
stationarity of the real exchange rate is masked by a relative-
ly large, potentially stationary first component. Secondly,
the test result, which indicates that the real exchange rates
are stationary, could be based on a bias. This is because re-
sults from unit root tests are always biased in favour of the
rejection of non-stationarity if the time series that is being
analysed comprises two components, one of which is sta-
tionary and the other non-stationary. The results of the
study indeed suggest that the real exchange rate consists
of two such components.4Both hypotheses suggest that,
contrary to largely established opinion, real exchange rates
are not stationary and that, from this point of view, the
purchasing power parity theory also does not hold.

40Competition indicators based on relative
price levels can also be divided up into indica-tors against individual groups of countries.The chart on page 37 shows the develop-ments in such indicators of Germany’s com-petitiveness compared with the other euro-area countries on the one hand and furthermajor trading partners on the other. It revealsthat the level of prices in Germany has alwaysbeen relatively high, especially in comparisonwith the country’s euro-area trading partners.In recent years, however, a trend towardsconvergence of the price levels is evident. Bycontrast, the price level in Germany has beenlower than that of its non-euro-area tradingpartners in the past few years. However, thecompetitive edge which Germany gainedowing to the weakness of the euro in 1999and 2000 has now diminished again.
The Balassa-Samuelson effect and
Germany’s competitiveness
There have been various attempts in the past
to empirically test the purchasing power par-ity theory. These have produced different re-sults depending on the methodology applied(see boxes on pages 38 and 39). The Balassa-Samuelson effect is one possible reason whythe theory is comparatively difficult to prove.According to this hypothesis, the purchasingpower parity theory applies only to somegoods, namely to internationally tradableones. If the productivity level in a country’stradables sector increases, according to theBalassa-Samuelson hypothesis the prices ofthese goods will not fall as they are deter-mined by the conditions of competition onthe world market. Instead, this productivity
growth will lead to wage increases in this sec-tor. However, the non-tradables sector willthen fear a migration of its labour force tothe tradables sector and, thus, there will alsobe wage increases in this sector. This will leadto price increases in non-tradable goods,which will ultimately raise the average pricelevel in the whole economy.
7
Within the framework of this model, it is usu-ally assumed that productivity gains accruemainly in the tradables sector. This impliesthat countries which have already achievedhigh levels of productivity will also have com-paratively high price levels. This hypothesiscan be confirmed by comparing the averageprice levels of countries with substantiallydifferent per capita GDP . Above all services– which are mostly equated with internation-ally non-tradable goods – are very reasonablypriced in countries with low per capitaincome.
The question now arises as to whether the
Balassa-Samuelson effect can also be demon-strated for the group of countries comprisingGermany and its trading partners (ie countrieswhose per capita income is comparativelysimilar) and to what extent this effect altersthe assessment of Germany’s competitive-ness. In order to analyse this question, thereal exchange rate calculated on the basis of

Each point on this chart represents a givencountry and indicates the ratio in 2003 ofthat country’s relative price level comparedwith Germany’s level to the country’s percapita GDP . In 2003, countries whose dot is inthe upper part of the chart were more “ex-pensive” and had a higher per capita GDP thefurther their dot is to the right. The regressionline marked on the chart shows the estimatedrelationship between the two variables.
According to this estimation, if the per capita
GDP of a country is 10% higher, then its rela-tive price level is 3.6% higher. The standarddeviation indicated suggests that this result is
statistically significant. The Balassa-Samuel-son effect can therefore be confirmed in thiscase. Moreover, the results support the earlierassessments of competitiveness: in 2003,Germany’s price competitiveness corres-ponded approximately to the level whichwould have been expected on the strength ofGermany’s per capita income.
Similarly, these connections can also be exam-
ined for other time periods and with alterna-tive productivity variables, for example, GDPper person employed. In doing so, however, itbecomes apparent that, in many cases, it isPrice competitiveness 1

the real exchange rate and productivity.9Indi-
cators based on the Balassa-Samuelson hy-pothesis are, therefore, not generally prefer-able to the other indicators described here.However, all of the productivity variables usedproduced the same result, namely that Ger-many’s price competitiveness is to be classifieda tl e a s ta sn e u t r a la tt h ec u r r e n te n d .
The analysis can also be extended from a
purely cross-sectional view to take accountof the time dimension. Although the realexchange rate and the measure of product-ivity used turn out to be integrated andco-integrated if panel integration and co-integration tests are applied – which, in prin-ciple, suggests a Balassa-Samuelson effect –,three different panel estimation methods pro-vide quite disparate estimates of the suggest-ed connection. In this sense, the inclusion ofthe time dimension likewise does not providea robust confirmation of the Balassa-Samuel-son hypothesis for this group of countriesalthough the results are often significant.Conclusion
In view of the relatively major uncertainties
regarding the assessment of an economy’sprice competitiveness, it is advisable to basean evaluation on several indicators. The pur-chasing power parity theory provides aframework from which different indicatorscan be derived. Although various measureswere used here, they largely come to thesame conclusion for Germany, namely thatGermany’s price competitiveness in 2003 andthe first quarter of 2004 is, by and large, to beclassified as neutral – or somewhat better – inspite of the euro’s strength.
9Furthermore, this result corresponds to the outcome of
earlier analyses carried out by the Bundesbank in which
no evidence was found to suggest that the Balassa-
Samuelson effect had a significant influence on move-
ments in the real external value of the Deutsche Mark.

43Overall financial flows
in 2003Like 2002, last year was also marked by
a pronounced weakness in investment.In the aggregate financial balancesthis was most clearly seen in the factthat the corporate sector, a “classical”deficit sector, again achieved a positivenet lending/net borrowing position.This development was linked to an in-crease in the internal financing ratioand to a reduction in the corporatedebt ratio; this ratio rose fairly sharplyin the period from 1998 to 2001.Owing to the improved capital struc-tures and the still low interest ratelevel, important financial conditionsare in place for more buoyant invest-ment in the cyclical recovery process.Households again increased their trad-itional net lending during the periodunder review. In addition, the higherrate of saving helped to ensure thatthe stock of nominal financial assets,which in 2002 had declined for the firsttime since 1949, grew strongly again in2003. This contrasted with a public sec-tor deficit, which reached a new peakin 2003. Another point is that a sub-stantial part of domestic savingsflowed abroad. This article provides adetailed account of these develop-ments in aggregate income and in theflow of funds within the economy as awhole and sets the findings in an inter-national context.

44Aggregate investment
Investment in Germany in 2003 remained at
the same low level as in 2002. The net invest-ment ratio after deduction of depreciationagain amounted to only 3
1/C252% of national dis-
posable income. This means that in the pastthree years fixed capital formation averagedno more than just over 370 billion, or 4% of
disposable income, compared with ratios ofbetween 8% and 12% in the period from1991 to 2000. While these figures were sig-nificantly affected by German reunificationand the global stock exchange boom, there isno doubt that there was a pronounced weak-ness in investment during the past few years.
The picture is particularly clear in the case of
producing enterprises, whose expenditure onplant and equipment, taken together, de-clined for the third time in succession. Theirnet investment during each of the past threeyears was just under two-thirds below thecomparable levels at the beginning and endof the 1990s. Enterprises relinquished thelead in investment to households some timeago. In 2003 non-financial corporations
1
accounted for just over one-third of total realinvestment.
Even though there has been an increase in
the percentage of households, their invest-ment, like that of enterprises, has steadily de-clined during the past few years. In the periodunder review real investment was just overtwo-fifths lower than in 1999 when house-building, in particular, was still very brisk.Construction work has slowed down substan-tially since then. This development was re-inforced by the downturn in sole proprietors’
investment in machinery and equipment. Inaccordance with ESA 95, sole proprietorsbelong to the household sector.
In the context of the economy as a whole,
general government has been playing only aminor role as an investor since as far back asthe mid-1990s. Expenditure by general gov-ernment on the public capital stock fell from346 billion in 1994 to 331 billion at the end
of the period under review. Up to 2002 theseamounts were enough to compensate for theconsumption of assets shown in the statistics.Last year, depreciation actually exceeded the(gross) amount spent on investment, whichmeant that a disinvestment of just over 33 bil-
lion was recorded for the public sector.
Domestic saving
In contrast to investment – and to house-
holds’ saving, which increased – the aggre-gate net saving of all domestic sectors actual-ly fell year on year in 2003. At 3115 billion, it
was just over 310 billion lower than a year
earlier. The national saving ratio, at 6
1/C252%o f
disposable income, was the second-lowestratio since 1991. This decline is attributableprimarily to general government. For manyyears now government revenue has beenlower than the ongoing expenditure by gov-ernment in areas other than investment. In2003 this differential, including the net cap-ital transfers to the other sectors, amountedto -387 billion, which was the largest deficit

46since reunification. A major part of this was
due to the unfavourable tax situation and ris-ing social security spending, developmentswhich were partly attributable to the cyclicalweakness. The poor profitability of the banksand insurance corporations also had a nega-tive impact. The retained profits of theproducing enterprises, at 39 billion, were like-
wise lower in 2003 than in the previous year.By contrast, households again increased theirsavings, which rose this time to almost 3170
billion if capital transfers are included.
Aggregate and sectoral net
lending/net borrowing
Since general government, as mentioned
above, did not even invest as much as thearithmetical level of asset consumption in2003, the financial gap was somewhat lessunfavourable than (negative) saving. Never-theless, at just over 380 billion, or 4
1/C252%o f
national disposable income, the financial gapreached a new record level. The opposite de-velopment in the private sector is striking.Owing to their sharply curtailed investment,the non-financial corporations, for example,ended the year, as in 2002, with a smallfinancial surplus. However, the householdsector remained the largest source of funds.This sector again increased its provision offunds to 3125
1/C252billion, or 7% of disposable
income. Consequently, its net lending was farabove the average of the 1990s. All sectorsin surplus provided funds amounting to3135 billion in 2003. Government absorbed
two-thirds of this. Just under 355 billion
flowed into the foreign financial markets.Germany has not always been a creditor to
other countries. Owing to reunification, for-eign funds were required to finance domesticinvestment. It is only since 2001 that the cur-rent account is in the black again, as was cus-tomary prior to 1990. By contrast, Italy, whichis competitively weak, has been dependenton capital imports since 2002. Within theEU-15 countries this has applied to Spain andthe United Kingdom for quite some time, al-beit for other reasons. Last year the aggre-gate financial deficit in each of these twocountries amounted to about 2% of grossdomestic product (GDP). The economic areaof the EU 15 recorded a total surplus of justunder 1% of the aggregate economic out-put. This helped to cover the United States’large capital shortfall, which in the past fewyears has been due to the government’srapidly rising need for credit. Japan, whoseaggregate financial balance in 2003 amount-ed to 3% of GDP , provides a certain counter-position to this.
Important information on the “origin” and
“nature” of national balances is provided bythe sectoral analysis. Whereas in most coun-tries last year households acted as lenders toother sectors, this was not the case in theAnglo-Saxon countries, where saving ratiosare relatively low. The public sector mostlyshowed a financial gap. In the case of enter-prises the picture was very mixed. In 2003only France, Italy and Spain recorded a nega-tive financing balance, as is “customary” inthe corporate sector. Japan was particularlyconspicuous among the countries with apositive financing balance in the industrialsector. Owing to a significant need for con-

47solidation, the corporate financing balance
was more than twice as large as that ofhouseholds. In terms of a mechanical analysisof the balances, this was also reflected in thelarge Japanese current account surplus.
Basic structure of financial flows
While the national accounts reflect real eco-
nomic activity and the income cycle, thefinancial accounts capture the associatedtransactions in the form of financial assetsand external financing. Three differentphases can be identified since the beginningof the 1990s. During the first half of the1990s the financial flows of the (German)non-financial sectors were moving at a rela-tively high level – averaging 15% of dispos-able income – and, despite sharp cyclicalfluctuations in the economy, showed littlevolatility. This changed in 1998 when finan-cial activity rapidly increased, mainly as a re-sult of rising stock market prices and numer-ous corporate mergers and acquisitions. Atits height in the year 2000 this activity at-tained a level of just over 25% of disposableincome. It therefore lay far above the valuesfor fixed capital formation and saving. Therewas then a sharp negative adjustment in thevolume of financial flows, which was linkedto substantial shifts in net sectoral lendingand borrowing. Last year, however, thisdownward movement did not continue des-pite persistently sluggish growth; instead, theacquisition of financial assets and externalfinancing held up at the previous year’s levelsof 10
1/C252% and 73/C254% of disposable income
respectively.Even so, there was a great deal of activity
within financial asset acquisition and thefinancing of the non-financial sectors lastyear. Whereas investment in longer-termassets was again fairly sluggish, investment atthe short end of the market, notably bank de-posits and security acquisitions, increased sig-nificantly – a process which has been evidentsince 2001. Given an approximately 85%share of total financial asset acquisitions inthe non-financial sectors, short-term invest-ment accounted for an exceptionally largeproportion. On the financing side, by con-trast, it was the longer-term maturities thatpredominated – with a share of approximate-ly three-quarters – in 2003. The demand forfunds was determined mainly by buoyantsales of public bonds whereas, with a netvalue of 32 billion, loans were only of margin-as a percentage of disposable income

48al significance. There were similar develop-
ments at the short end of the market. Bankloans with short maturities were again repaidto a considerable extent whereas sales ofmoney market paper more than doubled. Theoutcome was that in 2003 securitised lendingaccounted for a total of just over two-thirdsof non-financial sector borrowing, a sharewhich had not been witnessed since the be-ginning of the 1990s.
Household investment and
borrowing behaviour
Households continued to increase their rate
of saving last year. The saving ratio rose from10.6% to 10.8% as disposable income in-creased only marginally. Even so, the levelreached was much lower than the level in thefirst half of the 1990s and in the two decadesbefore. The 1 percentage point rise in the sav-ing ratio since 2000 is probably, first and fore-most, a reflection of the greater effort beingmade to provide for old age through privateinsurance schemes and of the increasing un-certainty felt by a broad section of the gen-eral public. As far as savings are concerned,however, Germany is not an exceptional casewithin the euro area. The gross concept isoften applied as it improves the internationalcomparability of saving ratios. Owing to theinclusion of the “earned” amounts of depre-ciation, it is rather better suited to modellingthe internal financing options. According tothis concept, the private saving ratio in Ger-many, as in France, was 16
1/C252% in 2003 and
therefore somewhat above the euro-areaaverage, which rose in the past four years by
1 percentage point to just over 15%.
Disposable investable funds, ie net savings
and net capital transfers received, amountedto just under 3170 billion, or 90% of total
funds, in 2003. Financial asset acquisition isclosely correlated with this. Financial savingremained by far the dominant component ofthe uses to which the funds were put. On thewhole, safe short-term assets were the mostfavoured in 2003. Such resources can bequickly redeployed when investment oppor-tunities improve on the financial markets. Asin the previous year, bank deposits grewstrongly by almost 360 billion. As time depo-
sits, in particular, were liquified, sight depositswere expanded even more extensively, notleast because of the attractive terms offeredby some institutions. The tendency to favoursafe assets can clearly be seen in the purchaseof securities. Bonds, which are subject to onlyminor price fluctuations, were in even greaterdemand, at just over 320 billion, than in the
previous year. According to the informationon hand, the purchase of index-linked invest-ment fund certificates and similar productsoffered by banks accounted for a sizeableshare of this. Shares, by contrast, were sold in2003 on balance. However, the willingness tosell was much weaker than in the previoustwo years. This is undoubtedly due to the up-turn in prices which set in again in March2003. The purchase of mutual fund shares isto be interpreted in much the same way. Thewinners here were bond and real estate fundswhereas equity-based mutual funds wereagain less popular.

49Diverging developments were behind the
purchase of claims on the insurance sector,which includes various types of pensionfunds, in 2003. First, sales of traditional insur-ance products were quite buoyant owing tothe debate on cutting back tax advantagesand the need to increase personal provisionfor old age. Second, the reduction in capitalmarket interest rates clearly left its mark.Lower capital bonuses ultimately resulted infewer claims being purchased in 2003 than inthe previous year. For this reason a very sharpdecline had actually been recorded in 2002.Overall, asset acquisition with insurance cor-porations was about half of what it had beenin 1999. One counterweight to this – albeitonly a small one – was the increase in com-pany pension claims, which were covered bypension provisions. These amounted to noless than 313
1/C252billion in 2003.
While, in the past two years, “classical” insur-
ance products were in great demand, the pri-vate Riester pension failed to live up to initialexpectations. In 2003 the number of con-tracts concluded was actually much lowerthan in the previous period. Consequently,this government-promoted form of oldage provision has so far contributed little tofinancial asset acquisition. By contrast, thebuild-up of company pension claims resultingfrom the regulation applying to direct in-surance plans since 2002 was more success-ful. After a sluggish start in 2002 the con-tracts concluded with pension funds in-creased substantially in 2003 although thefinancial assets lodged there are, admittedly,still small.In contrast to saving and financial asset acqui-
sition, the acquisition of non-financial assetsand the taking up of loans are at a muchlower level. Both items have been decliningfor four years. Households’ retrenchment ininvestment has been widespread. After ex-penditure on plant and equipment it is nowexpenditure on what are known as otherassets, including, for example, purchased andself-made software, which has declined.After deduction of depreciation, fixed capitalformation amounted to a total of hardlymore than 340 billion and therefore about
one-third less than the average in the 1990s.At316 billion net, borrowing in 2003 was still
below the levels in the two previous years,which had been comparatively low anyway.While the demand for mortgage loans ex-panded further on balance, lending for com-as a percentage of disposable income

51mercial and consumption purposes stagnated
for the most part.
Financial assets of households
For the first time since 1949 the nominal
value of households’ financial assets declinedin 2002, but a substantial recovery set in lastyear. In all, the financial assets grew by ap-proximately 3200 billion, or 5%. They now
amount to an average of about 3100,000 per
household. Not only the ongoing financialasset formation but also the strong gains inthe equity markets contributed to the in-crease. This means that households’ financialassets were 2.8 times greater than disposableincome, which was slightly more than theprevious peak in 1999. At the same time, thedebt ratio declined to approximately 110%at the end of the period under review andnet financial assets increased to 170% of dis-posable income.
Last year’s positive evaluation effects were
admittedly too small to bring about signifi-cant structural shifts in households’ port-folios. Another impediment was the net salesof shares. Moreover, the acquisition of mutualfund shares was weaker than in previousyears. Although the ratio of shares held byhouseholds to their financial assets in 2003increased to 6% in terms of value, it was stillwell below the floor reached in the 1990s. Allin all, securities accounted for one-third offinancial assets. The claims on insurance cor-porations and pension funds as well as bankdeposits reached similar proportions. At thebeginning of the 1990s weights were stillquite differently distributed. At that time the
amount of assets held with banks was 10 per-centage points greater than in 2003. Theratios for securities and for claims on the in-surance sector were lower accordingly. Thismeans that there has been a continual shift inthe breakdown of households’ assets overthe past ten years.
Investment and borrowing behaviour
of enterprises
The use of funds by non-financial enterprises
fell for the fourth time in succession in 2003but the rate of the decline was slower. At justover 3240 billion, nominal real and financial
investment taken together were only slightlyabove the record low of 1993. If national dis-posable income were taken as a referencevariable, the 2003 ratio of 13
1/C252% would ac-
tually be about 4 percentage points belowthe 1993 figure. The renewed decline wasdue to various developments. First, total grossinvestment was up on the year as a result ofthe build-up of inventories while expenditureon plant and equipment declined. Second,enterprises’ financial activities almost halvedyear on year. As in 1992, financial investmentaccounted for no more than 15% of the totaluse of funds. In 2000, when financial trans-actions reached their all-time peak, the figurewas 50%.
There were some noteworthy changes in
direction within the field of financial asset ac-quisition. A prime example is the allocation offunds to bank deposits. Whereas in 2002 al-most 310 billion was withdrawn from bankDecline of

53accounts, last year just over 320 billion was
invested, particularly in the form of sight de-posits and time deposits, ie just under 60%of total financial asset formation. Such shiftsin bank deposits had occurred before that, ofcourse. The acquisition of equities fell abrupt-ly. This was almost negligibly small in 2003and therefore weaker than at any time since1991. It was mainly German enterprises thatwere affected here whereas cross-border pur-chases totalled as much as just over 320 bil-
lion. In the case of corporate lending, too,loans to non-residents developed more posi-tively than to the domestic sectors than theyhad done in 2002. Cross-border loansamounted to a total of 33
1/C252billion in 2003.
The normalisation which emerged in financial
asset formation after 2000 also had an im-pact on the financing side. A decline in thedemand for external funds was directly con-nected to this. This in itself would alreadyhave meant a larger proportion of internalfinancing. At the same time, however, theinternal financing options also improved.First, the proceeds arising from depreciationtended to increase, and, second, the retainedprofits of enterprises had a change in sign. In2000 saving showed a deficit of 336 billion
but ran a surplus of 39 billion in 2003. Finally,
there was also an increase to 316 billion in
net capital transfers received. This resulted ina sharp rise in the internal financing ratio. At86% of the total use of funds, a very highvalue was reached. If the pension provisionswere also included, the indicator would actu-ally be at 90%.Almost all external funding channels were
used to a lesser extent last year than in 2002.This applied, in particular, to the commercialdemand for loans from banks and otherbodies. In 2003 bank loans were actuallyrepaid to a large extent on balance, withlonger-term maturities being included herefor the first time since 1991.

55amounted to 322 billion. This is in stark con-
trast to the period prior to 1998 when bankloans had been the main external source offunds. Since 1999 other sources of credithave outstripped transactions with banks. It isthe cross-border transactions with financialsubsidiaries that have made the biggest con-tribution in this respect. A reversal in trendcan also be identified here. Such activitieshave declined rapidly since 2001 and havenow settled down at a level comparable withthat at the beginning of the 1990s. Finally,equity financing has also lost ground. In 2003it was the acquisition of funds through listedand unlisted shares that were most affected.At38 billion, a substantial shortfall was re-
corded for the net issue. Although there werecertainly inflows in return for cash payments,share repurchasing and other operations re-sulted in a transaction-related reduction inthe volume of shares outstanding. The onlyform of financing which expanded signifi-cantly in 2003 was the sale of debt securities.The highest value for some time was reachedat327 billion. It was only in 1993 and 1994
that greater volumes of such paper could beplaced.
Development and structure of
corporate debt
In the period from 1998 to 2001 the external
borrowing by producing enterprises increasedstrongly. Extensive M & A activity and the fair-ly rapid acquisition of non-financial assets,which in 2000 included the purchase ofUMTS licences, played a role here. A certainportion was procured by means of fresh cap-ital; however, recourse to domestic and for-
eign credit and capital markets was evenmore extensive. This development, which wassustained especially by large enterprises, alsoaffected the aggregate balance sheet rela-tionships. For example, the level of debt in-creased by more than 3400 billion between
1998 and 2001; by contrast, borrowing in-creased by only 3250 billion between 1991
and 1997. Accordingly, the debt ratio ofenterprises rose from just over 70% of GDPto just under 90% in 2001. This developmentdid not continue during the past two years,however. In 2003 there was even a slightdecline in the debt ratio to 86%.
In terms of the stock data the most important
source of corporate financing is still domesticbank loans even if these have lost ground inthe past few years. Bank loans accounted forjust under 50% of the total outstanding debtin 2003 compared with almost two-thirds inthe first half of the 1990s. Borrowing fromother lenders, especially non-resident credit-ors, which had grown strongly during thestock market boom, amounted to just underone-quarter during that period. Even so, thatwas four times as high as at the beginning ofthe 1990s. In macroeconomic terms, secur-ities have so far played an almost insignificantrole as a financing tool for enterprises. Evenprovisions for company pension and otherliabilities have played a much greater role.Overall, the financing structure of Germanenterprises has traditionally been predomin-antly long-termist. Maturities of less than ayear accounted for scarcely more than one-third of total borrowing in 2003; short-termdebt outstanding actually accounted for no

56more than just over one-quarter of the more
narrowly defined “market” financial debt,which comprises financial credits and debtsecurities.
One major aspect of debt is the associated
expenditure on interest.
2Here, too, the con-
siderable need for capital between 1998 and2001 has left its mark. Enterprises’ (net)expenditure on interest rose from 18% of theoperating surplus to 21%. Since then, how-ever, the interest payment ratio has goneback down to 18% again. First, this was theresult of consolidation efforts and the weakdemand for fixed capital. Second, the lowercost of borrowing made a substantial contri-bution here. Both factors greatly eased theprofit and loss accounts of German enter-prises during the past two years.A glance at the other large EU economies
shows that there, too, corporate debt rosesharply between 1998 and 2001, in mostcases even more sharply than in Germany.There was an extremely steep increase in theoperating debt ratio in Spain, France and theUnited Kingdom. It was only French and Ital-ian non-financial corporations that achieved acertain stabilisation in the ensuing period. InFrance and Italy the ratio of borrowing toGDP in 2003 more or less persisted at thesame level as in the previous year. This ratioalso showed a further rise in the other coun-tries last year, in Spain by as much as almost10 percentage points. These findings are alsoconfirmed on the basis of “market” financialDebt of non-financial enterprises

57debt, which also provides better international
comparability of the debt ratio. In a cross-section analysis the United Kingdom had byfar the highest ratio at almost 105% of GDPin 2003 and Italy the lowest at just over 60%.There were also significant national differ-ences in the maturity structure of debt.Longer-term financing predominated in Spainand France to much the same extent as inGermany. Italian and, to a slightly lesser ex-tent, British enterprises had considerablygreater recourse to short-term borrowing,which, in these two cases, amounted to asmuch as a half and two-fifths of financialliabilities respectively. Owing to the low inter-est rate level, however, a general decline inshort-termism has been noticeable in thesecountries during the past few years. Generallyspeaking, loans were the predominant formof financial debt. It was only in the UnitedKingdom and France that securities played asignificant role with a share of almost one-quarter.
The debt-equity ratio is often used in addition
to the relationship between debt and GDP .Owing, among other things, to the rise inshare prices during the stock exchange boomof the late 1990s and despite the very highdemand for borrowed funds, this ratio be-tween debt and equity fell to a low of ap-proximately 75% in Germany. Thereafter, theratio rose dramatically to just under 150% bythe end of 2002. This was due primarily tothe sharp fall in share prices and the lowermarket value of enterprises and not to agreater propensity to borrow. In 2003 theratio declined to just over 120% or so follow-ing the recovery of the stock markets. In theother EU countries this indicator followed a
similar path for the most part. However, aninternational comparison of financial leveragemust be interpreted with care because, inaddition to the difficulty of establishing mar-ket values for the capital of unlisted enter-prises, the size structure of businesses andtheir funding habits as well as the sectoralcomposition may distort the picture.
The available data show that German enter-
prises got their balance sheet debt under con-trol again during the past two years and insome cases did so with greater success thanenterprises in other EU countries. This was as-sociated with a substantial reduction in ex-penditure on interest and relief in the profitand loss account. Thus, enterprises also cre-ated more favourable conditions for increas-
