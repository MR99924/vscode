Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 51 Gradual recovery in German economy
German economic output probably grew somewhat more slowly in the second 
quarter than expected.  Real gross domestic product  is likely to have increased ( ) GDP
only slightly in the second quarter of 2024. Temporary hopes that industrial activity 
would soon pick up were distinctly dampened when data for May was published. There 
was a significant fall in industrial production and the signs of stabilisation in new orders 
sparked by April's strong order growth tailed off markedly. The industrial sector is 
therefore likely to have slowed economic activity in the second quarter. Higher 
financing costs continued to weigh on investment and thus on domestic demand for 
industrial goods and construction work. For this reason – as well as due to a counter-
effect following the mild weather in the first quarter – construction output, too, is likely 
to have fallen in the second quarter. By contrast, the recovery in the services sector 
probably continued, as indicated, for example, by survey results from the ifo Institute 
and S&P Global. Private consumption is likely to have buoyed demand for services. 
Overall, available indicators suggest that private consumption increased slightly in the 
second quarter. 
Economic activity is likely to strengthen somewhat in the third quarter.  Private 
consumption will probably pick up a little more momentum. This is likely to be 
supported, in particular, by the favourable framework conditions of strongly rising 
wages, subsiding inflation and a robust labour market Furthermore, in spite of the . 
disappointing June results, pessimism among retailers and service providers declined 
markedly overall in the second quarter according to the  Institute's Business Climate ifo
Index. This is also true for the manufacturing sector. However, the recent dip in 
industrial new orders suggests that the spell of weak demand has not yet been fully 
overcome and that industrial activity is likely to improve only slowly. As things currently 
stand,  growth in the third quarter, too, could therefore fall short of the GDP
expectations expressed in the Bundesbank’s June forecast for Germany.   1)

Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 72 Improvement in industrial activity suffers a setback
Temporary hopes of an end to the weakness in the industrial sector were not 
realised, as industrial output declined sharply in May.  Compared with the previous 
month, industrial output declined sharply in seasonally adjusted terms  and fell back 
to the interim low of December 2023. The level of output averaged across April and 
May was thus also markedly lower than that of the first quarter. This decline was fairly 
broadly based across sectors, with two major exceptions: manufacturers of motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle parts, which expanded their production substantially. 
According to the German Association of the Automotive Industry  this is likely to ( ), VDA
have continued in June. In addition, production in energy-intensive sectors was a bright 
spot. Following a sharp increase at the beginning of the year, it was again slightly 
higher when averaged over April and May than the average for the previous quarter. 
Even so, the level of production in energy-intensive industries remained significantly 
below the levels seen before Russia launched its war of aggression against Ukraine. 2)

provided they can be verified and quantified.

Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 8Signs of stabilisation in industrial demand that emerged in April have weakened, 
but are still in place.  New orders in Germany's industrial sector declined markedly in 
May compared with the previous month. Averaged over April and May, they were 
significantly below the average of the first quarter. Core – i.e. excluding volatile large 
orders – industrial new orders lost hold of the strong growth they had seen in April. 
While significantly more orders from the euro area were the main reason for the strong 
increase in April, the fall-off in May was attributable to considerably fewer orders from 
non-euro-area countries. Thanks to a strong April, industrial new orders excluding 
large orders still rose moderately when averaged over April and May compared with 
the previous quarter. Thus, while the signs of a stabilisation in demand have weakened, 
they are still in place. Survey data paint a similar picture. Despite a dampening of 
business sentiment in June, overall pessimism declined markedly in the second quarter 
compared with the previous quarter. This applies, in particular, to business 
expectations as surveyed by the  Institute, but also to  data on production plans ifo ifo
and export expectations. 


Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 93 Service providers likely to have buoyed economic 
output
The upturn in the services sector is likely to have continued and was probably 
increasingly buoyed by private consumption.  While production data for the services 
sector (excluding trade) are currently only available up to March, they are indicative of 
favourable starting conditions for the second quarter.  Furthermore, the sentiment 
indicators now available for the entire second quarter suggest that service providers 
continued to ramp up their activity. According to surveys conducted by the  Institute, ifo
service providers were markedly more satisfied with their business situation than 
previously. In addition, the corresponding S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index was 
consistently above the expansion threshold. Private consumption is likely to have 
buoyed the expansion of activity by service providers. Real sales in the accommodation 
and food services sector, which are thus far only available up to April, still point to 
rather hesitant consumer behaviour in this sector. However, price and seasonally 
adjusted retail sales in April were significantly higher than the average of the previous 
quarter. The data on private vehicle registrations already available for the entire second 
quarter also indicate a slight increase, thanks to a sharp rise in June. According to 
ifo Institute surveys, retailers, but also enterprises in the accommodation and food 
services sector, assessed their business situation to have improved in the second 
quarter compared to the previous three-month period. This could signal that 
consumers’ precautionary motives are gradually becoming less important and that they 
were already expanding their consumption expenditure somewhat, given rising real 
incomes and a robust labour market. This is also indicated by the GfK consumer climate 
index, which recovered in the second quarter. It shows, for the quarter as a whole, that 
the economic outlook and, in particular, income expectations improved. However, the 
propensity to save declined only slightly, and the propensity to purchase also increased 
only a little. 3) 
3 Even if services production in the second quarter remained constant at the level seen at the end of the first 
quarter, there would again have been a quarter-on-quarter increase, as its level at the end of the first quarter 
exceeded the quarterly average. Production in the services sector thus started the second quarter with a 
statistical carry-over effect.

Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 104 Labour market resilient, but not gaining any ground
The weak economy, combined with strong immigration, currently means that both 
employment and unemployment in Germany are rising slightly.  On the one hand, 
the weak economic stimulus has not yet been sufficient to keep employment in the 
manufacturing and construction sectors – or in temporary agency work – constant. On 
the other hand, employment continues to rise in most services sectors. In particular, 
areas of basic public services such as healthcare and long-term care, education, energy 
and water supply, and also the public sector, recruited noticeably more staff. Across all 
sectors, the number of persons in employment increased by 20,000 in May in 
seasonally adjusted terms. Employment subject to social security contributions also 
rose by this amount averaged over March and April.  On the other hand, the 
proportion of employees subject to social security contributions who are on short-time 
work increased further. In April, 0.7 % of them received short-time working benefits, the 
vast majority of whom were in the manufacturing sector.  4) 
4 These are the most recent data available. March (-4,000 people) and April (+44,000 people) should be 
considered together because of the Easter holidays falling early this year, as the spring rebound in 2024 
probably only started after the Easter holidays at the beginning of April.

Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 11Leading indicators of employment suggest that current developments will continue 
over the next few months.  The ifo Institute's employment barometer remains negative 
for manufacturing and construction, but has recently stabilised. The employment 
barometer of the Institute for Employment Research  for the economy as a whole ()IAB
continues to indicate a slight increase in employment. However, the number of job 
vacancies reported to the Federal Employment Agency is down significantly. In 
particular, the reporting of new vacancies is low.
Unemployment in June rose almost as much as in May.  In seasonally adjusted terms, 
2.78 million persons were registered as unemployed, which was 18,000 more than in 
May. The unemployment rate went up slightly to 6.0 %. Most recently, unemployment 
covered by the statutory unemployment insurance scheme, which is sensitive to cyclical 
conditions, rose in particular. Compared with the previous year, unemployment was up 
by 172,000 people. However, total underemployment, which also includes persons 
engaged in labour market policy measures, rose less sharply as the number of persons 
receiving assistance fell. The ’s unemployment barometer recovered somewhat IAB
after the significant decline in May, but remains below the neutral threshold. This 
suggests a somewhat slower rise in unemployment over the next few months.  


Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 125 Energy commodity prices slightly higher of late
Energy commodity prices have risen slightly of late.  Crude oil prices, in particular, 
have picked up somewhat in recent weeks. As this report went to press, a barrel of 
Brent crude oil cost $88, just over 6 % more than in May. This is likely to have been US
mainly due to new production cutbacks by some  countries and their partners, as OPEC
well as renewed tensions at times in the Middle East. European wholesale natural gas 
prices also increased marginally. Concerns about Russian gas supplies to Europe and 
strong Asian demand for liquefied natural gas propped up prices.

Commentary: Economic conditions
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 136 Inflation rate somewhat lower again in June
At the upstream stages of the economy, the positive price trend for non-energy 
products continued.  For energy, there was a decline in both producer prices in June 
and import prices in May, the last months for which the respective data are available. 
However, for non-energy products sold domestically, producer prices recently rose at a 
similar rate to previous months. This increase was again somewhat sharper than in the 
preceding month. By contrast, price dynamics for imports excluding energy declined 
somewhat. Overall, industrial producer prices were just shy of 2 % below their previous 
year’s level, and import prices were barely below their level of the previous year.
The inflation rate was somewhat lower again in June.  The Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices  rose by only 0.1 % on the month in seasonally adjusted terms, ( ) HICP
after 0.2 % in May. Lower consumer prices for energy once again had a dampening 
effect. By contrast, food prices, especially for unprocessed foods, rose significantly. 
Prices for non-energy industrial goods also edged up slightly once again. By contrast, 
price dynamics for services declined markedly.  Looking at the year-on-year figure, 
headline inflation fell considerably, from 2.8 % in May to 2.5 % in June.  The core rate (
 excluding energy and food) decreased a little less sharply, from 3.5 % to 3.3 %. It HICP
thus remains well above the headline rate.
The inflation rate is likely to fluctuate over the coming months, but is unlikely to 
show any further downward tendencies.  This is partly due to the high volatility in oil 
prices last year, the impact of which is now leading to a base effect in consumer prices. 
Services inflation is likely to come down only slowly over the next few months, given the 
continued strong wage growth. 5) 
 6) 
5 By contrast, prices for accommodation services rose extremely sharply in June, probably due to Germany 
hosting the men's European Football Championship.
6 Annual inflation according to the national consumer price index (CPI) fell from 2.4 % to 2.2 %.

16The global disinflation 
process and its costs

The global disinflation process and its costs
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 17Following the exceptionally strong rise in consumer prices in recent years, the global 
economy appears to be heading towards a “soft landing”. Inflation is on the decline 
worldwide. While double-digit inflation rates were not uncommon in 2022, price 
stability targets have recently come back within reach in many places. Against this 
backdrop, a number of central banks have already started lowering their key interest 
rates again. At the same time, economic activity is broadly robust despite monetary 
policy remaining tight. It has even strengthened somewhat this year. 
Compared with previous episodes of disinflation, this has allowed inflation to be curbed 
fairly quickly and painlessly. This is partly the result of monetary policy tightening. 
Estimates and simulations for the euro area suggest that the rise in interest rates has 
caused inflation to slow down markedly. That said, other factors have also made 
significant contributions to disinflation. Falling commodity prices and subsiding supply-
side disruptions have supported economic activity at the same time. However, severe 
economic slumps have largely been avoided for other reasons, too. Savings and orders 
that were accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic, loose fiscal policy, and 
industrial policy initiatives have boosted demand for goods, services and labour in 
many places. 
However, some of these economically favourable factors are making it difficult to 
achieve inflation targets. Labour markets continue to be tight, wage growth remains 
brisk and inflation is still strong, especially in the services sector. Inflationary risks 
predominate on the supply side, too. This suggests that monetary policy should be 
data-dependent, in line with the ECB Governing Council ’s communication.

 As the coronavirus pandemic subsided and, observed from the beginning of 2021.
later, in the wake of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, inflation picked up 
sharply in many places. In the group of advanced economies, the annual rate of change 
in the consumer price index ()CPI had risen to 8.6 % by October 2022. Two years earlier, 
it had stood at just 0.7 %. In some major economies, inflation rates even peaked in 
double-digits during the course of 2022. The last time that similarly high rates had been 
recorded was back in the 1980s (see Chart 2.1). Consumer price inflation increased 
significantly in emerging market economies, too.
The remarkable rise in inflation rates worldwide was initially driven by the 
unexpectedly rapid recovery in global demand for goods.  In order to halt the

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 19downturn in the global economy following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic 
and to avoid a protracted period of economic weakness, policymakers around the 
world took extensive monetary and fiscal support measures. Many of these support 
measures were aimed at bolstering aggregate demand. For instance, some countries, 
including the United States, significantly increased unemployment benefits or offset 
their citizens’ income losses through one-off payments. Other countries, particularly in 
Europe, introduced or expanded labour market policies such as short-time work to 
safeguard jobs and income.  At the same time, consumption of contact-intensive 
services (such as visits to restaurants or hairdressers) was severely restricted due to 
public health measures taken to contain the spread of the pandemic. Instead, 
households increasingly purchased goods. As a result of this shift in demand, global 
industrial production rose considerably and global trade experienced a rapid and 
strong recovery (see Chart 2.2). 
The shift in demand towards goods exacerbated pandemic-related supply and 
production bottlenecks and led to price increases at various levels of the value

supply bottlenecks. Cross-border supply chains proved to be especially vulnerable. This

shortage of key industrial intermediate inputs. At times, some regions of the world 
lacked containers to transport goods, while, elsewhere, ships were queuing up at ports. 
One reason for this was the heterogeneous economic developments across regions 
due to local waves of infection and differing policy responses. All of this was 
accompanied by supply disruptions, sharply rising commodity prices, higher transport 
costs and mounting producer prices. Indicators of supply chain disruptions, such as the 
Global Supply Chain Pressure Index compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 
reached new highs (see Chart 2.3, left-hand side). In this environment of sharply rising 
production costs and high demand, enterprises in the manufacturing sector, in 
particular, were also able to significantly increase their mark-ups.  Overall, consumer 
price inflation increased considerably. 
The rise in commodity prices as a result of Russia’s war of aggression against 
Numerous Ukraine intensified the already high global price pressures further. 
commodity prices – especially for energy and food – rose again sharply following the

measures taken to contain the pandemic. Service prices rose significantly, causing the

labour was faced with a labour supply that was, to some extent, subdued as a result of 
the pandemic.  The number of job vacancies rose sharply in many places. In the 
United States during the winter of 2022, for instance, there were two job vacancies for 
every unemployed person. This strengthened the bargaining power of workers who 
had suffered sizeable real income losses due to unexpectedly strong inflation. 
Accordingly, wage growth picked up to a considerable degree. 5)

economists cited supply shortages caused by the pandemic and, later, Russia’s war of 
aggression against Ukraine as the main reason for the sharp rise in consumer prices.  
Others highlighted the role of the extensive monetary and fiscal policy support 
measures that stimulated demand.  In retrospect, an econometric analysis for the 
United States and the euro area suggests that both supply-side and demand-side 
factors were important.  In the United States, however, demand played a much 
greater role.  In the euro area, by contrast, a larger contribution was attributed to 
supply-side influences (see Chart 2.4).   7)

9 For a detailed description of the estimation approach, see Eickmeier and Hofmann (2022). Aggregate factors 
are estimated using a principle component analysis and are decomposed into supply and demand through 
sign restrictions on the factor loadings of inflation and real economic activity. The estimation for the United 
States covers 202 variables in the period from the first quarter of 1970 to the first quarter of 2024. The 
estimation for the euro area covers 83 variables in the period from the first quarter of 2001 to the first quarter 
of 2024.
10 A recent study by Giannone and Primiceri (2024) also suggests that demand-side influences play a major role 
in the euro area.
11 Another econometric analysis using a structural vector autoregressive model points in a similar direction. 
According to this, domestic factors – including strong demand – were the dominant driver of the rise in 
inflation in the United States. In the euro area, just over half of the rise is explained by external factors. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a).

banks in advanced economies, in particular, largely refrained from tightening their 
monetary policies despite the considerable spike in inflation. One likely factor behind 
this was the fact that the rise in prices was, in many places, attributed to temporary 
supply shocks. However, demand also appeared to be broadly robust. Furthermore, the 
inflationary impact of supply-side shortages proved more persistent than originally 
thought in many cases. As the risks of deanchoring inflation expectations and of 
inflation spreading to labour markets increased, central banks in advanced economies 
responded with substantial interest rate hikes. At this point in time, inflation rates in 
most advanced economies were already well above their targets. The Federal Reserve 
System’s Federal Open Market Committee raised monetary policy interest rates in the 
United States by no less than 5.25 percentage points over one-and-a-half years. In the

 At the same time, inflation rates have declined significantly since the end of 2022.
The decline in inflation seen across countries was similarly synchronous to the previous 
increase, albeit less steep at the end of the period under review. In the group of 
advanced economies, the annual rate of the CPI had fallen to 2.8 % by June 2024, 
according to provisional data. Compared with its peak in 2022, this represented a drop 
of almost 6 percentage points. The normalisation of energy prices played a key role in 
this regard. In the case of core components, i.e. excluding energy and food, price 
pressures proved more persistent. This holds especially true for some services. 
Although the CPI core inflation rate in advanced economies declined by 2.6 percentage

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 263 Lessons from the past
In Inflationary episodes and subsequent periods of disinflation are not uncommon. 
the past, too, periods of low and declining inflation were repeatedly interrupted by 
inflationary surges, which were also often due to the interplay between unexpected 
developments on the supply side and the demand side. Especially in the 1970s and 
1980s, this translated into sharp rises in energy prices.  In some cases, households 
and enterprises adjusted their inflation expectations following these developments. 
This is one reason why it was not always possible to curb high inflation quickly. 
Attempts to contain inflation over the long term by means of income policies and price 
controls were unsuccessful.  Successful disinflation periods were generally linked to a 
tightening of monetary policy.
  13) 
 14) 
 15) 
Identifying disinflation episodes using a statistical procedure  allows for 
comparisons between countries and over time.  A common dating method is based on  
a paper by Ball (1994). This identifies phases in which underlying inflation declined 
significantly.  16)  Amongst a large sample of 46 advanced and emerging market 
economies, there have been almost 230 completed episodes of disinflation since the 
1960s according to this method. Among the G20 economies, there were no less than  
55 episodes, three of which were in Germany (see Chart 2.6). These include the curbing 
of inflation following the energy price shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s. Germany 
also experienced disinflation after the end of the reunification boom. Global median 
inflation rates fell by 5 percentage points during periods of disinflation. This almost 
always took several years, however. It is also worth noting that, even in the past, 
disinflation periods often took place in many regions at the same time.

(2022b).

16 Underlying inflation is approximated using a centred moving average of the annualised quarterly percentage 
change in the seasonally adjusted consumer price index over nine quarters. If this measure falls by at least 2 
percentage points between successive local highs and lows, the intervening period is considered to be an 
episode of disinflation. See Ball (1994).

behind its trend. The ground lost due to such setbacks and bouts of weaker growth was 
often not regained quickly.  A popular measure of the economic cost of 
disinflation – known as the sacrifice ratio – is the ratio of GDP  losses, measured as the 
sum of the percentage deviations of GDP  from its trend, to the decline in underlying 
consumer price inflation. On average for the disinflation episodes under consideration, 
the sacrifice ratio has a value of around 1.  This means that each reduction of 1 
percentage point in the inflation rate was accompanied by an average loss of GDP  of 
1 %. In advanced economies, the sacrifice ratio has tended to be somewhat higher.

following the end of the disinflation process. This takes into account any possible late-term effects of 
combating inflation. See Ball (1994). The approach, however, does not account for the possibility that the 
previous surge in inflation may have been the result of exaggerations with above average GDP growth rates. 
This could distort the trend estimate upwards. In this case, GDP losses would tend to be overstated.
18 This is consistent with estimates from the relevant literature. See, for example, Ball (1994), Katayama et al. 
(2019) and Cecchetti et al. (2023).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 28inflation rates should therefore have been widely accompanied by recessions.  
However, there have also been examples of relatively painless disinflation processes in 
the past (see Chart 2.7).  
Both the successes in combating inflation and the associated drops in economic 
 activity are likely to have been, not least, the result of monetary policy tightening.
Especially in recent decades, central banks have preferred to raise monetary policy 
interest rates in order to do so.  Interest rate hikes affect household and corporate

20 In fact, just over two-thirds of the disinflation episodes were accompanied by recessions, which were dated 
using the algorithm from Bry and Boschan (1971). In line with this, Cecchetti et al. (2023) found that all past 
disinflation episodes in the United States coincided with the recessions identified by the National Bureau of 
Economic Research.
21 Among the most popular explanations in the literature for the heterogeneity of disinflation costs are 
differences in the strategies, transparency and independence of central banks, in the wage negotiation 
process and in the openness of economies. Empirically, however, only a few indicators show a robust 
correlation with the sacrifice ratios. What is relatively certain is that short but significant disinflation periods 
incurred fairly low costs. This is often interpreted as a sign that an especially decisive and rapid fight to curb 
inflation can increase the credibility of the central bank. See also Ball (1994), Katayama et al. (2019) and 
Magkonis and Zekente (2020).
22 Previously, operational monetary policy in many places was geared towards controlling the monetary base, 
central bank reserves of the banking system or the exchange rate. In addition to open market operations, 
changes in minimum reserve requirements and foreign exchange market interventions, for example, were 
also used. See Bindseil (2004).

and, ultimately, consumer prices.  
Estimates show the effectiveness of monetary policy interest rate steps in the euro 
area and the United States.  Vector autoregressive models  can be used to 
estimate the dynamic relationships between short-term interest rates, price-adjusted 
and seasonally adjusted GDP  as well as its key expenditure components, and consumer 
price inflation.  In this context, the impact of monetary policy is derived based on 
assumptions about the timing of the transmission process.  An unexpected rise of 
100 basis points in the short-term interest rate in the past was estimated to dampen 
the euro area inflation rate at its peak by just over 1 percentage point. Euro area GDP  
was pushed down by almost 2 % and did not start slowly catching up with the previous 
trend until two-and-a-half years after tightening had begun.  The decline in 
investment, and especially housing investment, was particularly pronounced. In 
Germany, too, these are considered to be sensitive to interest rates (see the 
supplementary information on the impact of monetary policy tightening on housing 
investment in Germany). In the United States, the inflation-dampening and real 
economic effects were qualitatively similar, but less pronounced than in the euro area 
(see Chart 2.8).   23)

26 In addition to GDP, private consumption, gross fixed capital formation, investment in machinery and 
equipment and housing investment – each seasonally and price-adjusted – are entered in the model as 
logarithmic levels. Also included is the annualised quarterly change in the seasonally adjusted consumer price 
indicator relevant for the respective monetary policy. This is the HICP for the euro area and the private 
consumption deflator for the United States. The interest rate used for the United States is the yield on 
government bonds with a residual maturity of one year, and the rate used for the euro area is a one-year 
interbank interest rate (EURIBOR).
27 The recursive identification scheme used here assumes that GDP and its expenditure components as well as 
inflation respond to a monetary policy shock, i.e. an unexpected change in the short-term interest rate, with a 
time lag of one quarter. By contrast, monetary policy responds immediately to unexpected changes in real 
economic activity and inflation. See also Peersman and Smets (2003).
28 These results are broadly consistent with similar estimates from the ECB, which indicate that euro area GDP 
declines by up to 1.25 % three years after an interest rate hike of 100 basis points. See also Lane (2023).
29 The impact of monetary policy also differs across the euro area, as demonstrated by previous analyses that 
used a multi-country model. According to these analyses, the dampening effects of an interest rate hike on the 
real economy tend to be stronger in Germany than in France, Italy or Spain, for example. By contrast, there is 
relatively little drag on consumer price inflation in Germany. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2023b) and Mandler 
et al. (2022).

On the impact of monetary policy tightening on housing investment in 
Germany 
Price-adjusted housing investment in Germany at the end of 2023 was around 10 % 
below its peak in 2020. Previously, housing investment had risen steadily during the 
protracted upswing in the residential real estate market.  The decline in investment 
coincided with the tightening of monetary policy in the euro area from July 2022. 
Housing investment is considered to be particularly interest rate-sensitive, partly 
because it is largely financed on credit.  It is therefore not surprising that the 
tightening of monetary policy was an instrumental factor in the latest decline in 
housing investment. 
A structural vector autoregressive model allows the development of housing 
investment to be decomposed into the contributions of its driving factors. The model 
incorporates the annual rates of change in housing investment, construction prices and 
land prices relating to residential real estate.  The latter two variables can be seen as 
components of housing prices.  In addition, the model comprises the monetary policy 
interest rate and the annual rates of change in real GDP  and in the Harmonised Index 
of Consumer Prices ( ) HICP  for the euro area.
The model distinguishes between various drivers of housing investment by means of 
sign restrictions on the impulse responses. The focus is on housing-specific supply and 
demand shocks as well as monetary policy shocks. Unfavourable housing supply shocks 
are assumed to increase consumer, construction and land prices and dampen housing 
investment. Monetary policy shocks are unexpected policy interest rate changes that 
deviate from the usual response to macroeconomic conditions. Unexpected monetary 
policy tightening dampens consumer price inflation and real GDP  in the euro area, as 
well as housing investment in Germany. However, a monetary policy shock drives 
construction and land prices in different directions. As with other asset prices, the price 
of land falls in response to a restrictive monetary policy shock.  Construction prices, 
on the other hand, rise due to the higher cost of capital tied up in ongoing construction 
projects.  Housing-specific demand shocks are defined as influences that push 
construction and land prices as well as housing investment in the same direction.

Construction and land prices as well as housing investment refer to Germany; the remaining variables refer to the euro

of the effect is not determined beforehand.
According to the results, particularly unfavourable supply shocks have dampened 
housing investment since 2021. Housing investment had increased up to the end of 
2020, partly owing to the favourable monetary policy stance and favourable supply 
conditions. The beneficial effects of housing demand shocks unfolded until 2022. The 
supply-side barriers that dampened housing investment from the beginning of 2021 
likely relate to labour shortages, material shortages and the energy crisis.

9.  Restrictive monetary policy shocks diminished housing investment further from 2022 
onwards, exerting their strongest negative effect as early as the 2022‑23 winter half-
year (October-March). In the first quarter of 2023, this effect alone meant that the 
annual growth rate of housing investment was down by around 2 percentage points. It 
appears that this effect expired towards the end of 2023. Meanwhile, demand for 
housing deteriorated unexpectedly in the second half of 2023.  By contrast, the supply 
side supported housing investment from mid-2023.
According to the results, the restrictive monetary policy stance was thus swiftly and 
markedly transmitted to housing investment in Germany. However, the tightening 
effect is now likely to have peaked already. 
See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021c).
Erceg and Levin (2006) show for the United States that investment in durable goods, such as residential 
property, exhibits a particularly strong and swift reaction to monetary policy shocks. Likewise, calculations 
based on the Bundesbank’s macroeconomic model suggest that housing investment in Germany has the 
strongest reaction of all  expenditure components within the first year following an interest rate GDP
change. For more information on the Bundesbank’s macroeconomic model, see Haertel et al. (2022).
The model's empirical estimation is based on the period from the first quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter 
of 2023.
See Deutsche Bundesbank (2020a, 2020b). The decomposition of housing prices into construction and land 
prices follows the approach used by Davis and Heathcote (2007) as well as Kajuth (2021).
In the calculations, the monetary policy interest rate corresponds to an estimated shadow rate; see Geiger 
and Schupp (2018). The shadow rate estimates the monetary policy stance during the period from 2012 to 
2022, when short-term rates were close to zero and quantitative easing measures were also being 
implemented.
See Davis and Heathcote (2007) as well as Kajuth (2021).
See Christiano et al. (2005) and Mishkin (2007). This assumption, like all the others, refers only to the 
quarter in which the shock occurs. It does not contravene the possible dampening effect of monetary 
policy on construction prices in subsequent periods. An alternative recursive identification strategy, which 
does not assume a direction of impact, also results in the interest rate hike having an immediate positive 
effect on construction prices. It also shows that construction prices do not begin to decline until some time 
after the shock.
The type of shock identification selected is one of several options. For this analysis, however, it has the 
advantage that the contributions of unexpected monetary policy shocks can be distinguished from the 
other demand-side influences on housing investment. It also allows comparisons of these contributions 
with those of supply shocks to housing investment developments.
The at times high contributions of the residuals reflect, for example, the estimation uncertainty regarding 
the extent to which the shocks impact housing investment overall.[9]

outcome of simulations using a variety of macroeconomic models. These simulations 
show that, compared with an unchanged monetary policy, the inflation rate would have 
been markedly and persistently contained. However, real GDP  growth in 2023 alone 
would also have been around 4 percentage points lower than in a scenario without 
monetary policy tightening (see the supplementary information on the macroeconomic 
impact of monetary policy tightening in the euro area). The same is likely to apply to 
other regions of the world, where, in some cases, the monetary policy reins were 
tightened to an even greater extent.   30) 
30 The credibility of monetary policy and its impact on inflation expectations are likely to have played a crucial 
role in determining the degree of tightening required. If inflation expectations were aligned with past 
developments, inflation processes would be more persistent and would require a stronger monetary policy 
response. The costs of disinflation would then be correspondingly higher. See Tetlow (2022) and International 
Monetary Fund (2023).

The macroeconomic impact of monetary policy 
tightening in the euro area
The ECB Governing Council responded to the exceptionally strong rise in inflation in 
the euro area with what has thus far been its most significant interest rate hiking 
cycle since the introduction of the euro.  From July 2022 to September 2023, the ECB 
Governing Council raised its key interest rates by a total of 4.5 percentage points.  From 
a monetary policy perspective, this was necessary in order to put an end to the very 
high dynamics of inflation, which reached double-digits for a time. Following its peak in 
October 2022, the rate of inflation then fell again significantly. Tighter monetary policy 
is likely to have played a role in this and thus paved the way for inflation to return to its 
target of 2 % over the medium term.

a close connection between short-term key interest rates and long-term capital market 
rates. The latter, in turn, are an important determinant of aggregate demand and thus 
also price developments. An increase in key interest rates lowers the rate of inflation by 
dampening aggregate demand. In this context, the overall monetary policy stance is 
not determined by the immediate interest rate step alone. It depends largely on the 
impact on expected short-term interest rates, summarised by the forward curve.  All 
else being equal, if further interest rates hikes are expected, this will shift the forward 
curve upwards. This expectation effect pushes up long-term interest rates, thereby 
amplifying the restrictive monetary policy effect of the current level of key interest rates.

are influenced by a variety of factors. The impact of monetary policy decisions must 
therefore be isolated from these factors.  Second, when assessing monetary policy 
decisions, anticipation of future monetary policy measures must be taken into account. 
Due to these two requirements, we do not use any time series models, but instead only 
(semi-)structural macroeconomic models.  The effects of changes in the forward 
curves over time are first quantified separately and then the cumulative result is 
reported. Finally, there is considerable uncertainty with regard to the relative strength 
of individual transmission channels and time lags in monetary policy. For this reason, 
we use a variety of models to assess the range of outcomes: three structural DSGE  
models ( -BBk DTANK , BBk-FS and EAGLE ) and a large semi-structural model (NiGEM).

differences in how they model expectation formation. In addition, it should be noted 
that the models have been calibrated or estimated using historical data. If transmission 
mechanisms have changed in recent times, this would also have an impact on the 
quantitative effects. In any case, the model simulations highlight the important 
contribution of monetary policy to reducing high rates of inflation.

In principle, the monetary policy stance is measured by the spread between key interest rates and the 
natural rate of interest. The natural interest rate is typically dependent on structural factors and is not 
influenced by monetary policy.
If key interest rates were tightened and the forward curve remained (more or less) constant, the monetary 
policy stance would be hardly affected.
In December 2021, the ECB Governing Council announced that it would normalise its monetary policy 
stance, initially by reducing net purchases under the asset purchase programme ( )APP  and the pandemic 
emergency purchase programme ( ). PEPP  The first interest rate step was taken in July 2022. The reference

Only the effects of Eurosystem interest rate tightening are quantified. This factors out other restrictive 
monetary policy impulses such as a tightening of TLTRO  III conditions or an early unwinding of the central 
bank balance sheet. Previous findings suggest that the latter has a rather small macroeconomic effect; see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2023c).
Time series models likewise allow monetary policy to be considered in isolation. In most cases, however, 
they are only able to measure the effects of unexpected changes in interest rates. This would not fully 
reflect the monetary policy effects and would thus tend to underestimate the macroeconomic effects of 
tightening.
Like many structural models in the literature, the -BBk FS and EAGLE  models overstate the effect of 
anticipated interest rate paths (the “forward guidance puzzle”; see Del Negro et al. (2023)). For the 
quantification, those models therefore assume that 30 % of agents form their expectations based not on 
the forward curve, but instead on the (counterfactual) model-endogenous monetary policy rule. This 
approach, as well as the selection of 30 %, is based on Coenen et al. (2022).
This is in line with the estimates in European Central Bank (2023b).

true for the euro area.  Only in a few past episodes did underlying inflation ease at a

to the end of the period under review. Even during a macroeconomic recovery, further losses would therefore 
accumulate until the gap has been closed.

processes contribute to the global surge in inflation in 2021 and 2022, but they also 
benefited the disinflation process later on as they dwindled away. Lockdowns and 
pandemic-related supply chain disruptions no longer posed a major obstacle to global 
production, at the latest when China abandoned its zero- COVID  policy at the end of 
2022. The shift in demand back to services also mitigated bottlenecks in the supply of 
intermediate inputs and on transport routes. The intertwining of supply chains was 
smooth once again, which boosted global production. At the same time, this curbed 
price pressures at upstream stages. The decline in energy commodity prices from their 
highs at the outbreak of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine had a similar 
effect. Many non-energy commodities also dropped significantly in price. Overall, 
therefore, producer prices for goods in advanced economies declined for the most part 
over the course of last year.

of monetary policy restriction. Moreover, fiscal policy remained rather expansionary, 
and normalisation following the - COVID 19 pandemic also bolstered economic activity. 
Against this backdrop, a large part of the expenditure components of real GDP  and, 
above all, employment developed much more robustly than in prior periods of 
disinflation in the United States and also elsewhere (see the supplementary information 
on the background to the mild disinflation process in the United States). However, this 
also entails risks to the further disinflation process.

paused only briefly in the first half of 2022. In 2023 as a whole, US economic output 
grew by as much as 2.5 % in price-adjusted terms. Since then, expansion has continued 
at somewhat more moderate rates. Despite its exceptionally tight monetary policy, the 
US economy steered well clear of a recession. This was unlike almost every previous 
phase of disinflation since the 1970s.  The sacrifice ratio, which expresses GDP  losses 
relative to the decline in inflation, has thus far been significantly below its historical 
average.  Many economic observers – including the OECD  – are currently predicting 
that the return to price stability will succeed without major losses being incurred.
Decisive contributions to the soft monetary policy landing thus far have been made

components can help in gaining a better understanding of the United States’ 
remarkable economic resilience in the current disinflation process.  Labour market 
developments stand out in particular. As in virtually all advanced economies, 
employment in the United States rose throughout the period under review. 
Employment growth was even stronger than usual under calm economic 
circumstances. Taken in isolation, this supported macroeconomic activity and 
dampened the costs of disinflation. There are no signs of a significant deterioration in 
labour market conditions in the near future, either. In this respect, the current 
disinflation process clearly distinguishes itself from historical patterns. The higher 
sacrifice ratios in the past were accompanied by considerably reduced labour input. 
Labour productivity developments, by contrast, have been somewhat more subdued 
since the spring of 2022 than typical during previous phases of disinflation (see Chart 
2.14, left-hand side). However, this analysis does not take account of the fact that 
labour productivity had previously risen sharply within the context of the - COVID 19 
pandemic. [1]

investment has declined over the past two years to a similar extent as in previous 
disinflation phases. The exceptionally rapid tightening of monetary policy is likely to 
have been an important factor here. By contrast, private consumption in the United 
States has recently grown broadly in line with its trend, partly because households 
made heavy use of the savings that they had built up during the pandemic.  Public 
sector demand continued to expand as well. Together with buoyant private 
consumption, this kept the sacrifice ratio low. According to current forecasts, this is 
unlikely to change significantly in the near future. In earlier episodes in which the 
United States successfully kept high inflation rates at bay, a large part of the drop in 
activity was attributable to private and public consumption expenditure. Private non-
residential investment, by contrast, did not play a major role in the past either. Over the 
last two years, growth in this type of investment has even been exceptionally buoyant 
and, by calculation, depressed the sacrifice ratio (see Chart 2.14, right-hand side). This 
may also have been attributable to fiscal policy incentives.

that interest rates would be cut only more slowly.  If persistently high consumer price 
inflation calls for monetary policy to remain tighter for even longer, this could also 
cloud the economic outlook.
Only between the end of 2011 and mid-2015 did inflation also decline markedly without having a 
significant impact on the economy. However, as unemployment decreased only slowly following the global 
financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve refrained from raising interest rates at that time.
As in the main article, the dating of disinflation phases and the calculation of sacrifice ratios are conducted 
following Ball (1994).
See OECD  (2024). 
For a similar analysis in the context of economic upturns, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2013).
In other advanced economies, the reduction of these excess savings is proceeding slowly at best. See de 
Soyres et al. (2023). 
This applies, for example, to the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS  and Science Act. For a discussion of 
the effects on construction investment in selected sectors, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2023d).
In December 2023, the members of the Federal Reserve System’s Open Market Committee still expected 
that inflation, as measured by the private consumption deflator, would continue to decline significantly. 
They projected median inflation rates of 2.4 % for the final quarter of 2024 and 2.1 % for the final quarter of 
2025. By June 2024, these forecasts had been revised upwards to 2.6 % and 2.3 %, respectively. Most 
recently, a key interest rate of 4.1 % was considered appropriate for the end of 2025. Just six months 
earlier, the expectation was that interest rates would be cut to 3.6 %. See Federal Open Market Committee 
(2023 and 2024).[7]

particular, this was due in part to the labour force participation rate remaining slightly

economy directly through higher government demand. Public funds were also 
increasingly spent on investment and production incentives for future technologies and 
key industries.  Private investment in these sectors, which had already been rising, 
was further stimulated by this.

investment in buildings and equipment has been on a general decline in many 
advanced economies. It is increasingly being replaced by investment in information 
and communication technologies and intellectual property products.  Intangible 
assets of this nature are eligible as collateral for credit operations only to a limited 
extent and are characterised by rapid amortisation. They should therefore be less 
sensitive to interest rate changes.  The real economy may therefore have been less 
affected by the sharp monetary policy tightening of recent years than historical 
relationships would suggest. The tendency to take on longer-term debt at fixed 
conditions increases transmission lags. Many households, but also enterprises, were 
thus able to lock in the favourable financing conditions from the low interest rate 
period following the global financial crisis for years.  As a result, the rise in interest 
rates is only gradually becoming apparent as a cost factor as existing liabilities are 
rolled over and new borrowing occurs. This is likely to have markedly slowed the drag 
on both investment and private consumption.

stand relative to their equilibrium value, which is associated with price stability and 
normal aggregate capacity utilisation.  There are indications for a number of 
advanced economies that this natural interest rate may have risen since the pandemic.
 This also applies to the euro area.  Such an increase in equilibrium interest rates 
could have lessened the tightening impulse from higher policy rates. However, these 
assessments are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Additionally, from a longer-
term perspective, estimated equilibrium rates remain extraordinarily low. 41)

Diminishing supply-side disruptions also played an important role. Other factors 
slowed and obscured the transmission of the rise in interest rates to the real economy. 
Owing to this combination of factors, recessions were avoided in most countries. The 
robust economy is reducing the pressure on firms and workers to show restraint in 
terms of pricing and wage demands. As a result, consumer price inflation in some cases 
even intensified again in seasonally adjusted terms at the quarterly and monthly level 
at the start of 2024 (see Chart 2.17). 
 In particular, the inflation of services prices is proving extraordinarily persistent.
Consumer price inflation for services in June 2024 remained at just over 4 % in the euro

likely to be the persistently strong wage growth, which is particularly significant in the 
labour-intensive services sector (see Chart 2.18). In addition, productivity growth is 
exceptionally subdued, especially in the euro area. The high wage growth is therefore 
being transmitted almost entirely to unit labour costs. In view of the labour markets 
remaining very tight and the real wage losses that have been incurred, wage dynamics 
are expected to ease off only slowly. This is likely to make it more difficult to achieve a 
swift return to price stability. 
 A stronger economic recovery could delay a further decline in inflation rates.

decided to lower the three Eurosystem key interest rates by 25 basis points each given 
the successes made in the fight against inflation. The central banks of other major

that time. In the United States, too, members of the Federal Open Market Committee 
are signalling an interest rate reversal. However, the still too strong inflation, 
uncertainty about the actual degree of monetary policy restriction and various upside

tightening cycle

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 60Over the past few years, growth in loans granted by German banks to domestic non-
financial corporations has been characterised by unusually strong ups and downs. 
Although monetary policy responded to the inflationary surge that began in 2021 with 
substantial tightening, loan growth initially accelerated further to just under 14 % by 
October 2022. From the fourth quarter of 2022, however, net lending declined sharply; 
most recently, credit growth was close to zero. This development was reflected across 
all categories of banks, maturities and economic sectors. 
This article presents model-based analyses to establish whether such developments in 
lending were out of the ordinary when viewed alongside economic and interest rate 
developments, and examines the role played by loan supply and loan demand factors. 
It is apparent that the government support loans granted to selected energy suppliers 
in 2022 were a key factor in the initially observed increase in loan growth. In addition, 
the sharp rise in input and storage costs in 2022 increased the need for short-term 
financing across the corporate sector. 
The downturn in net lending began at the end of that year. Bundesbank models 
suggest that the decline in loan growth and the current stagnation are mainly 
attributable to the adverse macro environment, which was characterised in particular 
by a slowdown in economic activity, high inflation rates and rising interest rates. Banks 
responded to the rapid, steep rise in financial market interest rates by raising lending 
rates accordingly. Additionally, they tightened their lending policies in view of the 
increased credit risk on the corporate side. However, in our models, there is no sign of 
a conspicuous restriction of credit supply based on purely bank-related factors. This 
result is consistent with the continued stability of the German banking system.
The adverse macro environment and heightened uncertainty about the economic and 
geopolitical outlook, for their part, dampened private investment. This reduced the 
financing needs of non-financial corporations for equipment and buildings. Moreover, 
many enterprises already had sufficient internal financing at their disposal, not least as 
a result of high profits in recent years. Although the decline in loan demand caused by 
these factors was relatively strong, it was largely in line with historical patterns overall.
The Bundesbank’s current forecast for loans to non-financial corporations anticipates a 
gradual recovery over the course of 2024. The German economy, which is slowly 
regaining momentum according to the Bundesbank’s June Forecast for Germany, plus 
the gradual reversal of interest rate hikes by monetary policymakers currently 
anticipated in the financial markets, should bolster loan growth. Major bank-side 
restrictions on lending are not expected at present. However, the projected credit

tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 61growth rate is rising only slowly, as enterprises tend to use their remaining internal 
funds first during an economic upturn. In addition, the initially still difficult investment 
environment is dampening loan demand.

The strong and rapid rise in euro area inflation, which began in 2021, required a 
decisive monetary policy response.  The euro area has been hit by various supply and 
demand shocks in recent years. Increased demand for goods, also bolstered by 
extensive economic policy measures, coincided with pandemic-related production and 
supply bottlenecks. This drove commodity prices, transport costs, and producer and 
consumer prices up sharply. The further rise in commodity prices brought about by the 
Russian war of aggression against Ukraine exacerbated the already high price 
pressures. Finally, the normalisation of demand for services following the lifting of 
mobility and contact restrictions contributed to the price increase.  Euro area inflation 
reached a record high of 10.6 % in October 2022. In order to ensure price stability over 
the medium term, the  Governing Council decided at the end of 2021 to move away ECB
from the low interest rate environment of previous years and tighten monetary policy. 
It ended its purchase programmes and raised key interest rates by a total of 450 basis 
points in rapid steps between July 2022 and September 2023. Having held key interest 
rates steady for nine months following this period, the Governing Council lowered 
them by 25 basis points in June 2024. At the same time, it stressed the data 
dependence of its future monetary policy path. 
Weaker economic activity and higher interest rates weighed increasingly on net 
lending  in Germany.  The dampening of loan dynamics was intentional on the part of 
monetary policymakers.  A significant degree of monetary policy impulses are 
typically transmitted via the banking system. Banks’ own increased financing costs are 
passed through to their customers in the form of higher lending rates. As a result, loan 
demand on the part of non-financial corporations  and households is lower. They 
invest less, and economic growth weakens. This leads, with a certain time lag, to a 
weakening of inflationary pressures.  1)

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 63At the start of the monetary policy tightening cycle, however, growth in corporate 
lending picked up significantly, declining steeply only from the end of 2022.  The 
annual growth rate of loans issued by banks in Germany to domestic non-financial 
corporations accelerated significantly between 2014 and 2019, reaching 5 % at the end 
of 2019.  After a brief slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, loan growth picked 
up again, reaching its highest level since 1992, at just under 14 %, in October 2022 (see 
Chart 3.1). Only then was the changed macro environment reflected in loans to 
enterprises: their annual rate of growth declined rapidly and has been hovering around 
0 % since the fourth quarter of 2023. Such strong ups and downs in the rate of loan 
growth had only previously been observed during German reunification and the global 
financial crisis in 2008.

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 642 Developments in lending and macroeconomic 
environment
Empirical models can be used to analyse the extent to which the ups and downs of 
loan growth line up with economic and interest rate developments.  The steep 
upward and downward movement of loan growth and the current weak lending 
dynamics raise the question of whether lending to non-financial corporations reacted 
more strongly to the changed macro environment than would have been expected in 
view of past correlations. To answer this question, actual loan growth since the start of 
the interest rate tightening period can be compared with hypothetical developments 
derived from model relationships. Chart 3.2 presents the outcome of such an exercise 
on the basis of a forecasting model that describes loan developments using the 
investment ratio, the yield spread between long-term corporate and government 
bonds, the lending rate and the development of credit standards set by banks. As 
outlined in the  at the end of this article, supplementary information on loan forecasts
the model is initially estimated for the period up to the end of 2021. Loan 
developments are subsequently forecast for the period from the beginning of 2022 to 
the current end using the estimated model relationships and the actual development of 
the macro environment. 
On balance, although loan growth was relatively weak from mid-2023 onwards, it 
remained broadly in line with the estimated historical pattern.  Chart 3.2 compares 
the actual growth in loans to enterprises (black line) with hypothetical developments 
(blue line) calculated on the basis of the forecast simulation described above since the 
start of the interest rate tightening cycle. The results of the forecast simulation are 
naturally subject to great uncertainty, and this is depicted by a forecast range. 
Generally speaking, actual loan developments progress largely in line with this 
uncertainty band. That said, the individual fluctuations in actual loan developments are 
more substantial than projected by the model: for instance, actual loan growth in 2022 
is greater to begin with, lying slightly above the uncertainty band in the second quarter 
of the year. The decline in growth from autumn 2022 onwards is also steeper than 
forecast; in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, actual growth is below the 
uncertainty band. However, the ups and downs in loan growth were significantly 
amplified by aid loans from the  ( ) to selected energy KfW Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
suppliers (see the ). Adjusting the loan series for this one-off factor, following chapter
actual loan growth as a whole remains within the uncertainty band (grey line).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 65A second empirical model also reinforces the assessment that lending to 
enterprises has, on the whole, followed the historical pattern over the past two 
years.  The forecasting model used above forms the basis of the Bundesbank’s regularly 
produced loan forecasts. It focuses on forecasting quality and is therefore 
parsimonious. By comparison, the macro-financial Bayesian  model described in the VAR
 section at the end of the article comprises a larger second supplementary information
number of monetary, financial and real economic data. It can thus be used for analyses 
of a greater number of questions, including the identification of different economic 
shocks and their effects. In the simulation described above, this larger model produces 
comparable results, reinforcing the conclusion that loans to enterprises have largely 
developed in line with historical patterns over the past two years and that lending 
dynamics are not unusually weak at the current end.


Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 663 Loan dynamics increased on the back of one-off 
factors up to October 2022
Sharply higher commodity prices as well as input and storage costs heightened the 
German corporate sector’s borrowing needs.  A surprisingly strong recovery in 
demand for goods exacerbated pandemic-related supply and production bottlenecks. 
As a result, commodity prices, transport and material costs rose sharply. German 
enterprises were hit particularly hard by these developments. In addition, the 
unavailability of key intermediate products and materials caused disruptions in 
production and sales. This led to an increase in storage costs for unfinished products. 
On balance, demand for short-term loans to finance inventories and working capital 
rose sharply.  An evaluation of individual firm data from the Bundesbank’s 
representative survey of German firms (Bundesbank Online Panel Firms (BOP-F))  also 
illustrates the relationship between supply bottlenecks and lending: the share of firms 
that anticipate both decreased access to necessary intermediate inputs in the next year 
and an increase in their need for credit financing rose significantly up to mid-2022 (see 
Chart 3.3). 6)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 67Extensive government aid loans to energy suppliers were another key factor in the 
steep rise in loan growth in the 2022 summer half-year.  Sharply higher gas and 
electricity prices, combined with hedging transactions and other commitments, caused 
considerable financial difficulties for some energy suppliers. In order to safeguard the 
energy supply in Germany, the  granted exceptionally high loans to a number of KfW
selected companies in the energy sector on behalf of the Federal Government.  
Looking at all loans to enterprises on aggregate, this is evidenced by the steep increase 
in the contribution made by the category of banks “Banks with special, development 
and other central support tasks,” to which the  belongs, to the annual growth rate KfW
of loans to enterprises; this category’s contribution to growth rose by 4½ percentage 
points in 2022 (see Chart 3.1). In November 2022, it accounted for around one-third of 
the growth rate of all loans to enterprises. 
The after-effects of the extensive fiscal policy support measures taken in the early 
stages of both the coronavirus pandemic and of a highly expansionary monetary 
policy also boosted lending in 2022.  The empirical macro-model described  in the

The analysis attributes the acceleration of credit growth impulses, i.e. structural shocks. 
from the end of 2021 onwards to what are, from the perspective of the model, 
unexpectedly strong developments in macroeconomic demand (positive aggregate 
demand shocks) and an unusually accommodative monetary policy (expansionary 
monetary policy shocks) following the first few quarters of the coronavirus pandemic 
(Chart 3.17 in this supplementary information). Other structural economic shocks, by 
contrast, played no major role in loan developments. The aggregate demand shocks 
are, at least in part, likely to reflect the extensive pandemic-related fiscal policy support 
measures taken as well as, later on, the expansionary effect of pent-up demand during 
the pandemic. The model results suggest that the decline in credit growth from mid-
2022 onwards is partly due to the gradual end of the supportive effect of the demand 
shocks and the tightening of monetary policy over the course of 2022.
The monetary policy tightening initiated at the end of 2021 likewise boosted 
demand for bank loans in the short term.  In December 2021, the Governing Council 
of the  decided to discontinue net asset purchases in response to the rapid and ECB
strong rise in inflation in the euro area. This change in monetary policy led to a 
significant rise in capital market interest rates. By contrast, the monetary policy impulse 
affected banks’ lending rates with a certain time lag, as was to be expected based on 
historical patterns.  The fact that interest rates responded at different speeds was an 
incentive for enterprises with access to the capital market to increasingly finance 
themselves via loans rather than debt securities. In addition, loan demand was 
strengthened by the fact that, to secure interest rates, some enterprises took out still 
relatively cheap medium and long-term bank loans earlier than planned in anticipation 
of a rise in lending rates. 10)

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 694 Subsequent phase of weakening loan dynamics
The interplay of tighter lending conditions and a decline in loan demand drove the 
slowdown in loan dynamics in the corporate sector observed from autumn 2022 
onwards.  Banks responded to the slowdown in economic activity and the turnaround in 
monetary policy interest rates resulting from the acceleration in inflation by gradually 
tightening their lending conditions. Enterprises, for their part, demanded fewer loans. 
However, given the sharp decline in loan growth and the relatively weak loan dynamics 
compared with the model forecast, the question arises as to whether this is driven 
more by loan supply or loan demand. A strong tightening in loan supply carries the risk 
that weak lending and the economic downturn could inadvertently be mutually 
reinforcing. Overly weak loan demand could also trigger such a macro-financial 
feedback loop if it is based on excessive corporate debt, and if investment that is, in 
fact, profitable is put on hold. This chapter explores the question based on various 
statistics and model results.
4.1 Higher lending rates and tighter lending conditions
Given the sharp rise in key monetary policy interest rates, it was to be expected that 
banks would raise their lending rates and tighten their lending conditions – and that 
is in line with monetary policymakers’ intentions.  The question is, however, whether 
banks’ reaction was mainly due to the more adverse macro environment or whether it 
was notably reinforced by purely bank-related factors, such as capital or liquidity 
constraints. The latter could trigger major feedback effects between the financial 
system and developments in the real economy, which would dampen the economic 
slowdown further. Such a development would go beyond the usual intended effects of 
monetary policy and would therefore be undesirable. 
The rise of interest rates in the financial markets led banks to increase lending rates 
on loans to enterprises significantly – but within the expected range.  After the  ECB
started raising its key policy rates in July 2022, interest rates in the money and capital 
markets continued to rise with each upward revision of rate hike expectations, with 
corresponding repercussions for banks’ financing costs. The banks, in turn, responded 
by tightening lending rates (see Chart 3.4). Empirical models based on historical 
relationships show that changes in market interest rates are generally almost fully 
 11) 

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 70reflected in lending rates on loans to enterprises, albeit with a certain delay.  
Although interest rates in the financial markets began to decline somewhat again in 
November 2023, the aggregate lending rate broadly remained at its high level until 
May 2024, thus continuing to have a dampening effect on lending. 
The data collected in the Bank Lending Survey ( )BLS  suggest that banks also made 
their lending conditions more restrictive.  Since the first quarter of 2022, the banks 
questioned in the  have continuously tightened their credit standards for loans to BLS
enterprises, i.e. their internal loan approval criteria (see Chart 3.5). The intensity of the 
tightening has eased somewhat since the second half of 2023. While the scale of the 
overall tightening was considerable, it was much less pronounced than the restrictive 
adjustments made during the global financial crisis. In addition, banks applied stricter 
standards to their credit terms and conditions, for example by increasing margins or 
imposing more stringent collateral requirements.

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 71According to BLS data, the main reason for the tightening of credit standards was 
the increase in credit risk on the corporate side.  In particular, respondents to the 
survey stated that the economic situation and outlook had deteriorated, in their 
assessment. Furthermore, they noted that industry-specific and enterprise-specific 
factors and a deterioration in borrowers’ creditworthiness had contributed to the 
tightening (see the supplementary information entitled “Interaction between credit 
). In addition, the surveyed banks risk, bank credit supply policy and loan negotiations”
reported a decline in their risk tolerance. By contrast, bank-related factors affecting the 
cost of funds and balance sheet constraints for banks contributed only marginally to 
the tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises overall, according to the 
surveyed bank managers.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 72Supplementary information
Interaction between credit risk, bank credit supply 
policy and loan negotiations
Disaggregated data illustrate that the deteriorated macro environment has led to a 
particularly pronounced increase in credit risk for construction firms and real estate 
firms as well as for smaller enterprises.  Data from the analytical credit dataset 
(AnaCredit), the  and the Bundesbank’s BOP-F survey suggest that, during the BLS
period of monetary policy tightening, banks adjusted their lending policy depending on 
the borrowers’ economic sector and firm size. As regards credit risk, according to 
AnaCredit the average probability of default of firms in the construction and real estate 
sectors as well as of smaller enterprises, weighted across all credit claims in the 
respective segments, rose more sharply in 2023 than the probability of default of all 
firms (see Chart 3.6). However, compared to the average of all firms, it does not appear 
to be exceptionally high thus far  In the construction and real estate sectors, the .
increased credit risk can be explained in terms of the turnaround in the real estate 
market, which, in both sectors, led to an above-average deterioration in gross value 
added and to a rise in the number of corporate insolvencies. Small businesses are likely 
to be less able to circumvent the currently adverse business environment owing to the 
less diversified nature of their sources of income and a deterioration in access to capital 
markets. 

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 73Banks reflected the elevated credit risk in part by tightening their lending policies.  
Empirical models based on historical interrelationships show that, as from June 2023, 
banks raised their lending rates somewhat more steeply than would have been 
expected based on the models. This is probably because banks increased their risk 
premia against a backdrop of weak economic growth and an uncertain corporate 
outlook. In addition, the  banks cited industry-specific and firm-specific factors as BLS
additional reasons for tightening their credit standards. The surveyed banks reported 
tightening their credit standards more strongly for, in particular, construction firms and 
real estate firms since mid-2022 than for those in other economic sectors (see Chart 
3.7). For small and medium-sized enterprises, however, the  banks did not report an BLS
unusually severe tightening of credit standards.


Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 74Mirroring the ,BLS  firms responding to the Bundesbank’s BOP-F survey have 
reported a deterioration in loan negotiations since the beginning of the period of 
monetary policy tightening.  For the entire corporate sector, the BOP-F survey shows 
that the share of firms that have received loans either at reduced amounts or at less 
favourable conditions, or whose loan negotiations ended without a deal, has gone up 
since the beginning of the period of monetary policy tightening (see Chart 3.8).  For 
ease of comparison, it makes sense to merge the six possible responses from which 
firms can choose when assessing their loan negotiations into a single indicator. For  
each loan category, the indicator is calculated by the sum of the number of weighted 
responses “Loan approved, conditions as desired” multiplied by + 1, the number of 
weighted responses “Loan approved but for a loan amount reduced and/or less 
favourable conditions” multiplied by − 0.5, and the number of weighted responses “Loan 
negotiations concluded without a deal” multiplied by − 1.

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 75On the other hand, data from the BOP-F survey do not suggest that the tightening 
of the credit supply has hit micro and small enterprises disproportionately hard. 
Since the beginning of the period of monetary policy tightening, the loan negotiation 
indicator for firms in each of the individual size classes has shown a fundamentally 
similar trajectory, albeit at different levels (see Chart 3.9). This suggests that, for 
structural reasons, loan negotiations for micro and small enterprises lead to results 
that are, in their view, less favourable than for medium-sized or large enterprises. 
During the period of monetary policy tightening, the levels of loan negotiation 
indicators calculated by enterprise size shifted markedly downward. On balance, 
however, a disproportionately strong tightening of banks’ lending to micro and small 
enterprises cannot be inferred from the indicator.
In the BOP-F survey, construction firms [3] assessed the results of their loan 
negotiations as being increasingly worse, including in comparison with other 
economic sectors.  Whereas, according to the loan negotiation indicator, the 
construction sector’s bargaining position was better than average at the end of 2021,  
it has increasingly deteriorated since then (see Chart 3.9). Most recently, the indicator 
value was below the average of all economic sectors.

The weighted responses of firms whose loan negotiations had not yet been concluded at the time of the 
survey are entered into the indicator with a factor of zero. For the purpose of calculating the indicator 
value, the sum of the individual weighted responses, multiplied by the relevant factors, is reported per 
quarter and loan category as a percentage of the weighted number of firms that negotiated loans in the 
respective quarter. 
Separate data on firms providing residential and other real estate services are not collected in the BOP-F 
survey. 


Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 77 Enterprises did not perceive this tightening of loan supply as exceptionally strong.  
In the corresponding surveys conducted by the ifo Institute and the Bundesbank 
(BOP- F), enterprises have noted a significant deterioration in the financing 
environment.  However, the financing environment is not considered to be noticeably 
difficult when compared with previous periods and other obstacles to business activity 
(such as a  shortage of skilled workers or insufficient demand).  
The banks surveyed as part of the BLS do not regard balance sheet constraints on 
the part of banks as currently playing a major role in lending to enterprises, which 
is consistent with the overall sound health of the German banking sector.  Before the 
start of the monetary policy tightening cycle, there was little indication that banks’ 
balance sheet constraints played a relevant role in lending.  Looking at developments 
since the start of the tightening, there is scant evidence to date that this assessment 
has changed. The German banking system’s liquidity situation remains favourable and 
the sector’s  ratio has continued to rise in trend terms.  All in all, banks’ net CET1
interest income has likewise increased so far. That said, value adjustments were made 
on the securities held as a result of the rise in interest rates, weighing on profitability in 
2022.  At the same time, only a moderate amount of credit risk has materialised so 
far. Although the share of non-performing loans to enterprises on German banks’ 
books has risen since mid-2022, it remains at a very low level.  Overall, the current 
situation in the banking system in Germany can be seen as stable with no indications of 
significant restrictions in the supply of loans due to bank-related factors. 
 Empirical models also provide no evidence of significant restrictive loan supply 
shocks beyond the impact of the weakened macro environment.  The last two items  
of supplementary information at the end of the article present two empirical macro 
models that allow the identification of loan supply shocks. The first approach uses the 
medium-sized macro model already described in Chapter 2 , which applies monetary, 
financial and real economic data to identify various economic shocks relevant to  lending  
(see the supplementary information on the macro-financial Bayesian VAR model ). The 
second model examines lending in a smaller model framework, using the BLS 
banks’ assessment of loan supply and loan demand to identify the shocks (see the 
supplementary information on the quantitative importance of loan supply and loan 
). The models thus use different information but both come to the conclusion demand 12)

tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 78that purely bank-related factors were not a major factor in the sharp slowdown in loan 
growth from autumn 2022 onwards and during the subsequent period of very low 
growth. 
Rather, the model-based decomposition of loan growth suggests that the sharp 
decline in loan supply and loan demand from autumn 2022 onwards is mainly 
attributable to the weakened macro environment.  Using observations from the  BLS
and other relevant variables, the model presented in the supplementary information on 
 decomposes loan growth the quantitative importance of loan supply and loan demand
into the impact of the macro environment and additional loan supply or loan demand 
effects. The model results suggest that the sharp decline in loan growth from the 
fourth quarter of 2022 onwards can be explained mainly by the deterioration in the 
macroeconomic environment (see Chart 3.18 in this supplementary information). The 
model also identifies consistently negative loan demand shocks from the end of 2020; 
their size and thus their quantitative significance for credit growth are relatively small, 
however. 
4.2 Weakening of loan demand, mainly due to the deterioration in the 
macro environment
The weakness of loan demand resulted from the interplay of several factors.  The 
fact that the model presented in the supplementary information on the quantitative 
 points to the existence of negative loan importance of loan supply and loan demand
demand shocks is consistent with the forecast simulations presented in , Chapter 2
showing that loan dynamics were relatively weak from mid-2023 onwards. The 
following section describes the individual factors that have dampened enterprises’ 
demand for loans. We will first demonstrate the importance of macroeconomic 
developments for the corporate sector as a whole. Second, we will examine the role of 
alternative financing options in the corporate sector and take a look at enterprises and 
their economic conditions at the disaggregated level. On the whole, it is clear that the 
decline in loan demand was also largely driven by the weakened macro environment. 
4.2.1 Factors underlying the slowdown in demand
The BLS provides a good overview of the drivers of loan demand: the surveyed 
banks attribute the decline in loan demand from autumn 2022 onwards mainly to 
the dwindling willingness to invest and the rise in interest rates.  Furthermore, there 
was evidence from several banks surveyed in the  that uncertainty about the BLS
economic outlook in Germany and geopolitics in general also dampened enterprises’

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 79demand for loans.   banks believe that the weakening of loan demand in the BLS
current tightening cycle is far more pronounced than during the global financial crisis 
and than in 2012 and 2013, when loan dynamics cooled in the wake of the sovereign 
debt crisis (see Chart 3.10). 
The declining willingness to invest should be viewed against the backdrop of the 
effects of the deteriorating macro environment, which are hitting the corporate 
sector in Germany comparatively hard.  The sharp rise in energy costs and weak 
foreign demand weighed on industrial output throughout the euro area, but in 
Germany the energy price shock hit the industry-based economy with its high 
dependence on imported energy commodities particularly hard. The weakness in 
global trade was also felt more strongly in Germany owing to firms’ strong focus on 
exports. Heightened geopolitical tensions also exacerbated enterprises’ uncertainty 
with regard to future energy supplies and their cost, as well as to disruptions to

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 80international trade links. There was also uncertainty about the challenges the green 
and digital transformations and demographic change pose to enterprises and 
policymakers. 
Moreover, the strong rise in the interest rate level also led to a postponement of 
investment on aggregate.  In December 2023, the enterprises surveyed by the  ifo
Institute reported that they had reduced their originally planned investments by 8.4 % 
on average over the past one and a half years due to the higher interest rate level.  
However, these adjustments were not evenly distributed across the corporate sector: 
rather, it emerged that 80 % of the surveyed enterprises did not adjust their investment 
plans at all. By contrast, enterprises that chose to adjust their investment plans typically 
reduced them on a larger scale. The results of the Bundesbank BOP-F survey are 
consistent with this. According to this survey, around 15 % of the enterprises surveyed 
reduced their spending on innovation by 50 % or more in 2022 and 2023 as a result of 
the ’s interest rate hikes. In addition, the responses suggest that the effect ECB
increased the more debt an enterprise had outstanding (see Chart 3.11). More highly 
indebted enterprises also disproportionately chose to put their investments on hold.  
This can be explained by the higher debt service and, as a consequence, the increasing 
relevance of interest rate changes in the event of new borrowing or interest rate 
adjustments. 18) 
 19) 
18 See Best et al. (2024).
19 However, the number of more highly indebted enterprises is not high: only just over 3 % of the enterprises 
questioned in the BOP-F survey reported that the residual debt of all bank loans outstanding at the time of the 
survey amounted to 70 % or more of their total assets in the fourth quarter of 2023. Just over 50 % of the 
enterprises surveyed reported that they currently have no bank loans on their balance sheets.

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 81
Demand for bank loans was also weakened by the fact that firms were, on 
aggregate, able to resort to significant liquidity buffers as alternative financing.  The  
non-financial corporate sector entered the tightening period with sufficient liquidity 
buffers, not least as a result of extensive government coronavirus aid. A significant 
portion of these buffers are still available at present. In addition, non-financial 
corporations were able to generate large profits on aggregate in 2022 and probably 
also in 2023. They managed to expand their profit margins in an environment of strong 
demand – which was in part driven by catch-up effects after the pandemic – and supply-
side restrictions such as supply bottlenecks. Parts of the corporate sector generated a 
turnover increase that went well beyond the lagged increase in employee 
compensation.  20)  In isolation, these profits strengthened the internal financing options 
of the enterprises concerned. Since the beginning of 2022, these have, on aggregate, 
been largely sufficient to finance the rather weak investment in recent years  
(see Chart 3.12).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 82Furthermore, the repayment of short-term loans granted in large volumes during 
the energy crisis in 2022 also dampened lending.  As tensions in the energy 
markets subsided, the need for government support for selected energy suppliers 
steadily declined. A large proportion of the loans granted were repaid in a timely 
manner, with the last of this energy support assistance being repaid by the end of the 
first quarter of 2024.  In addition, global supply chain problems have eased since mid-
2022 and input and storage costs have again declined. The need for short-term funding 
normalised across the corporate sector as a result, leading to above-average short-
term loan redemptions in 2023.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 834.2.2 Broad-based decline in demand despite heterogeneity in the corporate sector
The identification of the deteriorated macro environment as the main driver of loan 
weakness fits with the broad-based decline in lending.  Since the end of 2022, banks’ 
net lending has weakened across all categories of banks, loan maturities and economic 
sectors (see Charts 3.1, 3.3 and 3.13). Although there were individual loan categories in 
which the decline was less pronounced, the general downward trend affected all 
categories. A similar picture emerges for enterprises’ overall external financing: from 
the end of 2022, German enterprises not only took out fewer loans from German 
banks, but they also significantly reduced their borrowing via loans from other sectors 
as well as debt securities, shares and other equity.
Although loan demand weakened broadly, a disaggregated view of loan data shows 
that individual economic sectors were affected in quite different ways.  Loans to the 
manufacturing sector declined particularly sharply, especially for the manufacture of 
machinery and equipment and chemicals industry sectors. This is in line with the 
slowdown in industrial activity in Germany.


Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 84By contrast, the changed interest rate environment hit nominal demand for loans in 
the construction and real estate sector  less substantially than expected.  The 
sharp rise in construction and funding costs triggered a cyclical turnaround in the real 
estate market after an upswing of many years; the annual growth rate of real private 
construction investment fell into negative territory in 2021 and remained there until the 
end of 2023. In line with this,  banks have observed an above-average decline in BLS
demand for loans among construction and real estate firms since mid-2022. However, 
the negative impact of the interest rate reversal on loan demand in the construction 
and real estate sector was offset by a sharp rise in construction costs. For example, the 
increase in material and labour costs in the construction sector was particularly strong 
during this period, even compared with the costs relevant to other gross fixed capital 
formation. This can be seen in the gap between real and nominal construction 
investment growth (see Chart 3.14). The sharp rise in prices kept nominal construction 
investment at a relatively high level until 2023, which was reflected in the nominal loan 
volumes demanded by the sector. As a result, the volume of loans to the construction 
and real estate sector fell less sharply than in other sectors of the economy.   23) 
 24) 
23 In this article, the construction and real estate sector refers to the following economic sectors: construction, 
housing enterprises and other real estate activities.
24 The slower decline in lending to the construction and real estate sector also supported developments in 
other loan sub-categories. For example, the lending business of savings banks and credit unions benefited 
from the fact that they traditionally have a strong presence in this business segment. At the same time, its 
business structure means that the construction and real estate sector is predominantly funded over the long 
term. This contributed to long-term lending declining less sharply during the period of interest rate tightening 
than in the shorter segments.

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 865 Conclusion and outlook
Despite the interest rate reversal, loan growth accelerated in 2022 due to 
government aid loans to energy suppliers and other one-off factors.  Although 
monetary policy responded to the inflationary surge with substantial tightening, 
lending to non-financial corporations initially continued to pick up strongly until 
October 2022. One key factor was the government support loans granted to selected 
energy suppliers in 2022 as a result of Russia’s war against Ukraine. In addition, the 
sharp rise in input and storage costs in 2022 increased the need for short-term funding 
across the corporate sector. Further positive impulses came in the aftermath of fiscal 
and monetary policy support measures from the coronavirus pandemic. 
In line with the deteriorated economic environment and the monetary policy-
induced rise in interest rates, the downturn in net lending began at the end of 2022.  
Model-based analyses indicate that the decline in loan supply and loan demand was 
mainly due to the adverse macro environment and was generally consistent with 
historical patterns. In particular, persistently weak private investment and high funding 
costs were the main factors behind the weakening of loan demand. Other factors were 
the – on aggregate – sufficient supply of internal financing in the corporate sector and 
heightened uncertainty with regard to potential geopolitical conflicts and how 
structural problems are dealt with in Germany, which dampened firms’ willingness to 
invest. The significant tightening of lending conditions can be explained by the rapid 
and strong rise in interest rates and the cyclically induced increase in credit risk on the 
corporate side. The German banking system remains in a stable state. Model results 
also provide no evidence of a significant reduction in the supply of loans beyond the 
impact of the adverse macro environment due to bank-related factors affecting cost of 
funds and bank-related balance sheet constraints. 
A gradual rebound in lending is expected over the course of this year.  In recent 
months, banks’ net lending to firms has largely stagnated. New lending business, i.e. 
newly concluded loan agreements, excluding redemptions, recently saw slightly 
stronger lending. The banks surveyed in the  observed – for the first time since BLS
2022 – an increase in demand for loans to enterprises in the second quarter of 2024, 
which they expect to continue in the third quarter. Our current forecast for loans to 
enterprises also expects a recovery starting from the second half of 2024; however, the 
projected increase in the annual growth rate is slow (see the supplementary 
).  information on loan forecasts

Developments in loans to enterprises in Germany since the start of the monetary policy 
tightening cycle
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 87The projected gradual increase in lending is based on the assumption of a gradual 
improvement in the macro environment.  After around two years of economic 
weakness, the German economy is slowly regaining momentum.  The expected 
increase in foreign demand should stimulate the export industry. Private consumption 
is likely to recover. In addition, the current Forecast for Germany is based on the 
assumption that a gradual reversal of interest rate hikes will have a positive impact on 
firms’ financing environment. Nevertheless, tangible growth impulses from private 
investment are not expected until 2026. It is therefore to be assumed that net lending 
will only rise again slowly. In addition, the currently elevated uncertainty amongst 
enterprises with regard to future underlying economic conditions and structural 
change is likely to persist for the time being. 
Empirical analyses suggest that demand for loans will not rise immediately as the 
economy improves.  In the past, loan growth mostly lagged behind  growth and GDP
investment by between two and six quarters.  This lag can be explained by the role of 
internal financing: in the economic upturn, enterprises can initially cover their funding 
needs from internally generated funds. Therefore, there is often a delay before they 
begin to apply for loans. As German enterprises still have significant internal financing  
resources on aggregate, loan growth is likely to pick up only gradually, even in the 
economic upswing.
The robust financial situation in the German banking sector currently does not 
suggest that major bank-related restrictions will dampen the recovery in lending.  
Should the economic environment brighten up, this would also have a positive impact 
on future credit risk developments. Credit risks currently appear to be significant only 
in certain areas of commercial real estate financing. In addition, according to financial 
accounts data, the German corporate sector’s debt situation can still be assessed as 
sound. A falling interest rate level would gradually improve the credit risk situation in 
commercial real estate in particular.  25)

Loan forecasts
Forecasts of future loan developments
In order to allow a broader assessment of lending dynamics, the Bundesbank 
regularly conducts loan forecasts for the coming quarters.  These forecasts are based 
on two different variants of a parsimonious Bayesian vector autoregressive  ( ) BVAR
model in levels using the approach in Giannone et al. (2015)  and focusing on forecast 
performance. In addition to loans to non-financial corporations, the first model variant 
includes the investment ratio (defined as the ratio of private fixed investment to  ), GDP
the yield spread between long-term corporate and government bonds, and the long-
term interest rate on loans to enterprises. The second model variant additionally 
includes the cumulative  standards in the model.  The  is specified with four BLS BVAR
lags. Both the selection of the model variables and the determination of the lag 
structure were carried out using a forecast evaluation. 
The model parameters are estimated up to the available data end, currently the 
first quarter of 2024.  Forecasts are then conducted for the following quarters for each 
point in time. These are based on the Bundesbank’s forecast of economic activity in 
Germany, which is published every June and December.  All projections in this article 
are made using data available on 21 May 2024. Chart 3.15 shows the loan forecasts 
based on these data. The grey and blue paths represent the two model variants used 
here, with and without taking account of  standards. Both estimation variants BLS
suggest a slow recovery in lending dynamics from the second half of 2024 onwards. 
However, the projected increase in loan growth is gradual, with annual growth rates 
ranging from 2 % to 3 % for medium forecast horizons (in 2025). At the same time, the 
very broad uncertainty bands in some cases reflect the considerable uncertainty 
associated with the forecasts. Overall, however, they are in line with current 
expectations regarding the economic outlook.  [1]

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 89Forecast of hypothetical loan developments
The forecasting model can also be used for hypothetical simulations, i.e. for 
simulations of loan developments derived from model relationships.  Chapter 2  of 
the main article compares the loan growth observed since the beginning of 2022 with 
hypothetical loan developments calculated on the basis of the variant of the forecasting 
model which also includes  standards. To this end, the model described above is BLS
estimated for the period from the beginning of 1991 to the end of 2021. For the period 
from the beginning of 2022, loan developments are then forecast based on historical 
relationships between the model variables and the actual development of the 
explanatory variables up to the current data end. The forecasts are therefore 
conditional on the realisations of the investment ratio, the yield spread, the lending 
rate and the  standards. In order to show the uncertainty associated with the BLS
forecast, the uncertainty band (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) is shown alongside the 
median.
This reveals that actual loan growth over the period under review was broadly in 
line with the model forecast, although there were some deviations in individual 
quarters.  In Chart 3.2 in , the black line represents actual credit growth. The Chapter 2
blue line shows the median distribution of the conditional forecasts.  The shaded area

uncertainty associated with the forecasts. The grey line represents the loan growth rate 
adjusted for  aid loans.  As these loans were very large in volume and mostly had KfW
fairly short terms, they temporarily led to the fairly large ups and downs in actual 
lending. As a short-term government support measure, they were exogenous in nature 
and thus represented a one-off effect on lending. Adjusted for this one-off effect, loan 
growth remained within the uncertainty band throughout the simulation period and 
was therefore compatible with the model relationships prevailing before 2022. 
For a description of the approach, see Giannone et al. (2015).
The data for the  credit standards are only available from the fourth quarter of 2002. In order to allow a BLS
longer estimation period from 1991 onwards, the  standards are extended backwards using BLS
information on firm insolvencies, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022b). 
See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b). For the calculation of conditional forecasts, see Bańbura et al. (2015).
See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b).
To better illustrate this, the forecasts of loan levels are then converted into annual growth rates.

Analysis of loans to non-financial corporations in 
Germany using a macro-financial Bayesian  model VAR
 
Comparing the distribution of the conditional simulation with actual loan growth 
provides indications as to whether loan growth has deviated noticeably during the 
simulation period from the estimated relationships in the model.  In addition to the 
actual annual growth rate of loans to enterprises, Chart 3.16 also shows selected 
percentiles of the probability distribution of conditional simulations of the loan growth 
rate, starting in the first quarter of 2022. These simulations are based on the model 
parameters estimated for the period from the beginning of 1999 to the end of 2021 
and are conditional on actual developments in real  and  in Germany and the GDP HICP
rest of the euro area, government bond yields and the monetary policy indicator up to 
the end of the first quarter of 2024.  
At the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, loan growth does not deviate much 
from the simulations after having exceeded them markedly in 2022.  Actual loan 
growth clearly exceeds the simulation from the second to the fourth quarter of 2022 
and then drops to the lower end of the simulated distribution.  In the last two 
quarters, it is close to the 25th percentile of the simulated distribution. Both the Developments in loans to non-financial corporations in Germany are investigated 
using a vector autoregressive (VAR) model that describes the interaction of a 
number of real economic and financial variables.  The model contains quarterly 
observations of ten variables: it comprises real gross domestic product (GDP ) in 
Germany and the rest of the euro area, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  
(HICP ) in Germany and the rest of the euro area, loans to non-financial corporations in 
Germany, the lending rate (new business), the German contribution to M3, and the 
yield on German government bonds with a residual maturity of five years. In order to 
capture both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures, the shadow 
interest rate of Geiger and Schupp (2018) is used as monetary policy indicator and 
extended into the past or present with the interest rate on overnight loans in the 
interbank market (EONIA  or €STR ). To control for possible spillover effects from US 
monetary policy, the model also contains the yields of US Treasuries with a residual 
maturity of five years. [1] All variables enter the model with five lags, interest rates as 
decimal numbers, and the other variables in log levels. [2]

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 93upward and downward deviation can be partly attributed to ’s special loans and KfW
their subsequent repayment. According to the analysis, the dynamics of loans to 
enterprises in Germany do not appear unusual overall conditional on the 
macroeconomic environment.   
Identifying structural economic shocks allows the fluctuations in loan growth to be 
decomposed into their economically interpretable determinants.  Comparing the 
actual loan growth rate with the conditional simulations does not allow direct 
conclusions to be made as to which economic determinants cause observed deviations, 
as the simulations are based on the reduced form of the  model. Fluctuations in VAR
loans to enterprises around their long-term trend are the result of structural shocks 
that can be interpreted economically. These are contained as linear combinations in the 
residuals of the  model and can be identified using additional assumptions. In the VAR
present analysis, identification is based on sign restrictions, i.e. on theoretically 
substantiated assumptions about the sign with which certain variables react to 
structural shocks.  Five structural shocks are identified: an aggregate demand shock, 
an aggregate supply shock, a loan supply shock, a monetary policy shock and a money 
demand shock. The identification assumptions are based on those in Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2023b) and are summarised in Table 3.1. The analysis takes into account 
the fact that the Eurosystem’s monetary policy responds to economic developments in 
the euro area as a whole and not only in Germany. In order to sufficiently capture the 
Eurosystem’s monetary policy response function, the model includes real  and the GDP
 not only of Germany but also of the rest of the euro area.  When identifying the HICP
monetary policy shock, it is assumed that, following an increase in the monetary policy 
interest rate, real  and  will fall not only in Germany but also in the rest of the GDP HICP
euro area.  For the other shocks, the variables for the rest of the euro area are not 
subject to any restrictions. Whether or not the other shocks are specific to Germany or 
impact the euro area as a whole thus remains undetermined by the analysis. For this 
analysis, the estimation period is extended until the first quarter of 2024.
The model attributes the acceleration of loan growth from the end of 2021 and its 
subsequent decline to the impact of aggregate demand shocks and monetary policy 
shocks.  Chart 3.17 shows the decomposition of the deviations of the loan growth rate 
from a hypothetical scenario in which no shocks would have occurred from 2019 
onwards into the contributions of the identified structural shocks. “Other” summarises 
the contributions of the remaining five unidentified and thus uninterpretable shocks.  
In the phase of accelerating loan growth from mid-2021 onwards, loan growth is 
positively impacted by aggregate demand shocks and expansionary monetary policy 
shocks.  According to the analysis, the decline in loan growth from mid-2022 
onwards is partly due to the expiry of the supportive effect of these shocks. The results 
do not provide any evidence to suggest that loan supply shocks have a significant role 
in loan growth over the period under review. Unlike the results for the euro area in [5]

11.  The model is broadly similar to that used in Deutsche Bundesbank (2020), but additionally contains the 
German contribution to  to allow a comparison of the role of money demand shocks during the M3 - COVID
19 pandemic with the results for the euro area in Deutsche Bundesbank (2023a).
The estimation is conducted using the Bayesian approach of Giannone et al. (2015). Modelling of the 
increased variance during the 19 pandemic follows Lenza and Primiceri (2022).- COVID
The simulation approach follows Bańbura et al. (2015).
Compared with the simulation in Chart 3.2, the distribution of the simulations is wider, especially towards 
the end of the simulation period. This is due, amongst other factors, to the increased estimation 
uncertainty associated with the larger number of variables.
However, episodes with relatively high inflation rates, as in the simulation period, play only a comparatively 
small role in the estimation period. This could lead to the model not correctly reflecting the relationships 
between the variables in a regime with elevated inflation rates and a significant role of supply-side shocks.
See Arias et al. (2018).
See Mandler and Scharnagl (2020).
It is also assumed that the coefficients of  and  are positive in the monetary policy indicator GDP HICP
equation, i.e. that the Eurosystem responds to an increase in  or the price level with a more restrictive GDP
monetary policy. See Arias et al. (2019).
The analysis provides statistical distributions of the contributions of the shocks and the deviation of the 
actual loan growth rate from the hypothetical model simulation without shocks (unconditional forecast). 
The chart represents the median of each of these distributions. A difference between the black line, the 
median of the difference in the unconditional forecast and the sum of the median contributions of the 
shocks can be explained by the fact that the median of a sum is not necessarily equal to the sum of the 
medians of the summands.
The estimated model equation for the monetary policy indicator would have required a much more 
expansionary monetary policy in response to the sharp decline in  during the 19 pandemic in GDP - COVID
the first quarter of 2020 than was actually the case. A monetary policy easing as predicted by the model 
would probably not have been feasible at all, owing to the effective lower bound and limits on potential 
monetary policy purchase programmes. The model therefore diagnoses a restrictive monetary policy shock 
at this point in time, followed by a somewhat less pronounced expansionary monetary policy shock in the 
second quarter, when  partially recovered. In the shock decomposition, the effect of the first, GDP
restrictive monetary policy shock prevails throughout 2020. For more information, see footnote 35 in 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2023a).
This also applies to the decomposition of the other variables, in particular  By contrast, the results .M3
pertaining to the role of aggregate demand shocks and monetary policy shocks are similar to those for the 
euro area in Deutsche Bundesbank (2023a).

The quantitative importance of loan supply and loan 
demand for loan growth
A model-based analysis is necessary in order to identify loan supply and demand as 
drivers of loan growth.  The approach described below merges information on the 
dynamics of loan volumes from the balance sheet statistics of the monetary financial 
institutions  with data on average interest rates for (new) loans from the  ( ) MFIs MFI
interest rate statistics as well as with  data.  The analysis also takes into account BLS
the macroeconomic environment (including monetary policy), which has a bearing on 
developments in the loan market. This model can be used to show the observed annual 
growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations as the sum of all unexpected 
changes in loan supply and demand in the past – i.e. shocks – as well as the 
development of exogenous variables and an unidentified residual component. Unlike in 
the , this supplementary information on the macro-financial Bayesian  modelVAR
approach specifically aims to map the unexpected changes in loan growth to one of the 
two sides of the market. 
The VAR model presented here focuses on the relationships between loan growth, 
the lending rate, the change in credit standards according to the BLS (BLS 
standards) and the change in loan demand according to the BLS (BLS demand).  It 
also takes into account the effects of various exogenous variables, namely the rates of 
change in gross domestic product and the consumer price index, as well as a short-
term money market rate (three-month  These variables capture the effects of ). EURIBOR
the macroeconomic environment on the loan market. These effects can influence the 
identification of unexpected changes in loan supply and demand, which means that 
they should be excluded as far as possible from a model that is, nonetheless, 
parsimoniously parametrised. The coefficients and residuals are estimated using the 
ordinary least squares  method over the period from the first quarter of 2003 to ( )OLS
the first quarter of 2024.
The residuals of the loan growth equation are decomposed into supply and demand 
effects as well as into an unidentified remainder component.  This is done by defining 
a combination of zero and sign restrictions that parts of the residuals must meet in 
order to be attributed to the shock in question; see Table 3.2. The restrictions reflect 
the definition of loan supply and demand, supplemented by the assumed response of [1]

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 99the BLS variables. As a case in point, a tightening of the BLS standards is identified as a 
loan supply shock only if it exceeds the level expected according to the model and 
coincides with an unexpected decline in loan growth and a rise in the lending rate.  
The four endogenous variables of the model can now be represented as a linear 
combination of all shocks that occurred up to the respective point in time and 
exogenous influences; see Chart 3.18. “Macroeconomic environment” refers here to the 
universe of exogenous effects. These include the contribution made by government 
assistance loans to energy suppliers in 2022, which initially biased aggregated loan 
growth upwards and then, at end-2023/early 2024, downwards. The contribution of the 
unidentified shocks shown in the chart reflects the effects of the residual components 
that do not correspond to the schema described above.   
According to the model decomposition, after the peak economic impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic, both the increase in loan growth up to mid-2022 and the 
subsequent decline were mainly driven by the macroeconomic environment, which, 
in the specification chosen, also includes monetary policy.  In addition, unexpected 
changes in loan growth mainly reflect particularly weak loan demand. This weakness is 
likely to have been driven in part by factors that cannot be adequately factored into this 
small model. They include, amongst other things, the repayment of loans taken out by 
firms during the pandemic to bridge delays in incoming payments or for precautionary 
reasons. However, firms’ uncertainty about the longer-term consequences of the war in 
Ukraine, particularly regarding energy prices, is also likely to have contributed to the 
relatively persistent dampening effect on loan demand. 
Unexpected loan supply restrictions on loans to enterprises cannot be identified for 
Germany.  According to the model results, loan supply shocks supported loan growth, 
especially during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic. The contribution of loan 
supply shocks is also positive rather than negative for the subsequent phase of initially 
rising and subsequently falling inflation rates, even though the positive contributions 
shown in the chart are not statistically significant throughout. The decomposition for 
the period considered here does not provide any evidence of significant dampening 
loan supply effects, which would have been caused, for example, by bank-related 
factors.

The modelling follows the procedure outlined in Deutsche Bundesbank (2023h).
For the estimation, loan growth was adjusted for the contribution of  loans to non-financial KfW
corporations in Germany, as these represent a distorting one-off effect starting from the second half of 
2022, in the wake of the energy crisis. In addition, the peak economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic 
in 2020 was excluded by disregarding the five observations from the first quarter of 2020 to the first 
quarter of 2021 when calculating the coefficient estimators and the covariance matrix; see Schorfheide and 
Song (2021).

104The EU banking package

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 105 legislators have adopted a new legislative package to strengthen banking EU
regulation. Published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 19 June 2024, this 
package is made up of the revised Capital Requirements Regulation  and the ( )CRR
revised Capital Requirements Directive  and largely comprises the final elements ( ), CRD
of the global Basel III standards. It is sometimes referred to as the banking package or 
 III/  VI.  CRR CRD
The bulk of the Basel III standards from 2010 have already been implemented in the EU. 
These have increased financial stability, strengthened banks’ resilience and laid the 
foundations for the stable financing of the real economy. The final elements now 
complete the Basel framework by adjusting the methodology used in the calculation of 
capital requirements.  
Besides implementing global standards, the banking package contains a number of 
other new features. One is that it incorporates environmental, social and governance  
(ESG) risks into banking regulation. Furthermore, it lays down clear rules for third-  
country banks operating in the EU, strengthens banking supervision, and tightens 
governance requirements.  
The new regulations contained in the  are directly applicable and must be complied CRR
with by banks in the  as of 1 January 2025. The amended  first has to be EU CRD
transposed into national law and is applicable as of 11 January 2026. Implementation 
work has been underway in Germany since the end of 2023.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 1061 Introduction 
The banking package, as it is known, was published in the Official Journal of the 
European Union on 19 June 2024 and entered into force 20 days later.  It is made up 
of the revised Capital Requirements Regulation  and the revised Capital ( )CRR
Requirements Directive  As of 1 January 2025, banks in the  will have to ( ). CRD EU
comply with the new  (  III) rules. The revised  (  VI), meanwhile, first has CRR CRR CRD CRD
to be transposed into national law and is applicable as of 11 January 2026.
The main topic covered by the banking package is the implementation of the 
finalised Basel III standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision ( ) BCBS  in December 2017.  These finalised standards form part of a 
package of measures addressing the weaknesses in the banking system that came to 
light during the 2007‑09 financial crisis. The ’s first action came in 2010, when it BCBS
laid down stricter capital rules (definition of capital, capital ratios, introduction of 
buffers), agreed on uniform liquidity standards and introduced a leverage ratio.  
These standards were implemented into  law back in 2013.  The second package EU
of measures, from 2017, aimed to reduce unwarranted variability in  calculations RWA
across banks. 
To achieve this goal, the standardised approaches used to calculate RWAs  were 
revised and the scope given to individual banks to use their own internal model 
approaches was curtailed.  These measures are complemented by the introduction of 
an output floor requirement for the calculation of . This limits banks further in the RWAs
extent to which they can model their own risks and capital requirements. 1)

January 2021 to comply with a higher leverage ratio. This measure likewise forms part of the finalised Basel III 
standards. Its implementation was brought forward, however.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 107Besides implementing the finalised Basel III standards, the banking package 
contains other measures that can be regarded as a response to political challenges 
of the current era.  These include the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the  (Brexit) EU
as well the adoption of the European Commission’s Strategy for Financing the 
Transition to a Sustainable Economy.  In response to Brexit,  legislators decided to EU
subject banks established outside the  to more harmonised and, in some parts, EU
stricter supervision and regulatory treatment. Financing the transition to a sustainable 
economy is to be achieved, in part, by banks actively managing their sustainability  ( )ESG
risks and this being monitored by the supervisory authorities. 
The individual components of the banking package are presented below. Part one 
discusses new legislation that originated from implementation of the finalised 
Basel III standards.  Part two then presents the measures adopted in the context of 
political circumstances and issues of global relevance (such as climate change).

2.1 Standardised approach for credit risk 
The standardised approach for credit risk (-SACR) is a methodology used for 
calculating the minimum capital requirements for credit risk in a bank’s banking 
book, with the minimum capital requirements being determined based on 
prudential requirements.  The revised  introduced more granular risk weights as -SACR
a way of making the standard more risk-sensitive overall. Furthermore, the calibration 
was adjusted to the losses experienced during the financial crisis years, and efforts 
were made to achieve greater consistency with internal model approaches. One reason 
why this is important is that banks that use the internal ratings-based  approach to ()IRB
calculate their minimum capital requirements for credit risk in the banking book will 
also be required, going forward, to use the  to determine the  output floor -SACR RWA
(see the section entitled “ ”). Another Output floor: lower limit for capital requirements
reason for updating the  is to reduce the reliance on external ratings, or to -SACR
ensure that banks perform due diligence upfront to ensure the appropriateness of 
those ratings. 

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 109The manner in which capital requirements for interbank exposures are determined 
will change in terms of the importance and use of external ratings.  Two techniques 
will be available for calculating these capital requirements: the External Credit Risk 
Assessment  approach and the Standardised Credit Risk Assessment  ( ) ECRA ( ) SCRA
approach. As part of the implementation of the finalised Basel III standards,  EU
legislators agreed to continue to permit the use of external ratings provided these do 
not incorporate assumptions of government support. This measure aims to mitigate 
the nexus between banks and sovereigns and send the appropriate signal to market 
participants.  The  is intended for exposures without an external rating. Under SCRA
this approach, the lending bank, with due regard for the prudential capital metrics and 
having performed due diligence, is required to assign the obligor bank to one of three 
risk weight buckets (grades), which indicates the appropriate risk weight to be applied. 
The risk weights used here range from 40 % (grade A) to 150 % (grade C). A risk weight 
of 30 % is also possible, subject to certain conditions (i.e. the leverage ratio meets or 
exceeds 5 % and the  ratio meets or exceeds 14 %). CET1

7 The option to determine the risk weight of an unrated exposure based on the external rating applicable to the 
central government of the country in which the borrowing bank is established has been deleted.
8 Capital requirements for public borrowers, i.e. central governments, regional governments, local authorities 
and public sector entities, have not been changed, however. It therefore remains possible to assign a zero 
weighting to these exposures.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 110The option of using external ratings has been retained in the corporate exposure 
class as well. Risk weights will be made more risk-sensitive.  As hitherto, a flat 100 % 
risk weight will be assigned in the absence of an external rating. Specialised lending 
exposures are subdivided into three subcategories: object finance, project finance, and 
commodity finance. If certain conditions are met, unrated project finance exposures 
and, on a transitional basis, unrated object finance exposures as well, can be given 
privileged treatment.   legislators likewise decided to leave the supporting factor EU
for small and medium-sized enterprises (the “  SF”), which already exists in the  SME ,EU
unchanged.  The new 85 % risk weight envisaged in the Basel standards for  SMEs
that cannot be assigned to the retail exposure class was not (additionally) 
implemented. 
Subordinated debt and equity exposures will be grouped in separate exposure 
classes.  The risk weights have been increased to take into account the greater risk of 
loss compared with senior loan exposures. In future, risk weights can be as high as 
400 % for certain exposures (speculative equity exposures, for example).  III CRR
grandfathers what it calls strategic equity holdings – that is to say, equity investments 
that a bank has already been holding for at least six years and over which it can 
exercise a certain degree of control and influence continue to be exempt from the 
adjustment of risk weights. Furthermore, exemptions (still) apply to equity exposures to 
institutions covered by the same institutional protection scheme.  In general, 
subordinated debt exposures will receive a risk weight of 150 %. 
In the retail exposure class,  a distinction will be made in future between normal 
exposures used to finance a retail customer and revolving exposures that result 
from payment transactions (such as credit card payments).  The latter are assigned a  
more favourable risk weight of 45 % (instead of 75 %) if the banks can demonstrate 
regular repayments and thus a lower risk of loss. 
Far-reaching changes will be made concerning real estate exposures. Overall, this 
exposure class will be rendered more granular, thus making the capital 
requirement more risk-sensitive.  In the first step, a distinction is made between 
exposures secured by a residential property and those where a commercial property is  9)

10 In these cases, the risk weight is 80 % instead of 100 % or 130 %. The privileged treatment of object finance 
exposures represents a deviation from the Basel standard.
11 The SME SF applies to banks that use the IRB and SA-CR approaches. The risk weights for SME corporate 
exposures can be multiplied by a factor of 0.7625 up to an amount of € 1.5 million and by a factor of 0.85 for 
amounts of € 1.5 million and above.
12 The risk weight for these exposures remains at 100 % and has not been raised.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 111used as collateral. In the second step, banks are required to assess whether the 
mortgage loan can be repaid out of the borrower’s income (“classic” real estate 
exposure) or whether repayment is materially dependent on cash flows generated by 
the property (for example, rental income).  III continues to permit the use of the CRR
loan-splitting approach to calculate the capital requirement for “classic” real estate 
exposures. In this approach, the exposure is divided into a secured portion (loan-to-
value ratio  of up to 55 %) and an unsecured portion  above 55 %). The secured ( )LTV (LTV
portion is assigned a flat risk weight of 20 % (secured by a residential property) or 60 % 
(secured by a commercial property), while the unsecured portion is assigned the 
obligor’s risk weight (for example, 75 % for a retail obligor in a residential property 
exposure). The weighted average of the two portions is then the risk weight of the 
entire exposure. In future, exposures where repayment depends materially on the cash 
flows generated by the property will be subject to higher capital requirements because 
experience has shown that these have a higher risk of loss given default   III ( ). LGD CRR
introduces a new procedure for determining the risk weights for these exposures (the 
“whole loan” approach). This provides for individual ranges to which the total claim is 
assigned depending on the loan-to-value ratio. The higher the  the higher the risk ,LTV
weights and thus the higher the capital requirements. Real estate exposures of this 
kind may, however, be subject to the same rules as “classic” real estate exposures if the 
national loss rates from real estate lending overall do not exceed certain ceilings, based 
on what is known as the hard test. The national competent authority (in Germany, the 
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority  conducts hard tests annually to assess ( )) BaFin
whether this condition has been met. In addition,  III introduces a third category of CRR
mortgage loans. This category contains loans to companies and special-purpose 
vehicles ( ) financing land acquisition, development and construction ( ) SPVs ADC
exposures.  exposures are normally risk-weighted at 150 %, regardless of the ADC
obligor’s creditworthiness. If certain conditions are met,  exposures to residential ADC
properties may be risk-weighted at 100 %.  
Moreover, CRR III amends the definition of “value” for immovable property 
collateral and eliminates the distinction between market value and mortgage 
lending value.  Banks have to ensure that the value of a property is not based on 
possible future price increases, but is sustainable in the long term. This measure is 
intended to help ensure that the value of the collateral contains no speculative 
elements.  legislators did, however, decide that, subject to certain conditions, EU 14)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 112increases in the value of immovable property would be permitted during the life of a 
loan, as long as these do not exceed the average value measured over the previous 
years.
Another new measure is the introduction of a risk weight multiplier for unhedged 
foreign currency exposures.  These are exposures denominated in a currency which is 
different from the currency of the obligor’s source of income. This risk weight multiplier 
is applicable to exposures to natural persons assigned to the retail and residential real 
estate exposure classes. The idea behind it is to cover the risk of default that could arise 
if the currency in which the loan is denominated appreciates significantly. 
Off-balance-sheet items will also be affected by changes to the SA-CR . These changes 
will affect unconditionally cancellable commitments ( ), for example. In future, 10 % UCCs
of the committed but undrawn amount of such commitments will be recognised as an 
exposure and have to be backed by capital. Exempting these exposures from the 
capital requirement has proven unwarranted in practice. Unlike the Basel standard, 
however,  III allows this arrangement to be phased in up until the end of 2032. CRR
The supervisory haircuts applied when counting financial collateral have also been 
updated to reflect newer market data and will have to be applied in future by all  
SA-CR banks that use the financial collateral comprehensive method.  Institutions are 
no longer permitted to use their own haircut estimates as part of the financial collateral 
comprehensive method.  
2.2 Internal ratings-based  approach ( )IRB
Banks that have received supervisory approval to use the IRB approach may 
estimate some of the parameters for calculating capital requirements for credit risk 
themselves.  There are two different methods: the foundation  approach (F- ) and IRB IRB
the advanced  approach (A- ). Banks using the F-  approach are allowed to IRB IRB IRB
provide their own estimates of the probability of default  while the other risk (),PD
parameters are specified by supervisors. Under the A-  approach, banks also provide IRB
their own estimates of loss given default  and the credit conversion factor ( ) ( ) LGD CCF
for off-balance-sheet exposures. 15) 
15 The horizon for calculating this average value is six years for residential property and eight years for 
commercial immovable property.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 113CRR III contains some changes aimed at limiting the unwanted variability in RWA  
calculations.  The  had found that banks were arriving at different results when BCBS
determining capital requirements for the same risks,  resulting in a lack of 
transparency and comparability of capital requirements. This could be because of 
insufficient data for estimating the parameters or overly aggressive modelling. 
To address this, the scope of application was adjusted and parameter estimates 
were limited, making the foundation IRB approach and -SACR more meaningful.  In 
future, it will not be permitted to use either the foundation or the advanced  IRB
approach to calculate the capital requirements for equity exposures. These must then 
be treated using the . Under  III, portfolios in types of exposures that exhibit -SACR CRR
only low levels of default over time (“low-default portfolios”) may only be treated using 
the foundation  approach. These include exposures to large corporates (i.e. with IRB
annual sales of more than € 500 million) and to banks and financial sector entities. The 
reason given for this measure is that reliable estimates of  are only possible when LGD
there is sufficient data on defaults. A separate exposure class is introduced for 
exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities. The 
advanced  approach is still permitted for these. Exposures in the retail, specialised IRB

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 114lending, and central governments and central banks exposure classes can likewise 
continue to be treated using the advanced  approach. However, input floors will IRB
apply in future for the risk parameters. This measure is intended to prevent capital 
requirements falling below a certain level and risks being underestimated. However, 
this comes at the price of reduced risk sensitivity and an incentive for banks to 
potentially take on greater risks given the same capital requirements.  legislators EU
have adopted the minimum values set by the  Going forward, the existing input . BCBS
floor for  of 0.03 % will go up to 0.05 %.  The input floors for the credit conversion PD
factors are based on the regulatory values applied in the . They have to be at least -SACR
50 % of these values. When calculating the input floors for  a distinction must be , LGD
made between secured and unsecured exposures. The values are based on the 
exposure class for unsecured exposures, and on the type of collateral for secured 
exposures.  
The regulatory LGD  and conversion factor values in the foundation IRB approach 
have also been adjusted, which will result in slightly reduced capital requirements 
in future.  Other changes relate to the scaling factor of 1.06 previously contained in the 
risk weight function. This no longer applies in  III, meaning that the capital CRR
requirements will be around 6 % lower in future, all other things being equal.
Upon application of CRR III, banks will also be allowed to decide anew which 
exposure classes to use the IRB approach for and which to use the -SACR for.  
Previously, the  approach had to be “rolled out” to all exposure classes subject to IRB
supervisory approval. There were only exemptions for certain exposures (“partial use”). 
Partial use rules are still in place but will relate in future to the individual exposure 
classes for which banks have received approval to use the  approach. In addition to IRB

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 1152.3 Operational risk
There are currently three approaches to calculating capital requirements for 
operational risk.  Two of these, the basic indicator approach and the standardised 
approach, are standardised procedures that use the credit institution's average gross 
income over the past three years as the basis for the calculation. Multiplying this 
average income by a regulatory percentage yields the capital requirements. The third 
approach, the advanced measurement approach  is an internal method that ( ), AMA
allows institutions to use their own estimates and assumptions. As regulation was 
reviewed in the wake of the financial crisis, however, it became clear that gross income 
was not a suitable indicator of a bank’s operational risk. The  also found BCBS
that – much like with credit risk – there are large differences in the calculation of . RWAs
This is because no uniform methodology for applying the  has become established AMA
among banks and supervisors. In addition, there were doubts as to whether an internal 
method, in the sense of greater risk sensitivity in this area, could create real added 
value. 
As a result, the BCBS  agreed to completely overhaul the calculation of the capital 
requirements.  The three previous approaches were replaced by a new standardised 
measurement approach  While the  is similar to the basic indicator approach ( ). SMA SMA
in how the calculations are made, it does not use gross income but something called 
the business indicator (BI) as the relevant variable. This is made up of three 
components: 
Interest, leases and dividend component: net interest income including income 
from leases and dividends;
Services component: maximum of fee and commission income and fee and 
commission expense as well as maximum of other operating income and other 
operating expenses;
Financial component: net profit and loss on the trading book and the banking 
book.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 116Also new in the revised framework is that positive values of all components feed 
into the calculation.  This means that a negative net trading result, for example, also 
increases the basis for the calculation. Another new rule is that banks are divided into 
three categories according to their size. Larger banks are assumed to be exposed to 
higher levels of operational risk, and therefore also have to apply a higher percentage 
to calculate their capital requirements (18 % instead of the 12 % used by smaller banks). 
Finally, the calculation also includes a loss component, the internal loss multiplier ( ). ILM
This is intended to further increase risk sensitivity and at the same time to give banks a 
stronger incentive to avoid operational risk. If a bank’s losses are higher than average 
over the long term, the capital requirements increase. If they are lower than average, 
the capital requirements can be reduced by up to just under one-half.
EU legislators have incorporated the , SMA  as adopted by the , BCBS  into CRR III. 
Since the  left its members free to choose whether or not to include the loss BCBS
component and because, during the negotiations on  III, the dominant view was CRR
that historical operational losses are not a reliable basis on which to estimate future 
losses, the loss component was not implemented. However, large banks in the  are EU
required to record their operational losses and report them to supervisors. 
2.4 Credit valuation adjustment  risk and market risk ( )CVA
measurement approaches
CVA risk arises when the counterparty’s credit quality is jeopardised and its 
creditworthiness may deteriorate.  This risk assessment focuses on over-the-counter  
(OTC ) derivatives. These harbour not only market risk, but also credit risk. If, for 
example, the credit quality of the derivative counterparty worsens, this negatively 


The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 117affects the value of the derivative. The higher the price of the derivative, the greater the 
absolute loss in value. In order to measure this interplay between market risk and 
credit risk, two identical portfolios are considered, with only one assumed to exhibit 
potentially changing credit quality. The resulting difference in value is termed the credit 
valuation adjustment  Banks have to measure their  risk and calculate the ( ).CVA CVA
relevant capital requirements. Aside from a change in counterparty credit quality 
(credit risk),  risk is also caused by a change in the absolute price of the derivative CVA
(market risk) or by a combination of both. 
As banks incurred significant CVA losses during the financial crisis, CVA risk was 
included in the Basel III framework.  In the  therefore, there is already a capital ,EU
requirement for  derivatives. If a materiality threshold is exceeded, capital OTC
requirements for  risk also apply to securities financing transactions ( ). There CVA SFTs
are  exemptions, however. For example, this rule does not apply to  derivatives EU OTC
transacted with  Member States (public sector entities) and non-financial EU
corporations. This derogation is a deviation from the Basel framework.  legislators EU
decided to keep this rule in  III as well. However, in future, banks will have to report CRR
their hypothetical  capital requirements for exempted transactions to supervisors. CVA
The finalised Basel III framework revised the calculation approaches.  As with 
operational risk, regulators decided to no longer allow internal models for calculating 
 requirements. Instead, there will be a new standardised approach  that CVA (-SA )CVA
will lead to more methodological consistency with the Fundamental Review of the 
Trading Book  This approach  corresponds to a variance-covariance ( ). FRTB (-SA )CVA
approach with correlations specified by supervisors and is intended for banks with 
more sophisticated derivatives portfolios. Use of this approach is therefore subject to 
supervisory approval. The new standardised approach also ensures that the market risk 
as well as the credit risk of derivatives are hedged.
In order to take the principle of proportionality into account, two further calculation 
methods are also introduced in CRR III. The basic approach  is a method for (-BA )CVA
calculating  capital requirements that may be used without supervisory approval. It CVA
is much simpler than the standardised approach and uses data already intended for 
calculating counterparty credit risk, which means banks have access to them without 
having to go to any extra effort. However, this approach does not hedge the market 
risk of derivatives.
The third approach is the simplified approach. It is intended for banks that have a 
comparatively small OTC  derivatives portfolio.   III includes a threshold for this, CRR
which also applies for use of the original exposure method for counterparty credit risk 
(threshold for original exposure method: volume of derivatives business does not 
 19) 

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 118exceed 5 % of the institution's total assets and € 100 million).  However, 
implementation of this is stricter than in the Basel standard.  The capital 
requirements for  risk under this approach correspond to the capital requirements CVA
for counterparty credit risk. Supervisors can withdraw approval to use this approach, 
however, if  risk contributes materially to the bank’s overall risk. CVA
As regards market risk measurement approaches, the banking package also 
introduces the simplified standardised approach, the alternative standardised 
approach and the alternative internal model approach for capital purposes.  Among 
the changes from  II,  III introduces new rules on the boundary of the trading CRR CRR
book and the reclassification of positions. Moreover, it also defines requirements for 
internal risk transfers between the non-trading book and the trading book. At the same 
time, the European Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act allowing it to 
delay the entry into force of the market risk rules by up to two years and, initially, to 
adjust the level of the capital requirements.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 1192.5 Output floor: lower limit for capital requirements
The use of internal models to determine RWAs  generally results in lower capital 
requirements than the use of regulatory standardised approaches.  The gap between 
capital requirements is especially pronounced for lower-risk portfolios. In addition, 
when applying internal models of different banks to identical portfolios, there is strong 
dispersion in the resulting capital requirements. This leads to a lack of comparability for 
capital requirements and runs counter to the objective of creating a level playing field 
and an internationally harmonised set of rules. 
Against this backdrop, there are differing views internationally on the benefits of 
using internal models to calculate capital requirements.  While some jurisdictions, 
including the  generally consider their use to be beneficial as they increase risk ,EU
sensitivity, other jurisdictions, including the United States for example, have less 
confidence in banks’ own estimates. This led to lengthy and complicated deliberations 
during the negotiations on finalising the Basel III package. The upshot was that the 
 agreed to continue to permit the use of internal models. However, the maximum BCBS
possible reduction in capital requirements compared with use of the standardised 
approaches was limited. This means that  cannot fall below a certain value when RWAs
using internal models. This threshold is also referred to as the output floor. The output 
floor is measured as a percentage (72.5 %) of  calculated using the standardised RWAs
approaches. Banks that use internal models must therefore additionally calculate  RWAs
using the standardised approaches, multiply them by 72.5 % and, if necessary, increase 
their  to that level if their model-based  and thus the capital requirements RWAs RWAs
are lower. The potential reduction in capital requirements compared with the use of 
standardised approaches is thus capped at 27.5 %. 

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 120EU legislators incorporated this rule into CRR III and CRD  VI. However, there will be 
some idiosyncrasies in the calculation of additional capital add-ons, such as the existing 
capital buffers and Pillar 2 add-ons. In addition to the minimum capital requirement of 
8 % of , there are further capital requirements for banks depending on their RWAs
economic situation (e.g. the systemic risk buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer), 
their size and complexity (e.g. the buffers for other systemically important institutions 
(O- ) and global systemically important institutions (G- )), and their individual risk SIIs SIIs
situation (e.g. Pillar 2 add-on). Some of these add-ons may also address risks arising 
from the use of internal models. This is true of the systemic risk buffer and the Pillar 2 
add-on, for instance. As the risk of potentially insufficient capital requirements based 
on models will already be limited by the output floor in future and a double capital 
requirement should be avoided, these add-ons are initially being reviewed by banking 
supervisors. An automatic increase which would arise from the  increase given a RWA
binding output floor cannot take place until this review. The same applies to the capital 
add-ons for O-  and G- , as an  increase gives the size component a greater SIIs SIIs RWA
weight in the calculation. 
Another idiosyncrasy is the level of application of the RWA  output floor for banking 
groups in the .EU In the  capital requirements also apply at the single entity level. In ,EU
other words, subsidiaries of banking groups must comply with the requirements, just 
the same as the parent institution. Accordingly, the output floor will likewise have to be 
complied with at the single entity level. Going forward, however,  Member States will EU


The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 121be able to decide for themselves whether banking groups within their national borders 
need to comply with the output floor only at the highest level of consolidation. This rule 
will not apply across borders, though, because in a crisis situation a transfer of capital 
across national borders does not seem sufficiently safe.
In addition to these permanent idiosyncrasies in the implementation of the output 
floor, CRR III includes a number of temporary derogations from the Basel standard.  
One is that the output floor will be phased in from 1 January 2025 to 
31 December 2029. It will therefore only come into full force (72.5 %) two years after the 
international implementation deadline. Another is that  III provides for various CRR
reduced requirements for the calculation of  under the standardised approaches. RWAs
However, these only apply to those banks that are required to calculate the output floor.
 They include the following, in particular:
a lower risk weight for certain corporate exposures for which no credit 
assessment by an ECAI  is available under the -SACR (65 % instead of 100 %), for a 
transitional period up to 31 December 2032;
a lower risk weight for certain exposures secured by mortgages on residential 
property (10 % on the secured portion instead of 20 %), for a transitional period 
up to 31 December 2032;
a lower risk weight when calculating capital requirements for counterparty credit 
risk, for a transitional period up to 31 December 2029;
a lower risk weight for certain securitisation positions, for a transitional period up 
to 31 December 2032. 22) 
22 Until the full introduction, the potential RWA increase will additionally be limited to 25 % for banks in 
accordance with the Basel standard.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 1223 Impact of the Basel III finalisation on German 
institutions
Since 2011, the , BCBS  in cooperation with national supervisory authorities, has been 
conducting a comprehensive global data collection initiative to assess the impact of 
the new standards on banks’ capital requirements.  40 German banks are also 
participating in the initiative, primarily larger banks that use the  approach for credit IRB
risk. Once the transitional arrangements stipulated in the legislation come to an end in 
2033, the  implementation of the Basel III finalisation will lead to an increase of EU
around 10.3 %  in capital requirements  in this sample. During the transitional 
period, a large part of this increase will thus be cushioned by the transitional 
arrangements. In 2030, the additional capital requirement will still be only around 
3.1 %. However, as this sample is dominated by larger banks, the results cannot be 
extrapolated one-to-one to the German banking market as a whole. The Bundesbank 
estimates that the total capital requirement of all German banks could rise by around 
2 % in 2030 and by 7 % in 2033. This corresponds to around € 25 billion up to 2033. This 
is manageable for the German banking market, as it is equipped with sufficient capital 
over and above the minimum requirement.    23)   24) 
 25) 
23 The reference date for the data collection is 31 December 2022.
24 Tier 1 capital.
25 Approximately € 160 billion in additional common equity tier 1 capital is available in the German banking 
market.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 123Compared with a strict implementation of the requirements in the Basel III 
finalisation, these effects are significantly smaller.  One-to-one implementation would 
have led to an increase of 18.5 % in minimum requirements in the sample and an 
extrapolated 15 % for the German market as a whole.  
In the ,EU the output floor will be phased in from 2025, starting at 50 %.  Initially, it 
will not be binding for any of the German banks in the sample. The transitional 
arrangements referred to in the  are intended to mitigate section on the output floor
the impact of the output floor on the capital requirement of banks using internal 
models. In particular, the relief for non-externally rated corporate positions is of 
particular importance here. Banks that apply the  will benefit most from -SACR -EU

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 126 
The new -ESG related provisions in CRD  VI can be broken down into two categories: 
new obligations for banks and additional powers for supervisory authorities.  In 
addition, they envisage various new mandates for the  (see Table 4.2).EBA
In future, banks will have to take ESG risks into account in their internal capital 
planning and in their regular strategy review,  considering the short, medium and 
long term. Another new element is the obligation for management bodies to set out 
specific plans outlining the  risks their bank is exposed to and how it will address ESG
them. These also include risks arising from the transition towards a climate-neutral 
economy, such as policy measures that could drive up costs in certain sectors and thus 
increase default risk for the banks financing them. Furthermore, a bank’s remuneration 
rules and practices must be aligned with its  strategy. This applies, in particular, to ESG
the level of variable remuneration.
In line with banks’ new obligations, supervisory authorities can demand a reduction 
in the exposure to ESG risks on a case-by-case basis.  In addition, they can require 
institutions to adjust the targets, measures and actions in the above-mentioned plans.  The changes to the CRR mainly concern disclosure and supervisory reporting.   
The aim is to ensure that supervisory authorities have at their disposal data that are 
sufficiently granular, comprehensive and comparable to ensure effective supervision. 
ESG-related disclosure requirements will be extended to all institutions. Until now, they  
were only applicable to large, publicly traded banks. In addition, the requirements will 
be specified in more detail and expanded. For example, institutions must disclose 
information on ESG risks, distinguishing environmental, social and governance risks, 
and physical risks as well as transition risks for environmental risks.   28)  Moreover, 
banks must disclose how they integrate the identified ESG risks in their business 
strategy and processes, governance and risk management.   
28 Transition risks are defined as risks arising from the transition to a low-emission economy. Physical risks, on 
the other hand, comprise damage resulting from extreme weather events or the gradual change in climate 
(see Deutsche Bundesbank (2023)).

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 1274.2 Crypto-assets
The revised CRR and CRD  introduce provisions on the prudential treatment of 
crypto-asset exposures for the first time.  In December 2022, the  adopted a BCBS
global standard on this subject,  which has now been incorporated into the legislative 
text in the form of transitional arrangements.
Within this framework, crypto-assets are broken down into three groups for the 
purposes of calculating capital requirements.  These are based in part on some of the 
crypto-asset categories introduced by the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( ). MiCAR
 For the riskiest group of crypto-assets, the total permissible holdings are limited to 
1 % of a bank’s tier 1 capital. In addition,  III and  VI contain relevant definitions CRR CRD
and reporting and disclosure requirements, as well as requirements for banks’ risk 
management and supervisory processes. The European Commission has until mid-2025 
to submit a separate legislative proposal addressing the other elements of the Basel 
standard (for example, specific liquidity requirements).
4.3 Harmonised framework for the supervision of third-country 
branches
At present, supervising branches of banks established outside the European 
Economic Area (EEA is largely a national matter.  As a result, national requirements 
for third-country branches range from minimal rules to broadly similar treatment to 
any other (subsidiary) institution. CRD  VI now establishes a single framework for the 
supervision of third-country branches.  The rules of the framework are structured as 
minimum requirements. This means that Member States will be able to impose stricter 
requirements on third-country branches and maintain their existing framework (in 
whole or in part), provided that their national requirements are aligned with those 
applicable to a credit institution as defined in the  As a general rule, a bank .CRR

not be given more favourable treatment than that accorded to EEA institutions.

The EU banking package

principles exist for intra-group transactions both between the third-country institution 
and its branches and among the branches themselves, as well as for interbank 
transactions. Reverse solicitation is also permitted, provided that it is at the own 
exclusive initiative of the client.
4.4 Supervisory powers and fines
Supervisory powers will be expanded in some areas and new notification 
requirements will be introduced.  For example, a bank will be obliged to notify the 
competent authority if it acquires material holdings in financial or non-financial sector 
entities. A holding is considered to be material if it exceeds 15 % of the eligible capital 
of the proposed acquirer. In future, banks and entities defined as (mixed) financial 
holding companies, as well as entities within the same group, will also have to notify 
the competent authority in advance of material transfers of assets and liabilities. In 
addition, the competent authorities must be notified of far-reaching business decisions 
such as mergers or divisions. 
Periodic penalty payments are another new element in the legislation.  The 
competent authorities are now authorised to impose periodic penalty payments per 
day of breach for infringements of rules resulting from the  and  or of decisions CRR CRD
taken by a competent authority on the basis of those rules. This is to ensure that banks 
return to compliance with supervisory requirements as quickly as possible. In future, 
there will be a uniform definition of total annual net turnover, which will be used as the 
basis for calculating the maximum amount of administrative penalties and periodic 
penalty payments that can be imposed on a legal person. The maximum amount for 
periodic penalty payments that can be imposed on a natural person per day of breach 
is € 50,000.  
4.5 Governance
The new rules introduced by CRD  VI will also strengthen the governance 
requirements for banks.  Among other elements, with regard to suitability 
 32) 

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 129assessments they introduce an ex ante suitability notification for “large firms”.  In 
future, large firms will be required to notify the competent authority if they intend to 
appoint members of the management body in its management function or the chair of 
the management body in its supervisory function at least 30 working days before the 
prospective member takes up the position and submit the documents necessary for the 
suitability assessment.
The new legislation introduces a suitability assessment by the competent 
supervisory authorities for the heads of internal control functions  and the chief 
financial officers ( ) CFO  of large institutions.  If supervisors do not consider such 
candidates to be suitable for the position, they have the power to prevent them from 
taking up the position, remove them from the position or require additional measures 
to ensure their suitability. Another important innovation is the inclusion of direct 
reporting lines from the heads of internal control functions to the institution's 
management body in its supervisory function and the requirement that they can be 
removed from their function in the future and with the prior approval of the 
management body in its supervisory function.  32) 
 33) 
32 Large firms are defined as large entities and large subsidiaries, as well as parent financial holding companies 
and parent mixed financial holding companies that have large institutions within their group. In accordance 
with Article 4(1) No 146 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, inter alia institutions with total assets of at least € 30 
billion are categorised as large institutions.
33 The internal control functions comprise the risk control and compliance functions as well as internal audit.

The EU banking package
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – July 2024 1305 Conclusion
The implementation of global standards will further strengthen the resilience of 
global financial markets.  By adopting  III and  VI, the  has sent an important CRR CRD EU
signal to the global financial supervisory community. Moreover, banking regulation will 
thus be adapted to the challenges of today and supervisors will be given new powers to 
better monitor new risks. 
German banks have sufficient capital.  The Bundesbank therefore does not expect that 
banks will need to raise additional capital in order to fulfil the new requirements. Nor 
does it see the financing of the real economy as being jeopardised by the 
implementation of the new rules.  This is partly thanks to the long phase-in period up 
to December 2032.

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.

institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name

ures based on the quarterly figures of the Federal Statistical Office, core budgets and
off-budget entities which are assigned to the general government sector.  2 The annual
figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state
and local government.  5 On the revenue side, this contains proceeds booked as dis-
posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.

publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
