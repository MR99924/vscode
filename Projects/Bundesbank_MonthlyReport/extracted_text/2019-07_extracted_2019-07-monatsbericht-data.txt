Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic output in Germany is likely to have 
contracted slightly in the second quarter of 
2019. The domestic economy probably con -
tinued to provide impetus. The labour market 
situation was still favourable although the 
slowdown in economic activity started to leave 
its mark. However, one- off effects that were 
driving growth during the first quarter petered 
out. Construction activity is likely to have de -
clined after a still very strong expansion in the 
first quarter supported by favourable weather 
conditions. Moreover, passenger car registra -
tions returned to normal. There had been a 
sharp rise previously, as car purchases were 
made which had been postponed in the second 
half of 2018 due to supply difficulties. This 
dampened private consumption in the second 
quarter. The decline in business with the UK 
weighed additionally upon already weak ex -
ports. In the first quarter, a significant number 
of purchases were brought forward in the run- 
up to the original Brexit date at the end of 
March. Even excluding these negative one- off 
factors, the underlying cyclical trend remained 
weak. This was mainly due to the fact that the 
downturn in the chiefly export- oriented indus -
try was continuing. Exports and industry are 
still not showing any signs of a recovery.
Industry
Industrial output was up significantly in May 
2019, 1% higher than in April after seasonal ad -
justment. On an average of April and May, 
however, due to the very weak previous month, 
industrial output was considerably below the 
average of the first quarter (-1%). One likely 
reason for this was the UK’s original plan to 
withdraw from the European Union at the end 
of March. Stocks were replenished there ahead of Brexit, meaning that fewer German products 
were in demand and being produced. Data 
available so far for the second quarter show 
that industry has not yet been able to move 
past its sluggish phase. Amongst others, the 
manufacture of motor vehicles and motor 
vehicle  parts declined steeply. According to 
data provided by the German Association of 
the Automotive Industry (VDA) on the numbers 
of passenger cars manufactured, motor vehicle 
output is likely to have remained rather slug -
gish as the quarter progressed. Moreover, Ger -
man manufacturers of machinery suffered con -
siderable losses in output in April and May 
compared with the first quarter. Manufacturers 
of computers, electronic and optical products, 
on the other hand, were able to significantly 
raise their output. Production in other transport 
equipment saw even steeper growth. However, 
the production of capital goods overall – like 
sales of intermediate goods – contracted con -
siderably (-1¼% and -1½% respectively). By 
contrast, producers of consumer goods re -
corded a slight increase (+¼%).
The order situation in German industry deteri -
orated substantially in May 2019. After sea -
sonal adjustment, the intake of orders declined 
by 2¼% on the month. Looking at April and 
May in aggregate, it was also significantly 
below the average of the first quarter of 2019 
(-1½%). The decrease was due mainly to the 
reduction in demand for industrial goods from 
Germany and the other euro area countries 
(-4% and -3¾% respectively), while the inflow 
of new orders from non- euro area countries 
recorded  a steep rise (+2½%). Capital goods 
played a significant role in this geographical 
divide. This applies in particular to the sharp 
fluctuations in new orders recorded in the 
automotive sector towards the end of the 
period under review. The volume of new motor 
vehicle orders from Germany and the euro area 
dropped significantly. By contrast, German car -
makers saw considerable growth in the inflow German

of new orders from non- euro area countries, 
which more than offset the declines from other 
regions. Producers of capital goods experi -
enced a major setback overall, however 
(-1¾%). The intermediate goods industry re -
ceived even fewer new orders (-2¼%). How -
ever, producers of consumer goods enjoyed 
strong growth in new orders (+2¾%).
Industrial sales and industrial output were dis -
tinctly divergent in May 2019, as in the previ -
ous month. This time the change in sales was 
weaker than that in output, however. After 
seasonal adjustment, there was a steep month- 
on- month decline of 1% in nominal sales. On 
an average of April and May, sales figures fell 
to a similar extent (-1¼%) compared with the 
first quarter. In regional terms, the decline was 
chiefly due to weak sales in Germany and in 
non- euro area countries. By contrast, sales 
stagnated in the euro area, with sales growth 
at German mechanical engineering firms and 
manufacturers of computers, electronic and 
optical products having a particularly stabilising 
effect. However, sales of capital goods – just 
like sales of intermediate goods – fell heavily 
overall. Only sales of consumer goods were up 
significantly. Nominal exports of goods in May 
2019 saw a steep seasonally adjusted rise on 
the previous month (+1¼%). Looking at April 
and May in aggregate, however, exports of 
goods declined strongly in both nominal and 
real terms (-2¼% in each case) compared with 
the first quarter of 2019. Exports to the United 
Kingdom were especially hard hit after they 
had risen strongly in the first quarter in the run- 
up to the Brexit date which was initially sched -
uled for the end of March. Nominal imports of 
goods decreased markedly in May 2019 after 
seasonal adjustment (-½%). On an average of 
April and May, they were down considerably in 
both nominal and real terms (-1½% and -1¾%) 
on the previous quarter.Significant fall in

Construction
Construction output declined steeply in May 
2019, falling by a seasonally adjusted 2½% on 
the month. The average for April and May was 
also considerably lower than the previous quar -
ter (-1¾%). Above all, significantly less activity 
in the finishing trades had a dampening effect 
(-3%). By contrast, the volume of production in 
the main construction sector was down only 
slightly (-¼%). This was probably partly attrib -
utable to the rebound effects in the context of 
the strong activity in the winter months on 
account  of the weather. The inflow of orders in 
the main construction sector also declined, fall -
ing strongly by 3¾% on the quarter in April 
2019 – data are available up to this date. The 
downturn since the turn of the year thus con -
tinued, after the inflow of orders had soared at 
the end of 2018 on the back of large orders. 
However, this probably does not suggest a 
rapid slowdown in the flourishing construction 
sector. Equipment utilisation and the reach of 
orders in the main construction industry were 
still at a very high level, according to surveys by 
the ifo Institute.
Labour market
The development in employment was still posi -
tive overall. After seasonal adjustment, the 
number of persons in work in May 2019 rose 
by 21,000 on the month. Employment was up 
by 462,000 persons, or 1.0%, in comparison to 
the same month one year earlier. This is due 
mainly to employment subject to social security 
contributions, which rose more strongly again 
in April in seasonally adjusted terms. However, 
the rise in jobs subject to social security contri -
butions – like growth in total employment – 
lost momentum compared with the previous 
year. Accord ing to data provided by the Federal 
Employ ment Agency, the economic sectors 
report ing the strongest growth in employment 
in April after seasonal adjustment included 
health and social care, business and support 
services (not including temporary agency work -ers), wholesale and retail and the information 
and communication sector. The manufacturing 
sector likewise posted a slight increase. By con -
trast, following persistent gains, employment 
in construction was slightly lower and job cuts 
in the cyclically sensitive temporary agency em -
ployment sector continued. Leading indicators 
suggest that employers’ willing ness to recruit 
was lower in June, too, although  still distinctly 
expansionary.
Registered unemployment remained virtually 
unchanged in June in seasonally adjusted 
terms, after previously posting a rise of 61,000 
persons due to a statistical break.1 Overall, 
around 2.28 million persons were registered 
with  the Federal Employment Agency as un -
employed and the unemployment rate was 
5%, as in the previous month. The number of 
unemployment benefit recipients under the 
statutory insurance scheme, which is above all 
cyclically driven, rose slightly by 8,000 persons 
in seasonally adjusted terms. However, the 
number of registered unemployed persons 
receiv ing the basic welfare allowance fell to the 
same extent. Cyclical short- time working in -
creased in April (more recent data are not avail -
able), but is still at a low level. According to the 
survey results of the ifo Institute, however, in -
dustrial enterprises might have increased short- 
time working in the meantime and expand it 
further in the next three months.2 The un -
employment barometer of the Institute for 
Employ ment Research (IAB) deteriorated mark -
edly again in June, suggesting a slight increase 
in unemployment in the next three months.
Prices
In June, crude oil prices were down signifi -
cantly on the month due to the gloomier de -
mand outlook. The May level was undershot by Steep decline in

cant impact on the seasonally adjusted changes in June

one- tenth on a monthly average and by more 
than 15% in a year- on- year comparison. As this 
report went to press, prices, at US$62, were 
still at roughly the June level. Crude oil futures 
were traded at a slight discount: US$1¼ for de -
liveries six months ahead and US$2¼ for deliv -
eries 12 months ahead.
Import prices fell slightly in May, which was 
mainly due to developments in the non- energy 
area. By contrast, the decline in producer 
prices, for which data are already available for 
June, stemmed primarily from the energy com -
ponent, while prices for other goods remained 
unchanged. At the end of the period under re -
view, the year- on- year figure for imports turned 
negative and dropped to 1.2% in the case of 
industrial producer prices.
Consumer prices (HICP) in June rose by a sea -
sonally adjusted 0.1%. Energy prices decreased 
as a result of the lower crude oil prices, but 
prices of food as well as of non- energy indus -
trial goods and of services were markedly 
higher. Annual  headline HICP inflation went up 
from 1.3% to 1.5% overall (CPI 1.6%, after 
1.4%). Excluding energy and food, it rose from 
0.9% to 1.5%, partly owing to the late timing 
of Whitsun. HICP as a whole is expected to 
show slightly more moderate growth again in 
the coming months. On the one hand, the 
lower crude oil prices have probably not yet 
been fully passed on to consumers and, on the 
other, prices for travel services are likely to 
dampen the inflation rate.
Public finances3
Local government finances
Local governments’ core budgets are usually in 
deficit in the first quarter.4 This year, at €5 bil -
lion, the deficit was €1 billion lower than a year 
ago. Revenue rose by 6½% (€3½ billion), in -
cluding a 4% increase in tax revenue (€½ bil -
lion). Contributing factors were the growth in 
revenue from local business tax together with the declining share thereof to be transferred to 
central and state government. Transfers from 
state government also went up by a substantial 
9½% (€2 billion). Proceeds from financial trans -
actions (primarily loan repayments) saw signifi -
cant growth of nearly €½ billion as well.
Expenditure increased by 4½% (€2½ billion), 
including a 4% rise in staff costs (€½ billion). 
This growth indicates that local government is 
continuing to add to its staff numbers. Other 
operating expenditure was considerably higher 
than one year previously (+6½%, or €1 billion), 
while the rise in social spending was only rela -
tively moderate (2%). Social assistance pay -
ments increased significantly, but accommoda -
tion costs for the long-  term unemployed de -
creased once more, as did benefits for asylum 
seekers, albeit at a slower rate. Fixed asset for -
mation continued at a very dynamic pace, with 
growth of 16½% (€1 billion).
As the year progresses, year- on- year revenue 
growth is expected to become slower. The lat -
est tax estimate only forecasts an increase of 
just over 2% in tax revenue for the year as a 
whole. Receipts from local business tax are 
even expected to decline somewhat. According 
to its projection for the German Financial Sta -
bility Council meeting in June, the Federal Min -
istry of Finance also anticipates a slower rise in 
state government transfers over the course of 
the year. Expenditure, on the other hand, is ex -
pected to grow at a similar pace as in the first 
quarter. On balance, local governments’ core 
budgets would post a slightly less favourable 
result than last year, but would still be running 
a very high surplus. The medium- term outlook Import and

3 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
developments during the preceding quarter. More detailed 
data can be found in the Statistical Section of the Monthly 
Reports.
4 Figures for the off- budget entities were not yet available 
as this report went to press. Local governments usually 
post a deficit in the first quarter because they initially 
receive  only minimal funds from their shares in income tax. 
This is offset by state government in the final quarter.Deutsche Bundesbank

is positive, too, provided growth in the econ -
omy as a whole is broadly stable in line with 
the baseline scenario. Further surpluses appear 
likely.
Local government was evidently able to cover 
the larger part of the deficit at the start of the 
year using reserves: the preliminary debt statis -
tics only show an increase of just under €2 bil -
lion between the end of 2018 and the end of 
March 2019.5 The debt level thus came to 
€136½ billion. The stock of cash advances rose 
moderately by €½ billion to €37½ billion. In 
Rhineland- Palatinate and Saarland, the per 
capita  increases were still appreciable. Besides 
these two federal states, North Rhine-  
Westphalia continued to report a very high 
stock of local government cash advances well 
in excess of €1,000 per capita.
Cash advances are actually intended simply to 
bridge short- term liquidity shortfalls. In the 
past, however, many local governments took 
to large- scale and long- term use of cash ad -
vances to plug structural budget shortfalls. 
State government has a duty to help ensure 
that its local governments have sufficient fund -
ing to perform their tasks. To do so, it can cre -
ate federal state- specific financial equalisation 
schemes involving transfers from state govern -
ment. At the same time, the duty of financial 
supervision over local government also gives 
state government the ability to enforce consoli -
dation measures. It appears that some state 
governments failed to intervene effectively 
when cash advances, some of them high, piled 
up. This has meant that the financial position 
of individual local governments has diverged 
very strongly, even within some federal states. 
The local government financial equalisation 
schemes have only partially counteracted this 
development.
Amongst other things, the Commission on 
Equivalent Living Conditions was tasked with 
proposing solutions to the problem of high 
local government cash advances. It was unable 
to reach an agreement, however. The Federal Government continues to emphasise that state 
government is responsible, but nonetheless 
offers to make a financial contribution in the 
event that an amicable solution is found. One 
starting point could be for central government 
to take on a larger share of the costs of social 
benefits, but local government discretion and 
control place limits on this, partly for efficiency 
reasons.6 Central government assistance for 
high volumes of cash advances will be granted 
only if there is a consensus. Moreover, it must 
be ensured that no such liabilities accrue again 
afterwards. In order to make sure of this, it 
would be worth considering a rule stipulating 
that, in future, local governments with budget 
shortages may take out cash advances only 
from their respective state government. If these Reserves used

advances are then counted under that state 
government’s debt brake, it would have an 
added incentive to take effective countermeas -
ures.7 Just last year, the federal state of Hesse 
took on the bulk of its local governments’ cash 
advances without using central government as -
sistance. In return, these local governments 
have to help repay the advances for up to 30 
years. From now on, all local governments in 
Hesse are required to consistently balance in -
come and expenditure in their budgets. If this 
kind of approach is properly pursued, future 
problems should be prevented.Statutory health insurance 
scheme
In the first quarter, the statutory health insur -
ance (SHI) scheme (comprising the health insur -
ance institutions and the health fund) posted 
the usual seasonal deficit. At €2½ billion, it was 
€½ billion higher on the year. The health fund 
posted a virtually unchanged deficit of €2½ bil -
lion, while the health insurance institutions ran 
a slight deficit, following a surplus of just under 
€½ billion at the start of the previous year. This 
deterioration is largely attributable to some -
what lower supplementary contribution rates 
charged by the health insurance institutions. 
According to data from the Federal Ministry of 
Health, the average supplementary contribu -
tion rate was 1.01%, which is 0.07 percentage 
point lower than a year ago.
The health insurance institutions’ revenue, 
which mainly consists of transfers from the 
health fund, grew by 3½%. If supplementary 
contribution rates had remained unchanged, 
revenue growth would have been ½ percent -
age point higher. Expenditure rose significantly 
by 4½%. The number of insured persons grew 
at a slightly slower pace (½%) than before, 
while growth picked up distinctly otherwise. 
The increase in payments for hospital treat -
ment (3%), a particularly large expenditure 
item, was clearly weaker than overall expend -
iture growth. One probable reason for this is 
that there was only a slight increase in the 
number of cases. The rise in expenditure on 
remedies and therapeutic appliances, sickness 
benefits and travelling expenses was far above 
average. There was an even stronger increase 
in other expenditure on benefits owing to the 
first transfers under the Care Staff Strengthen -
ing Act (Pflegepersonal-  Stärkungsgesetz) .
The health fund’s revenue grew by just under 
€3½%. This was down to a slightly stronger 
increase  in contribution receipts on the back of 
an unchanged central government grant (€14½ Slightly higher

insurance institutions, rose just as strongly as 
revenue.
Planning in the fourth quarter of 2018 included 
a slight deficit to be posted by the health fund 
for the year as a whole. Transfers are to be 
made from reserves to the innovation and 
structural funds. Although the macroeconomic 
setting worsened compared with the plans 
made in the fourth quarter of 2018, contribu -
tion receipts are shaped by changes in em -
ployee compensation and pensions. The out -
look for these has so far been stable. The esti -
mators’ expenditure projections have regularly 
proved to be too high in recent years. This does 
not appear to be the case for the current year. 
However, the average supplementary contribu -
tion rate is once again distinctly higher than 
would be required to balance out the esti -
mated expenditure (by 0.1 percentage point). It 
follows that the health insurance institutions 
would post a surplus of roughly €1½ billion. All 
in all, the SHI scheme could post a result that is 
almost half of the previous year’s outturn (2018 
surplus: €2½ billion).
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The core area8 of the public long- term care 
insur ance scheme recorded a surplus of €½ bil -
lion in the first quarter. At the start of 2018, it 
had still been running a deficit of €1 billion. 
The key reason for this strong improvement 
was the higher contribution rate. At the start of 
the year, it had been raised by 0.5 percentage 
point to 3.05% (plus an extra 0.25 percentage 
point for childless persons, as before). This 
caused revenue to shoot up by 24%. The rate 
hike probably has not yet taken full effect when 
it comes to contributions paid on pensions: 
pensions drawn since 2004 are generally paid out in arrears, and this also affects the contri -
butions to the long- term care insurance scheme 
due on those pensions. In addition, the new 
“mothers’ pensions” are being paid out subject 
to a delay, meaning that the associated in -
crease in contribution receipts was still moder -
ate. The first transfers from the SHI scheme to 
the long- term care insurance scheme under the 
Care Staff Strengthening Act had a positive 
effect . For this reason alone, total revenue was 
1½% higher.Another surplus

Expenditure rose strongly by just over 5½% at 
the start of the year. Higher care allowance 
payments and pension contributions for those 
providing care for a relative caused especially 
steep growth in cash benefits of 9% overall. 
The increase in benefits in kind was markedly 
smaller, at 4½%. In particular, the considerable 
level of expenditure on fully inpatient care stag -
nated after the strong rise in 2017.
Over the remainder of the year, expenditure 
growth could accelerate on account of efforts 
to improve the care situation. However, for the 
year as a whole, too, the raised contribution 
rate and additional revenue of €7½ billion will 
clearly dominate. Following a €3½ billion def -
icit last year, a significant surplus is therefore 
expected. Looking ahead, demographic change 
will place a considerable strain on the finances 
of the long- term care insurance scheme. Add -
itionally, the prospect of further increases in 
benefits was raised. On the whole, expenditure 
growth is thus likely to significantly outstrip the 
increase in the revenue base. It is therefore 
foreseeable that the contribution rate will rise 
further in the medium and long term. Beyond 
that, rising contribution rates for the statutory 
pension insurance and health insurance schemes 
are on the horizon. Against this backdrop, cau -
tion is advised with respect to any further in -
creases in benefits so as to prevent rising con -
tribution rates from placing  an undue strain on 
macroeconomic growth.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €122.5 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2019 was up on the previ -
ous month’s figure (€106.4 billion). After de -
ducting the lower redemptions and taking 
account  of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €42.7 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany rose by €8.8 billion during the report -ing month, which meant that the outstanding 
volume of debt instruments in the German 
market increased by €51.5 billion overall.
During the reporting month, the public sector 
issued debt securities worth €21.0 billion net 
(following net redemptions of €15.1 billion in 
April). Central government was the main issuer 
of new securities (€22.7 billion), chiefly in the 
form of two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze) to the tune of €11.9 billion and five- 
year Federal notes (Bobls) in the amount of 
€5.6 billion. It also issued Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills, €3.7 billion) and ten and 30- year 
Federal bonds (Bunds) totalling €2.9 billion and 
€1.6 billion respectively. State and local govern -
ments redeemed their own bonds worth €1.8 
billion net.
Domestic credit institutions raised their capital 
market debt by €20.1 billion net in May, follow -
ing net redemptions of €8.3 billion in April. In -
creases were seen primarily in the outstanding 
volume of debt securities issued by specialised 
credit institutions (€13.5 billion), which include, 
for example, public promotional banks. Mort -
gage Pfandbriefe and other bank securities that 
can be structured flexibly were also placed in 
the market totalling €4.0 billion and €3.6 bil -
lion net, respectively.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €1.6 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with €5.1 billion one month earlier. 
On balance, short- term commercial paper ac -
counted for the majority of issuance activity.
Foreign investors were the main buyers of 
bonds in May (€28.4 billion). Domestic non-  
banks also acquired bonds amounting to €15.0 
billion net. Domestic credit institutions pur -
chased bonds worth €4.1 billion net. Holdings 
of debt securities in the Bundesbank’s portfolio 
increased by €4.0 billion net. The vast majority 
of these were German debt securities issued by 
the public sector. As of 2019, the Eurosystem is 
no longer making net purchases under the 
expanded  asset purchase programme (APP). … but signifi -

However, principal payments will be smoothly 
reinvested over time so that individual months 
will ultimately see net acquisition or net re -
demption.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €1.1 billion net in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market rose by €1.8 bil -
lion over the same period. On balance, shares 
were purchased chiefly by domestic non- banks 
(€3.0 billion), but domestic credit institutions 
were likewise active in the market (€1.2 billion). 
By contrast, foreign investors reduced their 
equity exposure in Germany by €1.3 billion on 
balance.
Mutual funds
In May, German mutual funds recorded muted 
net inflows of €3.7 billion (April: €9.5 billion). 
On balance, specialised funds reserved for insti -
tutional investors were the chief beneficiaries 
(€2.3 billion). Among the asset classes, mixed 
securities- based funds, in particular, engaged in 
selling new shares (€2.5 billion). Bond funds, 
on the other hand, recorded outflows of equity 
funds amounting to €0.9 billion. The outstand -
ing volume of foreign mutual fund units distrib -
uted in Germany decreased by €1.5 billion in 
the reporting month. On balance, domestic 
non- banks were the only purchasers of mutual 
fund shares in May (€5.5 billion). The bulk of 
these were domestic securities. By contrast, do -
mestic credit institutions and foreign investors 
sold mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.5 billion in May 2019. The result was 
€6.4 billion down on the previous month’s 
level. Although the surplus in the goods ac -count expanded, the balance in invisible cur -
rent transactions, which comprises the services 
account as well as primary and secondary in -
come, narrowed to a much greater degree.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account increased by €2 billion on the 
month to €21.3 billion, with exports of goods 
rising more sharply than imports.
Germany recorded a deficit of €4.8 billion in 
invisible current transactions in May, compared 
with a surplus of €3.6 billion in April. This was 
mainly caused by a decline in the primary in -
come balance which outweighed the upturn in 
the secondary income balance. Moreover, the 
deficit in the services account widened.
The primary income account recorded net ex -
penditure in the amount of €4.2 billion, com -
pared with net receipts of €7.8 billion in April.

ments on portfolio investments by non-  
residents in that month. In the secondary in -
come account, the balance shifted from net 
expenditure (€3.6 billion) in April to net receipts 
(€0.5 billion). This increase was mainly due to 
higher general government tax revenue from 
non- residents owing to the higher dividend 
payments on portfolio investments. In the ser -
vices account, the deficit widened by €0.5 bil -
lion to €1.1 billion. Revenue saw rises in a num -
ber of items, but the increase in expenditure, 
largely on the back of higher private spending 
on travel, was stronger.
In May 2019, the international capital markets 
were influenced by a gloomier economic out -
look and the expectation that the low interest 
rate environment would become entrenched. 
Germany’s cross- border portfolio investment 
generated net capital imports in the amount of 
€17.1 billion, compared with net capital exports 
of €19.9 billion in April. Foreign investors added 
German securities worth €25.8 billion net to 
their portfolios. They focused on domestic debt 
securities (€28.4 billion), purchasing both pub -
lic and private bonds (€18.8 billion) and money 
market paper (€9.6 billion). By contrast, they 
parted with German shares and investment 
fund shares (€1.3 billion each). Domestic invest-
ors also purchased foreign securities on bal -
ance (€8.7 billion). They acquired debt secur -
ities in particular (€8.8 billion), with demand 
split between money market paper (€6.5 bil -

they invested in foreign shares (€1.4 billion), 
while parting with investment fund shares 
(€1.5 billion).
Direct investment recorded net capital imports 
of €1.8 billion in May, compared with net cap -

Germany by €11.9 billion net, predominantly 
through intra- group lending (€10.8 billion).

boosted their equity capital (€1.1 billion). Enter -

net capital exports by the banking system 
amounting to €31.2 billion. The Bundesbank’s net asset position grew by €23.8 billion. In -
creased TARGET2 claims in the amount of 
€14.9 billion contributed to the Bundesbank’s 
higher net claims. Monetary financial institu -
tions (excluding the Bundesbank) also recorded 
net capital outflows (€7.5 billion). These were 
primarily attributable to lower liabilities to for -
eign counterparties. By contrast, non- banks 
generated net funds of €6.0 billion. This was

Parallels in the exchange rate movements 
of major currencies
Parallel exchange rate movements of individual currencies can often be seen on the foreign 
exchange markets. These striking patterns can have a variety of different causes. For example, 
pegging one currency to another necessarily leads to a co- movement of their exchange rates vis- 
à- vis a third currency. But co- movement is also often seen between floating exchange rates, 
brought about, among other things, by spillover effects. Such parallel exchange rate develop -
ments stand out particularly after events that lead to pronounced market reactions, for example 
after the announcement of the Eurosystem’s expanded asset purchase programme, the turmoil 
on the foreign exchange markets in connection with the Turkish lira in the summer of 2018, and 
after the referendum on the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.
In order to examine whether these illustrative observations represent a systematic pattern, rela -
tionships between the exchange rates of major advanced economies are estimated using an 
econometric model. This identifies three currency blocs whose exchange rates display systematic 
relationships and even recognises contemporaneous causal relationships between the exchange 
rates using a machine learning algorithm.
Key determinants for inclusion in the identified currency blocs include the intensity of trade links 
and financial ties, patterns of trade and expectations regarding economic policy risks. One of 
these blocs comprises three European currencies (the euro, the Swedish krona and the Norwegian 
krone), the underlying economies of which are all part of the European Economic Area. A second 
bloc comprises the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, i.e. curren -
cies of countries that are relatively major commodity exporters. Finally, the approach identifies a 
bloc comprising the Swiss franc, the US dollar and the Japanese yen. These are safe haven cur -
rencies or carry trade financing currencies, which tend to appreciate in times of high financial 
market stress.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
On the foreign exchange markets, parallels can 
often be observed in bilateral exchange rate 
movements. These parallels can have a variety 
of different causes. However, similar exchange 
rate movements often indicate that the cur -
rency areas concerned have common eco -
nomic characteristics. For example, similar ex -
change rate movements can indicate that the 
respective central banks have the same monet -
ary policy anchor or at least a similar monetary 
policy orientation. Co- movement of exchange 
rates often also reflects market participants’ 
expect ations and assessments. If, for example, 
country-  specific market turmoil results in a 
number of other currencies also depreciating, 
this could be because market participants in 
these countries regard the risk of contagion 
effects  to be particularly high.
Although common exchange rate movements 
often reflect economic ties or economic policy 
linkages, the fact that they are observed does 
not, in itself, provide any indication of the spe -
cific cause of such relationships. Precisely be -
cause there are so many possible causes, ob -
servation must be paired with expert know -
ledge for a meaningful interpretation.1 The 
purpose of this article is therefore to present 
parallels in the movements of selected ex -
change rates, identify systematic relationships, 
and analyse them with theoretical consider -
ations in mind.The phenomenon of parallel 
exchange rate movements 
by way of three examples
Parallel exchange rate 
responses  following the 
adoption  of the Eurosystem’s 
expanded asset purchase 
programme 
On 22 January 2015, the Governing Council of 
the ECB adopted the expanded asset purchase 
programme (APP) in response to a series of 
negative surprises in the inflation rate and de -
clining inflation expectations in the euro area. 
It included, among other things, a public sector 
purchase programme and thus enabled the 
Euro system to greatly increase the volume of 
its asset purchases from its previous level. Such 
a monetary policy easing can lead to a depreci -
ation of the euro via a number of channels.2
Indeed, immediately afterwards, there was a 
sharp depreciation of the euro against a num -
ber of major currencies. As the ECB reference 
rates had already been determined (14:15 CET) 
by the time the decision on the APP was an -
nounced (during a press conference as of 
14:30), the earliest visible market reactions 
were the changes in the reference rates from 
22 to 23 January 2015. Measured by the daily 
rate of change in effective terms, this period 
saw the second- largest depreciation of the 
euro ever. However, developments in the effect-
ive euro exchange rate do not allow any con -
clusions to be drawn on co- movements be -
tween currencies. For this to be done, it is neces-
sary to examine bilateral or, if necessary, add -
itional effective exchange rates.3Parallels in

covered by this article. Such an approach would entail add -

weight partner currencies differently.Deutsche Bundesbank

The importance of the reference currency in estimating 
the relationships between bilateral exchange rates
In an econometric estimation of the rela-
tionships between bilateral exchange rates, 
the results depend crucially on the choice of 
reference currency. A reference currency is 
the currency to which a bilateral exchange 
rate refers. For example, in the case of an 
exchange rate for the euro and the US dol-
lar of US$1.14 per euro, the euro is the ref-
erence currency. But the same exchange 
rate can also be expressed with the US dol-
lar as the reference currency: €0.88 per US 
dollar.  Each of the quotations is the inverse 
of the othe r, in this example:
1.14US$
AC=1
0.88AC
US$.
If potential parallels are to be drawn be-
tween the exchange rate movements of dif-
ferent currencies, it makes sense to express 
the exchange rates under review in a single 
reference currency. Only then are exchange 
rate developments comparable. But this 
also means that no relationships can be ob-
served for the reference currency itself. Put 
in more general terms, for N +1 different 
currencies, only the relationships between 
N bilateral exchange rates can be analysed.1
Correlation or regression analysis is often 
employed to measure the relationships be-
tween exchange rates.2 In the case of a 
regres sion analysis, for example, the impact 
of the rates of change in the exchange rate 
of  one currency pair on the rates of change 
of another pair are estimated, with the ref-
erence currency being the same for all ex-
change rates under review. However, such 
an analysis is problematic if the exchange 
rate of one (or both) of the currency pairs 
under review is pegged against the refer-
ence currency or kept  by and large stable by 
central bank measures. The rate of change 
used in the analysis would then be at least 
broadly constant, and the correlation or re-gression coeffi   cient would contain scarcely 
any information on possible relationships. 
In such an instance, it would not be pos-
sible to establish, even for the currencies 
whose possible relationship is to be deter-
mined, whether or not they are related by a 
fi  xed  exchange rate regime.
An appropriate reference currency for these 
analyses should therefore on no account be 
fi  rmly pegged to one of the other curren-
cies under review, nor should it be an an-
chor currency for the other currencies.3 
Ideally, the reference currency should not 
generally be correlated with other curren-
cies under review.4 As the correlations vary 
according to the currencies under review 
and the observation period, it is not pos-
sible to make a general statement about 
the ideal reference currency that would 
apply to all analyses. For this reason, com-
pletely different reference currencies are 
1 Much the same would apply for effective exchange 
rates if an effective exchange rate were calculated for 
each currency. The effective exchange rate of currency 
N+1 could be derived from the exchange rates of the 
N other currencies. One drawback of using effective 
exchange rates, however, is that the weights on which 
their calculation is based vary from country to country. 
As a result, the observed rates of change are compar-
able to only a limited extent.

(1994).
3 The crawling peg exchange rate regime, in which 
one of the two currencies depreciates against the ref-
erence currency by a static percentage in each period, 
would also cause statistical problems if, for instance, 
the other currency were pegged against the reference 
currency. If, in a regression equation, the rates of 
change in one exchange rate were regressed on the 
rates of change in the other as normal, the constant in 
the equation would refl  ect the exchange rate change 
trend caused by the central bank. By contrast, the 
regres sion coeffi   cient of the rate of change in the 
exchange  rate would not point to any relationship.
4 One way in which this could be assessed is to carry 
out additional estimations with alternative reference 
currencies. The literature also provides some sugges-
tions (see, for example, Aloosh and Bekaert (2019) or 
International Monetary Fund (2019)).Deutsche Bundesbank

often used in various studies in the litera-
ture.5
A correlation analysis of bilateral exchange 
rates with two alternative reference curren-
cies clearly illustrates the problem.6 The 
above tables show the correlation coeffi   -
cients between the rates of change in each 
of the bilateral exchange rates. In the upper 
table, these are based on rates of change in 
euro exchange rates, while, in the lower 
table, they are based on exchange rates in 
which the pound sterling serves as the ref-
erence currency.
The currencies compared with each other 
here include the Bulgarian lev and the Dan-
ish krone. These two currencies are more or 
less fi  rmly pegged to the euro – the Bulgar-
ian lev via a currency board and the Danish krone as part of Exchange Rate Mechan-
ism II. The exchange rates of these curren-
cies therefore follow a very similar course 
over time, and the corresponding correl-
ation coeffi   cient should be very high and 
close to one. However, opting for the euro 
as the reference currency in the analysis 
would give rise to the problems described 
above. Despite the obvious co- movement 
of the two currencies, the correlation coef-
fi  cient of -0.01 between them incorrectly 
suggests that the Bulgarian lev and the 
Danish krone are not correlated. By con-
trast, the table shows a high correlation be-
tween the US dollar and the Chinese ren-
minbi (0.92).  Indeed, the daily fl  uctuation 
band of the  Chinese renminbi vis- à- vis the 
US dollar is tight. The pound sterling, too, is 
slightly correlated with these two currencies 
(0.38 and 0.41, respectively). The remaining 
correlation coeffi   cients for the euro ex-
change rates are small.
Using the pound sterling as the reference 
currency shows  clearer, economically plaus-
ible patterns:  fi  rst, the Bulgarian lev, the 
Danish krone and the euro are perfectly 
correlated (1.00), while,  second, the table 
also shows a high correlation between the 
Chinese renminbi and the US dollar (0.94). 
As the fl  exibility of both of these currencies 
is not restricted versus either  the euro or 
the pound sterling, their correlation coeffi   -
cient realistically captures their  relationship 
to each other for both reference currencies. 
The two currency groups are also positively 
correlated with each other. However, the 
correlation between the groups, with cor-
relation coeffi   cients of 0.56 and 0.58,  is sig-
nifi  cantly lower than within the groups. 
Nevertheless, there seems to be a not insig-
5 Instead of individual reference currencies, the litera-
ture also considers alternatives such as the currency 
basket of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) spe-
cial drawing rights as a reference (see Frankel and Wei 
(1993)).

by the ECB are used for the purpose of this analysis.

nifi  cant relationship between them. This is 
due in part to the fact that all exchange 
rates with the pound sterling have a com-
mon reference currency which infl  uences 
the development of all of the exchange 
rates.
This example illustrates the grave implica-
tions that the choice of reference currency 
may have for the estimation results. Taking 
the euro as the reference currency com-
pletely eliminates the actually very high cor-
relation between the Bulgarian lev and the 
Danish krone, as both currencies are  pegged 
to the euro. As a result, it erroneously ap-
pears that the currencies are not linked. As 
described above, it is therefore impossible, 
when using euro exchange  rates for the 
Bulgarian lev and the Danish krone, to dif-
ferentiate in statistical terms between fi  xed 
and fl  oating exchange rate regimes .
The need to select a reference currency that 
is, as far as possible, highly fl  exible against 
all currencies covered by the analysis is 
made more diffi   cult by the fact that curren-
cies are, de facto, often not as independent 
as portrayed by the authorities de jure. 
Some countries report that their currency is 
fl  exible, even though fl  exibility is in fact 
limited.7 An overview of the actual ex-
change rate regimes of virtually all curren-
cies is published at regular intervals by the 
IMF in its Annual Report on Exchange Ar-
rangements and Exchange Restrictions.8,9
Moreover, some currencies tend to follow 
similar trends even without monetary policy 
intervention – in times of heightened fi  nan-
cial stress, for example.10 For the reasons 
cited above, such relationships should like-
wise be taken into account when selecting 
the reference currency.
For a time, use of the Swiss franc as refer-
ence currency was very widespread in the 
econometric analysis of possible relation-
ships between exchange rates. However, 
the Swiss National Bank introduced a min-imum exchange rate against the euro in 
September 2011, which it then repealed in 
January 2015. During this period, there 
were times where the Swiss franc’s ex-
change rate against the euro barely devi-
ated from the aforementioned minimum 
exchange rate. For that reason, the Swiss 
franc is, as a rule, no longer a suitable refer-
ence currency for this period . Instead, the 
pound sterling currently appears to be a 
relatively attractive reference currency. First, 
the Bank of England does not have an 
active  exchange rate policy. Second, the 
pound sterling is not an anchor currency for 
any other currencies.11 Third, it appears, 
generally speaking, to be only relatively 
weakly correlated with other currencies  and 
to be relatively independent, even in times 
of heightened fi  nancial stress.12
7 See Calvo and Reinhart (2002).
8 See International Monetary Fund (2019).
9 Some central banks, such as the Monetary Authority 
of Singapore, gear their exchange rate policy towards 
a basket of several currencies. What tend to be most 
problematic in statistical terms, however, are fi  xed ex-
change rates vis- à- vis individual currencies.
10 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2014).
11 See International Monetary Fund (2019). However, 
it may well be that some central banks which gear 
their exchange rate policy towards a basket of curren-
cies also take account of the pound sterling.

When looking at the response of bilateral euro 
exchange rates to the adoption of the APP , a 
distinction should first of all be made between 
fixed and floating exchange rate regimes. In 
the case of a fixed exchange rate regime, a 
central bank will, if necessary, intervene on the 
foreign exchange market to stabilise the ex -change rate of its own currency vis- à- vis an an -
chor currency. This may, for example, be sens -
ible if there are very close trade links or it may 
serve to enhance the credibility of the central 
bank in pursuing a stability- oriented monetary 
policy.
Fixed exchange rate regimes regularly directly 
lead to parallel exchange rate movements. This 
can also be seen in the response of bilateral 
euro exchange rates to the adoption of the 
APP , for example for currencies that are pegged 
either to the euro or the US dollar. As can be 
seen in the euro reference exchange rates at 
that time, there were no marked changes in 
the euro against the Bulgarian lev or the Danish 
krone. By contrast, the euro’s movements 
against the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar 
were relatively sharp, with the euro depreciat -
ing against both currencies by 3.6% the follow -
ing day. Nevertheless, the movements of both 
euro exchange rates follow an almost identical 
pattern. Even over a longer period, the euro 
exchange  rates of the Bulgarian lev and the 
Danish krone, on the one hand, and of the US 
dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, on the other 
hand, remain close to each other. In both 
cases, the reason for the co- movement of the 
exchange rates is the way the exchange rates 
of these currencies are set. While the Eurosys -
tem and the Federal Reserve System allow the 
exchange rates of their currencies to be freely 
determined by the supply and demand of for -
eign exchange, the authorities in Bulgaria and 
Denmark peg their currencies to the euro and 
those in Hong Kong peg their currency to the 
US dollar.4
Fixed exchange rate regimes should therefore 
be noted as a first source of parallel exchange 
rate developments. Following the adoption of 
the APP , however, there were also parallels in 
the exchange rate movements of currencies 
which are subject to a flexible exchange rate Exchange rate

regime. From 22 to 23 January 2015, i.e. imme -
diately following the announcement of the 
adoption of the APP , the euro depreciated sig -
nificantly not only against the US dollar, but 
also against the Japanese yen (-3.4%). Com -
paratively large losses were also seen against 
the Canadian dollar (-2.9%), the pound sterling 
(-2.2%) and the New Zealand dollar (-2.0%). 
The euro fell less strongly against a group of 
European currencies comprising the Norwegian 
krone (-1.4%), the Swiss franc (-1.3%) and the 
Swedish krona (-1.1%). It depreciated only 
slightly against the Australian dollar (-0.9%).
The immediate exchange rate response was, 
for instance, fairly similar in terms of the sharp 
depreciation of the euro against the US dollar 
and the Japanese yen. The same is true of the 
somewhat less pronounced reactions of Euro -
pean currencies. These correlations between 
the aforementioned euro exchange rates re -
mained largely intact for the remainder of the 
period under review. For example, in the two 
weeks following the adoption of the APP , a sig -
nificant co- movement is observable for the cur -
rencies of Australia and New Zealand, despite 
the initially divergent responses. Furthermore, 
over this two- week period, the US dollar and 
the Japanese yen also move virtually in unison. 
Finally, the sharp appreciation of the euro 
against the Swiss franc is striking, decoupling 
the Swiss currency from its co- movement with 
the Swedish krona and the Norwegian krone.5 
Possible reasons for these parallel exchange 
rate movements of currencies not subject to a 
fixed exchange rate regime are discussed 
below, following the analysis of two further ex -
emplary episodes of exchange rate co-  
movement.
Parallel exchange rate reactions 
after the UK referendum on 
leaving the European Union
On 23 June 2016, a referendum was held in the 
United Kingdom on whether the country 
should leave the European Union (EU). A ma -jority of just under 52% of votes cast were in 
favour of withdrawal. This outcome of the ref -
erendum appeared to come as a surprise to 
many market participants, which can be seen, 
among other things, from the response on the 
foreign exchange markets. The pound sterling 
depreciated very sharply against all other cur -
rencies of advanced economies, both on a daily 
and two- week view.
The exchange rates of all currencies under con -
sideration against the pound sterling followed 
a rather similar path in the two weeks follow -
ing the vote. A further reason (besides the ex -
change rate regime) for the co- movement in 
exchange rates is even more apparent here 
than after the adoption of the APP: if the ex -
change rate of all other currencies is expressed 
vis- à- vis a single reference currency, such as the 
pound sterling in this case, parallel movements 
in exchange rates occur if the reference cur -
rency is shaken by an event of such magnitude 
that it overshadows stimuli from all other cur -
rency areas. In this case, it can therefore be 
assumed  that the depreciation of the pound 
was primarily attributable to the referendum 
result and not to country- specific events in the 
other currency areas.
Despite the above- mentioned similarities across 
all pound sterling exchange rates, differences 
can also be observed, as co- movement be -
tween certain exchange rates is tighter than 
between others. For example, the pound ster -
ling depreciated less strongly against the Euro -
pean currencies under consideration than 
against non- European currencies. This implies 
that non- European currencies not only appreci -
ated against the pound sterling, but also 
against other European currencies. Market par -… for example

reassessment 
of economic 
outlook
5 The Swiss franc experienced relatively large exchange 
rate fluctuations in this period. On 15 January 2015, i.e. 
before the announcement of the APP , the Swiss National 
Bank suspended the franc’s exchange rate floor vis-  à- vis 
the euro, resulting in strong reactions in the foreign ex -
change markets. This triggered a marked short- term appre -
ciation of the Swiss franc against the euro, followed by a 
counter- reaction. This can be seen clearly in the chart on 
p. 22.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2019  
23

ticipants clearly assumed that the now ex -
pected withdrawal from the EU would weaken 
not only the British economy, but also the eco -
nomic development of other European coun -
tries, albeit to a lesser extent. The parallel ex -
change rate developments are therefore a re -
flection of a similar reassessment of the eco -
nomic outlook in some countries, in divergence 
from the assessment of other countries.
A look at the percentage changes in various 
pound sterling exchange rates from the day of 
the referendum on 23 June 2016 to the follow -
ing day, calculated from the euro reference ex -
change rates, reveals a further peculiarity. For 
example, as in the case of the adoption of the 
APP , exchange rate movements against the 
Japanese yen (-10.8%) and the US dollar 
(-7.8%) were particularly pronounced. There 
were almost identical percentage changes 
against the Australian dollar (-6.1%), the New 
Zealand dollar (-6.0%) and the Canadian dollar 
(-6.0%). The pound sterling also lost slightly more ground against the Swiss franc (-5.7%) 
than against other European currencies. As 
mentioned above, the depreciation against 
European currencies such as the euro (-5.1%), 
the Norwegian krone (-3.9%) and the Swedish 
krona (-3.5%) was less marked. These rates 
show that, in most cases, the currencies with 
similar exchange rate movements are the same 
as those following the adoption of the APP . 
Once again, the Japanese yen and the US dol -
lar exhibit the strongest exchange rate re action. 
In addition, parallels are observable between 
the currencies of commodity exporting coun -
tries and between some European currencies. 
These relationships are also strikingly persistent 
over time. Parallel exchange rate movements of 
unpegged currencies are therefore also not ne -
cessarily a one-  off phenomenon, but can be 
observed on a recurring basis.
Parallel exchange rate reactions 
to the Turkish lira’s weak streak 
in the summer of 2018
In the summer of 2018, the Turkish lira fell 
sharply against the currencies of advanced 
economies.6 The appreciation of the world’s 
most important currency, the US dollar, against 
the Turkish lira was partly attributable to a 
trade conflict between Turkey and the United 
States. A number of monetary policy measures 
were only able to slow the lira’s slide temporar -
ily. The US dollar’s appreciation against the 
Turkish lira from 9 to 10 August 2018 (+12%) as 
well as over the weekend of 10 to 13 August 
2018 (a further +14%) was particularly striking, 
bringing the US currency to a new all- time high 
against the lira.Correlations in

6 To analyse these exchange rate movements, the ex -
change rates used here are expressed against the US dollar 
as the reference currency. This is because a number of 
emerging market economies tend to orientate their monet -
ary policy to the US dollar without operating a genuine 
fixed exchange rate regime. As the US dollar is used as the 
reference currency, US dollar effects between the exchange 
rates are masked. At the same time, the links of the ob -
served emerging market currencies to the US dollar are not 
so strict as to make it impossible to interpret correlations 
between US dollar- based exchange rates.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2019

Such a sharp appreciation in the foreign ex -
change markets is comparatively rare and 
therefore drew a lot of attention from market 
participants. From Thursday, 9 August, to Mon -
day, 13 August 2018, the US dollar also rose 
against the currencies of most other major 
economies. The currency appreciation was, 
however, far smaller than against the Turkish 
lira: +1.7% against the euro, +1.0% against the 
pound sterling, +1.9% against the Swedish 
krona, +0.9% against the Canadian dollar, 
+1.5% against the Norwegian krone, +2.0% 
against the Australian dollar, and +1.2% against 
the New Zealand dollar. The exchange rate 
remained  virtually unchanged against the Swiss 
franc. The US dollar depreciated only against 
the Japanese yen.
The US dollar therefore gained in value against 
all observed currencies except for the Swiss 
franc and the Japanese yen. This is interesting, 
as the latter two currencies are considered safe 
haven currencies or carry trade financing cur -
rencies and tend to appreciate in times of 
finan cial market turmoil.7 The exchange rate 
responses at the time thus suggest that uncer -
tainty on the foreign exchange markets in -
creased over these days and the security of safe 
haven currencies and carry trade financing cur -
rencies was sought after (as carry trades be -
came less attractive). A co- movement of ex -
change rates can therefore also arise if several 
currencies are considered to be particularly safe 
in times of crisis. A parallel movement of ex -
change rates already stood out in the afore -
mentioned examples, at least for the US dollar 
and the Japanese yen.
Ultimately, the question arises as to whether a 
correlation existed between the Turkish lira and 
other emerging market currencies during this 
period. Indeed, between 9 and 13 August 2018, 
the US dollar not only appreciated against the 
Turkish lira, it also rose by 6.5% against the 
South African rand. It also gained markedly 
against the Brazilian real (+3.1%), the Indian Appreciation of

the Mexican peso (+3.3%) and the Russian 
rouble  (+2.9%).
Looking at subsequent exchange rate develop -
ments, the reactions of the South African rand 
and the Brazilian real were the most pro -
nounced – alongside those of the Turkish lira. 
The exchange rates of other emerging market 
economies followed paths that were more in 
line with those of the advanced economies. 
The relatively strong appreciation of the US dol -
lar against the rand could indicate that invest -
ors may have expected the crisis to spill over 
from Turkey to South Africa. With regard to 
such a conclusion, however, it should be noted 
that country- specific events may also have con -
tributed to the simultaneous depreciation of 
the South African rand. For example, discus -
sions at the time about expropriations of land 
in South Africa led to uncertainty among in -
vestors, which also weighed on the rand. This 
example shows that it is very difficult to distin -
guish between economic developments that 
happen to occur at the same time and conta -
gion effects as the cause of parallel exchange 
rate developments.
Empirical analysis of the rela -
tionships between exchange 
rates of advanced economies
In the above examples, recurring parallel ex -
change rate movements were identified for 
some currencies, for example for the US dollar 
and the Japanese yen. In addition, the ex -
change rates of some European currencies such 
as the euro, the Swedish krona and the Norwe -
gian krone followed relatively similar paths. 
Finally  , co- movement in exchange rates was 
also repeatedly observed for the Australian dol -
lar and the New Zealand dollar.
The observation of co- movements in these ex -
amples arises thus far only from descriptive 
statistics and is not in itself evidence of system -
atic relationships. In order to be able to draw any substantive conclusions, it is necessary to 
estimate connectedness using statistical meth -
odologies.
For analysing issues of this kind, an approach 
developed by Diebold and Yılmaz (2009, 2014) 
has become established in the economic litera -
ture. It is based on the underlying assumption 
that there are simultaneous and lagged correl -
ations between economic time series, such as 
those on exchange rates, and that develop -
ments in these time series are driven by unex -
pected events, known as shocks or innovations. 
In this analytical framework, there is a strong 
connectedness between two time series if the 
innovations of one time series have a relatively 
high impact on the development of the other 
time series.8
Since then, this general approach has been fur -
ther enhanced and applied to different eco -
nomic variables such as bond yields, default 
risk, and even rates of change in exchange 
rates. It became clear that it was particularly 
difficult to determine contemporaneous causal 
relationships.9 Bettendorf and Heinlein (2019) 
show how this can be achieved using machine 
learning methods.10
This approach was used to estimate the rela -
tionships between the rates of change for the 
currencies of the advanced economies already 
analysed in the examples. It involved observing 
the daily rates of change in the exchange rates 
of the currencies, with the pound sterling as 
the reference currency.11 The pound sterling 
was selected as the reference currency because 
it displays relatively low correlation with other 
currencies (see pp.  19 ff.). The picture that Spillover of

if the variables systematically move in opposite directions.
9 In this context, causality does not refer to an economic 
model, meaning that the relationships between the ex -
change rates cannot be explained using economic reasons. 
Instead, it should be considered as a purely data-  based, 
statistical concept in this case.

emerges for the analysis period from January 
2010 to December 2017 confirms the relation -
ships previously observed in the examples.
The model measures strong connections within 
a bloc of European currencies (the euro, the 
Swedish krona and the Norwegian krone). It 
also identifies a bloc of currencies comprising 
the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dol -
lar. The strong co- movement between the ex -
change rates of these three currencies can be 
put down to the fact that they represent coun -
tries that rely relatively heavily on commodities 
exports. Finally, the model assigns the Swiss 
franc, the US dollar and the Japanese yen to a 
common bloc. Indeed, these currencies do also 
appear  to share common ground. They are 
used in the financial markets as safe haven cur -
rencies or carry trade financing currencies and 
therefore tend to appreciate during periods of 
financial market turmoil.
Overall, 62.2% of the total variability in the 
rates of change in the exchange rate can be 
explained by reasons that are specific to the ex -
change rate under review.12 The remaining 
37.8% of the total variability, on the other 
hand, can be attributed to the influence of 
other exchange rates – spillover effects, in 
other words.
All in all, the empirical model can prove the ex -
istence of systematic links between individual 
exchange rates, which, to a large extent, could 
already be observed in the examples shown 
above. The currency blocs identified appear 
economically plausible and are also consistent 
with the findings of other studies. Greenwood- 
Nimmo et al. (2016), for example, find similarly 
strong relationships between the Australian 
dollar and the New Zealand dollar, as well as 
between the European currencies mentioned 
above. However, their study cannot reach any 
definite conclusions regarding the contempor -
aneous direction of causality. Because the study 
uses the US dollar as the reference currency, 
the relationships between safe haven curren -cies and carry trade financing currencies are 
not clear, either.13
Causes of parallel exchange 
rate movements
Together with the empirical analysis, the ex -
amples above show that it is possible to pro -
vide evidence of systematic relationships be -
tween the exchange rates of different curren -
cies. Examples of potential economic causes 
for the parallel movements identified have 
already  been put forward. These causes can be

– If a country’s monetary policy is geared to -
wards stabilising the exchange rate of the 
domestic currency vis- à- vis a particular an -
chor currency, the exchange rates of these 
two curren cies expressed in an independent 
third currency are, naturally, very similar or 
even identical. This was illustrated by the ex -
ample above, which showed different ex -
change rate responses to the Eurosystem’s 
decisions regarding the APP . The US dollar 
and the Hong Kong dollar – which is pegged 
to the US dollar – each appreciated against 
the euro by exactly the same percentage. 
Parallel exchange rate movements that re -
sult from fixed exchange rate regimes are 
not deemed to be spillover effects because 
the choice of exchange rate regime – in this 
case fixing or stabilising rates – is an inde -
pendent decision taken by each individual 
country.
– Leaving aside fixed exchange rate regimes, 
the causes of parallel developments in flex -ible exchange rates can be assigned to three 
other categories. For instance, co- movement 
between exchange rates develops vis- à- vis a 
reference currency if the currency is hit by a 
domestic impulse strong enough to over -
shadow all other disruptive factors stem -
ming from the other currency areas. Again, 
this phenomenon could be observed in the 
euro exchange rates in the wake of the 
adoption of the APP – but particularly after 
the announcement of the results of the 
United Kingdom’s referendum on withdraw -
ing from the EU. The exchanges rates of 
many other currencies against the pound 
sterling showed fairly similar movements for 
weeks thereafter. Here, too, it is not a spill -
over effect between exchange rates that is 
responsible for their co- movement. On the 
contrary, if there were spillover effects from 
the reference currency to other currencies, 
the relationship between the other curren -
cies would tend to weaken.A fixed

Estimating the causal relationships between bilateral 
exchange rates using machine learning methods
Relationships between time series can be 
estimated in various different ways. The 
current analysis presents an econometric 
method of estimating relationships be-
tween the rates of change of bilateral ex-
change rates following the approach of 
Diebold and Yılmaz (2009, 2014), which is 
established in the economic literature. This 
method is based on a reduced- form vector 
autoregression (VAR) model:
yt=y t1+✏t,
where yt represents a vector with observa-
tions of all K endogenous variables. In the 
case at hand, these variables are the rates 
of change of bilateral exchange rates, de-
fi  ned in relation to a single reference cur-
rency. The ( K×K) Φ matrix contains re-
gression coeffi   cients that relate to the ob-
servations of endogenous variables, lagged 
by one period (yt-1). The variable /uni03F5t denotes 
the error term that cannot be explained by 
the model.1 In the VAR model, therefore, 
the exchange rates at time t are explained 
by the rates of the preceding period. The 
VAR model above can also be expressed in 
the form
yt=⇥(L)✏t
(moving average representation), where 
L  is the operator for delayed error terms 
(lag operator). This is defi  ned by Lyt = yt-1. 
The lag polynomial is thus given as Θ (L) = 
(I – Φ L )-1,2 meaning that the exchange 
rates at time t represent the sum of all pre-
vious disturbances.
In structural form, i.e. when the VAR model 
is transformed in such a way that the ut 
error terms (shocks) are uncorrelated, the 
model is written as
yt=A(L)ut.Here, A(L) = Θ  (L)B0-1 and ut = B0/uni03F5.stst, 
where B0 in Diebold und Yılmaz (2009) cor-
responds to the Cholesky decomposition of 
the covariance matrix of /uni03F5.stst.3 However, 
these results are, to a certain extent, arbi-
trary, as they are dependent on the order of 
the variables in yt on account of the 
Cholesky decomposition.4
In the following, the forecast error variance 
of the observed variables is decomposed 
into the contributions made by individual 
shocks.5 This allows us to determine how 
strongly the shock to a particular equation 
of the system impacts upon other exchange 
rates. Using an appropriate reference cur-
rency,6 these effects can thus be interpreted 
as spillover effects. The optimal forecast 
value for yt+1 at time t  is calculated as 
yt+1,t = Φyt, where the forecast error is 
et+1,t = yt+1 – yt+1,t = A0ut+1.7 This has the 
covariance matrix E (et+1,te/prime
t+1,t) = A0A/prime
0, 
whereby, according to the defi  nition, vari-
1 A constant term and additional lags are dispensed 
with in order to present the methods as clearly as pos-
sible. When estimating the model, the number of lags 
is determined with the help of the Akaike information 
criterion.
2 A geometric series is used here to present the time 
series in the form of an infi  nite weighted sum of the 
error terms.
3 In Diebold and Yılmaz (2009), a Cholesky decompos-
ition (see Lütkepohl (2007)) is used to orthogonalise 
the error terms. However, other appropriate ap-
proaches exist, such as the PC algorithm described 
below.
4 From an economic perspective, a specifi  c order can-
not be assumed in the case of a VAR model consisting 
solely of exchange rates, either.
5 The difference between an observation and a point 
estimate calculated with the model is known as a fore-
cast error. It can be explained by individual innovations 
(ut). As the difference can assume positive or negative 
values, the forecast error variance is calculated by 
means of squaring. Breaking this down into the contri-
butions of innovations therefore yields general infor-
mation about the innovations that are signifi  cant to 
the development of individual variables.

The share of forecast error variance of the

where ck is the kth column of the identity 
matrix IK.
Calculated in this way, the shares of the in-
dividual variables as a proportion of the 
total forecast error variance of other vari-
ables can be directly interpreted as spill-
overs. This clearly demonstrates that both 
the simultaneous and the lagged relation-
ships between the variables play a role here. 
However, this approach has the disadvan-
tage that its results are strongly dependent 
on the underlying structure of contempor-
aneous exchange rate effects, and there-
fore the order of exchange rates in vector 
yt, on account of the Cholesky decompos-
ition. This means that the estimated con-
nectedness is also infl  uenced by the order 
of the variables. Contemporaneous causal 
effects based on such estimates can there-
fore only be meaningfully interpreted if in-
formation about the causal structure be-
tween the variables is available a priori. This 
is, however, generally not the case, espe-
cially where fi  nancial market variables such 
as exchange rates are concerned.
In such cases, then, it makes sense to use 
alternative methods for which the order of 
the variables is unimportant.8 Bettendorf 
and Heinlein (2019) applied such a method 
to the rates of change of the following cur-
rencies’ exchange rates9 against the pound: 
the Australian dollar (AUD), the Canadian 
dollar (CAD), the Swiss franc (CHF), the euro (EUR), the Japanese yen (JPY), the Norwe-
gian krone (NOK), the New Zealand dollar 
(NZD), the Swedish krona (SEK) and the US 
dollar (USD). The ECB’s euro reference ex-
change rates (daily data) were used as the 
data source for the period from the start of 
2010 to the end of 2017.
The causal structure of the contemporan-
eous effects is not predetermined in this 
case; rather, it is estimated with an algo-
rithm featured in the literature on machine 
learning, namely the PC algorithm, which is 
now used in many structural VAR analyses 
(see Kilian and Lütkepohl (2017)).10 On the 
basis of (partial) correlation tests, this algo-
rithm seeks to identify the causal structure 
between the residuals of the reduced form 
VAR model (/uni03F5.stst).11 If the causal structure of 
the residuals has been estimated, the matrix 
B0, which depicts the contemporaneous 
effects , can be defi  ned accordingly.12 Here, 
a zero restriction is set if no signifi  cant 
stimulus is simultaneously transmitted from 
one exchange rate to another. If the algo-
rithm recognises that no relationships exist 
between a suffi   cient number of variables, 
8 Diebold and Yılmaz (2014), for instance, use a gen-
eralised forecast error variance decomposition. This 
produces results which are independent of the se-
quence of the variables in the vector yt. However, it 
does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about 
contemporaneous causal effects.
9 In the present study, rates of change in the exchange 
rates are approximated by the fi  rst differences of the 
logarithmic exchange rates.
10 The PC algorithm derives its name from those of its 
developers, Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour.
11 Owing to the complexity of the algorithm, we 
forego a description here and refer only to Spirtes et 
al. (2001).
12 In this context, it is important that the algorithm 
detects a directed acyclic graph, or in other words, 
that no bidirectional, undirected or cyclic relationships 
exist between the residuals. The model would other-
wise not be identifi  ed. In cases where the PC algorithm 
can identify no such graphs, it makes sense to subject 
the reduced form VAR model to a bootstrapping pro-
cess and to save the results of the PC algorithm for 
each estimate. The direction of the relationships, 
which could not be clearly ascertained by the PC algo-
rithm originally, can ultimately be determined by their 
relative frequency in the bootstrapping process. This 
approach is based on that of Hoover and Demiralp 
(2003) and Demiralp et al. (2008).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

more than the single (K–1) ×K zero restric-
tion necessary to identify the model can be 
applied to the matrix B0, making the struc-
tural VAR model overidentifi  ed. Assuming 
that the restrictions are correct, this tends 
to produce a more detailed picture of con-
nectedness.
The algorithm yields the graphs shown on 
the right. It describes the structure of the 
contemporaneous effects between the re-
siduals of the estimate ( /uni03F5.stst). It can be seen 
that the US dollar and the Norwegian krone 
are both relatively independent of each 
other, and that they affect other currencies 
at the same time. By contrast, movements 
in the exchange rates of the Swiss franc and 
the New Zealand dollar in relation to the 
pound sterling are largely in response to 
price movements in other currencies. How-
ever, these are only the contemporaneous 
effects. In order to also take lagged infl  uen-
cing factors into account, a structural VAR 
model (SVAR model) is estimated using the 
obtained information on the contemporan-
eous causal structure of the residuals.13 The 
forecast error variance decomposition can 
also be calculated using the method de-
scribed above.
The results for a forecast horizon of ten 
days are presented in the table on p. 32.14 
The analysis suggests that, during the 
period under review, 37.8% of the total 
forecast error variance determined using 
the model for all nine observed exchange 
rates was explained by foreign shocks, i.e. 
spillover effects. This share corresponds to 
the sum of the entries on the off- diagonals 
divided by the total share of the nine vari-
ables (900%).
In light of all the uncertainty surrounding 
such econometric analyses, it can be said 
that the results confi  rm the assessment 
already  derived from an examination of the 
contemporaneous causalities alone. Over 
the review period, the US dollar and the Norwegian krone in particular were rela-
tively independent of infl  uences from 
abroad, looking at the calculations based 
on their exchange rates against the pound, 
but they had a comparatively strong impact 
on other currencies. The infl  uence of the US 
dollar on the Japanese yen and the Can-
adian dollar was particularly strong. The 
Norwegian krone had a relatively strong in-
fl  uence on considerably more currencies, 
but chiefl  y the Swedish krona and the euro. 
The Swiss franc and the New Zealand dollar, 
by contrast, barely infl  uenced other curren-
cies. Exchange rate movements of the euro 
were infl  uenced not only by the US dollar, 
but also by the Norwegian krone and the 
Swedish krona. The euro itself infl  uenced, in 
particular, the Swiss franc, which was prob-
ably due to the temporary introduction of a 
minimum exchange rate against the euro 
by the Swiss National Bank.
The comparatively strong infl  uence of the 
Norwegian krone on other currencies is a 
surprising fi  nding. These spillover effects 
13 If the causal structure is known, the model can be 
estimated on an equation- by- equation basis using the 
method of least squares.
14 The forecast horizon of ten days is customary in the 
literature (see, for example, Diebold and Yılmaz (2009, 
2014)). Here it is assumed that fi  nancial market shocks 
are processed no later than ten days after the event.Estimated causal structure of the

could be due to a commodity factor im-
pacting on different currencies. This may 
also affect currencies that are not classifi  ed 
as commodity currencies. Similarly, the es-
tablished impact of the Swedish krona on 
the euro may ultimately be a Norwegian 
krone- based secondary effect.
The results of the estimation can be used to 
group the currencies under review into cur-
rency blocs with the aid of a cluster analy-
sis. A currency bloc is defi  ned in such a way 
that it includes only those currencies that 
are relatively closely connected to each 
other.15 In contrast to the approach used in 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2012), only the rela-
tionships estimated from the rates of 
change in the exchange rates in the model 
are taken into account.16 The results sug-
gest that the observed currencies can be 
divided into three blocs: commodity curren-
cies, comprising the Australian dollar, the 
Canadian dollar and the New Zealand dol-
lar; a bloc of European currencies, namely 
the euro, the Norwegian krone and the 
Swedish krona; and a bloc of safe haven 
currencies and carry trade fi  nancing curren-
cies comprising the Swiss franc, the US dol-
lar and the yen. The distinction between 
these blocs can also be seen in relation to 
events which had a signifi  cant infl  uence on 
the pound sterling. While the pound depre-
ciated against all major currencies in the fi  rst two weeks following the referendum 
on the United Kingdom remaining in the 
European Union, for example, it depreci-
ated by very similar amounts against the 
currencies within each individual bloc.17
This approach is not above criticism.18 For 
instance, when examining the results, it 
must be borne in mind that in the absence 
of any theoretical specifi  cations, the shocks 
are identifi  ed using empirical tests alone (at 
a signifi  cance level of 10%, in this case). 
Amongst other things, therefore, there is a 
risk that the null hypothesis will (errone-
ously) not be rejected. Consequently, under 
the null hypothesis, the model is not neces-
sarily correct. Furthermore, Kilian and Lüt-
kepohl (2017) criticise this approach as 
being ill- suited to revealing economically 
signifi  cant structures. However, this criti-
cism is less relevant to the approach pre-
sented here, as only a general exchange

(2008), which is commonly used in the literature, and 
the proposed extension of modularity for directed 
graphs in Dugué und Perez (2015) were used to 
achieve this.
16 Alternatively, currency blocs can be obtained from 
the data on de facto exchange rate regimes provided 
by the International Monetary Fund; see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2012) and Fischer (2016).
17 However, the bloc of safe haven currencies and 
carry trade fi  nancing currencies is an exception in this 
case.

– Exchange rates also show parallel movements 
when two currencies happen to be influ -
enced by domestic stimuli which are inde -
pendent of one another, but cause unidirec -
tional exchange rate movements. It is not 
usually possible to provide solid evidence of 
such a phenomenon. However, it is possible 
that this was the case in the summer of 2018, 
when the Turkish lira was weakened by trade 
disputes, inter alia, and the South African 
rand by uncertainty regarding land owner -
ship. Naturally, there is no question of these 
cases being attributable to spillover effects .
– Spillover effects involve one currency having 
a real systematic impact on another. Here, 
the cause of the co- movement may origin -
ate in one of the two currency areas in ques -
tion (spilling over from one to the other). 
However, it may also stem from events in 
third countries that spill over to the two cur -
rencies being observed. A similar situation 
occurs when foreign exchange market par -ticipants attribute a shared characteristic 
relating  to foreign exchange investments to 
several currency areas. One example of this 
would be a currency area whose main char -
acteristic is that it exports commodities. The 
currencies of these countries would thus 
tend to respond in similar ways to changes 
in commodities prices. It is not always pos -
sible to separate spillover effects from simi -
larities because the underlying cause of a 
change in commodities prices, for example, 
could be attributable to a country- specific 
event whose economic effects spread to 
other countries and exchange rates. Spill -
over effects  and similarities are usually the 
focus of economic, but also academic, inter -
est. This is because they are typically respon -
sible when the exchange rate of a currency 
shifts vis- à- vis a number of other currencies 
as a result of external factors.
Spillover effects between exchange rates can 
be triggered by a variety of economic phenom -Coincidences
Spillover effects

without it being split into economically in-
terpretable components. This approach 
merely identifi  es empirical causalities be-
tween the exchange rates without trying to 
interpret them. Simulations also show that 
in spite of potential distortions, such rela-
tionships are often estimated considerably 
more accurately than when using the 
methods hitherto employed.19

ena. To be able to explain them, it makes sense 
to first provide a brief overview of the key fac -
tors determining exchange rates. Following on 
from this, the causes of spillover effects be -
tween exchange rates can then be deduced.
In the medium to long term, differences be -
tween price movements in individual countries 
play an important role in determining exchange 
rates (purchasing power parity theory). If prices 
in one country increase comparatively slowly, 
demand for the goods this country supplies 
– which are now cheap in relative terms – goes 
up, as does demand for its currency. The cur -
rency in question tends to appreciate. It should 
be noted, however, that a corresponding ad -
justment process can take a long time. In the 
short term, especially where inflation differen -
tials are comparatively low, the opposite effect 
can often be seen. If a surprisingly low inflation 
rate is published for a currency area, its cur -
rency initially tends to depreciate because mar -
ket participants then see a greater likelihood of 
domestic monetary policy being eased.
According to the theory of uncovered interest 
parity, an unexpected domestic interest rate cut 
leads, all else being equal, to a depreciation of 
the local currency because rational investors 
adjust their portfolios towards investments that 
promise higher returns.14 Similar effects on the 
exchange rate are posited for an expansion of 
the money supply or quantitative easing of 
monetary policy. All other things being equal, a 
rise in domestic real income ultimately increases 
currency demand, thus leading to an appreci -
ation of the relevant currency.
Of course, in many cases, it is not variations in 
the actual determinants themselves that lead 
to an adjustment in the exchange rate. Instead, 
exchange rates tend to react as soon as indica -
tors lead market participants to change their 
expectations of the determinants. Moreover, 
the causes of the changes in the determinants 
are not necessarily to be found in the observed 
currency areas themselves. Global risks or 
changes in third countries, for instance, can also influence these determinants.15 For ex -
ample, an increase in global risk perception 
often sees market participants transfer capital 
to “safe haven” countries such as the United 
States or Switzerland. The US dollar and the 
Swiss franc tend to appreciate as a result of 
these capital flows.
The following section now presents channels 
via which unidirectional movements in the 
above- described determinants of exchange 
rates, and hence spillover effects, may take 
place.
One classic transmission channel is the inter -
national trade in goods and services. Inter -
national trade links make it easier for economic 
cycles to spill over to other countries. Take, for 
example, an economic crisis that is initially 
limited to one country and whose effects in -
clude a decline in real incomes and lower ag -
gregate demand.16 Not only would this tend to 
lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency, 
but also to a reduction in imports of goods 
from other countries. As a result, the country’s 
major trading partners would also see a decline 
in aggregate demand and thus a reduction in 
income. In turn, the currencies of the countries 
indirectly affected would also tend to depreci -
ate. In this case, the collective depreciation of 
the currencies would reflect the intensity of the 
trade links between the countries involved.Spillover

14 Empirical evidence for uncovered interest parity, how -
ever, is not very strong (see, for example, Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2005) or Chinn (2006)). In contrast to the interest 
rate parity theory, the monetary model of exchange rate 
determinants argues that rising interest rates increase the 
propensity to save and reduce demand for currency for 
transaction purposes. This causes the domestic currency to 
depreciate.
15 See Bettendorf (2019).
16 According to the monetary model of exchange rate 
deter mination, lower real income leads to reduced demand 
for currency. If the money supply were to stay the same, 
this would lead to a higher (goods) price level. As a result, 
the domestic currency depreciates according to the pur -
chasing power parity theory. It should be noted that this 
model only describes the long term, in which prices are 
usually assumed to be flexible. Nonetheless, in the short 
term, too, international investors tend to move their funds 
away from countries that are starting to show signs of an 
economic downturn. This then also tends to be accompan -
ied by a depreciation in the short term.Deutsche Bundesbank

The international financial markets represent 
another transmission channel. For example, if 
close financial links exist, both domestic and 
foreign investors will be affected by asset price 
losses in a particular country. As a consequence, 
negative wealth effects could unfold in both 
countries.17 Lower demand for goods would re -
duce the gross domestic product of both coun -
tries. A historical example of spillover effects via 
international financial markets is the financial 
crisis of 2008. Credit defaults in the United 
States caused both US and foreign banks signifi -
cant losses. Some of these foreign banks had 
purchased securitised loans in the United States 
and were thus directly affected by the credit de -
faults and asset price losses there. This was 
among the factors that caused lending to de -
cline in several countries simultaneously and the 
crisis to spread internationally. Ultimately, the 
currencies of countries hit harder by the crisis 
would be expected to depreciate against the 
currencies of those countries that were less 
strongly affected. In this example, the degree of 
international financial inter  connectedness plays 
a crucial role. As a result of the spillover de -
scribed above, parallel movements would be -
come apparent in the exchange rates of coun -
tries that tend to have close financial ties with 
the country in which the crisis originated.18
Market participants’ expectations represent a 
further transmission channel. These expect -
ations can affect the exchange rates as de -
scribed above, even if their usual determinants 
remain unchanged. If said expectations relate 
to several different currency areas, for example 
because they are deemed to have shared char -
acteristics, this can lead directly to parallel 
movements. Generally speaking, expectations 
can apply to all determining factors such as the 
interest rate differential, inflation differentials 
or even common risks (risks for emerging mar -
ket economies).
The described spillover effects and similarities 
between currency areas presumably also played 
a part in the co- movement of the exchange 
rates within the currency blocs identified. The relatively strong trade and financial links be -
tween the euro area and the Scandinavian 
countries could have an important bearing on 
the clear connections between the euro, the 
Norwegian krone and the Swedish krona. 
These links can transmit changes in the deter -
minants of the exchange rates, thus resulting in 
parallel movements. A second bloc containing 
safe haven currencies and carry trade financing 
currencies consists of the Swiss franc, the Jap -
anese yen and the US dollar. As described 
above, these countries’ currencies are influ -
enced in part by market participants’ expect -
ations of global risk, which can lead to parallel 
movements in their rates. The third bloc com -
prises the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar 
and the New Zealand dollar. The currencies of 
commodity exporting countries often respond 
in similar ways because these countries have 
similar trade patterns.
Conclusion
Parallel exchange rate developments can take 
place due to a range of factors. If, say, the 
currency  of one country is pegged to that of 
another  as a result of a fixed exchange rate 
regime  , the exchange rates of both currencies 
vis- à- vis a third currency will, of course, be very 
similar over time. But even without a fixed re -
gime, systematic relationships between differ -
ent exchange rates are apparent. Among the 
major currencies of the advanced economies, 
an empirical analysis identifies three blocs 
which show evidence of systematic parallel ex -
change rate movements since 2010. The mech -
anisms that bring about such co- movement in 
flexible exchange rates are many and varied. In 
the case of the blocs identified in the analysis, 
however, there are indications that important 
factors include the intensity of trade links and 
financial ties, patterns of trade, and expect -
ations regarding economic policy risks.… international

Crypto tokens in payments and securities 
settlement
For some ten years now, it has been possible, using blockchain technology, to transfer digitally 
defined units of value, such as Bitcoin, as “crypto tokens” electronically within a network via a 
cryptographic process that leaves a distinct traceable record without the involvement of inter -
mediaries. The financial sector believes that blockchain technology has the potential to carry out 
the entire process of settling financial transactions on the basis of digitised values. Existing units 
of value, such as gold or securities, could be represented by a digitally generated token and 
made digitally transferable (tokenisation).
Financial service providers and technology companies are currently stepping up their efforts to 
develop tokens for payment purposes that have a stable value. The effectiveness of most of the 
crypto tokens currently used for payments is primarily limited by the relatively large fluctuations 
in their value. However, with the progressive development and use of stablecoins, which are com -
paratively stable in value, crypto tokens demonstrate that they possess the potential for greater 
use in transactions. These also include the plans published recently by a consortium of large plat -
form providers such as Facebook as well as international payment service providers under the 
name “Libra”, according to which blockchain technology would be used to create globally avail -
able stablecoins. Whether and to what extent stablecoins will be used in the future as a means 
of payment remains to be seen. If stablecoin projects of this size were to quickly play a significant 
role in payment transactions, this could have a noticeable and lasting impact on the financial 
system and central banks. In light of this, policymakers and academics have been discussing from 
various angles whether central banks should issue digital central bank money to the general pub -
lic. From today’s perspective, however, the Bundesbank does not see a need for digital central 
bank money to be made available to non- banks.
In the area of securities settlement, the financial sector also assumes that the use of blockchain 
technology will enable transactions to be settled more efficiently. While German securities law 
currently does not permit the purely digital issuance or transfer of values, it is expected that the 
legal situation will be revised and that current settlement processes and structures will evolve fur -
ther.
From the Bundesbank’s perspective, efforts to tokenise assets using blockchain technology are to 
be welcomed in principle on account of the attendant impetus for innovation and efficiency. The 
Bundesbank will continue to monitor current developments closely. The guiding principle of its 
assessment will be to ensure that payment systems remain secure and efficient and that its other 
statutory objectives, primarily monetary and financial stability, are not compromised.Deutsche Bundesbank

Tokens as catalysts of 
digitalisation 
Digitalisation impacts on payments and secur -
ities settlement in particular. The conversion of 
analogue processes, with their many manual 
operating steps and numerous system discon -
tinuities, into digital, automated processes is 
especially important in high- volume payment 
transactions. Major advances have been 
achieved on this front since the 1980s thanks 
to the standardisation, harmonisation and 
automation of processes. In recent years, an 
entirely new dynamic has unfolded, driven, 
inter alia, by new technologies and the emer -
gence of digital ecosystems, especially in the 
form of communication platforms and in e-  
commerce. This dynamic means that many of 
the IT systems used by financial service pro -
viders have to be overhauled.
For a number of years, the financial sector has 
been expecting digital tokens in conjunction 
with distributed ledger technology (DLT)1 to 
transform processes and structures in payment 
and securities settlement systems. While the 
vast majority of payment transactions and se -
curities settlement transactions are currently al -
ready cleared electronically, this nevertheless 
requires accounts or securities deposit accounts 
held at banks or other central intermediaries. If 
values are to be transferred, these central en -
tities must be involved in order for a booking to 
be made on the corresponding accounts. The 
possibility of settling digital assets more and 
more decentrally in the form of tokens is in -
tended to speed up the execution of many 
transactions, reduce the costs of the associated 
processes and open up new areas of business. 
The corresponding gains in efficiency will ma -
terialise particularly wherever a large number of 
participants in a network interact with each 
other and where there are frequent exchanges 
between the parties involved, such as in pay -
ment systems or on trading platforms. Tokens 
are digital units that are transferable and that 
can take on a great number of functions in a 
network. In order to transfer the tokens, the participants interact with each other directly via 
technical protocols in a peer- to- peer network. 
The Bitcoin network, for instance, functions as 
an independent payment system between con -
nected computers. In the meantime, however, 
both blockchain technology and the concepts 
and business models behind digital tokens have 
seen noticeable progress.
Digital tokens can be generated and trans -
ferred both in public permissionless networks 
and in private, closed networks. Since the 
transfers or transactions within a network are 
carried out using a technical protocol based on 
cryptographic procedures, this type of token 
will be referred to below as “crypto tokens”. 
The aim is to fully dematerialise means of pay -
ment and assets in order to transfer them be -
tween participants in the network securely and 
immediately.
Crypto tokens and their 
ecosystem 
Crypto tokens were initially known as a substi -
tute means of payment in public, decentralised 
networks on the internet. In recent years, they 
have increasingly been used as an object of 
speculation, giving rise to a large number of 
centralised and decentralised trading platforms. 
In the meantime, a number of traditional finan -
cial actors are now also offering products and 
services for publicly accessible crypto tokens. 
Owing to the use of unregulated crypto trading 
platforms and, in some cases, widely varying 
terminology, published statistics on the num -
ber, value and volume of existing crypto tokens 
should be interpreted with caution. The oft-  
cited source coinmarketcap.com lists over 
2,000 different crypto tokens, with a market Digitalisation

1 The term “blockchain”, or more generally “distributed 
ledger” (DL), is normally used to describe a database shared 
across a network which gives participants joint rights to 
write, read and store entries to the ledger. The most com -
mon DLT applications are based on blockchain technology, 
which has proven to be particularly useful for recording 
transaction histories; see also Deutsche Bundesbank

capitalisation of around US$335 billion.2 Bit-
coin alone accounted for more than half of this 
figure. Most of the crypto tokens listed are of 
little importance in terms of their value, with 
several hundred of them reporting a daily turn -
over of less than US$10,000. Even the narrow 
monetary aggregate for the euro area, M1 
(cash in circulation plus sight deposits of non-  
banks), is more than 25 times the value of all 
crypto tokens.3
In the public debate, crypto tokens are gener -
ally divided into three categories for the sake of 
simplicity:4
– Payment tokens: These fulfil a payment 
function. Aside from this, they have little or 
no other function.
– Security tokens: Users have claims on assets 
arising from participation or contractual 
rights, similar to shares and bonds.
– Utility tokens: They can be used in the is-
suer’s network to purchase goods and ser -
vices.
In practice, it is often difficult to classify tokens 
distinctly into one of the three categories.
Development of the market 
environment
Crypto tokens arose and became known as pri -
vately generated digital tokens that can be 
transferred as a substitute mean of payment in 
publicly accessible peer- to- peer networks in a 
largely anonymous manner and without any 
intermediaries. On the whole, they are not 
used as means of payment predominantly due 
to their strong price fluctuations compared 
with legal tender as well as the lack of stability 
mechanisms on the part of an issuer or an an -
choring in the real economy. At the turn of 
2017-18, Bitcoin registered a multiplication of 
its value within a few weeks, as did many copy -
cat coins. This boom was followed by a value adjustment that lasted several months. The 
value trajectory that was observed during this 
period strongly resembled the pattern of histor -
ical speculative bubbles5 and provided an enor -
mous boost to the prominence of crypto 
tokens, especially among speculative invest -
ors.6
In spring 2018, this development was followed 
by strong growth in the number of newly is -
sued crypto tokens via “Initial Coin Offerings” 
(ICOs). These initiatives are a kind of crowd -
funding where investors purchase newly issued 
crypto tokens for money or other crypto tokens 
in order to fund the development of products, 
typically software. This type of approach is es -
pecially interesting for newer start- up com -
panies that are not readily able to cover their 
capital requirements via bank loans or the trad -
itional capital market. The design of ICOs and 
particularly the rights and obligations associ -
ated with the issued crypto tokens vary consid -
erably: in some cases, investors can use crypto 
tokens to purchase the rights of use to prod -
ucts that are often still in development, while in 
other cases they are looking at the prospect of 
real participation rights. Frequently, however, 
they are simply crypto tokens whose value 
could rise.
In the past, the rapidly growing ICO market, 
utilised as a form of direct finance, was struc -
turally susceptible to abuse and fraud, how -
ever.7 White papers that described the projects 
were sometimes formulated so vaguely that in 
many cases it was difficult to make a realistic 
assessment of the market opportunities.8 
Nevertheless, even these ICOs were in demand: 
blockchain or DLT were considered key future 
technologies that were expected to change 
many market structures. A large number of Payment tokens,

invest ors wished to have a share in the returns 
of seemingly promising developments.
In general, the issuers of the tokens placed on 
the market via ICOs determine themselves 
which information they disclose. Investors are 
not sufficiently able to verify this information. 
Since many of the ICOs initiated so far are ini -
tiatives that operate outside of the relevant 
regulatory provisions and jurisdictions, invest -
ors are not protected by consumer protection 
regulations.9
Centralised trading platforms
The formation of a market for crypto tokens 
has entailed the increasing appearance of cen -
tralised and decentralised internet- based crypto 
trading platforms. Centralised trading platforms 
enable the purchase and sale of various crypto 
tokens against currencies issued by central 
banks. Similarly, most platforms allow different 
crypto tokens to be traded for one another. 
The most liquid crypto tokens on these trading 
platforms currently include Bitcoin, Ether and 
the Ripple token. Some trading platform oper -
ators additionally offer a significantly broader 
range of less liquid crypto tokens. The trading 
volume on the largest crypto trading platforms 
varies widely. Several studies in the past have 
also raised doubts regarding the reported trad -
ing volumes.10 After some trading platforms 
pulled out of countries such as China due to 
stronger regulation, they are now chiefly lo -
cated in Malta, South Korea, Singapore, Hong 
Kong and the United States. According to pub -
licly available information, these include 
Binance (Malta, formerly China and Japan), 
OKEx (Malta), Coinbase (United States), HitBTC 
(Hong Kong), Huobi (Singapore, previously 
China, with additional locations in Hong Kong, 
South Korea, Japan and the United States), Up -
bit (South Korea) and Bitfinex (British Virgin Is -
lands).11
The functioning, governance, transparency, 
scope and quality of services of the various centralised trading platforms can vary substan -
tially. A key distinctive feature is the role of the 
platform operator in the trading of crypto 
tokens: while some providers merely provide 
the platform itself, on which customers can 
place their purchase and sales bids and carry 
them out against each other, other providers 
act as intermediaries by acting themselves as 
buyers or sellers to their customers. Moreover, 
the platforms can also play different roles re -
garding the custody of crypto tokens. Platform 
operators can therefore either custody the 
tokens on behalf of their customers (“custodial 
exchanges”) or they can leave the custody of 
the token to the customer (“non-  custodial ex -
changes”).12 Since crypto tokens exist purely in 
digital form, a private key is required to transfer 
crypto tokens. This key has a function similar to 
a password and is only known to the owner. If 
the platform assumes the custody of crypto 
tokens, it acts as a trustee. It then holds the 
private key, which entitles its owner to transfer 
the crypto tokens in the original peer- to- peer 
network, on behalf of the customer. In this re -
spect, the situation is comparable to online 
banking or an online securities deposit account. 
On the other hand, if customers keep their pri -
vate key themselves, they alone are able to 
transfer the crypto tokens and are solely re -
sponsible for safeguarding the key.
Operators of centralised trading platforms are 
private companies that are sometimes not sub -
ject or only partially subject to financial regula -
tion and supervisory regimes depending on the 
country of residence and business model. 
Therefore, in some cases, there are only very 
few or even no requirements for risk manage -
ment, IT security and consumer protection. In 
addition, these platforms are typically relatively Market infra -

new enterprises or start- ups whose security 
policies are often still in their early stages of 
development and less tried- and- tested.13 These 
trading platforms have experienced attacks by 
cybercriminals on several occasions due to in -
sufficient security precautions.14
Besides cyber- attacks, cases of fraud and loss 
events owing to the operator’s poor govern -
ance structures have frequently been observed 
in recent years. In some cases, it can be as -
sumed that the market was targeted and ma -
nipulated in order to achieve profits illicitly.15 
Furthermore, some providers have been criti -
cised for forgoing know- your- customer (KYC) 
checks required for banking business. Waiving 
the requirement to establish customers’ iden -
tities opens the door to anonymous or pseud -
onymous participation in the network, mean -
ing that illicit transactions such as money laun -
dering and terrorist financing can be concealed. 
That said, there are indications in the sector of 
a trend towards the clear identification of cus -
tomers, not least to build up trusting customer 
relationships and to achieve a broader cus -
tomer base in the financial market.
Decentralised trading 
platforms 
Besides centralised trading platforms, an in -
creasing number of decentralised trading plat -
forms (also known as “decentralised ex -
changes”) have been set up recently; on these 
trading platforms, users can exchange crypto 
tokens, in some cases entirely without inter -
mediaries. The transaction takes place directly 
between the seller and the buyer and is cleared 
automatically by a program code (smart con -
tract) developed specifically for that purpose.16 
However, only a very small number of decen -
tralised exchanges operate exclusively on 
blockchain technology. As the matching of bids 
on the blockchain is very time- consuming and 
expensive, special websites are employed to 
match supply and demand via a trading book.In addition to the centralised or decentralised 
exchanges, the traditional financial sector is 
also gradually developing its own growing 
range of crypto token services, with some trad -
itional actors offering custodial services for 
crypto tokens. Others are basing their index or 
derivative products on crypto tokens, enabling 
institutional and private investors to speculate 
on the prices of individual or multiple crypto 
tokens without having to hold them directly.
To sum up, although a diverse infrastructure for 
trading and storing crypto tokens has emerged 
in recent years, many of the crypto tokens that 
have been around for longer, such as Bitcoin, 
have, on the whole, not proven to be stable in 
terms of their value compared with currencies 
issued by central banks. As a result, they have 
not been able to establish themselves as a gen -
eral means of payment, nor are they suited to 
being a store of value. Instead, they are a niche 
product used predominantly by speculative in -
vestors. Furthermore, the tokens and the infra -
structure required for their trade and storage 
are often not subject to financial market regu -
lation. There are also indications that crypto 
tokens are being used for illicit transactions.
Stablecoins
In response to the sharp price volatility of many 
existing crypto tokens, there have been at -
tempts for some time now to develop crypto 
tokens that are stable in value. Stablecoins are 
crypto tokens whose value is often pegged to 
an existing currency (or basket of currencies) 
and backed by matching collateral.17 Stable -
coins are therefore not payment tokens which 
have an inherently stable value.Security flaws

17 As a general rule, there is no perfectly positive correl -
ation between the stablecoin and its respective reference 
currency, as the price of a stablecoin is additionally deter -
mined by fluctuations in supply and demand on digital 
trading platforms.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2019

Stablecoins have been receiving a particularly 
large amount of attention over the past few 
weeks as a result of the plan by Facebook and 
other large global players (collectively in the 
Libra Association) to establish a global payment 
system with stablecoins. In these cases, the sta -
blecoin is designed for settling payments in 
digital networks or infrastructures, such as 
messenger services. So far, stablecoins have 
been used mainly as a unit of account or a 
vehicle  currency for trading between different 
crypto tokens, especially for arbitrage trading 
between different trading platforms.18
Tokens having a stable value encourages their 
use for payments. In the simplest case, the 
value of the token can be pegged to the value 
or price of an existing asset outside the net -
work, such as a currency issued by a central 
bank or a security. What is crucial for their sta -
bility is how stable the value of the underlying 
collateral is and how legally binding any claim 
to convertibility is.19
Fundamentally, there are two different ap -
proaches to maintaining the stability of the 
stable coin’s value: backing with off- chain or 
on- chain collateral and utilising algorithms to 
control  the supply of tokens (see the chart on 
p. 45).
Backing with off- chain 
collateral 
Off- chain collateral refers to values that are not 
stored on a blockchain in digital form, but 
stored in a traditional way. These mainly consist 
of claims in currencies issued by central banks, 
such as secured account balances at a bank or 
securities. However, off- chain collateral may 
also take the form of commodities, such as 
gold. Many initiatives, some of which have 
been launched by established companies, are 
aimed at a stablecoin backed by a local cur -
rency. The remarks below therefore mainly re -
late to this approach.The stablecoin issuer assures the buyer that the 
issuer will hold the stablecoin’s equivalent value 
in the respective collateral currency or in 
equivalent collateral assets. Redemption of the 
stablecoin in question in currency is often not 
guaranteed, however. The holder has no legally 
enforceable entitlement to reimbursement. In 
this respect, the situation is different from that 
concerning a bank deposit, which constitutes a 
legally enforceable claim against the bank in 
question (for example, payment in cash). How -
ever, it is also conceivable for the provider to 
hold the posted collateral as a trustee for the 
users. As a general rule, users of stablecoins 
incur credit risk if the provider is insolvent upon 
redemption. Liquidity risk may arise if, for ex -
ample, the relevant collateral cannot be liquid -
ated at short notice. It should also be noted 
that the nature of the assets used as collateral 
for individual stablecoins may vary widely.
If the collateral is in the form of liquid deposits 
held with commercial banks, there remains an 
inherent credit risk. Backing with central bank 
money would not have these disadvantages, 
but would not eliminate a priori the credit risk 
stemming from the collateralising entity. There 
would have to be specific legal arrangements 
for this, say, in the form of trusteeship agree -
ments that would safeguard the collateralising 
character for the stablecoin in the event of the 
collateralising entity becoming insolvent.
At the present stage, it is very difficult to gauge 
how widely and how quickly stablecoins will 
come into use in the future and what repercus -
sions this would have for the economy and the 
financial system, particularly as the extent and 
speed both depend on the concrete implemen -
tation. In highly developed economic areas

rencies, the market potential of stablecoins as a … and could be

19 If the backing collateral is a currency basket, the holder 
always bears an additional exchange rate risk if the token is 
to be exchanged for US dollar or euro, for example. This 
risk essentially depends on the share of the respective cur -
rency in the overall basket.Deutsche Bundesbank

means of payment is likely to be modest given 
the then uncertain additional benefit. However, 
globally functioning, low- cost settlement with 
a relatively stable token which is issued and 
credibly collateralised by a consortium of sev -
eral large and solvent companies might have 
the potential to displace some currencies, espe -
cially those which are less stable in value, to a 
certain extent.
Stablecoins actually achieving large volumes 
and being backed by baskets of currencies 
might have a macroeconomic impact, say, 
owing to shifts in exchange rate relationships. 
This is conceivable, for example, if a currency 
were to have a larger share in the currency bas -
ket than warranted by its use in the inter -
national trade of goods and services or for the 
portfolio selection of international reserve cur -
rencies. In this scenario, far- reaching effects 
could also occur for the existing players in the 
respective financial system if stablecoins were 
to replace giro money as a means of payment, 
thus reducing banks’ earnings in the field of 
payments. Although banks are already exposed 
to increased competition in payments from 
new providers, this has been concentrated so 
far on the “customer interface”, while actual 
payment settlement still takes place on bank 
accounts. Banks’ traditional business models 
would possibly come under pressure if sight 
deposits were to become less attractive com -
pared with holding tokens, resulting in port -
folio shifts into longer- term forms of invest -
ment. This might lead to a change in, for ex -
ample, the refinancing conditions for lending 
and, indirectly, also in the transmission of mon -
etary policy impulses.20 In particular, if such 
shifts were to happen abruptly, effects on 
finan cial stability could not be ruled out. Over 
the longer term, once businesses and con -
sumers have adjusted to it, it is likely that the 
financial system will have adapted to the more 
widespread use of stablecoins. Much the same 
applies to any monetary policy implications of 
the highlighted developments. As long as there 
is still a sufficient demand for central bank 
money, monetary policymakers will still be in a position to achieve their aims effectively. What 
also has to be taken into account in a financial 
system changed by stablecoins is that demand 
for tokens could become very volatile in the 
event of individual stablecoin issuers experien -
cing economic difficulties or threats to their 
reputation.
Stablecoins also harbour opportunities in the 
form of aggregate welfare gains, say, if they 
lower the still very high fees for some cross-  
border transfers.21 Particularly stablecoins that 
are broadly or even globally widely accepted 
could indeed have implications for some trad -
itional tasks of the central bank, such as safe -
guarding the effective transmission of monet -
ary policy, ensuring stable payments, and finan -
cial stability. The fulfilment of statutory central 
bank tasks must take priority over private sec -
tor business interests, however. If the sovereign 
fulfilment of the central banks’ mandate were 
to be jeopardised by stablecoins in the future, 
the statutory and regulatory frameworks would 
have to be adapted accordingly. Owing to the 
potentially global dimension of tokenisation 
and its settlement infrastructures, close cooper -
ation between regulators and central banks is 
indispensable for ensuring a stable financial Stablecoins

system and similar competitive conditions inter -
nationally without the possibility of regulatory 
arbitrage.
Backing with on- chain 
collateral 
A further option is to back stablecoins with on- 
chain collateral. In this system, collateral, such 
as existing crypto tokens, is deposited on a 
blockchain. As existing crypto tokens do not 
have an intrinsic stable value, additional stabil -
ising measures are generally put in place. These 
include, inter alia, incentives for active manage -
ment of the collateral as well as the over-  
collateralisation of the respective stablecoin. 
The stabilising mechanisms envisaged for this 
might act only with a time lag, however. Fur -
thermore, liquidity shortages in the crypto 
token used as collateral as well as the generally 
very volatile market environment can lead to 
insufficient collateralisation. Price stability in re -
lation to a reference currency can thus, in prin -
ciple, be ensured only approximately in the 
case of crypto tokens with on- chain collateral. 
There is still the risk of a downward spiral given 
a fall in the price of the crypto token used as 
collateral.
Algorithm- controlled supply
In contrast to the two variants that have al -
ready been described, stablecoins whose sup -
ply is algorithm- controlled are not backed by 
traditional or digital assets. Instead, the supply 
is intended to be controlled variably by the rele -
vant blockchain protocol or an individual smart 
contract. The idea behind this is that of an al -
gorithmic issuing agency that is supposed to 
manage the token supply automatically, so that 
a stable exchange rate to a selected benchmark 
(e.g. the US dollar or the euro) is ensured.22 
One of the unresolved issues here is how a fall 
in the price of the token could be prevented in 
the event of a speculative attack or a crisis. In 
practice, stablecoins with an algorithmically controlled supply have not been used on a not -
able scale so far.
Tokenisation in the 
settlement  of payment 
transactions 
Tokenisation allows for extensive digitalisation 
in the settlement of payment transactions so 
that, in several cases, confirmations and recon -
ciliation processes can be carried out more 
quickly and some steps in the process chain 
can even be omitted entirely. As a result, bene -
fits can be expected particularly for complex, 
labour- sharing processes. In the financial sec -
tor, this primarily affects securities settlement, 
but also cross- border payments.23 By contrast, 
the national payment systems in many coun -
tries have already attained a high level of effi -
ciency. In addition, there is a perceptible global 
trend towards introducing real- time retail pay -
ment systems, which make it possible to settle 
payments instantly and at any time via bank 
accounts .
Until now, cross- border payments between 
banks have been settled via an international 
network of bilateral accounts (correspondent 
banking). In a number of cases, lines of credit 
are provided in order to settle payments; trust 
between the counterparties in correspondent 
banking therefore plays a key role. In some 
cases, there exist inefficiencies that can result 
from the long settlement chains and lack of 
standardisation, which are then reflected in 
relatively high fees and long processing times 
compared to national payments. In addition, 
some regions have seen a decline in corres -
pondent banking relationships and tendencies 
towards consolidation in recent years.24

tial for optimisation in cross- border payments. 
Tokens can serve as a common medium of ex -
change within a network and thereby replace 
bilateral account management.25 Through to -
kenisation, counterparties can exchange values 
and securities across countries and currency 
areas on a uniform basis.26 The use of tokens in 
digital cross- border networks could enable 
those processes which, so far, have required 
manual intervention in some cases to be auto -
mated and carried out more efficiently. Further -
more, the use of tokens could be attractive for 
large, international providers if they integrate 
them into their cross- border platforms as a 
worldwide, user- friendly means of payment.
Trade finance also plays a major role in inter -
national payments. Alongside the use of digital 
tokens, an additional potential benefit is af -
forded by the use of smart contracts for simul -
taneously settling trading obligations. Using 
smart contracts, digitalised values are trans -
ferred on a blockchain – in a way that is verifi -
able and resistant to counterfeiting – depend -
ing on their documented progress in the pro -
cess. This means that smart contracts act as 
technological trustees which automatically for -
ward or return the funds entrusted to them 
upon the occurrence of certain events, such as 
the dispatch of goods. In a closed network 
with defined roles, the trade finance documen -
tation, which often consists of several thou -
sand pages nowadays, could be used in digital -
ised form.
For this purpose, a number of prerequisites 
must be fulfilled: the contracts used must be 
standardised, such as in the form of digital for -
mat templates; the rights of the individual 
counterparties must be defined in a legally 
binding manner; and a common platform must 
be used. The platform could be operated jointly 
by all or several of the participants and would 
thereby avoid the problem of the participants 
needing to agree on a central, trustworthy 
intermediary, which can sometimes be a diffi -
cult issue in an international context. As smart 
contracts do not create contracts but settle them, the contractual basis for cooperation be -
tween the participants using a common tech -
nology in a process chain must be prepared 
initially. By using a common network with 
standardised contracts, risks can be reduced 
and processes that have so far been largely 
manual can be simplified and accelerated. Uni -
form data storage within the network may be 
expected to provide additional benefits.
Improvements in cross- border payment trans -
actions should also be seen as a way of increas -
ing financial inclusion. These simplifications 
could allow for considerable welfare gains in 
some countries by facilitating people’s access 
to payment services. In a considerable number 
of countries,27 a significant portion of national 
income consists of transfers from emigrants 
back to their home country (remittances). In 
2018, remittances to low and middle- income 
countries amounted to around US$529 billion28 
and are at times associated with high transac -
tion costs. According to the World Bank, the 
costs were, on average, 7% of the transfer 
amount.29 This means there is a high potential 
saving that could be leveraged through the use 
of new technologies. In order to make full use 
of this potential, it would also have to be pos -
sible to use tokens in the recipient country, 
which would avoid the cumbersome process of 
exchanging them for cash. At the same time, 
the stringent regulatory standards –  for ex -
ample, with regard to anti- money laundering 
and counter- terrorist financing measures  – 
must be taken into account.Tokens could

Discussion about digital central  
bank money
Today, the vast majority of payment transac -
tions between non- banks are settled in com -
mercial bank money. Nevertheless, central bank 
money in the form of cash also continues to 
play an important role for payments in general. 
For this reason, following the emergence of 
crypto tokens, there was soon talk of issuing 
digital central bank money for non- banks – the 
“retail” variant – as a stable means of payment 
within DLT- based systems. However, such a 
connection is anything but compelling. As 
things stand today, this comprehensive variant 
of digital central bank money offers only minor 
perceptible benefits for payment settlement. 
Many use cases could be covered through the 
use of tokenised commercial bank money. If, 
for example, a token were to be issued by a 
commercial bank and could be exchanged for 
legal tender with that bank, this would consti -
tute digital commercial bank money, known 
from a regulatory perspective as electronic 
money (e- money).30 From the Bundesbank’s 
perspective, there is therefore no need to intro -
duce this comprehensive variant of digital cen -
tral bank money at the current juncture. Never -
theless, some central banks have begun to sys -
tematically investigate the possibility of issuing 
digital central bank money. Differences result 
based on the scenarios analysed and the mo -
tive.31
One motive for introducing digital central bank 
money could be to ensure the accessibility of 
the financial system and central bank money to 
the general public. In some countries, the de -
clining use of cash in payments has prompted a 
debate on whether households and enterprises 
need an electronic form of central bank money 
for payment settlement.32 In addition, it is 
being discussed whether it could become ne -
cessary to issue digital central bank money if 
private payment structures with significant 
market power were to evolve. In this context, a 
payment system with digital central bank 
money should ensure competition and access to the payment system for all consumers as 
well as guarantee the security of payment 
transactions in crisis situations through a pub -
licly provided service.
However, if digital central bank money were to 
be issued, far- reaching implications would have 
to be taken into consideration.33 Digital central 
bank money that would also be available to 
non- banks could, for example, be used as a 
substitute for commercial bank money. The fi -
nancing of commercial banks through (sight) 
deposits could be made more difficult or more 
expensive, which could also potentially have an 
impact on the credit supply.34 Irrespective of 
this, bank deposits would likely be subject to 
greater volatility, particularly during times of 
crisis or economic strain in the financial mar -
kets.
If digital central bank money were only to be 
used in a closed- loop system containing se -
lected participants for a limited purpose – the 
“wholesale” variant  – the consequences for 
monetary policy, bank stability and the financial 
system would be considerably less pronounced. 
The fact that commercial bank money harbours 
risks of insolvency and illiquidity plays a signifi -
cant role in banks’ payment settlement and in 
the cash settlement of financial market transac -
tions. At present, private actors’ access to ac -
counts at the central bank, and thus the possi -
bility of holding and transferring central bank 
funds, is largely confined to monetary financial 
institutions. The non- bank private sector gener -
ally only has access to central bank money in 
the form of cash. If these access criteria for 
central bank money were to remain unchanged, Digital central

amount of money (prepaid), represents a claim against the

34 Alternatively, banks would have to compensate for the 
loss of sight deposits, for example by attracting time de -
posits and savings or by issuing bank debt securities. How -
ever, these liabilities are regularly associated with higher 
funding costs.Deutsche Bundesbank

structural effects in the financial sector would 
be expected only to a limited extent. The 
ration ale behind establishing such a system 
would mainly be the expected gains in effi -
ciency achieved through DLT- based settlement.
In this context, market participants are also dis -
cussing stablecoins, which would be used to 
settle very large- value financial market transac -
tions. In order to minimise credit risks as far as 
possible, collateralisation in central bank money 
is under consideration in this regard. However, 
only a central bank’s liabilities can be non- cash 
central bank money. As a result, tokens issued 
by commercial banks or a group of commercial 
banks backed by central bank money would 
not be considered central bank money.
Settlement in central bank money could also be 
achieved by technically connecting DLT- based 
networks to existing payment systems. Existing 
payment systems, such as the TARGET2 real-  
time gross settlement system operated by the 
Eurosystem, would be used for the cash settle -
ment of transactions carried out on DLT- based 
platforms. In this case, the DLT would act as a 
messaging platform that triggers payments. 
This “trigger solution” would require the devel -
opment of a technical interface between DLT 
networks and payment systems, the creation of 
a legally binding, digitalised payment instruc -
tion, as well as the continuous provision of 
real- time settlement in RTGS systems by ex -
tending operating hours. However, the condi -
tions for accessing the systems, and thus cen -
tral bank money, would not need to be funda -
mentally changed.
Ideas and initiatives with regard to tokenisation 
may, in conjunction with innovative technolo -
gies, provide impetus for increased harmonisa -
tion and standardisation. Heterogeneous rules 
and standards are often responsible for com -
plex settlement structures. By establishing uni -
form standards, settlement can also be sped up 
within the existing structures and made more 
transparent. One example of this is the SWIFT 
Global Payments Innovation Initiative, which, under certain conditions, allows for same-  
business- day payments, payment tracking, and 
transparent processing fees in the field of inter -
national payments. In this regard, credit institu -
tions are falling back on the existing infrastruc -
ture, but the potential for optimisation is being 
fully exhausted through the implementation of 
uniform rules and improved procedures.35
Tokens in securities 
settlement 
Alongside the use of tokens in payment trans -
actions, there are especially high hopes for the 
use of tokenised securities. Conceptually, there 
is a distinction between digital representations 
of securities already issued through traditional 
channels, on the one hand, and securities that 
exist purely in digital form as tokens, on the 
other.
A sizeable number of market participants be -
lieve that significant efficiency gains in post-  
trade could be achieved through tokenisation 
in the future. Post- trade comprises the settle -
ment, custody and, optionally, clearing of se -
curities. In this area, the processing of securities 
transactions should also be simplified and ac -
celerated by the improved data quality and the 
omission of intermediaries. Ideally, it is ex -
pected that issuers and investors would be able 
to conclude transactions with each other dir -
ectly without intermediation by other partici -
pants, such as central securities depositories 
(CSDs) or custody banks. The long custody 
chains that are typical in securities business at 
present could then be shortened considerably. 
The resulting leaner processes in post- trade 
would likely lead to efficiency gains and cost 
savings.36 In addition, smart contracts are well 
suited to settling various corporate actions (e.g. 
coupon payments) in a more efficient way.

number of errors arising from the reconciliation 
process are likely to decrease as a result of 
common data storage.
One specific area that already features concrete 
use of tokens in the market is collateral man -
agement. Here, the focus is on what are known 
as “collateral baskets”, i.e. baskets of collateral 
of predefined quality that are used to collat -
eralise various transactions or to ensure compli -
ance with regulatory requirements. As an initial 
step, these collateral baskets can be formed 
using tokens.37 Employing DLT, these tokens 
can then be transferred between the counter -
parties involved virtually in real time. In particu -
lar, internationally active market participants 
whose securities are held at various locations 
could provide collateral in this way without the 
underlying individual securities having to be re -
peatedly moved along long custody chains. 
Utilising tokenised securities as collateral could 
allow residual frictions to be reduced. At the 
same time, the market is seeing strong demand 
for high-  quality liquid assets (HQLA).38 
Tokenisation- based market solutions currently 
in development are approaching this problem 
by enabling easy mobilisation of these secur -
ities without the need for cumbersome physical 
transfer.
While only mutual exchange of securities or 
collateral baskets is envisaged at present, ex -
changing securities tokens for commercial bank 
money or central bank money (delivery versus 
payment, or DvP) is also already under consid -
eration. DvP settlement links the transfer of se -
curities resulting from their purchase or sale or 
from a repo transaction to the transfer of com -
mercial bank money or central bank money. 
Here, securities are only delivered once the cor -
responding transfer of money has occurred, 
and vice versa. The idea behind such DvP settle -
ment is to eliminate advance delivery risk; in 
existing settlement systems, it is standard pro -
cedure. Settlement with DLT and tokenised se -
curities could either be done in connection 
with existing payment systems (as described 
above) or would require tokenised money on the blockchain. This could include representa -
tions of commercial bank money. However, 
due to its systemic importance, it is much more 
common, and also required by international 
standards, to settle such transactions in central 
bank money, for example on the TARGET2-  
Securities platform operated by the Eurosys -
tem.
At present, a number of market infrastructure 
operators are looking into migrating some of 
their systems to DLT. For instance, the Austra -
lian stock exchange operator ASX is intending 
to replace its CHESS (Clearing House Electronic 
Subregister System) post- trade system, which 
has been in operation for more than 25 years, 
with a DLT- based solution.39 The new system is 
based on a closed- loop network (permissioned 
distributed ledger). This means, for example, 
that, unlike well- known public blockchain sys -
tems such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, this new 
blockchain has an administrator (the stock ex -
change) and that transactions can only be car -
ried out by participants approved by the ex -
change.
In future, it is conceivable that the entire value 
chain in the field of securities – from issuance 
through trade, clearing, and settlement to cus -
tody – could be processed using a single sys -
tem based on tokenised securities and DLT. 
Until this is actually possible, however, a variety 
of technical, organisational, legal and regula -
tory issues will have to be resolved. In terms of 
technical issues, it must be guaranteed above 
all that tokens can be transferred in a way that 
is resistant to counterfeiting. The organisational 
side is concerned with integrating all partici -
pants into an effective framework of govern -
ance that also sets out clearly defined responsi -
bilities and, if necessary, provides for intercon -
nectivity with other blockchains. At least in

BLOCKBASTER
In the BLOCKBASTER project (blockchain- 
based settlement technology research), 
Deutsche Börse and the Deutsche Bundes-
bank used a prototype to jointly research 
how the settlement of digitalised securities 
or digitalised units of value based on block-
chain could work. This included building a 
blockchain prototype based on the imple-
mentation of the Hyperledger Fabric frame-
work.1 At the same time, the company 
Digital Asset was commissioned to develop 
an identical prototype to gain experience 
based on different implementations of DLT. 
Performance and load tests were subse-
quently carried out and analysed for both 
prototypes. The results of the tests under-
taken in the spring of 2018 show that both 
prototypes are, in principle, suitable in 
terms of scalability for the live operation of 
fi  nancial market infrastructure and can 
serve as a basis for further developments.2 
At present, blockchain technology is still 
progressing rapidly, meaning that additional 
improvements with regard to productive 
use can be expected. With respect to the 
speed of the settlement of a single transac-
tion, blockchain proved somewhat slower 
and somewhat more expensive (more time 
required, more resources consumed) than 
conventional central architecture.
This made it clear that, in the case of simple 
settlement tasks without signifi  cant follow- 
up processes (i.e. in large segments of pay-
ments), conventional central architecture 
may remain superior. However, in the case 
of more complex settlement procedures, 
such as in trade fi  nance or securities, the 
advantages of using a common database 
could have a greater impact. The common 
database could allow follow- up processes, 
interim steps and reconciliation to be omit-
ted or accelerated. Overall, only a compre-hensive, more detailed cost- benefi  t analysis 
–  including a comparison with traditional 
technologies over the full life cycle of a 
secur ity – can provide a robust assessment 
of the advantages of the new technology. 
Furthermore, the research project made 
clear that the use of blockchain requires 
the close cooperation of all players in the 
settlements- as- a- network industry.

source framework for the development of blockchain 
applications. The BLOCKBASTER prototype is based on 
version 1.0.5.

treating digital tokens like securities, which fall 
under German property law. In particular, the 
legal nature of the tokens and the statutory re -
quirements in terms of custody (e.g. the role of 
the registrar) would need to be clarified.
For many of the use cases currently under in -
vestigation, there are prototypes that have not 
yet been deployed in regular operations. In 
some cases, DLT- based settlement has been ac -
companied by parallel conventional settlement 
for legal reasons so that, except for not having 
legal force, the prototypes’ full functionality 
can be demonstrated.40
Regulatory aspects
With the emergence of new technologies in 
the financial sector, the question arising time 
and again is whether they are adequately 
covered by the existing regulatory framework, 
or whether the framework needs to be 
adapted. In particular, the principle of “same 
business, same risks, same rules” should be 
taken into account. On the one hand, the pro -
tective function of the rules, e.g. regarding the 
stability of the financial system and consumer 
protection, as well as the general fulfilment of 
public sector mandates such as maintaining 
price stability or ensuring stable payment sys -
tems, must not be undermined. Yet on the 
other hand, regulation should be as technology- 
neutral as possible for the financial sector to 
make use of the benefits of innovation. The 
phenomenon of tokenisation and the establish -
ment of new transaction infrastructures have 
raised numerous regulatory issues which are 
currently the subject of intense debate by the 
competent authorities at the national and 
international level.
Current classification of crypto 
tokens
There are many different types of crypto token. 
The uses and risks vary greatly depending on their features, which is why the regulatory clas -
sification of crypto tokens ultimately needs to 
be determined on a case- by- case basis. For ex -
ample, the Federal Financial Supervisory Au -
thority (BaFin) is looking into whether individ -
ual crypto tokens fall within the scope of al -
ready existing financial market regulation (e.g. 
on securities, financial instruments or invest -
ment), bearing in mind the principle of techno -
logical neutrality. The regulatory classification 
can imply far-  reaching obligations for issuers, 
inter alia regarding due diligence with regard 
to anti- money laundering regulations and in -
vestor protection.
Over the past few years, crypto tokens have in -
creasingly been used as speculative financial 
assets. Given their high volatility, the European 
supervisory authorities, BaFin and the Bundes -
bank have in the past repeatedly warned in -
vestors of the associated risks. It would there -
fore be highly desirable to apply investor pro -
tection rules to securities-  like crypto tokens as 
these usually represent early- stage investments 
in start- ups which can involve a particularly 
high risk of loss. Added to this is the fact that 
crypto tokens are traded on unregulated sec -
ondary markets, which correspondingly har -
bours additional risk.
As a general rule, pure utility tokens –  even 
though they are occasionally used as a specula -
tive form of investment – are generally unlikely 
to be governed by existing financial regulation. 
Therefore, neither the investor protection rules 
under financial market legislation nor anti-  
money laundering provisions would apply. 
However, it should be borne in mind that 
crypto tokens are mostly also used to make 
payments.

Markets Authority (ESMA) from January 201941

Early integration of the fi  rst crypto tokens into the existing 
regulatory framework
As early as 2013, the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) stated publicly 
that –  in their assessment  – Bitcoins are 
units of account pursuant to section 1 (11) 
sentence  1 of the German Banking Act 
(Kredit wesengesetz) and are therefore fi  nan-
cial instruments within the meaning of the 
Banking Act. This supervisory classifi  cation 
meant that authorisation is not required for 
the mining and mere use of Bitcoins and 
other crypto tokens classifi  ed as units of ac-
count. By contrast, fi  nancial services includ-
ing the commercial purchase or sale of such 
crypto tokens – for example, by operating a 
crypto trading platform – require authorisa-
tion, and the operators of such fi  nancial 
services must comply with the requirements 
of the Money Laundering Act (Geldwäsche-
gesetz). This unambiguous approach by 
BaFin was an early response in Germany 
– unlike in many other countries – to poten-
tial risks posed by crypto tokens to the 
integ rity of the fi  nancial system. At the 
same time, it provided clarity with respect 
to the supervisory classifi  cation of the 
crypto tokens which were most relevant at 
that time.
However, BaFin’s administrative practice 
came in for criticism in a widely noted deci-
sion by the Berlin Court of Appeals (Kam-
mergericht Berlin) in September 2018. In 
particular, it was stressed that BaFin had 
gone too far in its classifi  cation of Bitcoin 
and other crypto tokens as units of account, 
since it is not within the remit of the execu-
tive to intervene in matters of law- making.
Even though the existing administrative 
practice of BaFin is not immediately af-
fected by this ruling in a criminal case and 
BaFin plans to adhere to its administrative 
practice, there have since been increasing calls for legislative initiatives to create legal 
certainty with regard to the supervisory 
treatment of crypto tokens1 and the tokeni-
sation of securities.
1 The draft law transposing the amending directive to 
the Fourth EU Anti- Money Laundering Directive (Ent-
wurf eines Gesetzes zur Umsetzung der Änderungs-
richtlinie zur Vierten EU- Geldwäscherichtlinie) defi  nes 
the term “crypto value” and classifi  es it as a fi  nancial 
instrument, which is likely to lead to services akin to 
banking and fi  nancial services (such as investment or 
contract broking) being offered. Furthermore, “crypto 
custody business” is being introduced as a fi  nan cial ser-

vis investors be put in place. The European 
Banking Authority (EBA) also published a report 
at the beginning of 201942 in which it reaches 
the conclusion that the divergent treatment of 
crypto tokens by national authorities could lead 
to risks for consumers and possibly allow regu -
latory arbitrage on account of the unlevel play -
ing field. Hence, the advice to the European 
Commission by ESMA and the EBA is to assess 
whether crypto tokens require additional regu -
lation.
Another question of particular interest is how 
payment tokens in the form of stablecoins are 
to be classified from a regulatory perspective, 
especially in the dominant variant of off-  chain 
backing with a currency. Depending on the 
coins’ form of issuance, use, remuneration and 
repayment claims, they could, for example, 
qualify as deposits, money market funds, in -
vestment funds or e- money. Given that individ -
ual stablecoins were potentially created to be 
used globally and that each jurisdiction has its 
own definition of what elements require regu -
lation, it might become necessary to jointly en -
hance the regulatory framework.
Oversight of settlement 
infrastructures 
Besides the legal status of tokens, the under -
lying transaction infrastructure also plays a role. 
Where financial market infrastructures are in -
volved, for instance, the bar has to be set high 
for those infrastructures which play an import -
ant role in the financial system, especially if 
they are systemically important. These require -
ments include risk provisioning in accordance 
with the Principles for Financial Market Infra -
structures (PFMI) established by the CPSS and 
IOSCO.43 Amongst other things, the principles 
stipulate that legal, liquidity and credit risk be 
mitigated. Operational risk – cyber risk in par -
ticular – should also be taken into account in 
the context of innovative technologies. In the 
event that DLT- based procedures become sys -
temically important, the PFMI as well as other relevant rules for financial market infrastruc -
tures might become applicable under certain 
conditions. One particular challenge here is 
that the PFMI address the system operator, 
whereas DLT- based infrastructures generally ex -
hibit highly decentralised elements.
Anti- money laundering and 
countering the financing of 
terrorism
If crypto tokens are used as a means of pay -
ment, they may also serve money laundering or 
terrorist financing purposes, especially where 
they allow anonymous or pseudonymous par -
ticipation. The decentralised issuance of crypto 
tokens – without any natural persons or legal 
entities as an issuer or intermediary – raises the 
issue of how to best subject them to anti-  
money laundering provisions. The intention is 
therefore that implementing the amendments 
to the Fourth EU Anti- Money Laundering Dir -
ective will bring crypto trading platforms and 
commercial wallet providers, i.e. the interface 
between crypto token ecosystems and the 
traditional financial system,44 into the general 
scope of anti- money laundering legislation. 
However, similar to cash transactions, purely 
decentralised transactions, which are carried 
out on a peer- to- peer basis, remain unaffected 
by this.
In view of the fact that crypto token networks 
often operate across borders, close international 
cooperation will be essential in order to pre -
vent crypto tokens from being used for criminal 
purposes. The relevant guidelines of the Finan -Can stablecoins

44 In order to facilitate the exchange between real cur -
rency and crypto tokens, crypto exchanges have no choice 
but to hold accounts in real currency. This is where anti-  
money laundering legislation comes into play because 
holding an account in the traditional financial system re -
quires clear identification of the account holder, be they a 
natural person or legal entity. Commercial crypto token 
wallet providers are likewise rooted in the traditional finan -
cial system and therefore likewise open the door to anti-  
money laundering rules.Deutsche Bundesbank

cial Action Task Force, as well as their rigorous 
international implementation and continued 
evolution, are thus particularly important.45
Efforts to modernise German 
law
In order to make use of the potential offered 
by new technologies, the coalition agreement 
by the parties that constitute the Federal Gov -
ernment sets out plans to develop a blockchain 
strategy and create an appropriate regulatory 
framework for trading with crypto tokens. 
Using tokens in a comprehensive manner 
– something that is technically possible – may 
also change the legal nature of individual finan -
cial instruments. Tokenisation would lead to a 
greater standardisation of financial instru -
ments, rendering them more easily transferable 
and fungible. Individual token- based invest -
ments may then assume securities- like proper -
ties within the meaning of the Securities Trad -
ing Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz) .46 Given 
that, in the case of some financial instruments, 
interest in customisation outweighs the desire 
for fungibility, there will also be limits to tokeni -
sation.47
In this context, the possibility of putting na -
tional transitional provisions into place for util -
ity tokens is currently being reviewed; this 
would ensure legal certainty and investor pro -
tection at the national level and could function 
as a bridging solution until a common Euro -
pean regulatory framework for utility tokens is 
established.
As a further element of the blockchain strategy, 
it is being discussed whether German law 
should be opened up to the issuance of elec -
tronic securities, making physical certification 
no longer obligatory.48 This should make it pos -
sible for securities49 to be issued in line with the 
Federal Government Debt Management Act 
(Bundesschuldenwesengesetz)  by entering 
them in a register. The register should be run 
by a government entity, or by a government-  supervised entity, so as to rule out the possibil -
ity of manipulation. An exception to this regis -
ter being managed or supervised by a govern -
ment entity should be possible if manipulation 
can be ruled out by using certain technolo -
gies.50 In such cases, it will be possible for is -
suers themselves or a designated third party to 
operate the register. Modernising German 
securities  legislation by opening it up to 
technology-  neutral electronic securities is 
something the Bundesbank would welcome, in 
principle.51 Moreover, it would be desirable for 
a single regulatory framework to be established 
at the European level. In this way, cross- border 
settlement could be made more efficient, espe -
cially with regard to the capital markets union.
Outlook and further areas 
of action
Irrespective of the volatile price spikes in pub -
licly accessible crypto tokens, the financial sec -
tor is increasingly focusing on the application- 
oriented use of DLT. In order to apply the digital 
transfer of values effectively, the financial sec -
tor is aiming for tokenisation to become em -
bedded in the regulatory framework.52
The various technical solutions for implement -
ing DLT are increasingly being tailored to the 
needs of the financial sector. The major initial 
problem of the blockchain procedure’s lack of 
scalability has been resolved in that it no longer 
appears to be a significant obstacle in closed-  
loop applications for financial market infra -
structures. In DLT prototypes pursued by finan -
cial service providers, the saved transaction his -Tokenisation

tory is no longer visible to all participants, ad -
dressing the legitimate need for confidentiality.
What is more, by displacing materially signifi -
cant information, the sector is preventing the 
unauthorised disclosure of information result -
ing from possible future decryption through 
improved computing by, say, quantum com -
puters. Financial service providers active in the 
field normally opt for a closed- loop, permis -
sioned blockchain, where all parties involved 
need to be approved by the operator. This 
allows for transparent governance, avoids any 
anonymous and thus potentially illegal transac -
tions and ensures that operators have a clear 
responsibility, including a competent contact 
person for issues regarding operational secur -
ity. Open blockchains do not appear to be a 
suitable option for either financial transactions 
or any form of confirming personal data.
The cooperation between various institutions 
has gradually produced functioning insular so -
lutions for DLT- based settlement of individual 
transactions involving these institutions. For 
reasons of operational efficiency and in order 
not to split liquidity across individual markets, 
the aim should be to make these insular solu -
tions used by individual consortia interoper -
able.
Against this backdrop, the efforts of the finan -
cial industry to create technically secure as well 
as formal and legally binding tokens represent 
the next logical step. Through the process of 
tokenisation, DLT can accelerate the digitalisa -
tion of payment and securities settlements. 
Traditional crypto tokens in open permission -
less networks are likely to play only a minor 
role. Stablecoins, ideally connected to stable 
currencies issued by central banks, or simply to 
commercial bank money, can help accelerate 
settlement and partially replace intermediaries. 
Digital central bank money, by contrast, is not 
required for this purpose.
A technically secure and efficient tokenisation 
of values is the prerequisite for a functioning decentralised settlement mechanism. In order 
for tokens to actually be used for financial 
transactions, as things now stand, the legal 
framework in Germany would need to be 
adapted to include a definition of the legal sta -
tus of tokens in general and of crypto tokens in 
particular; in addition, DLT- based solutions as 
transfer and issuance channels would need to 
be legally recognised.
Two recent developments may have a particu -
larly great impact on the role of central banks. 
First, the call for the authorisation of stable -
coins which are backed by central bank money, 
and, second, the creation of large consortia to 
develop stablecoins that can be used world -
wide, e.g. Libra. In the first case, although no 
digital central bank money would formally be 
generated, market participants might associate 
stablecoins backed with central bank money 
with a high level of security, helping them to 
widely penetrate the market. Compared with 
clearing in commercial bank money only, this 
could make settlements in the field of innovate 
financial market infrastructure more secure, 
even without digital central bank money. How -
ever, payments would then take place outside 
the real- time payment systems operated and 
monitored by central banks (e.g. TARGET2), 
with potential implications for the role played 
by central banks and for market participants’ 
liquidity management. Even more far- reaching 
implications would be conceivable in the latter 
case, where stablecoins are issued by inter -
national consortia. At present, important tech -
nical, organisational and regulatory questions 
concerning the approach of the Libra consor -
tium remain open. Considering potential ef -
fects is therefore still speculative. Nevertheless, 
it seems appropriate that supervisory author -
ities and central banks are already carefully 
monitoring and assessing these developments. 
Innovations which are able to increase welfare 
and lower transaction costs should be facili -
tated. However, key objectives such as price 
stability, financial stability and the security of 
payments must not be compromised. More -

this in mind, it would seem advisable for the 
European banking industry to press ahead more resolutely than in the past with its efforts 
to modernise the payments landscape and find 
European solutions.
