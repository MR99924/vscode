Underlying trends
The recovery of the German economy con-
tinued in the last quarter of 2010. In particu-
lar, industrial output grew strongly again. The
construction sector, like parts of the transport
sector, suffered from the heavy snowfalls in
December, but the influence on overall eco-
nomic output in the fourth quarter is likely to
have been of secondary importance. Private
consumption may have risen further. In any
case, private households registered a signifi-
cantly higher number of motor vehicles in
seasonally adjusted terms than in the previ-
ous quarter and the sentiment was very posi-
tive. Reliable data on retail sales are not yet
available.1The higher domestic sales of cap-
ital goods manufacturers point to a further
improvement in investment activity.
In view of the strong rise in orders received by
German industry in November, the outlook
for the first quarter of 2011 and beyond has
brightened considerably. Thus, the latest re-
sults of the monthly short-term business stat-
istics can be seen to converge with the senti-
ment indicators somewhat. Overall, however,
the short-term data currently available sug-
gest a slight slowdown in the macroeconomic
pace of recovery after the start of 2011.
According to the initial estimate of the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, overall output in Ger-
many in 2010 increased by 3.6% year-on-

6year (calendar-adjusted 3.5%), following a
decline of 4.7% in 2009. The upturn in the
economy was mainly driven by exports, but
spilled over fairly swiftly and clearly to private
investments and consumer spending. Work-
ing hours, which had served as a buffer dur-
ing the crisis, returned to normal and the
number of persons in work even rose slightly.
The total number of hours worked largely
counterbalanced the decline in the previous
year.
Industry
With a decline of 0.6% in November, indus-
trial output was not able to fully maintain the
October level in seasonally adjusted terms;
but on an average for October and Novem-
ber, output was up significantly by 23/4%
from the average in the third quarter, which
was revised upwards by 0.5%. The manufac-
ture of intermediate goods increased percep-
tibly (+11/2%) and the 5% growth in capital
goods was very substantial, mainly owing to
developments in the automotive industry
(+61/2%) and in mechanical engineering
(+53/4%). Consumer goods output remained
unchanged.
Demand for industrial goods increased
strongly by 5.2% in November compared
with the previous month. The two-month
average for October-November thus exceeded
the average of the previous quarter by a sub-
stantial 21/2%. In particular, the capital goods
sector showed a considerable rise. The mech-
anical engineering sector recorded an in-
crease in orders of 53/4%. Motor vehicle
manufacturers were up by 21/2%. ElectricalEconomic conditions in Germany*

7engineering likewise showed a very positive
development, although the result was influ-enced by one unusually large order by thisindustry’s standards. The consumer goodssector showed a slight increase. On thewhole, domestic demand proved to be al-most as dynamic as foreign orders in the two-month average under consideration. Ordersfrom non-euro-area countries moved upsharply, whilst those from the euro area fellfurther.
Domestic industrial sales increased signifi-
cantly in October and November by a season-ally adjusted 4% compared with the previousquarter. Capital goods were up by as muchas 7
3/4%. This may be closely connected with
the expiry at the end of 2010 of the tax in-centives for investments as part of the eco-nomic stimulus packages. Current informa-tion suggests that nominal exports of goodsincreased by only
3/4%, whilst industrial ex-
port sales rose by 43/4% in the same time
period. The value of imports rose by 11/2%;
higher energy prices are likely to have beenthe main reason for this.
ConstructionConstruction output declined by a seasonally
adjusted 1.1% in November compared withOctober. Building construction remained al-most unchanged, but the civil engineeringsector could not maintain the high perform-ance of the previous month. Both areasshowed a similar rise in a comparison of Oc-tober-November with the previous quarter’saverage. The previous year’s level was ex-ceeded in November by 7% in building con-struction and by 4
1/4% in civil engineering.
The upturn in orders received continued inprivate construction (the latest figures referto October) whilst there were no new im-pulses from the public sector in the last fewmonths.
Labour marketThe labour market situation showed a further
improvement. According to the provisionalfigures of the Federal Statistical Office, thenumber of persons in work in Germany wentup by a seasonally adjusted 28,000 in Novem-ber on the month. This represented a year-on-year increase of 1.1%. The pace of growthin employment subject to social security con-tributions weakened in October, however,and the scale of economically induced short-time work remained virtually unchanged onthe month. Enterprises’ willingness to recruitstaff remained high at the end of the year.This is evident in both the Ifo employmentbarometer and the Federal EmploymentAgency’s BA-X index for job vacancies.
The slight decline in unemployment did not
continue at the end of 2010. The number ofpersons registered as unemployed rose in De-cember by a seasonally adjusted 3,000. Theonset of the early and severe winter is likelyto have played a part here. The seasonally ad-justed unemployment rate was unchanged at7.5% in December and was therefore down0.6 percentage point on the year. 3.24 mil-lion people were registered as unemployedon an annual average in 2010, 179,000fewer than in 2009. The unemployment ratedeclined by 0.5 percentage point to 7.7%.

8Prices
On account of declining inventories owing to
the early and severe onset of winter in many
parts of the world, crude oil prices continued
their fairly steady rise, which had started in
the last third of November. On average in De-
cember, the spot price for Brent oil was, at
US$92 per barrel, almost 7% above the aver-
age of the previous month. Owing to the
further depreciation of the euro against the
US dollar, there was an increase of just over
10% in euro terms. As this report went to
press, the spot price remained at the elevated
level of US$973/4. The term structure stayed
very flat. There were even small haircuts for
six-month and 18-month deliveries.
Following a sideways movement in October,
import prices increased strongly by a season-
ally adjusted 1.8% in November compared
with the previous month, owing to higher
crude oil prices and the weaker euro. Import-
ers had to pay just over 51/2% more for en-
ergy products, and the prices of industrial
goods also rose by 1%. The year-on-year
figure increased to 10% overall. Prices in do-
mestic sales were up by a seasonally adjusted
0.5% compared with 0.3% the previous
month. Price increases in energy (+1.0%) and
industrial goods (+0.5%) were responsible
for this. The year-on-year figure remained
largely unchanged at around +4.4%.
Consumer prices showed a strong rise of
+0.5% in seasonally adjusted terms in De-
cember compared with November. Owing to
the heavy snowfalls, there was a pronounced
rise mainly in the prices of petrol and heatingoil, and the prices of seasonal food products
also increased appreciably. Price develop-
ments in the other components were more or
less subdued, however. According to the na-
tional Consumer Price Index (CPI), the annual
rate of consumer price increases in December
stood at 1.7% overall, compared with 1.5%
in November. The corresponding figure for
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
(HICP) was 1.9%, compared with 1.6% in
the previous month. On an annual average
for 2010, inflation increased by 1.1% (CPI) or
1.2% (HICP) compared with the previous
year (+0.4% and +0.2% respectively).
Public finances2
Debt
According to provisional figures, the debt
of central government, including its special
funds, rose by €42 billion to around €1.075
trillion in the 2010 calendar year;3in this con-
text, there was a shift to longer maturities.
The outstanding volume of Federal bonds
(Bunds) alone increased by €34 billion. Stocks

lion) and two-year Federal Treasury notes

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August
and November), by contrast, contain a detailed descrip-
tion of the development of public finances during the
preceding quarter. For detailed data on budgetary devel-
opments and public debt, see the statistical section of
this report.

special funds, namely the Financial Market Stabilisation
Fund (SoFFin) and the Investment and Repayment Fund.
The level of new debt recorded in the budget, which
came to €44 billion for the core budget alone, tends to
deviate from the figure recorded here, principally be-
cause of bookings being made on different dates.International

9(Schätze) (€13 billion) also grew. By contrast,
there was a decline of €18 billion in stocksof Federal Treasury discount paper (Bubills),which has maturities of between threemonths and one year and whose share oftotal debt had soared in the previous year.This fall was due, in particular, to the factthat issues of short-dated paper in the fourthquarter were €20 billion below the volumeoriginally planned. Of the other instruments,bank loans, above all, continued to decline(-€5 billion), which was in line with the trendseen in recent years. All in all, given thatbudgetary developments were more favour-able than expected, one-off issues were cutby €31 billion net compared with the forecastfor 2010 made in December 2009; in add-ition to minor adjustments in the third quar-ter, this mainly affected issuances in the finalquarter.
Overall, the share of Bunds in total debt
climbed by 1 percentage point to 58%, whilethe share of Bobls rose by just under 1
1/2per-
centage points to 18%. The outstanding vol-ume of inflation-indexed Bunds and Boblsgrew by 1 percentage point to just over 3%of total debt. The share of two-year Schätzewent up by just over
1/2percentage point to
12%, while that of Bubills saw a decline of2 percentage points to 8%. Nonetheless, theshare of Bubills was still clearly above the pre-2009 levels.
As in the preceding years, in 2010 central
government achieved substantial savingswith regard to the costs of refinancing matur-ing securities. While maturing Bunds had acoupon of 5.3% on average, the averageweighted yield on new issues of non-
inflation-indexed Bunds (including those witha 30-year maturity), reached a new low of2.8%. The interest rate on maturing Boblsstood at 2.9% on average, and was thus stillaround 100 basis points higher than the aver-age yield on new issues of Bobls. However,the largest savings were made in the refinan-cing costs for two-year Schätze. While anaverage interest rate of 3.5% was paid onmaturing two-year Schätze, the average yieldon new issues was a mere 0.8%. For Bubills,by contrast, there was barely any declinein yields on new issues compared with matur-ing paper. All in all, interest costs arelikely to have fallen by around €3 billion peryear as a result of the clear improvement inAverage rates of interest on maturing

rates remain unchanged, 2011 would see re-
financing savings, above all for maturing
Bunds, but also for Bobls.
Central government’s issuance plans for
2011 envisage gross capital market borrow-
ing in the form of one-off issues amounting
to €302 billion. However, redemptions total-
ling €271 billion are also planned. In addition,
the segment of inflation-indexed Federal
securities with issues of up to €12 billion is to
be expanded further. Furthermore, central
government has not ruled out the possibility
of issuing additional foreign currency bonds.
The figures for general government debt
(central, state and local government and the
social security funds) as defined in the Maas-
tricht Treaty are available for the period up to
the end of the third quarter of 2010. They
show that the level of debt rose by €86 billion
to €1.847 trillion in the first nine months of
last year owing, among other things, to the
inclusion of the debts of a bad bank that was
set up for a Landesbank. In relation to GDP in
the preceding four quarters, the debt ratio
stood at 74.7%, and was thus 1.3 percent-
age points higher than at the end of 2009.
Local government finances
According to the latest data from the Federal
Statistical Office, local government recorded
a deficit of €11/2billion in the third quarter of
2010, compared with €21/2billion a year earl-
ier.5This decline is due to the combination of
a rise of just over €1 billion in revenue and
largely unchanged expenditure. Revenue re-ceived a particular boost from tax receipts,
which were up by 101/2% (€11/2billion) on the
year. This rise was largely attributable to soar-
ing local business tax revenue, which grew by
30% after deduction of the shares accruing
to other government levels. In the capital
account, too, receipts increased by nearly €1
billion, not least owing to investment grants
as part of the second fiscal stimulus package
and to asset realisations. Even so, the absence
of the one-off dividend distribution of €1 bil-
lion by the Munich public utilities received in
2009 had an impact, and tax-revenue-linked
state government general grants saw a sig-
nificant decline (-€1/2billion). On the expend-
iture side, following strong growth in the pre-
ceding quarters, the third quarter saw more
moderate rises in other operating expenditure
and, above all, in spending on social benefits,
which was only1/2% higher, after increasing
by 8% in the first half of the year. While cur-
rent expenditure increased again overall, cap-
ital account payments fell significantly. The
rise of 61/2%( €1/2billion) in fixed asset forma-
tion was more than offset by the decline in
outlays resulting from the fact that the one-
off capital injection into the Munich public
utilities no longer had an impact.
At the end of the first three quarters of 2010,
the deficit for local government came to just
4As the interest payments for most new issues are not
due until subsequent years, the budgetary relief – after
adjustment for premiums and discounts – that this entails
will not start to take effect until 2011.
5Owing to data problems connected with the change-
over to commercial double-entry bookkeeping for local
government budgets, the Federal Statistical Office no
longer publishes figures for individual quarters. The quar-
terly figures cited in this article are calculated by deduct-
ing the most up-to-date figures for the first half of the
year from the cumulated results for the first three quar-
ters.Outlook for

11over €9 billion, compared with just over €61/2
billion a year earlier. Given the favourable
macroeconomic developments, local govern-ment tax revenue can be expected to con-tinue to rise overall in the final quarter of2010. The deficit for the year as a whole isthus likely, at least, to remain under thethreshold of €10 billion. However, a clear de-cline is not yet foreseeable for 2011.
Reducing the substantial budgetary imbal-
ances remains a matter of urgency. This isparticularly true of those municipalities whichhave accumulated a large volume of cash ad-vances. At the end of the third quarter, cashadvances across all municipalities in the non-city states had increased by €1 billion com-pared with the level at the end of June 2010,reaching €40
1/2billion. The share of these
loans – which are actually only permitted forthe purpose of bridging short-term liquidityshortages – in the total debt of the municipal-ities’ core budgets thus continued to grow,reaching as much as one-third. While the mu-nicipalities in Baden-Württemberg, Bavariaand Thuringia, which were under far below-average strain, were at least able to slightlyreduce their stocks of cash advances overall,the volume continued to rise in the munici-palities which already had very large stocks ofcash advances, above all in North Rhine-Westphalia, but also in Rhineland-Palatinateand Saarland. The foreseeable recurrence offunding deficits means that a reversal of thisworrying development, although necessary,appears unlikely.Public long-term care insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme
posted a marginal deficit in the third quarterof 2010, after recording a slight surplus ayear earlier. Revenue expanded by 2% over-all. In the favourable macroeconomic envir-onment, receipts from contributions grew byalmost 2
1/2%, with contributions for em-
ployed persons rising by just over 21/2%a n d
those for recipients of unemployment bene-fits falling by just over 6%. Pensioner contri-butions increased only slightly following thewaiver of the pension adjustment scheduledfor mid-2010. Growth in expenditure did de-celerate but, at 5%, remained significantlyabove the rise in revenue. The gradual deteri-oration in the scheme’s finances thereforecontinued.

12slightly to just under €5 billion at the end of
September, but were still clearly above the
statutory minimum of around €1 billion.6
For the first nine months of 2010, the public
long-term care insurance scheme posted a
virtually balanced budget. This constitutes a
year-on-year financial deterioration of €1/2bil-
lion, which is due, not least, to the second in-
crease in benefit rates, which entered into
force on 1 January 2010. A surplus is likely to
be recorded for 2010 as a whole owing to
the fact that contribution receipts are usually
higher in the final quarter, which will allow a
slight increase in the scheme’s reserves. Its
finances are likely to improve in 2011 if em-
ployment and wages continue their marked
rise. In addition, the benefit rates per long-
term care case will remain unchanged in2011.7Nonetheless, demographic change
alone means that expenditure will, in future,
probably continue to rise more rapidly than
income subject to compulsory insurance con-
tributions. It is therefore foreseeable that the
level of revenue that can be generated with
the current contribution rate will no longer
be sufficient to cover current expenditure.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2010, the issue volume in the
German bond market, at €196.4 billion
(gross), was significantly higher than in Octo-
ber (€123.8 billion). However, sales and pur-
chase figures in the German bond market in
November were once again influenced by the
transactions conducted by FMS Wertmanage-
ment (FMS-WM), which had taken on a credit
institution’s debt in October and which is
classified, for statistical purposes, as being in
the public sector. Taking the redemptions
and changes in issuer’s holdings of their own
bonds into account, in which the increase in
FMS-WM’s holdings of its own bonds played
a key role, the volume of domestic debt
securities on the market remained €37.7Finances of the public long-

The outstanding amount of foreign debtsecurities in the German market decreased by€5.9 billion.
In the month under review, most of the public
sector issues were attributable to the highlevel of borrowing by FMS-WM. However, aspublic sector issues were eclipsed by the in-crease in FMS-WM’s holdings of its own debtsecurities, the volume of public debt securitieson the market decreased by €40.6 billion.Events on the primary market were almostexclusively shaped by central government.Apart from FMS-WM transactions, it issuedmainly ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds; €6.5billion), two-year Federal Treasury notes(Schätze; €5.9 billion) and five-year Federalnotes (Bobls; €4.0 billion) as well as, to alesser extent, Federal treasury discount paper(Bubills; €0.9 billion). By contrast, centralgovernment redeemed 30-year Federal bondsworth €0.7 billion and Federal savings notesamounting to €0.1 billion. On balance, theGerman federal states only accessed thecapital market to a minimal extent.
In November, German credit institutions
slightly reduced their capital market debtand, in net terms, redeemed bonds totalling€0.6 billion. These consisted mainly of otherbank debt securities (€3.5 billion), whichallow flexible structuring, as well as publicPfandbriefe and mortgage Pfandbriefe (€2.3billion and €0.7 billion respectively). Mean-while, there were net issuances of debt secur-ities amounting to €5.9 billion by specialisedcredit institutions.In the reporting month, German enterprises
tapped the bond market for €3.6 billion, andthus on a smaller scale than in the previousmonth (€5.4 billion). In net terms, their issu-ances exclusively involved bonds with originalmaturities of more than one year.
Foreign investors were the main purchasers
of debt securities in the German bond marketin November. In total, they invested €29.5 bil-lion in domestic debt instruments, of whicharound half was invested in private and halfin public debt securities. In net terms, Ger-man non-banks slightly increased their hold-ings of debt securities (€1.1 billion). In thiscontext, sales of domestic paper were accom-panied by purchases of foreign paper. Bycontrast, German credit institutions sold debtsecurities amounting to €74.1 billion net;

Equity market
In November, new shares worth a total of
€0.3 billion were issued by domestic enter-
prises – the majority of which were listed
companies – in the German equity market.
The outstanding amount of foreign equities
in the German market increased by €7.6 bil-
lion. Shares were purchased by domestic
credit institutions as well as resident non-
banks, which added shares worth €5.0 billion
and €4.9 billion respectively to their port-
folios. Foreign investors, however, disposed
of German shares worth €2.0 billion.
Mutual fund shares
In the reporting month, domestic investment
funds recorded a net inflow of €8.3 billion,
compared with €7.4 billion in October. On
balance, the additional capital mainly bene-
fited specialised funds reserved for institu-
tional investors (€6.2 billion). Of the funds
open to the general public, it was primarily
the share-based funds and mixed securities-
based funds that sold new shares (€1.5 billion
and €0.7 billion respectively). In addition,
money market funds and mixed funds also
sold new shares, albeit to a lesser extent
(€0.3 billion and €0.2 billion respectively). By
contrast, open-end real estate funds and
bond-based funds recorded slight outflows
(-€0.7 billion and -€0.4 billion respectively).
Foreign funds traded in the German market
sold new shares totalling €4.7 billion inNovember. German non-banks were the prin-
cipal investors in mutual funds, buying shares
worth €8.2 billion. German credit institutions
and foreign investors purchased mutual fund
shares amounting to €4.3 billion and €0.5 bil-
lion respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €12.0 billion
in November 2010 and was thus similar in
size to the previous month’s figure (€12.1 bil-
lion). However, the result in question was
due to a narrower trade surplus which was
broadly offset by the shift in invisible current
transactions, comprising services, income and
current transfers, from deficit to surplus.
According to provisional figures from the
Federal Statistical Office, in November the
foreign trade surplus was down by €1.3 bil-
lion on the month to €12.9 billion. After ad-
justment for seasonal and calendar variations,
it decreased by €2.4 billion to €11.8 billion.
The value of exports rose slightly by 0.5%,
while the value of imports saw a marked in-
crease of 4.1%. Taken together, October and
November saw seasonally adjusted nominal
exports that were 0.8% above the third-
quarter average; around half of this growth
was price-related. Imports enjoyed an in-
crease of 1.4% which, however, was entirely
attributable to higher import prices.

15month earlier. The shift arose from an im-
proved situation in the services sub-account,which boasted a net surplus of €0.9 billionfollowing a deficit of €1.4 billion in October.This development was almost entirely theresult of reduced expenditure on travel. Thesurplus in cross-border income remained un-changed at €3.6 billion. The deficit in currenttransfers grew by €0.4 billion to €4.0 billion.
With respect to cross-border portfolio invest-
ment, there were net capital imports of€25.0 billion in November, compared withlarge capital exports of €128.4 billion in Octo-ber, the bulk of which resulted from the es-tablishment of a winding up agency for a do-mestic credit institution (bad bank) as an en-tity under public law. The capital inflowswere generated by the investment activity offoreign investors in Germany (€28.4 billion),whose primary focus was on German debtsecurities (€29.5 billion). They acquired bonds(€17.0 billion), in particular public-sectorpaper, as well as money market instruments(€12.4 billion). By contrast, they disposed of asmall quantity of German shares (€1.6 bil-lion). German investors likewise added for-eign paper (€3.3 billion) to their portfolios.While they purchased mutual fund shares(€4.7 billion) and shares (€4.5 billion), theysold money market paper (€4.1 billion) andbonds and notes (€1.8 billion).
Direct investment resulted in net capital out-
flows (€3.1 billion) during the reportingperiod. This was due largely to the fact thatGerman enterprises provided their foreignaffiliates with funding worth €6.9 billion viaadditional equity capital (€3.5 billion) andMajor items of the balance

17The banknote cycle and banknote recycling
in Germany
In its capacity as a central bank, the Bundesbank ensures a smooth supply of currency to the
economy, even in crisis situations, and safeguards the authenticity and high quality of the bank-
notes in circulation. In doing so, it fulfils its statutory mandate, which was confirmed in a judge-
ment by the Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in 2007. Through the issuance and destruction
of banknotes, the Bundesbank is the point at which the cash cycle starts and finishes. The volume
of German euro banknotes in circulation has been increasing steadily since the introduction of
the euro and had risen to €367 billion at the end of the period under review. Only 10% to 15%
of the issued banknotes are used in domestic payments, which circulate between the various
cash-handling parties. In 2009, the Bundesbank issued banknotes with a total value of €449 bil-
lion into the national cash cycle and received lodgements to the amount of €430 billion.
Until a few years ago, the majority of banknotes in circulation were processed and checked for
authenticity and fitness by the Bundesbank before being reintroduced into the cash cycle. In
2006, the Bundesbank decided, as part of its cash management strategy, to give the market
players the opportunity to take on a share of up to 50% of the total banknote recycling volume
in accordance with the European regulatory framework. A major prerequisite for this was that,
in the course of technological advances, cash processing systems be developed that would also
allow private cash handlers, such as credit institutions or cash-in-transit (CIT) companies, to carry
out automated checks on banknotes and reissue them. Widescale use was already being made
of this option in 2009, particularly by the banking industry. Private cash handlers processed and
reissued banknotes to the value of €240 billion, of which €45 billion was by machine and €195
billion manually at the bank counter. Relative to the total recycling volume of €670 billion, the
recycling rate for the banking industry was 36%, and 64% for the Bundesbank.
The return frequency is often cited as an alternative key indicator for measuring a central bank’s
involvement in the banknote cycle. It becomes apparent that – owing to conceptional weak-
nesses – this indicator does not provide a realistic picture of the situation. As an alternative, a
modified return frequency is presented here, which only takes account of those banknotes
which are actually in circulation (cash used for transaction purposes).
Private banknote recycling which has grown in significance, primarily as a result of the customer-
operated combined deposit and withdrawal systems (cash-recycling machines) in operation at
credit institutions, will result in a shortening of the cash processing chain. Nevertheless, the Bun-
desbank will continue to fulfil its statutory mandate for cash payments in the future, too, by tak-
ing an active role in banknote processing.

18The circulation of euro banknotes in Ger-
many
The volume of euro banknotes in circulation
in Germany, at around €367 billion at present
(see adjacent chart), is defined, in purely
mathematical terms, as the difference be-
tween the total amount of lodgements and
withdrawals at the Bundesbank since 2002
(cumulated net issuance).1The volume is
characterised by the fact that it has been in-
creasing steadily since the introduction of the
euro, albeit at decelerating annual growth
rates. The financial crisis at the end of 2008
led to significantly higher growth rates in the
short term, which then returned to normal
again during 2009. Bundesbank studies sug-
gest that the large volume of outpayments
made by the Bundesbank – owing, in particu-
lar, to foreign demand – led to a steady rise
in the volume of banknotes in circulation in
Germany.2
The composition of the volume of banknotes
in circulation is determined by both the
’transaction’ motive, which mainly plays a
role in withdrawals of smaller denominations
at cash dispensers, and the ’store of value’
motive, which is reflected in the demand for
larger denominations (see chart on page 19).
This is why small and medium-sized denomin-
ations, especially the €50 note (29%), play a
dominant role in terms of the total number of
banknotes in circulation. In terms of value,
however, €50 notes form a smaller part of
the total volume of banknotes in circulation
(30%) than €500 notes (35%).The volume of banknotes actually in circula-
tion in Germany differs considerably from the
cumulated net issuance. This is due, first, to
the demand for currency from countries out-
side the Eurosystem and, second, to the mi-
gration of banknotes between Eurosystem
member states, say, through cash transfers
by tourists and foreign workers. Yet, only a
small percentage of the banknotes in circula-
tion in Germany is actively used for payment
purposes, while a considerable percentage is
hoarded. It is estimated that only 10% to
15% of the total volume of German bank-
notes is actually used in the banknote cycle.3Euro banknotes in circulation

19The banknote cycle in Germany
The banknote cycle is the outcome of the
banknote flows between the Bundesbank,
credit institutions, consumers and retailers. In
simple terms, the central bank issues bank-
notes to the commercial banks, which, in
turn, provide the banknotes for withdrawals
by their customers. The banknotes are used
by consumers for their day-to-day purchases
and are then deposited at the central bank by
retailers, either directly or via the commercial
banks. The role of the CIT companies in this
cycle is essentially the transport and service
provider function between the central bank
and the commercial enterprises.
The value of the total amount of banknotes
issued by the Bundesbank in 2009 was
around €488 billion (see chart on page 20).
These banknotes were issued almost exclu-
sively to credit institutions (€476 billion). The
credit institutions used roughly €39 billion of
this amount to cover demand from countries
outside the Eurosystem. The residual amount
was purchased primarily by public authorities
(€11 billion). The Bundesbank therefore placed
a total of €449 billion into the national bank-
note cycle.
The banking industry, for its part, paid out
€319 billion via cash dispensers and €371 bil-
lion over the counter to its customers.4In
addition to the amounts paid out by the Bun-
desbank to retailers and other parties (public
authorities, in particular), around €702 billion
was made available to consumers through
the national banknote cycle.Consumers use the banknotes for consump-
tion, hoarding, transfer payments abroad or
for lodgements at credit institutions. For rea-
sons of simplicity, the migration of banknotes
between Germany and other countries, as well
as the hoarding of banknotes in Germany, are
left aside in the remainder of this analysis.5
According to a survey conducted in 2008,6
roughly €542 billion of consumer purchases
in 2009 was settled in cash.7Of this inflow ofBanknotes in circulation

was paid in at the Bundesbank directly, main-
ly by large retailers. By contrast, smaller retail-
ers, in particular, deposited banknotes of
around €387 billion at credit institutions. The
volume of banknotes kept by retailers for the
purposes of giving change is relatively small
and can therefore be disregarded in the an-

Credit institutions received lodgements of
banknotes from households and retailers to
the amount of €459 billion over the counter
and to the amount of €44 billion via ma-
chine.8By contrast, credit institutions paid in
just €263 billion of their customers’ banknote
lodgements at the Bundesbank. Almost the
same amount (€240 billion) was directly re-
issued by credit institutions to their custom-
ers. Furthermore, banknotes from abroad to
the value of €35 billion were paid in at the
Bundesbank via commercial banks and €12

quently, the total volume of banknotes paid

lion.
Banknote recycling

tion and the Gentlemen’s Agreement be-
tween the Bundesbank and the German
banking industry (for further details, see the
adjacent box), under which all banknotes paid
out via cash dispensers have to be checked byDevelopment of banknote recycling
Gentlemen’s agreement
In 1994, the Bundesbank and the German Central
Credit Committee ( Zentraler Kreditausschuss, ZKA)
made a gentlemen’s agreement, with the involve-
ment of the Federal Criminal Police Office ( Bundes-
kriminalamt, BKA), that only banknotes checked by
the Bundesbank would be allowed to be dispensed
from ATMs. The aim of this agreement was to ensure
that no counterfeit notes would be paid out from
cash machines. Bank cashier transactions over the
counter were not affected by this agreement.
ECB operational framework
In the light of the widely diverging or even non-exist-
ing regulations within the Eurosystem regarding the
filling of ATMs, the Governing Council of the European
Central Bank adopted the Framework for the detection
of counterfeits and fitness sorting of euro banknotes
by credit institutions and professional cash handlers
(framework) in December 2004. The objective of this
framework was
– to create a uniform minimum standard for auto-
mated banknote processing by professional cash
handlers (hereinafter ‘cash handlers’) within the
euro area, thereby creating legal certainty for all
parties concerned, and
– to contribute to the assurance of quality and
authenticity of banknotes in circulation
The framework was implemented in Germany in 2007
by means of contracts agreed between the Bundes-
bank and around 1,450 commercial banks (84% of
the relevant institutions).
EU regulation and ECB Decision
Up until December 2008, the Regulation ((EC) No
1338/2001) laying down measures necessary for the
protection of the euro against counterfeiting obliged
credit institutions and other professional cash hand-
lers to withdraw euro banknotes and coins from
circulation if there was a suspicion that they were
counterfeit. In December 2008, the scope of this regu-
lation was extended to include payment service
providers (eg cash-in-transit companies) and other
economic agents who operate ATMs as an additional
activity (eg casinos and retailers). The legal obligation
to retain counterfeit money was supplemented by an
obligation to check the authenticity of the bank-
notes.
With regard to banknote checking, the Regulation
refers to the ECB framework. On this basis, the ECB
adopted a decision (decision with no addressees) on
16 September 2010 which placed the framework on a
legally binding basis throughout the Eurosystem. The
Decision entered into force on 1 January 2011. All
member states are obliged to impose sanctions for
infringements of Regulation (EC) No 44/2009 amend-
ing (EC) No 1338/2001 and to introduce the necessary
regulations into national law by the end of 2011.

22the central bank in advance for authenticity
and fitness, led, in the past, to a sharp in-
crease in the volume of banknotes to be pro-
cessed by the Bundesbank. The parallel tech-
nical advances in banknote processing had
two effects. First, banknote processing ma-
chines with a high throughput rate were de-
veloped, which led to processing being con-
centrated at a small number of Bundesbank
locations. Second, cash-recycling machines
and smaller banknote processing machines
are now available which allow decentralised
processing. The independent processing of
banknotes without the involvement of the
Bundesbank can generate macroeconomic
efficiency gains by shortening the processing
chain. To achieve this, the Bundesbank de-
cided that it needs to process only 50% of
the total banknote volume itself in order tofulfil its statutory mandate – counterfeit pre-
vention, ensuring the high quality of the
banknotes in circulation, and crisis preven-
tion. The remaining 50% can be processed
and recycled without the involvement of the
Bundesbank.
Banknote recycling consists in receiving, pro-
cessing and reissuing banknotes to house-
holds and enterprises. Private cash handlers
wishing to offer cash recycling services have
to adhere to the provisions stipulated in the
European regulatory framework for the inde-
pendent processing and reissuing of bank-
notes in Germany, which has been in place
since 2006. There is still the alternative possi-
bility of paying in banknotes at the Bundes-
bank directly. In order to boost overall effi-
ciency, the Bundesbank supports private
banknote recycling.
The model shown in the adjacent chart
shows an example of how private banknote
recycling works. In this case, the recycling
company offsets the banknote supply and de-
mand of two cash handlers. Typically, bank-
notes originating from retail transactions set-
tled in cash are accepted and processed in ac-
cordance with Eurosystem requirements.
These banknotes are then used to refill the

23In 2009, banknotes to the amount of €430
billion were paid in and processed at the Bun-desbank, not including the inflows of bank-notes from abroad. Banknotes to the value ofaround €240 billion were paid out by thebanking industry to its customers in the formof withdrawals, rather than paying them in atthe central bank. Relative to the overall recyc-ling volume, the Bundesbank and the bank-ing industry have recycling rates of 64% and36% respectively.

At present, private banknote recycling is car-ried out, first and foremost, by credit institu-tions.
10There are two main reasons: first, on
cost grounds, credit institutions are replacingmanual cash processing at the bank counter,which currently accounts for the bulk of allprocessing operations, with automated pro-cessing. Second, external CIT companies havenot yet offered any alternatives. Pursuant tothe Payment Services Oversight Act ( Zah-
lungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz ), CIT companies
undertaking activities that go beyond thepure commercial transportation of banknotesand coins, including acceptance, processingand handover, require authorisation from therelevant supervisory authority (for furtherdetails, see the adjacent box). In specificcases, the provision of payment services re-quiring authorisation may relate to the settle-ment of transactions arising from the supplyPayment Services Oversight Act
The prudential provisions set out in the EU
Payment Services Directive have been trans-posed into German law by means of the Pay-ment Services Oversight Act ( Zahlungsdienste-
aufsichtsgesetz ). Credit institutions and finan-
cial services institutions have, thus, beenjoined by a third category of institution,namely payment institutions. An enterprisewhich provides payment services generally re-quires authorisation pursuant to the PaymentServices Oversight Act. Under the PaymentServices Oversight Act, payment institutionsmust, for example, hold own funds, meet thesafeguarding requirements regarding custom-er funds laid down by law, have a proper busi-ness organisation and fulfil numerous notifi-cation requirements.
The Payment Services Oversight Act provides
for exceptions to the authorisation require-ment in various cases. For instance, the profes-sional transportation of banknotes and coins,including their collection, handling and deliv-ery, does not constitute a payment service.The activities undertaken by cash-in-transitcompanies as part of their cash supply andcollection operations may be deemed to be apayment service depending on their specificfeatures. In particular, according to the ex-planatory memorandum to the Payment Ser-vices Oversight Act, clearing via the cash-in-transit companies’ own accounts usually doesnot fall under the abovementioned exceptionfor the transportation of banknotes andcoins, which means that cash-in-transit com-panies – depending on their business model –may possibly require authorisation once thetransitional arrangement provided for in thePayment Services Oversight Act ends.
The Deutsche Bundesbank has decided that it
will, upon request, set up accounts for cash-in-transit companies that have been grantedauthorisation pursuant to the Payment Ser-vices Oversight Act. The aim is to facilitatecash recycling outside the Bundesbank.
Deutsche Bundesbank9It is not possible to calculate a recycling rate for the re-
tail sector at present as this sector was not subject to re-
porting requirements under the regulatory framework.
So far, credit institutions have reported only on a pilot
scheme with one CIT company, which recycles banknotes
for the credit institution.

via CIT company accounts.
Banknote recycling using machines operated
either by banks’ customers or staff showed a
marked year-on-year increase in 2009
(+44%), even though it was still at a low level.
In 2009, banknotes with a total value of
around €45 billion were machine-processed
by the credit institutions and paid out again to
customers. For the qualified banknote process-
ing and recycling activities carried out by the
commercial banks, some 5,40511customer-
operated cash-recycling machines and 785
staff-operated back-office machines12were in
use at the end of 2009. As shown in the chart
above, the number of banknote processing
systems in use in Germany has increased sig-
nificantly since the beginning of 2008.The widely varying degree of automation in
lodgements and withdrawals at credit institu-
tions is striking. While almost 50% of with-
drawals from German banks were made
using around 58,400 systems, only about
6,200 paying-in systems were available in
2009.13The increasing use of customer-
operated cash-recycling machines will lead to
an improvement, albeit limited, in the degree
of automation of lodgements. This is be-
cause, as a rule, such systems are deployed or
replace standard cash dispensers only if
lodgements and withdrawals very largely off-
set each other.
Retailers are likewise contributing towards an
increase in the banknote recycling rate out-
side the Bundesbank. Using the ’cash back’
procedure, customers can additionally make
a withdrawal of up to €200 in cash when
paying for their goods electronically at the
checkout. In Germany, the ’cash back’ pro-
cedure plays only a minor role. However, the
situation is different in other countries, such
as Norway, where widescale use is made of
the option of withdrawing cash when paying
for retail purchases.
The growing importance of private cash
handlers in banknote recycling has already
had an impact on the volume of lodgements
received by the Bundesbank. The period sinceNumberUse of banknote processing

252009 is the first time that there have been
two consecutive years with no year-on-year
increase in the volume of banknotes paid in
at the Bundesbank (see chart on page 26).
The return frequency
The return frequency is an easy-to-calculate
indicator which is used by many central banks
to measure their level of involvement in the
banknote cycle.14The indicator is used to cal-
culate how often the average volume of
banknotes in circulation flows back to the
central bank within a given 12-month period.
A falling return frequency indicates that the
central bank’s involvement is declining and
that private cash handlers are taking over
these tasks. It is therefore sometimes regard-
ed as an alternative to the recycling rate as a
measure of the central bank’s involvement in
the banknote cycle.
Between 2003 and 2010, the return fre-
quency in Germany fell from 5.4 to 2.0
owing to the increasing volume of banknotes
in circulation. This means that in 2003, each
banknote in circulation was returned to the
central bank and processed 5.4 times on
average, whereas the figure was just 2.0 in
2010.15The return frequency therefore
shows that the Bundesbank’s involvement in
cash processing has been declining since the
introduction of the euro. With regard to the
actual volume paid in, however, it would be
wrong to conclude from the return frequency
that there has been a dramatic decline in the
Bundesbank’s involvement. This is because
the volume of banknotes processed by theBundesbank has, with a few exceptions, in-
creased during the same period. The decline
in the return frequency cannot therefore be
explained by an increase in banknote recyc-
ling outside the Bundesbank.
The reason lies in the conceptual weaknesses
of the return frequency. Hoarded banknotes,
just like banknotes located abroad, hardly cir-
culate or do not circulate at all in the national
banknote cycle and only rarely flow back to
the central bank. Furthermore, banknote mi-
gration between euro-area member states af-
fects the return frequency. If, for example,
one central bank issues banknotes which are
then paid in at another Eurosystem central
bank, the volume of banknotes in circulation
increases in the first country, while it declines
in the second country. The actual volumes of
banknotes in circulation nationally therefore
do not correspond to the nominal volumes
that are recorded. If these aspects are not
taken into account, the return frequency
gives a distorted picture of a central bank’s
involvement in the banknote cycle.
Calculating the return frequency on the basis
of the banknotes actually used for transaction
purposes therefore gives a more realistic pic-
ture of the Bundesbank’s involvement in the
banknote cycle. As banknotes used for trans-
action purposes account for only a small per-
centage of between 10% and 15% of the
total volume of banknotes in circulation, it
14The return frequency in any given year is equal to the
sum of banknotes paid in at a central bank during that
year, divided by the average volume of banknotes in cir-
culation in that year.

share weightings fell from 5.8 at the beginning of 2003

26makes sense to restrict the return frequency
to these banknotes.16The estimated volume
of banknotes used for transaction purposes
was between €40 and €60 billion at the end
of 2009, which is equivalent to around 1.3 to
1.9 billion banknotes. This gives a return fre-
quency of the banknotes in a range of be-
tween eight and 11 times per year. Although
this range is relatively broad, it is evident that
calculating the return frequency on the basis
of banknotes used for transaction purposes
clearly reveals a greater involvement of the
Bundesbank in the banknote cycle. The re-
turn frequency is not a suitable indicator for
describing the role of private cash handlers
and the central bank in banknote recycling. It
makes more sense to calculate the import-
ance of the various cash handlers in banknoterecycling by the banknotes which they pro-
cess and then reissue.
Outlook
The German banknote cycle is characterised
by a large recycling volume at the Bundes-
bank and a growing volume at credit institu-
tions. Recycling at credit institutions is often
performed by means of manual transactions
at the counter. The degree of automation is
still very low, especially on the lodgement
side. The trend towards a greater use of cash-
recycling machines, which is already apparent
in the banking industry, is likely to continue in
future.
Banknote recycling has already undergone
rapid growth over the past two years, espe-
cially as a result of customer-operated cash-
recycling machines which are being used by
credit institutions. This is bringing about a
change in the role played by the Bundesbank
in the banknote cycle. Besides the continuing
impact due to the direct processing of bank-
notes, new tasks are also arising owing to the
need to control and monitor the activities of
external market participants. Where it makes
economic sense, these external participants
can also take on tasks in the banknote cycle.
However, as was confirmed in the ruling by

2007,17this does not imply that the Bundes-

27authenticity and fitness will become a
private-sector activity. The Bundesbank doesnot intend to withdraw completely frombanknote processing as it still has an obliga-tion to fulfil its statutory mandate, especiallyin crisis situations, like during the financial cri-sis or in the event that market participantsbecome insolvent. This includes safeguardingan efficient cash infrastructure, without itselfhaving to supply cash to each individualmember of the general public or each individ-ual retailer. Furthermore, the Bundesbank, asthe issuer of banknotes, must be in a position– even in the case of a withdrawal from themarket by private cash handlers – to processthe returning banknotes and reissue them.The question of whether yet other profes-
sional cash handlers, besides credit institu-tions, will take on a greater role in banknoterecycling is still to be answered. The fact thatthe banking industry’s and retailers’ confi-dence in the CIT sector has still not been fullyrestored is hindering banknote recycling bythe CIT companies, despite the regulatoryprovisions that are now in place under thePayment Services Oversight Act. It thereforeremains to be seen whether CIT companieswill make a significant contribution of theirown to banknote recycling in the short term.Nevertheless, cooperation models with creditinstitutions could serve as a basis for a largerrole for private banknote recycling.

29Foreign demand for euro banknotes issued
in Germany
Since the introduction of euro cash, the outstanding volume of euro banknotes issued by the
Deutsche Bundesbank has increased sharply. Cash held for domestic transactions by no means
accounts for this development, however. It is more likely to be due to domestic hoarding and, in
particular, foreign demand for euro banknotes. In addition to helping to explain the increase in
circulation, determining the volume of German euro banknotes in circulation outside Germany is
important for a number of other reasons. Firstly, banknotes in circulation outside Germany have
no impact on domestic demand, or at least a much smaller impact than those circulating in Ger-
many. This is a fundamental point to bear in mind when analysing the development of monetary
aggregates. Secondly, foreign demand for banknotes influences the way in which central banks
manage the money market. Thirdly, banknotes in circulation outside Germany are not returned
to the Bundesbank for processing as quickly as those paid in from domestic cash transactions.
This is relevant for measuring the Bundesbank’s participation in cash processing.
This article is the first detailed analysis and calculation of the foreign demand for euro banknotes
issued in Germany. However, one fundamental problem must be addressed, namely the impossi-
bility of precisely measuring the amount of cash in circulation outside Germany. It is thus appro-
priate to adopt an approach comprising a range of different, independent methods. This article
considers both direct approaches, based on existing surveys and statistics, as well as indirect ap-
proaches. The latter exploit the different properties of domestic and foreign demand. It transpires
that the percentage of the Bundesbank’s cumulated net issuance of euro banknotes in circula-
tion outside Germany has been increasing steadily and noticeably since 2002 when it amounted
to a mere 20%. At the end of 2009, an estimated 65% to 70% of Germany’s cumulated net
issuance of euro banknotes was in circulation outside Germany, mostly in non-euro-area coun-
tries. Between 15% and 25% of Bundesbank-issued euro banknotes were outstanding in other
euro-area countries, however. In addition to the banknotes in circulation outside Germany, the
stocks of German euro banknotes accounted for by domestic hoarding and transaction balances
were also estimated. These estimates put the percentage of the total volume of German euro
banknotes outstanding that was being hoarded in Germany at the end of 2009 at between 10%
and 30%. At 10% to 15%, the share of Bundesbank-issued banknotes estimated as being held
for domestic transaction purposes is relatively small. Hence it is important that measures of the
central bank’s degree of participation in the national cash processing cycle are not based on the
total outstanding stock of banknotes but are restricted to that portion held for domestic cash
transactions, that is the banknotes that actually circulate in the national cash cycle and return
relatively quickly to the central bank for processing.

30Background
Following the introduction of euro cash at
the start of 2002, the volume of German
euro banknotes outstanding1increased from
an initial €73 billion to €367 billion at last re-
port. The chart opposite shows that the vol-
ume of German euro banknotes outstanding
has grown very much faster than could have
been expected on the basis of earlier growth
rates for D-Mark currency. This growth can-
not be explained alone by an increased hold-
ing of transaction balances – that is cash held
for buying goods and services – as domestic
private consumption in the period under con-
sideration was weak and there was a steady
decline in the percentage of cash payments in
German retail sales.2This huge surge is there-
fore likely to be due to domestic hoarding
and foreign demand for euro banknotes is-
sued by the Bundesbank. For the first two
years after the launch of euro cash, this hy-
pothesis is substantiated by the need to re-
plenish stocks of banknotes both inside and
outside the euro area after the currency
changeover.
However, this should have ceased to have an
effect at the end of 2003 when the volume
of German banknotes outstanding was back
up to the hypothetical level where it would
have been had euro cash not been intro-
duced. But the pace of growth in the volume
of banknotes outstanding continued there-
after to be much more dynamic than in the
D-Mark era in the 1990s.
In addition to helping to explain the increase
in circulation, determining the volume of Ger-man euro banknotes in circulation outside
Germany is important for a number of other
reasons. Firstly, banknotes in circulation out-
side Germany have no impact on domestic
demand, or at least a much smaller impact
than those in circulation in Germany. This is a
fundamental point to bear in mind when ana-
lysing the development of monetary aggre-Circulation of German

1The outstanding volume of euro banknotes issued by
the Deutsche Bundesbank is the volume resulting from
the cumulated difference between monthly lodgements
and withdrawals at the Deutsche Bundesbank (cumu-
lated net issuance). In this text, this volume is also abbre-
viated to the “volume of German euro banknotes out-
standing”. In the statistical section of the Deutsche
Bundesbank’s Monthly Report, the volume of German
euro banknotes in circulation is calculated in a different
way because the banknotes in circulation are shown in
accordance with the accounting rules of the Eurosystem.

31gates.3Secondly, foreign demand for bank-
notes influences the way in which central
banks manage the money market. In terms of
value, the volume of banknotes outstanding
is the largest autonomous factor determining
liquidity and is also relatively difficult to fore-
cast. Thirdly, banknotes in circulation outside
Germany are not returned to the Bundesbank
for processing as quickly as those paid in
from domestic transaction balances. This is
relevant for measuring the Bundesbank’s
participation in cash processing.4
This article takes a closer look at the role that
foreign demand played in the rise in circu-
lation. In addition to calculating the global
volume of German euro banknotes in circula-
tion outside Germany, it includes a regional
breakdown into other euro-area countries
(cumulated domestic migration) and non-
euro-area countries. These analyses also en-
able us to approximately gauge the relative
shares of domestic and foreign circulation of
German euro banknotes being used in trans-
action balances and being hoarded.5
Approaches to measuring banknotes
in circulation outside Germany
The fundamental problem of calculating the
exact volume of German euro banknotes out-
standing is that this figure cannot be record-
ed statistically, or at least not to a reliable
enough degree, and must therefore be esti-
mated. As a result, the figures calculated in
this way are always subject to uncertainty. To
reduce this uncertainty and maximise the
results’ robustness, it is advisable to use avariety of empirical instruments and methods.
The methods used can be divided into direct
and indirect approaches. The aim of the for-
mer is to use those statistics and surveys that
are already available to arrive at approximate
figures for banknotes in circulation outside
Germany. The latter exploit either the differ-
ent properties of domestic and foreign de-
mand or make use of particular events, such
as the introduction of euro cash. This article
presents the results of selected direct and in-
direct approaches.
Direct approach 1: net shipments of euro
banknotes from Germany to non-euro-
area countries and foreign travel
One possible way of gaining information
about the volume of German euro banknotes
in circulation outside Germany is to use data
and surveys that enable conclusions to be
drawn about the unobservable volume of
cash in circulation outside Germany. For in-
3This is naturally complicated by the fact that Germany’s
contributions to Eurosystem monetary aggregates do not
contain currency in circulation and can certainly not be
interpreted as its own national monetary aggregates.
Neither are they comparable with the earlier German
monetary aggregates M1, M2 and M3.

banknote recycling in Germany, Monthly Report, January

euro banknotes outstanding are already available. See

32stance, certain information can be obtained
from a household survey on foreign travel
conducted by the Bundesbank and from
existing data on banks’ net shipments of euro
banknotes from Germany to non-euro-area
countries.6
On the basis of information from this survey
and an additional estimate of banknotes
being brought to Germany by travellers, the
cumulated volume of travel-related German
net exports of euro banknotes is estimated to
have amounted to €122 billion at the end of
2009. Roughly half of this is attributable to
other euro-area countries and the other half
to non-euro-area countries. For more infor-
mation, see the box on page 33.The official net shipments of euro banknotes
from Germany to non-euro-area countries
comprise withdrawals and lodgements of
euro banknotes at the Bundesbank by big
banks active in the global market for currency
dealing. The cumulated value of these Ger-
man net shipments to non-euro-area coun-
tries has been rising steadily since the intro-
duction of euro cash in 2002 and amounted
to €99 billion at the end of 2009. This means
that approximately 95% of the total net ship-
ments of the euro area comes from Ger-
many.
Taken together, the estimated travel-related
outflows of banknotes and the official net
shipment figures made up a foreign share of
around 65% of the total volume of German
euro banknotes outstanding at the end of
2009. The bulk (roughly €220 billion) of the
total volume of banknotes outstanding (just
short of €350 billion) was thus circulating
outside Germany’s borders. Non-euro-area
countries accounted for the largest share
(approximately €160 billion) of foreign bank-
note demand, while the cumulated net
exports of euro banknotes from Germany to
other euro-area countries amounted to €60
billion. The residual amount of almost €130
billion can thus be attributed to banknotes in
circulation in Germany (see the chart above).

34of German euro banknotes in circulation out-
side Germany are only estimates. An alterna-
tive method of determining foreign demand
is to subtract the sum of German euro bank-
notes circulating in Germany from the Bun-
desbank’s cumulated net issuance. Although
the former is likewise an unknown value, it
can be approximated by estimating the total
volume of euro banknotes in circulation in
Germany.7This, in turn, comprises domestic
transaction balances and the stocks of bank-
notes being hoarded. Domestic transaction
balances are made up of cash balances held
by banks, the general public, retailers and
service providers. On an annual average for
2008, an estimated €30 billion circulated in
Germany for transaction purposes.8
There are similarly no official statistics or sur-
veys concerning the stocks of euro banknotes
being hoarded in Germany; however, there is
a household survey from 2008 that was con-
ducted by TNS opinion on behalf of the Euro-
pean Central Bank but never published. This
survey is representative of German nationals
older than 14 years of age. In this survey,
1,042 people were asked how much cash
they keep as a store of value. From their
responses one can estimate that the total
amount of cash being hoarded by all (adult)
persons in Germany in 2008 was just under
€20 billion. This corresponds to a mere 5% of
the Bundesbank’s cumulated net issuance of
euro banknotes at the end of 2008. However,
the figures derived from the household sur-
vey are likely to significantly understate the
levels of cash actually hoarded in Germany
and are thus taken as only the lower bound.
It is likely, for instance, that some respond-ents were reluctant to disclose the full
amount of their cash hoardings.
The estimates of domestic transaction bal-
ances (approximately €30 billion) and euro
banknotes hoarded in Germany (just under
€20 billion) add up to a lower bound of just
under €50 billion for the volume of bank-
notes in circulation in Germany at the end of
2008. This corresponds to an upper bound
for the total volume of German euro bank-
notes in circulation outside Germany of an es-
timated €280 billion, which equates to 85%
of cumulated net issuance at the end of
2008.
As with the first direct approach, this ap-
proach also proves incapable of obtaining a
more accurate estimate of the volume of
German euro banknotes in circulation outside
Germany using the statistics and surveys
available. More precise estimates can be
yielded only if additional assumptions are
made, as in the first direct approach, or indir-
ect approaches are applied, as in the follow-
ing methods.
7Owing to domestic migration among euro-area coun-
tries, the volume of German euro banknotes in circula-
tion in Germany does not necessarily correspond to the
volume of all euro banknotes in circulation in Germany,
ie the (actual) domestic circulation of banknotes. As dem-
onstrated in the first direct approach, however, one can
assume that Germany is a net exporter of euro banknotes
to other euro-area countries. In other words, there are
more German euro banknotes circulating in other euro-
area countries than euro-area euro banknotes in Ger-
many. In net terms, the outstanding volume of German
euro banknotes in Germany thus equates to the domestic
circulation of banknotes.

35Indirect approach 1: seasonal method
The aim of the seasonal method is to filter
out information about banknotes in circula-tion outside Germany from the seasonalstructure of banknotes outstanding. For thispurpose, it is assumed that foreign demandfor German euro banknotes has little or noseasonality.
9Hence, foreign and domestic de-
mand exhibit different seasonal patterns, andthe seasonal component of the total volumeoutstanding is dampened by the foreignshare. The volume of German euro bank-notes in circulation outside Germany canthen be derived by estimating the unknownseasonal component of domestic circulation.For a more detailed description of the season-al method, see the box on page 36. This sec-tion presents three methods which can beused to gauge as reliable a picture as possibleof the seasonal component of the euro bank-notes held in Germany. The first methodcomprises selecting a reference country, thesecond uses a transaction variable and thethird analyses banks’ cash balances. As thesemethods are based on different assumptionsconcerning what share of foreign and domes-tic demand is recorded, the foreign share cal-culated also differs depending on the methodused.
An ideal reference country mirrors Germany’s
use of banknotes with the exception of for-eign demand. This is likely to be true ofFrance which, for instance, has a similarstandard of living to Germany and, as afellow euro-area country, the same banknotedenominations. Furthermore, given the factthat official net shipments of euro banknotesto non-euro-area countries consist almost ex-
clusively of German issues, it may be assumedthat, on balance, only very few euro bank-notes issued by France find their way to non-euro-area countries. With the exception ofdemand for euro banknotes from non-euro-area countries, France’s use of banknotes islikely to be very similar to that in Germany.As a result, the seasonal method using Franceas a reference country can give a good ideaof the volume of Bundesbank-issued eurobanknotes that are in circulation outside theeuro area.
Using this method, it is estimated that Ger-
man euro banknotes to a value of around€160 billion were circulating in non-euro-area countries at the end of 2009. These esti-mates are not implausible insofar as through-out the reporting period they are higher thanthe official cumulated German net shipmentsto non-euro-area countries, which representa lower bound of circulation outside Ger-many in this region chiefly due to the factthat they do not include foreign travel. Formore information, see the chart on page 37.
Another possible approach is to approximate
the domestic seasonal component of theeuro banknotes held in Germany using theseasonal variation of a transaction variable.This approach is based on private consump-tion expenditure in Germany. The domestichoarding of cash is captured by estimatingthe domestic income elasticity of demand
9However, small denominations used in foreign travel
are likely to be subject to seasonal influences, especially
within the euro area. Yet this is likely to be fairly insignifi-
cant in relation to the total volume of banknotes circulat-
ing outside Germany.Domestic and

36Seasonal method
The underlying seasonal model assumes that the
time series of German banknote issuance con-
sists of three terms: a trend component Tt,a
seasonal term Stand an irregular or noise com-
ponent. These are multiplicatively interlinked
(multiplicative seasonal model). Attributing the
noise term to the trend term for simplicity and
including a term for the share of outstanding
banknotes held abroad gives the following
equation,
(1) TtSt¼Td
tSd
tþTa
tSa
t,
where trepresents the time index, and dand a
stand for domestic and foreign variables, re-
spectively. Let /C12tdenote the fraction of the over-
all trend held domestically and, consequently,
(1/C0/C12t) the share held abroad:
(2) St¼/C12tSd
tþð1/C0/C12tÞSa
t.
Assuming that the foreign share does not vary
seasonally, ie Sa¼1for all t, equation (2) can be
further simplified to
(3) St¼/C12tSd
tþð1/C0/C12tÞ.
With given values for the seasonal terms Sand
Sd, an equation is produced containing an un-
known value, /C12t, which denotes the share of
banknotes held domestically:
(4) . /C12t¼St/C01
Sd
t/C01
Stis the seasonal component of total German
cumulated net banknote issuance and can be
calculated using the customary seasonal adjust-
ment methods (eg X12-ARIMA, Tramo/Seats). By
contrast, Sd, the seasonal term for the share of
banknotes circulating in Germany, is unknown
and must be estimated. However, equation (4)
does not always produce meaningful results. If,
for example, in any given period there is no sea-
sonal influence, ie St¼Sd
t¼1, any value of /C12tis
consistent with equation (4). It is thus impossibleto uniquely identify /C12t. Even if the seasonality of
all outstanding banknotes is not lower than that
of the banknotes held domestically in all
periods, problems can still occur. This method
thus produces plausible results for some but not
all periods.
Therefore, further adjustments have to be made
to allow for these factors and enable this
method to be applied. Meaningful estimatation
results can often only be generated for certain
frequencies of a year.1For example, in the case
of German banknote issues, the seasonal high is
in December, while the seasonal low is in Febru-
ary. This means there is a two-month frequency.
In order to factor this into equation (4), the time
index tin equation (3) is replaced by m; j, where
mrepresents the mthmonth and jstands for the
jthyear. If equation (3) for February is subtracted
from the corresponding equation for the pre-
ceding December, the domestic share /C12jis pro-
duced as follows
(5) . /C12j¼Sdec;j/C0Sfeb;j þ1
Sd
dec;j/C0Sd
feb;j þ1
The seasonal component of the stock of euro
banknotes held in Germany, Sd, in equation (5)
is unknown and must be estimated. Here it is es-
timated using the seasonal term of banknotes in
circulation in a reference country, the seasonal
component of a transactions variable as well as
the seasonal term of banks’ cash holdings. In the
second case, the amount of cash being hoarded
domestically can also be determined by taking
into account the domestic income elasticity
(transactions elasticity) of the demand for bank-
notes, /C17. Equation (5) can then be rewritten as
(6) , /C12j¼Sdec;j/C0Sfeb;j þ1
Sd
dec;j/C0Sd
feb;j þ1¼Sdec;j/C0Sfeb;j þ1
/C17/C1/C1SðtrÞ
where /C1SðtrÞstands for the difference between
the seasonal high and the seasonal low of the
transactions variable.

37for banknotes. This then enables the total
volume of Bundesbank-issued euro bank-notes held outside Germany (both inside andoutside the euro area) to be derived. Thisvolume has been increasing since 2002 andamounted to approximately €250 billion atthe end of 2009 (see the chart on page 38).
After taking into account the results from the
method using France as a reference country,the cumulated net export of euro banknotesfrom Germany to other euro-area countries(cumulated domestic migration) thusamounts to €90 billion.
The third method of determining the sea-
sonal component of the Bundesbank-issuedeuro banknotes in circulation in Germanyuses the seasonal structure of cash balancesheld by banks in Germany. As these cash bal-ances incur opportunity costs, they are keptto a minimum and result almost exclusivelyfrom regular domestic transactions. Domestichoarding and foreign demand have virtuallyno impact on banks’ cash balances. This ap-proach is used to determine the sum of totalforeign demand for German euro banknotesand the stock being hoarded in Germany,which is estimated to amount to €290 billion.This leaves an estimated residual of just under€60 billion for transaction demand fromhouseholds and enterprises in Germany.After deducting the estimated €250 billionfor total circulation outside Germany thatwas derived using the “transaction variable”method, this means that euro banknotes tothe value of approximately €40 billion werebeing hoarded in Germany at the end of2009.Indirect approach 2: estimating a bank-
note demand function
Another way of estimating circulation outside
Germany indirectly is to determine a functionfor purely domestic demand for Bundesbank-issued banknotes. France is once again select-ed as the reference country as it is com-parable with Germany in terms of domesticdemand for banknotes. Again it is assumedthat banknotes issued in France have little orno circulation outside the euro area, and thatthe domestic migration of banknotes issuedby the French and German central bankswithin the euro area is similar. However, thebanknote demand function does not includeany variables that capture this domestic mi-gration within the euro area. Germany’s totalcirculation beyond its borders can thus be

38calculated as the difference between the
Bundesbank’s cumulated net issuance of
euro banknotes and Germany’s domestic
circulation estimated using the banknote
demand function for France. According to
this estimate, total circulation outside Ger-
many has been rising continuously since
2002. At the end of 2009, the outstanding
volume of Bundesbank-issued banknotes out-
side Germany is put at between €210 billion
and €270 billion, with the point estimate at
€240 billion.
Indirect approach 3: information from
the introduction of euro cash
The size of domestic transaction balances,
and thus also the sum of foreign demand for
and domestic hoarding of Bundesbank-issuedeuro banknotes, can be estimated using the
growth in the volume of banknotes in circula-
tion in Germany around the time euro cash
was introduced. At the end of 2001, €77 bil-
lion of D-Mark banknotes were still in circula-
tion. After the first nine days of 2002, roughly
90% of domestic cash payments were al-
ready being made in euro.10The bulk of
transaction balances therefore appear to
have been converted by this time. The
remaining D-Mark banknotes to the value
of €47 billion that were still outstanding on
9 January 2002, less 10% that was still in use
for cash payments in D-Mark (€9 billion), are
consequently assignable to domestic hoard-
ing and foreign demand. This results in a
transaction balance of €38 billion in Germany
at the start of 2002. If this amount is extra-
polated with the growth rate for nominal
private consumption to the end of 2009, this
yields a domestic transaction balance of
around €40 billion. Thus at the end of 2009,
foreign demand and domestic hoarding to-
gether amounted to roughly €310 billion.
Indirect approach 4: implications from
the financial crisis
This method tests the robustness of the esti-
mate for domestic hoarding derived in the
first indirect method. In the wake of the sub-
prime crisis, the American investment bank
Lehman Brothers was forced to file for bank-
ruptcy in September 2008. This greatly unset-
tled the financial markets and triggered a
flight to safe and liquid assets, including cash.Estimated total volume of

40As a result of the crisis, the net issuance of
banknotes in Germany rose by €16 billion in
October 2008.11Half of this rise is attribut-
able to higher net shipments of euro bank-
notes to non-euro-area countries. An examin-
ation of the gross withdrawals of €500 bank-
notes (the denomination typically used by
hoarders) from the Bundesbank in October
2008 supports this hoarding hypothesis. In
that month, withdrawals were almost equally
divided between demand from Germany and
non-euro-area countries.12Hence during the
financial crisis, the demand for Bundesbank-
issued euro banknotes as a store of value
rose just as strongly in Germany as it did in
countries outside the euro area. Assuming
that residents of both Germany and non-
euro-area countries share the same average
hoarding behaviour, this implies that there
should be virtually no difference in the vol-
ume of Bundesbank-issued euro banknotes
hoarded in Germany and in non-euro-area
countries.
The stocks of banknotes hoarded outside the
euro area can be estimated using the “OeNB
euro survey” – a survey that has been con-
ducted by the Austrian central bank semi-
annually since autumn 2007. This survey
collects data about the volume of cash and
savings held in foreign currencies by house-
holds in central, east and south-east Euro-
pean countries. This implies that the ratio of
German euro banknotes being hoarded to
total foreign demand in non-euro-area coun-
tries (around €160 billion according to the
first indirect method) is around 70%. Thus
according to these calculations, the stock of
Bundesbank-issued euro banknotes beinghoarded in non-euro-area countries amount-
ed to over €110 billion at the end of 2009.
Under the aforementioned assumption that
both German and non-euro-area residents
exhibit the same average hoarding behaviour,
this likewise yields an estimated €110 billion
for domestic hoarding. This figure clearly
exceeds the estimate of €40 billion derived
residually in the first indirect approach.
Conclusions from the estimation results
Even after cash holdings had been replen-
ished at the end of 2003 following the intro-
duction of euro cash, the volume of German
euro banknotes outstanding continued to
grow strongly. The estimates presented in
this article have demonstrated that this
growth was primarily driven by foreign de-
mand. Conversely, the domestic share of the
Bundesbank’s cumulated net issuance of
euro banknotes has declined steadily and has
more than halved since 2002.
The results of all approaches at the current
end are summarised in the table on page 39.
When interpreting the results, it is important
to bear in mind that estimating the volume of
banknotes in circulation outside Germany is
difficult and subject to major uncertainty.
11This figure was calculated from the estimated coeffi-
cients of dummy variables for October 2008 in regARIMA
models for the cumulated net issuance of each banknote
denomination in Germany. According to these calcula-
tions, the following denominations increased significant-
ly: €50 banknotes (+€1.9 billion), €100 banknotes (+€3.0
billion), €200 banknotes (+€0.9 billion) and €500 bank-
notes (+€10.2 billion). In October 2008 the crisis thus
caused the circulation of these denominations to increase
by €16 billion overall.

41Although the approaches examined here vary
greatly and are independent of one another,the resulting estimates for banknotes heldoutside Germany are rather similar. They aretherefore likely to be a close approximationof the actual figures.
The point estimates for the breakdown of the
total demand for German euro banknotes atthe end of 2009 can be summarised asfollows. At 65% to 70%, foreign demandaccounted for the lion’s share of Germanbanknotes outstanding. Only roughly one-third of the Bundesbank’s net issuance ofeuro banknotes was used in Germany. Themajority of banknotes in circulation outsideGermany were in non-euro-area countries.All approaches put this figure at 45%.Germany is also a net exporter of euro bank-notes to other euro-area countries. The
cumulated domestic migration of euro bank-notes from Germany to other euro-areacountries is estimated at between 15% and25%. Domestic hoarding accounts for be-tween 10% and 30%. At 10% to 15%, theshare of Bundesbank-issued euro banknotesestimated as being held for domestic trans-action purposes is relatively small. Hence it isimportant that measures of the central bank’sdegree of participation in the national cashprocessing cycle are not based on the totaloutstanding stock of banknotes but are re-stricted to that portion held for domestic cashtransactions, that is the banknotes that actu-ally circulate in the national cash cycle and re-turn relatively quickly to the central bank forprocessing.

43Investor behaviour in theory and practice
The aftermath of the financial crisis was marked by sharp volatility in the financial markets, with
investors suffering, in some cases, significant financial losses. This affected not only individual
financial products, such as Lehman Brothers “certificates”, but entire asset classes. Investors
– particularly private investors – were extremely nervous in view of the losses they incurred and
the emerging evidence of mispricing in the financial markets. Developments that had already
started prior to the financial crisis likewise helped unsettle savers. For instance, innumerable
innovative but often also very complex financial products have made investment an increasingly
challenging endeavour. Investors can now choose from a multitude of derivative structures,
which, at least in theory, allow improved risk diversification by expanding the investment
universe. However, they frequently entail risks that are often difficult to identify and to quantify.
Phenomena such as nervous market participants or complex financial products or decisions are
not fully addressed by classical finance theory, which assumes a completely rational agent ( homo
economicus ). However, this simplification – though useful for constructing models – frequently
fails to adequately describe and explain typical behaviour patterns for investment decisions,
which often adversely affect portfolio returns. Yet by looking at behavioural approaches
(behavioural finance), researchers can analyse capital market phenomena which classical finance
theory cannot explain. These include the empirically well-documented lack of diversification in
investors’ portfolios as well as the frequently observed excessive trading by investors.
Moreover, findings from classical theory and observations by behavioural finance researchers
both have normative implications for investment decisions. One area is portfolio structure. The
investment axiom known from classical finance theory of sufficiently diversifying the portfolio is
not fundamentally altered by the findings from behavioural finance research. On the other hand,
there are certainly benefits in probing the motives for buying and selling securities. In this context
it is worth asking whether or not outperforming the “average market player” over the long term
is realistic. Active investment strategies appear to make sense only if the answer to this question
is yes. Lastly, insufficient attention is often devoted to the decisive role of cost structures in the
choice of investment instrument – to purchase securities directly or buy broadly diversified invest-
ment vehicles. Furthermore, normative implications from the findings of behavioural finance
research are being incorporated into regulatory plans to improve investor protection.

44Behavioural finance: an overview
The study of market participants’ behaviour
patterns has come to be known as “behav-
ioural finance”. The so-called “behavioural
approach” sets out to describe events in the
financial markets using behavioural assump-
tions that are as close to reality as possible.1
In contrast to the efficient markets hypothesis
of classical finance theory, behavioural fi-
nance explains price discovery in the financial
markets as a function not only of economic
factors but also of the interplay between
economic, psychological and sociological
factors.
A fundamental element of behavioural fi-
nance which departs from classical theory
(see box on page 45) is developing more real-
istic model premises.2Behavioural finance
looks at the processes involved in selecting,
absorbing and processing information that is
relevant for decision-making and at how
investors form expectations and make deci-
sions. The behavioural approach draws spe-
cifically on knowledge from other areas of
science, such as psychology.3
Unlike the typical investor in classical finance
theory, the behavioural finance investor does
not meet the extremely strict rationality
assumptions of a homo economicus .4The
behavioural finance approach recognises that
individuals are not able to process informa-
tion at the same time and often do not evalu-
ate it systematically, either. They allow their
decisions to be swayed by, for instance, irrele-
vant details, and often make their investment
decisions with the help of rules of thumb.Furthermore, investors may act contrary to
their actual – or assumed – preferences and
are influenced by ethical or emotional con-
siderations (such as fairness or status).
Behavioural approaches thus drop the idea of
a well-informed, entirely self-interested and
fully rational homo economicus .
One important outcome of behavioural fi-
nance research is that market inefficiencies
and stubborn price distortions can exist even
in markets with rational agents. This “limits
to arbitrage” argument5is at odds with trad-
itional theory, which posits that prices can
only temporarily deviate from the fundamen-
tal value of a good since, even if some invest-
ors do not act rationally, the (fully) rational
investors will always rapidly restore the fair
price through “arbitrage”.6Various studies
show, however, that market developments
which cannot be explained by the fundamen-
tals can have a significant and long-lived

6Arbitrage denotes the practice of taking advantage of
price differences in different markets to make a profit.
Arbitrage transactions are riskless if an identical financial
product is purchased and sold at the same time and
there is no counterparty risk (such as credit risk on the
part of the financial intermediary). In some cases, enter-
ing into contrary positions in (supposedly) similar financial
products is also referred to as arbitrage. Such trans-
actions are then by definition risky.Behavioural

45Classical finance theory, the efficient markets hypothesis and the concept of the
discerning and responsible investor
Rational investors represent the main cornerstone
of classical finance theory. They are considered toform expectations and take decisions in a strictlyrational way. That means that they will choose theoption that maximises their personal benefit. Interms of model theory, they will maximise expectedutility. The homo economicus defined in this way
has a clear, complete and consistent order of prefer-ences, knows the entire set of options and is able,considering all information, to assess to what de-gree each option will help him achieve his object-ive. Moreover, the theory postulates that investorsare able reliably to quantify the risks they haveentered into and to take full account of transactioncosts. Ultimately, all market players have a “cor-rect” and therefore identical decision-makingmodel under this framework. In these simplemodels, access to information is considered to befree and unlimited.
Fama (1970) links the theory of rational expect-
ations with the assumption of informationally effi-cient capital markets. Here, to varying degrees,prices directly, fully and correctly reflect any avail-able information that is relevant for valuing anasset.
1These markets exhibit no informational ad-
vantages that would allow an investor to achieve ahigher return at the same level of risk in the longterm (or a lower level of risk for the same return).As such markets incorporate all available informa-tion, the quoted price will theoretically alwaysequate to the “fair” or fundamental value. This rep-resents the present value of all future net cash flowsthat the investor can expect from ownership of theasset. Price fluctuations can therefore only be
brought about by new information that no marketplayer expects.
The assumption of rational investors and efficient
markets is very ambitious and can, in reality, onlyever be fulfilled approximately; nonetheless, itbasically represents a suitable and common frame-work for financial market models. However, therecent financial crisis is just one of a number ofevents that have revealed the limitations of thesemodels’ explanatory power, as classical financetheory is unable, or only partially able, to explainfinancial market players’ behaviour.
Nonetheless, regulatory considerations regarding
financial consumer protection are often based onthe concept, derived from classical finance theory,of the homo economicus .
2Central to this concept is
the overcoming of information asymmetries be-tween suppliers and/or agents on the one hand andinvestors on the other. The objective is to strength-en consumers’ position by improving the supply ofinformation, enabling them to take considered in-vestment decisions that match their goals and possi-bilities. This regulatory approach is characterised, inparticular, by information and disclosure require-ments vis-à-vis consumers for suppliers, such as thepublication of prospectuses and product infor-mation as well as the disclosure of conflicts of inter-est. This approach is, in practice, complemented,amongst others, by measures to strengthen theenforceability of consumers’ legal rights and mar-ket supervision of financial services providers.
1Fama distinguishes between three forms of information
efficiency. Under the strong form, the price fully and cor-rectly reflects all information. The semi-strong form ispresent where the price reflects all publicly available infor-mation. The weak form is characterised by the fact that theprice reflects only that information contained in historicalsecurities prices. See E F Fama (1970), Efficient capital mar-kets: a review of theory and empirical work, in Journal ofFinance, Vol 25, pp 383-417. — 2“Our model is the well-
informed, discerning consumer who is able to act in a self-determined manner.

46impact on prices, which cannot be explained
solely by transaction costs.7A lengthy period
of securities undervaluation or overvaluation
is possible, for instance, in markets in which
“noise traders,”8as a group of non-
fundamental investors, have driven an instru-
ment’s market price so far from its fair value
that even rational agents are unable to
correct this mispricing in the short term. The
decisive factor is that no riskless arbitrage
strategies exist in practice, which means that
even fundamentally-oriented investors can-
not maintain positions indefinitely and may
therefore be compelled to realise losses.
Investor behaviour, explanatory
approaches and normative implications
This section presents typical patterns of
investor behaviour and the approaches used
to explain them. It turns out that investors
sometimes behave in ways that are detrimen-
tal to the returns on their portfolios.
Investors’ portfolios often comprise only a
few asset classes, and within the various
classes, wealth is often spread over a small
number of securities.9As a consequence,
many investors, by more broadly diversifying
their assets, could reduce their risk without
seeing average returns reduced over time.10
Portfolio underdiversification is an inter-
national phenomenon, of which ample
evidence also exists for Germany. According
to a survey conducted in 2006 by the German
Socioeconomic Panel, some 46% of German
households held only two to three differentinvestment products. A further notable result
is that around one household in five has just
one investment product in its portfolio. The
most popular investment forms are standard
products such as savings books, life insurance
policies or savings and loan contracts. By con-
trast, investing directly in shares or fixed-
income securities frequently plays little or no
role in wealth accumulation. According to
this survey, over 70% of households held no
shares and around 85% no bonds.11A survey
by the Deutsches Aktieninstitut (DAI), a share-
holder lobby association, on the number of
investors who hold shares or mutual funds
arrives at somewhat different figures to the
German Socioeconomic Panel yet confirms the
overall impression that shares are relatively
unimportant as an investment vehicle for
German investors.12According to its survey, in
2008 only around 8.6 million investors held

8Noise traders are investors whose investment decisions
are not based on fundamentals. Black distinguishes
between noise and “news”, or information, with only
the latter having any bearing on the company’s funda-
mental value. See F Black (1986), Noise, in Journal of
Finance, Vol 41, pp 529-543.

investors could increase their average returns without
having to take greater risks.

47shares or mutual funds, with the figure trend-
ing downwards. That represented 13.3% ofthe population. An evaluation of Bundesbankdata on the financial wealth of households(and non-profit institutions serving house-holds) in 2009 yields similar results.
13Accord-
ing to this, only 3.9% of wealth is held direct-ly in shares (however, the trend is slightlypositive).
14
Investors often spread their wealth not justacross a limited number of asset classes, theydo not behave (fully) rationally when spread-ing their wealth among the various asset cat-egories either. For instance, they frequentlytend towards “naïve” diversification.
15This is
when portfolio composition is not based onfully rational considerations but is more orless arbitrary – such as by using rules ofthumb (“heuristics”
16). A rule of thumb on
which investment decisions are often based isthe so-called “1/n” heuristics.
17Agents in-
vesting according to this method allocatetheir assets equally across those asset classesor securities with which they are familiar or ofwhich they are aware at the time of theirinvestment decision. One graphic examplecan be observed in the United States. There,employers frequently offer their employeesmutual fund investment plans to save forretirement. The firm preselects various mu-tual funds, from which the employer canthen choose. The preselection is found tohave a significant influence on what fundsinvestors actually choose
18since their invest-
ment decisions often “mimic” the firm’s pre-selection. Whereas, for instance, employeesoffered four share-based funds and only onebond-based fund invested an average of75% of their money in shares, those offered
one share-based fund and four bond-basedfunds – the exact reverse – invested an aver-age of only 34% of their money in share-based funds.
19
Another reason why many portfolios are notvery highly diversified is that they are exces-sively focused on their home market (homebias) – in other words, a disproportionatelylarge percentage of securities in many invest-ors’ portfolios are domestic. Although capitalmarket liberalisation and the introduction ofthe single currency in Europe have sharply re-duced the home bias, domestic investmentvehicles remain distinctly overrepresented.For equities in nearly all euro-area countries,the average percentage share of investmentin the domestic market dropped significantlyfrom 84% to around 59% between 1991

Germany 1991 to 2009, Special Statistical Publication 4,

14Moreover, 11.9% of assets were invested in mutual
funds which, in turn, were partly invested in shares.

fication strategies in defined contribution saving plans, in

tics see eg R Shiller (2001), Human behavior and the effi-

the investment universe of an investor composed, for
instance, of “shares” and “bonds”, n would equal 2.
People investing their assets according to 1/n heuristics
would place 50% (=1/2) of their funds in shares and the
other 50% in bonds.
18This phenomenon is known as the “framing effect”. It
is present if how a decision is framed influences people’s
behaviour in a predictable manner. See A Tversky and
D Kahneman (1981), The Framing of Decisions and the
Psychology of Choice, in Science, New Series, pp 453-

48and 2007. For debt securities, the bias to-
wards domestic paper also decreased, from
91 % to 58%.20
The main reason given for the home bias is
that the transaction and information costs of
investing in foreign instruments are usually
higher. However, transaction costs alone are
generally not enough to explain the over-
whelming preference for domestic securities.
Although investors often do not have better
information on their home market, they still
appear to feel more capable of assessing
domestic economic developments.21How-
ever, the preference for domestic paper
should not always be regarded as irrational:
for instance, the legal framework still varies
from country to country, in some cases con-
siderably. As a case in point, the settlement
of cross-border depositor compensation
claims revealed regulatory gaps.
In addition, empirical observations indicate
that the higher transaction costs generated
by frequent trading are, on average, not off-
set by higher returns.22This phenomenon,
also seen frequently among private investors,
can be associated with individuals’ tendency
to overestimate their own possibilities and
abilities – including their ability to make
sound predictions. Overconfidence is an
emotional factor which, according to psycho-
logical research, affects expectation forma-
tion.23One manifestation of it is that people,
when making forecasts, frequently underesti-
mate the degree of uncertainty.
In the real world, much trading seems to be
motivated by different interpretations ofwhat is often the same information.24In this
context, therefore, overconfidence is a major
factor in explaining excessive trading – in
terms of the returns generated after deduct-
ing trading costs – and the pursuit of active
trading strategies.
The phenomenon of investors tending to sell
securities that have appreciated since they
bought them (“winners”) more quickly than
those whose price has depreciated since their
purchase (“losers”) is called the disposition
effect. Losers are thus held for a relatively
long time, while winners are sold relatively
quickly. What makes this noteworthy is that
the purchase price – apart from tax consider-
ations25– ought not to be a factor in the
decision to sell; only the investor’s assessment
of the paper’s future performance should
matter.
20See Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, Decem-
ber 2009, pp 37-39. The German home bias occupies a
mid-table position among euro-area countries, though
the decline is due chiefly to the increase in the import-
ance of non-resident mutual funds.

25The purchase price matters to some extent when tak-
ing an after-tax view, since the tax gain or loss is general-
ly linked to the purchase price. It might therefore make
sense, in some cases, for the investor to realise a price
loss if it can be set off against taxable gains. However,
this would imply behaviour that runs exactly counter to
the disposition effect observed among investors.Investors trade

49Various approaches are used to explain the
disposition effect.26One way of explaining it
is, for instance, using what is called “prospecttheory”.
27Prospect theory is based on a valu-
ation function that measures the utility of aninvestment not in terms of its (expected)absolute value, as with a normal utility func-tion, but in terms of price performance. Itthus postulates an effect known as “anchor-ing”.
28Anchoring denotes the selection of
what is essentially an arbitrary referencevalue – often the purchase price of a security.The choice of anchor influences the investor’sperception, since whether an investment isseen as winning or losing depends on thatanchor. Whereas individuals are risk aversewhen their shares are “winning” – as perstandard utility functions – they are risk seek-ers when losing.
29The disposition effect can
be explained by the assumption that such avalue function exists. Investors attribute lessvalue to the possibility of further gains onsecurities
30that are already “winning” rela-
tive to potential losses, leading them often tosell these winners relatively quickly.
Another avenue towards explaining the
disposition effect is what is known as regretavoidance. This refers to the human ten-dency to seek to avoid negative emotionswherever possible. Accordingly, the typicalinvestor is tempted to avoid the negativeemotions associated with selling an equityinvestment at a loss by putting off thedecision. The negative emotions are gener-ated because the loss is realised upon saleand must then, if not beforehand, be“mentally accounted” for.
31This behaviour,
however, is not rational, as the purchaseprice is a wholly irrelevant reference price for
future performance and the “damage” isalready done, irrespective of whether theinvestor decides to sell or hold.
On the financial markets, investors frequently
mimic one another, behaviour which classicalfinance theory cannot explain. This is de-scribed as herding, or herding behaviour.
32
Herding can cause problems since it canmake financial markets more volatile andfeed speculative bubbles, such as the recentlyburst real-estate bubble in the United States.There are various approaches to explainingimitation, in which agents’ behaviour can be

ition effect to sell winners too early and ride losers too

effect see N Barberis and W Xiong (2009), What Drives

29Put simply: the pain of losing €200 is not twice as
great as that of losing €100 but disproportionately less.

but can also occur with other securities classes. For more

32There are also rational grounds for herd behaviour,
however. If investors, for example, react similarly to new
information and reassess their portfolios accordingly, this
can lead to similar trading activity (spurious herding).

50individually rational but can collectively create
inefficient solutions.33
Information cascades are one possible explan-
ation for herding behaviour. Investors base
their decisions on those of other market play-
ers, which they copy. In doing so, they follow
other investors’ decisions to buy or sell blind-
ly, ie with no thought as to whether prices
are fundamentally justified. If investors make
the same investment one after the other,
they can ratchet prices up. Price develop-
ments then no longer reflect new information
in the strict sense but only some market
players imitating the decision of others. For
investors, imitation involves low information
costs, but investment decisions are taken
without a valuation of their own.
An additional approach assumes reputation-
based herding, in which it may be rational for
fund managers or analysts to follow the herd
in their investments or forecasts. If price de-
velopments are negative, they do not have to
fear any extraordinary loss of reputation as
long as they do not significantly underper-
form their peers. In case of a misjudgement,
a large number of other market participants
will have made the same mistake.34Such
individually rational behaviour can lead to
market prices that are incompatible with the
underlying fundamentals. Herding behaviour
is also created automatically, as it were, by
correlated inflows and outflows to funds. If
market agents invest in such funds based on
past performance, prices will rise without any
fundamental justification.35The behaviour patterns described in the pre-
ceding sections impact directly on investors
by possibly reducing their wealth and thus
their consumption options. Investors are also
indirectly affected by their behaviour and that
of other market players since the phenomena
described by behavioural finance can impair
the proper functioning of the market mech-
anism and thus lead to misallocation of
capital and instability. Phenomena such as
herding behaviour are capable of making the
financial system more volatile at macro level,
potentially exacerbating crises. For instance,
the bursting of resultant asset price bubbles
can make it more difficult for the economies
affected to return to a solid growth path.
Since misallocation and instability are associ-
ated with welfare losses, greater prudence
among market players could be expected to
lead to a less crisis-prone financial system,
higher growth rates and thus greater overall
economic wealth.
However, individual investment mistakes can
be reduced by acquiring the relevant financial
knowledge, as financial education allows in-

51vestors to detect and avoid inefficiencies.36In
the following, three issues which are at theheart of every investment decision will be dis-cussed: the underlying portfolio structure, areview of the motivation to trade andthoughts on the cost structure.
Both the findings of classical theory and ob-
servations from behavioural finance researchare relevant for investors. Classical financetheory and behavioural finance take ondifferent “roles”. Whereas the positive (de-scriptive) behavioural finance shows whatbehaviour patterns investors tend to adopt,the normative (prescriptive) classical theoryformulates an ideal or optimal behaviour orinvestment outcome.
Portfolio underdiversification is a widespread
phenomenon among private investors andwell-documented in behavioural finance re-search. Given the importance of asset com-position for long-term investment success,
37
investors are well-advised to pay particularattention to portfolio structure (asset alloca-tion).
38
The recommendations on optimum asset allo-cation or portfolio diversification are derivedlargely from normative, ie prescriptive, clas-sical theory. In keeping with the underlyingtenets of Markowitz portfolio theory,
39the
investor must ensure that his portfolio in-cludes a sufficient number of asset classesand securities with different risk profiles;provided the instruments in the basket ofinvestments do not correlate perfectly, thefluctuations in the prices of individual secur-ities will partly offset one another and thusdampen the portfolio’s overall performance.
On balance, the performance of the overallbasket of investments will therefore besmoothed over time, and it will becomepossible to obtain, over time, higher averagereturns without changing the riskiness of theportfolio.
40
In the light of findings from behaviouralfinance research, investors should also alwaysquestion their motives for buying and sellingsecurities. For instance, many investors makethe mistake of trading too much (excessivetrading) or asymmetrically (disposition effect).
Investors should therefore be clear whether
they wish to pursue an active or passiveinvestment approach and ask themselves the
36Studies have confirmed the intuitive relationship be-
tween a sound financial education and individual invest-
ment success. See eg J C Campbell (2006), Household
Finance, in Journal of Finance, Vol 61, pp 1553-1604.
37For instance, variation of yields can be explained in
large part by strategic asset allocation. The effect of asset
allocation on the variation in the success of investment is
often around 90% in longitudinal comparisons (ie over
time). See eg G P Brinson, L R Hood and G L Beebower
(1986), Determinants of Portfolio Performance, in Finan-
cial Analysts Journal, pp 39-48, and D Blake, B N Leh-
mann and A Timmermann (1999), Asset Allocation
Dynamics and Pension Fund Performance, in Journal of
Business, Vol 72, pp 429-461. This approach is discussed
in, for instance, R G Ibbotson (2010), The Importance of
Asset Allocation, in Financial Analysts Journal, Vol 66,
pp 1-3.
38Private investors’ asset planning is a process in which
the individual’s assets are “translated” into a customised
strategic asset allocation taking into account investment
goals, preferences and special circumstances.
39See H Markowitz (1952), Portfolio selection, in Journal
of Finance, Vol 7, pp 77-91.
40The positive – ie descriptive – behavioural finance re-
search provides reasons why investors do not diversify
their portfolios sufficiently, in some cases. This does not
affect the fundamental advantages of diversification, for
the most part. However, behavioural finance also pro-
vides indications that assets could be more strongly cor-
related than suggested by classical finance theory. This
would have to be taken into account when assembling
the portfolio. On this, see N Barberis and R Thaler (2003),

52Active and passive asset management
In asset management – whether at the individual
level or, for instance, at investment fund level –
there are two different investment approaches. The
objective of so-called passive management is to
track the targeted portfolio – for instance, a repre-
sentative market index1– as closely as possible. By
contrast, an active asset manager will try to outper-
form the benchmark portfolio, for example by over-
weighting (or underweighting) individual stocks or
specific asset classes as compared to the benchmark
portfolio because he or she believes that they will
outperform (or underperform) the market – in
other words, the relevant benchmark portfolio.
Active strategies may be successful if, for instance,
mispricing is recognised as such. Behavioural fi-
nance studies show that examples of such market
inefficiencies do indeed exist. However, the pres-
ence of inefficiencies in itself does not guarantee
that they can be exploited profitably, as there is no
riskless arbitrage (see the “limits to arbitrage” argu-
ments set out on pages 44-46). Even correctly iden-
tified mispricing may result in losses if this deviation
from fair value does not correct itself “automatical-
ly”. In such a situation, even rational market players
that recognise a market inefficiency and bet on its
correction would lose out.
Moreover, active management is similar to a zero-
sum game in that one investor’s gain is another’s
loss.2That means that all investors’ gains versus thebenchmark portfolio will add up to zero – before
factoring in the costs of active management. After
costs, the total return on all active portfolios is
therefore lower than that on the benchmark port-
folio. Cost considerations are an important factor in
active asset management mandates, as these tend
to be associated with greater costs than passive
mandates.3
In principle, retail investors could also decide to
actively manage their wealth themselves. To be suc-
cessful, they would have to be able systematically
to identify and exploit market inefficiencies. This is
very difficult as they would be competing with a
large number of professional asset managers who
themselves frequently have difficulty delivering the
promised excess returns. Empirical studies, for in-
stance, regularly confirm theoretical considerations
that active mandates are, in the aggregate, unable
to beat their benchmark index in the long run.4
However, individual managers do outperform their
benchmark portfolios year after year. Indeed, asset
managers that have performed particularly well in
the past frequently also achieve an exceptionally
good result in the following year.5However, it is
contentious to what degree this effect can be at-
tributed solely to the competence of the asset man-
ager.6Again, one may ask whether typical retail in-
vestors can identify successful asset managers and
assess the odds of them repeating past successes.
1Developments in a particular market or sector are fre-
quently measured based on the performance of indices. A
market index compresses the performance of a selection of
securities into a single figure, the index level. A distinction
is made between price and total return indices. While the
former only reflect current prices, the latter include all
cash flows. This might mean dividend payments for an
equity index or coupon payments for a bond index. —
2See W F Sharpe (1991), The Arithmetic of Active Manage-
ment, in Financial Analysts Journal, Vol 47, pp 7-9. How-
ever, market players who pursue active approaches tend to
increase liquidity on the relevant markets. All market play-
ers benefit from the lower transaction costs this causes. —
3Active approaches are generally more resource-intensive
than passive mandates, as resources are required for mar-
ket analyses and the associated infrastructure, for instance.
Active mandates therefore usually have higher manage-
ment fees. — 4See, for instance, R G Ibbotson and P DKaplan (2000), Does Asset Allocation Policy Explain 40, 90,

53related question of whether such a strategy
seems justified. Discussing the pros and cons
of active and passive management is predi-
cated on the fundamental question of
whether it is possible to “beat the market in
the long term” – and if so, what precondi-
tions have to be met (see box on page 52).
Investment success remains largely depend-
ent on the associated costs. Nonetheless,
investors often appear to fail to pay enough
attention to the costs associated with invest-
ment decisions, as is evidenced by many
investors’ overtrading, for instance.41One
source of costs is replicating the desired
portfolio structure, ie purchasing individual
securities (direct modelling)42or buying suit-
able investment products such as funds or
“certificates”43(indirect modelling). Costs
may, for instance, come in the form of
purchasing and selling fees, load fees in
the case of funds or the bid-ask spread.44
Moreover, administrative fees and possibly
performance-related remuneration might be
payable. On the other hand, a generally
broadly diversified portfolio can be achieved
in a transactions cost-efficient manner – be-
cause it involves only one transaction – by
purchasing an investment product which rep-
licates a broadly diversified market index or
which tries to beat it.45
The administrative fee can vary strongly
depending on the vehicle – active mandates
tend to be more expensive than passive
ones – and can have a significant impact on
wealth in the longer term.Behavioural finance and regulation
In principle, research findings in behavioural
finance can provide important ideas for law-
makers on how to improve investor protec-
tion through suitable regulation. Findings
from research on behavioural finance allow a
better assessment of the behaviour patterns
of economic agents and show potential
reasons why actual behaviour in investment
decisions differs from the idealised investor
behaviour in classical finance theory. One
possible conclusion could be that action is
needed – such as promoting financial educa-
tion. Another is that behavioural finance
research could also have direct implications in
terms of shaping prudential measures in that
regulation is used to take advantage of mar-
ket players’ behavioural tendencies or to
reduce or counteract behaviour patterns that
society regards as undesirable. As a case in
point, undesirable framing effects can be
combated by influencing the method and
41Other types of costs, such as administrative fees
for mutual funds, are often neglected. See B M Barber,
T Odean and L Zheng (1995), Out of Sight, Out of Mind:
The Effects of Expenses on Mutual Fund Flows, in Journal
of Business, Vol 78, pp 2095-2119.
42The costs of direct modelling are largely dependent
on investment style – implementing active strategies
generally requires more transactions than passive strat-
egies – and on the granularity (number of securities) in
the target portfolio.
43Mutual fund shares or certificates are bearer debt
securities issued by banks, which are subject to issuer
risk.
44Implicit costs such as the market impact – a negative
price development for the investor triggered by a large
buy or sell order – also count as transaction costs. How-
ever, for private investors they are usually smaller than
for institutional investors since the latter generally carry
out larger orders.

an index adjustment is performed by the manager of the

54form in which investors are supplied with
information.46
On the whole, however, increasing the use of
behavioural finance in regulatory plans is still
in its infancy. In particular, there are often no
concrete and empirically robust recommen-
dations on how to translate these insights
into regulatory practice; further research is
therefore necessary.47Nonetheless, insights
gained from behavioural science are increas-
ingly being taken into account in financial
market regulation. In November 2010, the
European Commission published the results
of a study on the behaviour of investors in
the retail segment along with relevant policy
implications.48The study finds, for instance,
that investors benefit from simplified and
standardised product information.
The latest measures and current proposals to
strengthen investor protection in Germany
also reveal the influence of behavioural
science in the financial markets. As a case in
point, the Federal Government’s draft legis-
lation to protect investors and improve the
functioning of the capital markets49currently
under discussion provides for a standardised
product information sheet in which product
information is disclosed in a clear and concise
form. The product information sheet is
intended to inform investors about the type
of product, how it works, its risks, the
prospects for repayment and returns and the
associated costs. The central feature is themateriality of the information; such sheets do
not claim to be exhaustive, as is, for instance,
characteristic of the comprehensive prospec-
tus. This ties in with the finding from behav-
ioural finance research that the method of
presentation and the amount of information
provided can significantly influence investors’
perceptions. By tailoring the information to
its target audience, the product information
sheet is intended to reduce information
asymmetries, taking into account limited
rationality.50
Strengthening such regulatory efforts at in-
vestor level is an additional way of making
the financial system as a whole and the
macroeconomic framework more stable.
These regulatory initiatives at the micro level
of individual investors therefore complement
the current raft of regulatory initiatives in
banking supervision and financial market
regulation that was inspired by the financial
crisis.

55Requirements regarding the cyclical adjustment
procedure under the new debt rule
The reform of the public debt incurrence rules, which was adopted in 2009 with a broad consen-
sus of both houses of parliament (Bundestag and Bundesrat), provides a good basis for achieving
sound public finances in Germany. In the light of past experience, it is particularly important
when implementing this reform to rigorously adhere to the objective of strictly curbing new bor-
rowing. Thus, in accordance with the legislative intent, the upper bound of the deficit reduction
path up to 2015 should be lowered in line with the more favourable macroeconomic and fiscal
outturn for 2010 so as not to create additional scope for government borrowing. When it comes
to cyclical adjustment, the cyclical components of the budget gauged at respective points in time
must achieve a symmetrical balance over the course of the business cycle. Another requirement
is to ensure the transparency and verifiability of the calculations by publishing in full the relevant
methods and data in a clear and timely manner and avoiding discretionary ad hoc adjustments of
the calculation methods. Now that the new constitutional debt rule has been deployed for the
first time to draw up the 2011 central government budget, it would therefore seem appropriate
to significantly enhance the transparency of the cyclical adjustment procedure.
The cyclical adjustment procedure used at the European level was recently modified. In view of
the associated objectives, it would appear questionable, however, whether that adjustment is
suitable for the German debt rule and should be adopted as planned commencing with the 2012
central government budget. The procedure is relatively complex, opaque and elastic on account
of the numerous discretionary modelling options. For this reason, it would be preferable to retain
the comparatively straightforward adjustment procedure used for the 2011 central government
budget. A key prerequisite of any methodological changeover is to ensure that government
borrowing does not as a result overshoot the limits defined by the budget rule in the long run.
Another important point to note is that, irrespective of the cyclical adjustment procedure used,
the medium-term budgetary outlook is subject to considerable estimation uncertainty. In order
to accommodate unforeseen budgetary burdens within the prescribed borrowing limits without
resorting to short-term and mostly procyclical adjustments, the constitutional limit for govern-
ment borrowing should not be fully exhausted as a rule. Instead, a provision for unexpected
developments should be factored into the target figure in the form of an adequate safety mar-
gin.

56Background
Over the past few decades, the government
debt-to-GDP ratio in Germany has risen more
or less continuously and has now reached a
very high level. Parallel to this, the stock of
net government assets has been depleted.1
The new German budgetary rules present an
opportunity to halt this development and ini-
tiate a reversal, not least to take account of
the foreseeable demographic burdens. In
order to achieve the objective of sustainable
public finances and to lend the rules credibil-
ity, rigorous implementation will now be key.
Given the existing leeway for interpreting and
implementing the rules, it will be crucial to
adhere to their unambiguously formulated
objective of curbing public debt. It would
thus be a cause for concern if, in the very first
year of the rule’s deployment within the
transitional period up to 2015, the scope for
borrowing were to be enlarged by not adjust-
ing the consolidation path for the structural
deficit to the considerably more favourable
macroeconomic and fiscal outturn of 2010.2
Moreover, the rules will have to be applied in
a transparent and comprehensible fashion so
as not to jeopardise their acceptance and
enable effective monitoring by parliament
and the general public. All this places special
demands on the cyclical adjustment proced-
ure under the debt rule.
Requirements regarding the cyclical
adjustment procedure
The debt rule stipulates that, from 2016 on-
wards, central government’s structural netborrowing, ie after adjustment for cyclical
effects and financial transactions, may, as a
rule, not exceed 0.35% of nominal GDP.
During the transitional period from 2011 to
2015, the upper limit for structural new
borrowing will decrease to this target in
graduated steps, starting from the level in the
base year 2010. Cyclical effects during the
upturn and subsequent downturn are to be
taken into account symmetrically in order to
prevent permanent debt growth resulting
from a prevalence of cyclical deficits.3
The sub-constitutional specification of the
constitutional rule states that cyclical adjust-
ment is to be performed in line with the pro-
cedure used in the European Stability and
Growth Pact. Under this method, the cyclical
component of the general government
budget balance is the product of the output
gap and budget sensitivity, whereby the latter
gauges the impact of cyclical fluctuations in
GDP on the budget balance. The output gap
is defined as the deviation of GDP from po-
tential output and thus serves as a measure
of the economy’s cyclical position. Unobserv-
able potential output must then be estimated

57at the budget drafting stage based on the
available information.4
In view of the stated objective of the new
budgetary rules, namely to combat the
propensity to borrow that is inherent in the
political budgetary process, the procedure
for estimating potential output needs to
satisfy a number of specific requirements. It
is crucial that the constitutional requirement
of symmetrical output gaps calculated on
this basis is safeguarded. Here, it is also
necessary to consider the effects that dis-
cretionary parameter changes as well as
methodological innovations have on the
cyclical components gauged in real time
and assigned to the respective budget
plans. In this context it is important to
avoid making parameter and methodological
changes that would induce asymmetries. It
is also essential to ensure that the legislative
intent of the rule is not undermined by debt
accumulation wrongly labelled as being cyc-
lically induced. This problem is likely to be
particularly large in the case of procedures for
estimating potential output that embrace
very long cycles, such as when a methodo-
logically induced downward adjustment of
cyclical effects is carried out during protract-
ed periods of capacity overutilisation but is
not matched by a corresponding methodo-
logical adjustment during phases of under-
utilisation.
Another key need is to safeguard transpar-
ency and verifiability. If the estimation results
are to be properly verified it is necessary to
publish in full the information needed (in par-
ticular, the data, programs, documentationof methodological changes or modifications
of the model specification) in a clear and
timely manner5and to avoid discretionary
modelling.
Central government cyclical adjustment
in practice
Last year, the new debt rule was applied for
the first time when preparing the 2011 cen-
tral government budget, making it possible
to gain initial experience. The public availabil-
ity of the information needed to derive the
results of the cyclical adjustment was initially
limited. In this respect, it would be desirable
to document the relevant information in a
more comprehensive and institutionalised
manner.
The cyclical adjustment procedure used at
the European level was recently changed. In
view of the associated objectives, it would
appear questionable, however, whether that
4See section 5 of the Act implementing Article 115.
However, the estimation of potential output is not up-
dated for supplementary budgets or when being booked
to the control account at budget outturn (see sections 7
and 8 of the Act implementing Article 115). Budget sen-
sitivity, too, has to be estimated, with its value being
based on the budget surveillance procedure used under
the European Stability and Growth Pact, see section 2 (3)
of the Ausführungsverordnung zur Bestimmung der
Konjunkturkomponente (Regulation on determining
the cyclical component – available in German only) and
N Girouard and C André (2005), Measuring cyclically-
adjusted budget balances for OECD countries, OECD
Economics Department Working Paper, No 434. The esti-
mates of budget sensitivity are, however, relatively stable
over time and in most cases only need to be updated
intermittently. For this reason, the symmetry requirement
hinges largely on the estimates of the output gap.
5This information should be made available no later
than when the draft budget is submitted, not least in
order to facilitate consideration of the impact of reassess-
ments of the macroeconomic development at a later
stage in the budget drafting procedure.Specific require-

58recent methodological adjustment is suitable
for the German debt rule and should be
adopted, as is apparently planned, commen-
cing with the 2012 central government
budget.6The EU procedure estimates poten-
tial output on the basis of an aggregated
production function. The GDP trend path is
determined by linking the potential values
of labour and capital, taking into account a
productivity trend which is measured as
the trend component of total factor product-
ivity (TFP). The estimation result depends
on the specification of the production func-
tion and, in particular, on the smoothing of
the input components. The potential labour
input and, more recently, the TFP trend
component are determined at EU level using
highly complex model approaches. These
offer numerous discretionary modelling op-
tions and allow a variety of parameter set-
tings which can produce discernible differ-
ences in the estimation results. Since it is
hardly possible to objectify the choice of the
concrete specification, especially at the
current end, the same holds true for esti-
mates of the output gap as a key variable in
determining the cyclically adjusted deficit.
Furthermore, GDP cycles can become very
long under this procedure. For instance, Euro-
pean Commission estimation results from
autumn 2010 indicate uninterrupted periods
of aggregate overutilisation spanning ten
years for France or 13 years in the case of the
United Kingdom.7
As detailed in the box on page 59, the
concrete change in methodology at EU level
is also an example of how the symmetry of
estimated output gaps can be jeopardised inreal time if these modifications predominantly
cause downward revisions at the current end
(ie a smaller cyclically induced surplus or a
larger cyclically induced deficit). In general,
therefore, methodological changes should
be made rarely, be warranted by major im-
provements in the estimation method and
not impair the latter’s transparency and
verifiability. To prevent systematic enlarge-
ments of the scope for borrowing at the cur-
rent end through methodological changes,
it would, moreover, be necessary to retro-
actively record corresponding revaluations of
past structural deficits on the control account
up to the year in which the debt rule was
launched.8
Given the above considerations, it would
seem advisable for cyclical adjustment within
the central government debt rule to apply
the EU procedure in the form previously used
for the 2011 budget. For the purpose of
smoothing the time series of variables which
are relevant in the production function, exclu-
sive use was made of the comparatively
transparent Hodrick-Prescott filter. Over time,
this yields sufficiently symmetric cyclical
components on the input side, which in the
given model context is the precondition for
ensuring that the required symmetry is also
likely to be achieved for the resulting esti-

8As a rule, the final recording for a fiscal year is made in
September of the following year. In the event of meth-
odological changeovers, however, it would be necessary
to revalue the deviations from the upper limit accumu-
lated in the control account in order to safeguard the
legislative intent behind the rule.Methodological

59mation of the output gap. Furthermore, this
procedure would be transparent and verifi-
able and should therefore continue to be
used at least until the end of the transitional
period in 2016, which would also be meth-
odologically consistent. If a methodological
changeover were nonetheless to be intro-
duced during the transitional phase, it would
be necessary to at least calculate the bor-
rowing limit that is derived from the 2010
structural deficit for the period up to and
including 2015 using the new procedure, so
as to prevent an enlarged scope for govern-
ment borrowing in contravention of the legis-
lative intent behind the debt rule.9Failure to
do so would violate the rule’s legislative
intent in that it would create substantial add-
itional leeway for incurring debt, albeit on a
gradually declining scale, for the period up to
2015.
Steady fiscal policy requires forward
planning
Irrespective of the cyclical adjustment proced-
ure used, major estimation uncertainties exist
regarding the medium-term budget outlook,
and revisions owing to unforeseen develop-
ments are unavoidable. However, in order
not to be forced into very short-term consoli-
dation measures which mostly have a procy-
clical impact, the binding nature of the upper
borrowing limit should also be adhered to
Deutsche BundesbankResult of applying the old and new EU 
estimation method to Germany 
The chart below shows the European Commission’s 
output gap estimations for Germany from May 2010 
when results according to the old and new estima-
tion methods were provided simultaneously. It 
shows how the symmetry of the cyclical components 
of the budget gauged in real time can be impaired 
by a methodological change. If Germany’s new debt 
rule had applied since 1985, for instance, then a 
methodological change with the 2010 budget would 
allow larger cyclical deﬁ  cits at the current end, 
which would be only partially offset by allowing 
smaller cyclical deﬁ  cits on balance in the years up to 
2009. This is because the estimated output gaps dur-
ing the period 1985 to 2001 would be signiﬁ  cantly 
revised upwards. Consequently, applying the new 
method indicates that a commensurate excessive 
scope for borrowing was granted up to 2001 as the 
size of the negative cyclical effect was overstated 
up to that point in time by the old method. This 
overstated scope for borrowing up to 2001 is only 
partly offset by the fact that the new method would 
have indicated a higher cyclical scope for borrow-
ing between 2002 and 2009. Furthermore, the new 
method would permit an additional larger scope 
for borrowing from 2010 onwards, which would 
now be fully exploitable. To the extent that such 
future scope for borrowing were to be exploited 
without making offsetting adjustments for past 
years, a changeover to the new method would lead 
to additional debt accumulation in contravention of 
the legislative intent underlying the new debt rule, 
even though both methods exhibit the required 
symmetry of the cyclical components.
