5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
Following an extremely sharp increase in eco-
nomic output in the second quarter of 2010,
the upturn in the German economy weak-
ened considerably at the start of the third
quarter. The slower pace of growth in the
global economy had a calming effect on the
demand for industrial products, and the con-
struction sector has probably cleared most of
the weather-related backlogs accumulated
during the winter. The fact that the trend re-
covery may still be regarded as intact, how-
ever, is revealed, for example, by persistently
high export expectations, even though these
have been scaled back somewhat of late. This
should also continue to have a knock-on
effect on domestic business investment. The
planned tightening of capital requirements
for the banking sector is not expected to
have any major adverse effects on fixed cap-
ital formation. Given the favourable labour
market situation and consumers’ consider-
able optimism, private consumption will con-
tinue to pick up, especially as sales of private
passenger cars were increasing again slightly
of late.
Industry
Industrial output in July maintained the level
achieved in June, thereby exceeding the ex-
ceptionally dynamic second-quarter average
by just under 1%. Output of both intermedi-
ate and consumer goods was higher than in
June. By contrast, producers of capital goods
reduced their output slightly. While there wasWaning pace of

6a further increase in production in the mech-
anical engineering sector, which has not pro-
gressed as far, as well as in the electrical in-
dustry, output in the automotive sector was
adjusted downwards after exceptionally
strong growth in the second quarter. This
probably owed something to holiday effects.
Demand for industrial products abated in July
after having picked up sharply in the first half
of the year. There was a fall of 21/C254% com-
pared with June, in which several large orders
were placed for railway vehicles and aircraft.
Leaving aside this sector, there was a slight
seasonally adjusted increase of1/C252%, how-
ever. The intake of orders in July was un-
changed compared with the average of the
previous quarter. The flow of orders in the
intermediate goods sector improved by
13/C254%, but fell overall by 11/C254% in the case of
capital goods, although this was due mainly
to the aforementioned large orders. The up-
turn in the mechanical engineering sector
continued, and orders of motor vehicles also
increased slightly. From a regional perspec-
tive, the rise in export demand offset a mod-
erate decline at home. Orders from the euro
area increased somewhat more sharply than
those from non-euro area countries.
Real domestic sales of industrial goods in July
were 1% down on the month, but remained
unchanged on the second quarter. Export
sales were down by1/C252% on both the month
and the quarter. Nominal exports of goods in
July were 11/C252% below their June figure fol-
lowing the sharp rises of previous months.
Nevertheless, they were still 31/C254% up on the
second-quarter average. Imports of goodsEconomic conditions in Germany*

7also fell in July (-21/C254%). Compared with the
average of the previous quarter, there was an
increase of 3%. The foreign trade surplus
rose slightly to 3123/C254billion.
Construction
Construction output in July was 1% up on
the month in seasonal and calendar-adjustedterms, thus nearly matching the level of thesecond quarter. This applies to both the build-ing industry and civil engineering segments.There was a further decline in orders receivedin June (more recent data are currently un-
available). After adjustment for calendar vari-ations, they were 2% down on the year.
Labour marketThe labour market situation has shown a fur-
ther improvement. According to the provi-sional figures of the Federal Statistical Office,the seasonally adjusted number of persons inwork in July was 13,000 higher than in theprevious month. There was a year-on-year in-crease of 0.3%. According to initial estimatesfor June, employment subject to social secur-ity contributions increased again, albeit to alesser extent than in the previous threemonths. This rise was mainly attributable topart-time employment, but full-time employ-ment has increased recently, too. There was amarked decline in the scale of (cyclically in-duced) short-time work. According to initialestimates, it is likely to have fallen to 406,000in June (which is equivalent to 28% of thepeak in May 2009). Enterprises’ willingness torecruit new staff remains high. This is re-vealed by the Federal Employment Agency’sBA-X index, which showed a slight seasonally
adjusted increase in August, and by the Ifo
employment barometer, which has remainedin clearly expansionary territory.
Unemployment presents a similarly positive
picture. In August, the official unemployment
figure fell by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 to
3.19 million. There was a somewhat sharperfall in unemployment in the extended defin-ition. The unemployment rate (BA concept)remained at 7.6% in August, which was 0.7percentage point lower than in the sameperiod last year.
PricesThe sideways movement in crude oil prices
since May, accompanied at times by fairlystrong fluctuations, largely continued in Au-gust. A marked rise at the beginning of themonth was more than corrected in the weeksthat followed. At the end of the month,crude oil prices recovered slightly and, at theend of the period under review, were up ontheir average since the end of May. This wasdue primarily to changing market assess-ments concerning the future development ofthe global economy. At US$77
1/C254per barrel
on a monthly average, the spot price for
Brent North Sea oil in August was 23/C254%
higher than in July. Owing to appreciationagainst the US dollar, there was a somewhat
weaker increase of 1
3/C254% in euro terms. As
this report went to press, the spot price stood
at US$79. In the longer term, prices for future
deliveries of crude oil were once again being
quoted with somewhat lower premiums,Output and

8Deutsche BundesbankProgress towards Basel III – agreement on stricter minimum capital standards
On 12 September 2010, the central bank gov-
ernors and heads of supervision of the 27
most important financial economies agreed
on stricter minimum capital standards devel-
oped by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. Banks will, in future, hold more,
and better-quality, capital in order to improve
the stability of the financial system.
Appropriate transitional and grandfathering
arrangements during implementation are de-
signed to prevent banks from restricting lend-
ing, so overall economic growth is unlikely to
be impaired.
Specifically, it has been agreed that from
1 January 2019, after the transitional period,
banks will be required to have a core tier 1
capital ratio of 7%, composed of a minimum
common equity ratio of 4.5% plus a capital
conservation buffer of 2.5%. The overall tier 1
capital requirement (which comprises com-
mon equity and other qualifying financial
instruments plus the capital conservation
buffer) must amount to at least 8.5% and
the minimum total capital requirement (tier 1
capital also comprising capital conservation
buffer and tier 2 capital) will be 10.5% in
future. Moreover, the quality of capital will be
significantly improved, eg by stricter eligibility
criteria for capital instruments and more strin-
gent rules for regulatory adjustments (ie
deductions and prudential filters).
Countries must put in place the legal basis for
the new capital standards by the end of 2012;the EU will provide the legal framework via
the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV),
which will be transposed into German law.
The new capital ratios and the capital conser-
vation buffer will be phased in over a six-year
period starting on 1 January 2013. The new
deductions will be introduced in 20% steps
over a period of five years starting on 1 Janu-
ary 2014. Non-common equity tier 1 and tier 2
capital instruments that were issued before
12 September 2010 and do not meet the
future eligibility criteria will be gradually
phased out over a ten-year period ending in
2023. For non-joint stock companies, this pro-
cedure will be applied to all tier 1 and tier 2
capital instruments. Public-sector capital injec-
tions will be grandfathered for five years until
the beginning of 2018.
The agreed transitional and grandfathering
rules are very important for Germany as the
new rules will result in distinctly higher capital
requirements for domestic banks. In the Bun-
desbank’s opinion, German banks will be able
to raise the additional capital necessary to
meet capital ratios through earnings retention
and, if need be, capital increases without hav-
ing to deleverage at the expense of the real
economy.
The Bundesbank welcomes the fact that the
particular legal status of savings banks and
credit cooperatives has been taken into account
in drawing up the rules on equity composition.
Besides establishing a new definition of capi-
tal, the central bank governors and heads of

DEUTSCHE

9supervision also agreed on a date for the in-
troduction of two measures of liquidity risk.The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) covers a
time horizon of 30 days and measures a bank’s
stock of highly liquid assets in relation to itsnet payment obligations under a stressed sce-
nario. It is to be introduced on 1 January 2015.From 1 January 2018, the banks must alsomeet a medium-term funding ratio, the netstable funding ratio (NSFR), which is intendedto ensure that there are no inappropriate ma-turity mismatches between assets and liabil-ities over a one-year horizon.
The Bundesbank is, in principle, in favour of
introducing such internationally harmonisedindicators to measure liquidity risk. However,it is essential that the different market struc-tures and business models be given due con-sideration when designing the ratios.
On 12 September 2010, the central bank gov-
ernors and heads of supervision reiteratedtheir intention of introducing a leverage ratio
to limit bank debt incurrence as a reportingand observation indicator from 1 January
2013. In 2017, this ratio is to be reviewed in
the light of the experience made up until thatpoint and if necessary adjusted with a view to
introducing it as a binding instrument from2018. The Bundesbank underscores the needto review the leverage ratio in 2017 with anopen mind, paying particular attention to is-sues relating to accounting, different businessmodels and the treatment of off-balance-sheet items.
Overall, it is important that all countries in-
volved transpose the new rules into nationallaw punctually by the end of 2012 and thenintroduce them as planned; this is a pre-requisite for achieving the objective of theG20 Heads of State or Government ofstrengthening the international banking andfinancial system under level playing field con-ditions.

US$61/C254for 18-month deliveries.
At the upstream stages of the economy, up-
ward price pressure at the import level has
subsided of late, mainly owing to the euro’s
appreciation and lower crude oil prices in July.
However, the lagged effects of the earlier rise
in the prices of raw materials (reinforced by
the last depreciation of the euro) were mak-
ing themselves felt in domestic sales. There
was a month-on-month fall in import prices
in July for the first time since the second half
of 2009 by a seasonally adjusted 0.4%, com-
pared with -0.1% excluding energy. Never-
theless, the year-on-year rate went up further
to 9.9%. Prices in domestic sales of industrial
products in August were 0.1% up on July; ex-
cluding energy, they were 0.4% higher. The
year-on-year figure fell to 3.2%, however,
owing to base effects.
As in July, consumer prices in August rose
only slightly in seasonally adjusted terms, and
even fell somewhat for energy. Seasonal food
products became more expensive, but at a
noticeably weaker rate. Prices of other prod-
ucts were increased only slightly. Services
prices rose considerably due to the higher
cost of travel. The rise in rents remained mod-
erate. Overall, the annual rate of consumer
price inflation in August according to both
the national consumer price index (CPI) and
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
(HICP) was 1.0%, compared with 1.2% ac-
cording to both indices in July. One of the
factors behind this decline was that a very
sharp rise in energy prices 12 months earlier
no longer affected the annual rate.Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
The finances of the statutory health insurance
scheme are currently developing more fa-
vourably than expected. The health insurance
institutions recorded close-to-balance results
in the second quarter, as was the case in the
same period last year. Revenue growth of just
under 31/C252% was set against a rise in expend-
iture of just over 31/C252%. Overall, the increase
in spending on benefits continued to slow (to
31/C252% on the year – following 41/C252% in the
first quarter and almost 61/C252% in 2009). This
was aided by the fact that special factors,
such as higher remuneration of out-patient
treatment and additional expenditure as part
of the Hospital Financing Reform Act ( Kran-
kenhausfinanzierungsreformgesetz ), are no
longer exerting any further pressure on
spending. However, this improvement is also
due to a general slowdown in the pace at
which spending is increasing. Nevertheless,
growth in expenditure still far exceeds the rise
in income subject to compulsory insurance
contributions. At present, health insurance
institutions have been able to avoid putting
up contributions only because central govern-
ment has sharply increased its grants to the
health insurance fund which, in turn, has
been able to make larger transfers to the
institutions.
1In the short commentaries on public finances the em-
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of

11The health insurance fund recorded a surplus
of31/C252billion in the second quarter. Payments
to the health insurance institutions went up
by just over 3%. The sharp rise in revenue of
41/C252% was primarily due to the fact that cen-
tral government grants in the second quarter
were higher than in the same period last year.
A further contributory factor is that in 2010
central government funds2are being trans-
ferred in equal instalments of just under 34
billion per quarter, whereas in 2009 the tight
liquidity situation of the health insurance
fund meant that central government trans-fers had to be brought forward from the
second to the first quarter. Contributionreceipts fell by just under 2%. However, afteradjustment for the lowering of the generalcontribution rate in mid-2009 (from 15.5%to 14.9%), contribution receipts actually rose
by just over 2%, thus reflecting the fact thatremuneration, in particular, and employmentare developing positively again.
As things currently stand, for the year as a
whole the statutory health insurance schemeis expected to significantly outperform origin-al forecasts. There are indications that thehealth insurance institutions’ deficit is likely tobe lower owing to smaller increases in ex-penditure and, at the same time, that thehealth insurance fund will probably record aclear surplus owing to higher-than-antici-pated contribution receipts. A surplus for theentire system now seems by no means un-attainable. As a result, the funding gap is like-ly to be smaller in 2011. The current healthreform envisages putting the general contri-bution rate back up to 15.5%, yet not redu-cing the compensatory central governmentgrant
3, as well as reining in spending on
benefits. Hence, for the time being, it will not
be necessary to demand additional contribu-
tions, assuming the spending cuts envisaged
can actually be pushed through despite resist-ance from the many pressure groups.Finances of the statutory

2Central government grants to the statutory health in-
surance scheme will total 315.7 billion in 2010 (com-
pared with just over 37 billion in 2009). 35.5 billion of
this is in the form of the regular central government
grant, which, as planned, goes up by 31.5 billion each
year, 36.3 billion is being transferred to compensate for
the contribution shortfalls resulting from the lowering of
the general contribution rate from 15.5% to 14.9% in
mid-2009, which was implemented as an economic
stimulus measure, and the remaining 33.9 billion takes
the form of a special grant to offset cyclically induced rev-enue shortfalls, which is to be paid during 2010.
3Instead, the reform envisages further increasing the
regular central government grant to 37 billion and once
again issuing a one-off special grant of 32 billion, result-
ing overall in a planned decline of only 30.4 billion in
total central government grants.Health

12Public long-term care insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme
recorded a slight surplus in the second quar-
ter which was somewhat lower than one year
previously (+ 31/C254billion). At just under 21/C252%,
growth in revenue was much slower than
growth in expenditure (61/C252%). Employee
contributions (+21/C252%) and pensioner contri-
butions (+3% owing to the high pension in-
crease) rose a little more sharply, whereas the
strong growth in contributions for recipients
of unemployment benefits recorded during
the economic crisis has ground to a halt. All
in all, contribution receipts reflect the favour-
able development in employment and, above
all, remuneration owing, inter alia , to the
reduction of short-time working.The clear growth in expenditure is chiefly
attributable to out-patient non-financial
benefits and to financial benefits as these
rates received the sharpest upward adjust-
ment on 1 January 2010 as part of the long-
term care reform. By contrast, the benefits
for in-patient nursing care grew at a weaker
pace. However, on balance, the increase in
benefit rates accounts for only a small share
of the rise in expenditure.4The larger share is
attributable to a greater take-up of the range
of long-term care benefits, which was ex-
tended owing to the reform.
In mid-2010, liquid reserves amounted to just
under 35 billion, or roughly three months of
average expenditure. For the year as a whole,
the long-term care insurance scheme is likely
to record a surplus again as contributions in
the final quarter are usually higher owing to
bonuses. However, it is unlikely that the 31
billion surplus from 2009 will be reached.
Looking further ahead, the current contribu-
tion rate of 1.95% (plus 0.25% for the child-
less) will not generate sufficient revenue to
be able to cover the foreseeable marked rise
in expenditure. In addition to the growing
number of benefit recipients owing to demo-
graphic developments, the automatic adjust-
ment of benefit rates introduced with the
2008 reform ups the pressure on expend-
iture.Finances of the public long-

13Securities markets
Bond market
The issuance volume in the German bond
market was down markedly on the month in
July 2010, with gross sales amounting to
3105.3 billion compared with 3173.3 billion
in June. After deducting redemptions, which
also decreased, and taking account of
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds, the volume of outstanding domestic
bonds decreased by 333.6 billion. Foreign
debt securities with a total value of 33.6 bil-
lion were concurrently sold on the German
market; this consisted almost exclusively of
euro-denominated securities. On balance,
therefore, 330.0 billion was returned to in-
vestors.
Credit institutions reduced their capital mar-
ket borrowing in July by a further 331.2 bil-
lion (after 324.5 billion in June). The largest
repurchases, in net terms, concerned other
bank debt securities, which can be structured
particularly flexibly ( 314.5 billion), and public
Pfandbriefe ( 314.3 billion), although mort-
gage Pfandbriefe were also redeemed on
balance ( 33.8 billion). By contrast, debt secur-
ities issued by specialised credit institutions
were sold to the value of 31.4 billion.
The public sector redeemed debt securities
worth a total of 31.2 billion net in the report-
ing month. Securities totalling 32.3 billion net
were returned to central government. This
notably included ten-year federal bonds
(Bunds) in the amount of 314.5 billion and, to
a lesser extent, Federal Treasury financingpaper ( 31.3 billion). By contrast, central
government issued two-year Federal Treasury
notes (Sch/C228tze) worth 36.1 billion, five-year
Federal notes (Bobls) worth 35.1 billion, and,
to a lesser extent, 30-year Federal bonds
(32.4 billion). The outstanding amount of
debt securities issued by state governments
rose by 31.1 billion.
In July, German enterprises redeemed bonds
for31.2 billion net, on balance exclusively in
the form of bonds with original maturities of
more than one year.
On balance, debt securities were purchased
by all investor groups. Domestic credit institu-
tions in particular divested themselves of
323.9 billion worth of bonds, the majority of
which constituted domestic paper. Foreign
investors sold debt securities for 33.2 billion,
and only instruments issued by private bor-
rowers. Domestic non-banks disposed of
bonds for 32.9 billion net, all of which was
domestic paper.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter-
prises issued 30.3 billion worth of new shares
in the German equity market, the majority of
which involved listed companies. By contrast,
the outstanding amount of foreign shares in
the German market was down by 32.4 billion
in July. Domestic credit institutions were the
main buyers, yet also sold equities for 32.9
billion net. Overall, domestic non-banks ex-
changed domestic shares in their portfolios
for foreign ones ( 30.3 billion). Foreign invest-
ors acquired 30.8 billion net worth of equities.Sales of debt

14Investment fund shares
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of
36.8 billion net in July, the majority of which
was channelled into specialised funds re-
served for institutional investors ( 35.1 billion).
Of the domestic funds open to the public,
open-end real estate funds ( 30.6 billion),
bond-based funds ( 30.5 billion) and mixed
securities funds ( 30.4 billion) successfully off-
loaded their shares as well as, albeit to a less-
er extent, mixed funds and equity funds ( 30.2
billion each). By contrast, money market
funds had to redeem shares worth 30.1 bil-
lion. Foreign mutual investment funds record-
ed modest inflows from German investors in
the reporting month ( 30.8 billion). Mutual
fund shares were primarily acquired by
domestic non-banks in July ( 38.1 billion), aswell as by credit institutions to a lesser extent
(30.2 billion). By contrast, foreign investors
resold 30.7 billion net worth of fund shares.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 39.0 billion in
July 2010. The result was thus 33.7 billion
down on the level of the previous month.
This was attributable to a narrower trade
surplus and to an increased deficit on invisible
current transactions, which comprise services,
income and current transfers.
According to provisional figures released by
the Federal Statistical Office, in July the for-
eign trade surplus went down by 30.7 billion
on the month to 313.5 billion. However, after
adjustment for seasonal and calendar vari-
ations, it went up by 30.3 billion to 312.7 bil-
lion. The value of imports declined somewhat
more significantly (-2.2%) than that of ex-
ports (-1.5%). Compared with the second-
quarter average, seasonally adjusted nominal
exports rose by 3.3%, while the increase in
imports stood just slightly below this figure at
3.0%.
In July, the deficit in invisible current trans-
actions expanded from 30.7 billion to 33.3
billion. This can be attributed in part to a
deterioration in all three sub-accounts. The
deficit on services went up by 31.6 billion to
33.1 billion as a result of increased expend-
iture on travel. In addition, the deficit in
current transfers grew by 30.8 billion to 33.6
billion. By contrast, there was only a marginalSales and purchases

15month-on-month decline in the surplus in
cross-border income (from 33.5 billion to
33.4 billion in the reporting month).
With regard to cross-border portfolio invest-ment, net capital exports in July stood at 33.8
billion, which was far lower than in June(324.2 billion). The main reason for this was
that foreign portfolio investors reduced theirinvestments in Germany less vigorously thanbefore (by 33.1 billion, following a decrease
of318.1 billion in June). In doing so, they
mainly disposed of debt securities ( 33.2 bil-
lion). By contrast, there was a modestdemand for shares. Resident investors ac-quired foreign interest-bearing instrumentsand equities in the amount of 30.7 billion.
Purchases of debt securities ( 33.6 billion) and
of mutual fund shares ( 30.8 billion) were
widely offset by sales of shares ( 33.7 billion).
With respect to direct investment, the Julysub-account was close to balance. On theone hand, German enterprises withdrewsmall amounts of funds from their foreignaffiliates ( 31.3 billion). They did this mainly by
means of intra-group credit transactions(37.1 billion), while providing their foreign
branches and subsidiaries with funds viaadditional equity capital ( 33.2 billion) and
reinvested earnings ( 32.6 billion). At the
same time, foreign companies likewise
reduced the capitalisation of their Germanaffiliates, which was again primarily attribut-able to intra-group credit transactions.

net capital inflows of 319.1 billion in July.
Non-banks accounted for 31.5 billion of this
sum. General government raised funds
abroad ( 37.0 billion), chiefly in the form of
short-term financial loans. By contrast, trans-
actions by enterprises and households led to
an outflow of funds worth 35.5 billion. In
particular, they bolstered their bank deposits
and short-term receivables abroad. In the
banking system, foreign funds worth 317.6
billion were generated. This was largely due
to the high capital inflows experienced by
credit institutions ( 339.0 billion), which, inparticular, reduced their long-term receivables
resulting from financial loans granted to their
foreign counterparties. Moreover, they saw
inflows of funds from abroad arising from
extended liability positions. Conversely, the
Bundesbank recorded capital outflows ( 321.4
billion), the vast majority of which resulted
from the increase in claims within the

17The performance of German credit institutions
in 2009
The performance of German credit institutions in the financial year 2009 was characterised main-
ly by two opposing factors: the rapid recovery in the financial markets that began worldwide in
the second quarter of the year and the severe global recession. Overall, a loss for the year before
tax of 32.9 billion was shown, although this was 322.1 billion below the extremely large loss in
2008. It is especially notable, however, that this aggregate shortfall was due to losses recorded
by a comparatively small number of larger institutions, which were not offset by the profits of
the vast majority of the other institutions.
Owing to individual institutions, the big banks, Landesbanken and mortgage banks still recorded
large losses for the year before tax, although these were sometimes significantly reduced from
the previous year. With the exception of the regional banks, which suffered an almost complete
reduction of their profit for the year before tax, all the other categories of banks were able to
show sometimes markedly higher pre-tax profits for the year.
The improvement in the profit and loss account – based on the published individual accounts
drawn up in accordance with the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch ) – was support-
ed mainly by large profits in own-account trading as well as a marked reduction in net valuation
charges, which is likely to have been due to significantly lower risk provisioning for securities of
the liquidity reserve. Despite this decline, the markedly lower net valuation charges in compari-
son with the previous year were still at a high level from a historical perspective. The rise in risk
provisioning in lending business due to the recession probably played a key role in this respect.
Profitability was also dented by a rise in administrative spending and a perceptible increase in
losses in the “extraordinary account”. Although, on balance, German banks generated substan-
tial income from the release of reserves, for the second year in succession there was still a signifi-
cant balance sheet loss ( 35.1 billion), although this was concentrated on a few categories of
banks and on a small number of banks within those categories.
Despite the current favourable underlying macroeconomic conditions, a rather subdued develop-
ment in profitability may be assumed for the financial year 2010 so far. It is therefore likely that,
owing to the lagged effects of last year’s worldwide recession, performance is still being shaped
by considerable risk provisioning in lending business. Furthermore, there is still heightened uncer-
tainty in the financial markets and this may markedly restrict the earnings potential, especially in
operational business.

18Income from interest business
Mainly on account of the lower general inter-
est rate level, there was a massive reduction
in German credit institutions’ interest ex-
penses and income in the reporting year.
Interest expenses declined more sharply than
interest income, resulting in net interest re-
ceived – ie the difference between interest
income and expenses – rising slightly by 30.9
billion to 391.5 billion.
Nevertheless, the share of net interest income
in operating income1fell by 12.1 percentage
points to 72.5% – which is near to the aver-
age since 1993 – since a large profit was
achieved in own-account trading again fol-
lowing the sharp drop in 2008. The interest
margin – calculated as net interest received inrelation to the average balance sheet total –
increased slightly from 1.09% in 2008 to
1.14% in 2009. In consolidated terms – ie
after adjustment for interbank business,
which has no effect on net interest received –
the interest margin went up again for the first
time in five years to 1.61%.
The picture across the various categories of
banks was fairly mixed in the reporting year.
Savings banks and credit cooperatives, in par-
ticular, were able to achieve significant
growth again. Savings banks’ net interest re-
ceived, for example, grew noticeably by 31.7
billion to 322.6 billion, mainly owing to large
profits resulting from maturity transform-
ation. This increased the share of net interest
received in their operating income by 2.6 per-
centage points to 78.6%. Credit cooperatives
recorded even stronger growth in their net
interest income; their net interest received in-
creased by 31.9 billion to 315.1 billion in the
reporting year, which was well above the
longer-term average in the period from 1993
to 2008 ( 313.3 billion). As a result, there was
a clear increase in its share in operating busi-
ness from 69% to 76.9%. As in the case of
savings banks, too, credit cooperatives’ inter-
est margin increased for the first time in five
years. Perceptible, albeit smaller growth in
net interest received was likewise achieved by
special purpose banks and mortgage banks.
By contrast, nearly all other categories of
banks showed a decline in their net interest
received. By far the largest absolute reduc-The performance of

19tion, amounting to 32.2 billion, was recorded
by the regional banks, however. The reasonfor this was an extreme decline in current in-come of almost 73% due mainly to the re-duction in income from shares, which alsocount as interest income, and from othervariable-yield securities. This lowered theshare of net interest received in their operat-ing income by a total of 6.6 percentagepoints to 62.3%. In comparison, at 30.8 bil-
lion, the fall in big banks’ net interest incomewas minor. The share of net interest receivedin total operating income, which has traditi-onally been comparatively small in the case ofbig banks, fell noticeably owing to a markedimprovement in the own-account tradingfigures and almost matched the longer-termaverage of the period from 1993 to 2008(64.6%). In relation to the volume of busi-ness, however, the big banks’ interest margin
showed a marked increase. There was a slightdeterioration in net interest received in thecase of Landesbanken and the regional insti-tutions of credit cooperatives, too. This wasdue mainly to higher costs of own funds andinterest rate developments in the capital andmoney markets (in conjunction with the re-duction of interest-dependent portfolios). Inthe case of Landesbanken, special factorsstemming from participating interests had anadditional reducing impact.

2Nevertheless, the reduction in net interest received in
the case of Landesbanken was also partly offset by the
non-servicing of participation rights capital and hybrid
capital by some institutions. This special factor was due
to the fulfilment of European Commission requirements
in the context of EU state aid control procedures due to
the stabilisation measures taken by the owners of the
Landesbanken concerned and by the Financial Market
Stabilisation Fund ( Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisie-
rung, SoFFin).

20est margin of Landesbanken remained con-
stant, it declined markedly in the case of
regional institutions of credit cooperatives.
Net commission income
Following the fairly poor results of the previous
year, the German banks recorded a further
decline in net commission income in the finan-
cial year 2009. Owing to a decline in commis-
sions received and an increase in commissions
paid, net commissions received fell by 32.4 bil-
lion to 327.4 billion. The importance of net
commissions received for operational business
– measured as the percentage share of this
item in total operating income – was not as
great as in the previous year. Nevertheless, at
21.7%, it was just above the longer-term
average of the period from 1993 to 2008.
Thus, despite the reduction, it represented a
major source of German credit institutions’
income during the reporting period, too.
The less favourable result for net commissions
received was due mainly to subdued stock
market activity, which hardly picked up des-
pite the fact that stock prices began to go up
again from the second quarter of 2009. The
volume of sales on the German equity mar-
kets in 2009, at 32.9 trillion, was almost 48%
down on the year. At the same time, how-
ever, bank customers’ interest in mutual fund
shares picked up again in 2009, which, taken
in isolation, buoyed up commission business.
It was solely the acquisition of mutual fund
shares by domestic non-banks which in-
creased during this period by 332.2 billion to
358.0 billion.In the reporting year, the decline in net com-
mission received affected nearly all categories
of banks, albeit to varying degrees. In particu-
lar, commercial banks, which generated al-
most 55% of net commissions received by
domestic credit institutions, saw a marked fall
in their income from commission business, al-
though regional banks accounted for the ma-
jority of this. The big banks – for which com-
mission business has traditionally played a
major role in operational business – and Lan-
desbanken also saw a marked decline in their
net commissions received, however.3
By contrast, as in the previous reporting year,
savings banks and credit cooperatives record-
ed a comparatively minor decline in their net
commissions received. At 20% of their total
operating result, this income item is much
less important for these institutions than it is,
say, for the commercial banks. For savings
banks and credit cooperatives, the result for
net commissions received is, moreover, sig-
nificantly less dependent on developments in
the stock market – which, over time, is re-
flected in this income item being less volatile
for these categories of banks.
Net profit or net loss on financial
operations
Following the dramatic loss of 318.7 billion in
2008 due to the financial crisis, German
credit institutions recorded a large profit

banken was a marked rise in commissions paid for guar-

4The only year
since 1993 in which German banks achievedbetter own-account trading figures was2005.
This positive development was due mainly to
the marked reduction in risks on the moneyand capital markets, especially since thesecond quarter of 2009, which was, in turn, aresult of the massive support measures forthe financial sector taken by governmentsworldwide, economic stimulus packages andan expansionary monetary policy. Specifically,according to the published annual reports, itwas principally foreign exchange and moneymarket trading as well as business in interestrate products that made clearly positive con-
tributions to income. Owing to further nega-tive valuation adjustments, trading in creditproducts (including structured products) is,however, likely to have depressed the own-account trading figures, albeit to a far lesserextent than in the previous year.
The profits were most pronounced in those
categories of banks which had suffered thegreatest losses in the previous year as a resultof the financial crisis. This applies particularlyto the big banks, which accounted for theRelative significance of major income and cost items for individual categories of

24majority of profits in own-account trading.
According to the published annual reports,
there were, however, very mixed develop-
ments within this category of banks.5The
Landesbanken and regional institutions of
credit cooperatives also improved their own-
account trading figures, but to a far lesser ex-
tent than the big banks. In this respect, too,
the published annual reports show some
marked differences within these categories.
In the case of Landesbanken, what should
also be taken into consideration is that the re-
quirements to reduce the balance sheet
which the European Commission imposed on
some institutions in the context of EU state
aid control procedures – including a reduction
of or complete withdrawal from own-account
trading – are likely to have had a dampening
impact on the own-account trading figures of
this category of banks.6

Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (guarantee and risk

more, a resolution agency under German federal law
(“bad bank”) was already set up for one institution for
the purpose of unloading risky financial assets which

control procedures by the European Commission formed
the basis for granting this financial assistance. These

25the highest figure so far. This was due primar-
ily to the 7.0% rise in staff costs. Given that
there was a further slight decline in the num-
ber of persons employed in the banking in-
dustry (646,650, compared with 657,850 in
2008), the rise is likely to have been due
mainly to the increase in variable and
performance-related salary components. By
contrast, other administrative spending,
which essentially comprises operating ex-
penditure, expenditure on third-party ser-
vices, as well as write-offs and write-downs
of tangible fixed assets, went up only slightly.
Here, too, there were heterogeneous devel-
opments across the various categories of
banks. For example, the increase in adminis-
trative spending was, as might be expected,
especially pronounced in the case of bigbanks. More than two-thirds of this increase
was due to higher staff costs and the rest was
caused by a rise in other administrative
spending. The increase in general administra-
tive spending was not quite as marked in the
case of credit cooperatives and savings
banks, for which the share of administrative
spending in the business volume plays a more
significant role than for commercial banks. As
part of their restructuring programmes, the
Landesbanken considerably reduced their
total administrative spending.

26porting year and was therefore below the
longer-term average of the period from 1993
to 2008 ( 32.8 billion). This fall was due mainly
to the sharp rise in other operating charges
accompanied by a perceptible decline in
income.
Big banks, in particular, were unable to match
their positive result of the previous year and,
owing to a marked decline in other operating
income along with a considerable rise in
other operating charges, recorded a negative
balance.7The sharp decline experienced by
credit cooperatives, on the other hand, was
due mainly to a special factor in the previous
year now being absent.8For all other cat-
egories of banks, there were scarcely any
changes compared with the previous year.Operating result before the valuation
of assets
In the financial year 2009, the German bank-
ing industry recorded significant growth of
315.6 billion to 344.1 billion in its operating
result before the valuation of assets. This in-
crease was due mainly to a sharp improve-
ment in the own-account trading figures. This
more than offset the rise in administrative

27Owing to the sharp rise in their own-account
trading figures, the improvement in the oper-
ating result before the valuation of assets was
especially marked in the case of the big
banks. The Landesbanken and regional insti-
tutions of credit cooperatives also benefited
crucially from improved own-account trading
figures and were thus able to show a notable
increase in their operating result before the
valuation of assets in some cases, although
the rise was far smaller than that shown by
the big banks. In nearly all other categories of
banks, growth was due to significantly im-
proved net interest income, even though a
number of opposing effects meant that the
increase in the operating result before the
valuation of assets was not as large for the
credit cooperatives and mortgage banks. The
regional banks were the sole category of
banks to show a marked decline in their oper-
ating result before the valuation of assets.
Net income or net charges from the
valuation of assets, and operating result
Following a massive rise in 2007 and 2008 as
a result of the financial crisis, German credit
institutions’ net charges from the valuation of
securities of the liquidity reserve, claims and
loans showed a marked fall of 39.6 billion to
327.0 billion.10Nevertheless, risk provisioning
remained at a high level compared with the
period from 1993 to 2008.11Besides the
write-downs and transfers to provisions re-
corded under net income or net charges from
the valuation of assets, net resources of 32.1
billion were allocated to the fund for general
banking risks (pursuant to section 340 (g) ofthe German Commercial Code) in the report-
ing year. These resources do not, however, re-
duce the profit for the year in the perform-
ance analysis presented here, but are allo-
cated to the appropriation of profit as part of
the accumulation of reserves.
Looking at the various categories of banks, all
of them – with the exception of regional
banks and branches of foreign banks, whose
risk provisioning remained virtually un-
changed – recorded a reduction in their net
valuation charges, although the aggregate
decline was due, in particular, to big banks,
Landesbanken, credit cooperatives and spe-
cial purpose banks. Despite the sometimes
marked decline in risk provisioning, net valu-
ation charges in the reporting year were still
well above the longer-term averages of the
period from 1993 to 2008 for all categories
of banks except savings banks, credit co-
operatives and regional institutions of credit
cooperatives.12Some very mixed develop-
ments within the individual categories were
behind these movements, too.13
According to the published annual reports,
the change in risk provisioning in the report-
10Within this item, the respective institutions had al-
ready made use of the cross-offsetting option permissible
under section 340 (f) (3) of the German Commercial
Code.
11During the period from 1993 to 2008, average net
valuation charges stood at 317.6 billion. In relation to this
figure, risk provisioning in the reporting year was 53.1%
above the longer-term average.
12Looking at risk provisioning in relation to the balance
sheet total, a similar picture emerges in terms of the devi-
ations in the results for the individual categories of banks
in the reporting year from the longer-term averages.
13According to the data published in the annual reports,
risk provisioning by Landesbanken, mortgage banks, spe-
cial purpose banks and regional banks, in particular, was

28ing year is likely to have been shaped, above
all, by two opposing factors: the global recov-
ery in the financial markets and the lagged
real economic impact of the financial crisis.
Risk provisioning in the reporting year
appears to have been affected positively
– through a reduction in charges – by the result
for securities of the liquidity reserve, mainly
on account of the recovery in the financial
markets that set in especially from the second
quarter of 2009. According to the data pub-
lished in the annual reports, credit institutions
recorded positive returns owing to write-ups
of securities (including some structured prod-
ucts) whose value had been written down in
the previous year as well as capital gains.
Probably of even greater significance in this
context were the much lower write-downs
(-76.5% compared with 2008) on debt secur-ities in domestic credit institutions’ portfolios,
some of which were recorded under net
charges from the valuation of assets. In rela-
tion to the period from 2000 to 2008, write-
downs on debt securities were thus 26.4%
below their medium-term average and
showed a decline for the first time since
2005.14
Nevertheless, according to the published an-
nual reports, these charge-reducing effects
are likely to have been countered by a
marked increase in risk provisioning in lend-
ing business owing to the global recession15
and by the resulting deterioration in borrower
creditworthiness. Developments in domestic
lending show that, despite a comparatively
small 5.0% rise16in the number of insolven-
cies, the massive increase in the volume of as-
sociated problem loans (from 333.5 billion in
2008 to 385.0 billion in 2009) is very likely to
have resulted in significantly higher losses, es-
pecially in corporate lending business. Doubt-
ful debt arising from business insolvencies,
for example, showed a massive 231.4% rise
to373.1 billion, whereas that of other debt-
ors and consumers went up only slightly by
4.2% and 2.4% to 311.9 billion and 35.8 bil-
lion respectively. In relation to the period
since 1993, problem loans as a whole
reached their absolute peak and were 356.1Risk provisioning

14Between 2005 and 2008, write-downs on debt secur-
ities rose annually by an average of roughly 96%, al-
though the financial crisis is likely to have played a key
role in this context.
15In 2009, real GDP contracted by 4.7% in Germany, by

29billion above the longer-term average be-
tween 1993 and 2008 ( 328.9 billion).17In-
solvencies in the reporting year were crucially
influenced by numerous major insolvencies in
the trade, tourism, clothing and textiles sec-
tors, as well as in the automotive industry (es-
pecially suppliers of components), shipbuild-
ing and the semiconductor segment.
According to the data in the published annual
reports, some strains are likely to have arisen
in international lending business owing to the
difficult situation on the commercial real es-
tate and housing markets in a number of
euro-area and non-euro-area countries, main-
ly as a result of the drop in the value of collat-
eral due to property price deflation and the
growing number of credit defaults.
Owing to the substantial 39.6 billion decline
in net valuation charges, the improvement in
the operating result after valuation in 2009,
with growth of 325.2 billion to 317.1 billion
– following a negative figure for the previous
year of 38.2 billion – was much sharper than
the increase in the operating result before the
valuation of assets. Despite this significant
improvement, it was still below its longer-
term average between 1993 and 2008
(319.5 billion), which was due mainly to the
above-average risk provisioning.
Looking at the individual categories of banks,
apart from regional banks – which recorded a
poorer operating result – all the other cat-
egories of banks showed sometimes marked
improvements in their operating results. Not-
withstanding this improvement, the operat-
ing results of big banks, Landesbanken, mort-gage banks and regional banks in the report-
ing year were largely at levels well below
their multi-year averages, ie in relation to the
period from 1993 to 2008. In contrast to this,
the operating results of the credit coopera-
tives and their regional institutions as well as
of special purpose banks were noticeably
above their longer-term averages. Savings
banks were only slightly above their longer-
term average, however.
Other and extraordinary income
or charges
The “extraordinary account” placed an ex-
ceptionally heavy strain on performance in
2008, resulting in a balance of - 316.9 billion
– above all, owing to massive losses in finan-
cial investment business due to the financial
crisis. This was followed in 2009 by a further
deterioration in the annual result with Ger-
man banks recording a balance of - 319.9 bil-
lion. Although net charges in financial invest-
ment business were reduced by 35.0 billion in
comparison with the previous year, the sig-
nificant 37.0 billion deterioration in net extra-
ordinary income and charges in the narrower
definition18as well as the 31.3 billion increase
in net loss transfers had a marked negative
impact on the “extraordinary account”.

30Charges incurred through derived profits fell
only slightly, however.
The further deterioration in the “extraordin-
ary account” in 2009 was due to markedly
higher losses in the case of big banks, Landes-
banken and – to a much lesser extent – at
credit cooperatives and regional institutions
of credit cooperatives. In the case of big
banks, this was essentially due to an increase
in losses in the extraordinary profit and loss in
the narrower definition, although this was
accompanied by a partially offsetting decline
in losses in financial investment business. At
Landesbanken, the deterioration in the
“extraordinary account” was driven mainly
by higher extraordinary net charges in the
narrower definition, higher net loss transfers
as well as higher net charges in financialinvestment business. The increase in net
charges in the “extraordinary account” at
credit cooperatives and regional institutions
of credit cooperatives resulted to a large
extent from higher net charges in financial
investment business.19

19According to the data published in the annual reports,
the losses in all the cited categories of banks were essen-
tially due to individual institutions within the respective
category. The losses at big banks in the reporting year
were primarily concentrated on one institution which re-
corded, inter alia , a high loss transfer at a subsidiary as
well as a high extraordinary loss in the narrower defin-
ition owing to the takeover of another big bank. In the
case of Landesbanken, the losses were essentially con-
centrated on two institutions and were due mainly to loss
transfers in the case of subsidiaries or the hiving-off of
subsidiaries, write-downs in financial investment business
as well as the formation of restructuring provisions in
connection with EU state aid control procedures.... particularly

31provements in the – nevertheless still negative
– balances of the special purpose banks, sav-
ings banks and mortgage banks. This devel-
opment was due, in particular, to a significant
reduction in losses in financial investment
business, which had been placing the “extra-
ordinary account” under considerable strain
in the previous year owing to the financial
crisis.

Despite the marked improvement in the oper-
ating result, the further massive losses due to
the “extraordinary account” meant that Ger-
man credit institutions again posted a loss forthe financial year before tax in 2009. At 32.9
billion, however, this was significantly lower
than the loss of 325.0 billion in 2008. In the
reporting year, marked improvements in the
annual results and in profits for the year be-
fore tax were posted by special purpose
banks ( 31.5 billion compared with - 33.4 bil-
lion), savings banks ( 34.7 billion compared
with 32.2 billion), credit cooperatives ( 33.4
billion compared with 32.0 billion), and re-
gional institutions of credit cooperatives ( 30.7
billion compared with 30.4 billion). Despite a
clear improvement, big banks again showed
a loss for the financial year before tax
amounting to 36.7 billion, although the data
published in the annual reports reveal that
this was essentially due to a single institution.

32losses for the financial year before tax of 35.2
billion and 31.4 billion respectively. Here, too,
the published annual reports show that the
pre-tax losses were due principally to individ-
ual institutions. Regional banks were the only
category to suffer a marked reduction (of
31.3 billion to 32.0 million) in their result for
the financial year before tax. This was due,
above all, to a decline in net income in oper-
ational business.
Although there was an improvement in the
annual results across all categories of banks
with the exception of the regional banks, the
reduction in the negative aggregate return on
assets before tax from -0.30% in 2008 to
-0.04% in 2009 was accompanied by very
heterogeneous developments among the in-
dividual institutions. Grouping the individualbanks by profitability classes and looking at
the relative size of each category – measured
by their percentage share in the balance
sheet total of all German banks – shows that
there was an improvement on 2008 in all
profitability classes with the exception of the
bottom class.20Nevertheless, it also becomes
clear that, in the reporting year, losses were
generated by a small number of banks (3.5%
of all institutions) which, however, accounted
for just under one-third of the aggregate bal-
ance sheet total. These losses were not entire-
ly offset by the profits of the majority of
banks (96.5% of all institutions), whose share
of the aggregate balance sheet total stood at
just over two-thirds. Overall, therefore, the
losses of a comparatively small number of
fairly large institutions were more significant
than the profits of the vast majority of the
other institutions.
In line with the development in the return on
assets, the return on equity before tax was –
despite a perceptible improvement of 6.86
percentage points – still negative for German
banks as a whole (-0.84%). However, all cat-
egories of banks with the exception of re-
gional banks recorded an improvement – in
some cases, a marked one – even though the
return on equity before tax was still clearly
negative for the big banks, Landesbanken
and mortgage banks.Credit institutions’ profit for

33Taxes on income and earnings increased by
32.6 billion to 33.9 billion in 2009, although,
among those categories of banks with an ag-gregate profit for the financial year, signifi-cant tax expenses were recorded only by sav-ings banks, credit cooperatives and – albeit toa lesser extent – regional banks. Big banks, bycontrast, were the only category of bankswith considerable tax receipts; the publishedannual reports show that this was due to twoinstitutions. For German banks, this resultedin an aggregate loss for the financial year of36.8 billion, which was due, in particular, to
big banks, Landesbanken, mortgage banksand regional banks.
To a much greater extent than in the previous
year, net losses brought forward of 38.6 bil-
lion (compared with 32.3 billion in 2008) hada negative effect on the financial result. As in
2008, these were concentrated solely onmortgage banks, special purpose banks andregional banks.
21In contrast to the previous
year, financial resources were again allocatedto the fund for general banking risks – to thevalue of 32.1 billion net. These consisted of
gross transfers in the amount of 32.8 billion
as well as income from withdrawals of 30.7
billion. According to the published annual re-ports, the latter were due solely to one insti-tution within the “big banks” category.

34in the amount of 312.4 billion. These consist-
ed of gross withdrawals of 314.5 billion –
which, according to the data published in the
annual reports, were due largely to individual
institutions among the big banks and Landes-
banken – as well as transfers to reserves and
participation rights capital in the amount of
32.1 billion. Net withdrawals from reserves
and participation rights capital were 38.2 bil-
lion lower than in 2008, however. Overall,
there remained a balance sheet loss for the
second year in succession; at 35.1 billion, the
loss was 30.3 billion higher than in 2008. This
was the outcome of balance sheet losses at
Landesbanken, mortgage banks, special pur-
pose banks and regional banks, although the
losses in each category were concentrated on
a small number of institutions. All the other
categories of banks showed an aggregate
balance sheet profit in 2009.
Outlook
Owing to the favourable financial market set-
ting and positive global real economic
growth, the first quarter of the current finan-
cial year 2010 initially saw a marked improve-
ment in the performance of large German
internationally active banks, for which intra-
year profitability ratios are already available at
group level and on an IFRS basis. Following a
loss in 2009, the big German banks were
thus able to show a strong aggregate profit
again in the first quarter of 2010 owing to a
marked rise in income from own-account
trading, the absence of losses in financial in-
vestment business, increased earnings fromcommission business, and a perceptible re-
duction in risk provisioning.22
Such positive growth was not maintained in
the second quarter, however. In this respect,
tensions in the financial markets stemming
from the escalation of the debt crisis in some
euro-area countries seem to have left their
mark on the balance sheets. This mainly af-
fected the results in own-account trading;
these exerted a considerable dampening im-
pact on the performance of the large German
institutions.
Even though the profitability of the big Ger-
man banking groups in the first half of the
current year does not allow any reliable con-
clusions to be drawn about the performance
of the German banking system as a whole in
2010,23the intra-year group accounts do pro-
vide major clues as to the possible determin-
ants of the German banking industry’s future
performance. First, the positive development
in the real economy in Germany – which is
likely to move on to a more moderate path of
growth following an extremely dynamic first
half of the year – will probably continue to
have a positive impact on domestic non-
banks’ credit quality. Nevertheless, it may be
assumed that risk provisioning in domestic
lending business – which typically lags behind
developments in the real economy to a cer-
22The aggregate results nevertheless conceal very mixed
developments across the individual institutions in some
cases.
23The sample of the large German internationally active
banks should not be regarded as representative of the
German banking system as a whole, particularly as they
differ significantly from many other institutions – espe-
cially those in retail business – in terms of their business
models, portfolio compositions, financial structures, and
accounting standards.Marked

35tain extent – will still be shaped by the effects
of the 2009 recession.24Furthermore, risks
still exist, especially in international lendingbusiness, as a result of deteriorations increditworthiness. This applies principally tocommercial real estate loans owing to pricefalls in some overheated property markets in-side and outside the euro area. On the otherhand, given the robust activity in the worldeconomy and despite existing uncertainties insome countries, there appears to have been amarked reduction in the risk, in particular, ofthe industrial countries sliding into a further(double-dip) recession and an associated po-tential increase in risk provisioning.
These reduced real economic risks are, how-
ever, still accompanied by financial marketrisks that are likely to limit future earnings po-tentials. The currently available data, for ex-ample, indicate that the earnings opportun-ities with regard to securities and other finan-cial instruments held in the institutions’ port-folios are likely to have become more restrict-ed owing to the continuing heightened un-certainties in the financial markets. Further-more, the still ongoing real estate price cor-rections in some countries could also lead tofurther losses from write-downs, especiallyon commercial mortgage-backed securities(CMBS).
25
Interest rate business, which has benefited re-cently mainly from low wholesale fundingcosts, a steep yield curve and low centralbank interest rates, is also likely to generate amore limited earnings potential for the finan-cial year 2010. For one thing, it is to be ex-pected that improvements in earnings by ex-panding the volume of business and, in par-
ticular, the volume of credit will be possibleonly to a limited extent if demand for bankloans remains weak. For another, the poten-tial for expanding the balance sheet in theGerman banking sector also appears limitedat present, especially on account of balancesheet restructuring processes and in view ofthe higher capital ratios and improved qualityof banks’ capital called for in the wake of thefinancial crisis, which will also be a regulatoryrequirement in the future. Furthermore, thesteep yield curve since the beginning of 2009and the resulting incentives for greater ma-turity transformation mean that there arehigher interest rate risks from a possible flat-tening of the term structure. Moreover, cost-side risks also exist owing to a possible in-crease in wholesale funding costs. In this re-spect, a possible detrimental impact couldstem from competition for deposits, possiblecrowding-out effects due to some countries’future large-scale funding needs in the capitalmarket, higher risk premiums for some gov-ernment bonds feeding through to bank debtsecurities, or a preference for longer-termcapital market financing in the event of a flat-ter yield curve. In addition, an exit from pro-viding government guarantees for medium to
24The volume of problem assets associated with insolv-
encies fell by 13.2% overall in Germany in the first half of
2010 compared with the same period of 2009. This was
due to a marked decline in problem loans in the case of
business insolvencies. This was, however, accompanied
by a 7.2% rise in the number of insolvencies in Germany
during the same period (including business insolvencies
+2.0%, consumer insolvencies +11.6%). See Statis-
tisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office), Unterneh-
men und Arbeitsst/C228tten, Insolvenzverfahren, Fachserie 2,
Reihe 4.1, June 2010 (available in German only).
25Moreover, there would be the risk of rating migration
effects, which, owing to external ratings downgrades,
would lead to an increase in the risk-weighted assets
and, therefore, to higher regulatory capital requirements.Earnings

36long-term bank debt securities – leading to
higher wholesale funding costs – could have
the effect of reducing net interest received.
Commission business is likely to benefit from
the expected large issuance volume in the
capital market. Renewed tensions would
dampen capital market activity, however.
Cost-side relief in the form of lower staff
costs is not to be expected, particularly in
view of the job cuts that were already put
into effect in 2009.
In summary, given the current macroecon-
omic developments in the financial year 2010,
it may therefore be assumed at present that
profitability will tend to be subdued and that
downside risks will dominate. With regard to
the associated implications for German
banks’ capital adequacy, the latest EU-wide
stress test26has nevertheless shown that the
German banking system is in robust shape,
not least owing to past balance sheet adjust-
ments and injections of capital, and that itcan therefore offset the negative impact of
additional downside risks, too.
Against the backdrop of the stricter minimum
capital standards for banks27that were
adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision in September 2010 and the
planned introduction of a bank levy in Ger-
many, the earnings outlook for German credit
institutions may be less positive than in the
period prior to the financial crisis (for details
of the decisions of the Basel Committee, see
page 8-9). Ultimately, however, both German
banks and all other sectors will benefit from
the improved financial stability.

was decided. See Basel Committee on Banking Super-

49The Act Modernising Accounting Law from a
banking supervision perspective
The latest financial crisis, which is not over yet, has made clear that corporate information avail-
able to bank supervisors and the market is crucial to preventing crises. Against this background,
balance sheet reporting by banks not only provides supervisors with an important source of infor-
mation and a basis for analysis, but is also the starting point in measuring regulatory capital and
prudential capital requirements. Appropriate accounting rules are key in this context. For this
reason, the Deutsche Bundesbank was closely involved from the outset in modernising account-
ing practices that are based on the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB)
through the Act Modernising Accounting Law ( Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz ).
The aim of the Act Modernising Accounting Law was to modify HGB accounting rules by moder-
ately harmonising them with international accounting rules, the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). On the
one hand, rules were relaxed for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular. On the
other, while maintaining the principle of prudence in accounting practice, internationally orient-
ed accounting and valuation practices that were already being applied are now anchored in law.
However, harmonisation hit its limits in connection with preventing unwanted fluctuations in the
statement of income. This may be seen in the fair value accounting of the trading portfolio,
which is now permitted for credit institutions, under which valuation gains cannot be fully recog-
nised as income. This is achieved by applying a supervisory haircut to the fair value, as well as by
setting up a compulsory (and countercyclical) risk reserve. By modifying fair value accounting in
this way, the timeliness of the information in the financial statements is improved without the
need – in contrast to the IFRS – to dispense with the proven HGB principle of prudence.
The changes to the German Commercial Code as a result of the Act Modernising Accounting
Law have led to a modern German accounting legislation that can be actively advocated at an
international level, too, as an alternative to the IFRS. In addition, it offers an appropriate basis for
a risk-oriented banking supervision of all credit institutions.

50Objective of the Act Modernising
Accounting Law
Following the publication of the Act Modern-
ising Accounting Law on 28 May 2009, the
first financial statements to be prepared com-
pletely in accordance with new accounting
law will be presented as at 31 December
2010. The Act Modernising Accounting Law
marks the end of years of debate on the
development of German accounting law.
The keywords that might sum up the Act
Modernising Accounting Law are internation-
alisation, harmonisation, deregulation, and
preservation of the principle of prudence.
With regard to internationalisation, German
legislators sought to align HGB accounting
rules with international accounting standards
in order to make the HGB rules an inter-
nationally recognised and cost-efficient alter-
native accounting procedure for enterprises
which do not report directly under the IFRS.
In addition, several accounting methods were
codified in the German Commercial Code
which had already been commonly used by
some reporting entities based on an interpret-
ation of the Generally Accepted German
Accounting Principles ( Grunds/C228tze ordnungs-
m/C228ßiger Buchf/C252hrung – GoB). Moreover, a
number of European harmonisation provi-
sions were implemented.
Another declared objective of German legis-
lators was to scale back accounting require-
ments in order to simplify accounting proced-
ures for SMEs in particular.Despite the aims of internationalisation and
deregulation, however, the proven principles
of German accounting law such as the prin-
ciple of prudence, the purpose of which is
creditor protection, were to be upheld. In
future, too, the HGB annual accounts will
serve as the basis for setting the level of divi-
dend payments and for taxation purposes.
This article looks in more detail at selected
new rules that are especially relevant to the
banking industry, the regulatory framework
and bank supervisory practices.
Credit institutions’ accounting of financial
instruments assigned to the trading
portfolio (section 340e (3) of the German
Commercial Code)
In future, credit institutions’ trading portfolios
will be valued at fair value. In this important
segment for the banking industry, the amort-
ised cost principle has been formally revoked.
For some time now, a number of big banks
have interpreted the GoB such that the finan-
cial instruments assigned to their trading
portfolios are stated at fair value. However,
under the Act Modernising Accounting Law,
the market price is not simply taken as the
fair value. Instead, the Act provides for a
double safeguard to uphold the principle of
prudence by requiring a haircut and a block
on dividend payments.

51counting in financial statements, under the
Act Modernising Accounting Law, fair valueaccounting was introduced for credit andfinancial services institutions only; this is con-trary to the original intention of the govern-ment bill. It was felt that no such rule wasneeded for companies of the real economy.
For credit and financial services institutions,
the new subsection 3 of section 340e of theGerman Commercial Code stipulates thatfinancial instruments assigned to the tradingportfolio are to be valued at fair value minusa risk haircut. No definition of financial instru-ments is given, however, in light of the varietyand continuous innovation in this area. Nor isan individual definition of the trading port-folio offered; instead, the explanatory memo-randum to the act refers to the trading port-folio definition set forth in the German Bank-ing Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ). As a result, all
derivatives acquired for trading purposesmust also be reported at their positive ornegative fair values in the trading portfolio.The trading book is more broadly defined inthe German Banking Act and contains, inparticular, holdings of commodities. Under theGerman Commercial Code, financial instru-ments assigned to the trading portfolio areultimately those that credit and financial ser-vices institutions include neither in the liquid-ity reserve or current assets on the one hand,nor in fixed assets on the other. For banks,this gives rise to a further asset category inaddition to current assets and fixed assets.
In particular, supervisors welcome the stipu-
lated balance sheet reporting and fair valueaccounting of derivatives in the trading port-folio. Thus, this category of financial instru-
ments – which is of substantial importance tobanks’ risk situation – is now properly reflect-ed in the balance sheet.
However, the recognition of fair value gains
as income in the HGB profit and loss accountraises the supervisory issue of the recognitionof these unrealised gains and losses in regula-tory capital. Where the regulatory measure-ment of capital is based on financial state-ments drawn up according to the IFRS, suchunrealised trading gains are recognised underthe Basel recommendations
1and European
guidelines.2The same applies under the Ger-
man Transitional Regulation Governing Con-solidated Financial Statements ( Konzernab-
schluss/C252berleitungsverordnung ),
3which does
not stipulate a prudential correction for tradinggains. The reason given for accepting unreal-ised trading gains as tier 1 capital is that theholdings are constantly changing hands andshort-term gains are constantly being realisedin the trading book. Moreover, legislators havetaken into account the risks associated withabandoning the realisation principle by requir-ing a haircut on the fair values.Limited to

52The special valuation rules for the trading
portfolio have been taken into account in
that the balance sheet form in accordance
with the Credit Institution Accounting Regu-
lation4now contains separate balance sheet
items (asset item 6a and liability item 3a)5for
the trading portfolio, showing the gross
value. In order to report income and expend-
iture from the trading portfolio, the former
net income/loss on financial transactions has
been changed to net income/loss from the
trading portfolio.
On top of that, as an accompanying measure
to rule out abuse of law, reclassification
restrictions apply to the trading portfolio.
According to section 340e (3) sentences 2 to 4
of the German Commercial Code, financial
instruments may not be reclassified to thetrading portfolio retroactively. Reclassifying
financial instruments out of the trading port-
folio is permitted only if exceptional circum-
stances lead to the intent to trade being
abandoned. The act explicitly refers to severe
constraints on the tradability of financial in-
struments. Thus, legislators have responded
to the massive market disruptions triggered
by the financial crisis. However, a slump in
prices in itself does not justify reclassification.
In addition, reclassification out of the trading
portfolio is possible if the financial instru-
ments in question are included retrospectivelyCategorisation of financial instruments in accordance

53in hedging relationships in accordance with
the German Commercial Code. In this way,HGB rules governing reclassification differfrom the rules which the German BankingAct envisages for banks’ trading books, ac-cording to which financial instruments are tobe reclassified if the conditions for assign-ment to the trading book or the bankingbook no longer apply.
6In this context, banks’
internally defined, verifiable criteria play amajor role. Although they allow some har-monisation of the trading portfolio and thetrading book, deviations are justifiable foroperational reasons since, when defining thetrading book, greater importance can be at-tributed to the bank’s strategic intention. Bycontrast, greater objectivity is called for whendefining the trading portfolio in order to pre-vent abuse of law. When financial instru-ments are reclassified under HGB provisions,the last known fair value represents the newamortised cost for the following cost evalu-ation. This renders intentional profit shapinglargely impossible.
Risk haircutIn order to counter the risk of recognising
unrealised gains from financial instrumentsassigned to the trading portfolio as income,legislators have opted for a modified marketvaluation method. Thus, a risk haircut on theactual market values of financial instrumentsacquired for trading purposes is required.
Section 340e (3) sentence 1 of the German
Commercial Code stipulates that credit andfinancial services institutions must valuefinancial instruments in the trading portfolioat fair value minus a risk haircut. This haircut
is intended to take account of the probabilityof default of the unrealised gains. The actcontains no regulations on how the haircut isto be determined. Instead, the explanatorymemorandum to the act calls for an adequatecalculation method and refers to the banks’internal risk management according to regu-latory requirements. Legislators therefore as-sume that banking supervisors will monitorthe suitability of the calculation method andthe calculation parameters. The principal op-tion is to apply a value-at-risk-based haircut

using financial mathematics, although the le-gislative materials pertaining to the Act Mod-ernising Accounting Law do not expresslystate whether banks which calculate a VaRaccording to the Solvency Regulation

prudential purposes are also required to use itto determine the HGB haircut; certainly, it isappropriate if the institutions create conver-gence in this respect.

54calculated solely for the purpose of determin-
ing the HGB haircut. Instead, reference is
made to the institution’s appropriate internal
risk management in accordance with the Ger-
man Banking Act and the Minimum Require-
ments for Risk Management ( Mindestanfor-
derungen an das Risikomanagement ).
Where institutions’ internal risk management
models are used to measure regulatory cap-
ital, they are accepted by the Deutsche Bun-
desbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory
Authority ( Bundesanstalt f/C252r Finanzdienstleis-
tungsaufsicht – BaFin). Additionally, however,
other calculation procedures are already used
in banking. A risk-sensitive haircut may be
applied which, based on the minimum
requirements, reduces the market value by
potential trading portfolio losses. Moreover,using established and prudentially recognised
procedures creates synergies, produces an ap-
propriate harmonisation of the institution’s
internal risk management and the balance
sheet valuation, and ensures the comparabil-
ity of the risk haircuts applied.
Although the act explicitly mentions only a
risk haircut, trading liabilities will probably
have to be valued with a risk premium on the
fair value that satisfies the principle of pru-
dence in the same way.10
Risk reserve in section 340g of the
German Commercial Code
As the second means of preserving the HGB
principle of prudence alongside the fair value
haircut, section 340e (4) of the German Com-
mercial Code requires the accumulation of a
risk reserve.
Under this provision, 10% of net income
from the trading portfolio must be allocated
to the special item for general banking risks
pursuant to section 340g of the German
Commercial Code each financial year. These
allocations must be continued until 50% of
the average net annual income from the trad-
ing portfolio over the last five years has been
reached. This is based on the net income
from the trading portfolio after deducting the
risk haircut. The risk reserve is to be shown
separately, if necessary as an of which sub-
item, in the fund for general banking risks.

pulsory, and is therefore not at the discretionValuation and balance sheet

reserve introduced through the Act Modernising Accounting Law had applied since 2003. The simulation is based on the net income of financial operations, which is replaced under the Act Modernising Accounting Law by net income from the trading portfolio. — 2 The whole pillar represents the net income of financial opera-
tions based on the individual accounts pursuant to the Commercial Code; the hatched area represents the ficti-tious reduction of the net loss from financial operations through dissolution of the risk reserve pursuant to sec-tion 340e (4) of the Commercial Code.

56of the bank’s management. In this way, it ul-
timately acts as a block on dividend payments
using unrealised fair value gains, although
valuation gains are not the sole basis of the
calculation. In this respect, the restriction to
50% of the average net income appears justi-
fied and acceptable. Moreover, the risk re-
serve, like other amounts included in the
fund for general banking risks, counts as
tier 1 capital within the meaning of section
10 (2a) number 7 of the German Banking
Act.
As a general principle, the risk reserve may
only be dissolved to offset a net loss on the
trading portfolio. Furthermore, dissolution is
possible if the risk reserve exceeds 50% of
the average net annual income from the trad-
ing portfolio over the last five years. Accord-
ing to the wording of the law, when calculat-
ing this average, only financial years in which
a net income was generated are to be taken
into consideration.
Besides safeguarding against imponderables
resulting from the recognition of unrealised
valuation gains in trading in the income state-
ment, the risk reserve also has a countercycli-
cal impact. The interaction of its being
formed from trading gains and its dissolution
to cover trading losses tends to level institu-
tions’ net trading income. The risk reserve’s
relatively low upper limit serves to curtail its
countercyclical effect, however.
The valuation hierarchy of fair values
With the new subsection 4 of section 255 of
the German Commercial Code, legislatorshave, in terms of the valuation criteria, cre-
ated a fair value measurement hierarchy. This
step became necessary when fair value ac-
counting of institutions’ trading portfolios
was introduced, and in light of experiences
made with the financial crisis. Although the
act itself contains no legal definition of the
fair value, following international definitions,
the fair value according to section 255 (4) of
the German Commercial Code may be under-
stood to mean the amount for which an asset
could be exchanged, or a liability settled, be-
tween knowledgeable, willing parties in an
arm’s length transaction.11The fair value is,
as a general principle, equivalent to the mar-
ket price in an active market. If there is no ac-
tive market, the fair value is to be determined
using generally accepted valuation models
(such as, for example, option pricing models
and discounted cash flow models). As a fall-
back in this fair value measurement hierarchy,
the act stipulates the amortised cost valuation
methodology. In this context, the fair value
that was last determined is deemed to be the
amortised cost within the meaning of section
253 (4) of the Commercial Code.
In the financial crisis it proved difficult to
establish whether a price for a financial in-
strument qualified as a market price in an ac-
tive market. This became especially evident
when markets previously considered un-
doubtedly active became illiquid in just a
short space of time. In particular, migration in
the hierarchy of valuation methodologies
proved difficult when isolated market activ-
ities could still be observed. Thus, clear cri-

57teria are needed which spell out under what
circumstances a market qualifies as active
and when a valuation needs to be carried out
at the second hierarchy level using valuation
models. The act contains no criteria for distin-
guishing an active from an illiquid market.
According to the explanatory memorandum,
a market price can be deemed to have been
determined in an active market if, for ex-
ample, it is readily and regularly available on a
stock exchange and it is based on current and
regular market transactions between inde-
pendent third parties.
The migration within the fair value valuation
hierarchy, notably in tense market settings,
and the assessment of the valuation models –
particularly where complex structured finan-
cial instruments are concerned – are likely toremain two of the most difficult issues in the
fair value valuation of trading portfolios for
the reporting banks and their auditors, as
well as for prudential assessment purposes.
Recognising hedging relationships
The purpose of a valuation unit is to report a
hedging relationship in the balance sheet.
Without special rules on the accounting treat-
ment of hedging relationships, economically
sensible and, where applicable, completely
matched positions would not be adequately
reported in the balance sheet and the profit
and loss account by the one-sided recognition
of changes in value. The use of valuation
units is not unknown in German accounting
law. However, in accounting practice it wasValuation hierarchy pursuant to section 255 (4)

58initially based solely on a practice-oriented
interpretation of the GoB. The application of
compensatory valuation, which was de-
veloped through practice, enabled banks to
circumvent the problems that arose in con-
nection with the balance sheet treatment of
the strict application of the imparity principle
and the principle of individual evaluation.
This practical application is anchored in the
new section 254 of the German Commercial
Code in uniform, principles-oriented rules.
Where there is a valuation unit, use of the
principle of individual evaluation, the realisa-
tion principle, the imparity principle and the
amortised cost principle is restricted. For pru-
dential purposes, where a documented
hedge transaction has been conducted as
part of the bank’s internal risk management
operations, a valuation unit must be recog-
nised in the balance sheet in order, among
other things, to ensure an appropriate bal-
ance sheet treatment of the derivatives vis-/C224-
vis the banking book. Thus, unrealised losses
are not shown in the balance sheet if oppos-
ite changes in value or cash flows from the
same risks actually offset each other.
Hedgeable risks
With the help of section 254 of the German
Commercial Code, economic hedging strat-
egies against on-balance-sheet risks are to be
documented in the annual accounts. On-
balance-sheet risks are based on changes to
the fair value which lead, in the case of indi-
vidual evaluation, to an allowance or a write-
off, whereas the compensating change in
value has no effect on income. For this rea-son, it is necessary to set up valuation units to
achieve an accurate and appropriate reflec-
tion of the bank’s net asset position and prof-
itability.
A valuation unit whose purpose is to hedge
against a change in the fair value is a fair
value hedge. A cash flow hedge, on the other
hand, hedges the exposure to the variability
of the cash flow. Fluctuations can result from
a variety of risks such as price risk, interest
rate risk, equity risk and credit risk.
Hedgeable items
According to section 254 of the German
Commercial Code, assets, debt as well as firm
commitments and highly probably trans-
actions are eligible as hedgeable items.
The possibility to include expected trans-
actions in valuation units, and therefore to
include anticipatory hedging relationships in
the balance sheet, is an innovation. However,
it is only given if, first, the transaction has a
very high likelihood of materialising; second,
similar transactions have been realised in the
past; and third, adequate documentation has
been submitted and evidences the company’s
hedging strategy.
Reporting entities have relative freedom in
how they set up valuation units. In the case
of a micro hedge, a valuation unit is used to
hedge only one individual item against a
given risk. A portfolio hedge means that sev-
eral items can be included in one valuation
unit. With a macro hedge, all items subject toRestriction of

59a particular risk can be combined to form one
valuation unit.
Hedging instrumentsAccording to section 254 sentence 1 of the
German Commercial Code, financial instru-ments serve as hedges, although they are notdefined there either. However, one can referto section 1a (3) of the German Banking Actfor this purpose, which defines financialinstruments as all contracts which create afinancial asset for one of the parties involvedand a financial liability or a capital instrumentfor the other. Original financial instrumentsas well as derivatives whose underlying is afinancial instrument may serve as a hedginginstrument. Under section 254 sentence 2 ofthe German Commercial Code, the same ap-plies to derivatives whose underlying arecommodities, and which are used to hedgeagainst price risks.
Hedged items and hedging instruments may
be used to create a valuation unit only if theyare exposed to the same risk, yet respond tothat risk in opposite ways. Proof that thiscriterion is met must be provided, and the in-tention to hedge has to be documented. If avaluation unit is liquidated prematurely, aplausible reason must be given. Part-timehedges are possible if the hedge period is setin advance.
Checking the effectiveness of valuation
units
Proof must be provided that a valuation unit
is suitable as a means of offsetting the risk inquestion. Thus, it is necessary to measure the
extent to which opposite changes in value oropposite cash flows which were based on thesame risk led to the offset. If this offset wasincomplete or if there were mismatches intime, a distinction has to be made betweenthe effective and the ineffective part of thehedging relationship. The amortised costprinciple and the imparity principle must stillbe observed with regard to the ineffectivepart.
When checking the effectiveness, offsetting
effects may be considered in terms of theaggregate fair value or of only a change invalue owing to the hedged risk.
Reporting valuation units in balance
sheet and P/L account
A valuation unit can be reported in the
balance sheet using either the freezingmethod ( Einfrierungsmethode ) or the book-
ing through method ( Durchbuchungsme-
thode ). The former makes it unnecessary,
where a hedging relationship is effective, toadjust the instruments included and to expli-citly recognise the hedging relationship in thebalance sheet. Where the hedge covers onlypart of the risk, the imparity principle must beapplied for the unhedged part.
Booking through as prescribed by IAS 39
leads to all changes in value being recog-nised. In the profit and loss account theentries pertaining to changes in the value ofeffective hedging relationships balance eachother out. Thus, the valuation units and the

Need for change in recognition of
valuation units in practice
Although strictly retaining the procedure
which institutions were already using was
considered, the rule introduced through the
Act Modernising Accounting Law leads to aneed for change in the accounting of valu-
ation units. Particularly significant in this
respect are the method for reporting, and
measuring the effectiveness of, a hedging
relationship. Previously, a fixed valuation was
carried out along the lines of freezing, which
assumes the effectiveness – once it has been
determined – of a hedging relationship to be
given; as a result, the valuation unit is not
reassessed. Under the new legal provisions,
the effectiveness of a hedging relationship
has to be reviewed constantly, and any in-
effectiveness taken into account. It remains
to be seen what methods will be used in
practice in future.
Ultimately, therefore, it is particularly import-
ant when assessing an institution’s risk based
on the appropriate recognition of valuation
units that adequate and comparable proced-
ures are developed in practice.
It should be said at this point that under the
Act Modernising Accounting Law, too, not all
derivatives are reported in the balance sheet.
Trading portfolio derivatives and hedge
derivatives in valuation units, in the case of
which the booking through method is used,
are recognised. Where the freezing method is
applied, hedge derivatives are not shown in
the balance sheet; nor are the other deriva-
tives, notably interest rate derivatives to
hedge the banking book against general
interest rate risk. Suitable, objective solutions
for a loss-free valuation of the banking book
need to be developed in practice which guar-
antee that the changes in the values of all the
instruments included in the assessment are

61and the profit and loss account. Until then,
care should be taken to ensure the required
transparency of the information regarding
the fair value of financial derivatives in the
notes to the financial statement pursuant to
section 285 number 19 of the German Com-
mercial Code.
Consolidated accounting – consolidation
requirement
In the financial crisis, the consolidation regu-
lations proved to be a major weakness of
existing accounting regulations. Section 290
of the German Commercial Code was based
on two complementary concepts for deter-
mining whether a potential subsidiary had to
be included in the consolidated accounts of a
parent company. The so-called single man-
agement concept lacked specifics and could
be easily dodged. The supplementary control
concept was based on the control actually
exerted over a subsidiary by way of formal
corporate ties, and could be circumvented
with relative ease. The distribution of eco-
nomic opportunities and risks was secondary.
In the wake of the financial crisis, it became
evident that institutions had transferred –
sometimes large volumes of – risky assets to
special purpose entities (SPEs) which, because
the legal definition of control did not apply to
them, could be excluded from consolidation.
Ultimately, however, the institutions in ques-
tion had to assume the risks arising from
assets transferred to SPEs because of, for ex-
ample, existing liquidity facilities.Unlike the provisions of the German Com-
mercial Code, the IFRS consolidation rules are
based on an economic assessment of the dis-
tribution of opportunities and risks. Although
the actual consolidation standard IAS 2712is
likewise based on formal indicators of con-
trol, the special regulation for SPEs set forth
in SIC 1213proceeds from an economic per-
spective. Whenever the majority of the op-
portunities or risks resulting from an SPE rests
with the potential parent company, the SPE
must be included in the parent’s consolidated
accounts.
Revised version of the HGB consolidation
concept
On its own, the elimination, envisaged in the
government’s bill on the Act Modernising
Accounting Law, of the participation criterion
would probably not have achieved the object-
ive of a more extensive HGB consolidation
that includes SPEs. An originator will often
shy away from a participating interest in an
SPE precisely in order to evade the consolida-
tion requirement. For this reason, legislators
opted for a complete overhaul of the HGB
consolidation rules. Today, under the new
subsection 1 of section 290 of the German
Commercial Code, a potential subsidiary
must be included in the consolidated ac-
counts, even if control is merely possible –
whether or not a participating interest is held.
The criteria that define control are now set
forth in subsection 2, although these include,

ments.

62for the time being, the indicators of control
that have applied to date.
Consolidation of special purpose entities
A new feature has been introduced through
section 290 (2) number 4 of the German
Commercial Code, which contains a special
interpretation of control which is aimed pure-
ly at companies which are set up to achieve a
closely and clearly defined objective of the
parent company. These SPEs are deemed to
be potentially controlled by the parent if,
from an economic perspective, the parent
bears the majority of the risks and opportun-
ities. The explanatory memorandum refers
explicitly to the rules of SIC 12 of the IFRS,
and mentions also the indicators for control
which are listed there. In this connection, the
act deliberately defines what constitutes a
company in very broad terms in order to
offer, from the beginning, as little scope as
possible to circumvent the rule. However,
special funds within the meaning of section 2
(3) of the Investment Act ( Investmentgesetz )
have been deliberately excluded to prevent a
consolidation requirement on the basis solely
of an investment in such a fund, all the more
as, in this case, the fund shares are already
reported on the balance sheet.
Although the consolidation principles of IFRS,
through IAS 27 and SIC 12, have not always
proven sufficiently robust in practice, the
alignment of the HGB consolidation require-
ment with the internationally accepted stand-
ards is to be welcomed. When preparing IFRS
consolidated accounts, too, the requirement
to consolidate an SPE has occasionally beennegated on the basis of SIC 12 in a normal
scenario; yet taking an economic perspective
of the distribution of potential opportunities
and risks is the only way to thwart deliberate
evasive strategies – hence the need for re-
porting entities, auditors and supervisors to
work together to achieve an appropriate
practical application of the new consolidation
rules contained in the German Commercial
Code.
Impact on the supervisory consolidation
of groups of institutions
The supervisory consolidation of the own
funds of groups of institutions and financial
holding groups pursuant to section 10a of
the German Banking Act follows HGB con-
solidation according to the supervisory con-
solidation group pursuant to section 10a (1)
to (5) of the German Banking Act. The defin-
ition of the subordinated company in accord-
ance with section 10a (1) sentence 2 in con-
junction with section 1 (7) of the German
Banking Act takes as its starting point the
definition of the subsidiary company set forth
in section 290 of the German Commercial
Code, and thus the revised HGB consolidation
requirement.
The aim is to ensure that the supervisory con-
solidation of own funds does not lag behind
HGB consolidation requirements. As a gen-
eral principle, therefore, the consolidation
requirement which has been extended under
the German Commercial Code through the
Act Modernising Accounting Law ought also
to apply to SPEs launched, for example, in
connection with credit institutions’ securitisa-Economic view

63tion activities. Where risks arise for banking
groups as a result of such SPEs, and theserisks have already been adequately coveredelsewhere through prudential requirements,prudential consolidation could under certaincircumstances be dispensed with. Discussionswith the banking industry on this topic areongoing.
Effects on the formation of single
borrower units pursuant to section 19 (2)of the German Banking Act with regardto large exposures and loans of 51.5 mil-
lion or more
The expansion of the HGB consolidation
requirements has a knock-on effect on theformation of single borrower units pursuantto section 19 (2) of the German Banking Act.Although the criteria as to what constitutes a
group is based primarily on the definition setforth in the German Stock Corporation Act(Aktiengesetz ), section 290 (2) number 4 of
the German Commercial Code also containsan irrefutable presumption with regard tocontrolling influence, which in turn meets thecriteria of what constitutes a group pursuantto section 18 (1) sentence 1 in conjunctionwith section 17 (1) of the German Stock Cor-poration Act. Hence it follows that enter-prises which are consolidated in accordancewith the German Commercial Code by theirparent company must also be included in thesingle borrower unit of that parent.

Maturity matching
In theory, provisions can have any given maturity. In this 
context, those for post-employment beneﬁ t o bligations, 
in parti cular, may span several decades.  Hen ce, in or der 
to ensure that discount rates are maturity mat ched, a yiel d 
curve, whi ch plots the relationship between the interest rate 
and the time to maturity, is nee ded whi ch exten ds into the 
desire d maturity perio d of the provision. For the purpose of 
calculatin g yiel d curves with a lon g maturity, it is a dvisa ble 
to choose un derlyin g ﬁ nan cial instruments whi ch have a 
similarly lon g maturity. Moreover, sin ce a yiel d curve depi cts 
merely one relationship between a given maturity an d a 
given interest rate, the ﬁ  nan cial instruments use d shoul d also 
be as homo geneous as possi ble with re gard to their credit 
quality an d other features. De bt se curities with a low quality 
or a hi gh annual coupon generate a different market yiel d 
to safe paper or instruments whose interest is not pai d out 
until the en d of their life (zero- coupon bon ds). Ultimately, 
the metho d of calculation has to be transparent an d repro-
ducible, provi de a goo d ﬁ t with o bserve d market yiel ds an d 
deliver “smooth ” curves without any kinks or breaks. The last 
of these criteria is desi gned to ensure that any deviations or 
distortions in the yiel d of in dividual se curities do not impa ct 
signiﬁ cantly on nei ghbourin g maturities.
Averaging
The use of market interest rates when discountin g provi-
sions ena bles a more realisti c representation of the a ctual 
obligations that exist; however, this approa ch also lea ds to 
ﬂ uctuations in the proﬁ  t an d loss a ccount owin g to interest rate chan ges. Simulations usin g the Deuts che Bun desbank’s 
Finan cial Statements Data Pool have demonstrate d that 
ﬂ uctuations in performan ce, base d upon chan ges to com-
pany pension reserves, can be kept in check by applyin g a 
market interest rate that is calculate d as the avera ge of the 
pre ceding seven years. This is attri buta ble to the fa ct that, in 
relation to the central bank interest rate, the len gth of ea ch 
of the last six interest rate cycles sin ce 19 60 has avera ged just 
un der seven years. Since lon ger-term yiel ds generally follow 
these interest rate patterns as well, a “smoothin g” over a 
seven-year perio d is si gniﬁ cantly more effe ctive than over 
ﬁ ve years as initially envisa ged.
Yield level
When discountin g, it is primarily the level, that is to say the 
absolute level, of the discount rates whi ch determines the 
present value of the provisions. A ccording to international 
accountin g stan dards (e g IA S 19.78) this shoul d be geare d 
to the market yiel ds of “high quality corporate bon ds“. Such 
pegging to corporate bon ds with a ratin g of AA (Aa), whi ch 
can be a chieve d without mu ch a do in, say, the U SA an d 
the UK with their lar ge share of capital market ﬁ  nan cing, 
is impe ded in Germany’s bank- base d ﬁ nan cial system by a 
pau city of this kin d of bon d.  Even if, as an expe dient, cor-
porate bon ds from all of the EEA mem ber states were to be 
referre d to in a ggregate this woul d not, at present, fa cilitate 
a relia ble estimation of yiel d curves in the lon g-term maturity 
segment. In pra ctice, therefore, corporate bon d yiel ds are 
not, as a rule, use d for estimatin g one’s own yiel d curve but 
for calculatin g a mark-up on a yiel d curve derive d from Fe d-
eral se curities (Bun ds) or from swaps.  To this en d, the yiel d

include the mark-up as the differen ce between the maturity 
mat ched seven-year avera ges of all corporate bon d yiel ds 
and the seven-year mean value of the swap curve.  This 
mark-up is then uniformly a dded to the swap curve a cross 
the entire maturity, with the result that it is also extrapolate d 
beyon d the lon gest maturity of the corporate bon ds. Said 
pro cedure is extrapolate d forwar ds over su bsequent months, 
in other wor ds the seven-year win dow is move d alon g by one 
month, there by allowin g the simple, transparent calculation 
of a “smooth-ﬂ  owin g” curve path.  For sta bility reasons, it 
is ina dvisa ble to create mark-ups on the basis of maturity 
bands or to extrapolate the yiel d of the last maturity band 
or the yiel d of the bon d with the lon gest maturity. The lon g-
est bon d metho d takes 100 % account of any yiel d chan ges 
experien ced by in dividual bon ds, while the last maturity 
band approa ch consi ders 8 %. By comparison, if the avera ge 
yiel d of all bon ds is extrapolate d, this ﬁ  gure stan ds at a mere 
0.4 %.5 Despite the limite d duration6 of the avera ge a cross 
all bon ds, the position of the resultin g mark-up is just a few 
basis points below that of a mark-up calculate d, say, solely 
on the basis of the yiel d of the last maturity band. This is 
a conse quen ce of the way in whi ch the maturities of the 
individual bon ds are distri bute d as well as of the dispersion 
of their avera ge yiel ds. Over 50 % of the bon ds fall into the 
bottom two maturity bands (up to ﬁ  ve years). The avera ge 
maturities in the bands have a dispersion of two to eleven 
years, while the correspon ding avera ge yiel ds lie within a 
mu ch narrower ran ge of 2½ % to 5¼ % per annum. Given 
this fa ct, the hi gh num ber of bon ds with shorter maturities is 
incline d to re duce the maturity rather than lower the yiel d.
Discount ratesIn line with these prin ciples, the Bun desbank calculates a 
zero- coupon interest rate swap curve usin g euro- denomi-
nate d plain vanilla swaps. Un der a plain vanilla swap, the 
counterparties ex chan ge ﬁ xe d, as a rule annual interest 
payments for a ﬂ  oatin g interest rate, usually the six-month 
EURIBOR, quotin g full-year maturities up to an d aroun d the 50-year mark. As interest payments are ex chan ged 
throu ghout the entire duration of the transa ction – in most 
cases on ce a year – the ﬁ  xe d interest rates for su ch swaps 
are converte d
 into zero- coupon swap rates.7 Missin g or 
illiquid an d therefore unuse d maturities are interpolate d, 
on the assumption that forwar d interest rates will remain 
constant. This makes it possi ble, parti cularly in the lon g-term 
maturity se gment where tra ding is con centrate d on “roun d” 
maturities, to deliver a smooth-ﬂ  owin g curve. The rates use d 
for the discountin g of provisions are ultimately generate d 
by imposin g a uniform mark-up. The discount rates an d the 
uniform mark-up applie d across the entire swap curve clearly

66number 4 of the German Commercial Code
has been added – as to what constitutes con-
trol with regard to the formation of single
borrower units. However, in individual cases,
institutions and auditors seem to take differ-
ent views on the need to consolidate SPEs
in accordance with the German Commercial
Code. This is probably due primarily to the
legal implications that HGB consolidation has
in terms of limiting large exposures to SPEs.
For this reason, the legality of the impact of
section 290 (2) number 4 of the German
Commercial Code on the formation of single
borrower units on the basis of the new
criteria on what constitutes a group is being
questioned by sections of the banking indus-
try. Yet the very objective was that credit insti-
tutions should not be able to circumvent
prudential ratios by transferring assets to
SPEs, ie that they do not, for example, under-
mine upper large exposure limits by setting
up more and more SPEs. However, German
bank supervisors have yet to adopt a final
stance in this question and define the scope
of application. Their task will be to ensure
that the aim behind the expansion of the
HGB consolidation rules, namely to prevent
the circumvention of consolidation require-
ments, is taken into account in connection
with the large exposure limits, too.
Information in the notes (section 285 of
the German Commercial Code)
With the Act Modernising Accounting Law,
the information to be given in the notes
pursuant to section 285 of the German
Commercial Code has also been adjusted.The changes reflect experiences made in the
financial crisis and seek to improve transpar-
ency in the areas in which measures to inter-
nationalise the German Commercial Code
have tended to water down the principle of
prudence.
The most important changes concern the
extended or added compulsory information
about off-balance-sheet transactions as well
as about (derivative) financial instruments
and valuation units.
The revised section 285 number 3 of the Ger-
man Commercial Code requires that infor-
mation be given concerning the type and
purpose, as well as the risks and rewards of
transactions not shown in the balance sheet,
if this information is necessary for assessing
the financial situation of the company in
question. In particular, the experiences made
in the financial crisis, which revealed that
risks had been masked by transferring them
to off-balance-sheet SPEs, led to the inclusion
of this provision, under which information
must be provided on transactions which
might be linked, above all, to SPEs or offshore
transactions, except where they are already
consolidated anyway.
Under the revised number 19, information
now has to be provided on derivative finan-
cial instruments that are not stated at fair
value. By contrast, the notes are not required
to contain information about the derivative
financial instruments assigned to the trading
portfolio (section 340e (3) of the German
Commercial Code).Intragroup

67Related to the above, under number 20, in-
formation on financial instruments assigned
to the trading portfolio is compulsory. In par-
ticular, details have to be provided on the
basic assumptions made when determining
fair value using generally accepted valuation
methods.
Number 23 stipulates that the valuation units
in accordance with section 254 of the Ger-
man Commercial Code be broken down by
hedged risk; additionally, a differentiation is
to be made between the types of valuation
units formed, with anticipatory valuation
units to be shown separately. Moreover, infor-
mation on the effectiveness of each valuation
unit has to be included. And finally, the notes
must show how this ties in with the compa-
ny’s risk management.
Changes to the Credit Institution
Accounting Regulation
The changes made to the Act Modernising
Accounting Law also have implications for
the Credit Institution Accounting Regulation.
In addition to the introduction of the trading
portfolio as a balance sheet item, the require-
ment for the notes to contain a breakdown
of the asset-side trading portfolio into deriva-
tive financial instruments, claims, debt secur-
ities and other fixed-income securities, shares
and other variable-yield securities as well as
other assets, and of the liabilities-side trading
portfolio into derivative financial instruments
and liabilities, has been anchored in section
35 (1) of the Credit Institution AccountingRegulation. Moreover, information also has to
be given on, for example, the method used
to determine the risk haircut, the reasons for
any reclassifications, the amount of the re-
classified financial instruments as well as the
effect of the reclassification on the annual re-
sult. Information must, moreover, be provided
on the extent to which the institutions’ in-
ternal criteria for the inclusion of financial
instruments in the trading portfolio have
changed during the financial year, and on the
impact this has had on the annual result.
The pro-rata amount of the net income from
the trading portfolio to be allocated to the
fund for general banking risks in accordance
with section 340e (4) of the German Com-
mercial Code must be reported separately.
The new forms 1 (balance sheet), 2 and 3
(profit and loss account – account form and
staggered form) of the Credit Institution
Accounting Regulation as a result of the
revised version of the German Commercial
Code following the Act Modernising Ac-
counting Law are available in the internet.14
Accounting rules will always be subject to
change. International accounting in particular
having lost some of its credibility in the wake
of the financial crisis, it is vital to rebuild con-
fidence. German legislators have made a
valuable contribution to re-establishing the
credibility of financial reporting with the Act
Modernising Accounting Law.

69Supervisory disclosure under Pillar 3 of Basel II
Comprehensive and timely transparency about all relevant activities of financial market partici-
pants is a fundamental precondition for ensuring that the financial markets can function properly.
As supervisory disclosure under Pillar 3 of Basel II was first implemented in the 2008 financial
year, it was unable to exert any market-disciplining effects either in the run-up to or during the
outbreak of the crisis. It therefore comes as no surprise that the G20 countries placed the focus
of their crisis resolution measures on disclosure as well. In addition, with the entry into force of
Basel II with effect from 2008, supervisors now also need to oversee compliance with the new
Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.
A representative analysis of Pillar 3 disclosure reports shows that, although most institutions are
largely compliant with the new prudential requirements, in individual cases there is still room for
improvement. One desirable improvement – even though the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision expressly avoided mandating a specific disclosure format – would be greater syn-
chronicity in the form of information disclosure. Although the non-binding formats developed
nationally are, in principle, suited to enhancing comparability of information, institutions and
individual groups of institutions are using these application examples differently. Supervisors’
efforts to achieve greater convergence in reporting practices are also an outgrowth of European
activities; in that vein, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), identified certain
“best practices” for adequate Pillar 3 disclosures in a cross-country comparison of disclosure
reports. The Bundesbank believes that the only way for improvement will ultimately lie in making
certain formats for the disclosure of quantitative information mandatory; institutions would then
add the required qualitative annotations.
The provision of data also has room for efficiency gains. Institutions should comply with Pillar 3
disclosure requirements by structuring their data warehouses so as to create a one-stop technical
platform which can meet the various reporting requirements for accounting, capital market regu-
lation and prudential supervisory purposes. This provides an opportunity to convey information
clearly and consistently. The informational value of Pillar 3 risk data can also be enhanced by
ensuring that they are largely consistent with the contents of internal risk reports.

70Disclosure as a new prudential
requirement
The third pillar of the revised capital framework
published on 26 June 2004 by the Basel Com-
mittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) codified
supervisory disclosure requirements for institu-
tions and groups of institutions for the first
time.1They are consistent with the idea of
using market mechanisms as a complement to
traditional banking supervision, which were
already laid out in a very general form by the
Basel Committee in September 1997 in its
“Core Principles”.2These principles identify
the disclosure of meaningful, comprehensive,
timely and accurate information permitting
third parties to assess an institution’s risk as a
key feature of effective banking supervision.
Market actors need this information so that
market forces can exert discipline and stable
and efficient financial markets can be pro-
moted.
Supervisory disclosure requirements are
geared to the provision of information on
risks incurred (counterparty credit risk, market
risk and operational risk) and institutions’
risk-bearing capacity (the structure and ad-
equacy of their own funds).
Such aspects have also made inroads into ex-
ternal accounting. The binding international
accounting standards3under which publicly
traded companies in the EU are required to
prepare consolidated financial statements
also provide for the disclosure of information
on the firm-specific risk situation so that in-
vestors can examine expected future profit,
the feature at the centre of their interest,from a risk-oriented perspective. Conse-
quently, IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Dis-
closures”, which is particularly significant for
banks owing to their business structure, re-
quires the disclosure of information on the
significance of financial instruments for the
entity and on the nature and extent of the
associated risks, such as credit risk, liquidity
risk and market risk. Similar provisions can
be found in the German Accounting Stan-
dard ( Deutscher Rechnungslegungs Standard
(DRS)) 5-10, “Risk Reporting by Financial
Companies”,4which was adopted by the
German accounting standards setter
Deutsches Rechnungslegungs Standards
Committee e. V. (DRSC) in August 2000 and
which served as a blueprint for the develop-
ment of IFRS 7.5
Supervisory disclosure requirements are fun-
damentally consistent with those for external
accounting purposes. Supervisory disclosures
of information on risk incurred should there-
fore also automatically largely meet external
1On 4 July 2006, the BCBS issued a comprehensive ver-
sion of the new capital framework containing the June
2004 Basel II Framework, the 1996 Amendment to the
Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks, and the
paper on the Application of Basel II to Trading Activities
and the Treatment of Double Default Effects.
2Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Core Prin-
ciples for Effective Banking Supervision, September 1997,
Disclosure. In October 2006, the Basel Committee pub-
lished a revised version of its “Core Principles”. Much like
its predecessor, Principle 22 of the current version calls
for regular publication of reports based on internationally
accepted accounting standards that fairly reflect the insti-
tution’s financial condition and profitability. This principle
is also fleshed out by the “Core Principles Methodology”
of October 2006.

71accounting requirements. By contrast, dis-
closure under IFRS 7 or DRS 5-10 does not
automatically meet supervisory requirements
as the latter are more detailed and refer to
internationally harmonised supervisory prac-
tices when defining the information to be dis-
closed. Both regulatory systems are oriented
to internal management systems which, in
the case of banks, are characterised by the
Minimum Requirements for Risk Manage-
ment ( Mindestanforderungen an das Risiko-
management, or MaRisk).6The idea is thus to
be able to use a single, consistent pool of
data.
Moreover, putting the various risk reporting
requirements on a consistent conceptual
basis ensures, not least in the interest of con-
sistent capital market communication, that
internal and external corporate communica-
tion are in harmony with one another (man-
agement approach).
Transposition into national law in the
German Banking Act
The fundamental provisions governing dis-
closure are contained in section 26a of the
German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ).
This section was inserted in early 2007 with
binding effect from the 2008 financial year. It
transposes Chapter 5 (Disclosure by credit in-
stitutions) of the recast Directive 2006/48/EC
(hereinafter referred to as the Banking Direct-
ive) into national law. Section 26a of the Ger-
man Banking Act contains a general require-
ment that quantitative and qualitative infor-
mation on capital, risk and risk managementmethods be disclosed regularly. It additionally
requires credit institutions to draw up an in-
ternal policy for compliance with disclosure
requirements, such as a “disclosure manual”,
including regular verification of disclosure
practice.
Where they have a legitimate interest in non-
disclosure, institutions may be exempted
from the requirement to disclose certain in-
formation. Legitimate interest of institutions
may be constituted by those cases where the
information is immaterial, protected by law
or confidential. In cases of information that
is protected by law or is confidential, the
interest of the recipients in the disclosure of
this information is subordinated to that of
the institutions. Single entities within a group
are also generally not subject to disclosure
requirements. Only major subsidiaries are
required to disclose their tier 1 and overall
capital ratios.
Compliance with disclosure requirements is
monitored by banking supervisors. The
Deutsche Bundesbank’s Regional Offices
represent the first link in the monitoring
chain. If an institution fails to meet its disclos-
ure requirements properly, the Federal Finan-
cial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt f/C252r
Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, or BaFin) may
issue an order requiring disclosure. If this
order is wilfully or negligently disregarded,
this constitutes an administrative offence
which is punishable by a fine of up to
3150,000.

72Compliance with section 26a of the German
Banking Act must be formally audited by the
auditor of the annual accounts. Pursuant to
the specific provisions of section 18 of the
Audit Report Regulation ( Pr/C252fungsberichts-
verordnung, or Pr/C252fbV), the external auditor
is required to assess the adequacy of the pro-
cesses for obtaining and disclosing informa-
tion. The auditor is also required to explicitly
state in the audit report whether or not the
institution is in compliance with the disclosure
requirements.
Concretisation by means of the Solvency
Regulation
The fundamental statutory provisions on
disclosure are concretised in Part 5 of theSolvency Regulation ( Solvabilit/C228tsverordnung,
or SolvV). The part on disclosure spans sec-
tions 319 to 337 and is divided into three
chapters. Chapter 1 contains fundamental
provisions on the scope of application (sec-
tion 319), the disclosure medium (section
320) and the disclosure frequency (section
321).
Chapter 2 contains general requirements re-
garding the information to be disclosed
(sections 322 to 334). Mandatory disclosures
usually include qualitative and quantitative
information on own funds and the risk situ-
ation. Disclosures on own funds include the
structure of own funds and capital adequacy.
With regard to risk management, disclosures
for each risk category should include the aim
and methodology of risk management, along
with its organisational structure, hedging
strategies, and internal reporting lines and
control functions. All these guidelines are
intended to help understand and structure
the quantitative information.
Chapter 3 contains additional information
requirements for disclosure when institutions
use particular procedures or instruments
recognised by supervisors (sections 335 to
337). They apply to institutions that use
internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches to
measure counterparty credit risk, comprehen-
sive credit risk mitigation techniques to
reduce risk or advanced measurement ap-
proaches (AMA) to calculate operational risk.Disclosure provisions in the Banking Act
– Regular disclosure of qualitative and quanti-
tative information on capital, risk and risk
management procedures (section 26a (1) sen-
tence 1 of the Banking Act)
– Existence of formal procedures and rules for
compliance with disclosure requirements (sec-
tion 26a (1) sentence 1 of the Banking Act)
– Regular review of the appropriateness and
usefulness of disclosure (section 26a (1) sen-
tence 2 of the Banking Act)
– Waiver of disclosure for immaterial, legally
protected or confidential information (section
26a (2) of the Banking Act)
– Group disclosure at the highest consolidation
level only (section 26a (4) of the Banking Act)
– Possibility of prudential sanctions with fines
up to 5150,000 (section 26a (3) in conjunction
with section 56 (3) number 5 and (5) of the
Banking Act)

When the financial crisis broke out in 2007,
the rules on Pillar 3 disclosures had, for all
practical purposes, not yet taken effect
throughout the world. It also turned out that
the disclosure requirements, especially those
on securitisations, were not sufficiently spe-
cific to comprehensively and completely iden-
tify the transactions that triggered the finan-
cial crisis. That is also true of the disclosure
requirements contained in international ac-
counting standards. The lack of transparency,
for its part, fostered an atmosphere of mutual
distrust among market participants, causing
the interbank market, which is vital for insti-
tutions’ wholesale funding, to more or less
grind to a halt. That, in turn, exacerbated the
crisis.
Therefore, the Financial Stability Forum
(FSF),7in its April 2008 report to the G7
finance ministers and central bank governors,
identified enhanced transparency, especially
in the area of securitisations, as a key precon-
dition for restoring confidence among market
participants and thus also for strengthening
the resilience of the global financial system.8
The immediate response was to call on the in-
stitutions concerned to present meaningful
disclosures of their on-balance sheet and off-
balance sheet risks of particular relevance to
the financial market crisis, beginning with the
mid-year 2008 reports. With regard to the
specific framing of this disclosure require-
ment, the FSF referred to the disclosure prac-tices identified by the Senior Supervisors
Group.9
The FSF regards its disclosure recommenda-
tions as a complement to, rather than as a
substitute for, existing disclosure require-
ments for risk information, including the
requirements under Pillar 3 of Basel II. They
should be followed for financial reporting
until the Basel Committee’s enhancements to
Pillar 3 have entered into force.Recommendations of the Financial
Stability Forum regarding disclosure
The FSF issued a total of three disclosure recommen-
dations.
– FSF recommendation III.1 is directly addressed to
institutions with immediate effect. It strongly
encourages – beginning with the mid-year 2008
reports – robust disclosure of risk information in
accordance with leading disclosure practices.
– FSF recommendation III.2 calls on investors,
financial industry representatives and auditors, in
the medium term, to work together towards
improving disclosure practices. Principles for use-
ful disclosures are to be developed to this end. In
addition, the aforementioned groups should
meet semi-annually to discuss the main risks to
the financial sector and identify the most rele-
vant and useful types of disclosure.
– FSF recommendation III.3 is addressed to super-
visors and calls on the Basel Committee on Bank-
ing Supervision to strengthen Pillar 3 disclosure
requirements likewise over the medium term for
a predefined list of issues.

74The FSB attaches great importance to the
strict implementation of the FSF disclosure
recommendations. It has therefore launched
an institutionalised control procedure, known
as a “thematic peer review”, to obtain feed-
back on implementation by major financial
institutions across the globe. The focus of the
analysis is on risk disclosures relating to
securitisation exposures. Specific information
being requested covers special purpose en-
tities (SPEs), collateralised debt obligations
(CDOs), other subprime and Alt-A exposures,
commercial mortgage-backed securities
(CMBS) and leveraged finance. The eight
institutions for Germany relevant for these
business activities and included in the survey
make up 58% of the national market in
terms of the balance sheet total in 2009.
There is a wide variety of forms in which this
information is disclosed. The information is
disclosed both in the annual financial state-
ment and in Pillar 3 reports. In addition, some
institutions publish a separate FSB report. In
terms of content, the key aspects are largely
covered by all institutions. The FSB assess-
ment requirements, however, are broken
down to a high degree of detail. Some of the
sub-items in the template are disclosed by
only a very few surveyed institutions. How-
ever, this appears appropriate given the insti-
tutions’ focus on issues of particular rele-
vance.
The Committee of European Banking Super-
visors (CEBS), which entered into existence as
an institution in 2004, has likewise been
increasingly concerning itself with disclosure-
related issues since the outbreak of the finan-cial crisis. At the request of the Economic and
Financial Affairs Council of the European
Union (Ecofin Council), CEBS has published
several papers examining the disclosure prac-
tices of European credit institutions in their
financial reporting.10
An initial analysis identified, for European
banks, “good practices for disclosures” based
on 2007 annual financial statements. Al-
though these practices are largely consistent
with the FSF’s disclosure recommendations,
CEBS’s observed good practices also include
disclosures of the business model and on the
balance-sheet treatment and valuation of the
relevant exposures.
The recent evaluation of the 2009 financial
statements indicates that the CEBS disclosure
recommendations have been incorporated to
a significant degree into the financial report-
ing practices of European credit institutions.
This applies particularly to disclosures of the
business model, risk management and busi-
ness involvement in subprime mortgage ac-
tivities. However, fair value accounting, the
reclassification of financial instruments, the
formation of provisions and the derecognition
of exposures all contain room for improve-
ment.

75Moreover, CEBS also analyses, at European
level, supervisory disclosure practices.11The
entry into force of Pillar 3 in the EU with
effect from the 2008 financial year led to two
comparative studies. The first such study like-
wise identified “CEBS best practices”. The
analysis for the 2009 financial year showed
that institutions are taking these recommen-
dations seriously, especially regarding disclos-
ures of economic capital calculation, counter-
party credit risk and operational risk. By
contrast, there appears to be a need for im-
provement in disclosures of the composition
of own funds, backtesting results for credit
risk and the use of credit risk mitigation tech-
niques and credit derivatives.
Strictly speaking, the guidelines and advice
issued by CEBS are not formally binding.
However, the publication of the results of the
studies gives the CEBS recommendations an
informal binding impact on institutions that
should not be taken lightly.
Adequate risk disclosures, especially in times
of crisis, cannot be obtained by compulsory
hard-and-fast disclosure rules. The causes of
financial crises are different every time. More-
over, developing formal rules requires a cer-
tain lead-time, which means that they cannot
be invoked for timely first-time disclosures. It
would appear more appropriate, by contrast,
to sensitise market participants to the import-
ance of situation-specific adequate disclosure
of up-to-date risk information. Based on this
insight, CEBS additionally developed general
requirements for adequate risk disclosures.12The European banking industry is likewise
interested in a certain convergence of disclos-
ure activities. Negotiations on this issue have
been conducted under the auspices of the
European Banking Federation (EBF). Although
the original goal of harmonising all Pillar 3
disclosure practices could not be achieved,
four European banking associations (Euro-
pean Banking Federation, Association for
Financial Markets in Europe, European Sav-
ings Bank Group and European Association
of Public Banks and Funding Agencies)
reached an agreement on good practice
guidelines for quantitative and qualitative
securitisation disclosures.13
National monitoring procedures
The national supervisory agencies have, from
the very beginning, attached great import-
ance to the proper implementation of the FSF
disclosure recommendations. Regular evalu-
ation of annual reports has shown that Ger-
man institutions have complied with the spirit
of the additional disclosure requirements in
the wake of the financial crisis. Isolated cases
show room for improvement in how the dis-
closures are presented.
Compliance with the Pillar 3 disclosure re-
quirements in 2009 was assessed by analys-
ing a sample of 14 publicly traded institutions
which represent more than 70% of the total

76assets of the German banking industry. Dis-
closure reports were analysed using the cri-
teria applied at European level. The results of
the analysis showed that, overall, Pillar 3 of
Basel II is being adequately complied with
and that compliance is on a par with the rest
of Europe.
All of the analysed institutions publish separ-
ate Pillar 3 disclosure reports on their web-
sites; eight institutions also cross-reference
information from their risk reports. In individ-
ual cases, however, clearer reference to the
source would be desirable. The superiority of
full supervisory disclosure in a separate report
is also demonstrated by a comparison with
practices in other European countries.
Disclosures should be made as soon as prac-
ticable in the light of the availability of data
and roughly at the same time as the publica-
tion of the annual accounts. However, the
flexibility granted with regard to the time of
disclosure has been exploited by some institu-
tions – also by comparison with practices
elsewhere in Europe – in a manner unaccept-
able to supervisors. The “Guidelines for as-
sessing compliance with disclosure require-
ments pursuant to section 26a of the German
Banking Act” ( Leitlinien zur Bewertung der
Erf/C252llung der Offenlegungsanforderungen
nach § 26a KWG ) therefore require publica-
tion within four weeks after approval of the
annual accounts.
Basel II mandates the semi-annual disclosure
of information under Pillar 3, whereas the EU
directive settles for annual disclosure. As it
is the EU directive that is transposed intonational law, it is the annual disclosure fre-
quency that applies to German institutions.
Four of the banks in the study have addition-
ally voluntarily published a mid-year Pillar 3
report. Should this practice take root inter-
nationally, German institutions will be all but
compelled to follow suit.
Methods of presenting the individual areas of
disclosure have undergone a harmonisation
of sorts. The use cases developed by the ex-
pert panel on disclosure requirements, com-
posed of supervisors and financial industry
representatives, have certainly played a role in
this. This development is to be assessed posi-
tively, not least as it renders disclosures com-
parable, which is important to market partici-
pants.
The disclosed information is not subject to a
mandatory external audit. Instead, it is up to
the institution itself to verify the disclosed
information and the full disclosure thereof.
Although the formal procedures and rules for
integrating disclosure requirements into the
bank’s internal control systems are themselves
not disclosed, explicit details on the existence
of a formal disclosure policy are expected – in
the European context as well. Only three of
the surveyed institutions commented on this
issue.
The requirements for disclosures on own
funds (own funds structure and capital
adequacy) are adequately met by just over
three-quarters of the institutions. In isolated
cases, the qualitative presentation of the key
features of capital components and the de-
scription of economic capital are too general.

77Guidelines for assessing compliance with disclosure requirements
General guidelines
– Supervisors must object to the full waiver of disclo-
sure under section 26a of the Banking Act for rea-
sons of materiality.
– If key information that is fundamentally required to
be disclosed is not disclosed, or not disclosed com-
pletely, supervisors must object unless the institu-
tion provides plausible and understandable reasonsfor non-disclosure of this information. In order tomake disclosures uniquely assignable, institutions, if
in doubt, should indicate the immateriality of dis-
closure requirements by explicitly stating “nil re-port”.
– Errors found in the disclosure report are to be recti-
fied.
Reference to section 26a (2) of the Banking Act
– Plausible and objectively understandable reasons
must be given for non-disclosure if materiality andconfidentiality are cited. The following reasons are
insufficient.
– Reference to the cross-offsetting option permit-
ted pursuant to section 340f (3) and (4) of the
German Commercial Code.
– Reference to a hierarchy of rules, eg in connec-
tion with section 340f of the German Commercial
Code.
– Sole reference to exceptions from disclosure re-
quirements under section 26a (2) of the German
Banking Act; or
– General reference to a potential weakening of
competitiveness.
Publication
– Supervisors must object to any failure to comply
with section 320 (2) of the Solvency Regulation re-
quiring confirmation of publication in the electronicversion of the Federal Gazette and the associatednotification of supervisors.
– Information to be disclosed pursuant to Part 5 of
the Solvency Regulation is to be published not laterthan four weeks after approval of the annual ac-
counts.
– The disclosure report must be available until the
next disclosure report has been published.– If, in order to comply with disclosure requirements,
an institution makes use of the option to refer toother disclosure media pursuant to section 320 (1)sentence 2 of the Solvency Regulation, these refe-
rences must embrace and ensure clear access to the
relevant information.
– Electronic access to the information pursuant to
Part 5 of the Solvency Regulation must not be
impeded by requiring prior registration by name.
– It must be ensured that an electronically available
disclosure report can be printed out.
Specific guidelines
– Key definitions of terms such as “past due” and “im-
paired” (section 327 (1) number 1 of the SolvencyRegulation) have to be requested.
– The description of risk management pursuant to
section 322 of the Solvency Regulation may bewaived only if reference is made to comparable dis-closure elsewhere.
– Supervisors must object to the complete non-disclo-
sure of information about the terms and conditionsof the main features of all own funds items pursuant
to section 324 (1) of the Solvency Regulation. The re-
levant information has to be released particularlywith respect to hybrid tier 1 capital instruments.
– For regionally active institutions, a geographical
breakdown of exposures into “Germany”, “EU” and“Other” will generally be sufficient to meet the dis-closure requirements pursuant to section 327 (2)
number 2 of the Solvency Regulation (geographical
distribution of exposures).
– Regarding the disclosure of exposures broken down
by industry or counterparty type pursuant to section
327 (2) number 3 of the Solvency Regulation, abreakdown by industry is expected; it is not enoughto classify counterparties as “individuals” and “cor-
porates”.
– Information on risk provisioning pursuant to section
327 (2) numbers 5 and 6 of the Solvency Regulation
must be disclosed.
– If equities in the banking book are disclosed pur-
suant to section 332 (2) of the Solvency Regulation
only at balance-sheet values, plausible and objec-
tively understandable reasons for the non-disclosureof their present value or listed market price must bepresented.

78Whereas most disclosure requirements are
oriented to the relevant rules under Pillar 1,
the general information on credit risk tends
to be more closely related to accounting prac-
tices. Both the qualitative disclosures in this
area and the quantitative breakdown of lend-
ing according to various criteria (eg geo-
graphical dispersion, business line, residual
maturity, risk provisioning) are fully met by
nearly all institutions. Although the study
shows that, on an overall average, disclosure
requirements for counterparty credit risk
when using the IRB approach are being satis-
factorily met, most institutions are still show-
ing room for improvement in describing the
internal rating process and also with regard
to quantitative presentation. Up to and in-
cluding 2008, the minimum requirement is a
backtesting comparison of the bank’s own
estimated loss with actual losses over one
period. From year-end 2009 onwards, dis-
closed backtesting results have to cover a
longer period.
Banking supervisors will in future also con-
tinue to monitor compliance with the letter
and the spirit of the Pillar 3 disclosure require-
ments. If individual details are not disclosed
owing to their immateriality, banks will be re-
quired to enter an explicit “nil report” in
cases of doubt.
Institutions that are not publicly traded or
which operate primarily regionally or locally
are particularly likely to have questions con-
cerning the proper application of Pillar 3. Al-
though the vast majority of these institutions
comply with Pillar 3 disclosure requirements
to the proper extent and in the proper form,a relatively small number of institutions still
have some problems regarding interpretation.
In individual cases, institutions refuse to sub-
mit any disclosure at all, citing immateriality.
In some cases, confidentiality is invoked as a
reason for disclosing only part of the neces-
sary information on risk. In the light of these
deficiencies, supervisors have drawn up con-
crete good practices for disclosure, intended
to be a yardstick for the internal review of
sufficient disclosure by the Deutsche Bundes-
bank’s regional offices. However, they are
also designed to function as a starting point
for any additional measures that supervisors
may need to take.
Upcoming changes
The packages of regulatory measures tackled
by the Basel Committee on Banking Super-
vision upon a recommendation by the FSF in
response to the subprime crisis also deal with
disclosure aspects. The three papers pub-
lished in July 2009 contain changes to the
Basel II framework, especially in the areas of
securitisation and market risk rules (“en-
hancement project”). One of the outcomes is
a significant extension of disclosure require-
ments for securitisation exposures in the trad-
ing book, the sponsorship of securitisation
vehicles, resecuritisation exposures in the
banking book, market valuation of securitisa-
tion exposures and pipeline and warehousing
risk in connection with securitisation expos-
ures. Another is that, in future, institutions
using internal market price risk models will be
required to disclose the “stress value at risk”,Guidelines for

79“incremental risk charge” and “comprehen-
sive risk measure”.
Two papers – on enhancing the resilience of
the banking industry and on regulating liquid-ity risk (the “resilience project”) – additionallysubmitted for consultation in December 2009as part of a medium-term revision and exten-sion of the Basel supervisory approach like-wise address the topic of disclosure. In future,detailed descriptions of the regulatory capitalto be redefined and of the matching of regu-latory capital with balance sheet capital willbe required. In addition, institutions will alsoneed to disclose the leverage ratio, whichthey will have to additionally calculate, aswell as its components. Moreover, the pro-posals for the regulatory monitoring of liquid-ity risk provide for qualitative and quantitativedisclosures of the short-term liquidity cover-age ratio and the medium-term net stablefunding ratio.
It is additionally becoming apparent that the
compensation rules
14being advocated by the
FSB, especially regarding members of staffwhose activities have a major bearing on abank’s overall risk profile, should also be in-corporated into Pillar 3 in future. At present,the requirements for disclosing compensationto supervisors and other parties with a legit-imate interest are still governed by Pillar 2. Asa result of the global review of the implemen-tation of compensation rules as part of a“Thematic Peer Review on Compensation”,
15
the FSB has suggested that this disclosurerequirement be incorporated into Pillar 3 infuture. This is ultimately expected to giveteeth to the new regulatory measure.The adoption of the multiple Basel activities
in the European Union will proceed in severalstages. In September 2009, the memberstates and the European Parliament ratified adirective amending the Capital RequirementsDirective (CRD),
16which contains inter alia
stricter disclosure requirements for hybridcapital instruments, improvements in marketrisk disclosures and supplemental provisionsfor the disclosure of operational risk. More-over, the Commission’s directive
17containing
technical amendments to the CRD has beenadopted. An additional Commission directivemade technical amendments to the CapitalAdequacy Directive (CAD).
18These three
amending directives are referred to collective-ly as CRD II. Nearing completion is the adop-tion of a further amending directive (CRD III)which addresses the disclosure of risks con-nected with the trading book, securitisationexposures in the trading book and incentive-based remuneration policies. The adoption ofthe Basel resilience project will be followed,lastly, by a further amending directive (CRDIV) which will legislate the EU-wide introduc-
