Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to 
have contracted somewhat in the third quarter 
of 2023.1 Several factors dragged on the Ger -
man economy, such as continued weak foreign 
demand for industrial products. Higher finan -
cing costs also dampened investment. This de -
pressed domestic demand in the industrial sec -
tor and, above all, in construction. Only some 
of this was cushioned by the existing order 
backlog. Output in industry and the main con -
struction sector therefore declined significantly 
in the third quarter. Tailwinds for the German 
economy came from the still robust labour 
market and steep wage increases amidst sub -
siding inflation. However, households were 
probably not yet using their additional scope 
for spending to increase their consumption. 
This is signalled by consumption indicators, 
such as weak real sales in retail and in the hotel 
and restaurant sector. Furthermore, surveys 
conducted by the market research institution 
GfK point to a high propensity to save. The 
weakness of industry and private consumption 
also weighed on many services sectors, as indi -
cated by ifo Institute surveys and the S&P 
Global Purchasing Managers’ Index.
Industry
In August 2023, seasonally adjusted industrial 
output was somewhat higher on the month.2 
Both production in the energy- intensive sectors 
and motor vehicle production contributed to 
this increase. However, averaged over July and 
August, industrial output was down signifi -
cantly on the quarter. Production of motor ve -
hicles saw a particularly steep drop. Figures 
from the German Association of the Automo -
tive Industry on the number of cars manufac -
tured, which are already available up to Sep -tember, also indicate a substantial decline. Ac -
cording to surveys conducted by the ifo Insti -
tute, more than half of firms in the automotive 
industry were still affected by shortages of 
intermediate products recently. At the same 
time, though, the share of firms reporting a 
lack of demand increased. The latter also ap -
plies to industry as a whole. New orders in in -
dustry rose steeply in August in seasonally ad -
justed terms, even when factoring out large 
orders. However, the main factor behind this 
increase was a sharp uptick in orders in the 
electronics sector, which had recently been 
prone to fluctuations. It would therefore be 
premature to state that a turnaround had oc -
curred. Averaged over July and August, the 
downward movement continued, and new 
orders – from both Germany and abroad – fell 
on the quarter in total. This was mainly due to 
significantly lower new orders for capital 
goods. The decline in industrial demand was 
still partially absorbed by high order backlogs, 
but more and more of these are being chipped 
away.
Construction
Construction output declined significantly in 
August 2023 in seasonally adjusted terms. The 
contraction affected both the main construc -
tion sector and the finishing trades. Averaged 
over July and August, however, construction 
output remained virtually unchanged as against 
the previous quarter. Output in the finishing 
trades increased significantly, but decreased 
distinctly in the main construction sector, by 
contrast. The substantially lower demand 
owing to a rise in financing costs and high con -
struction prices is increasingly likely to be felt German eco -

here. Demand for construction work has been 
strongly depressed for some time now – espe -
cially in housing construction. This is particu -
larly evident in the number of building permits, 
which was recently considerably lower than its 
last peak in the first quarter of 2022. New 
orders in the main construction sector in July 
were also well below their last high in the 
fourth quarter of 2021 (by around 11%). How -
ever, order intake was already back up to a 
level significantly higher than its last trough: in 
the first quarter of 2023, orders still lagged be -
hind the level of the fourth quarter of 2021 by 
around 20%. According to ifo Institute surveys, 
firms in the main construction sector are never -
theless increasingly battling with a lack of 
orders and order cancellations. Remaining 
order backlogs are likely to have been a key 
reason why output has stayed relatively robust 
up to now. These continued to provide a buf -
fer. The reach of order books in the main con -
struction sector declined significantly from the 
second quarter of 2022, but was at a higher 
level than its long- term average.
Labour market
As in recent months, the labour market is hav -
ing a stabilising effect on the German econ -
omy. Despite the continued gloominess of 
short- term recruitment plans, employment ac -
tually rose distinctly again in August. In the cur -
rent reporting month, employment increased 
by 35,000 persons compared with July, after 
adjustment for seasonal fluctuations. This 
growth is likely to be concentrated mainly in 
public services sectors, such as health and so -
cial services, education and training, the public 
sector, and energy and water supply. This is, at 
least, what data on employment subject to so -
cial security contributions suggest; however, 
the current data estimates from the Federal 
Employment Agency are available only up to 
July. A less positive picture is painted in sectors 
that are more exposed to cyclical influences, 
such as manufacturing, construction, logistics 
and trade. There was a significant decrease in Stable labour

ment in July, but

the number of employees affected by short-  
time work for economic reasons in July. How -
ever, this is likely to be related to the expiry of 
the last special arrangements to simplify the 
use of short- time work at the end of June. The 
number of registrations for short- time work 
was again higher in September than in the pre -
vious two months. Leading indicators of em -
ployment deteriorated in September. The ifo 
employment barometer dropped into negative 
territory, whereas the corresponding indicator 
of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) 
is still positive despite a slight decline.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, regis -
tered unemployment rose marginally by 10,000 
persons to 2.64 million in September. The un -
employment rate remained at 5.7%. The in -
crease related somewhat more to unemploy -
ment among those receiving insurance benefits 
under the statutory unemployment insurance 
scheme, which predominantly reflects cyclical 
developments. However, unemployment 
among those receiving the basic welfare allow -
ance also went up minimally. Given the weak 
economic situation and strong immigration, 
unemployment is very stable and comparatively 
low. The IAB unemployment barometer deteri -
orated again somewhat in September. Un -
employment is likely to slowly pick up further 
towards the end of the year as well.
Commodity prices
Commodity prices for energy picked up some -
what recently. Crude oil prices went up as a 
result of production cuts in Saudi Arabia and 
Russia as well as supply concerns surrounding 
the conflict in Israel. As this report went to 
press, a barrel of Brent crude oil cost US$94, a 
marked increase from August. Future deliveries 
are being traded at slight discounts in futures 
markets. European gas and electricity prices 
have also risen somewhat since August. This 
was mainly due to the seasonal uptick in global 
gas demand and the emergence of supply con -
cerns related, amongst other things, to the conflict in Israel and the announcement of 
strikes in the Australian gas industry.
Inflation rate
Prices at the upstream stages of the economy 
rose somewhat in August (the latest month for 
which data are available) owing to higher oil 
prices. They had previously been falling since 
the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding en -
ergy, however, the drop in prices continued in 
August, albeit somewhat more weakly than in 
the preceding months. Overall, prices fell even 
more clearly below their prior- year level than in 
July; one reason was that energy prices had 
risen sharply in August 2022. Import prices 
were more than 16% lower than in the previ -
ous year and industrial producer prices were 
down by more than 12%.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) increased in September by a seasonally 
adjusted 0.3% on the month. Energy prices 
rose only marginally even though oil prices had 
gone up markedly in the meantime. This was 
partly due to somewhat cheaper electricity and 
gas tariffs. Food price inflation3 was moderately 
higher. Price growth for industrial goods came 
to a halt for the first time since August 2021. By 
contrast, services prices continued to see above 
average growth. Annual headline HICP inflation 
fell markedly from 6.4% in August to 4.3%, 
mainly owing to one- off effects.4 The core rate 
(excluding energy and food) also dropped con -
siderably, to 4.8%. (August: 6.3%). Around 
1¾  percentage points of the decline in the 
headline rate (core rate: around 1¼ percentage 
points) are attributable to one- off effects, 
which were mainly felt in the energy and ser -
vices sectors. These include base effects stem -
ming from temporary policy measures taken 
last year such as the expiry of the fuel rebate 
and the “€9 ticket” in August 2022, a sharp Barely any rise

increase in the HICP weight for package holi -
days in 2023,5 and generally high energy price 
growth in September 2022, which now damp -
ened the annual rate.
In the coming months, inflation is expected to 
continue to cool a little overall owing to the 
strong rise in energy prices in the second half 
of 2022 and the further gradual easing of price 
rises for food and non- energy goods. However, 
the core rate is likely to remain somewhat 
above 4% in the near term, mainly on account 
of the continued strong growth in services 
prices.
Public finances6
Local government finances
Local government core and off- budget entities 
closed the second quarter with a slight surplus. 
This was €3½ billion lower than in the second 
quarter of the previous year. Revenue and ex -
penditure increased significantly, partly because 
local public transport companies have been re -
corded under the general government sector 
since the second quarter of 2023.7
Revenue rose sharply, by just over 7% (+€6 bil -
lion). This development was driven by the re -
classification of local public transport com -
panies. Revenue from fees climbed consider -
ably, by 27% (+€2½ billion). Growth in the core 
budgets stood at 6½% (+€½ billion). They are 
not affected by the reclassification. Tax revenue 
saw considerably weaker growth than before, 
of 1½% (+€½ billion). Although receipts from 
local business tax – a large revenue item – in -
creased by just under 6% after deducting 
shares accruing to other government levels, 
local government shares in income tax and VAT 
decreased. Transfers from state government 
grew strongly, by 8% (+€2½ billion). Of these, 
investment transfers went up, in particular. 
However, refunds for local government services 
also rose sharply.At 12% (+€9 billion), the rise in total expend -
iture was far greater than the increase in rev -
enue. The statistical reclassification of local 
public transport companies had a significant 
impact here, too (core budget expenditure rose 
by 9½%, or +€7 billion). Fixed asset formation 
saw particularly steep growth (+21%), probably 
due in part to the reclassification, as did other 
operating expenditure and personnel expend -
iture (both +15%). The fact that the inflation 
compensation bonuses from the wage settle -
ment agreed in spring had, to a large extent, 
been paid out to salaried employees in June 
also had a bearing on personnel expenditure. 
Spending on social benefits increased by just 
under 10%, with expenditure on social assis -
tance and assistance for young people seeing 
steep growth. Taken together, accommodation 
costs for recipients of basic allowance benefits 
and benefits for asylum seekers increased by 
3%.8
Local government budgets are set to post a 
deficit for the year as a whole (surplus for 2022 
as a whole: €2½ billion). The budget outcome Inflation likely to 
cool further over

6 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
7 This is related to the recently introduced €49 local public 
transport ticket. Since the second quarter, market revenue 
has no longer been the primary source of income for local 
public transport companies. Statistically speaking, these en -
tities therefore no longer belong to the corporate sector as 
of the second quarter, but to the general government sec -
tor. The revenue and expenditure of local public transport 
companies are increasing growth rates relative to the same 
quarter of the previous year, when these enterprises were 
not yet part of the government sector. It is the off- budget 
entities that are affected, as local public transport com -
panies are now recorded there.
8 In the second quarter of 2022, the benefits to which 
refugees from Ukraine are entitled changed from asylum 
seeker benefits to basic allowance benefits. The accommo -
dation costs for recipients of basic allowance benefits and 
benefits for asylum seekers moved in opposite directions 
accordingly. With regard to the basic allowance, local gov -
ernments bear accommodation costs, three- quarters of 
which are generally reimbursed to them by central govern -
ment. Additional services, such as the provision of meals, 
are paid for by central government in the case of the basic 
allowance (rather than by local governments in the context 
of asylum seeker benefits).Deutsche Bundesbank

already deteriorated substantially in the first 
half of the year, and even with potential relief 
afforded in the second half, a deficit is still likely 
to remain for the year as a whole. The sizeable 
wage agreement and high inflation, in particu -
lar, suggest that expenditure will continue to 
see dynamic growth over the remainder of the 
year.
From the current perspective, an increasing 
deficit for local government appears likely next 
year. Growth in tax revenue could be solid. 
Revenue shortfalls are expected on account of 
the planned Growth Opportunities Act (Wachs -
tumschancengesetz),  amongst other things. 
This will cause both local government and state 
government tax revenue to decrease – a devel -
opment that will, as a rule, affect local govern -
ments via declining general purpose grants 
from state governments. On the expenditure 
side, meanwhile, substantial growth in areas 
such as personnel expenditure is anticipated as 
a result of the wage agreement.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €140.3 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in August 2023 was up on the 
previous month’s figure (€120.5 billion). After 
taking account of redemptions and changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own debt securities, 
the outstanding volume of domestic bonds in -
creased by €11.0 billion, after having increased 
by €27.9 billion in July. Foreign debt securities 
worth €3.7 billion were placed in the German 
market, which meant that the outstanding vol -
ume of domestic and foreign debt instruments 
in Germany went up by €14.7 billion on bal -
ance.
In the month under review, domestic credit in -
stitutions issued debt securities with a net value 
of €10.2 billion, compared with €1.0 billion in 
July. The largest rise was in the outstanding vol -
ume of debt securities issued by specialised credit institutions (€7.8 billion net). Moreover, 
mortgage Pfandbriefe and public Pfandbriefe 
were issued in the amount of €2.5 billion and 
€0.5 billion, respectively. By contrast, the out -
standing volume of other bank debt securities 
that can be structured flexibly fell by €0.5 bil -
lion.
In August, the public sector issued bonds total -
ling €2.4 billion net (July: €27.0 billion). On bal -
ance, only central government increased its 
capital market debt, by €2.8 billion. It issued 
primarily Federal Treasury discount paper (Bu -
bills: €6.0 billion), two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze: €5.0 billion) and five- year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls: €3.7 billion). This contrasted 
with net redemptions of ten- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds) totalling €16.4 billion and a small vol -
ume of 30-  year Federal bonds (Bunds: -€0.8 
billion). State and local governments redeemed 
debt securities with a net value of €0.4 billion.… which is likely

In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
decreased their capital market debt by €1.6 bil -
lion, compared with a reduction of €0.1 billion 
in July. Overall, this was solely attributable to 
other financial intermediaries, which, on bal -
ance, redeemed bonds with a maturity of more 
than one year.
In August, as in the previous month, foreign 
investors were the main buyers. They added a 
net €13.7 billion in German bonds to their port -
folios. Domestic non- banks acquired debt 
securities with a value of €9.5 billion net, with 
foreign and domestic paper attracting the same 
level of interest. Domestic credit institutions 
purchased bonds worth €0.5 billion, all of 
which were German assets. Holdings of bonds 
in the Bundesbank’s portfolio decreased by 
€9.1 billion net.Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
raised fresh capital resources of €1.5 billion by 
placing new shares in the German equity mar -
ket. The volume of foreign shares in the Ger -
man market declined by €1.2 billion over the 
same period. Domestic non- banks dominated 
on the buyers’ side; they added, on balance, 
equities worth €4.3 billion to their portfolios, 
while domestic credit institutions scaled back 
their equity portfolios by €0.9 billion net. For -
eign investors reduced their holdings of Ger -
man equities by €3.1 billion overall.
Mutual funds
In August, domestic mutual funds recorded in -
flows of €4.7 billion. On balance, these funds 
were channelled exclusively into specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors (€4.7 
billion). Of the various asset classes, mixed 
securities- based funds (€3.7 billion), funds of 
funds (€0.9 billion) and open- end real estate 
funds (€0.7 billion) attracted the most invest -
ment. Equity and bond funds redeemed a small 
volume of their own shares to the tune of €0.9 
billion and €0.3 billion, respectively. Foreign 
mutual funds recorded inflows totalling €0.7 
billion in the German market. On balance, do -
mestic non- banks were virtually the only pur -
chasers of mutual fund shares in the reporting 
month (€5.1 billion).
German balance of payments 
in August 2023
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.6 billion in August 2023, down €2.2 bil -
lion on the previous month’s level. While the 
balance in invisible current transactions, which 
comprise services as well as primary and sec -
ondary income, moved into positive territory, 
there was a sharper decline in the surplus in the

The surplus in the goods account decreased by 
€4.9 billion to €14.3 billion. This was due to a 
marked decline in receipts, whereas expend -
iture remained virtually unchanged from the 
previous month.
Invisible current transactions shifted from a def -
icit of €0.5 billion in July back into a surplus, 
which amounted to €2.3 billion. The crucial 
factor here was that net receipts in primary in -
come expanded by €4.0 billion to €17.3 billion. 
This was primarily the result of residents’ higher 
income from their investments in investment 
fund shares. In addition, payments to non-  
residents for income from portfolio investment 
declined. On top of this, the deficit in the sec -
ondary income account fell by €0.8 billion to 
€4.7 billion, mainly off the back of lower gen -
eral government expenditure, including a de -
crease in payments to the EU budget in con -
nection with financing related to gross national 
income. By contrast, the deficit in the services 
account widened by €2.0 billion to €10.3 bil -
lion. Here, receipts recorded an overall decline, 
with receipts from charges for the use of intel -
lectual property and other business services 
falling in particular. Decreases –  especially in 
these areas and lower expenditure on telecom -
munication, computer and information ser -
vices  – also depressed the expenditure side. 
However, the usual seasonal increase in travel 
expenditure played a major role in keeping ex -
penditure practically unchanged overall.
In August, the international financial markets 
were shaped by the anticipated monetary pol -
icy decisions on the part of key central banks at 
their September meetings; at the same time, 
various economic reports influenced the set -
ting. Germany’s cross- border portfolio invest -
ment recorded net capital imports of €7.5 bil -
lion (after €23.7 billion in July), with non-  
resident investors increasing their holdings of 
German securities by €10.7 billion net. On bal -

reduced their direct investment in Germany 
(€0.8 billion). In particular, they scaled back their intra- group lending (€2.3 billion), with re -

additional funds granted via loans. By contrast, 
they stepped up their equity capital in German 
enterprises (€1.5 billion).

Is price competitiveness favourable 
in  Germany and the euro area?
The assessment of an economy’s price competitiveness plays an important role in the economic 
policy debate. International organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund, issue policy 
recommendations based on such evaluations. The Bundesbank also regularly makes reference to 
these in its analyses. The robustness and informative value of price competitiveness indicators 
therefore hold key significance.
One basic indicator of price competitiveness is the real exchange rate, which is composed of the 
nominal exchange rate alongside domestic and foreign inflation rates. High rates of inflation at 
home compared with those abroad as well as nominal effective appreciations of the euro tend 
to adversely affect the price competitiveness of domestic producers. In 2022, a major factor 
weighing on Germany’s price competitiveness was the – at times sharp – relative rise in energy 
prices. To ensure that this is also adequately reflected in an indicator of price competitiveness, a 
suitable price index must be factored into the calculation. The deflator of total sales – which, 
amongst other things, also includes the costs of imported intermediate inputs and the costs of 
energy – proves to be well suited for this purpose.
An indicator based on this price index shows that, in 2022, the price competitiveness of several 
euro area countries against the rest of the euro area saw the largest year- on- year shifts since the 
introduction of the single currency. This is due to the fact that the high rates of inflation last year 
also led to large inflation differentials between the individual countries of the euro area. Depend -
ing on their trade structures, countries with particularly high inflation rates saw their price com -
petitiveness consequently deteriorate markedly, while that of other countries improved distinctly. 
However, Germany’s price competitiveness was hardly impacted by these effects, while the price 
competitiveness of the euro area as a whole was weighed down by relatively high inflation rates 
ceteris paribus.
Alongside the real exchange rate, more refined indicators also take account of other determin -
ants of price competitiveness, particularly the productivity of the domestic economy in relation to 
the economies of other countries. This article presents a new method used by the Bundesbank to 
estimate the price competitiveness of a number of countries based on their relative levels of prod -
uctivity. This method avoids the distortions that are produced by other common estimation pro -
cedures. The analysis shows that, despite the exceptional economic burdens of the past few 
years, Germany and the euro area were in favourable positions with regard to their price com -
petitiveness in 2022 and that their positions improved even further over the course of the year 
due to the sharp nominal effective depreciation of the euro. However, this no longer holds true if 
Germany is compared only to the other countries of the euro area: in this case, Germany’s price 
competitiveness roughly corresponds to the value suggested by its fundamentals. Nevertheless, 
these results should not obscure the fact that the prevailing challenges, such as the persistently 
high energy prices compared with other countries, could negatively impact the price competitive -
ness of both Germany and the euro area.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The issue of a country’s competitiveness is a 
frequent topic in the economic policy debate. 
In this context, “competitiveness” refers to 
whether the businesses in the country as a 
whole –  under fair and free market condi -
tions – are able to compete with vendors from 
other countries. This comprises both price and 
non- price components. This article discusses 
competitiveness with regard to prices, focusing 
on various country- specific price developments, 
relative price developments, and exchange rate 
movements between currency areas. The an -
alysis takes account of the fact that productiv -
ity can grow at different rates in different coun -
tries, which has an impact on the assessment 
of price competitiveness.
Given the period of high inflation since 2021, 
there has been much movement in relative 
price developments among both euro area and 
non- euro area countries. This is because the in -
flation rates in different countries were at dif -
ferent levels and also differed in how they de -
veloped. The nominal exchange rate, which is 
generally the key factor for the short- term de -
velopment of price competitiveness during 
periods of stable prices, thus became less sig -
nificant by comparison. Productivity develop -
ments remained a major explanatory factor 
during the period of high inflation, too.
This article discusses three core questions. First, 
how can price competitiveness be adequately 
measured? Second, what are its special fea -
tures in the current phase of unusually high in -
flation? Third, how much can be explained by 
relative productivity developments? This article 
will primarily analyse the competitiveness of 
Germany and the euro area.A basic indicator of price 
competitiveness for Germany 
and the euro area
How can price competitiveness 
be adequately measured?
The real effective exchange rate is a basic indi -
cator of the price competitiveness of an econ -
omy. Indicators based on the real effective ex -
change rate for the euro area and its Member 
States are calculated by the European Central 
Bank and the Bundesbank according to a com -
mon methodology.1 The indicators calculated 
using this methodology for the euro area are 
referred to as the “real effective exchange rates 
of the euro” and those for the individual Mem -
ber States are referred to as the “harmonised 
competitiveness indicators”.
The calculation of these indicators of price 
competitiveness incorporate trade- weighted 
averages of bilateral nominal exchange rates 
(nominal effective exchange rates) and the 
price or cost ratios between a given country 
and other countries (weighted price differen -
tials). Ultimately, the real effective exchange 
rate thus represents the exchange rate be -
tween a defined basket of goods in a given 
country and the trade- weighted average of its 
partner countries. On this basis, a real depreci -
ation could result either from a nominal effect -
ive depreciation of the euro or from a decline 
in prices at home in relation to abroad. As this 
makes the domestic basket of goods cheaper 
overall in comparison to the foreign basket of 
goods, the price competitiveness of the do -
mestic economy improves.
In order to produce a representative assess -
ment of the price competitiveness of an econ -
omy, an indicator must fulfil – alongside a num -
ber of statistical criteria – the following require -
ments, in particular: it should summarise an Real effective

economy’s price competitiveness against a 
wide range of trading partners, it should reflect 
the price and cost situation as comprehensively 
as possible, and, for purposes of comparison, it 
should extend as far back in time as possible. 
Depending on which of these criteria is at the 
focus, alternative indicators can be calculated 
for a given country to produce different infor -
mation.2
In this article, the real effective exchange rate 
of the euro is calculated against 18 trading 
partners.3 The corresponding indicator of the 
German economy’s price competitiveness com -
prises 37 trading partners – the 18 non- euro 
area trading partners mentioned above as well 
as the 19 remaining euro area countries.
When selecting suitable deflators, there is some 
scope for discretion, as the available price and 
cost indices are defined differently.4 The Euro -
system uses consumer price indices, producer 
price indices, gross domestic product deflators 
(GDP deflators) or unit labour cost indices for 
the total economy.5 In addition, the Bundes -
bank uses the same methodology to calculate 
competitiveness indicators based on deflators 
of total sales. These are at the focus of the 
present analysis and, on a case- by- case basis, 
are compared with indicators based on likewise 
broadly defined GDP deflators.
The difference between deflators of total sales 
and GDP deflators is that the former take ac -
count of the prices of imported goods and ser -
vices, in addition to domestic value added, and 
therefore reflect the price and cost situation to 
an even broader extent than GDP deflators. For 
example, imported intermediate inputs repre -
sent a considerable cost component of domes -
tic production.6 Accordingly, the deflator of 
total sales reflects the average change in the 
prices of both domestically produced and im -
ported goods. Here, it is especially important 
that, unlike the GDP deflator, it also captures 
the influence of international factors – particu -
larly the impact of international trade – on gen -eral price developments, which should be re -
flected in an indicator of price competitiveness.

First, the analysis looks at the real effective ex -
change rates of the euro against 18 trading 
partners calculated on the basis of either GDP 
deflators or deflators of total sales. To illustrate 
the concept of price competitiveness, the real 
exchange rates can be broken down into their 
components: the nominal effective exchange 
rates and the corresponding price differentials Indicator for

2 A comprehensive empirical analysis of the characteristics 
of alternative indicators for price competitiveness is docu -
mented in Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).
3 Croatia’s accession as the 20th member of the euro area 
on 1 January 2023 reduced the number of non- euro area 
trading partners from 19 to 18. The 18 non- euro area trad -
ing partners are Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, 
Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switz -
erland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
4 Empirical evidence suggests that real effective exchange 
rates based on broadly defined price and cost indices have 
relatively high explanatory power for real goods exports 
and are thus suitable indicators of an economy’s price 
competitiveness. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).
5 Consumer price indices exhibit the best data quality and 
comparability between countries, are available in real time, 
and are subject only to minor revisions. However, their 
main disadvantage is that they include neither capital 
goods nor intermediate inputs and thus do not fully cap -
ture the costs of production. By contrast, producer price 
indices include industrial goods and intermediate inputs, 
but do not cover retail trade turnover. The downsides of 
producer price indices, however, are that they do not in -
clude any services prices and that their composition varies 
significantly between countries, which impairs their com -
parability. Unit labour costs for the total economy are quite 
volatile and sometimes subject to considerable data revi -
sions. GDP deflators are broadly defined and, like producer 
price indices, also reflect the costs of production. Further -
more, they also capture the domestic services sector, which 
has grown increasingly significant over recent years. Never -
theless, they are also subject to data revisions and are af -
fected by the volatility of the quarterly GDP data series. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2016), European Central Bank (un -
dated), and Schmitz et al. (2012).
6 One indication of the large and growing significance of 
intermediate inputs for value added in Germany and the 
euro area is provided by the considerable increase in the 
share of intermediate inputs in the total volume of trade, 
which saw particularly strong growth relative to total im -
ports. In 2021, this share averaged more than 50% across 
all euro area Member States. By contrast, the average 
shares of imported capital and consumer goods were sig -
nificantly lower at around one-  fifth each. See Eurostat 
(2022).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

(see the chart above). Initially, it should be 
noted that both of these indicators of euro 
area price competitiveness are highly correlated 
with one another. This is due mainly to the fact 
that these indicators are largely determined by 
the nominal effective exchange rate and that, 
in historical terms, the deflators exhibit com -
paratively minor variation over the short term. 
For example, between the final quarter of 2020 
and the third quarter of 2022, the euro depre -
ciated by around 7% against the partner cur -
rencies and has since recovered more than half 
of these losses. Here, the largest contributions 
to the nominal effective depreciation of the 
euro came from marked losses in value against the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Chi -
nese renminbi.
In light of the generally strong correlation be -
tween the two real effective exchange rates of 
the euro – based on deflators of total sales and 
GDP deflators, respectively – it is noteworthy 
that the two figures have increasingly been di -
verging from one another since 2021. The as -
sessments of how price competitiveness in the 
euro area has changed therefore vary accord -
ingly. For example, since 2021, the indicator 
based on GDP deflators has suggested a per -
ceptibly stronger real effective depreciation of 
the euro and thus a greater improvement in Weighted price

price competitiveness than the indicator based 
on deflators of total sales. As the nominal ef -
fective exchange rate developments are the 
same for both indicators, this increasing dis -
crepancy is a reflection of the differences in the 
deflators over time.
For instance, the weighted price differentials 
based on these deflators have shown a striking 
trend by historical standards since 2021. While 
the weighted price differentials based on GDP 
deflators are characterised by a decline in do -
mestic prices compared to those in other coun -
tries and a subsequent relative increase in 
prices up to the end of 2022, the weighted 
price differentials based on deflators of total 
sales indicate a continuous rise in relative prices 
vis- à- vis other countries since the second half 
of 2021. The latter is reflected in a less pro -
nounced real decline in the corresponding indi -
cator of price competitiveness.
The relative price developments in imported 
intermediate inputs since 2021 are, indeed, 
probably the main factor for the growing dis -
crepancy between the series of price differen -
tials based on the various deflators. This is be -
cause a marked increase in energy prices was 
observed from April 2021 to September 2022; 
this rise was considerably more pronounced in 
the euro area than other regions of the world 
due to the euro area’s strong dependence on 
imports of natural gas from Russia.7 Since that 
time, energy prices in the euro area have 
abated again in relation to those in other coun -
tries. As this has a direct impact on the indica -
tor based on deflators of total sales (and the 
corresponding price differentials), but not on 
the indicator based on GDP deflators, the for -
mer indicator suggests a distinctly less favour -
able trend for euro area price competitiveness 
up until September 2022.8 By contrast, the in -
dicator based on GDP deflators does not pro -
vide a complete picture of price competitive -
ness during this period. This suggests that, at 
least for the past few years, an indicator based 
on the deflators of total sales would be prefer -
able to one based on GDP deflators. For that reason, this analysis will focus on indicators of 
price competitiveness that were calculated 
using deflators of total sales.
How can the price competi -
tiveness of the euro area be 
evaluated?
The analysis has thus far looked at changes in 
the price competitiveness of the euro area over 
time. In order to reach a conclusion about the 
level of the indicator as well – i.e. whether the 
price competitiveness position of the euro area 
can be assessed as favourable or unfavour -
able – the indicator must be put in relation to a 
benchmark value that reflects the equilibrium 
(i.e. neutral) level of the real exchange rate. The 
price competitiveness position would be 
deemed to be favourable, for example, if the 
value of the indicator were considerably below 
a reference value defined in this way.
The equilibrium level of the real exchange rate 
is a long- term concept that must be derived 
from economic theory. Relative purchasing 
power parity theory, amongst others, can be 
drawn upon for this purpose.9 This theory 
states that the indicator – in this case, the rela -
tive price of a basket of goods in a given coun -
try compared to that in other countries ex -
pressed in a common currency  – should be 
constant over the long term. According to the 
theory, this holds true because the changes in 
the nominal exchange rate compensate for 
international differences in inflation rates over 
time due to arbitrage. Consequently, the long- The important

8 Evidence suggests that, in particular, imports of inter -
mediate inputs from countries that are less dependent on 
global energy production have temporarily replaced pro -
duction in the more energy- intensive segments of the euro 
area manufacturing sector in some cases; see Chiacchio et 
al. (2023). However, since this development is reflected by 
the indicators of price competitiveness based on deflators 
of total sales but not those based on GDP deflators, the 
latter present a distorted picture of price competitiveness in 
the euro area.

determining the equilibrium level of the real exchange rate

term average of the indicator reflects the equi -
librium level of the real exchange rate and can 
thus be used as a benchmark value.10 Due to its 
simplicity, this method is frequently used to ob -
tain an initial assessment of an economy’s price 
competitiveness position.
If this long- term average of the real effective 
exchange rate is calculated based on deflators 
of total sales, the euro area’s current competi -
tiveness position is favourable overall. This has 
been the case for some time now, including for 
indicators based on GDP deflators. However, 
caution should be exercised when interpreting 
the euro area’s competitiveness position, as the 
corresponding averages, such as those for the 
indicator based on deflators of total sales, are 
only available as of 1997.11 In addition, the indi -
cator for the euro area includes a non- negligible 
share of emerging market economies among 
the trading partners.12 A comparison of the 
levels of these indicators with the respective 
series averages is therefore less meaningful 
than in the case of Germany, for example, 
where the indicators are available from 1975 
onwards.
Indicators of Germany’s price 
competitiveness
For Germany, two indicators of price competi -
tiveness based on deflators of total sales are 
considered (see the chart on p. 19): one against 
a group of 37 trading partners – corresponding 
to the indicator for the euro area  – and the 
other against a smaller group of 27 trading 
partners. The latter excludes, amongst others, 
the central and eastern European countries and 
emerging market economies. This sub- indicator 
is useful because economic catching- up pro -
cesses in the excluded countries are usually ac -
companied by higher inflation rates even if 
competitiveness remains unchanged, which 
distorts interpretations when measured against 
the benchmark. Overall, however, both indica -
tors are highly correlated. Measured by the 
long- term average, the indicators have been signalling a favourable price competitiveness 
position for the German economy for some 
time.13
Germany’s current competitiveness position re -
mains favourable in terms of the simple meas -
ure of long- term averages, even where a dis -
tinction is made between euro area partner 
countries and those outside the euro area. A 
comparison between the overall indicator 
against 27 countries and the sub- indicator 
against only the non- euro area partner coun -
tries in said 27 countries shows that the sub-  
indicator is markedly more volatile. It suggests 
that Germany’s price competitiveness against 
partner countries outside the euro area is cur -
rently comparable to its position against all 
partner countries.
The sub- indicator against euro area partner 
countries also points to a favourable competi -
tiveness position in Germany when measured 
against its long- term average. This has been 
the case since as early as 2002.14 In addition, 
this sub- indicator is significantly less volatile 
than the indicator against non- euro area part -
ner countries or the overall indicator. This is be -
cause the single currency means that no nom -
inal exchange rate fluctuations between Ger -
many and the other euro area countries are 
transmitted to the price competitiveness indica -Indicator points

11 Prior to the introduction of the euro in 1999, changes in 
the previous currencies of the eleven original euro area 
Member States are converted into hypothetical euro ex -
change rates using the irrevocably fixed euro exchange 
rates. The aggregation of these exchange rates is based on 
the shares of manufacturing trade in these countries out of 
total euro area foreign trade with non- euro area countries. 
See Schmitz et al. (2012).
12 The underlying problem is explained on p. 23 and p. 26.
13 For the German economy, the indicator of price com -
petitiveness based on deflators of total sales against 27 
trading partners is already available from the beginning of 
the 1960s. However, in order to exclude from the analysis 
the turbulence during the transition from the Bretton 
Woods system of fixed exchange rates to flexible exchange 
rates, only the period from 1975 onwards is actually used.
14 However, if additional information on relative price and 
productivity levels is taken into account, Germany’s price 
competitiveness position compared with its euro area part -
ner countries should not be regarded as favourable, but 
instead neutral. See p. 29.Deutsche Bundesbank

tor. Instead, this sub- indicator represents the 
weighted price differential against euro area 
partner countries, in which case only relative 
prices can provide for any necessary adjust -
ment processes, which is usually a lengthy pro -
cess owing to price stickiness. Accordingly, al -
though Germany’s relative prices have tended 
to rise slowly over the past decade compared 
with the rest of the euro area, the impact on its 
competitiveness position has remained rather 
small.Impact of inflation differen -

such as the response of fiscal and labour mar -
ket policy to the pandemic- induced economic 
downturn in spring 2020 and the pace of Euro -
system monetary policy normalisation in 2022 
also played a role.15
Euro area inflation as measured by the Har -
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) 
reached a historical peak in 2022 at 8.4% on 
the year. Such a figure is all the more striking as 
in previous years it had stood at 0.3% (2020) 
and 2.6% (2021). The same applies to the an -
nual rate of change in the deflator of total 
sales, which is more relevant for price competi -
tiveness. This likewise stood at 0.3% in 2020, 
rose to 4.1% in 2021, and reached its all- time 
high of 9.0% in 2022.
The extraordinary inflation developments in the 
euro area in recent years have been accompan -
ied by above- average inflation differentials be -
tween euro area Member States, particularly in 
2022. Whilst annual HICP rates in 2020 ranged 
from -1.3% in Greece to 2.0% in Slovakia, they 
were positive for all countries in 2021, with the 
highest annual HICP rate being 4.6% in Lithu -
ania. Measured by the deflator of total sales, 
inflation rates in 2020 ranged between -2.7% 
in Greece and 1.8% in France. In 2021, they 
rose in all countries, with the highest inflation 
rate being 8.3% in Lithuania. In 2022, inflation 
rates in all euro area Member States reached 
their highest levels since the introduction of the 
euro, with the exception of Slovakia (as meas -
ured by the HICP) and Ireland (as measured by 
the deflator of total sales). The Baltic states re -
corded the highest annual rates of change in 
terms of both the HICP and the deflator of total 
sales, which were above 15% in all cases and, 
in the extreme cases of Estonia and Lithuania, 
were at 19.4% (HICP) and 21.4% (deflator of 
total sales), respectively.16 This contrasts with 
comparatively low values of 5.9% in France 
(HICP) and 4.5% in Ireland (deflator of total 
sales).
The deviation of the national inflation rate of 
an individual euro area Member State from that of the euro area provides an indication of the 
impact of such inflation differentials on the 
price competitiveness of that country com -
pared with the rest of the euro area, especially 
where the deflator of total sales is used.17 The 
chart on p. 21 shows these deviations for all 
euro area countries calculated on the basis of 
the HICP and the deflator of total sales for 
2020, 2021 and 2022.18 For a country with in -
flation above the euro area average, a white 
dot indicates the average level of positive devi -
ations from current inflation in the euro area in 
the years following the introduction of the 
euro in that country until 2019. If, by contrast, 
a country’s deviation from euro area inflation 
for the current year is negative (blue bar point -
ing to the left), the years in the aforementioned 
period during which deviations from current in -
flation in the euro area were negative are used 
to find the average level of negative deviation 
(black dot). For example, if the national infla -
tion rate is higher than that of the euro area 
and also significantly higher than the value in -
dicated by the dot, the inflation rate for that 
country is exceptionally high.
The chart shows that, in 2020, the deviations 
of national inflation rates from those in the 
euro area were unremarkable, regardless of 
whether the HICP or the deflator of total sales 
is considered. Some countries had lower or 
somewhat higher deviations than in previous … reaching a

16 Energy prices were a key factor in the sharp rise in infla -
tion in the Baltic states. Before the war in Ukraine, these 
were lower in the Baltic states than for the other euro area 
countries on average. However, the percentage increase in 
energy prices as a result of the war was much higher in 
those countries. Differences in applicable energy price 
regulations, the energy mix and the support measures for 
households and firms initiated by euro area governments 
to cushion high prices also led to the observed inflation 
rate differentials. See Müller (2023) and European Central 
Bank (2023).
17 However, an exact value of the change in price com -
petitiveness cannot be derived from such a metric. First, it 
does not take into account the fact that the weights of the 
partner countries differ for each base country, and, second, 
the inflation rates for the euro area also include develop -
ments in the base country.
18 Similar observations were also made for the HICP ex -
cluding administered prices, the HICP excluding energy and 
food, and the HICP at constant tax rates, none of which 
produced a fundamentally different picture.Deutsche Bundesbank

years. This changed fundamentally in 2021 and 
especially in 2022. For the HICP , in 2022 the 
deviations of national inflation rates from that 
of the euro area were many times higher for 
eight out of 19 countries than the average 
value in previous years. With regard to the de -
flator of total sales, which is more relevant for 
price competitiveness, the picture is even more 
striking. In this case, the deviations from 14 of 
the 19 euro area countries were at least twice 
as high as the average value in previous years.
This finding illustrates that the price competi -
tiveness of most countries compared with the 
rest of the euro area changed considerably 
more severely in 2022 than had been observed 
so far in any year since they joined the euro 
area. France, Austria and Cyprus were among 
the countries with far below- average inflation 
and thus experienced a marked improvement 
in price competitiveness. Italy, too, was able to 
post marked gains in price competitiveness 
compared with the other euro area countries in 
2022 owing to low inflation rates. The Baltic 
countries, Belgium, the Netherlands and Slo -
venia featured among those countries with far 
above- average inflation and thus experienced a 
marked deterioration in price competitiveness.
These developments are also noteworthy in 
that relative price changes have traditionally 
only been able to significantly influence the 
price competitiveness of euro area and other 
advanced economies cumulatively over many 
years. In a year- on- year perspective, it was usu -
ally the nominal effective exchange rate that 
caused any marked changes in price competi -
tiveness. This statement can be illustrated by 
the fact that the annual rate of change of the 
indicator of Germany’s price competitiveness 
was largely determined by the movements of 
the sub- indicator against partner countries out -
side the euro area, in which the exchange rate 
component plays a major role – and not by the 
sub- indicator against partner countries within 
the euro area, which is driven only by the price 
component (see the chart on p. 19). In 2022, 
by contrast, this was fundamentally different for a number of euro area countries with par -
ticularly strong or comparatively weak inflation 
dynamics. The considerable price differential in 
these countries led to severe shifts in price 
competitiveness within a short period of time 
and considerably weighed on or benefited pro -
ducers competing internationally.
Remarkably, Germany, of all countries, was not 
affected by a severe shift in its price competi -
tiveness. Germany is indeed one of the few 
euro area countries where the inflation differ -
ential against the euro area as a whole was 
very small, not only in 2020 and 2021, but also 
in 2022. On balance, the weighted price differ -
ential between the German economy and 
those of euro area partner countries deterior -
ated only slightly in 2020 and 2021, and re -
mained unchanged in 2022 (see the chart on 
p. 19). Thus, Germany’s price competitiveness 
against this group of countries was not signifi -
cantly influenced by relative price develop -
ments. Rather, in 2022 – in line with historical 
trends – the marked nominal effective depreci -
ation of the euro against 18 partner currencies 
dominated the movements of the indicator. 
This depreciation led to an improvement in 
Germany’s price competitiveness compared 
with the other countries. As a result, when dis -
cussing the impact of energy price increases or, 
more generally, high inflation on Germany’s 
price competitiveness (see pp. 24 f.), it should 
be borne in mind that these developments 
have put a far greater strain on the macroeco -
nomic price competitiveness of some other 
euro area countries in recent years.

ing power parity theory can only provide a 
starting point. For example, relative purchasing 
power parity theory, from which the long- term 
average of a real exchange rate is derived as a 
benchmark, assumes that this benchmark is 
constant. Theories with less simplistic model 
assumptions, however, suggest that the equi -
librium value of the real exchange rate, too, is 
not constant, but instead depends on funda -
mental factors, especially on relative productiv -
ity trends of the economy under consider -
ation.19 For this reason, a benchmark based on 
long- term averages is only appropriate for 
homogeneous groups of countries with similar 
productivity trends. For example, only ad -
vanced economies are taken into account as 
trading partners when calculating Germany’s 
price competitiveness position using this 
method (see p.  18). Restricting the group of 
partner countries to a homogeneous group of 
countries increases the robustness of the re -
sults, but limits their representativeness.
In light of the great importance of emerging 
market economies and transition countries for 
foreign trade in Germany and the euro area, 
the Bundesbank has for some time now been 
using the productivity approach to determine 
the price competitiveness position of many 
economies.20 By taking into account the impact 
of relative productivity on an economy’s real ef -
fective exchange rate, this approach allows the 
price competitiveness of advanced economies 
to be correlated with emerging market econ -
omies and transition countries. For example, it 
takes into account the fact that the economic 
catching- up processes in emerging market 
economies and transition countries associated 
with strong productivity increases are usually 
accompanied by higher inflation rates, which 
lead to a real appreciation without seriously 
altering those countries’ competitiveness pos -
itions. If this mechanism were not taken into 
account, the real appreciation would incor -
rectly be reflected in the assessment as a de -
terioration in price competitiveness.In addition, theoretical considerations and em -
pirical results alike suggest that level data play 
a key role in the relationship between product -
ivity and the real exchange rate. Therefore, it is 
important to take into account not only the ex -
tent to which a relative increase in productivity 
in a given country leads to a real (equilibrium) 
appreciation in that country, but also the extent 
to which a higher relative productivity level is 
accompanied by a higher relative (equilibrium) 
price level in that country. Based on this meas -
ure, the productivity approach, which adjusts 
the real exchange rate for such productivity ef -
fects in the form of the relative price level, rep -
resents a more robust equilibrium concept for 
assessing price competitiveness. The resulting 
benchmark reflects the expected relative price 
level based on the given relative productivity 
level. If the actual relative price level falls below 
this benchmark, the price competitiveness pos -
ition is deemed to be favourable.
The Bundesbank’s productivity approach allows 
price competitiveness to be determined in a 
consistent manner for a broad, representative 
group of economies. To allow real exchange 
rates to be used in the form of relative price 
levels rather than merely as indices, a different 
body of data is used than in earlier sections of 
this article. Relative price levels are calculated 
using purchasing power parities. Purchasing 
power parity expresses the domestic value of a 
broad basket of goods costing a fixed US dollar 
amount in the United States in the respective 
local currency of each economy under observa -
tion. The prices of the respective goods and 
services contained in the basket of goods are 
recorded by national statistical offices accord -Valuation of

Samuelson effect; see pp. 27 f.. Other frequently cited de -
terminants of real equilibrium exchange rates include, for 
example, the net external position and relative government 
expenditure. However, evidence suggests that the addition 
of further determinants – on top of relative productivity 
trends – does not significantly improve the adequate calcu -
lation of the benchmark. See Deutsche Bundesbank

Energy prices and price competitiveness of the German 
economy – recent developments
Given the persistently high energy prices, ques-
tions arise concerning the extent to which they 
have weakened Germany’s international price 
competitiveness and infl  uenced decisions made 
by affected enterprises as to where to locate. 
When it comes to analysing the impact of fac-
tors such as the energy crisis on Germany’s price 
competitiveness, the indicator based on defl  a-
tors of total sales, which also contains the costs 
of imported intermediate inputs such as those 
for energy, is particularly well suited.1 Judged by 
this indicator, the price competitiveness of Ger-
many’s economy relative to selected advanced 
economies improved by 2.1% between the fi  rst 
quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2022, 
but subsequently deteriorated by 2.7%.2
It has already been shown previously that at the 
exact period that Germany’s price competitive-
ness underwent a marked improvement be-
tween January 2022 and September 2022, the 
relative energy price in Germany had actually risen sharply by just under 30% compared with 
other advanced economies.3 This weighed down 
the German economy’s price competitiveness by 
0.9% over the period in question ceteris paribus, 
according to a rough calculation made by the 
Bundesbank at the time. At the same time, how-
ever, the euro depreciated against the US dollar, 
which, all else being equal, improved price com-
petitiveness by an estimated 1.9%. As a result, 
the negative relative price effect was more than 
offset by the positive exchange rate effect, 
meaning that Germany’s price competitiveness 
improved during this period.
Between October 2022 and July 2023 (after 
which no more data are currently available) 
however, the mirror image of these develop-
ments set in. During this period, Germany’s rela-
tive energy costs fell by 22.1% and the euro ap-
preciated against the US dollar by 11.7%. Work-
ing under the same assumptions as were used 
for the rough calculation mentioned earlier,4 the 
decline in relative energy costs, all else un-
changed, translates into a 0.4% improvement in 
Germany’s price competitiveness and the appre-
ciation of the euro produces a deterioration of 
1.7%.
Taking into account developments in 2021, 
which were particularly characterised by the 
relative rise in energy prices occasioned by short-
ages in Russian gas supplies, we are left with an 
increase in Germany’s relative energy prices of 
5.0% over the entire period from the start of 
2021 to July 2023. As a result, Germany’s price 
competitiveness deteriorated by 0.2%. This was 
offset by an improvement of around 1.4% stem-
ming from the euro’s depreciation against the 
1 See p. 17.
2 The indicator employed here covers 27 trading part-
ners. This is because the rough calculation used to 
measure relative energy costs for the purposes of our 
analysis is based on an energy- specifi  c producer price 
index that is unavailable for many countries.
3 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022b). The article fo-
cuses on the relative increase in energy prices in 2022 
in relation to Russia’s war of aggression against 
Ukraine.
4 Specifi  cally, we assume an energy cost share of just 
over 2% for the German economy as a whole and as-
sign the United States a trade weight of 15% for Ger-
many.Components of Germany's price

US dollar, which meant that, according to our 
calculations, the negative cost effect was more 
than absorbed when looking at the economy as 
a whole.
There is currently talk of a “bridge” electricity 
price. Subsidies of this kind would risk slowing 
down structural change, making such an ar-
rangement unconducive to the transition to 
greener energy.5 Nevertheless, an illustration of 
the – limited – effect that such a measure would 
have on price competitiveness in aggregate 
terms has been provided here. The following 
estimation is based on the proposal put forward 
by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and 
Climate Action in spring 2023. The proposal sug-
gests introducing a temporary cap on electricity 
prices for a certain set of energy- intensive fi  rms 
for a transition period that would run up to 
2030, according to the plans of the Federal Min-
istry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.6 
The proposed bridge pricing of 6 cent (for the 
net “Arbeitspreis”, or working price) per kilowatt 
hour would be well below the benchmark price 
of the current temporary electricity price brake 
of 13 cent (net working price) per kilowatt hour. 
Taking into account the relevant taxes and levies, 
the bridge electricity price would reduce the 
benefi  ciary companies’ electricity costs by 
roughly 35%, compared to their bills under cur-
rent regulations.7 As electricity costs account for 
around 0.7% of total production costs on aggre-
gate, the electricity subsidy would improve price 
competitiveness by an estimated 0.3% on the 
basis of the indicator considered.8
Overall, even without the bolstering effect of 
euro depreciation and further subsidies, the rela-
tive cost effect of high energy prices on the price 
competitiveness of the German economy ap-
pears to have been negligibly small of late. 
Nevertheless, when talking about indicators of 
price competitiveness, it should be borne in 
mind that we are dealing with a macroeconomic 
concept. Sectors with a higher share of energy 
costs than the average for the economy as a 
whole will be hit commensurately harder by a 
relative increase in energy prices in Germany. Ex-
amples include products from the chemical and 
paper industries, whose energy cost shares 
amount to an estimated 13% and 18%, respect-
ively, according to input- output tables. The bur-
dens arising from the relative increase in energy 
prices experienced by Germany are thus many 
times greater in those two sectors than they are 
for the economy at large.Furthermore, energy costs in Germany have risen 
signifi  cantly over the period under review when 
compared against the energy costs of specifi  c 
competitors. All other things being equal, then, 
incentives to invest in energy- intensive industrial 
plants in countries with comparatively low en-
ergy costs are likely to have grown. Productivity 
gains in Germany could act as a counterweight 
to such developments. Improvements to the 
framework conditions in Germany, with the goal 
– among other things – of fostering effi   ciency 
gains and securing the energy supply, would 
help here.9 This would serve to support Germa-
ny’s price competitiveness, which still remains in 
favourable shape overall.

6 Specifi  cally, the idea is that in years in which the 
average market price for electricity has been higher 
than 6 cent per kilowatt hour, certain energy-intensive 
fi  rms will be reimbursed for the difference for 80% of 
their energy consumption. See Federal Ministry for 
Economic Affairs and Climate Action (2023).
7 According to data from the Federal Statistical Offi   ce, 
taxes and levies on electricity for non- households with 
somewhat higher consumption amounted to 7 cent 
per kilowatt hour in the fi  rst half of 2023. These must 
be added as additional electricity costs to the current 
electricity price brake and the proposed bridge electri-
city price. In purely arithmetical terms, the 7 cent per 
kilowatt hour mark- up results in a maximum limit for 
the working price including taxes and levies of 20 cent 
per kilowatt hour at present. Under the proposal sub-
mitted by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and 
Climate Action, the corresponding price for electricity 
would work out at 13 cent per kilowatt hour, meaning 
that the electricity price would fall by 35% compared 
with current provisions as a result of the measure. For 
more information on the data source, see Federal Stat-
istical Offi   ce (2023).
8 According to data from the Federal Statistical Offi   ce 
on the calculation of producer prices for industrial 
products, electricity accounts for around one- third of 
producer prices for energy, meaning that Germany’s 
relative producer prices for energy would fall by 
around 12% compared with its partner countries. As-
suming that energy costs account for around 2% of 
total costs, as mentioned above, Germany’s price com-
petitiveness would improve by roughly 0.26%. For 
more on what proportion of producer prices for en-
ergy is accounted for by electricity, see Federal Statis-
tical Offi   ce (2022).

ing to a uniform methodology.21 That country’s 
purchasing power parity is then measured at its 
currency’s nominal exchange rate against the 
US dollar. This results in the relative price level, 
i.e. a real exchange rate at (relative) levels, 
which is then compared with a relative level of 
productivity. Productivity per hour worked (in 
purchasing power parities) is generally the pre -
ferred measure of the productivity level be -
cause it is arguably the closest proxy for total 
factor productivity.22
Two variables, then, are key to assessing price 
competitiveness using the productivity ap -
proach: hourly productivity and relative price 
levels. The following section shows, for illustra -
tive purposes, how these two variables evolved 
for the largest economies, i.e. the United 
States, China, Japan, Germany and the euro 
area, between 1999 and 2022. Hourly product -
ivity has been influenced by exceptional global 
factors, particularly in recent years, with both 
GDP and hours worked dropping markedly for 
a time in 2020 when the coronavirus spread 
across the countries under analysis. Germany 
was recording the highest level of hourly prod -
uctivity prior to the global financial crisis of 
2008-09, but the United States has since closed 
the gap. Hourly productivity in the euro area 
moved in a similar fashion to Germany’s, but at 
a lower level. The past two years have seen this 
gap between German and euro area hourly 
productivity widen somewhat because euro 
area real GDP (measured in International Dol -
lars) grew more slowly than hours worked in 
2021 and 2022, which lowered labour product -
ivity. Hourly productivity in Japan was signifi -
cantly lower than in Germany and the euro 
area throughout the period under analysis, 
reaching just under two- thirds of the German 
level in 2022. China has experienced very dy -
namic growth since the global financial crisis in 
particular, and yet its hourly productivity level 
still lags significantly behind that of the other 
countries under analysis, coming in at around 
20% of Germany’s.The highest relative price level between 1999 
and 2015 was mostly to be found in Japan, 
even if the country’s hourly productivity was 
comparatively low. Since then, however, the 
relative price level in the United States has been 
higher, which is consistent with that country 
recording the highest level of hourly productiv -
ity (alongside Germany).23 The price levels of 
Germany and the euro area overlap with a 
small number of exceptions. Compared with 
the United States, Germany and the euro area 
experienced a real depreciation last year, with 
the relative price level in Germany coming in 
around 24%, and the relative price level in the 
euro area coming in around 28%, below that 
of the United States. Just as China has the low -
est relative hourly productivity, so, too, is its 
relative price level the lowest. That said, China’s 
real exchange rate against the euro area, much 
like that of the United States, has seen a 
marked real appreciation since 2015, visibly 
narrowing the price-  level gap to other coun -
tries. For instance, the gap between China’s 
price level and that of the United States has 
roughly halved since 1999, reaching just under 
60% of the US price level, around 79% of Ger -
many’s price level and 83% of the euro area’s 
price level in 2022. These percentages show 
that the stark differences in hourly productivity 
between the countries under analysis are re -
flected to a far lesser extent in relative price 
levels in 2022, with the exception of the United 
States.

price levels and hourly productivity  – can be

22 See Fischer and Hossfeld (2014). An alternative measure 
used in some emerging market economies if hourly prod -
uctivity data are not available is per- employee productivity 
(again in purchasing power parities).
23 The surging real appreciation observed in the United 
States in 2015 is due primarily to a significant and broadly 
based nominal depreciation of the euro and also to a nom -
inal appreciation of the US dollar. It should also be borne in 
mind for the next section of this article that relative price 
levels are real exchange rates, meaning that they are partly 
driven by changes in nominal exchange rates, significantly 
so in some cases.Deutsche Bundesbank

How to assess price competitiveness using productivity 
approach- based indicators
Economic theories may serve as a basis for 
deriving empirical benchmarks –  namely 
equilibrium real exchange rates – that en-
able statements to be formulated on a na-
tional economy’s price competitiveness. In 
relation to these benchmarks, a country’s 
price competitiveness may be assessed as 
favourable or unfavourable. At the Bundes-
bank, the benchmarks are determined inter 
alia based on the productivity approach, 
which takes account of the differences in 
productivity between the countries in ques-
tion.
A theoretical foundation for a benchmark 
based on the productivity approach is pro-
vided by the Balassa- Samuelson hypoth-
esis.1 According to this hypothesis, the rela-
tive price level of two national economies is 
determined by the different productivity 
levels of those countries in the traded and 
non- traded goods sectors. Using plausible 
assumptions, the statements can be applied 
to economy- wide productivities.2 Hence, a 
positive relationship exists between the 
relative productivity of a country and its real 
exchange rate in the form of the relative 
price level. Accordingly, the benchmark for 
the relative price level of the country in 
question rises in line with its productivity 
relative to its partner countries (Balassa- 
Samuelson effect). The following mechan-
ism is behind this: countries with a com-
paratively high productivity level pay com-
paratively high wages in the traded goods 
sector, without this impairing their price 
competitiveness. However, these relatively 
high wages are also paid in the non- traded 
goods sector because both sectors com-
pete for labour. The higher wages are thus 
responsible for the comparatively high price 
level in the more productive national econ-omy.3 Because the productivity approach- 
based benchmarks take relative productivity 
levels into account, they can also express 
the price competitiveness of advanced 
economies relative to that of emerging 
market economies, which is not possible 
when long- term averages are used.
Price competitiveness indicators based on 
the productivity approach are calculated in 
three steps at the Bundesbank. In a fi  rst 
step, the Balassa- Samuelson effect is deter-
mined based on the assumption that the 
strength of the effect is uniform across all 
of the countries under analysis. In empirical 
terms, the strength of the effect is deter-
mined using a country panel regression ap-
proach in which the respective relative price 
level of a country is placed in a linear rela-
tionship to its relative productivity level. To 
ensure that the series are comparable with 
one another, the relative price and relative 
productivity levels of each country are in-
cluded in the estimate as bilateral ratios 
standardised to a uniform base country.4 In 
order to avoid interpretation diffi   culties, the 
base country is not part of the group of 
countries under analysis, seeing as no indi-
cator of price competitiveness can be calcu-
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2013a).
2 Evidence of the theoretical and empirical validity of 
this relationship is presented in Fischer and Hossfeld 
(2014), for example. This applies both to the Balassa- 
Samuelson hypothesis as well as to the Balassa- 
Samuelson effect mentioned later in this paragraph. 
Macroeconomic instead of sectoral relative productiv-
ities are frequently used within the scope of empirical 
work on the Balassa- Samuelson effect. The empirically, 
regularly determined positive relationship between the 
relative macroeconomic productivity level and the rela-
tive macroeconomic price level is often also referred 
to  as the “Penn effect”; see Bergstrand (1991) and 
Samuel son (1994).

lated for the base country. In the process, 
the productivity level is approximated by la-
bour productivity per hour worked and the 
price level is calculated by means of pur-
chasing power parities.5
As part of the second step, country- specifi  c 
effective multilateral benchmarks, i.e. val-
ues relating to a large group of 56 partner 
countries in each case, are calculated to de-
termine neutral price competitiveness.6 It is 
therefore determined which price level of a 
country is to be classifi  ed as neutral when 
taking account of the productivity of the 
relevant country along with the productivity 
and price levels of its trading partners and 
the strength of the Balassa- Samuelson ef-
fect. To this end, trade- weighted measures 
are calculated for each country as regards 
the relative price and productivity levels, 
with the trade weights used here matching 
those also used to calculate the effective 
exchange rates. Its trade- weighted equilib-
rium relative price level is then obtained 
from its relative productivity level multiplied 
by the estimated elasticity calculated uni-
formly across countries as part of the fi  rst 
step.
In the third step, a two- stage forecast 
method is used to calculate the daily cur-
rent deviation from the benchmark. This is 
necessary because the annual frequency of 
the price and productivity levels used in the 
fi  rst step of the approach and their lagged 
publication mean that the fi  nal data point 
of the observation period is not current; at 
present, for example, it refers to the year 
2022. To render the approach usable for 
economic policy purposes, a current fore-
cast value is necessary. For this purpose, a 
quarterly forecast is fi  rst prepared using the 
productivity differential of the country 
under analysis in relation to its trading part-
ners as well as the real effective exchange 
rate based on consumer price indices.7 Next, a daily current value is forecast with 
the aid of the nominal effective exchange 
rate. Given this comparatively short period 
frequently amounting to merely a few 
months, it is assumed, for the sake of sim-
plicity, that the relative productivity level is 
constant and that the infl  ation differential 
in relation to the trading partners is equal to 
zero.8
5 In individual cases where the time series for hourly 
productivity is not available, an alternative option is to 
use an estimate of labour productivity per employee 
for the country under analysis.
6 While the broad group of countries uniformly deter-
mined in the Eurosystem comprises a total of 60 trad-
ing partners – see this report, Statistical Section, Table 
XII.11 – only the data records for 56 of these countries 
are used in our calculations. As already mentioned, Co-
lombia serves as the base country in our analyses and 
therefore does not belong to the group of partner 
countries. In addition, Ukraine is not considered any 
longer due to its recent problematic data status. More-
over, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are 
not included in our calculations either, since oil and 
gas production constitutes a key fundamental factor of 
macroeconomic development in these countries. How-
ever, as prices of such homogeneous goods are deter-
mined on the world market, the assessment of the 
price competitiveness of these countries using the 
productivity approach is less meaningful. For instance, 
productivity in oil- exporting countries is also largely de-
termined by exogenous rather than endogenous fac-
tors. In this context, global economic activity and geo-
political events play an important part.
7 The weighted productivity differential in relation to 
56 trading partners represents the index of real GDP 
per capita, which is placed in relation to the weighted 
geometric average of the relevant indices of the trad-
ing partners. The weighting system used here is the 
same one that is used for the effective exchange rates.
8 This assumption is based on the observation that 
both relative productivity levels as well as relative 
prices represent comparatively sluggish processes and 
therefore have rather limited impacts on the price 
competitiveness of a national economy in the short 
term. However, this assumption is likely to lose its val-
idity during periods of high infl  ation differentials. For 
instance, the high infl  ation differentials observed in re-
cent years have led to marked relative price level 
changes (see pp. 19-22). Against this backdrop, the 
present article does not make use of a daily current 
forecast of indicators of price competitiveness with the 
aid of the nominal effective exchange rate.Deutsche Bundesbank

indicators of price competitiveness.24 The cal -
culation of these indicators has been switched 
to a new estimation method in an effort to 
eliminate distortions.25 The first thing to note is 
that the price competitiveness of Germany and 
the euro area, as calculated using the product -
ivity approach, has been regarded as favour -
able for around ten years now, and that it im -
proved again significantly for both economies 
in 2022. This year, the actual relative price level 
was lower than the relative price level expected 
based on the given relative productivity level by 
8% in Germany and by 15% in the euro area.
Yet the euro area’s price competitiveness pos -
ition has mostly been more favourable than 
Germany’s since 1999, except in the period 
around the global financial crisis. According to 
the latest data, Germany’s price competitive -
ness position (according to this measure) can 
be considered neutral relative to the rest of the 
euro area in the sense that its relative price 
level compared with the countries of the euro 
area is slightly (around 1%) above the bench -
mark. This may seem surprising at first glance, 
given that the euro area’s relative productivity 
level is lower than Germany’s while their rela -
tive price levels are similarly high. It should be 
remembered, though, that the indicators for 
Germany and the euro area have a different 
trading partner structure altogether, if only be -
cause a number of euro area countries rank 
among Germany’s most important trading 
partners.26Productivity

24 The results are presented with a focus on 2022, the last 
year of the estimation period. This article refrains from a 
projection using daily nominal exchange rate data as de -
scribed on p. 28 because, given the currently high inflation 
differentials, there is no assurance that disregarding them 
in the short term will remain more or less without effect.
25 See pp. 31-34.
26 A productivity approach- based indicator that measures 
Germany’s price competitiveness only relative to countries 
from outside the euro area is therefore more comparable 
with the indicator for the euro area because, in this case, 
the partner countries in question are identical and only 
their trade weights differ between the two indicators. An 
indicator of that kind developed for Germany broadly 
matches the indicator for the euro area in terms of both its 
path and its level in 2022.Deutsche Bundesbank

In the United States, meanwhile, the price 
competitiveness position as measured by the 
productivity approach has been unfavourable 
since 2015. As a result of the marked real ap -
preciation of the US dollar in 2022, it deterior -
ated again sharply, exceeding its benchmark 
that year by 16%. Given that the productivity 
level there is fairly high, the only possible ex -
planation for this outcome is the relative price 
level in the United States, as described above, 
which is likewise quite high and related to the 
pronounced strength of the US dollar in 2022. 
An exceptionally high relative price level was a 
long- standing feature of the Japanese econ -
omy in the wake of what has often been dubbed an “asset price bubble” at the begin -
ning of the 1990s. However, Japan’s price 
competitiveness has experienced strong trend 
growth over the years, mainly on the back of 
very low inflation rates. The past two years saw 
a strong nominal effective depreciation of the 
yen that provided tailwinds for this upturn. This 
is the backdrop against which Japan’s price 
competitiveness stood well below the bench -
mark in 2022, by just over 12%. China’s price 
competitiveness moved in the opposite direc -
tion to Japan’s, deteriorating rapidly in the 
2007-15 period in particular. The relative price 
level went from neutral in 2005 to around 70% 
above its benchmark in 2022. This also im -
pacted distinctly on the competitiveness pos -
itions of China’s trading partners, because a 
deterioration in the price competitiveness of a 
key trading partner like China for the countries 
under analysis will inevitably entail an improve -
ment in their own price competitiveness.
Many euro area countries’ price competitive -
ness was relatively favourable in 2022, much 
like Germany’s. Only in Finland was it unfavour -
able, whilst it was neutral in countries like Es -
tonia, Ireland, Austria and Latvia. Italy, Spain 
and Lithuania, meanwhile, enjoyed the great -
est competitive edge, each boasting values of 
around 15%. Italy’s price competitiveness 
benefited most in this regard from the fact that 
the country’s relative price level has been de -
clining in relation to the average of the euro 
area countries for around a decade now, and 
currently stands distinctly below that average.27Price competi -

27 In fact, current calculations indicate that Italy’s relative 
price level has been below the euro area average ever since 
the euro area was established. Another reason why the 
current estimate sees Italy’s price competitiveness as com -
paratively favourable is that the elasticity of the price level 
with respect to hourly productivity is now calculated as 
being somewhat lower. As a result, Italy’s relatively low 
productivity no longer has as much of a bearing as in earl -
ier estimates.Deutsche Bundesbank

A new estimation method for the productivity approach
In order to empirically determine bench-
mark values for assessing a country’s price 
competitiveness, panel estimation methods 
are generally used. Recent research sug-
gests that the methods typically employed 
in practice produce distorted benchmarks 
and thus distorted estimates of competi-
tiveness. This is because they make assump-
tions about the relationship between real 
exchange rates and their most important 
determinants that are generally not backed 
up by the data.1 In order to avoid these dis-
tortions, the Bundesbank has changed its 
method for calculating these benchmarks 
and now uses a correlated random effects 
(CRE) approach. This panel estimation 
method and the way in which it is applied 
as part of the productivity approach are 
presented below.
In most of the applications, the benchmarks 
are calculated using a fi  xed effects estima-
tor. The time series used are demeaned 
over time.2 This type of adjustment is un-
avoidable if real exchange rates are only 
available as indices. Such indices lack level 
information on the underlying relative price 
level series. Thus, in this case, the time ser-
ies do not contain any information that 
would allow for a comparison of individual 
data points across countries – i.e. a cross- 
sectional comparison – and must therefore 
be normalised through demeaning, as men-
tioned above. However, more recent re-
search papers highlight the potential and 
actual high signifi  cance of the cross- 
sectional information contained in both the 
relative price levels and their corresponding 
explanatory variables for the estimated rela-
tionship.3 If, however, these variables are 
used for the panel estimation, the question 
arises as to which method is optimal for de-
termining the benchmarks – a question that was unresolved in the literature until re-
cently.
In fact, it can be shown that the bench-
marks calculated using conventional panel 
estimation methods – such as pooled OLS, 
fi  xed effects, random effects or between ef-
fects  – are often signifi  cantly distorted. 
These distortions can be avoided by using a 
CRE model.4 In this context, conventional 
panel estimation methods are restricted 
special cases of the CRE model. The key 
element of these restrictions is that the par-
ameter estimated from the time series vari-
ation must be identical to the parameter 
estimated from the cross- sectional vari-
ation.5 If, however, the assumed restrictions 
are violated by the actual data, the conven-
tional methods produce distorted results for 
the benchmarks. It can thus be demon-
strated that these restrictions are violated in 
several use cases, including the method for 
calculating the equilibrium rate that was 
previously used by the Bundesbank. The 
1 For instance, the panel estimation methods that are 
typically used assume a priori that the real exchange 
rate is only materially infl  uenced by how its explana-
tory variables vary over time, and not how they vary 
between countries. However, evidence suggests that 
this assumption is not empirically valid; see Fischer 
(2019). The method presented here is also based on 
this research paper.
2 Examples of this include one of the EBA estimation 
methods used by the International Monetary Fund, see 
Phillips et al. (2013); a method employed by the ECB, 
see Fidora et al. (2017); and the approach used by 
Couharde et al. (2018). In the previous applications 
used by the Bundesbank, too, the benchmarks were 
determined using a panel estimation method with 
fi  xed effects; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2013b) and 
Fischer and Hossfeld (2014). However, the previous 
method differs fundamentally from traditional applica-
tions of a fi  xed effects estimator in that level data are 
used, which allow the unobserved effect to be as-
signed to the deviation from the benchmark.
3 See Cheung et al. (2007), Fischer and Hossfeld 
(2014), Adler and Grisse (2017), International Monet-
ary Fund (2017) and Berka et al. (2018).
4 The CRE model is based on Mundlak (1978).

coeffi   cients does not differ signifi  cantly from zero.Deutsche Bundesbank

method for determining the benchmarks 
was therefore switched to using the CRE 
model.
The following panel regression is estimated:
qit=(xit¯xi)1,CRE +¯xi2,CRE
+!it,CRE
where !it,CRE
=µi,CRE +"it,CRE
or, analogously:
qit=xit1,CRE +¯xi(2,CRE1,CRE )
+!it,CRE
where !it,CRE
=µi,CRE +"it,CRE ,
where qit is the logarithmic price level (real 
exchange rate) of country i  relative to the 
base country at time t and xit represents the 
corresponding logarithmic relative product-
ivity. The variable ⁻ xi is the time series aver-
age of xit; /uni00B5i,CRE is an unobserved country- 
specifi  c effect and εit,CRE is the error term.
While the estimated coeffi   cient ^β1,CRE = 
^βFE captures the effect of the time series 
variation in the data and thus corresponds 
to the fi  xed effects estimator ^βFE, the coef-
fi  cient ^β2,CRE = ^βBE represents the effect of 
the cross- sectional variation in the data and 
thus corresponds to the between effects 
estimator ^βBE.6 These coeffi   cients can be 
interpreted as elasticities of the price level 
with respect to productivity because both 
the dependent and explanatory variables 
are logarithmic variables. Here, it is as-
sumed that these elasticities are the same 
across all of the countries included in the 
panel.
The estimated elasticities are then used to 
adjust the relative price levels for the impact 
of relative productivity levels. However, in 
order to determine representative bench-
marks, all of the variables must fi  rst be placed in a multilateral context. To this end, 
the weighted average of the partner coun-
tries is subtracted from the logarithmic rela-
tive price level of country i:
˜qit=qitNX
j=1wijqjt,
where wii = 0 and /summation.textN
j=1 wij = 1. The prod-
uctivity level ~xit is analogous to the value of 
xit normalised vis- à- vis the partner coun-
tries. The multilateral benchmark for the 
relative price level ~q*

using the estimated elasticities as follows:
˜q⇤

or, analogously:
˜q⇤

Finally, the deviation of the multilateral nor-
malised price level ~qit from its benchmark   
~q*

˜dit=˜qit˜q⇤
it.
If ~dit is equal (or close) to zero, the price 
level in country i relative to the price levels 
in its partner countries corresponds 
(roughly) to the equilibrium level that would 
be expected based on its level of relative 
productivity. This would mean that the price 
competitiveness position of that particular 
country would be considered neutral. By 
contrast, its price competitiveness position 
would be considered unfavourable in the 
case of positive deviations from the bench-
mark (meaning an excessively high relative 
price level) and favourable in the case of 
negative deviations.7

the within- group variation.

uctivity approach, it should be noted that logically only 
the coeffi   cient ^β1,CRE is used when employing the CRE 
approach.Deutsche Bundesbank

The table above summarises the key results 
for the euro area, Germany, the United 
States, Japan and China obtained from the 
productivity approach using the CRE model. 
Section a) fi  rst documents the elasticities re-
sulting from the estimation of the equa-
tions described above. The estimations are 
based on annual data for the period from 
1980 to 2022.8 The fi  rst coeffi   cient of the 
CRE model ^β1,CRE/uni00A0= ^βBE indicates an esti-
mated elasticity of 0.20. The infl  uence of 
relative productivity on the relative price 
level over time is thus relatively small for 
any given country.
The second coeffi   cient of the CRE model 
^β2,CRE/uni00A0= ^βBE produces a fairly high elasti-
city of 0.42. The infl  uence of relative prod-
uctivity on the relative price level is there-
fore more than twice as large in a cross- 
country comparison as it is over time. Ac-
cordingly, the result of a Hausman test in 
section b) also suggests that the two coeffi   -
cients ^β1,CRE and ^β2,CRE are signifi  cantly dif-
ferent. This means that the restrictions as-
sumed when using conventional panel esti-mation methods are violated by the data, 
and the benchmarks calculated based on 
those estimators are correspondingly dis-
torted.
Examples of the distortions resulting from 
the use of conventional panel estimation 
methods are shown in section c). The fi  rst 
column shows the price competitiveness 
position calculated for selected countries 
for 2022 on the basis of the fi  xed effects 
estimator (FE,ω) and the second column 
shows the results of the between effects 
8 The data are not available for all of the countries 
under review from 1980 or, in some cases, are not 
taken into account until a later date for economic rea-
sons. For instance, all of the post- communist transition 
countries are only included in the panel from 1995 on-
wards because market mechanisms in those countries 
were not relevant for price formation until the 1990s. 
Argentina, Brazil and Turkey, which had to contend 
with hyperinfl  ation and the associated sharp depreci-
ation of their national currencies in the 1980s, are also 
not included until 1995 onwards.Estimated values for coeﬃ   cients and the price competitiveness of selected

Conclusion
The existing body of analytical work shows that 
the price competitiveness position of Germany 
and the euro area can currently be regarded as 
favourable. That has been the case for more 
than a decade now. The year 2022 saw the 
price competitiveness of Germany and the euro 
area improve again noticeably, mainly because 
of the weakness of the effective euro. Con -
versely, the analyses suggest that the price 
competitiveness of major trading partners of 
Germany and the euro area, such as that of the 
United States and China, could be considered 
unfavourable in 2022.
As far as individual euro area countries’ price 
competitiveness relative to the rest of the euro 
area is concerned, quite a few countries experi -
enced intra- year shifts in 2022 of a kind not 
seen since the euro was introduced. This is be -
cause the high inflation rates were also accom -
panied by high inflation differentials across euro area countries which impacted on their 
price competitiveness depending on the coun -
try’s trade structure. For example, the price 
competitiveness of manufacturers from coun -
tries where inflation rates were low relative to 
their trading partners benefited, while that of 
relatively high- inflation countries was hurt, in 
some cases significantly. Germany’s price com -
petitiveness was affected only very marginally 
by shifts of that kind, though. Calculated only 
relative to the partner countries in the euro 
area, the indicator that takes relative productiv -
ity levels into account suggests that Germany’s 
competitiveness position was neutral in 2022.
Alongside movements in nominal exchange 
rates, changes in relative energy prices also 
played an important role in the aforementioned 
shifts in price competitiveness in 2022. In this 
context, a price competitiveness indicator cal -
culated on the basis of deflators of total sales 
has proved superior to other indicators. This is 
because deflators of total sales also take prices Price competi -

the results of the CRE model (CRE, ω) and 
thus the undistorted estimation results for 
the respective competitiveness positions.
Overall, it should be noted that, compared 
with the benchmarks calculated using the 
CRE model, the benchmarks from the fi  xed 
effects estimator are more distorted than 
those from the between effects estimator. 
The deviation of 53.3  percentage points 
from the result of the CRE model in the case 
of China is particularly large. By contrast, 
Germany exhibits the smallest deviations, 
followed by Japan. Furthermore, depending 
on the estimation method used, the calcu-
lated price competitiveness position may 
even be reversed. For example, the fi  xed ef-
fects model tends to consider Germany’s 
price competitiveness position to be un-
favourable, while the undistorted result of the CRE model suggests that Germany has 
a favourable competitiveness position.
The benchmarks calculated for China are 
especially striking. In particular, the use of 
the CRE model leads to an exceptionally un-
favourable assessment of China’s price 
competitiveness. However, if the countries 
under review have an important trading 
partner, such as China, with a particularly 
unfavourable price competitiveness position,  
this implies that those respective countries 
have a better competitiveness position. This 
is refl  ected in the results for the remaining 
countries.
9 ω indicates that the price competitiveness position is 
derived from the sum of the unobserved country- 
specifi  c effect /uni00B5i,CRE and the error term εit,CRE. Such an 
approach results when the equilibrium rate is defi  ned 
as the expected value of the real exchange rate condi-
tioned on the fundamental variables (relative product-
ivity in this case).Deutsche Bundesbank

of imported intermediate inputs, which also in -
clude energy imports, into account.
Despite what is currently a favourable assess -
ment overall of Germany’s price competitive -
ness position, the dislocations experienced not -
ably last year in energy markets show that Ger -
many’s competitiveness position is also facing 
challenges. There are justified concerns that, all 
other things being equal, the persistently high 
relative energy prices are likely to have weak -
ened Germany’s international competitiveness 
in the energy- intensive production space, even 
if this has barely been reflected so far by 
changes in macroeconomic price competitive -
ness.28 Whilst it is true that price competitive -
ness is just one of many factors that has a bear -
ing on economic growth, an energy price per -
sistently well above pre-  crisis levels is likely to 
be an intermittent drag on the growth path of 
Germany’s potential output. Higher energy 
costs weaken productivity because more ex -
pensive energy inputs are needed to produce 
the same value added. In addition, energy-  
intensive property, plant and equipment would 
need to be written down.29 Overall, in that kind 
of scenario of energy prices persisting at high 
levels relative to abroad, it stands to reason 
that both the relative price level and the rela -
tive productivity level would shift to the detri -
ment of Germany, potentially diminishing Ger -
many’s price competitiveness as a result. The 
price competitiveness of energy- intensive firms 
has already deteriorated significantly. Govern -
ment policies can help maintain Germany’s 
price competitiveness by creating the right 
framework conditions and thus, for example, promoting efficiency gains and security in the 
supply of energy.30Germany’s inter -

State government finances in 2022: high 
surplus overall, some states still making 
extensive recourse to emergency borrowing
The finances of the state governments and their local governments fared very well in 2022. Their 
surplus rose considerably to €15 billion. Although the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and 
the energy crisis put a strain on budgets, tax revenue grew robustly, not least on account of infla -
tion. By contrast, inflation still had a significantly smaller impact on expenditure.
This year, the finances of the state governments and their local governments are deteriorating. A 
deficit appears possible, with temporary burdens still being incurred, however. Overall, the under -
lying dynamics in tax revenue are losing pace, and tax cuts are leading to noticeable revenue 
shortfalls. By contrast, expenditure is rising considerably, in part because inflation is now having 
a stronger impact. In addition, funds originally set aside by state governments as part of their 
crisis management strategy are likely to be spent.
The financial situation of the different state governments varies, in some cases widely. Budgets 
are particularly strained in Bremen and Saarland, which both have debt levels that far exceed the 
average. They are receiving extensive budgetary recovery assistance from central government to 
enable them to shoulder and reduce their exceptionally high current debt burdens. Nevertheless, 
both states are using the debt brake escape clause to form large debt- financed reserves.
The repayment obligations accumulated thus far from emergency borrowing diverge greatly 
between the federal states. At the end of 2022, Saarland had the highest obligations, at €3,640 
per capita. By contrast, Rhineland- Palatinate had already repaid its emergency borrowing, mak -
ing it the first state government to do so. The pandemic is no longer playing a major role from a 
fiscal perspective. The logical next step would therefore be for the state governments to stop 
spending reserves formed from coronavirus emergency borrowing. This means that existing or 
new structural challenges should be financed within the regular budget limits. Otherwise, the 
binding effect of the debt brake will be considerably weakened. A binding and effective debt 
brake is important as it guards against sharply rising interest burdens and ensures that fiscal pol -
icy remains able to act in the long term. This does not preclude a stability- oriented reform of the 
debt brake.
State government finances are still lacking in transparency and very difficult to analyse with pre -
cision. This is true, first of all, of the varying requirements arising from the state- specific debt 
brakes. Greater harmonisation of these rules would make analyses easier and would also reduce 
the variation in the fiscal requirements resulting from the debt brakes. Moreover, key budgetary 
data only become available with a lag, and their comparability is limited. The latter is especially 
true of budget plans with very different data vintages. It is also extremely difficult to maintain an 
overview of the many special pots. Better data would make it easier to identify the need for fiscal 
policy action at an early stage. The onus remains on the Stability Council, as the centrepiece of 
Germany’s fiscal surveillance, to make progress in this area.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overview
State government finances were in very good 
shape last year. State and local governments 
combined posted a large surplus, which was 
higher still than that recorded for 2021. The 
first section of this article describes the lines of 
development and the differences between the 
individual federal states. The second section 
analyses the settlement results for the state-  
specific debt brakes. It looks at which state 
governments made use of emergency borrow -
ing, and then, for comparison, investigates the 
extent to which the financial results indicate a 
need for this or suggest that reserves were built 
up. The analysis is supplemented by an over -
view of the state governments’ reported re -
serves. The final comments put the results into 
context and provide an outlook on future de -
velopments. The article also highlights the diffi -
culties still facing such analyses: missing or in -
consistent data make it more difficult to track and classify developments in areas that are cer -
tainly important.
Financial performance of 
state and local governments 
in 2022
High surplus overall due to 
strong tax increases
In 2022, state governments (including off-  
budget entities and local governments) re -
corded a high unadjusted surplus of €15 billion 
(0.4% of gross domestic product (GDP)).1 By far 
the largest surplus was in the state govern -
ments’ core budgets (€10 billion). However, 
their off- budget entities and local governments 
also each posted a surplus in aggregate terms 
(see the adjacent chart and the table on p. 42, 
item 1).2
The result, which was a further improvement 
on 2021, is founded on strong revenue growth 
(+5½%). Taxes were the main factor in this: the 
tax revenue of state and local governments 
climbed sharply, by 9% on the year. This was 
due, not least, to the marked rise in prices. By 
contrast, revenue shortfalls, particularly from 
the energy price allowance, dampened the in -
crease. All in all, tax revenue was €37 billion 
(1% of GDP) higher than the Working Party on 
Tax Revenue Estimates had expected in its pre- 
pandemic projection for 2022 (in autumn 
2019).
Expenditure grew by 4%. The main contribu -
tion to this increase was made by the major 
expenditure items personnel and other operat -Content and

example, Deutsche Bundesbank (2023a), p. 75). However, 
this statistic is already finalised at the turn of the year. Sub -
sequent closing entries worsened the result of the core

Preparation of state government data and data gaps1
The Bundesbank prepares the cash statistics 
for the purpose of presenting results for both 
the federal states as a whole and for individ-
ual state governments:
– Off- budget entities and local governments 
are included to ensure that the picture of 
the fi  scal situation is complete and com-
parable across federal states. This means 
that data are no longer distorted if federal 
states shift tasks and funding burdens be-
tween these entities. It also makes it easier 
to compare city states and non- city states.
– Structural balances are calculated to allow 
for an assessment of the underlying situ-
ation. To this end, fi  nancial transactions 
(e.g. loans issued), cyclical infl  uences and 
known one- off effects are stripped from 
the unadjusted fi  scal balance. In addition, 
amounts arising from the fi  nancial equal-
isation scheme and supplementary central 
government grants are allocated on an ac-
cruals basis (according to provisional settle-
ment fi  gures). The data are adjusted for 
cyclical infl  uences using the Bundesbank’s 
procedure, with its spring macroeconomic 
forecast serving as the basis.
Weaknesses in the dataset
There are still some weaknesses that impair 
comparability between the federal states. 
Specifi  cally:
– The structural balance for the federal states 
as an aggregate is adjusted for the one- off 
effects stemming from coronavirus and en-
ergy price measures. However, these can-
not be fully attributed to the individual fed-
eral states. Given this, the balances of the 
individual states are not adjusted for these 
measures. Hence, the balances are only 
partially adjusted.
– State governments do not all record, say, 
coronavirus aid for fi  rms provided by cen-
tral government in the same way. Instead 
of treating them uniformly as current trans-
fers to enterprises, some states record such 
fl  ows as other operating expenditure or as non- investment capital transfers. In add-
ition, central government- funded aid 
changes the balance in some cases: rev-
enue from and expenditure on assistance 
channelled through from central govern-
ment do not always match up in a single 
reporting year. This does not just apply to 
coronavirus aid for businesses. The reason 
for this is the accounting approach em-
ployed, which is not coordinated between 
central government and the state govern-
ments.
– Payments to enterprises are sometimes 
booked as acquisitions of participating 
interests, despite the fact that they are off-
setting losses. There is not enough infor-
mation available to quantify such loss com-
pensation payments (and to record them 
as defi  cit- increasing). The structural out-
turn is then cast in too favourable a light. If 
the federal states take this approach in the 
context of their debt brakes, they carve out 
scope for borrowing.
– Selected categories of expenditure delin-
eated by the individual states are compar-
able to only a limited extent. Payments be-
tween the core budget and its off- budget 
entities are consolidated for aggregates 
rather than for the specifi  c categories.2
– The data for Saarland were particularly 
skewed in the reporting year. In the cash 
statistics, off- budget entities recorded 
loans of €3½ billion granted to the core 
budget. No corresponding revenue is re-
corded in the cash statistics for the core 
budget, however. The cash statistics (as 
usual) consolidate the core budget with 
the off- budget entities. This involves de-
ducting off- budget entity loan outfl  ows 
from the fi  gure for loans received by the 
core budget. As a result, this capital rev-
enue is heavily negative. This causes very 
low overall revenue and a high defi  cit.

ing expenditure, which went up by 5% and 
6½%, respectively. One factor in this rise was 
the considerable growth in the number of 
staff.3 The high inflation rate is likely to have 
had only a limited impact last year, at least in 
the case of personnel expenditure – wage ad -
justments, for example, remained largely un -
affected by it. Pandemic- related expenditure 
fell significantly. This was particularly true for 
current transfers to enterprises. For the state 
governments, these costs are mostly a transit 
item, as they are largely borne by central gov -
ernment.
Here, the structural surplus is estimated at €47 
billion. It improved significantly more strongly 
than the unadjusted balance (see the table 
above, items 1 and 8).
(a) In comparison with the unadjusted cash fig -
ure, the structural balance was improved by 
the following factors, which are excluded:
– burdens of €12 billion due to financial trans -
actions (at the state government level, these 
were primarily the loans issued in Saarland4);
– temporary burdens of €13 billion due to 
coronavirus response measures (based on 
draft legislation and Bundesbank surveys, 
primarily temporary tax relief, expenditure on coronavirus tests in schools and costs of 
vaccination centres);
– temporary burdens of €9½ billion due to 
measures taken in response to the energy 
crisis (Bundesbank estimate based on draft 
legislation, primarily revenue shortfalls re -
sulting from the energy price allowance).
(b) In comparison with the unadjusted cash fig -
ure, the structural balance was worsened by 
the following factors, which are excluded:
– relief of just over €1½ billion due to the fa -
vourable economic situation (Bundesbank 
estimate);
– relief of almost €1 billion due to the non-  
accruals- based accounting of financial 
equalisation (central government grants).
However, the structural budgetary situation 
should be interpreted with caution. On the

here. The one- off effects on the budget results 
are difficult to capture. They could be overesti -
mated, say, because it is sometimes difficult to 
separate out temporary one- off effects.
The favourable structural situation also reflects 
the fact that the sharp rise in inflation consider -
ably eased the burden on budgets at first, lead -
ing to rapid growth in tax revenue. By contrast, 
expenditure is slower to reflect higher inflation 
– for instance, in the state governments’ per -
sonnel expenditure, a major spending item. 
Cyclical adjustment only refers to real develop -
ments. Inflation effects are still included.
Moreover, the estimated cyclical effects on the 
budget balances are uncertain, especially at the 
current end. They were recently revised for the 
previous years.5 According to the current as -
sessment, the cyclical effects in the reporting 
years of 2022 and 2021 were small.
A comparison of individual 
federal states
State- specific balances only partially 
adjusted 
This article reports cash data and partially ad -
justed balances for the individual federal states 
(including off- budget entities and local govern -
ments); see the detailed table on pp.  60 f. 
These figures are usually shown in relation to 
the respective population size, making them 
more comparable between states. However, 
temporary crisis measures cannot be factored 
out individually, as the data for some states are 
incomplete (temporary crisis burdens of €260 
per capita are deducted from the state govern -
ment aggregate). Accordingly, the actual struc -
tural results of the individual state governments 
are more favourable than those shown here in 
the partially adjusted balances (see p. 41 for in -
formation on the preparation of state govern -
ment data).Balances vary considerably from state to 
state
Based on unadjusted figures, three- quarters of 
state governments reported a surplus for 2022. 
For state governments as an aggregate, it 
stood at €180 per capita (2021: €60). At just 
under €5,000 per capita, the range between 
the highest and lowest balance was very wide. 
This is mainly due to the high deficit in Saarland 
resulting from the inconsistent booking of an 
intra- state loan (see p. 41). The very high sur -
plus in Hamburg was also attributable to a one- 
off effect: large profit distributions by a local 
logistics company made a considerable contri -
bution to the balance.6 Excluding Saarland and 
Hamburg, the results of the federal states were 
up to €920 per capita apart.High inflation

For state governments as an aggregate, the 
partially adjusted surplus stood at €290 (2021: 
€160). Among the city states, Hamburg again 
posted the highest surplus, at a very large 
€2,000 per capita (2021: €250). Once more, 
Rhineland- Palatinate recorded the highest sur -
plus of the non- city states, at €730 per capita 
(2021: €500). Its relatively high tax revenue, ap -
parently not least from a vaccine manufacturer, 
played a role in this.7 In both federal states, 
one- off factors contributed to the very favour -
able balance (profit distribution, exceptionally 
high tax revenue). As in the previous year, 
Bremen recorded the highest per capita deficit. 
The city state increased its partially adjusted 
deficit significantly to €290 (2021: €150). This is 
also noteworthy because Bremen is receiving 
budgetary recovery assistance from central 
government, which is actually conditional on 
surpluses for minimum repayments.8 In North 
Rhine-  Westphalia, the partially adjusted deficit 
amounted to €130 (2021: surplus of €70). This 
year- on- year deterioration was driven by the fact that, first, central government funds for 
coronavirus- related business aid from 2021 
were disbursed with a delay. Second, there 
were temporary burdens arising from the reso -
lution of the Landesbank.

7 For the partially adjusted balance, financial equalisation is 
allocated according to the lagged provisional settlement. 
This is particularly significant for Rhineland- Palatinate, 
which, at the beginning of 2022, made large payments to 
state governments as an aggregate for 2021. However, 
after adjustment for the lagged settlement, the state re -
ceived payments from the financial equalisation scheme in 
2022. On balance, the accruals-  based allocation of pay -
ments contributed just over one- third to the surplus in 
Rhineland- Palatinate.
8 By contrast, Saarland, which is also receiving budgetary 
recovery assistance, recorded a surplus after partial adjust -
ment. Even without the recovery assistance, moreover, it 
still would have been slightly in surplus.
9 Tax revenue accounted for around 70% of total revenue. 
Here, it is recorded for the individual federal states on an 
accruals basis (based on the provisional settlement under 
the state government financial equalisation scheme, but 
with the subsequent full inclusion of local government 
taxes collected).Deutsche Bundesbank

 between the non- city states stood at €780. 
Frontrunner Hesse (just over €6,200) outper -
formed last- place Brandenburg by 14% (see 
also the table on pp. 60 f., item 19). The state 
government financial equalisation scheme (in -
cluding supplementary central government 
grants that are dependent on financial cap -
acity) does not aim to completely eliminate dif -
ferences. In addition, state governments in -
cluding their local governments sometimes 
have varying real estate acquisition tax rates as 
well as different multipliers for real estate and 
local business tax. The financial equalisation 
scheme is not designed to minimise any result -
ing revenue differences. Higher multipliers for 
local government tax rates thus explain roughly 
one- third of Hesse’s revenue advantage over 
Brandenburg.
In 2022, central government transfers were 
high, at €890 per capita across the federal 
states. However, they fell considerably on the 
year (-€140 per capita; see the table on 
pp. 62 f., item 21). The main reason for this was 
that central government provided significantly 
lower funds for transfers to enterprises in re -
sponse to the coronavirus pandemic.10 This de -
crease does not actually put any strain on the 
state governments as they are merely a conduit 
for the funds. However, this relaying of funds 
was lagged to some extent in previous years 
and also in 2022, affecting the balance either 
positively or negatively for the reporting year. 
All in all, however, these effects seem to be 
limited.
On the expenditure side, state government 
budgets can be compared to only a limited ex -
tent. One reason for this is that the federal 
states do not record certain transactions in a 
uniform manner. One major example is corona -
virus aid for businesses provided by central 
government. For instance, North Rhine-  
Westphalia, rather than classifying it as grants 
to enterprises, recorded a large part of it as 
other operating expenditure (under “other 
grants”). Bavaria and Lower Saxony, in particu -
lar, classified some of the aid as non- investment capital transfers. Saxony-  Anhalt and Saarland, 
meanwhile, recorded the expenditure as trans -
fers to persons. The central and state govern -
ment budgetary planning system to be used 
throughout Germany is supposed to guarantee 
the comparability of figures. Even in the wake 
of the pandemic, action is still needed to en -
sure that identical forms of expenditure are 
also identically categorised (for the differenti -
ation of financial transactions from transfers to 
loss compensation, see the box on p. 41).
Differences can also be seen in debt and 
interest burden
The debt of state and local governments stood 
at just over €820 billion, or almost €9,800 per 
capita, across Germany.11 Bremen had by far 
the highest per capita figure (almost €34,400), 
followed by Saarland. The lowest figure was re -
corded in Saxony (just over €2,700), followed 
by Bavaria.
Together with the large surplus, debt fell on ag -
gregate by close to €19 billion (coupled with 
the alleviating population growth: almost €340 
per capita; see the table on pp. 62 f., item 23). 
There were declines in almost all federal states. 
This was especially clear to see in the highly in -
debted state of Bremen (-€19,800 per capita, 
or -€13 billion). However, this was not due to 
budgetary developments (which were actually 
in the opposite direction), but rather to revalu -Tax revenue up

recorded revenue with a time lag, with the result that the 
pattern of central government figures is reflected some -
what differently in these instances. This may also negatively 
affect comparability among federal states.
11 The figures presented are taken from the debt statistics 
of the Federal Statistical Office. They comprise debt to the 
non- public sector (the capital market, here and in the re -
mainder of the article including the credit market) and to 
the public sector. By contrast, debt as defined under 
budgetary rules can additionally include borrowing author -
isations not used to make payments. These are then avail -
able as reserves (in core budgets or off- budget entities). 
However, no funds have yet been raised on the capital 
market.Deutsche Bundesbank

ations of derivatives amid rising interest rates.12 
By contrast, per capita debt grew particularly 
sharply in Saarland (+€2,500). While debt to 
the non- public sector declined, this was heavily 
outweighed by the increase in debt to the pub -
lic sector (as shown on p. 41, excluding the rev -
enue effect). It appears that the state govern -
ment budget not only allocated budgetary re -
sources to its new Transformation Fund (like 
when central government prefinanced the Cli -
mate Fund) but also handed over debt instru -
ments at its expense. Thus Saarland did not 
take out any forward loans on the capital mar -
ket (to secure favourable interest rates, for ex -
ample). Any interest rates associated with this play no role in overall state government 
finances, as they are contained within the fed -
eral state. Funding via the capital market and 
the associated interest burden are still out -
standing. Meanwhile, Saxony-  Anhalt’s debt 
rose despite a fiscal surplus because the state 
wanted to secure favourable financing condi -
tions in the capital market.13
The interest rate reversal is particularly signifi -
cant for federal states with comparatively high 
per capita debt and poor structural budget bal -
ances. In 2022, the interest rate increases were 
not yet reflected in the interest burden on fed -
eral states as an aggregate. However, as refi -
nancing becomes increasingly necessary, the 
interest rate hikes will be felt unless lower inter -
est rates have been hedged using derivatives.
The average rate of interest on debt14 varies 
from state to state, in some cases greatly. While 
the federal states are often able to take out 
new loans at fairly similar conditions, interest 
rate fixation periods, shares of loans from the 
low interest rate period and interest rate 
hedges differ. Premia or discounts on bond 
issues can also have an impact if federal states 
record these immediately rather than allocating 
them over the term of the bonds.15 Information 
on the above- mentioned factors is incomplete, 
however.Interest rate

12 The federal state holds a large volume of interest rate 
derivatives that safeguard interest rate conditions in the 
long term. Market interest rates have risen over time. As a 
result, the market value of derivatives improved by almost 
€11 billion compared with the end of 2021 (to be more 
precise, the negative market value fell to €1½ billion). 
Bremen was required to provide a correspondingly lower 
amount of cash collateral for the derivatives and was able 
to repay the loans it took out for this purpose. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2021a), p. 24, for information on 
the impact of derivatives on debt and discrepancies be -
tween the fiscal balance and changes in debt levels. For 
information specific to Bremen, see Bremen Parliament 
(2023) and Bremen Parliament (2022).

The average rate of interest on debt fell slightly 
on the year across Germany, declining by 
0.1 percentage point to 1.4% (see the tables on 
pp. 60 f. and pp. 62 f., item 24 in both cases). 
Last year, the highest average interest rates 
were again calculated for Baden-  Württemberg 
(2.5%) and the lowest once more for Saxony 
(0.7%). In Baden-  Württemberg, average inter -
est rates fell particularly sharply due to one 
interest- bearing debt instrument falling due in 
the previous year.16 Lower Saxony recorded the 
strongest increase (+0.3 percentage point), to 
which the absence of premia appears to have 
made a major contribution. Still, the level thus 
achieved remained just short of the national 
average.
In some cases, debt is offset by interest- bearing 
assets. Interest payments between core 
budgets and off- budget entities play a role 
here. These are sometimes significant – such as 
payments from the core budget to pension 
pots in Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania. In the 
government finance statistics, interest pay -
ments between core budgets and off- budget 
entities within a federal state are not consoli -
dated. The interest burden therefore appears 
too high. Looking at the net interest burden, 
where interest income is deducted from inter -
est expenditure, is helpful in this regard. The 
largest net interest burden per capita was re -
corded by the city states and Saarland (see the 
table on pp.  60 f., item 8, and the adjacent 
chart). In Bremen, it accounted for just over 
12% of tax revenue. Payments for derivatives 
and interest on collateral made a significant 
contribution to this according to the state gov -
ernment’s budget plan.17 The ratio was slightly 
above 3% in Hamburg and Berlin, and a little 
over 5% in Saarland.
Saarland and Bremen are receiving budgetary 
recovery assistance from central government to 
help them pay the interest burdens stemming 
from their high debt. This assistance is de -
ducted to reveal the remaining interest burden. 
For example, the ratio in Bremen is only 4½%. 
In Saarland, it is even negative (-2%). Thus, the assistance provided to Saarland exceeds its un -
adjusted net interest burden.

Budget preparation still 
shaped by crises
How the COVID-  19 crisis would continue to un -
fold was still uncertain when state govern -
ments drew up their budget plans for 2022. 
Against this backdrop, the majority of state 
governments (much like central government) 
once again activated the escape clauses in their 
debt brakes. Once the year had started, the en -
ergy crisis stemming from the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine followed. Some 
federal states then also explicitly cited the en -
ergy crisis as grounds for emergency borrow -
ing. By contrast, other federal states (such as 
Baden-  Württemberg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-  
West Pomerania, Rhineland- Palatinate and 
Thuringia) planned to use available reserves in -
stead of emergency borrowing to balance their 
budgets. In fact, Lower Saxony’s budget plan 
already provided for a small surplus to meet the 
requirements of its debt brake.
Reserves from emergency 
borrowing  increased in some 
cases; hardly any repayments 
despite surpluses
Some federal states actually resorted to emer -
gency borrowing in the course of implement -
ing their plans for 2022. As a result, outstand -
ing emergency borrowing for the federal states 
as an aggregate rose by just over €3½ billion 
on balance. How this can be reconciled with 
the large unadjusted surplus is analysed below 
by means of a rough calculation (for informa -
tion on the method, see the box on p. 49).
For the federal states as an aggregate in 2022, 
the starting point for the rough calculation is 
the surplus, including off- budget entities, of €16 billion. Deducted from this are a high level 
of cyclical relief (i.e. a positive cyclical effect) of 
€9½ billion20 and a deficit of just over €1 billion 
from financial transactions (according to state 
government data in each case). This yields a 
debt brake- approximated surplus of €7½ bil -
lion. Emergency borrowing could have been re -
paid with this calculated financial scope result -
ing from the 2022 surplus. However, on bal -
ance, the federal states actually resorted to 
new emergency borrowing to the tune of just 
over €3½ billion. This means that, instead of 
possible repayments of emergency borrowing, 
a build- up of reserves in the amount of €11 bil -
lion can be calculated. This was much more 
limited than in previous years, though.
Six federal states made recourse to emergency 
borrowing totalling €8½ billion. In per capita 
terms, Saarland is the frontrunner on the new 
emergency borrowing front (just over €3,000), 
which it used to build up very large reserves. 
An acute need for financing that could justify 
making recourse to emergency borrowing can 
be identified to only a very limited extent. In -
stead, the funds were used mainly to provide 
advance financing for the new Transformation 
Fund. At €1,500 per capita, the city state of 
Bremen has the second highest level of net 
emergency borrowing.21 Whilst its structural 
financing needs are considerable, which is 
partly due to the relatively high cyclical relief 
that has been factored in (see the table on In 2022, too,

20 According to state government data, cyclical relief is 
much greater than had been estimated by the Bundesbank. 
This is because many federal states regard tax revenue de -
viating from expectations in the budget plan as cyclical (de -
viations caused by legislative changes were previously 
deemed not cyclical and deducted). Overall, actual tax rev -
enue exceeded the key expectations from the budget plan 
considerably in 2022.
21 Like the increases in previous years, the decrease in debt 
related to derivatives described on p. 45 is not recorded in 
the budget plans or accounts.Deutsche Bundesbank

How the Bundesbank approximates the need for emer-
gency borrowing and the scope for it to be repaid
For analytical purposes, the Bundesbank 
fi  rst calculates fi  scal balances for the federal 
states that are approximated to their debt 
brakes. The results provide a rough indica-
tion of the extent to which there were 
structural fi  nancing needs over and above 
regular revenue.
– The starting point for the rough calcula-
tion is the balance of the core budgets 
and off- budget entities of the individual 
federal states (see the table on p. 51, col-
umn 1). By contrast, almost all state gov-
ernments target net borrowing in their 
debt brakes. Many also disregard the 
balances of their off- budget entities. The 
Bundesbank takes a different approach 
in order to obtain an approximation of 
the federal states’ actual budgetary situ-
ation. This can, in fact, be obscured if 
borrowing is used to prefi  nance special 
funds or, ultimately, to build reserves in 
the core budget. The rough calculation is 
conducted based on data that have been 
adjusted for such operations.1 In order to 
fulfi  l this function, the consolidation of 
revenue in Saarland (see p. 41) was also 
corrected for in the reporting year. This 
raised the balance here by €3½ billion as 
compared to the budgetary statistics.
– In addition, cyclical infl  uences and fi  nan-
cial transactions are adjusted for, in each 
case based on the data provided by the 
state governments (see the table on 
p. 51, columns 2 and 3). The adjustment 
of the balance thus takes into account 
the state- specifi  c design of the debt 
brakes. The Bundesbank consequently 
calculates the balance for a state govern-
ment, including its off- budget entities, in 
a demarcation approximated to its re-spective debt brake. If this balance is 
negative, the federal state has positive 
fi  nancing needs (a defi  cit).
The debt brake- approximated fi  nancing 
needs calculated using this method are 
then compared, in a second step, with the 
reported net borrowing via emergency bor-
rowing (see the table on p. 51, columns 4 
and 5). The difference between these two 
fi  gures provides an indication of the extent 
to which reserves were formed from emer-
gency borrowing in the reporting year. If, 
for example, a federal state builds reserves 
in its core budget or prefi  nances special 
funds, the emergency borrowing exceeds 
its fi  nancing needs. The difference also indi-
cates whether reserves were used to limit or 
repay emergency borrowing. This is the 
case, say, if the repayment amount exceeds 
the debt brake- approximated surplus.
1 As a result, this fi  gure also does not refl  ect transfers 
to precautionary government funds to cover new ex-
penses in connection with civil servants’ pensions or 
from guarantees. Such transfers can refl  ect expenses in 
these fi  elds on an accruals basis, ultimately making 
them meaningful.Deutsche Bundesbank

p.  51, column 3),22 the comparison suggests 
that Bremen, too, substantially topped up its 
reserves.23
Saarland and Bremen are receiving extensive 
budgetary recovery assistance from central 
government. The aim of this is to enable them 
to shoulder their high debt and comply with 
debt brake requirements. The recipient states 
had committed themselves to using one- fifth 
of their annual recovery assistance of €400 mil -
lion each to reduce their debt levels. In the cri -
sis setting last year, they resorted to emergency 
borrowing on a particularly large scale to build 
up reserves. The Stability Council had already 
recognised that there was a looming budgetary 
emergency in Bremen at the end of last year 
and therefore called for a recovery programme. 
In the spring of 2023, Bremen decided to scale 
up its emergency borrowing significantly in the 
absence of any immediate financial need.North Rhine-  Westphalia, too, made use of 
emergency borrowing on a large scale (owing 
to its size, it accounts for almost half of the 
borrowing in Germany). This was roughly in 
line with the level of financing needs calcu -
lated. Saxony, Hamburg and Bavaria increased 
their emergency borrowing slightly. For these 
three federal states, by contrast, the back- of- 
the- envelope calculation suggests that this was 
not to cover financing needs but rather a 
means to repay borrowing.
Despite having activated the escape clause, 
Brandenburg and Schleswig-  Holstein repaid a 
rather large volume of emergency borrowing, 
predominantly using reserves which they had 
previously financed from emergency borrow -
ing. Saxony-  Anhalt, which had also activated 
the escape clause, repaid loans in its cyclical 
offset reserve in the amount of the positive 
cyclical component and topped it up with add -
itional funds. On balance, it reduced emer -
gency borrowing to a small extent, too, by re -
leasing reserves that were freed up in the 
coronavirus special fund as a result of some 
previously planned measures not being imple -
mented. Baden-  Württemberg, Lower Saxony 
and Thuringia likewise repaid emergency bor -
rowing. In arithmetical terms, their budget out -
turns enabled them to make repayments with -
out having to draw on reserves on balance. 
Together, repayments of emergency borrowing 
in the six federal states named above amounted 
to €5 billion. However, arithmetically speaking, 
significantly larger repayments would have 
been possible, in particular in Thuringia. In -
stead, this federal state appears to have topped 
up reserves.

from the previous year. Hesse had likewise acti -
vated the debt brake escape clause. It reported 
that it had more than fulfilled the obligations 
for repaying cyclical debt by paying off cyclical 
loans and transferring funds to the cyclical off -
set reserve.24 Rhineland- Palatinate had already

Surpluses were channelled into reserves.
Large volume of emergency 
borrowing pending future 
 repayment
The debt brake requires the federal states to 
adopt repayment schedules for their emer -
gency borrowing. At the end of 2022, the fed -
eral states reported total pending repayments 
of €74 billion (€880 per capita). The repayment 
obligations accumulated so far vary consider -
ably from state to state. Rhineland- Palatinate 
no longer has any outstanding emergency bor -rowing. Meanwhile, the highest levels are re -
corded in Saarland (€3,640) and Bremen 
(€2,960). Bremen and Berlin are planning to 
resort to further emergency borrowing this 
year in connection with the energy crisis.25 This 
would push up the per capita repayment 
amounts considerably, by around €4,400 (in 
Bremen) and €1,300 (in Berlin), respectively. 
The federal states’ repayment periods are also 
very different. Saxony plans to repay its emer -
gency borrowing in six steps by 2028. North 
Rhine-  Westphalia’s planned repayment period, 
by contrast, extends into 2070 (see the chart 
on p. 52).

– to a large extent in some cases – that ease 
the repayment burdens. The reserves can now 
be used for repayment, rendering it unneces -
sary to find funds for repayment from else -
where in the budget. Overall, the total volume 
of all reported reserves significantly exceeds the 
outstanding amount that the federal states as a 
whole have to repay for emergency borrowing. 
However, the extent to which these reserves 
have already been designated for specific ex -
penditure items is not clear. Reserves ear -
marked for pension funds and cyclical reserves 
are considered designated. Excluding these 
amounts already set aside, reserves would fully 
or broadly cover repayment obligations in most 
federal states (see the chart on p. 55). If federal 
states use reserves from emergency borrowing 
to fill gaps in their budgets, they will shift fund -
ing burdens into the future. Instead of doing 
this, it would seem logical to use reserves from 
emergency borrowing to bring forward repay -
ment, as Brandenburg and Schleswig- Holstein, 
in particular, have done in the reporting year.Conclusion
Outlook: address fiscal policy 
challenges
State government finances are deteriorating 
sharply this year – though from a very favour -
able level. A deficit appears possible, albeit 
with temporary burdens still being incurred. 
Revenue has declined so far, whilst expenditure 
has risen markedly. Growth in revenue is likely 
to remain weak for the year as a whole due, 
not least, to long- term tax relief. Expenditure 
growth is expected to barely abate, shored up, 
inter alia, by the use of reserves.
The federal states are facing fiscal challenges. 
By next year at the latest, the higher prices are 
also likely to have a stronger impact on spend -
ing on personnel, a particularly large expend -
iture item. In addition, growth in potential out -
put is set to remain subdued. Demographic 
developments and the energy transition, too, However, high

to repay emergency borrowing faster. Alternatively, they can opt for lower annual repayment amounts and a longer repayment period. 
Saxony-Anhalt has distributed its total repayment volume of around €1,000 per capita over 22 years, repaying just short of €50 per 
capita each year. North Rhine-Westphalia has spread a similar total repayment volume over 50 years, repaying only around €20 per 
capita each year.

State government reserves as at the end of 2022
In almost all federal states, the debt brake 
targets and places tight limits on net bor-
rowing. Cyclical factors and fi  nancial trans-
actions can be taken into account. Outside 
of this, higher net borrowing is only an op-
tion in emergency situations. To ensure 
additional room for manoeuvre beyond 
such emergency situations, it is necessary to 
set aside funds. State governments have a 
number of options for building up such re-
serves. They make particularly widespread 
use of reserves in the core budget and in 
special funds.1 They generally do not build 
up cash balances, but instead make only 
formal use of borrowing authorisations 
when implementing the budget. In this 
way, state governments maintain longer- 
term scope for borrowing in the capital 
market (whereas formally unused borrow-
ing authorisations lapse relatively quickly). 
While there are restrictive provisions for the 
use of reserves in most cases, it is likely also 
possible to mobilise the funds put aside on 
an ad hoc basis if necessary, potentially by 
changing the legislation. Thuringia, for ex-
ample, withdrew the entire remaining bal-
ance of its pension fund at the end of 
2022.2
There is still no complete overview of these 
reserves. The large number of reserve pots 
makes it impossible to evaluate budget ac-
counts, for example, in this report. Gather-
ing data on reserve stocks is important in 
order to better gauge what shape state 
government fi  nances are in. Consequently, 
the Stability Council is advised to ensure the 
availability of clear data.
For this Monthly Report, the Bundesbank 
asked the state governments about their re-
serve stocks as at the end of 2022. They 
provided comparable information about their stocks of pre- fi  nanced special funds 
and reserves. Where gaps remained was in 
their data on other forms of transferring 
borrowing authorisations to later years. 
Such reserves therefore could not be in-
cluded in the comparison.
The state governments reported €128 bil-
lion in reserves in their core budgets and in 
special funds. However, there is no informa-
tion on what percentage of these stocks are 
tied up by specifi  c measures. Prior- year fi  g-
ures are included in isolated cases.
– The fi  gure reported for general reserves 
came to €33 billion (€400 per capita) at 
the end of 2022. These reserves thus re-
mained unchanged on balance from the 
previous year, not least as a result of 
reclassifi  cations  of funds from general 
reserves  to special- purpose reserves. 
The general reserves per capita are espe-
cially high in Hamburg (€1,960) and 
Mecklenburg- West Pomerania (€1,460). 
Saarland, Saxony- Anhalt and Schleswig- 
Holstein did not have any general re-
serves, possibly because of tight legal 
provisions relating to credit fi  nancing.
– The cyclical offset reserves increased very 
strongly to €11 billion. This growth was 
mainly due to higher balances in Ham-
burg and Hesse. Bremen also made sig-

rowing authorisations to later years, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022a), p. 25.

from one- off relief of €70 per capita. North Rhine- 
Westphalia recently drafted a law that puts an end to 
the present transfers from the core budget to the pen-
sion fund. Interest income from the fund is intended to 
ease the strain on the core budget. It is envisaged that 
this will provide relief of €30 per capita in the state 
budget. See State Parliament of North Rhine- 
Westphalia (2023).Deutsche Bundesbank

nifi  cant additions to its reserve. Insofar 
as these reserves are based on symmet-
rical cyclical adjustment over the cycle, 
they do not provide any room for man-
oeuvre. All they can do is offset cyclical 
budgetary burdens in the future.
– Reserves relating to COVID- 19 grew to 
€17 billion, apparently mainly due to re-
classifi  cations. Berlin had the highest per 
capita fi  gure (€920; previous year: part 
of the general reserve), followed by 
Saxony- Anhalt (€680). The latter had 
only fi  lled its coronavirus special fund 
with loans from the core budget at the 
end of 2021. In 2022, the state govern-
ment had used up one- quarter of the 
balance.
– Reserves in pre- fi  nanced off- budget en-
tities for investment purposes remained 
unchanged on aggregate, at around €7 
billion. In Saxony, funds were withdrawn 
from a reserve of this kind. Schleswig- 
Holstein added funds of a similar 
amount.
– Civil servant pensions place a consider-
able strain on state government budgets, 
especially in the western German states. 
Many states are continuing to increase 
their reserves for this purpose, which 
have been built up over many years. Pen-
sion pots are thus the largest item among 
the reserves. The reported amount (€50 
billion) changed only slightly, however. 
Unlike central government, some state 
governments have already dipped into 
their civil servant pension reserves. In 
addition, as was the case for central gov-
ernment, price losses on bonds due to 
rising interest rates are likely to have put 
a considerable strain on these pension 
reserves. Saxony has the largest amount 
by far, at €2,510 per capita.– The other reserves reported by state gov-
ernments increased to €8 billion. The 
Bundesbank included the non- 
consolidated lending of €3½ billion from 
off- budget entities in Saarland (see p. 41) 
in this fi  gure. The decisive factor was 
that these bookings chiefl  y served to fi  ll 
the Transformation Fund. Schleswig- 
Holstein used €2½ billion from these 
other reserves to repay emergency loans. 
Roughly that amount again has now 
been allocated for specifi  c purposes and 
thus was no longer contained in other 
reserves.Deutsche Bundesbank

entail a need for adjustment.26 At the same 
time, there are plans to expand and improve 
education and childcare. The federal states also 
want to speed up approval procedures consid -
erably. These projects require additional funds 
and, in some cases, more own staff as well.
Ultimately, it is crucial for central, state and 
local government to increase the cost-  
effectiveness of their services. Digitalisation can 
make an important contribution in this context. 
Ensuring that specific tasks as well as the finan -
cial responsibility for them are both clearly as -
signed to one level of government would also 
go a long way towards improving cost-  
effectiveness. This government level would 
then have a stronger incentive to offer the pub -
lic the services they require at a cost- effective 
rate. The federal system could thus be utilised 
to a greater extent in the development of “best 
practices”. For this purpose, it would be expe -
dient to obtain a better comparison of how 
much the various federal states spend on and earn from specific public services. The aim 
should be to identify and consistently make use 
of potential efficiency gains. In other areas, by 
contrast, it may be advantageous to follow a 
centralised approach throughout Germany. If, 
as with digitalisation, for instance, the aim is to 
speed up decision- making and avoid costly du -
plication of work, much speaks in favour of giv -
ing central government more power.
Emergency borrowing should 
be clearly bound to a crisis
The debt brakes allow, for good reason, add -
itional borrowing if required in an emergency. 
It is therefore understandable that the federal 
states activated the escape clauses in the wake 
of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the es -
cape clauses should not be used to cover fore -
seeable longer- term structural financing needs. Strengthen cost-

Strictly limiting credit financing is not an end in 
itself. Such a limitation instead helps individual 
entities to maintain their autonomous fiscal 
capacity – even in the event of rising interest 
rates. That is why it is important to use emer -
gency borrowing only as a targeted response 
to a specific crisis. A binding and effective debt 
brake is important. It protects against sharply 
rising interest burdens and ensures fiscal policy -
makers can take action in the long term. This 
does not preclude a stability- oriented reform of 
the debt brake.27
It is often impossible to predict how emergen -
cies will develop, and it is essential to ensure 
that fiscal policy countermeasures can be im -
plemented swiftly. Therefore, a broad frame -
work of action sometimes seems appropriate 
to stand ready should the situation take a turn 
for the worse. As a result, it may transpire that 
authorisations for emergency borrowing prove 
to have been too generous. Nevertheless, it 
seems inappropriate to retain any remaining 
scope from emergency borrowing as reserves 
for future years. Should an emergency persist, 
Parliament can then, if necessary, activate the 
escape clause for a further year and, at the 
same time, establish the specific crisis reso -
lution measures for that year.
In actual fact, many federal states have built up 
reserves from emergency borrowing. These are 
apparently intended to fund structural projects, 
even after the crisis has been overcome. While 
some federal states have now depleted their 
reserves, others continue to top them up.
Saarland and Bremen receive central govern -
ment assistance to comply with their debt 
brake. Given their high level of debt, it scarcely 
seemed possible that they would be able to do 
so independently. The assistance is partly tied 
to the condition that the two federal states re -
duce their debt levels. Of late, they have made 
use of emergency borrowing, not only as an 
acute crisis aversion measure. This further bor -
rowing instead has served to build up particu -
larly extensive reserves to finance expenditure in future years. A state receiving budgetary re -
covery assistance can claim a special need for 
new debt owing to an emergency situation. It 
is then up to the Federal Ministry of Finance, in 
particular, to examine the extent to which this 
is compatible with the administrative agree -
ments on budgetary recovery assistance.28 In 
addition, the Stability Council is tasked with re -
questing a suitable recovery programme in the 
event that the debt burden should risk being 
too high.29
Three guiding principles would – in the sense 
of a stringent debt brake – limit the subsequent 
burdens stemming from interest on and repay -
ments of emergency borrowing. First, reserves 
still available from coronavirus emergency bor -
rowing should be released directly for repay -
ment, as the pandemic no longer plays a major 
role from a fiscal perspective. Second, in the 
acute energy crisis, central government took 
broad support measures. The need for add -
itional action on the part of the federal states 
should be examined thoroughly and sufficiently 
justified. By contrast, foreseeable longer- term 
structural needs, such as those arising in con -
nection with the energy transition, should be 
financed within the regular framework. Third, 
reserves for unforeseen circumstances should 
be built up in the regular budgetary process – 
i.e. without debt in excess of the debt brake 
limit.
Improve data availability
The data situation has not improved over the 
past few years.30 Despite the high level of ef -

with the additional knowledge provided by 
state finance ministries and statistical offices. 
Action is required here. It should be possible to 
provide meaningful data for individual govern -
ment tasks as well. This could make it easier to 
identify efficiency reserves and put a tighter lid 
on the cost of government services.31 However, 
transparency is also hampered by the fact that 
federal states are neither consistent nor strin -
gent in their application of harmonised ac -
counting rules. In addition, it would be useful if the federal states were to regularly update their 
plans in a standardised manner. Accordingly, 
the Stability Council remains tasked with ensur -
ing the states provide meaningful information 
and making such information publicly available 
in good time.

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.

portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity

2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.
8 Calculated as the sum of the “Deposit facility”, “Banknotes in circulation” and “Credit
institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from
2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from
2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
5 Euro area countries (current composition) and countries belonging to the extended
EER group of trading partners (fixed comosition).  6 Euro area countries (current compo-
