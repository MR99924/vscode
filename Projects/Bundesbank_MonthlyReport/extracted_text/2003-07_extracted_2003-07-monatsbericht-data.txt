Monatsbericht
July 2003
Last year the Bundesbank dedicated its spring
conference to the topic of foreign direct in-
vestment in the real and financial sector of
industrial countries. This conference was the
subject of an article in the June 2002 edition
of the Monthly Report. The conference papers
have been published in a one-volume book
which is now available at bookshops.
Heinz Herrmann and Robert Lipsey (eds)
Foreign Direct Investment in the Real andFinancial Sector of Industrial CountriesSpringer-Verlag, 2003
International economic integration is one of the major
issues of our time. This book contains articles on the deter-minants and effects of foreign direct investment in the realand financial sector of the industrial countries. These art-icles shed new light on the motives behind direct invest-ment, especially the role played by government incentives.Considerable attention is also devoted to the part playedby foreign direct investment in the acceding countries ofeastern Europe. The future impact of EU enlargement onthe flows of capital into these countries is discussed. Thedebate on international bank mergers has intensified sincethe start of European monetary union. Articles in the lastsection of the book deal with this subject.

ManufacturingThe situation in the manufacturing sector
clouded over markedly in May. Demand andproduction both failed to match the previousmonths’ results. In May, orders receiveddeclined by over 2% from their previousmonth’s levels after seasonal adjustment. Theresults for the two spring months of April andMay put together failed perceptibly to reachthe first quarter’s levels. Orders received werealso down from their level in the same periodof the previous year, by 3
14%; this contrasts
with a year-on-year rise of just over 1% in theaverage of the first three months of the year.
Export business, in particular, declined notice-
ably in recent months. In April-May orderswere nearly 3% lower after seasonal adjust-ment than in the first quarter and were downby 5
34% on the year. If one takes into ac-
count the fact that – like last December –days taken off to create long weekends mayhave likewise affected this period’s result, thedecline may be somewhat overstated from acyclical standpoint. Seasonally adjusted do-mestic demand largely held firm in May. Thecombined April-May figures, however, were1
14% lower than in the preceding three-
month period and were down by just over1% on the year.
Seasonally adjusted manufacturing output
continued its decline in May. Output had al-ready gone down in April, which meant thataverage output for the combined April-Mayperiod was down by 2% from its first-quarterOrders received

6level. There was still a year-on-year increase
of just over14%, yet the year-on-year in-
crease in the January-March period had been1
34%. The low level of output in May is prob-
ably attributable in part to employees taking“bridge” days off to create long weekends.Given the sluggishness of incoming orderflows, enterprises were probably not disap-pointed to see these holidays being taken.
ConstructionDevelopments in the construction industry re-
mained unfavourable throughout the report-ing period. Seasonally adjusted constructionoutput in May was down once again fromthe preceding months, in which the elimin-ation of winter weather-related disruptionshad had a positive impact. According to theavailable data, output in May, as in April, wasdown by just under 8% on the year. It is truethat the expected upward revision due to thecoming overall survey has not been takeninto account. However, even if the estimatedsurvey results are included, the outcome willstill be a distinct year-on-year decline.
Orders received by the construction industry,
figures for which are currently available upto April, largely held firm at the previousmonth’s levels after seasonal adjustment.They were well below the levels reached atthe beginning of the year, however. The de-cline of 13% from April 2002 levels was hard-ly lower than in previous periods.

go up slightly, public sector demand for con-struction has remained very muted.
Macroeconomic trendsCurrent indicators, which relate mainly to the
value added generation component of grossdomestic product (GDP), do not indicate thatQ2 aggregate output was able to break freeof the underlying stagnation trend. It is notlikely, though, that the economy will drift fur-ther into negative territory. After the elimin-ation of working-day variations, Q2 GDP isnot likely to have surpassed its previous year’slevel. There is no sign that the situation willimprove anytime soon.
Labour marketThe slumping economy has caused a re-
newed perceptible decline in employment. Asestimated by the Federal Statistical Office, thenumber of persons in work in April fell to aseasonally adjusted 38.27 million. The declinefrom April levels, at just under 50,000, washardly lower than in the previous period.The year-on-year decline increased to almost545,000 persons, or 1.4%. At the beginningof this year, the decline had been muchlower, in both absolute and relative terms.
All the same, the number of persons regis-
tered with the Federal Labour Office as un-employed fell in June to a seasonally adjusted4.41 million persons. That was nearly 45,000fewer than as late as the end of April. Theyear-on-year rise in unemployment deceler-ated to just over 300,000 following 470,000in April. The seasonally adjusted unemploy-
ment rate, as calculated by the Federal La-bour Office, was 10.6% at the end of theperiod under review. Using the internationallystandardised method, the figure was 9.4%.
The reduction in the number of persons
reported as unemployed, however, does notmean that the labour market situation hasimproved. This development is instead largelythe result of a revision of unemploymentstatistics as part of the reform launched bythe Hartz Commission. Among other things,stricter eligibility requirements were imposedfor registering as unemployed.
PricesThe rate of price increase picked up again a
bit in June. The year-on-year rate of con-sumer price increase using the national indexrose to 1.0% following 0.7% in May; accord-ing to the harmonised index it rose to 0.9%following 0.6%. Seasonal foods were onecontributing factor as the continued warmand dry weather reduced their supply. An-other factor was that the decline in the pricesof refined petroleum products was followedby renewed price increases. The change inthe prices for other goods and services andhousing rents, by contrast, remained withintight limits. The prices for industrial goodscontinued to rise negligibly on the year; inthe case of services, the rate of price increasein the past twelve months was only slightlyabove 1%.
As is usually the case, refined petroleum
prices reacted quickly to price rises on the

the price of a barrel of Brent North Sea oil riseto as much as US$28
14. This contrasted with
only around US$25 in April and May.
The low purchase prices for oil continued to
take the pressure off of import prices in May,the last month for which this informationis currently available. In addition, during theperiod under review the US dollar distinctlyfell against the euro. Therefore, importedgoods were 3.8% cheaper than one yearearlier. The year-on-year inflation rate for in-dustrial goods was 1.3% in June following1.7% for the first quarter of 2003.
Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
The combined indebtedness of central, state
and local government rose by 31.6 billion
in May, which was a relatively moderate in-crease compared with the preceding months.However, net borrowing was understated bythe fact that funds borrowed to repay a bondissued by the ERP Special Fund amounting to33.0 billion, which was redeemed at the be-
ginning of May, had already been taken upin April. The increase in the indebtedness ofcentral government (+ 31.7 billion) was chiefly
fuelled by the development of two-year Fed-eral Treasury notes (“Schätze”), the outstand-ing amount of which increased by 35.4 billion
on account of a reopening auction ( 34.1 bil-
lion) and sales from the market-smoothing re-serve. No redemptions were made. In add-ition, a net inflow of resources from Federal
bonds – Bunds ( 32.1 billion), five-year Federal
notes – Bobls ( 30.9 billion) and Treasury dis-
count paper – Bubills ( 30.5 billion) was ac-
companied by a decrease in the outstandingvolume of Federal savings notes ( 31.0 billion)
and bank loans ( 30.4 billion). Liabilities arising
from money market loans were reduced sub-stantially (- 35.7 billion).
Although net borrowing by state government
remained high in May at 32.8 billion, it de-
clined in comparison with the levels seensince the start of this year. The issue of treas-ury notes, with a volume of 33.7 billion gross
and 32.4 billion net, accounted for the bulk
of this new borrowing. The largest issue interms of amount was the Länder JumboNo 15 with a volume of 31.5 billion, whichNet borrowing in the market

9was jointly launched by seven state govern-
ments. It carries a 3.25% coupon and has amaturity of six years. State governments in-creased their bank loans by a total of 31.4 bil-
lion on balance, whereas they ran down theirshort-term cash advances by 31.2 billion. The
off-budget special funds reduced their in-debtedness by 33.2 billion owing to the
aforementioned time lag between new bor-rowing and redemption as well as the repay-ment of bank loans. Local governmentappears to have again marginally raised itsindebtedness in May.
Federal Government borrowingIn June, a month that generally registers high
tax revenue, net borrowing by the FederalGovernment totalled merely 30.6 billion.
Measured in gross terms, however, centralgovernment tapped the capital market for320.8 billion. But this influx of fresh resources
was largely cancelled out by massive redemp-tions ( 320.2 billion). The most significant indi-
vidual item of gross borrowing by central gov-ernment was the quarterly new issue ofSchätze, which brought in 36.2 billion. Com-
pared with the March 2003 issue, the couponwas trimmed by
12percentage point to 2%.
The 2001 issue redeemed in June had carrieda rate of interest of 4.25%. In net terms theoutstanding amount of these securities fellby33.0 billion. The volume of outstanding
Bunds declined by the same margin. Al-though 32.0 billion was raised from market-
smoothing operations, a bond issued by theTreuhand agency, remunerated at 6.875%,was concurrently redeemed ( 35.1 billion). A
reopened Bobl issue yielded 35.4 billion.After adding current sales, a total of 36.2 bil-
lion accrued to central government fromBobls. The monthly issue of Bubills amountingto34.5 billion was carried out at an average
yield of 1.91%, which was again noticeablydown on the previous month. There were nonoteworthy changes in the Federal Govern-ment’s money market indebtedness.
In the first half of 2003 the Federal Govern-
ment’s new borrowing in the market totalled324.4 billion; this was more than half as
much again as the comparable figure in thefirst half of 2002. It also substantially ex-ceeded the budgeted net borrowing require-ment for the whole of this year of not quite319 billion. It is, however, not possible to
infer from the trend so far the amount bywhich the annual budget target will eventual-Net borrowing in the market by the

10ly be exceeded and the adjustment that will
be required to the borrowing authorisation.Of the total net amount borrowed during thefirst half of the year, Bund sales accounted fora relatively modest portion at 35.6 billion on
balance. The bulk of new funds came frommedium-term borrowing in the form ofBobls, with a net inflow of 312.9 billion. A
much smaller contribution to the overall in-flux of funds was made by two-year Schätze,the outstanding volume of which rose by34.2 billion. The amount of Bubills in circula-
tion was virtually unchanged. The level of in-debtedness in the form of Federal savingsnotes declined by a further 33.6 billion to
merely 314.3 billion. Loans against borrow-
ers’ notes were repaid in the amount of 31.3
billion. Money market debt increased by 36.4
billion.
Securities markets
Bond marketIn May domestic borrowers issued bonds in
the German market to a market value of396.8 billion, ie somewhat more than in April
(389.9 billion). Redemptions and changes in
issuers’ holdings of their own bonds also in-creased slightly, leaving net sales at marketvalues ( 311.8 billion) at the level of the previ-
ous month ( 311.5 billion). Sales of foreign
bonds in the German market raised 36.4 bil-
lion net (April: 37.9 billion); the bulk of these
bonds were denominated in euro. Overall,net sales of domestic and foreign bonds yield-ed318.3 billion in May, somewhat down on
the April figure of 319.3 billion.In May credit institutions increased their
borrowing in the German bond market by34.4 billion, following a decrease of 31.5 bil-
lion in the previous month. They sold 34.5 bil-
lion (net) of public Pfandbriefe and 32.7 bil-
lion worth of debt securities issued by spe-cialised credit institutions. Net redemptions ofmortgage Pfandbriefe (- 30.7 billion) and
other bank bonds (- 32.1 billion) were record-
ed.
In May sales of corporate bonds ( 34.3 billion
net) maintained the previous month’s highlevel ( 34.4 bilion).
The public sector raised a relatively low
amount ( 33.2 billion) in the bond market
(April: 38.6 billion). The Federal Government
raised 33.0 billion net from bond sales. This
was offset by redemptions of the ERP SpecialFund amounting to 33.0 billion. The latter
borrower no longer issues paper on the bondmarket but acquires refinancing in conjunc-tion with the Federal Government. The Land
governments issued 32.9 billion worth of
bonds.
The main purchasers in the bond market in
May were non-resident investors, whichadded 312.1 billion worth of German bonds
to their portfolios. Bonds issued by privateborrowers accounted for over half of thisamount ( 36.6 billion). Domestic credit institu-
tions added 35.6 billion to their bond port-
folios and domestic non-banks added 30.5
billion. While banks invested primarily in do-mestic paper ( 34.9 billion), non-banks shifted
funds from domestic (- 35.2 billion) to foreign
paper ( 35.7 billion).

11Equity market
In May issuing activity in the German equity
market was, at 30.3 billion, well down on the
April figure ( 34.7 billion), although that de-
cidedly high figure was due to the equity in-crease by a major financial institution. At thesame time, foreign equities outstanding,which had declined by 312.2 billion in April,
increased by 34.1 billion. Domestic non-
banks were the main buyers in May, purchas-ing36.1 billion worth of shares. Credit insti-
tutions bought 31.1 billion of foreign equities
and sold 30.6 billion of domestic equities. On
balance, non-resident investors reduced theirportfolios of German shares by 32.3 billion.
Mutual fund sharesThe amount raised by domestic mutual funds
in May ( 34.9 billion) was roughly the same as
in April ( 34.6 billion).
1Specialised funds,
which are geared particularly to institutionalinvestors, attracted 33.0 billion (net) more in-
vestment than in the previous month ( 32.3
billion). By contrast, the resources accruing tofunds open to the general public decreasedfrom 32.3 billion in April to 31.8 billion in
May. More than two-thirds of these resourceswere channelled to open-end real estatefunds ( 31.3 billion). The volume of foreign
fund shares outstanding increased by 30.3
billion in May.
Balance of payments
In May, Germany’s current account ran a sur-
plus of 33.1 billion for the second month insuccession. This was due to an increase in the
trade surplus being almost entirely offset by alarger deficit on invisible current transactions,which is that part of the current accountcomprising services, factor income and cur-rent transfers.
According to figures from the Federal Statis-
tical Office, there was a month-on-month in-crease of 30.9 billion in the trade surplus
to310.1 billion in May. After the elimination
of seasonal influences the trade surplus in-Sales and purchases

12creased by 31 billion to 31012billion as the
exports of goods increased more sharply thanthe imports of goods. Exports in May grew bymore than 3
12% while imports exceeded
their level of the previous month by just over2%. However, the fact that the increase inthe value of imports was less than in the caseof exports was also due to the much morefavourable import prices. If March, April andMay are taken together, exports fell by a sea-sonally adjusted 2% compared with the pre-vious three-month period whereas importsdeclined only slightly (-
12%).
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents increased to 36.3 billion in
May compared with 35.2 billion in April. The
main reason for this was the 30.9 billion de-
cline in the balance of factor income to adeficit of 30.6 billion in May. Furthermore,
there was a month-on-month increase in thedeficit on services of 30.5 billion to 33.4 bil-
lion in May. By contrast, net expenditure oncurrent transfers declined to 32.4 billion in
May from 32.6 billion in the previous month.
In the field of portfolio transactions with non-
residents capital exports and imports virtuallycancelled out in May (- 30.3 billion) whereas
in April there had been net inflows of funds(310.4 billion). The main reason for this devel-
opment was that, after selling securities inearlier months ( 310.0 billion worth in March
and April taken together), German residentsinvested more heavily again in foreign paperin May ( 39.9 billion). In the case of dividend-
bearing paper, for example, German saversswitched from selling to buying ( 33.2 billion).

As in the previous few months, capital im-
ports (of 35.7 billion net) arose in the field of
direct investment in May. German enterpriseswithdrew capital from abroad ( 35.6 billion).
The bulk of this took the form of creditswhich subsidiaries and branches domiciledabroad were granting to their German parentcompanies (reverse flows). By contrast, for-eign proprietors made little change to their
direct investment in Germany ( 30.1 billion).
The non-securitised credit transactions of
non-banks with non-residents resulted in out-flows of funds in May ( 34.9 billion net). Enter-
prises and individuals accounted for 33.8 bil-
lion of this by, among other things, buildingup their balances with foreign banks whilegeneral government exported 31.0 billion.
The non-securitised external operations ofthe banking system were of greater signifi-cance in May. German credit institutions re-corded large outflows of funds ( 333.5 billion
net); these were partly offset by net capitalimports by the Bundesbank ( 323.5 billion),
which, as usual, arose primarily as a result ofthe payment system TARGET.
The foreign reserves of the Bundesbank rose –

cooperation between
the EU and the
acceding countries
following the
signature of the
accession treatyThe signature of the EU accession
treaty has lent added significance topreparations for full EU membership,including those concerning Europeaneconomic and monetary union. Hencecooperation will be further intensifiedin this last pre-accession stage and theacceding countries will have observerstatus at the meetings of the Union’sbodies, including those of the Euro-pean System of Central Banks (ESCB).
Progressive integration of the acceding
countries
After nearly five years of talks, accession ne-
gotiations between the EU and ten countries(Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hun-gary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slo-vak Republic and Slovenia) were concludedat the Copenhagen European Council in De-cember 2002. After the European Parliamenthad approved enlargement on 9 April 2003,the accession treaty was signed in Athens on16 April 2003. The accession of these coun-tries, which will increase the EU’s populationby some 75 million to around 450 millionpeople, is scheduled to take effect on 1 May2004.
1By that date, the accession treaty
must have been ratified by all current and ac-ceding member states pursuant to their na-tional laws and regulations. In addition, eachacceding country, excluding Cyprus, is hold-ing a referendum on accession. For the most

16part, the referenda held thus far have indi-
cated widespread support for accession. Theremaining referenda, in Estonia and Latvia,are scheduled for September 2003.
When enlargement takes effect on 1 May
2004, the acceding countries will be fully in-tegrated into the workings of the Commu-nity, although certain transitional arrange-ments will apply specifically to them. In par-ticular, they will participate in the single mar-ket and Community policies as well as in theCommunity’s financing system and institu-tions. Upon accession, acceding countries willimmediately join economic and monetaryunion (EMU), albeit as member states with aderogation pursuant to Article 122 of the ECTreaty. Once the formal conditions for acces-sion – signature and ratification of the acces-sion treaty – have been met, the materialconditions also have to be fulfilled prior tothe date of accession. The acceding countrieshave already fulfilled the political part of the1993 Copenhagen criteria. The EuropeanUnion expects the economic criteria (the ex-istence of a functioning market economy andthe ability to cope with competitive pressureand market forces) to have been fulfilled bythe time of accession and the acquis com-
munautaire to have been incorporated in its
entirety. Key tasks in this regard includestrengthening the administrative structuresand the court system as well as combatingcorruption and other forms of crime.
The signing of the treaty has already created
strong legal and political ties between the ac-ceding countries and the European Union.This also means that preparations to joinEMU and for the subsequent introduction of
the euro are acquiring added importance.The dialogue on macroeconomic and finan-cial stability launched in 2001 has been anoteworthy preparatory tool to this end, itsmost important element being the acces-sion countries’ pre-accession economic pro-grammes.
2In addition, the Eurosystem has
been holding regular high-level seminars withrepresentatives from the accession countries’central banks since 1999. Following the sig-nature of the accession treaty, cooperationnow has to be taken to the next level, mainlyby gradually involving these countries inthe coordination processes between memberstates and in intra-ESCB cooperation. In thiscontext, exchange rate issues – especially theconditions for and the date and modalities offuture participation in the exchange ratemechanism (ERM II)
3in the third stage of
EMU – are particularly high on the agenda.
In the last pre-accession stage, which was
launched upon signature of the accessiontreaty, the acceding countries are alreadybeing integrated into the workings of theCommunity and will have observer status atall levels of work in the EU.

– such as the General Council of theECB – these countries’ observer status willallow them to speak; however, observers arenot allowed to vote. The integration of acced-

17ing countries in the deliberations is designed
both to intensify cooperation in many fields,including EMU in particular, and to familiarisethese countries with their future tasks as fullmembers of the European Union. Now 162observers representing the ten countries at-tend the sessions of the European Parliamentand its committees; the number of observersmatches the number of members these coun-tries will send to the European Parliament inthe future under the terms of the accessiontreaty. Since the signature of the treaty, theacceding countries have also been invited toattend the meetings of the Council of Minis-ters and the European Council. The firstmeeting of the Council of Economic and Fi-nance Ministers (Ecofin Council) attended byobservers from the acceding countries tookplace on 13 May 2003. Following the sum-mer recess, the sessions of the Economic andFinancial Committee, the main task of whichis to prepare the meetings of the EcofinCouncil, will also be attended by observersfrom the acceding countries. Finally, since theend of June 2003 the meetings of the Gen-eral Council of the ECB have also been at-tended by the governors of the central banksof the future EU member states as observers.Acceding countries are also each entitled tosend one observer to those ECB committeeswhich meet in their extended composition (ieincluding representatives of the national cen-tral banks of the non-euro-area countries).The ESCB’s International Relations Commit-tee, in which the monetary aspects of en-largement are also discussed, is a particularlyimportant committee for the acceding coun-tries.Integration into economic policy
coordination
Along with their increasing integration into
the bodies and committees of the EU, theacceding countries will be gradually incorp-orated into the regular economic policy co-ordination procedures beginning in August2003. This process is scheduled for comple-tion by autumn 2004. The key stages includetaking the future member states into accountwhen formulating the broad economic policyguidelines – the core element of the EU’s eco-nomic policy coordination procedure – andthe employment policy guidelines in the con-text of the Luxembourg process. First, inJanuary 2004 the European Commission willadd an “acceding countries” section to itsspring report, in which it primarily indicatespolicy areas where progress is desirable, andin spring it will also present to the Council aguideline package containing recommenda-tions regarding the new member states’underlying economic policy orientations andtheir employment policies. This will allow theacceding countries to be included in theCommission’s January 2005 report on theimplementation of the broad economic policyguidelines.
Immediately following their accession to the
EU scheduled for 1 May 2004, the new mem-bers will present their first convergence pro-grammes under the Stability and GrowthPact. This rapid adoption of the budgetarymonitoring procedure is an important precon-dition for new member states to obtain ac-cess to financial resources from the EU’s Co-hesion Fund. The Commission can be expect-

18ed to open deficit procedures as early as sum-
mer 2004 against those countries whosebudget deficits are in excess of 3% of theirGDP in 2003. Under the rules of the Stabilityand Growth Pact, “excessive deficits” mustgenerally be corrected during the followingyear; however, acceding countries will prob-ably be given more time to correct their im-balances because of their specific circum-stances. As EU member states with a deroga-tion, they will also not be subject to sanc-tions. Between mid-October and early De-cember 2004 the new member states will,pursuant to the code of conduct on the for-mat and content of stability and convergenceprogrammes, join the current EU memberstates’ schedule and present “normal” pro-gramme updates, which the Council will thenuse to assess whether acceding countries’economic policy orientations are in line withthe recommendations in the broad economicpolicy guidelines and whether national fiscalpolicies are consistent with the rules of theStability and Growth Pact. The remainingaccession countries will also adapt theireconomic pre-accession programmes to thisschedule.
Moreover, acceding countries may voluntarily
present national reports on economic policyreform from as early as October 2003. At thebeginning of the following year they wouldthen be included in the “Cardiff Report“,which gives a detailed analysis of the waytheir goods and capital markets function andprovides the Commission with importantdata for its recommendations regarding thesingle market strategy. The aim of the Cardiffprocess is to promote economic growth andemployment through structural reform in the
goods and capital markets. The new mem-bers could then be involved at an early stagein the Lisbon strategy, the objective of whichis to make Europe the world’s most dynamicknowledge-based economic area by 2010.
The macroeconomic dialogue, also known as
the Cologne process, is a further initiativeintended to reduce unemployment. This in-volves an informal gathering, with a limitedoverall number of participants, of representa-tives of the governments of the EU memberstates, the European Commission, the ESCBand the social partners and is intended pri-marily to promote a confidence-building ex-change of views among economic policy-makers. From autumn 2003 the accedingcountries will be able to take part in this dia-logue as observers.
The role of the exchange rate
mechanism in the acceding countries’monetary integration
The EU distinguishes between three distinct
phases leading to the full monetary integra-tion of the acceding countries: the pre-acces-sion phase, the post-accession phase and thefinal phase beginning with the introductionof the euro. The EC Treaty does not allow theeuro to be introduced immediately: the intro-duction of the euro has to be preceded by apositive assessment of convergence, which inturn has to be preceded by two years ofmembership of ERM II without tension or de-valuation. This convergence assessment ad-dresses not only exchange rate stability but

19also the other criteria stipulated in the Treaty
relating to price stability, budget deficits, gov-ernment debt and long-term interest rates.
In this connection, a decision by a country to
“euroise”, ie to unilaterally adopt the euro asits legal tender before joining monetaryunion, would be unacceptable. This wouldcontradict the spirit of the Treaty, which holdsthat the introduction of the euro shouldcome at the end of a structured convergenceprocess. “Euroisation” is therefore not an ac-ceptable way of circumventing the multiplestages of the structured, multilateral processfor introducing the euro as provided for bythe Treaty. The EU’s view is that decisions onthe compatibility of existing currency boards,ie monetary systems where the money in cir-culation is completely backed by foreign re-serves, with ERM II have to be taken on acase-by-case basis. A currency board, how-ever, is not a substitute for the required twoyears of tension-free membership of ERM II.
In its report on the exchange rate aspects of
enlargement presented to the 2000 NiceEuropean Council, the Ecofin Council empha-sised that the same criteria governing the ini-tial members’ participation in EMU were tobe applied to the acceding countries. The re-port defined what the EU believes should bethe guiding principles behind the accedingcountries’ exchange rate policies. Upon ac-cession, the new member states are required,pursuant to Article 124 of the EC Treaty, totreat their exchange rate policies as a matterof common interest. In order for the singlemarket to function smoothly, competitive de-valuation is therefore not permitted. More-over, the acceding countries are expected to
join ERM II after acceding to the EU, althoughnot necessarily immediately. For this to hap-pen, the acceding country must submit anapplication and an agreement needs to havebeen reached on the central rate and the fluc-tuation margins.
Most of the acceding countries have already
declared their intention to join ERM II as soonas possible after acceding to the EU. From aneconomic perspective, this raises the questionas to the optimum point in time for them totake that step. The acceding countries are inthe middle of a complex process of trans-formation and adjustment; a high degree ofexchange rate flexibility may make the situ-ation easier to manage. That is particularlythe case for those countries which have onlyrecently liberalised their exchange rate re-gimes to obtain greater freedom of action ineconomic policy. Careful consideration shouldtherefore be given to the timing of their join-ing ERM II. Further progress in economic con-vergence and exchange rate stabilisation firstneeds to be achieved.
Once an acceding country has already made
enough progress in convergence to justify itsjoining ERM II, membership of the exchangerate mechanism should not be understood asa “waiting room” before the euro is intro-duced as swiftly as possible. The requirementof two years of tension-free membership ofERM II without any devaluation is naturallythe key criterion in the Treaty for assessing ex-change rate stability. However, membershipof ERM II is also a distinct stage in monetarypolicy convergence. ERM II is an exchange

It can lend considerable support to the acced-ing countries’ convergence process by meansof focusing on an exchange rate target, yet itsimultaneously affords sufficient flexibility be-
cause it accommodates the option of adjust-ing exchange rates.

21The state of public
finance in the EU
acceding countriesUpon their accession to the European
Union on 1 May 2004, the ten newmember states will also take over theEU’s fiscal policy framework, in particu-lar the provisions on budgetary discip-line. Although nine acceding countriesare currently below the debt ceiling of60% of gross domestic product (GDP)laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, theacceding countries’ budget deficits arefor the most part still well above theceiling of 3% of GDP. The fiscal policysituation varies considerably across theindividual acceding countries: whilst itappears to be relatively favourable inthe Baltic states and in Slovenia, theother countries still have to make con-siderable progress towards consolida-tion.
This article outlines the current situ-
ation of public budgets in the accedingcountries and examines aspects of thelong-term sustainability of their fiscalposition. The combination of structuralreforms and continuing high economicgrowth may help to lastingly solve theacceding countries’ budgetary prob-lems, some of which are quite consid-erable. In this respect, the fiscal effectsof accession, above all the financiallinkage to the EU budget, are likely tohave positive consequences. However,they cannot be precisely gauged atpresent.

22Adoption of the fiscal policy framework
Following accession to the European Union
on 1 May 2004, the ten new member stateswill, in principle, have the same contractualrights and duties as the existing memberstates. They will, therefore, be incorporatedinto the EU’s fiscal policy framework, whichin particular contains the obligation to avoidexcessive government deficits (Article 104 (1)of the Treaty establishing the European Com-munity). For member states which have notyet joined the monetary union (such as Den-mark, Sweden and the United Kingdom atpresent), however, continued violation of thisrequirement will not entail sanctions. The fur-ther requirements to be complied with, whichare laid down in the Stability and GrowthPact (SGP), notably include the obligation toachieve a budgetary position in the mediumterm which is close to balance or in surplus.Moreover, convergence programmes are tobe submitted for the purpose of budgetarysurveillance. These are to be updated annual-ly and are to outline the measures planned toachieve the budgetary targets. As the precur-sor to the convergence programmes, the ac-ceding countries submitted programmes inpreparation for EU accession (Pre-accessionEconomic Programmes or “PEPs” for short)to the European Commission for the secondtime in August 2002. They are part of thepre-accession fiscal surveillance procedure,which was initiated in spring 2001. The aim isto strengthen the technical, statistical, institu-tional and analytical capacities within eachcountry as well as to promote the economicdialogue with the EU member states.
1Instead
of filing notifications on their deficit and debtlevels on a compulsory twice-yearly basis as
the EU member states do, the acceding coun-tries have hitherto submitted reports annuallyon 1 April.
2
The acceding countries will not join the euroarea until they meet all the convergence cri-teria. These include a sustainable governmentfinancial position, which will be apparentfrom a situation without an excessive deficit(Art 121 (1) of the Treaty establishing theEuropean Community). As a rule, this requiresa maximum deficit ratio of 3% and a max-imum debt ratio of 60%. Sound public fi-nance is, therefore, an essential prerequisitefor participation in monetary union. This iseven more important when seen in the lightof other factors. Thus fiscal discipline is notonly crucial for ensuring stable prices but isalso important for achieving a sustainablecurrent account balance.
Compliance with the Maastricht criteria
Last year, the deficit ratios of the acceding
countries – except for the Baltic states andSlovenia – exceeded the 3% ceiling (see thechart on page 23).

the fiscal surveillance procedure. The corresponding stat-
istical reporting systems are still under construction in the
acceding countries. Despite constant improvements, the

sion (although this is also partly the case for existing
member states).Duties of the

23ticularly high in Hungary (9.1%) and in the
Slovak Republic (7.2%). Marked differencesare apparent in the developments in the vari-ous countries in recent years.
The Baltic states, whose deficits had in-
creased significantly in 1999 – in particularowing to the crisis in Russia – made consider-able progress towards consolidation in thesubsequent years. Estonia actually recorded ageneral government surplus of 1.3% of GDPin 2002. This was attributable not least tohigh real economic growth (around 6% inthe Baltic states in 2002 compared with2
12% on average for the acceding countries
as a whole). This favourable developmentshows that – contrary to occasionally ex-pressed fears – fulfilment of the provisions ofthe Maastricht Treaty and the SGP certainly iscompatible with a high economic growthrate. The budgetary situation in Slovenia isalso relatively favourable. The deficit in 2002was well below 3% of GDP , whereas it hadslightly exceeded this level in 2000.
By contrast, the budget deficit ratio in Poland
– which is by far the most populous accedingcountry – increased in 2002 for the third yearin succession to just over 4%. A sharp in-crease in expenditure was accompanied by adisappointing revenue trend due to a markedslowdown in the pace of economic growth.Hungary managed to reduce its deficit ratioto 3% by 2000, but then saw it rise dramatic-ally, above all on account of a surge in ex-penditure. At 9.1%, it had the highest deficitratio of all the acceding countries in 2002.Much of the jump in the deficit was attribut-able to exceptional factors, such as the statis-tical incorporation of off-budget special
funds showing large deficits. Moreover, therewere major increases in public sector wagesand pension benefits, which the governmentelected last year had promised to implementif it gained office.
The Czech Republic and especially the Slovak

247.2% respectively). The budgetary position in
both countries has for some years been con-siderably burdened by restructuring measuresdesigned to tackle profound crises in thebanking sector.
4The measures are being
financed largely by privatisation proceeds,which are not reflected in the deficits as de-fined in the national accounts, although theyare reducing the government gross debt.
The two Mediterranean countries Cyprus and
Malta are very much economically dependenton tourism. The negative developments inthis sector owing to international crisesaffected public finance above all throughshortfalls in tax revenue, especially in Cyprus.Owing to weak growth in 2002, the deficitratio in Cyprus – which along with Sloveniagenerates the highest per capita income of allthe acceding countries (see table on page 32)– increased from 3% to 3.5%. Although thebudget deficit in Malta has declined sharplyin recent years, it still amounted to around6% of GDP in 2002.
According to the medium-term plans set out
in the PEPs, all of the acceding countries ex-cept for the Czech Republic and Malta aim toachieve a deficit ratio which is below the 3%ceiling by 2005 (see table on page 25). Thisimplies an ambitious consolidation policy forthe “high-deficit countries” Hungary, theSlovak Republic and Malta (which plans a re-duction to 3.1%). The plans in these coun-tries envisage a reduction in the deficit ratioof more than 2 percentage points in compari-son with the goals specified in the PEPs for2002. However, in these countries in particu-lar the actual deficit in 2002 was substantiallyhigher than anticipated, which means that
considerably greater consolidation efforts willbe required in order to reach the 3% ceiling.The problem is compounded by the fact thatthe average real growth rates assumed forthe period from 2002 to 2005 were, as thingsstand today – measured in terms of the Euro-pean Commission’s expectations – overly op-timistic, above all in the case of Hungary.
The consolidation task is easier for Poland in
that the deficit reduction can commencefrom a far lower level. In this country, thesluggishness of economic activity over thepast two years (with annual real GDP growthat around 1%) constitutes a particular prob-lem. Much the same is true for Cyprus. TheBaltic states and Slovenia, where the deficitratio is already below 3%, should focus theirplans on achieving a balanced budget in themedium term. The Czech Republic is the onlyhigh-deficit country which is not planning tosizeably reduce its deficit, which is envisagedto amount to 5
12% of GDP in 2005.
The necessary consolidation measures are
even more ambitious in that they are to beimplemented predominantly on the expend-iture side. There is only limited scope on therevenue side in view of the existing levy bur-den. Furthermore, several acceding countriesare endeavouring to introduce attractive taxregimes with low tax rates; despite the posi-tive supply-side effects expected in the me-dium to long term, this is likely to lead to rev-enue shortfalls in the short run.

25government recently decided to introduce a
flat-rate income tax of 19% for both individ-uals and corporate entities as of 2004, al-though this is to be counter-financed by anincrease in excise taxes. A “flat tax” is alsobeing discussed in Poland.
In principle, government debt is a reflection
of past budget balances. However, other de-terminants are also of considerable signifi-cance, especially for the new member states.Privatisation transactions, which play a majorrole there, are shown in the national accountsas not affecting the deficit, although they dohave a dampening impact on the gross debt.On the other hand, the assumption of debt,for example in the wake of restructuring thebanking system, or the allocation of enter-prises to the government sector push up thenational debt without this necessarily being
reflected as an increase in the deficit as de-fined in the national accounts. However,these so-called financial transactions willprobably diminish in the years to come as, inparticular, the potential for selling enterprisesis shrinking constantly. Fluctuations in thedebt ratio are also caused by valuation adjust-ments wherever the government debt hasbeen incurred in foreign currency. In Poland,the appreciation of the zloty in 2001 was amajor reason why the increase in indebted-ness was smaller than the general govern-ment fiscal balance had suggested it wouldbe. In 2002, the devaluation of the zloty hadthe opposite effect on the debt level. The ac-ceding countries show a mixed picture withregard to borrowing in foreign currency.

26states is denominated primarily in foreign cur-
rency, while the Czech Republic has for sometime issued bonds only in the domestic cur-rency.
The acceding countries’ debt ratios present a
much more favourable picture than do theirdeficit ratios. Except for Malta, all of thecountries are below the 60% limit – some ofthem considerably so (see chart on this page),although Hungary and Cyprus are only just
below this level. As in the case of the budgetdeficits, the Baltic countries, which did nothave any debt when their independence wasre-established, are at the lower end of thespectrum. Whilst all of the other countriesshowed more or less constant debt ratios inthe last four years, the debt ratio in theCzech Republic has increased sharply, aboveall as a result of the aforementioned deter-minants that are of no relevance for the def-icit ratio.
Fiscal sustainability endangered in
some cases
Although the evolution of the deficit and debt
ratios projected in the respective countries’medium-term financial plans for the yearsahead provides important indications ofpossible progress towards convergence, theprojected development – as in the currentEU countries – is strongly dependent on theunderlying macroeconomic assumptions andon anticipated but often not yet adopted fiscalprojects. The available plans should thereforebe supplemented with more fundamental con-siderations on whether the present fiscal situ-ation in the acceding countries is sustainable.
The generally applicable principle is the so-
called intertemporal government budget con-straint, ie the requirement that future govern-ment revenue and expenditure, discounted tothe present over an infinite time-horizon,must balance. However, the long-term re-quirement for government expenditure andrevenue to match can be neutralised for par-As % of GDP

through borrowing. The degree of fiscal sus-tainability can therefore be derived from thelevel and expected development of a coun-try’s debt ratio.
Clearly, a permanently rising debt ratio can-
not be financed because, after it has reacheda certain level, either the country’s limitedeconomic capability will prove an intractableobstacle or the political readiness to providethe necessary resources will be lacking. Ac-cordingly, whether a country’s fiscal andmacroeconomic conditions are such that thegeneral government debt ratio remains con-stant or converges towards a desired value isconsidered a general indicator of fiscal sus-tainability. A standard approach to answeringthis question is to simply extrapolate the sta-tus quo, which indeed can provide a certainindication of whether or not fiscal sustainabil-ity has been attained. This is, however, only arough initial estimate as the current fiscal situ-ation and the macroeconomic conditions canalter significantly in the future even without achange in policy. Thus demographic develop-ments, in particular, can lead to considerableshifts in government revenue and expend-iture ratios. Other variables such as interestrates and growth rates may also be subject tostructural changes in the long term.
European legislation has provided a political
definition of sustainability. The provision inthe Maastricht Treaty limiting the deficit andthe debt ratios to, as a rule, a maximum of3% and 60%, respectively, as well as the fur-ther-going objective set out in the SGP ofachieving a budgetary position that is at leastclose to balance in the medium term contrib-
ute substantially to permanently ensuring fis-cal sustainability. This averts the danger of asovereign default. The possibility that monet-ary policymakers or other member stateshave to intervene in order to contain thenegative spill-over of unsound public financeor even a solvency crisis was a major reasonwhy the fiscal discipline requirement was en-shrined in the Maastricht Treaty.
As shown in the synoptic table on page 28,
the development of the debt ratio is depend-ent not only on the primary balance, (ie thedifference between revenue and expenditureexcluding interest payments), but also on therate of macroeconomic growth and the inter-est rate level. When analysing this overall pat-tern of debt dynamics, the actual primary bal-ance is often compared with the primary bal-ance that would be needed to stabilise thecurrent debt ratio or to reach a specified tar-get within a certain period. The difference be-tween the two balances (expressed as a per-centage of GDP) is termed the “primarybudget gap” and shows to what extent rev-enue and expenditure, which in principle canbe altered by policy measures, have to be ad-justed in order to attain the desired debtpath. Analyses of the overall pattern of debtdynamics played a major role, too, in assess-ing the fiscal convergence of the currenteuro-area countries in 1998.

28If one assumes that the interest rate level and
nominal GDP growth remained unaltered inthe individual acceding countries on averagefrom 1999 to 2002, considerable differencesare apparent in most of the countries be-tween the primary balance needed to stabil-ise the debt ratio and the actual primary bal-ance (see chart on page 29). The Czech Re-public, Hungary and the Slovak Republicwould need to improve their budgetary pos-ition by more than 3% of GDP in order to sta-bilise their debt ratios. Conversely, Lithuania,Estonia and Cyprus already show “positiveprimary budget gaps” under status quo con-ditions.
The development of the debt ratio presents a
similar picture if no consolidation is assumed,ie if the primary balance for 2002 remains un-altered (see table on page 30). If the averageGDP growth for the period from 1999 to2002 is taken as a basis, the debt ratio in theaforementioned countries with large primarybudget gaps would, in some cases, rise wellabove the 60% ceiling by 2015. By contrast,Estonia could build up net wealth.
However, it cannot be assumed that the
present macroeconomic conditions in the ac-ceding countries – which, in contrast to thecurrent euro-area countries, are mostly char-acterised by relatively high growth rates andinterest rate levels – will remain unchangedduring the adjustment process. Instead, con-vergence with the “old EMU” level is to beexpected in the medium to long term. In asecond scenario, therefore, the average for allthe current member countries from 1999 to2002 is used as a rough approximation forThe debt ratio and its determinants

In this equation, b t(bt-1) is the share of GDP represented

29the new member states with regard to overall
economic growth and the interest rate level.
If, applying these macroeconomic constraints,
unchanged primary balances are assumed inthe acceding countries from 2002, the debtratio in four countries (the Slovak Republic,Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus) would developmore favourably up to 2015 than if the na-tional interest rate level and the average GDPgrowth rate for the period from 1999 to2002 are extrapolated. Cyprus’ debt ratiowould actually decrease significantly. Themain reason for the more favourable develop-ment is that the current situation in thesecountries is characterised by a relatively highrate of interest on government debt in rela-tion to overall economic growth. However,this ratio is, as a rule, much more favourableunder EMU conditions, which means that
these countries would gain particularly fromthe expected convergence.
By contrast, the remaining six acceding coun-
tries would face a more rapidly growing debtratio under the EMU scenario. This – given theacross-the-board negative primary balances –is due to the less favourable interest rate/growth constellations: at present, the GDPgrowth rates are higher than the interestrates, whereas the opposite would be thecase in the EMU scenario. All in all, the pro-jections show no clear trend in the transitionto EMU conditions. The debt ratios would de-velop less favourably in most of the accedingcountries. By contrast, there would be amarked improvement in some countries. It isto be expected, however, that the interestAs % of GDP

relatively quickly in the process of con-vergence, while growth rates are likely toremain considerably higher over the longerterm. In this respect, the EMU scenariodescribed here presents an overly unfavour-able picture of the development of the debtratios.
Exemption from Stability and
Growth Pact rules not advisable
EU legislation, which is oriented towards a
sustainable public finance position, is oftencriticised for being too inflexible. Against thisbackground, there have been occasionalcalls, subject to certain conditions, to relaxthe fiscal discipline requirement for the ac-ceding countries – at least for a certain time.
These advocates of relaxing the rules arguethat a certain structural deficit would be tol-erable as, given the low debt ratio in most ofthe new member states and the high nominaleconomic growth, the 60% ceiling is unlikelyto be breached even in the longer term. Fur-thermore, they argue that the acceding coun-tries need to vastly expand their infrastruc-tures, especially in the public domain, andthat this could be debt-financed, at least inpart.
There are legal reasons but also other import-
ant arguments for not allowing exemptionsfrom the Pact. The SGP provides uniform,Development of debt ratios with varying interest rate and growth assumptions

laxation of the rules in individual cases wouldrun counter to these fundamental principlesand would compromise, in particular, theconfidence placed in the ongoing validity ofthese rules and consequently in a sound fiscalpolicy in the future. Given that fiscal and eco-nomic policies remain largely a matter of na-tional sovereignty, this would lead to a blur-ring of responsibilities. Special treatment inapplying the SGP would undermine the cred-ibility of the legislative framework and shouldbe rejected.
Furthermore, there are also economic argu-
ments against granting the acceding coun-tries special treatment. The SGP’s medium-term budgetary objective is intended,amongst other things, to ensure that the 3%ceiling laid down in the Maastricht Treaty canbe maintained even during periods of eco-nomic weakness (safety margin for cyclicalfluctuations). Almost all of the accedingcountries have small open economies whosedynamic growth in recent years has beenprincipally characterised by substantial for-eign direct investment and the possibility ofvirtually unhindered exports to the EU. Exter-nal shocks are likely to lead to relativelysevere output fluctuations and, given the sen-sitivity of public finance to cyclical fluctu-ations – which is not very different from thesituation in the current EU member states
7–
to the triggering of the automatic stabilisers.It therefore follows that the safety margin formaintaining the 3% ceiling should at leastnot be curtailed.Furthermore, although the budgetary conse-
quences of the demographic change in theacceding countries are likely to become no-ticeable somewhat later, they will in principlebe similar to those in the current EU coun-tries. The birth rates (children per female) areconsiderably lower than those required tokeep the population at a constant level and(apart from in Malta and Cyprus) are alsobelow the EU average of just under 1.5.

Although the age structure is generally stillmore favourable than in the EU (in the senseof a lower average age), this does not affectthe long-term trend towards an ageing anddeclining population. A rapidly increasinglevel of indebtedness in the coming yearswould make it very difficult to cope withthese problems in terms of fiscal policy.
However, some of the acceding countries
have already adopted far-reaching reformmeasures in order to limit the additional bur-dens of unfunded statutory pension andhealth systems. Extensive reforms have beenset in train in Poland and Hungary. Besidespartly decoupling pension adjustments fromwage growth, these reforms also include theintroduction of a funded pension component.By contrast, there is still a considerable needfor action, for example, in the Czech Repub-lic, although further reforms, such as decoup-

As far as financing the substantial investment
requirements is concerned, the structure andsize of the government budgets in the acced-ing countries suggest that it would be wiserto shift the emphasis of expenditure fromconsumption to investment rather than toopt for a deficit-boosting increase in overallexpenditure (see chart on page 34). The aver-age government expenditure ratio in the newmember states in 2001 exceeded 46% andthus virtually matched the EU level (47%), al-though the government expenditure ratiotypically correlates positively with a country’slevel of economic development – and percapita GDP in the acceding countries (meas-ured in purchasing power standards) is only45% of the EU level. There are also only
minor differences between the accedingcountries and the EU average with regard tothe structure of government expenditure, es-pecially the large share of social transfers.Moreover, it should be borne in mind that theextensive cofinancing of investment by theEU limits the acceding countries’ additionalfinancing requirements for developing theirinfrastructure.

34need to be taken into account, however.9On
the expenditure side, the new member coun-tries will firstly have to contribute around 1%of their GDP towards financing the EUbudget. Furthermore, additional expenditurewill be required to comply with the EU’s legalstandards, for example in the field of environ-mental protection. On the other hand, theEU’s agricultural subsidies will replace the cor-responding national payments. Moreover,subsidies in other areas will also have to beabolished if they conflict with the EU’s ruleson state aid.
As the sizeable agricultural subsidies flow
from the EU budget directly to the beneficiar-ies, transfers from the Structural Funds andthe Cohesion Fund are the most importantitems of government revenue from EU re-sources. However, these payments are gov-erned by the cofinancing principle, whichlimits the subsidy from the Structural Fundsto, as a rule, 75% of the investment volume.In addition, the principle of additionality is ap-plied, whereby ongoing investment projectsare excluded from assistance. The maximumamount available from structural assistancemeasures is limited to 4% of the recipientcountry’s GDP . The extent to which this ceil-ing is actually reached depends on the ab-sorption capacity, ie not only must a countryhave sufficient projects which fulfil the eligi-bility criteria, it must also develop administra-tive capacities to implement the programmes.The very limited use which the accedingcountries have made so far of pre-accessionaid, which they receive through the PHARE(institution building), ISPA (environmental andtransport projects) and SAPARD (structuralmeasures for the agricultural sector) pro-
grammes, is an indication of deficiencies inthis area. It is thus to be expected that thefunding possibilities will be exhausted onlygradually.
Furthermore, additional revenue will be gen-
erated through the need to harmonise certainindirect taxes, especially in the energy sector.By contrast, revenue shortfalls will result fromthe adoption of the EU’s tariff regime.
These direct revenue and expenditure effects
will be accompanied by indirect fiscal effectsif accession to the EU per se boosts economic
growth, thus leading to higher tax receipts.Lower interest costs for servicing the govern-ment debt as a result of reduced risk premiashould also be mentioned. However, the ex-pected accession to the EU and even theintroduction of the euro have already beenpartly factored into interest rates on the cap-ital markets.
When assessing the extent of the aforemen-
tioned payment streams and the resultingstrains or relief for the acceding countries’ fis-cal positions, a distinction should be madebetween the short and the long term. Beforeconcluding the accession negotiations, theEuropean Summit in Copenhagen agreed inDecember 2002 on a corresponding adjust-ment of the financial perspective up to 2006,covering the period from 2004 to 2006,which lays down binding expenditure limits

35The financing of enlargement
Agreement on the integration of the acced-
ing countries into the EU’s financial oper-ations was a major political prerequisite forthe signing of the accession treaties. Follow-ing lengthy negotiations, a corresponding de-cision was reached at the European Summitin Copenhagen in December 2002 and en-shrined in the Act of Accession signed inAthens on 16 April. On 9 April, the EuropeanParliament adopted a decision for the neces-sary adjustment of the financial perspectivewhich lays down the EU’s binding expend-iture ceilings for the period from 2000 to2006.
From 2004 to 2006, 541.4 billion in total will
be available to the acceding countries in theexpenditure categories agriculture, structuralactions, internal policies and administration(these and all further details at 2004 prices). Ifa political settlement is reached on the Cyprusissue, 5300 million in additional funds will be
made available. Transfer payments will beprovided within the limits of the expenditureceilings agreed at the Berlin Summit in 1999,which were in fact slightly undershot eventhough, at that time, the calculation wasbased on enlargement by only six new mem-bers (see table on page 36). The aforemen-tioned amount concerns commitment appro-priations, of which only a part is actually likelyto be paid out within the time-frame in ques-tion. As the new member countries will haveto contribute to financing the EU’s total ex-penditure – mostly in proportion to theirgross national income – as soon as they jointhe EU on 1 May 2004, there was a risk thatsome of the acceding countries would havebecome net contributors to the EU budgetand remained so for several years. In order tocounter this, a new expenditure item entitled“Compensation” was created, from whichlump-sum payments totalling 53.7 billion will
be made to the acceding countries up to2006. According to initial estimates, therecould be a total net transfer of around 515
billion to the acceding countries from 2004 to2006, which would correspond to 1% of theirGDP in this period. This figure will probablyincrease continuously in subsequent years.Firstly, the actual number of drawdowns of
appropriations will rise once action financedas part of structural assistance measuresstarts. Furthermore, direct payments to agri-cultural holdings will increase gradually from25% of the comparable EU level in 2004 to100% in 2013. However, at the moment it isvirtually impossible to forecast whether and,if so, when the level of up to almost 5% ofGDP recorded in the past for the existing netrecipients in the EU will be reached. This willdepend on both the absorption capacity ofthe new member states and the overall ex-penditure framework for the next financialperspective, which is still to be decided.
The reason given for the progressive introduc-
tion of direct payments to farmers over a ten-year period is that the immediate introduc-tion of payments in full would leave the cur-rent structures unaltered and provide hardlyany incentives for modernisation owing tothe large income transfer. The new memberstates were able to negotiate an improve-ment for their agricultural producers in thatthey may considerably top up the direct pay-ments with appropriations earmarked forrural development and national funds.
Almost two-fifths of the appropriations for
“Internal policies” take the form of tempor-ary financial assistance intended to helpthe acceding countries in implementing theSchengen acquis, in the field of nuclear safety
and in building up administrative capacities.Upon accession, the countries in question willno longer have the option of new expend-iture commitments as part of pre-accessionaid. The ceiling for this expenditure category,which is to be renamed “Pre-accession strat-egy”, will be maintained, however. In future,it will incorporate the expenditure for the ac-cession countries Bulgaria and Romania aswell as pre-accession aid for accession candi-date Turkey. This expenditure is to be boostedsignificantly. In principle, this budgetedamount also provides scope to supportfurther countries or rather possible future ap-plicant countries.

ensure that the acceding countries do not be-come net contributors to the EU budget –which would otherwise have been the case,given the fact that payments from the Struc-tural Funds will flow only gradually (see boxon page 35).
Assuming that the EU’s structural policy will
remain largely unchanged after 2006, consid-erable assistance from the EU budget for in-vestment projects in the acceding countries isto be expected in the medium to long term.The extent of this assistance will be defined inthe next financial perspective, which willprobably cover the financial years 2007 to2013 and is likely to take into account the ac-cession of Romania and Bulgaria. The ques-tion of how the available resources are to bedistributed will doubtless be the subject of in-
tense struggles during the consultation pro-cess. The new member states’ claims must besatisfied within a parallelogram of forces inwhich, on the one hand, the net contributorsare seeking to limit their financial burdenand, on the other, the current principal bene-ficiaries of structural assistance are trying toretain their existing level of aid. The focus ofstructural assistance at present is on helping“regions whose development is lagging be-hind” (Objective 1 areas). This includes re-gions whose per capita GDP – expressed inpurchasing power standards – is less than75% of the EU average. As the per capitaGDP of all the acceding countries falls signifi-cantly short of the EU average at both nation-al and regional level, the EU’s “new” averageper capita GDP will be around 10% lower.EU enlargement in the financial perspective (2000-06)

37Owing to this statistical effect alone, a large
number of the present Objective 1 areaswould no longer be eligible for assistance.
One financing possibility to support the con-
vergence process of the new member stateslies in reforming or reducing the agriculturalsubsidies, which account for almost half ofthe EU budget. The reform of the CommonAgricultural Policy (CAP), which was initiatedby the European Commission and has nowbeen set in motion by a decision of the Coun-cil of Ministers, aims to decouple aid from ac-tual production. It may be possible to avoid
the existing cost-driving tendency towardsoverproduction by concentrating aid on directpayments unconnected with productionlevels or surface areas. At the moment, how-ever, it is uncertain whether the reform nowagreed upon in principle will not only poten-tially eliminate market-distorting effects butalso provide significant relief for European taxpayers. The agricultural subsidies have alreadybeen fixed at the 2006 level (with an annual1% adjustment for inflation) up to 2013.

European countries
before accession
to the EUIn May of next year, ten countries, in-
cluding eight from central and easternEurope, are scheduled to join the Euro-pean Union. Whereas Malta and Cy-prus look back on a long market econ-omy tradition, the central and eastEuropean economies underwent a pro-found restructuring in the 1990s. In thepast few years, all eight countries havemade significant progress in the areasof bank consolidation and the inter-national integration of their financialmarkets. Compared to the euro area,however, there are still major struc-tural differences in the financial sec-tors, which suggests that further ad-justment is needed. The degree of inte-gration of the central and east Euro-pean financial markets with those ofthe euro area is also below the level ofintegration witnessed among the mar-kets of existing countries participatingin European economic and monetaryunion. Owing to the major importanceof integrated financial markets for im-plementing a common monetary pol-icy, further progress is necessary in thisarea before these countries can takethe next step and accede to Europeanmonetary union. This report analysesthe development of the financial mar-kets in the central and east Europeanacceding countries and also takes alook at their integration into the euroarea.

40Development and structure of the
financial sectors
The prerequisite of having an efficient and
competitive financial sector for joining theEuropean Union arose, technically, in 1993from the criteria which the CopenhagenEuropean Council set for new members ofthe European Union. These include “the exist-ence of a functioning market economy aswell as the capacity to cope with competitivepressure and market forces within theUnion.” With respect to the financial sector,the most important requirements are a sys-tem of efficient financial intermediation, asufficient equity capital base for banks as wellas satisfactorily functioning supervisory sys-tems. In addition, the criterion to incorporatetheaquis communautaire places great de-
mands, especially of an institutional kind, onthe banking system and on the stability of thefinancial markets.
Moreover, an efficient financial sector sup-
ports both the nominal and real convergenceof the acceding countries vis-à-vis the euroarea. First, an efficient financial sector formsthe link between the central bank and thereal economy, playing an essential part in thetransmission of monetary policy measures.Thus, a market-economy-oriented financialsector becomes an integral part of a stablemonetary environment. Second, empiricalstudies on the new growth theory indicate astrong correlation between the functional via-bility of a country’s domestic financial mar-kets and real economic development.
1A healthy and functionally viable financialsector is therefore indispensable for fulfillingthe “convergence criteria” laid down in Art-icle 121 of the EC Treaty, according to whichthe European Commission and the ECB regu-larly evaluate the fitness of the so-called pre-ins to participate in the Eurosystem. Aboveall, an efficient and stable banking system fa-cilitates the fulfilment of the inflation andinterest-rate criteria.
Even though the financial markets in central
and east European acceding countries satisfythe formal criteria for acceptance into the EU,they still have a long way to go in terms ofas a percentage of GDP (2002)

41size and liquidity despite enormous reform ef-
forts in the past few years. The rudimentaryinstitutional structures in place at the begin-ning of the transformation process have beenconsiderably strengthened and expanded inline with market economy criteria, but furtheradjustments towards the reference markets inthe euro area are necessary. If one considersthe ratio of commercial banks’ domestic lend-ing or the degree of stock-market capitalisa-tion to gross domestic product (GDP), it be-comes evident that in 2002 these variables,with the exception of the relatively largestock-market capitalisation in Estonia, wereconsiderably less than half the correspondinglevels in the euro area.
The existing differences become even more
apparent if account is taken of the fact thatin 2002 per capita economic output rangedfrom only 16% (Latvia) to 48% (Slovenia) ofthe EU average. Measured in terms of pur-chasing power parities, these figures increaseto between 35% and 74% of the EU aver-age. Even so, this gap in real convergence im-plies a considerable need for adjustment withrespect to the hitherto insufficient financialintermediation system in the central and eastEuropean financial markets if the desiredcatching-up process in the real economy is tomaterialise.
Despite the prominent role played by com-
mercial banks in the financial sector, their rolein financial intermediation lags significantlybehind that of commercial banks in the euroarea. If any country achieved a ratio of bankdeposits to GDP that was similar to that ofthe euro area in 2002, it was the CzechRepublic; domestic loans to the private sector
in relation to GDP lagged even further behindthe reference value in the euro area. This re-sults in considerable restrictions on financinginvestment. This problem can be partially off-set through foreign loans or direct invest-ments; however, this option is rarely availableto small and medium-size enterprises.
Most of the acceding countries have demon-
strated remarkable success in the privatisationof the commercial banking sector in the pastfew years. In all these countries more thanhalf of bank assets are now held by commer-cial banks, the majority of which are privatelyowned. The average figure is actually over85%. Given the considerable degree of pri-vate sector activity in the banking sector, itcan be assumed that the privatisation process

42in most of the central and east European ac-
ceding countries is largely complete.
The role played by foreign investors among
new shareholders deserves special mention.With the exception of Slovenia, which pro-tected its domestic financial sector from ex-ternal influences for a long time and did notstart to privatise the most important financialinstitutions until May 2001, the accedingcountries pursued a consistent strategy of im-porting foreign expertise and capital. In thesecountries the share of bank assets owned bycommercial banks that were predominantly inforeign hands steadily increased; at the endof 2001 this share was over 60%. In the lightof the upcoming accession to the EU, thegeographical proximity and legislation thatwas becoming increasingly EU compatible, itwas mainly European Union banks which
were deliberately attracted, and these nowaccount for nine of the ten largest investorsin this sector.
In connection with the privatisation process
the efficiency of the banking sector has in-creased considerably in the past few years.For example, in 2002 only a few accedingcountries had spreads between lending anddeposit rates that were perceptibly greaterthan those in the euro area. Consequently,the banks provided market participants withfinancial intermediation services on favour-able terms and conditions. In the past, how-ever, banks’ income from these transactionswas sometimes not sufficient to cover thecosts. Nonetheless, in the past few years theprofitability of banks has improved consider-ably, and the average pre-tax profits in rela-tion to total bank assets in 2001 were positivein all acceding countries except Lithuania.
As already suggested, the development of
the capital markets still lags behind that ofthe banking sector. Part of the reason is thatthe capital markets can be built up only grad-ually, ie in line with changes in corporatestructures, complete market-economy orien-tation as well as a suitable legal and institu-tional environment. The development processhas also been impeded by the fact that sev-eral countries suffered financial crises and, inpart, an associated decline in economic out-put in the second half of the 1990s. Further-more, during the initial years of the transitionprocess, foreign direct investment largely sub-stituted for the capital markets in providingcorporate financing; this may also have

43delayed capital market development for a
time.
As a result, in 2002 the aggregate stock-
market capitalisation of the eight accedingcountries under review amounted to no morethan 365 billion, which is 2% of the corres-
ponding figure in the euro area. Only Poland,which has by far the largest stock market inthe region and represents nearly 50% of thestock-market capitalisation of this group ofcountries, plays any role at all in internationalterms. The subordinated importance of stockmarkets is also evidenced by the concentra-tion on a few listed companies and a lowlevel of liquidity. The annual trading volumein Poland was around 60% of listed stock-market capital; the corresponding figure forthe euro area was 150%.
Even so, there is also a distinct degree of
heterogeneity within the group of accedingcountries. In 2002 stock-market capitalisationexpressed as a percentage of GDP rangedfrom 8% in Latvia to 34% in Estonia. How-ever, considerable differences in the signifi-cance of national stock markets also existwithin the European Union itself, and thefinancial market structures of the accedingcountries are not dissimilar to those of someof the smaller EU member states.
Varying privatisation strategies are part of the
reason for the disparities observed betweenthe stock markets of the individual econ-omies. In Hungary and Poland the sale ofcompanies proceeded hand in hand with thedevelopment of institutional arrangements,and this promoted a moderate, but steadydevelopment process. By contrast, in the
Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic massprivatisation was carried out at an early stageby distributing corporate vouchers to thepublic. Although this did contribute to therapid expansion of the stock markets, thelack of a sufficient institutional framework to-gether with the wide distribution of share-holders hindered an increase in liquidity aswell as a better development of corporategovernance and control. The loss of confi-dence that ensued was partly to blame forthe Czech financial crisis in 1997, in the wakeof which the number of listed companies felldrastically.

secondary markets for government bonds.Since government bonds therefore cannotfully serve as a benchmark, liquidity on thecorporate bond market is even more restrict-ed. In some countries, the offering is limitedto short-term bonds. In view of the impend-ing EU accession, however, the number andvolume of foreign currency bonds is increas-ingly rising.
As all of the acceding countries have decided
as a matter of principle to base their old-agepension systems on a combination of thepay-as-you-go system and the funded sys-tem, pension funds and life insurance policiesare becoming increasingly important in thedevelopment of the capital markets. How-ever, this market segment has hitherto playeda notable role only in Poland, which holds aleading position among the acceding coun-tries in the area of funded pension systems.
Stability of the financial sectors
In addition to size and structure, the stability
of the central and east European financialsectors is an essential element in the Euro-pean integration process. During the 1990s,most of the acceding countries experiencedmore or less full-blown financial crises, which,as a rule, were due to a large share of non-performing loans together with an inad-equate or non-existent institutional frame-work. However, outstanding loans from theSocialist era were not always the main prob-lem. An even greater problem was the waycommercial banks granted new loans. Owingto economic dependencies, non-performing
loans sometimes went unnoticed as theywere covered up by generous follow-up fi-nancing.
Given past experience and the European
Union’s strict regulations, the statutory regu-lations governing risk provisioning have beentightened in the past few years and adaptedto international standards. The Basle capitalrules are now fulfilled. To comply with so-called capital adequacy, a risk-weightedequity capital ratio of at least 8% must bemaintained. In 2001 this figure was between11.9% in Slovenia and 19.6% in the SlovakRepublic. The problem of non-performingloans was also addressed. However, signifi-cant differences still exist between the indi-vidual countries. At the end of 2001 theirshare of total loans ranged from 1.5% inEstonia to 24.3% in the Slovak Republic andis still rising sharply.
The quality of loan portfolios should continue
to be at the centre of attention in future.Given the expected expansion of the financialsector and the introduction of new market in-struments, more care will have to be taken toensure that the desired structural conver-gence with that of the euro area does notcome at the cost of increased systemic risk.
The rapid privatisation of the formerly state-
owned credit institutions provided a substan-tial impetus towards stabilising the financialsector. It was precisely the large share of for-eign investors mentioned above that made asignificant contribution to consolidating thebanking landscape in central and eastern Eur-

help to spread banking expertise; they alsofoster technical efficiency in the banking in-dustry and raise the level of competitivenesson the national financial markets.
All of the acceding countries have made
enormous efforts to improve the effective-ness of their financial supervision. Centralbanks are typically integrated into financialsupervision. Latvia was the only country totransfer this task entirely to a newly foundedsupervisory authority, doing so in July 2001.Further progress in stabilising the financialsector at the institutional level is expected toresult from greater international cooperation.Last year, for example, a group of experts wassent by the European Commission to examinethe effectiveness of financial supervision inthe acceding countries. Furthermore, all ofthe acceding countries have undergone anevaluation by the IMF within the frameworkof the Financial Sector Assessment Program(FSAP). Looking ahead, it is essential that thedeficiencies indicated in the reports are rem-edied on a sustainable basis and the recom-mendations therein quickly implemented.
Financial market integration and causes
of international segmentation
The international integration of the financial
markets is also a significant factor. Integratedfinancial markets foster an efficient allocationof financial resources and thus increase theeconomic performance and the competitive-ness of the entire economy. Consequently,they pave the way for sustainable, non-
inflationary growth.
The integration of the central and east Euro-
pean financial markets into the euro area willbe especially important with respect to subse-quent accession to European monetary unionand to the common monetary policy withinthe Eurosystem. In segmented national finan-cial markets the danger of asymmetrical mon-etary policy impulses increases. The efficacyof monetary policy within a monetary unionconsequently hinges on the integration of thefinancial markets.

46Interest parity theory
The interest parity theory applies the law of one
price to fixed-interest, homogeneous financialpaper. A distinction is made between coveredand uncovered interest parity, which are basedon different assumptions and capture differentsegments of the financial markets.
Covered interest parity says that the return on
domestic financial paper corresponds to the re-turn on foreign paper with a hedged exchangerate risk. The interest rate differentials betweentwo economies are therefore offset by the swaprate of the bilateral exchange rate.

where i = domestic interest rate; i* = foreign
interest rate; E = spot rate; ET= forward rate;
t, k = time indices.
Equation (1) presupposes the possibility of com-
plete arbitrage between domestic and foreignpaper, ie there are no barriers in the form oftransaction costs or default risk. For shorter ma-turities (of one year or less) the degree to whichcovered interest parity is valid represents a meas-ure of the integration of national money mar-kets while eliminating exchange rate risk.
In the case of uncovered interest parity, by con-
trast, there is no hedging against exchange raterisk. As a result, it is the expected exchange ratemovements and not the swap rates that arecompared with the national interest rate differ-entials.

In addition to the implications of covered inter-
est parity, the validity of uncovered interest par-ity presupposes that no premia are paid in theforeign exchange markets for exchange raterisk. This is the precondition if financial securitiesdenominated in different currencies are also tobe regarded as perfect substitutes. Speculativeefficiency requires perfectly integrated foreignexchange markets.
When checking speculative efficiency, however,
one encounters the problem that exchange rateexpectations cannot be observed directly. Thehypothesis of rational exchange rate expect-ations offers one solution, implying that, onaverage, the actual subsequent exchange rateequals the previously expected exchange rate.

This approach involves a combined hypothesis
test which links the hypothesis of rational ex-change rate expectations (ie the rate reached isan unbiased estimator of the expected spotrate) with the hypothesis of efficient foreign ex-change markets (“unbiased hypothesis”, ie theforward rate is an unbiased estimator of the ex-pected spot rate) and the absence of exchangerate premia. Rejection of the null hypothesis,namely that the disturbance terms r
tand v thave
an expected value of zero, must therefore be in-terpreted with caution. It may be due to both in-accurate modelling of the exchange rate expect-ations and to the existence of transaction costsor of a risk premium.

47term the interest rate channel will acquire in-
creasing importance.2Therefore, with respect
to the Eurosystem, the money markets andforeign exchange markets in central and east-ern Europe are the focus of interest. Their in-tegration into the euro area will be examinedmore closely below.
Financial market integration is defined in a
number of ways in the literature. Whereas aninterpretation in the broader sense considersonly the institutional conditions necessary forintegration, a definition in the narrower sensealso considers the willingness of investors toenter into cross-border transactions. Based onthis more precise definition, there are twocategories of measurement concepts.
3
The first quantity-oriented category focuseson the volume of cross-border financial trans-actions. With methods of this category, forexample, international integration of themarkets is reflected in a relatively slight homebias. Methodological flaws are the main rea-son for not using quantity-oriented measure-ment concepts. On the one hand, a smallervolume of international financial transactionsdoes not automatically imply market segmen-tation. It is possible that there are simply noincentives to make cross-border transactionsbecause, from the investor’s point of view,there is no difference between domestic in-vestment and foreign investment. On theother hand, capital flight in connection withmonetary and financial crises can hardly beseen as a sign of a high level of integration.
If one were less concerned about the actual
volume of transactions but, instead, primarilyinterested in the structure and extent of com-
petition in the market and the attendant effi-ciency, one would use the second categorybased on the “the law of one price”. Thelower the price discrepancies for comparable(financial) products, the more integrated therespective markets. In the money and foreignexchange markets, this price-oriented meas-urement concept is incorporated into theinterest parity theory (see the explanatorynotes on page 46).
The existing level of integration alone, how-
ever, provides only a limited indication of pos-sible difficulties that could arise in carryingout a common monetary policy in an en-larged monetary union. While every deviationfrom interest parity, both covered and un-covered, is an expression of segmentationwhich hampers cross-border transactions, theunderlying causes can vary greatly and,accordingly, must be assessed differently.
Partial segmentation, for example, may reflect
the preferences of market players. Despiteimperfect integration of the financial marketsin the sense of the validity of the “law of oneprice”, there would still be an efficient alloca-tion of capital. Under these assumed condi-tions, a deviation from interest parity canoccur if market participants demand a riskpremium for investing in one of the alterna-tive forms of investment. In the case ofcovered interest parity this would mean that

kets in Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Hungary with those of the euro area were examined for the period from January 1999 to June 2002.
1 The tests 
for the validity of covered interest parity and speculative 
efﬁ ciency are based on a regression model of the follow-
ing type.
(1)  1+it
1+i*
t= "+$EtET
t,t+3+ ut
and
(2)  + vt ,ET
t,t+3
Et= "+$EtEt+3
where i and i* are the three-month money market rates 
in the various central and east European countries and 
in the euro area respectively; ET
t,t+3 is the three-month 
forward rate of the national currency and Et is the spot 
exchange rate; ut and vt are disturbance terms.
A necessary condition for money market and/or foreign 
exchange market integration as deﬁ  ned here is a long-
run equilibrium between the interest rate ratio and the 
swap rate, and the swap rate and exchange rate move-
ment. This requires the time series on the left and right 
sides of equation (1) and (2) to be either both stationary 
or both non-stationary and cointegrated. Furthermore, 
to meet the required conditions for perfect integration " 
has to equal 0 and $ equal 1 and the residuals have to be 
serially uncorrelated (“white noise”). If the residuals do 
not have the characteristics of “white noise”, inefﬁ  cien-
cies are not corrected immediately and the forward rate does not contain all the relevant information. With respect to the integration of the money markets, 
unit root tests were performed on the basis of the Aug-mented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), the Phillips-Perron-Test 
(PPT) and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test 
(KPSS). They showed that the time series (1+i
t) / (1+i*
t) is 
not stationary and I(1) for all countries. The same is true 
of ET
t,t+3 / Et. In a ﬁ  rst step, equation (1) was estimated using 
OLS. The unit root tests of the residuals conﬁ  rm that a 
cointegration relationship between the two time series 
exists in all countries.2 In a second step parameters " and 
$ were estimated robustly with a dynamic OLS (DOLS). 
In doing so, account was taken of both the endogeneity 
problem and a possible heteroscedasticity and autocorrel-ation in the data. The overview in the table clearly shows that the null hypothesis of covered interest parity being 
fulﬁ lled is rejected for all four countries. This not only 
conﬁ rms the results of the Wald test for the simultaneous 
existence of "=0 and $=1; the t-values of the individual 
coefﬁ  cients are also highly signiﬁ  cant.

49The situation is different with respect to the integration 
of the foreign exchange markets. The non-stationary 
time series ET
t,t+3 / Et now contrasts with Et+3 / Et, which in all 
countries shows a stationarity pattern. Since a long-run 
equilibrium relationship between variables with a differ-ent level of integration is ruled out, the results of the sta-tionarity test mean that the necessary condition for fully integrated foreign exchange markets must be rejected for all four acceding countries.  A study of deviations from covered and uncovered inter-
est parity during the observation period clearly shows that 
the segmentation of the money and foreign exchange 
markets varied greatly, both between the individual 
acceding countries and over time. In the past few years, 
considerable progress has been made on the money mar-
kets in particular. The deviations from uncovered interest parity, by contrast, have shown no apparent trend and have undergone fairly large ﬂ  uctuations, at least some of 
which are probably due to expectation errors.

50one of the investments has been assigned a
higher default risk. However, exchange raterisks, which occur in unsecured financial mar-ket transactions, play a more important roleand lead to a violation of uncovered interestparity.
Transaction costs are another reason for seg-
mentation; they prevent a pareto-optimal al-location of capital and consequently are to beconsidered inefficient. These, in turn, can beclassified into institutional barriers and eco-nomic shortcomings. Institutional barriers canbe influenced – at least theoretically –through policies. Restrictions on capitalmovements head the list. If, for instance, for-eign paper, in view of the expected exchangerate development, offers a higher yield thancomparable domestic paper this, in the ab-sence of any other explanations, indicatesrestrictions on capital exports. In this case,domestic investors have only a limited oppor-tunity to invest their money in higher-yieldingforeign paper and to balance out yield differ-entials via cross-border transactions by way ofinduced interest rate and exchange rate ad-justments. Conversely, if the home countryhas a yield advantage over the foreign coun-try, one may conclude that capital imports arebeing restricted.
In practice, it is often difficult to separate
clearly the effects of restrictions on capitalmovements from the aforementioned defaultrisks. Actually these are often in danger ofbeing exposed to future (additional) restric-tions upon repatriation of capital investedabroad and/or any income earned there. Forthis reason, capital controls and default riskshave sometimes been generally classified as
“political risks”
4although, as shown, they
are actually two distinct issues.
Imperfect markets and an underdeveloped fi-
nancial sector can also be underlying causesfor a violation of the law of one price in thefinancial markets. Such economic factors aretypically reflected in greater bid-ask spreads.Depending on the current market situation,these can result in both positive and negativedeviations from interest parity.
Financial market integration in selected
acceding countries
The interest parity theory is a suitable instru-
ment for examining to what extent the cen-tral and east European financial markets arealready integrated with the euro-area mar-kets. The following empirical studies focus onthe Visegrµd Group, ie Poland, the CzechRepublic, the Slovak Republic and Hungary.

The countries were selected owing to theavailability of required data; the selection alsoreflects the liquidity of the national moneyand foreign exchange markets. The observa-tion period begins with the introduction ofthe euro in January 1999 and ends in June2002 (see explanatory notes on pages 48-49).

there was still a significant lack of integrationin the central and east European money mar-

51Causes of incomplete integration of money markets in central and eastern Europe
As was demonstrated on pages 48-49 covered inter-
est parity for Poland, the Czech Republic, the SlovakRepublic and Hungary was not fulfilled for theperiod from January 1999 to June 2002. There are anumber of possible reasons for this. The followingeconometric analysis will examine which institu-tional and economic factors are relevant in this con-text. The absolute deviations from covered interestparity are taken here as the variable to be ex-plained. This is because all fluctuations aroundinterest parity, ie positive and negative deviationsalike, are a sign of the existence of transactioncosts. The following regression equation wasused.

rate
WCRR = monthly growth rate of lending at con-
stant prices
DUMKV = capital controls dummyTIME = trendh = disturbance term
i = country indext = time index
The variables M2GDP, CRPCRG, ZLZD and WCRR are
used as a measure of the performance and effi-ciency of the financial sector. Dummies are used torepresent capital controls. Initially, they take on thevalue of 1 and after a distinct liberalisation ofshort-term capital movements assume the value ofzero; if no such move can be detected in the obser-vation period, the dummy retains the value of 1. Atrend is additionally used as a collective term forthe steady evolution of the financial sector unless itis already captured by the above-mentioned vari-ables. A negative sign is expected for g
1,g2,g4andg6
since the variables are positively correlated with the
maturity and efficiency of the financial sector.They are intended to reduce existing market imper-
fections and the associated monopoly gains and,consequently, to diminish the absolute deviationsfrom covered interest parity. By contrast, g
3andg5
are expected to have positive signs since ZLZD ex-
presses imperfect competition in the banking sectorand capital controls hamper the harmonisation ofdomestic and foreign yields.
The robustly estimated results of a Feasible General-
ized Least Squares estimate (FGLS) with fixed effectsfor explaining absolute deviations from coveredinterest parity are listed in the following table.

All parameters have the expected sign and, withthe exception of the interest rate spread ZLZD, areall significant at the level of 5%. Following the lib-eralisation and subsequent development of the fi-nancial markets in the countries examined, the fair-ly large, mostly negative deviations from coveredinterest parity witnessed at the beginning of 1999declined. The degree of integration has naturallynot yet reached the level existing between thewestern industrial countries.

52kets. The deviations from covered interest
parity in all four countries were mostly nega-tive, which implies a yield disadvantage vis-à-vis the reference values of the euro area. Inthe past few years considerable progress hasbeen made in all of the economies observed.The discrepancies had clearly been reduced,especially from the end of 2001.
Furthermore, the Czech Republic had by far
the lowest deviation from covered interestparity throughout the entire observationperiod. By contrast, in other countries, espe-cially in Poland and the Slovak Republic, nosustainable international integration of themoney markets was achieved until the begin-ning of the new millennium.
By comparison, numerous empirical studies
have shown that the networking of themoney markets in the western industrialcountries picked up significantly during the1980s and that these markets can now be as-sumed to be completely integrated. Withinthe EMS and ERM II, covered interest parityhas been considered to hold since overcom-ing the exchange rate crises in 1992-1993and the removal of the last capital controls inthe spring of 1994.

If instead of the swap rate, ie the differencebetween the forward exchange rate and thespot exchange rate, the expected interestrate development in the foreign exchangemarkets is used to compare yields, invest-ments in central and eastern Europe weregenerally more profitable than correspondingassets in the euro area. Moreover, the devi-ations from uncovered interest parity weremarkedly greater than in the case of covered
interest parity. However, this is at least partlyexplained by possible expectation errorswhich arise when using the subsequent ac-tual exchange rate instead of the expectedexchange rate, which cannot be directly ob-served, and are reflected along with the othercauses in yield differentials between domesticand foreign investments.
In western industrial countries and in the EU,
the validity of uncovered interest parity hasnot been empirically confirmed either. How-ever, relevant studies mainly show that spotand forward rates between the currencies ofthese countries are at least cointegrated andthus have a long-run equilibrium relation-ship.
7No such link can be established for the
central and east European currencies.
In view of the mainly negative deviations
from covered interest parity, the default riskof short-term financial investments in centraland eastern Europe, at least since 1999, nolonger seems to have had any decisive influ-ence on the formation of prices. Instead,transaction costs and market imperfectionswhich are attributable either to the impact of

53Exchange rate premia on assets denominated in central and east European currencies
Using the general asset pricing model developed by Lucas
(1982), an attempt will be made to divide the exchangerate premia paid from January 1999 to June 2002 on assetsin Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic andHungary into a constant term and a time-dependent com-ponent. According to this model, exchange rate premiacan be explained by the volatilities in the growth rates ofconsumption, monetary stock and asset prices.
1On the as-
sumption of rational expectations, the actual subsequentspot rate is a suitable proxy for the expected exchangerate, and the regression equation of the exchange ratepremium, defined as the difference between the loga-rithms of the forward exchange rate and the expected spotrate, is as follows.

t;t3= logarithm of the forward exchange rate
et3= logarithm of the spot exchange rate in t+3
hm = conditional variance of monetary growth
hy = conditional variance of the growth in industrial
output as a proxy for consumption, which is notcaptured monthly
hk = conditional variance of the relative changes in the
share price index
e = disturbance term
t = time indexi = index for acceding countriesE = index for euro area.
The endogenous variable is defined in such a way that
positive deviations indicate a yield advantage and there-fore a possible exchange rate premium to the detriment ofinvestment in central and eastern Europe. According to the
asset pricing model, a high degree of volatility in the rateof monetary growth and in the rise in consumption andshare prices abroad increases the expected yield of a for-eign investment. This effect is the result of the convexity ofthe yield as a function of the above-mentioned growthrates and, at first glance, leads to a surprising result: withrisk-neutral investors, a high degree of volatility in foreignmarkets lowers the exchange rate premia on foreign finan-cial investments.
3Market participants’ aversion to risk can
(partly) offset this effect. In the regression the expectedsigns of the parameters of the acceding countries’ variables(b
1,b3,b5) are therefore negative and those of the param-
eters of the euro-area variables ( b2,b4,b6) positive.
The conditional variances were established by means of a
GARCH equation system. Then the parameters for identify-ing the exchange rate premium were estimated using anOLS regression model and taking account of autocorrela-tion.
4The results of the regression are summarised in the
following table.
The variables derived from the asset price model are mostly
significant at the 1% level and have the expected sign. Thevolatility of monetary growth and the development ofstock markets clearly have an effect on the level of the ex-change rate premia. By contrast, the influence of the vari-ability of growth in industrial output is ambivalent andoften not significant. Possible explanations include marketparticipants’ strong aversion to risk or poor suitability ofthis variable as a proxy for the level of consumer demand,which is actually requested but available only on a quarter-ly basis. In addition to a time-variable component, a con-stant component of exchange rate premia can also beproved in all countries.

growth rates increases the expected purchasing power ofthe foreign currency. This leads to an increase in the for-ward rate, which is a function of the expected purchasingpower both at home and abroad. — 4The estimate is con-sistent but displays standard errors of the estimated
parameters that are too low as the explanatory variables(the conditional variances) used are not exogenous, ratherhave been estimated; see A Pagan, Econometric Issues inthe Analysis of Regressions with General Regressors,International Economic Review, Vol 25, 1, pp 221-247.

54restrictions on capital exports or to inefficien-
cies related to the underdevelopment of thefinancial sector are to blame for the insuffi-cient fulfilment of covered interest parity. Theobserved yield advantages based on un-covered interest parity also indicate that thecurrency markets demanded an exchangerate premium for purchases of financial paperdenominated in the currency of a central oreast European accession country which morethan offset the amount of transaction costsincurred.
This interpretation of the price discrepancies
observed on the international financial mar-kets can also be tested econometrically. Apanel study on covered interest parity showedthat in the past both capital export restric-tions and inefficiencies of the financial sectorsin the acceding countries hampered the totalintegration of the central and east Europeanfinancial markets under observation (see theexplanatory notes on page 51). However,capital controls have now been almost totallydismantled within the framework of EU ac-cession negotiations and are not likely to playany role in future. By contrast, it can be ex-pected that the integration barriers arisingfrom an underdeveloped financial sector areof a more permanent nature and cannot besimply removed by EU membership alone.
Above all, a high level of liquidity in the mar-
kets, a market-economy-oriented bankingsector and further efficiency improvementscoupled with a satisfactory degree of compe-tition in the domestic financial markets canmake a positive contribution to further inte-gration. Evidently, the momentum of the fi-nancial sector is also associated with a fall in
international segmentation.
Another study on the significance of ex-
change rate premia in the foreign exchangemarkets looked for factors which may be re-sponsible for the varying results on coveredand uncovered interest parity and for the dis-crepancies between the swap rate and theactual exchange rate development (see theexplanatory notes on page 53).
In order to record possible changes over time
the study examined the extent to which atime-dependent component of exchange ratepremia could be established and explained bydevelopments in exogenous variables. Thestudy showed that the exchange rate pre-mium was significantly influenced by inter-nationally differing levels of volatility in mon-etary growth and stock-price developments.By contrast, the volatility of consumptiongrowth does not provide any significant oruniform explanation for the development ofexchange rate premia.
In all countries the exchange rate premia also
have a constant element. This component,which is not explained by the model, preventsa complete yield adjustment at home andabroad and reflects the reticence of investorsto invest in central and east European curren-cies in the period observed. The underdevel-oped financial sectors and the resulting mar-ket imperfections could also be reasons forthe constant component, which could there-fore not be considered part of the exchangerate premium but rather an expression of in-efficient foreign exchange markets.

55Conclusion
Now that the system of banking and financial
market supervision has been strengthenedand the liberalisation of the financial systemis nearly complete, the central and east Euro-pean acceding countries have already fulfilledimportant preconditions for upcoming EUmembership. Nonetheless, all of the marketsegments, including the especially importantbanking sector, are still considerably under-developed. Consequently, this area of theseeconomies has enormous future growth po-tential that needs to be tapped. With regard
to the acceding countries’ future participationin ERM II and desired membership of the euroarea – no “opting-out” clause has been en-visaged for these countries – it is important toimprove the performance of the financial sec-tor still further and to step up the integrationof the central and east European financialmarkets with the euro area. In doing so, dir-ect efficiency gains can be achieved in the re-spective economies. At the same time, thiswill help to prepare for monetary union.

57Reports from the
Economic Research
CentreOn the Stability of Different Financial
Systems
Discussion paper 10/03
By Falko Fecht
In many financial crises banking crises were
accompanied by distortions in the nationalfinancial markets. The simultaneous occur-rence of these two crisis phenomena fre-quently created a self-enforcing mechanism.Banks with a liquidity shortage were forcedto sell assets. These “fire sales” in turn causeda deterioration of financial asset prices whichdestabilised other banks.
The impact that sales of securities by individ-
ual banks have on financial market prices andthe banks’ ability to offset price collapses onthe financial markets thus appear to be thekey determinants of a financial system’svulnerability to crisis. This suggests thatmarket-oriented financial systems – withhighly liquid financial markets – and bank-dominated financial systems – in which Ger-man-type universal banks predominate – facedifferent risks from such crises.
To analyse this question within a theoretical
framework, this research paper first explainsthe emergence of different financial systemsas a function of the number of householdswith efficient direct investment opportunities.In an economy in which households face aliquidity risk but where long-term investmentsgenerate a higher return, a financial systemevolves displaying the salient features of amarket-oriented system if the percentage ofhouseholds with direct investment opportun-

58ities which are as efficient as those available
to banks is comparatively high. In this finan-cial system the function of banks is confinedto providing efficient investment alternativesto households with inferior opportunities fordirect investment. Households participate toa large extent in the primary as well as in thesecondary financial market, whereas the in-volvement of banks is fairly minor. Thedeposit contracts offered by banks in such afinancial system do not provide any liquidityinsurance to households – the yield structureof the deposit contracts is just as steep asthat of direct investment opportunities. In theother case, in which a relatively high percent-age of households has inefficient direct in-vestment opportunities, a bank-dominatedfinancial system arises in which bank depositsdo represent a liquidity insurance. In thisfinancial system banks are active in both theprimary and secondary financial markets,while households only participate in the sec-ondary financial markets and their transac-tions have only a comparatively small volume.
In the framework of our model a run on a
single bank causes contagion of other banksvia price distortions in the financial marketneither in market-oriented nor in extremelybank-dominated financial systems. In market-oriented financial systems price distortionsstemming from fire sales by individual banksare low owing to the deep market liquidity.Moreover, owing to their smaller trading vol-ume in the financial markets banks are barelyaffected by price fluctuations in these mar-kets. In bank-dominated financial systems, bycontrast, banks have a buffer through whichthey can offset price collapses in the second-ary markets. In extremely bank-dominated
financial systems this buffer is sufficient in re-lation to the banks’ trading volume in thefinancial market, so that price distortionscaused by fire sales of a distressed bank donot lead to the collapse of other banks. It is inonly moderately bank-dominated (or hybrid)financial systems, in which the percentage ofhouseholds with efficient direct investmentopportunities is comparatively high but doesnot lead to the emergence of a market-oriented system, that the collapse of bankdue to a sudden drop in asset prices in thefinancial markets precipitates other banksinto crisis.
The model indicates that deeper liquidity of
national financial markets does not neces-sarily imply greater stability of the financialsystem. Rather, a transition from a bank-dominated financial system towards a mar-ket-oriented financial system giving house-holds improved access to direct investmentsand greater participation in the financial mar-kets may lead to a transitory increase inthe fragility of the financial system. Structuralchanges of this nature therefore require spe-cial vigilance on the part of prudential super-visors particularly in a phase of transitionfrom a bank-dominated to a market-orientedfinancial system.

59Money in a New-Keynesian model
estimated with German data
Discussion paper 15/03
By Jana Kremer, Giovanni Lombardo andThomas Werner
This discussion paper analyses the importance
of the monetary aggregate M3 for the cyclicaldevelopment of the west German economybetween 1970 and 1989 using an estimatedNew-Keynesian model. Comparable studiesfor the United States
1and the euro area2indi-
cate that money is a less important factor forexplaining economic development. Accordingto those studies, the relationship betweenreal and nominal variables can be describedexclusively via the short-term nominal interestrate. By contrast, the results of this discussionpaper indicate that in western Germanymoney has played an autonomous role in themonetary transmission process.
In the discussion paper a simple New-
Keynesian model is estimated using a max-imum likelihood method in which monetarypolicy is described as following a Taylor rule.A key finding is that a complementary rela-tionship exists between consumption andmoney balances in households’ utility func-tion. Consequently, the model dynamics areinfluenced, independently of nominal interestrates, also by monetary growth.
3This sug-
gests inter alia that the money stock should
be incorporated into the Bundesbank’sresponse function, which also emerges in es-timating the monetary policy rule within themodel. The estimation indicates that an accel-eration of monetary growth led to highercentral bank interest rates. In addition, fluctu-
ations in the inflation rate implied relativelystrong interest rate responses. The outputgap was regarded as less important. A furtherfinding is that monetary policy was character-ised by relatively high persistence in respectof the interest rate moves.
The estimated model examines four exogen-
ous shocks: a technology shock, a money de-mand shock, a preference shock that affectsthe intertemporal elasticity of substitution inconsumption, and a monetary policy shockwhich captures deviations of monetary policyfrom the estimated monetary policy rule. Theimpulse-response functions outlined in thediscussion paper show the response of theendogenous variables – output, inflation,short-term nominal interest rates and moneystock – to these shocks. The results particular-ly underscore the significance of the comple-mentarity between consumption and moneybalances. This complementarity implies that,following a positive money demand shock,households increase their money balances fora time to the detriment of consumption. Thiscan explain a short-run negative correlationbetween output and the money stock, suchas that which prevailed in western Germanyin the second half of the period under review.Moreover, money balances enter firms’ la-bour cost via the labour supply, ie the position

3This result is robust to various modifications of the
model assumptions (variations of the Taylor rule and re-
laxation of the assumption of rational expectations con-
cerning price-setting by firms) and of the data set (use of
the GDP deflator instead of the consumer price index).

60of the Phillips curve also depends on the
money stock. Hence monetary policy influ-ences inflation dynamics both via nominalinterest rates and via the money stock.
Finally, the significance of the exogenous
shocks for explaining the variance of the en-dogenous variables is determined using avariance decomposition. It should be borne inmind, however, that the estimation resultsare usually compatible with different inter-pretations of the fundamental shocks; thetechnology shock can be understood, for ex-ample, in the extended sense as a supply
shock. Given this constraint, it emerges thatmost of the variance in output can be attrib-uted to money demand and technologyshocks. Preference and policy shocks, by con-trast, are of lesser importance.
The robustness of the results presented in this
discussion paper to an extension of the theor-etical model is to be examined in future re-search projects. A key aim in connection withthe question under consideration is a morecareful modelling of the financial markets.

*These euro area retail bank interest rates should be used with caution and Member States. Furthermore, the national interest rates are not harmonised
for statistical purposes only, primarily to analyse their development over in terms of their coverage (new business and/or outstanding amounts), th e
time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. The
national interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. —1En-
