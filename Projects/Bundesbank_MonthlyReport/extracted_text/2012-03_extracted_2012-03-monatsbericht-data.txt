Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The sideways movement in the German econ -
omy since the fourth quarter of last year is 
likely to have continued for a time after the 
turn of the year. Although the indicators show 
that overall economic activity in January re -
covered from the weak results in December, 
economic output in February is likely to have 
been impaired in view of the very cold winter 
weather in the first half of the month. The in -
flow of new orders, which began to falter 
around the middle of last year, is not signalling 
any fundamental improvement yet either. The 
confidence indicators, however, are pointing to 
a pick-up in economic activity for the second 
quarter. For instance, enterprises’ expectations 
are clearly pointing upwards again and even 
their assessment of the current situation has 
barely suffered so far from the dip in economic 
activity. Rather, enterprises are still hiring new 
staff on a considerable scale. Furthermore, the 
ongoing steady improvement in the labour 
market situation and the prospect of sharp 
wage increases are fostering households’ will -
ingness to purchase and invest. The construc -
tion sector is benefiting from this in particular.
Industry
Industrial output recovered appreciably in Janu -
ary (+1.4%) compared with December (-2.0%). 
It thus virtually matched the average of the 
final quarter of 2011. Manufacturers of inter -
mediate goods cut back their output by 1½%. 
The manufacture of basic metals declined 
sharply, while there was a slight pick-up in out -
put in the chemical and pharmaceutical indus -
try. Manufacturers of capital goods recorded a 
marked increase (1½%) in output. Whereas 
output in the mechanical engineering sector 
largely held up at the average level of the fourth quarter and car manufacturers recorded 
only moderate growth in output, manufactur -
ers of information and communications tech -
nology (ICT) products expanded their output 
sharply. Although the output of consumer goods 
matched its December level, it was still down 
¾% on the average of the previous quarter.
The volume of new orders received by German 
industry at the beginning of the year continued 
the up and down movements of the previous 
few months. These strong monthly fluctuations 
mainly reflect the irregular inflow of large 
orders, chiefly in the manufacture of other 
transport equipment. On the whole, orders in 
January were down 2¾% on the month, and 
3¼% on the average of the previous quarter. 
The decline in capital goods was particularly 
marked, falling by 6% including (3¼% not in -
cluding) the manufacture of other transport 
equipment. Manufacturers of consumer goods 
also suffered losses (-2½%), whereas inter -
mediate goods producers saw a ½% rise in 
orders. Domestic orders fell by ¾% overall. 
There was, however, a sharp 5½% drop in ex -
port orders. Excluding the manufacture of 
other transport equipment, the decline was still 
as high as 3¼%, with euro-area and non-euro-
area countries being affected in roughly equal 
measure.
Turnover in the industrial sector in both domes -
tic and export business picked up noticeably in 
January compared with December and nearly 
matched the level of the previous quarter. 
While slight increases in sales were achieved in 
the case of intermediate and capital goods, 
manufacturers of consumer goods suffered 
substantial losses. The seasonally adjusted 
value of exported goods also showed a percep -
tible increase on the month in January follow -
ing a sharp decline and was marginally up on 
the level of the fourth quarter. Imports, too, 
picked up noticeably.Economic dip

Construction
Construction output was stepped up consider -
ably in January by a seasonally adjusted 4¼% 
on the depressed level of the previous month, 
which had been due to special factors. The 
quarter-on-quarter figure showed a ¾% in -
crease. The comparable figure for building con -
struction was +1½%. Civil engineering under -
went a slight decline, however. Construction 
orders in December – more recent data are un -
available at present – declined by 2¾%, which 
was down significantly on the strong showing 
of the previous month. In the fourth quarter as 
a whole, construction orders were, however, 
up ½% on the volume of the previous quarter.
Labour market
The upward trend in the labour market contin -
ued at the beginning of the year. The number 
of persons in work in Germany in January 
showed a very sharp seasonally adjusted 
86,000 increase on the month. This was 
611,000, or 1.5%, higher than the correspond -
ing figure for the previous year. According to 
an initial estimate in December, the seasonally 
adjusted number of persons in jobs subject to 
social security contributions was also continu -
ing to rise sharply. The increase over the course 
of 2011 amounted to 718,000, or 2.6%. By 
contrast, there was a further decline in the 
number of persons working exclusively in low-
paid part-time jobs. According to the Ifo em -
ployment barometer, enterprises’ willingness to 
recruit new staff remained at a very high level 
in February. Despite a slight decline, a similar 
picture is given by the Federal Employment 
Agency’s BA-X job index.
Despite the exceptionally cold weather condi -
tions in the first half of the month, the season -
ally adjusted number of persons registered as 
unemployed in February remained at the same 
level as in the previous month (2.87 million).

tion) was unchanged at 6.8%. Given that la -
bour market policy measures are being further 
scaled back owing to the improved employ -
ment situation, the 420,000 year-on-year fall in 
total underemployment (excluding short-time 
work) as recorded by the Federal Employment 
Agency was significantly sharper than the de -
cline in registered unemployment (203,000  
persons). While the gradual improvement in 
the number of longer-term job seekers receiv -
ing the basic welfare allowance continued, 
there was a slight rise in the number of unem -
ployed persons claiming insurance benefits.
Prices
The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil showed 
a further rise during February and, at US$118¾ 
on a monthly average, was 6½% higher than in 
January. Concerns about a possible escalation 
of the conflict in Iran was not the sole factor 
behind this. There were also supply shortages 
in a number of countries. As this report went to 
press, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at 
US$123¼. Crude oil futures were being quoted 
at a discount of US$2¾ six months ahead and 
US$6¼ 12 months ahead.
January saw a sharp seasonally adjusted 
month-on-month rise of 4.5% in the prices of 
energy imports owing to higher crude oil prices 
and the depreciation of the euro. Excluding en -
ergy, the month-on-month rise was still consid -
erable at 0.3%. The month-on-month rate of 
price increase in domestic sales stood at 0.7% 
for energy and at 0.4% for other industrial 
goods. The year-on-year figures went down 
to 3.7% in the case of import prices and 
to 3.4% in the case of producer prices.
The sharp rise in consumer prices continued in 
February; prices went up by a seasonally ad -
justed 0.4% on the month. There was a sharp 
rise in the cost of petroleum products, in par -
ticular, owing to the rise in crude oil prices. 
There was a weather-related increase in food 
prices, while the preceding depreciation of the euro and the overall positive economic situ -
ation were exerting upward pressure on the 
prices of other industrial goods and services. 
Annual inflation went up from 2.1% to 2.3% 
according to the national CPI and from 2.3% 
to 2.5% according to the HICP .
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance institutions and 
the health insurance fund combined recorded a 
very high surplus of almost €9½ billion in 2011, 
compared with just under +€4 billion one year 
previously. The health insurance fund ac -
counted for nearly €5½ billion of the surplus 
and the health insurance institutions for the re -
maining €4 billion. Overall, the revenue of the 
institutions and the fund rose by almost 5½%, 
while their expenditure increased by just over 
2%.
The health insurance institutions’ revenue (de -
termined mainly by the transfers from the 
health insurance fund for 2011, which were 
fixed at the end of 2010) grew significantly 
faster (+5%) than their expenditure (just over 
+2%). The additional contributions charged by 
individual institutions (which amounted to just 
over €½ billion in total) continued to play only 
a minor role. Health insurance institutions’ out -
lays remained well below the expected level. 
Spending on pharmaceuticals was almost 4½% 
down on the year because manufacturers’ dis -
counts on pharmaceuticals that are not subject 
to the fixed-amount regulation were raised 
with effect from August 2010 and discount 
agreements enabled sizeable cost savings.

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

again year on year in the final quarter of 2011. 
By contrast, some of the other areas recorded 
strong growth in expenditure for the year as a 
whole. Spending on hospital treatment, a par -
ticularly large quantitative component of the 
scheme’s expenditure, rose by 3½%. There was 
even a very sharp increase in outlays on sick -
ness benefit (+ 9%) and home nursing (+ 9½%). 
The high surplus recorded by the health insur -
ance institutions is due to growth in expendi -
ture having been significantly overestimated 
when the transfers from the health insurance 
fund were fixed.
The health insurance fund’s revenue rose by 
5½% in total in 2011. This growth was largely 
due to the increase in the general contribution 
rate (from 14.9% to 15.5% on 1 January 2011), 
as well as to the favourable developments in 
wages and salaries subject to compulsory con -
tributions and in employment. Overall, contri -
bution receipts grew by close to 6½%. After 
adjustment for the contribution rate increase, 
the rise came to just over 2%. The sharp de -
cline in the number of unemployed persons 
and short-time workers (on whose behalf con -
tributions are paid) dampened growth in con -
tribution receipts. Furthermore, the last two 
adjustments to pensions, which are also sub -
ject to compulsory contributions, were rela -
tively small and, moreover, there was virtually 
no increase in the number of pensioners. By 
contrast, central government grants were 
somewhat lower than in 2010. The health in -
surance fund’s high positive balance was ulti -
mately due to a considerable underestimation 
of both macroeconomic growth and, in partic -
ular, the contribution base.
The high surpluses recorded in 2011 enabled 
both the health insurance fund and the health 
insurance institutions to top up their reserves 
substantially. However, the scheduled reduc -
tion of almost €1½ billion in transfers from the 
central government budget and the likely ab -
sence of the previous dampening effect on 
year-on-year developments in spending on 
pharmaceuticals will probably lead per se  to a Health insurance 
fund records surplus thanks to better-than-forecast wage developments

deterioration in the financial situation in 2012. 
In autumn 2011, the group of statutory health 
insurance estimators forecast a largely bal -
anced budget for both the institutions and the 
fund in 2012. Nonetheless, the health insur -
ance institutions currently appear likely to re -
cord a surplus – albeit lower than in 2011 – be -
cause the spending estimate was based on an 
overstated value for 2011. The estimate for the 
health insurance fund’s contribution receipts 
could be exceeded again in 2012 thanks to 
positive developments in earnings subject to 
compulsory insurance contributions.
The health insurance system’s large reserves are 
likely to be of a temporary nature. Even if pro -
viders largely resist the temptation to expand 
benefits often caused by large reserves, the 
tendency for expenditure to increase more 
sharply than income subject to compulsory in -
surance contributions will probably continue in 
the future. However, the reserves mean that 
the health insurance institutions can postpone 
introducing or increasing additional contribu -
tions, and the health insurance fund will use 
the reserves in future to finance the social 
equalisation mechanism2 before they resort to 
using central government funds for this pur -
pose. Cutting the general contribution rate, 
which would result in lower transfers from the 
health insurance fund to the health insurance 
institutions, would accelerate the introduction 
of additional contributions and thus intensify 
competition among the institutions at an earl -
ier point in time. By contrast, reducing the cen -
tral government grant without adjusting the 
transfers to the health insurance institutions 
would result in the fund’s reserves being used 
up more rapidly and central government funds 
thus being required sooner.
Public long-term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme re -
corded a surplus of just under €½ billion in 
2011, meaning that the result was virtually un -changed on the year. Revenue and expenditure 
grew at more or less the same pace (by just 
over 2% each). Although employees’ contribu -
tions rose significantly (+3½%) as a result of 
the favourable labour market developments, a 
decline in contributions on behalf of recipients 
of unemployment benefits and pensioners 
dampened growth in revenue (as was the case 
in the health insurance scheme). At the end of 
2011, liquid reserves stood at almost €5½ bil -
lion and therefore remained clearly above the 
statutory minimum requirement of half of a 
month’s average expenditure (currently at just 
under €1 billion).
The financial situation is likely to deteriorate in 
2012, most notably because the benefit rates Reserves make 
higher spending tempting

2 If the scheduled transfers from the health insurance fund 
do not cover the institutions’ spending, the average of the 
additional contributions charged by all the health insurance 
institutions is calculated. If this amount exceeds 2% of an 
individual’s income subject to compulsory insurance contri -
butions, he or she is to be reimbursed using the fund’s re -

were increased as planned (by just under 2% 
on average) at the beginning of the year. In fu -
ture, these rates are to be adjusted every three 
years. In the longer term, a structural deficit is 
on the cards owing to demographic changes, 
and the contribution rate will have to be raised 
to compensate for this. The Federal Govern -
ment’s planned reforms to increase nursing 
benefits, particularly for those suffering from 
dementia, would amplify this development. 
Additional revenue of just over €1 billion as a 
result of a one-off increase in the contribution 
rate from 1.95% to 2.05% (or 2.3% for the 
childless) would probably only offset additional 
expenditure initially. Moreover, an additional 
private long-term care provision subsidised 
through supplementary allowances and tax 
concessions – much like the Riester pension – is 
also under discussion. However, it is important 
to assess the cost-efficiency of this measure, 
which would entail fiscal burdens, particularly 
as it would probably induce merely a rechan -
neling of private savings.Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market in -
creased in January 2012. Bonds with a total 
value of €141.4 billion were placed on the mar -
ket in the month under review, compared with 
€91.1 billion in December 2011. After deduct -
ing redemptions – which went up – and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own bonds, however, the volume of domestic 
bonds outstanding fell by €28.5 billion on bal -
ance compared with net redemptions of €44.2 
billion in December. Net sales of foreign debt 
securities amounted to €23.0 billion. The net 
volume of funds returned to investors in the 
German bond market in January thus totalled 
€5.5 billion.
Credit institutions significantly cut back their 
capital market borrowing in January by €31.8 
billion (December 2011: -€15.5 billion), partly 
because of their relatively good liquidity situa -
tion. They notably redeemed the category of 
“other bank debt securities”, which can be 
structured flexibly, for €11.0 billion net. But 
they also ran down their outstanding volume 
of public Pfandbriefe (€9.5 billion), debt securi -
ties issued by specialised credit institutions 
(€8.8 billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe (€2.5 
billion).
In the month under review, German enterprises 
redeemed debt securities worth €6.2 billion 
net, mainly in the form of bonds and notes 
with maturities of more than one year.
By contrast, the public sector raised €9.6 billion 
net of fresh capital in the market in January. 
Central government increased its bond market 
borrowing by €5.9 billion on balance. It sold 
mainly five-year Bobls, two-year Schätze and, 
to a lesser extent, 30-year Bunds (for €4.5 bil -
lion, €4.7 billion and €2.6 billion respectively). 
On the other hand, it redeemed principally ten-
year Bunds (€10.9 billion), but also Bubills in Planned nursing

In the reporting month, debt securities were 
purchased predominantly by domestic non-
banks (€9.0 billion), which solely bought for -
eign bonds and notes on balance. The Bundes -
bank, too, added interest-bearing instruments 
worth €3.4 net billion to its portfolio, most of 
which were likewise foreign issues. By contrast, 
foreign investors and domestic credit institu -
tions cashed in debt securities for €15.9 billion 
and €1.9 billion net respectively.
Equity market
In January, €0.3 billion of new shares were is -
sued in the German equity market. For the 
most part, these were shares of unlisted com -
panies. At the same time, the volume of for -
eign equities outstanding in Germany fell by 
€1.7 billion. On the purchasing side, only Ger -
man non-banks increased their equity expo -
sure, which they expanded by €2.1 billion, ac -
quiring mainly domestic shares on balance. By 
contrast, foreign investors and domestic credit 
institutions disposed of equity holdings in the 
amount of €3.4 billion and €0.1 billion net re -
spectively.
Mutual funds
In January, domestic mutual funds recorded in -
flows of €4.1 billion, of which €3.3 billion was 
attributable to specialised funds reserved for 
institutional investors. Among funds open to 
the general public, it was primarily open-end 
real estate funds and mixed securities-based 
funds which sold share units (€0.6 billion worth 
each). By contrast, money market funds in par -
ticular repurchased shares worth €0.3 billion 
net. In addition, foreign investment companies 
sold mutual fund shares worth €1.8 billion in 
Germany. Investors were able to reinvest the 
higher dividends distributed at the turn of the 
year. On balance, only domestic non-banks were buyers of mutual fund shares in January, 
investing €7.5 billion. They focused their de -
mand on domestic acquisitions. German credit 
institutions and foreign investors, however, of -
floaded fund units worth €1.4 billion and €0.3 
billion net respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €8.0 billion in 
January 2012. The result was thus €13.3 billion 
lower than in the previous month. This was at -
tributable to the fact that invisibles, which 
comprise services, income and current trans -
fers, reverted to a deficit. By contrast, the trade 
surplus expanded slightly.
According to provisional figures from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade surplus 
rose by €0.2 billion on the month in January to 
€13.1 billion. After adjustment for seasonal and 
calendar variations, it went up by €0.3 billion 
to €14.2 billion. The value of exports and im -
ports rose at a similar rate (+2.3% and +2.4% 
respectively). Compared with the average of 
the final quarter of 2011, the changes were 
only minor (+0.2% and -0.3% respectively). 
However, price increases in export and in par -
ticular in import goods meant both declined in 
real terms.
A €2.8 billion deficit was recorded in invisibles 
in January, compared with a surplus of €10.8 
billion in December. This was due to a consid -
erable deterioration in all three sub-accounts. 
The circumstance that current transfers swung 
to a deficit of €4.3 billion after a surplus of €1.4 
billion in the previous month was the largest 
factor. This reflects the fact that the receipts 
side is usually very high in December owing to 
EU subsidy payments. The deficit in the services 
sub-account amounted to €2.4 billion, €4.3 bil -
lion less than in the previous month. The rea -
sons for this development are mainly the re -
duction of the very high income from IT and 
construction services in December, but also a Domestic non-

fairly large decline in the foreign travel account. 
The surplus in cross-border income nearly 
halved from €7.5 billion to €3.9 billion in the 
reporting period.
Cross-border financial transactions at the be -
ginning of the year were dominated by port -
folio restructuring, whereas the focus in De -
cember had lain on financial market players’ 
year-end positioning. In portfolio investment 
there were net capital exports of €41.6 billion 
in January 2012, a rise of around one-third in 
comparison with December 2011. Domestic 
portfolio investors drove the growth, increasing 
their foreign investment significantly (€22.0 bil -
lion compared with €2.0 billion in December). 
They primarily purchased foreign bonds, mainly 
denominated in euro, worth €20.0 billion. In 
addition, they added foreign money market in -
struments (€2.9 billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€1.8 billion) to their investment portfolios, 
whilst they sold equities on balance (€2.8 bil -
lion). By contrast, foreign investors again pri -
marily acted as sellers of domestic securities 
(€19.6 billion). Bonds, mainly private, showed 
the strongest decline (€15.5 billion); however, 
redemptions of maturing debt securities also 
played a significant role. In addition, foreign in -
vestors also sold German equities (€3.4 billion).
Direct investment resulted in net capital exports 
of €5.8 billion in January, following inflows of 
€1.5 billion to Germany in December 2011. On 
the one hand, foreign enterprises withdrew 
capital from Germany (€3.4 billion). This was 
conducted almost entirely via intra-group credit 
transactions, with the repayment of previously 
granted trade credits playing a fairly large role. 
On the other hand, domestic enterprises pro -
vided their foreign subsidiaries with capital 
(€2.4 billion). To this end, they reinvested earn -
ings and provided their foreign affiliates with 
additional equity capital (€5.5 billion in total). 
Conversely, domestic owners withdrew funds 
from abroad via intra-group credit transactions 
(€3.1 billion). In particular, domestic parent 
companies took out long-term loans with their 
foreign branches.Increase in net

Other statistically recorded investment com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other assets attracted net 
capital imports of €41.8 billion in January. How -
ever, non-banks recorded net outflows of 
€30.9 billion. The activities of enterprises and 
households resulted in outflows totalling €25.9 
billion; in particular, they increased their short-
term bank deposits abroad, as is usual at the 
beginning of the year. A further €5.0 billion 
were channelled abroad via general govern -
ment, which redeemed short-term foreign debt 
obligations, in particular. By contrast, the bank -
ing system raised €72.7 billion. The inflow to 
credit institutions was as much as €142.1 bil -lion. This was mainly attributable to an increase 
in credit institutions’ short-term liabilities vis-à-
vis other countries, which had fallen consider -
ably by the balance sheet day in December. By 
contrast, the Bundesbank faced outflows of 
€69.4 billion. Foreign central banks withdrew

Germany’s balance of payments in 2011
Germany’s current account surplus in 2011 fell slightly compared with 2010 to €148 billion, or 
5¾% of GDP . Although exports once again grew faster than imports in real terms, there was 
barely any change in the trade surplus owing to a pronounced deterioration in the terms of trade. 
A sharp rise in import prices, in conjunction with a continued moderate increase in export prices, 
led to a considerable outflow of income to the rest of the world. In addition, global trade did not 
grow as dynamically in 2011 as it had done in 2010. This impacted especially on German firms’ 
business with Asia. However, German exports to Asia again expanded faster than exports to the 
euro area, whereas imports from south and east Asia did not show any noticeable rise after 
recording strong growth in 2010. Over the year as a whole, the German economy’s imports from 
European countries continued to expand robustly. Germany’s current account surplus vis-à-vis the 
other euro-area countries consequently continued to contract perceptibly. It has fallen by nearly 
half from its peak in 2007.
The current account surplus was mirrored in the balance of payments by net capital exports in the 
amount of €162 billion. The large inflow of central bank money from non-residents again consid -
erably swelled the Bundesbank’s claims within the TARGET2 payment system. This reflects both 
the continued tension in the EMU financial markets and the balance of payments disequilibria 
within the euro area. Net capital exports were additionally boosted by foreign direct investment 
– which is generally dependent on longer-term, strategic planning – and financial derivatives 
transactions. By contrast, portfolio investment saw net inflows of funds – unlike in 2009 and 
2010. This mainly reflects the “flight to quality” observed in the wake of the intensifying sovereign 
debt crisis, which has particularly benefited German securities.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends
In 2011, the current account surplus was down 
somewhat on the year by €3 billion. The Ger -
man economy recorded net inflows of just 
under €148 billion, equivalent to 5¾% of GDP , 
in the year under review from cross-border 
trade in goods and services as well as from fac -
tor income and transfers. This was slightly 
below the 2010 figure (6%). Germany’s current 
account surplus thus continued its gradual con -
tractionary trend from its most recent peak im -
mediately prior to the onset of the financial 
and economic crisis.
In spite of the robust economic recovery, there 
was no substantial improvement in the trade 
balance. During 2011, exports once again grew 
more vigorously than imports in real terms. At 
the same time, however, there was a pro -
nounced deterioration in the terms of trade. 
With regard to trade in goods, this dented in -
come by almost €32 billion. The enormous 
magnitude of this price-related effect is illus -
trated by the fact that it matches the recently 
observed annual deficit from cross-border 
travel. There was also little movement in the 
balances of the sub-accounts for services, fac -
tor income and current transfers compared 
with 2010.
As in the previous two years, Germany’s cur -
rent account surplus vis-à-vis the rest of the 
euro area declined substantially in 2011. At al -
most €57 billion, it was barely more than half 
of the peak value recorded in 2007. This was 
mainly due to the fact that euro-area partner 
countries continued to benefit from the Ger -
man economy’s strong import demand. By 
contrast, domestic enterprises were at a com -
parative disadvantage in seeking to expand 
their exports to many parts of the euro area 
owing to the sluggish economic recovery in 
these countries (for details of the longer-term 
development of the German current account vis-à-vis the euro-area partner countries, see 
the box on pages 18 to 20).
Goods flows and  
balance of trade
In 2011, the German economy failed to match 
the surge in foreign trade recorded in 2010, 
when exports and imports each expanded by 
almost one-fifth. Even so, the value of Ger -
many’s goods exports rose significantly by 
11½% compared with 2010, while the concur -
rent nominal increase in imports marginally 
outpaced this figure to reach 13½%. That said, 
more than half of the increase in the latter was 
probably price-related, whereas just one-third 
of the increase in the value of exports was at -
tributable to price effects. In spite of the faster 
pace of growth in the value of imports, the 
trade surplus went up by just over €3 billion to 
€158 billion during the reporting period since, 
in terms of amount, revenue from the export of 
goods greatly exceeded overall expenditure on 
imported products. However, that still left the 
traded surplus well below the average figure 
recorded between 2006 and 2008 (+€177½ 
billion).
The growth pattern of cross-border trade in 
goods, for both exports and imports, was 
largely determined by global economic devel -
opments, which lost a great deal of momen -
tum during the second half of 2011. The vol -
ume of global trade was perceptibly throttled 
by the weaker macroeconomic dynamics re -
sulting from the sharp tightening of monetary 
policy in emerging market economies (EMEs) 
and the squeeze on the real economy caused 
by heightened uncertainty arising from the sov -
ereign debt crisis in the euro area. In the second 
half of 2011, growth in the value of goods ex -
ports slowed to 2½% in seasonally adjusted 
terms, compared with the first half of the year 
when it was more than twice that figure 
(5¾%). The slowdown in imported goods be -
tween the first and second half of the year was 
even more pronounced, falling from 8¼% Current account

to 1½%. In real terms, imports are in fact likely 
to have shrunk slightly of late.
The slowdown in global economic growth af -
fected exporters of intermediate and capital 
goods in equal measure. While both product 
ranges continued to report good results in 
2011, with sales up by around one-eighth, this 
fell well short of the exceptional surge by one-
fifth seen in each case in 2010. By contrast, the 
aggregate value of exported consumer goods 
rose by around one-tenth, which was slightly 
up on 2010. On the import side, the growth of 
intermediate goods dipped much more than 
that of capital goods. Following a very sharp 
jump of around one-third in 2010, the increase 
in the total value of imported raw materials as 
well as inputs and intermediate goods fell by 
half in 2011. But this was still higher than the 
increase posted by capital goods imports, the 
value of which rose by just over one-tenth as 
against one-sixth one year earlier. In real terms, 
the reverse is likely to have been the case, given 
the considerable increases in the prices of inter -
mediate goods. The gradual expansion of pri -
vate consumption in Germany was mirrored by 
the fact that foreign manufacturers of con -
sumer goods improved their prior-year per -
formance by raising their sales to the German 
market by one-eighth.
The regional breakdown of foreign trade starkly 
reflects the fact that the economic slowdown 
in Asia, which had hitherto been the principal 
global growth driver, was a key factor in the 
sharp deceleration of German firms’ foreign 
business during 2011. Thus goods exports to 
China, the newly industrialised Asian econ -
omies and south and east Asian emerging mar -

The pronounced rise and fall in Germany’s current account 
surplus vis-à-vis its euro-area partner countries between 1999 and 2011
The current account balance is one of the 
indicators in the EU’s macroeconomic sur-veillance procedure that was introduced 
last year in order to identify the build-up of 
imbalances within and between the Euro-
pean economies at an early stage.1 A high 
surplus or defi  cit position vis-à-vis the euro-area partner countries has major economic 
policy implications, as the exchange rate is 
no longer available as an adjustment instru-ment. It is worth mentioning in this context 
that the German economy’s current ac-
count surplus vis-à-vis the rest of the euro 
area has decreased considerably from a 
peak of almost €108 billion in 2007 to just under €57 billion in 2011.
2 Thus after grow-
ing for some years from an almost balanced 
position in 1999, the current account sur-
plus has fallen by almost half since the be-ginning of the fi  nancial and economic crisis.
During the build-up of the surplus from 1999 to 2007, Germany’s current account balance vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area increased on average by €12½ billion per year. Three-quarters of this came from growth in net income from cross-border 
merchandise trade. The only other quantita-tively signifi  cant item was the improvement 
in German investment income from euro-area countries relative to the expenditure 
on euro-area countries’ investments in Ger-many. It is notable that the average annual 
reduction in the current account surplus 
since 2008 has not only been of the same 
magnitude but has also entailed virtually no 
shift in the relative contributions of the 
trade and investment income sub-accounts.3
As regards merchandise trade, the accumu-
lation of the German current account sur-plus between 1999 and 2007 can be ex-plained by the fact that economic growth varied across the euro-area countries in terms of pace and profi  le. Given the dull momentum of Germany’s domestic eco-
nomic activity at the time, domestic enter-
prises focused on international markets. 
The rest of the euro area, like many other 
regions, often promised better sales oppor-
tunities. Conversely, the German market was rather unattractive for foreign com-panies. The annual increase in the surplus generated from cross-border merchandise 
trade would even have been around a fi  fth 
higher if import prices had not risen twice 
as fast as export prices on average.
Furthermore, the period under review coin-
cided with a drive by German companies to 
raise their profi  tability to the level de-manded by international investors. They 
achieved this inter alia  by shifting produc-
tion to other European countries through direct investment and the acquisition of 
equity stakes. Up until 2003, however, the 
German economy’s investments in the euro 
area did not yield, on average, as much profi  t as foreign investment in Germany. 
One signifi  cant factor in the build-up of the current account surplus was that the defi  cit on the investment income sub-account was 
narrowed continuously from 2004 – amid 
1 See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany’s external 
position against the background of increasing eco-
nomic policy surveillance, Monthly Report, October 
2011, pp 41-59.
2 This analysis is based uniformly on fi  gures for the 
euro area as currently defi  ned, ie the euro area (17).3 The multi-year average reveals the underlying trends in the sub-accounts and their structural impact on the evolution of the overall current account balance. How-ever, this average conceals the fact that the contribu-tion of net investment income not only fl  uctuated con-siderably from one year to the next, but also changed 
signs. To a lesser degree, this was also true of the other components of invisibles, whereas the balance 
on trade in goods was fairly steady.Deutsche Bundesbank

only small changes in Germany’s net exter-
nal asset position – and turned into a sur-
plus in 2006-7.
The fall in the surplus since 2008 not only 
extends over a very pronounced business 
cycle, but also includes the point in time at 
which the German economy became the 
growth locomotive for the entire euro area. 
The end of the last upturn in the fi  rst quar-
ter of 2008 triggered a marked correction 
in the trade balance. Up until mid-2009, the 
German economy’s trade surplus vis-à-vis 
the rest of the euro area declined by around one-third. In addition to the slump in world 
trade following the Lehman shock, which hit Germany harder than the other euro-
area countries, this owed something to the stimulus measures implemented in order to 
stabilise the level of economic activity, which also provided a knock-on boost to 
partner countries through German domes-
tic demand.4 The temporary substantial im-
provement in the terms of trade during the 
recession lessened the contraction in the 
trade surplus that would have resulted per 
se from the changes in trade volumes by 
three-tenths in 2009.
When global trade rebounded sharply from 
mid-2009 onwards, German fi  rms’ mer-
chandise trade with customers from euro-area countries likewise picked up. Part of the recession-induced fall in the trade ac-count surplus with partner countries was 
quickly recouped. Thereafter, a dampening 
effect on the trade balance resulted from 
the fact that the German economy re-
covered signifi  cantly faster than the rest of 
the euro area. The imports of intermediate 
goods from other European countries were 
boosted because many suppliers located there participated in German exporters’ strong sales performance, in particular in the rapidly expanding Asian markets. An-
other factor was that German demand for capital goods, including cars (which like-
wise have a high import content), shot up. By contrast, imported consumer goods and 
services made a rather small contribution. In total, Germany’s growth lead, which averaged an annualised 2¼ percentage points, is likely to have brought the other 
euro-area countries an estimated additional export volume of some €12 billion per year since the beginning of the recovery in mid-
2009.5 Conversely, the German economy 
4 The car scrappage premium, for example, had a per-
ceptible impact, stimulating the import of small and 
medium sized vehicles in the fi  rst half of 2009.
5 The basis of the calculations is a hypothetical alter-
native scenario in which since mid-2009 the German 
economy would grow at the same pace as the euro 
area excluding Germany. Here it is taken into consider-
ation that a fl  atter GDP path would have changed the demand for intermediate goods as well as the growth profi  le of domestic GDP use components. With regard 
to the trade effects, this is quantitatively signifi  cant due to the differences in the import content of the 
demand components. See also Deutsche Bundesbank, The transmission and regional distribution of the Ger-
man economy’s cyclical impulses within Europe,

rate recorded in 2010.1 In terms of business 
growth, China lost its leading position for the 
first time in years. Instead, sales to the Russian 
market recorded the largest increase in 2011. 
While exports to Japan and India demonstrated 
above-average expansion as in 2010, the rise in 
deliveries to the other south and east Asian in -
dustrial countries and EMEs matched the level 
of growth recorded for exports to euro-area 
partner countries. Despite weakening slightly, 
Germany’s exports both to central and east 
European EU countries, which had been gain -
ing in importance as sales markets over many 
years, and to its traditional EU trading partners 
in northern and western Europe as well as 
Switzerland, maintained their high pace of 
growth. There was also an above-average hike 
in exports to the United States. This owed 
something to resurgent economic activity in 
these countries and to the fillip provided by the 
euro’s depreciation.Imports from Germany’s European trading 
partners gained somewhat in significance. 
While imports from EU member states outside 
the euro area grew faster than the average of 
all countries during the reporting period, im -
ports from the euro-area partner countries as a 
whole were on a par with the mean rate. This 
was also true of Switzerland, whose exporters 
evidently accepted a sizeable cut in their profit 
margins in order to preserve their established 
trading links. By contrast, deliveries of goods 
from overseas countries recorded much smaller 
rates of expansion. Thus the year-on-year rise 
in imports from the United States was less than 
half the 2010 rate. The volume of goods im -German import 
demand tilted more towards Europefailed to match the strong export perform-
ance it had achieved in the last upturn in 
many parts of the euro area owing to the 
sluggish economic momentum there.
The German economy’s external assets in-
vested in the euro area have increased by 
more than a quarter since 2008, whilst its 
corresponding liabilities showed only a 
small increase. In spite of the signifi  cant 
change in investment volume, the substan-
tial decline in the yield on foreign assets 
again led to a sharp contraction of the in-
vestment income surplus.6 By contrast, the 
expenditures on liabilities to other euro-area residents remained fairly stable, with 
the exception of 2009.
Overall, the sharp fl  uctuations in Germany’s 
current account balance in relation to its 
euro-area partners can be attributed to the 
complex interaction of diverse economic processes and mechanisms; these relate not 
only to cyclical developments and foreign 
trade but also, via cross-border investment 
decisions and their associated income 
streams, to the fi  nancial sphere. Although the current account balance is infl  uenced 
by the structural economic conditions in the 
medium to long term, it is largely immune 
to any direct steering through short-run 
political macro-management.
6 The decline in the yield affected all forms of invest-
ment. For example, interest payments on loans fell by almost half in 2007 and 2011. In addition, equity cap-
ital invested abroad, which had produced excellent 
yields between 2006 and 2007, was much less profi  t-able in the past two years.
1 With respect to Germany’s trade ties to south and east 
Asia, we consider two groups of countries in addition to 
China and Japan. The first of these groups comprises the 
newly industrialised economies in Asia (Hong Kong, Singa -
pore, South Korea, Taiwan) while the other consists of the 
south and east Asian EMEs. This is very close to the IMF 
classification of countries in this region. The only difference 
is that in the IMF definition India, along with the ASEAN5 
countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and 
Vietnam) form a separate group.Deutsche Bundesbank

ported from Asia in 2011 was only moderately 
higher than in 2010. The dynamic trend in the 
influx of goods from China and the newly in -
dustrialised economies in Asia, which had far 
exceeded the natural rebound from the crisis-
induced declines, came to an abrupt halt in 
2011. Import dynamics for the south and east 
Asian EMEs also weakened, though not as dra -
matically. Japan’s exports to Germany in 2011 
likewise rose by a much narrower margin than 
in 2010, presumably in part on account of the 
considerable output losses sustained by local 
enterprises in the wake of the natural disasters 
which occurred there in March last year.
Breakdown of invisibles
The expansionary trend in cross-border services 
lost some momentum in 2011. Revenue ex -
panded by 3½% in 2011 – which was less than 
half the rate seen in 2010 – while growth in 
expenditure stood at 4¾% and was thus only 
marginally below the previous year’s figure. As 
was the case with trade in goods, this was 
largely attributable to the downturn in global 
economic activity, which had a dampening ef -
fect on the exchange of business-related ser -
vices. By contrast, the already high level of ac -
tivity in cross-border financial and insurance 
services was surpassed once again last year, 
while the travel sub-account is gradually re -
covering from the drop it incurred because of 
the financial and economic crisis. In all, services 
showed a net deficit of €6½ billion in 2011 
compared with €4¼ billion one year earlier. 
This brought to a close a ten-year period dur -
ing which there was a progressive narrowing of 
this deficit, which in 2001 had been as high as 
€50 billion.
During 2011, revenue from and expenditure on 
the international transportation of goods re -
mained at the previous year’s levels after re -
covering rapidly from the crisis-induced slump 
in 2010. This reflects the fact that industrial ac -
tivity, which sets the pace for a multitude of 
business-related services, failed to maintain the Services deficit

same degree of momentum in 2011 as it had 
provided in 2010. The net impact of cross-
border freight and forwarding activities on the 
services account was insignificant owing to 
largely equal inward and outward payment 
flows. However, this did not apply to the bal -
ance of transit revenue, which expanded by 
€2½ billion in the course of 2011, following an 
increase of €3¼ billion one year previously. 
Transit revenue is the net revenue from the 
trading activities of German enterprises whose 
goods were not transferred across the bound -
aries of German customs territory.
The sizeable increase in domestic construction 
demand prompted German building firms to 
concentrate their production capacity more on 
Germany. Over the last three years, German 
construction companies’ revenues from build -
ing, assembly, repairs and drilling activities 
abroad consequently fell to €8¾ billion after 
climbing to €10¾ billion in the period up 
to 2008. This was concurrently mirrored by the 
evolution of expenditure on related services 
provided by foreign firms, although, at €1 bil -
lion, the amount concerned was negligible, 
confirming that the presence of foreign con -
struction firms in Germany remains very small. 
Such companies evidently lack a network of 
resident suppliers and subcontractors, which are a key factor when implementing building 
projects.2
The most conspicuous aspect of the year-on-
year change in cross-border financial services 
was the leap in revenues (+10¼%) but more 
especially in expenditure (+27%). Another strik -
ing factor was the €3¾ billion surplus in inter -
national financial operations in 2011, which 
came close to matching the high level recorded 
in each of the previous three years. Since the 
onset of the financial crisis, bank commission 
income has, on balance, been responsible for 
contributing an average of €4 billion each year 
to the current account surplus, as opposed to 
just €1½ billion on average between 1999 and 
2007.

which in 2010 had been very subdued overall 
as a result of the financial and economic crisis,

2 In the services sub-account, revenues of German firms 
from construction work abroad are also matched against 
expenditure on goods and services provided by local sub -
contractors as a separate category. Between 2008 and 
2011, this declined by a similar margin from €7 billion to 
€4¾ billion, so that the net receipts of German construc -
tion firms remained largely unchanged. Conversely, ex -
penditure on services provided by foreign construction 
firms in Germany is netted with the revenues of German 
suppliers and subcontractors, but the amounts involved are 
very small.Deutsche Bundesbank

(+2¾%). However, the increase in expenditure 
on business travel, at 1¾%, was below aver -
age, after going up by over one-tenth in 2010. 
Expenditure on leisure travel went up by around 
3% in 2011. Given that 2010 saw no improve -
ment on the 5% decline recorded in 2009, this 
result should be seen as a clear sign of a swing 
in favour of travel to foreign destinations.3
Most travel destinations benefited from the 
higher sums being spent by German tourists, 
although in individual cases political events and 
sharp exchange rate movements led to marked 
swings. The level of expenditure by German 
holidaymakers vacationing in north Africa, for 
example, decreased by more than one-quarter, 
with Egypt being the hardest hit destination in 
this geographical area. In the EU Mediterra -
nean countries (excluding France but including 
Portugal), German tourists parted with 6% 
more money than in 2010. Nevertheless, 
spending was well below its pre-crisis level. 
Greece led this group of countries, posting a 
year-on-year revenue rise of more than one-
fifth. However, it should be borne in mind that 
spending by German tourists in Greece has 
dropped considerably ever since that country 
joined EMU. Expenditure on trips to south-
eastern European holiday destinations such as 
Croatia, Bulgaria and Turkey has already re -
turned to a very high level. The 9% decline in 
German residents’ travel expenditure in Switz -
erland in 2011 was probably largely due to the 
strong appreciation of the Swiss franc, which 
caused the number of foreign visitors to wane. 
Austrian travel destinations are likely to have 
benefited from this (+4¾%). Long-distance 
holidays to America and Asia likewise proved 
more popular in 2011 than one year before.
Turnover of domestic hotels and restaurants 
generated with non-residents, which, owing to 
the larger share of business travellers, is gener -
ally more elastic to cyclical effects than is the 
level of travel expenditure by Germans abroad, 
grew by 6¾% during the reporting period and 
thereby slightly surpassed the increase recorded 
in 2010. This result exceeded the previous peak observed in 2008. Overall, the deficit in foreign 
travel remained unchanged in 2011, standing 
at just under €33 billion.
Cross-border factor income flows rose sharply 
on the back of sizeable increases in both in -
ward and outward transfers of investment in -
come. In the course of 2011, income from Ger -
man residents’ external assets increased notice -
ably for the first time in three years (+8¾%). 
This growth was due to a surge in revenues 
from direct investment and cross-border lend -
ing. More information on the income from and 
valuation effects of foreign direct investment 
can be found in the box on pages 24 to 26. By 
contrast, there was no increase in the level of 
income from portfolio investment. The corres -
ponding payments by domestic agents to for -
eign investors went up by 13½% and thus even 
more sharply than incoming payment flows 
and was broadly based across all categories of 
investment. As a result of Germany’s high level 
of net external assets, the balance of invest -
ment income has recorded a surplus for many 
years now, though – at not quite €47 billion 
during the period under review – the total was 
around €1¾ billion smaller than in 2010. By 
contrast, there was little change in cross-border 
labour income, which plays a minor role com -
pared with investment income transfers.
In 2011, current transfers to the rest of the 
world stood at around €53½ billion and were 
thus slightly down on their level in 2010, when 
they had climbed by one-tenth. The value of 
corresponding transfers from the rest of the 
world to resident recipients rose by one-sixth to 
€20 billion, having remained virtually un -
changed one year earlier. This growth was pre -
dominantly attributable to higher income from 
net tax transfers, which exceeded the pre-crisis 
level. As a result, the overall deficit from current 
transfers declined in 2011 by €4¾ billion to …. but with

3 At the same time, Germany, too, has benefited from the 
trend toward holidaying “at home” that has prevailed since 
the middle of the last decade, as is attested by the accom -
modation statistics. Following a 2% rise in 2010, the num -
ber of overnight stays went up by 3¼% in 2011.Deutsche Bundesbank

Income from and valuation effects of direct investment
National statistics on external transactions 
and positions are assuming growing im-portance within the EU. The current ac-
count balance and the net external position are included as scoreboard indicators in the 
recently adopted macroeconomic surveil-lance procedures.
1 The more exacting de-
mands that this places on the analysis of the determinants and the quality of the 
statistics are illustrated below by examining the rates of return on direct investment. Dir-ect investment has been playing an increas-
ingly important role in the wake of global-
isation, and the task of measuring it is 
highly complex.
Measurement concept and 
statistical basis
To calculate the rates of return on direct in-
vestment, the return generated is compared 
with the corresponding stocks in the pre-ceding period. Following the methodo-logical breakdown of the international in-
vestment position and the balance of pay-
ments, the overall return can be split up into a cash fl  ow yield on capital invested (investment income) and a price-related 
yield (valuation effect). The price-related re-
turn contains a market price component that incorporates the effect of changes in 
equity and bond prices. In addition, an ex-
change rate effect applies to assets and li-
abilities denominated in foreign currency. The rates of return calculated in this way 
provide indicators for explaining current ac-count balances and the dynamics of net ex-ternal positions. At the same time, they en-able conclusions to be drawn regarding the consistency of external statistics.
Cash fl  ow returns on direct investment
2 are 
broken down further into earnings from equity capital and interest on direct invest-
ment loans. Whereas the income from 
equity capital is made up of distributed and 
reinvested earnings, interest income can be 
subdivided into interest on normal loans 
and interest on reverse loans. Normal direct investment loans comprise the provision of fi  nancial resources to the direct investment enterprise by the investor. In the case of re-
verse direct investment loans, lending oc-curs in the opposite direction – usually by 
the parent company borrowing from fi  nan-cial subsidiaries set up specially for this pur-
pose. The rates of return on direct invest-ment – broken down into their various 
components – are calculated separately for 
outward and inward investment (gross 
method). This facilitates comparisons of the 
respective rates of return (cash fl  ow return 
and price-related return) on German direct 
investment abroad and foreign direct in-
vestment in Germany.
Empirical results for the rates of return 
on direct investment
During the observation period from 2000 to 2010,
3 German direct investors gener-
ated an average cash fl  ow return of 5½% on their foreign shareholdings. The divi-
dend yield fl  uctuated within a narrow band and – given a relatively constant distribution

ition against the background of increasing economic

investment, including the associated returns, see OECD (2008), Benchmark Defi  nition of Foreign Direct Invest-
ment, 4th edition; and the footnote methodological

volume – corresponded to a mean distribu-
tion ratio of around 80%. Consequently, 
the reinvestment yield showed much greater fl  uctuation, with the consistently 
high dividend payouts even temporarily im-
pairing the equity positions when profi  tabil-
ity deteriorated.
Foreign direct investment in Germany has 
generated an average cash fl  ow return on 
equity of 3½% since the year 2000. At 
times, the dividend payouts actually ex-
ceeded earnings, which – amid a generally volatile pattern – resulted in a slightly nega-tive mean reinvestment yield. Particularly in 
the recession years of 2001-02 and 2008, uncovered losses were incurred in the ag-gregate, which represents a means of 
equity capital disinvestment. A sectoral an-
alysis shows that particularly monetary fi  -
nancial institutions made use of this kind of dividend policy in 2008 owing to their high 
liquidity requirements and growing risk 
aversion.
The market price effect on the equity hold-
ings of foreign direct investors in German 
listed companies had a value-enhancing im-
pact since the fi  rst survey year 2006, with 
the exception of 2008. This essentially re-
fl  ects the performance of the DAX in the period concerned. By contrast, German shareholdings abroad recorded a poorer 
valuation effect on the whole. The more fa-vourable development of the DAX by inter-national comparison therefore had per se a 
dampening effect on the value of the Ger-man net external position.
The exchange rate component of the price-
related return on German direct investment equity capital was largely infl  uenced by the change in parity of the euro against the US 
dollar and the pound sterling, as German direct investment equity holdings outside the euro area are concentrated on the United States and the United Kingdom. Ac-cordingly, an overall negative exchange rate 
effect was observed during phases when 
the euro appreciated against the US dollar 
and the pound sterling (2002 to 2004, 2006 to 2008), whereas a positive ex-change rate effect was recorded during 
periods when the euro depreciated against those currencies (2005, 2010; to a lesser ex-
tent also 2001 and 2009). Exchange rate movements had some very marked valu-ation effects from year to year, ranging from -7% of German direct investment 
equity capital in 2002 to +9¼% in 2005. In 
line with the comparatively high degree of 
globalisation of German banks through 
their foreign subsidiaries in the major fi  nan-
cial centres of New York and London, this 
generally affected monetary fi  nancial insti-
tutions somewhat more than non-bank cor-porations.Income from and valuation effects of

For the interest accruing on German debt 
instrument claims on affi   liated enterprises abroad, the analysis of the annual data 
since 2000 shows an average unweighted 
rate of 2½%. The implied interest rate var-
ied at a low level between 1% and 4½%. 
Over the past ten years, German enterprises 
paid an average interest rate of 4¼% on 
foreign loans granted to them as part of the 
direct investment relationship. The interest 
rate fl  uctuated within a band of 3½% and 
5¾%. It is striking that German debtors 
continuously paid a signifi  cantly higher 
interest rate on intra-group loans than for-
eign debtors did to German intra-group 
creditors.4
The interest rate on normal loans in the dir-
ect investment relationship stood at an 
average of around 2½% in the observation 
period and indicated no signifi  cant differ-
ences between German and foreign direct 
investment. A clearer spread of interest 
rates was observed with regard to reverse direct investment loans. Since 2002, an average interest rate of less than 2% has been received by German subsidiaries for loans granted to their foreign owners. By contrast, German direct investors paid an average interest rate of 6½% on reverse 
debt instrument liabilities to their foreign in-
vestment enterprises. In recent years, this interest rate on reverse loans for German direct investors has continuously been above 5% and up to 8¼%. The main rea-son for this was the relationship between 
German group headquarters and their for-
eign fi  nancial subsidiaries, the majority of which are resident in euro-area countries 
with special taxation rules5. Between 2000 
and 2010, three-quarters of all German 
interest payments on reverse direct invest-
ment loans was paid to such special-
purpose entities. For example, the implied 
interest rate on German direct investors’ re-
verse debt instrument liabilities to their (mostly dedicated fi  nancing) subsidiaries in 
the Netherlands stood at 9¾% in 2010.
The preceding analysis highlights the het-
erogeneous development in the profi  tability 
of the different direct investment compon-
ents. In conceptual terms, valuation effects 
and the associated risk of capital losses, 
which stem from the German economy’s 
high degree of international fi  nancial inter-connectedness, play an important role. The 
infl  uence of phenomena which also refl  ect 
direct investors’ fi  nancing behaviour is par-ticularly signifi  cant. It can thus be observed that German direct investment equity hold-ings abroad generate a higher cash fl  ow re-
turn than foreign direct investment in Ger-
many, while foreign direct investors prefer signifi  cantly higher distribution ratios. By contrast, lower interest rates are paid on 
German debt instrument claims in direct in-
vestment relationships than is the case for 
their equivalent liabilities. This interest rate 
spread – which is potentially relevant for in-
tensifi  ed economic and fi  scal policy coord-
ination – is particularly striking with regard 
to German direct investors’ indebtedness to their special fi  nancial subsidiaries in individ-ual countries of the euro area.
4 For this calculation, the normal and reverse stocks of 
cross-border claims (liabilities) of domestic affi   liated 
enterprises were taken together (asset-liability prin-
ciple). The interest rates discussed are the unweighted averages calculated from interest rates on normal and reverse loans.

nancial subsidiaries in individual countries of the euro 
area, see: Deutsche Bundesbank, German enterprises’ 
profi  tability and fi  nancing in 2007, Monthly Report, January 2009, pp 31-41. Regarding the concept of 
 intra-group loans as a means of minimising global tax 
payments (transfer pricing) in multinational enter-
prises, see: OECD (2007), Tax Effects on Foreign Direct Investment; and OECD (2010), Transfer Pricing Guide-lines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administra-tions.Deutsche Bundesbank

€33½ billion, having risen by roughly the same 
amount in 2010. General government ac -
counted for about three-fifths of this deficit, 
mainly on account of net transfers to the EU 
budget, which fell marginally in the year under 
review.
Financial transactions
The current account surplus was mirrored by 
net capital exports in the amount of €162 bil -
lion. This was primarily due to a large inflow of 
central bank money from abroad which swelled 
the Bundesbank’s claims (capital export) within 
the TARGET2 payment system. This reflects 
both the continued tension in the financial 
markets and the balance of payments disequi -
libria within the euro area. Direct investment 
(€10 billion) and financial derivatives transac -
tions (€28½ billion) also contributed to the 
outflows of funds. By contrast, portfolio invest -
ment saw net capital imports (€37 billion) – un -
like in 2009 and 2010.
The sovereign debt crisis in some euro-area 
countries and market players’ expectations re -
garding the economic outlook of various econ -
omies were major determinants of the financial 
flows. From mid-year onwards, in particular, 
there was growing apprehension that the dy -
namics of the global upturn might slacken con -
siderably. Hence, market participants’ attention 
turned to the budgetary situation of a number 
of highly indebted EMU countries whose eco -
nomic outlook looked especially gloomy and 
whose fiscal soundness was perceived as fra -
gile. Against this backdrop, rating agencies 
downgraded a large number of public and pri -
vate debtors. This exerted pressure on bond 
prices, even those issued by borrowers in euro-
area core countries, which pushed down stock 
market prices significantly, especially those of 
financial enterprises. This was accompanied by 
a flight to high-quality assets, which caused 
Bund yields to plunge to a record low. Not until 
the end of 2011 did the situation begin to sta -
bilise to a degree, partly thanks to the summit Financial

Current account, fi  nancial account and TARGET2
Following a post-reunifi  cation phase during 
which Germany recorded current account 
defi  cits for a while, the country has contin-
uously posted current account surpluses 
since 2002. These surpluses rose sharply until the beginning of the fi  nancial crisis, reaching a record level of €181 billion in 2007. After the crisis-related fall in 2008, they have since stabilised at around €150 
billion. At fi  rst the current account surpluses were offset by growth in net capital exports 
of mostly private sector fi  nancial market participants. Since the beginning of the 
 fi  nancial crisis, the German private sector’s 
net capital exports1 have fallen from year to 
year. One reason for this was German 
banks’ efforts to reduce their balance sheet 
totals and thus their cross-border assets. Domestic enterprises and individuals have 
likewise been investing fewer funds abroad. 
In addition, large safe-haven infl  ows in portfolio investment were recorded. Over-
all, in 2011, non-residents’ portfolio invest-
ment in Germany exceeded that of German residents abroad.
In the peripheral countries, a lack of fi  nan-
cial fl  ows from the private sector was made up, for the most part, by wholesale funding 
from national central banks. Central bank money generated in this way fl  owed out of  these countries via the TARGET2 pay-
ment system to others, including  Germany. 
As a result, the Bundesbank’s  TARGET2 
claims on the European Central Bank have 
risen considerably and, at the end of 2011, 
amounted to approximately €463 billion. 
An increase in the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 
claims is recorded as a capital export in the 
German balance of payments. During the 
crisis, this form of capital export via TAR-
GET2 has been increasingly “replacing” pri-vate sector net capital exports (see chart 
above).
However, the underlying cause of the change in fi  nancial fl  ows is not rooted in 
the payment system itself but rather in the 
enlarged provision of liquidity during the 
crisis, including against lower-quality collat-
eral. In this way, the Eurosystem has been 
facilitating an orderly reduction of internal 
and external imbalances in the countries af-fected by the crisis and has thus helped to stabilise the fi  nancial system. To the extent to which market adjustment processes have 
been dampened or delayed by crisis reso-lution measures, the countries concerned 
now urgently need to resolutely implement 
and pursue the necessary consolidation 
measures and structural reforms.

government and the consolidation measures 
announced by the Italian and Spanish govern -
ments as well as to the package of monetary 
policy measures drawn up by the central banks 
of the major currency areas.
Portfolio investment
The impact of the crisis on portfolio investment 
was evident, first, in the still relatively low turn -
over level. Thus in the course of 2011, over 
20% fewer cross-border fund flows were newly 
invested or liquidated than in the pre-crisis year 
2007. But it also showed up in a massive turn -
around in portfolio flows in the magnitude of 
€164½ billion. The upshot of this was that Ger -
many recorded net capital imports amounting 
to €37 billion in 2011. This change of direction 
remains considerable even after allowing for 
the fact that in 2010 capital exports had been 
greatly inflated by resident public resolution 
agencies, which took over securities previously 
held abroad by German financial institutions 
that had run into difficulties.4
During 2011, foreign investors showed a 
greater interest in German securities than at 
any time since 2007, acquiring domestic paper 
worth €62½ billion. However, this consisted al -
most exclusively of purchases of government 
bonds by foreign investors. In 2011, they ac -
quired bonds issued by Germany’s Federal Gov -
ernment worth €68½ billion net (compared 
with €77½ billion and €27½ billion in 2010 
and 2009 respectively). Given that the net issu -
ance volume amounted to just €34½ billion, 
the bulk of these cross-border purchases took 
the form of sales from domestic investors’ 
holdings. The strong demand from the rest of 
the world for German bonds underscores their 
safe-haven attractiveness in times of crisis, 
which was further magnified by the rating 
downgrades imposed on many foreign public 
issuers. The “surplus” demand from abroad 
was mirrored in the performance of Bund 
yields, which in the case of the ten-year bench -mark Bunds fell for a time to a record low of 
less than 1.7% in 2011.
By contrast, as in previous years, foreign invest -
ors made net disposals of domestic private 
debt securities with an initial maturity of more 
than one year (€20 billion). While it is true that 
credit institutions in Germany – as elsewhere – 
are undergoing a phase of reorientation, the 
return flows were primarily attributable to 
structural factors and should not be interpreted 
as a sign of non-residents’ mistrust of German Portfolio shifts

financial institutions. For example, during the 
period under review the outstanding volume of 
bonds issued by credit institutions in Germany 
declined – in line with the trend seen in recent 
years – by €47 billion. In particular, the amount 
of public Pfandbriefe outstanding has been 
contracting for years on account of high re -
demption rates.
Inflows of funds to Germany were additionally 
reduced by the low foreign demand for struc -
tured products as well as for certificates and 
warrants. In the case of this investment form, 
too, redemptions predominated in 2011.5 For 
one thing, complex financial products were 
broadly shunned in the difficult financial mar -
ket setting. For another, the situation on the 
sellers’ side may have been influenced by the 
fact that most banks in Germany found them -
selves in a comfortable liquidity position, not 
least as a result of growing deposits in domes -
tic business, and for this reason curbed their 
issuance of structured securities somewhat.
Conversely, domestic money market paper 
found favour with international investors (€8½ 
billion) although, as in the case of bonds, they 
differentiated sharply between public and pri -
vate issuers. Thus at times there was very heavy 
demand for money market paper issued by 
central government given the tense market en -vironment. By contrast, foreign investors off -
loaded privately issued instruments on balance.
Political and economic uncertainty also left its 
mark on the international equity markets. The 
broad CDAX index, for example, fell by 17% in 
the course of last year. Possibly put off by these 
losses, foreign investors proved unwilling to 
add German shares to their portfolios and 
withdrew funds from the German share market 
on balance over the year as a whole (€3 bil -
lion). By contrast, there was a rebound in indir -
ect investment in securities through share units 
issued by German mutual funds. With sales of 
just over €7½ billion, the German mutual fund 
industry sold more paper to foreign buyers 
than at any point since 2009.
Outbound portfolio investment, in other words 
German investment abroad, was likewise 
marked by investor cautiousness, especially in 
the markets for interest-bearing instruments. 
All in all, German investors’ demand for foreign 
securities fell sharply. It amounted to just over 
€25 billion in 2011, after reaching €174 billion 
in the previous year. However, in 2010, private 
transactions were dominated by the above-
mentioned transfers of securities to German 
resolution agencies, although public-sector 
purchases also played a significant role in 2011. 
For instance, cross-border acquisitions of euro-
denominated debt securities derived solely 
from purchases made by the Bundesbank in 
the context of the Securities Market Pro -
grammes initiated by the Eurosystem. The un -
favourable reports emanating from some euro-
area countries prompted most private agents in 
Germany to dispose of debt securities. On the 
whole, they sold bonds issued by the pro -
gramme countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal 
totalling €19½ billion. The German private sec -

5 As a rule, such complex financial market products are 
“produced” in Germany and targeted at German retail in -
vestors outside the financial sector. Therefore, they ought 
not to be relevant to the balance of payments. However, 
since intermediaries are often domiciled abroad, capital 
flows arise that are subject to reporting requirements. See

tor also parted with Spanish and Italian debt 
securities on balance.
By contrast, domestic investors purchased for -
eign currency bonds in the amount of €3 bil -
lion. For the most part, these issues were de -
nominated in US dollars (€1½ billion), Austra -
lian dollars (€1 billion) and Canadian dollars 
(€½ billion). In net terms, the funds flowed ex -
clusively to debtors domiciled outside the euro 
area.
Given tumbling prices on many stock ex -
changes, domestic investors reduced their 
cross-border equity exposures to the tune of 
just over €2 billion in 2011. In the main, they 
parted with shares originating from euro-area 
countries. A moderate countermovement was 
generated by capital flows to those equity mar -
kets where stock prices had developed more 
positively than in the euro area. For example, in 
2011 domestic investors acquired dividend-
bearing paper from the USA, where the US S&P 
500 index saw out the year almost unchanged. 
German savers maintained their holdings of 
foreign mutual fund units at an almost con -
stant level in net terms. Here, too, the high de -
gree of investor uncertainty may have been a 
contributory factor.
A net capital export was also recorded for fi -
nancial derivatives transactions in 2011 (€28½ 
billion). As in preceding years, this outcome 
was partly determined by offsetting transac -
tions relating to debt securities carrying deriva -
tive certificates. Additionally, payments arising 
from swap and futures trades accounted for 
the outflows.
Direct investment
Foreign direct investment (FDI) which, as men -
tioned above, is mainly guided by longer-term 
strategic decisions, felt the force of financial 
market tensions much less than portfolio in -
vestment. This applied particularly to global dir -
ect investment inflows in 2011, which, accord -ing to estimates by UNCTAD, amounted to 
around US$1½ trillion and were thus up on the 
year by about one-sixth.6 These inflows were 
broadly distributed across all groups of coun -
tries. As in 2010, EMEs and developing coun -
tries were the recipients of about one half of 
the direct investment, which mainly took the 
form of so-called “greenfield” investments, in 
other words the establishment of new loca -
tions on greenfield sites. By contrast, most of 
the FDI flows to the industrial countries oc -
curred as a part of mergers and acquisitions. 
According to UNCTAD’s analyses, these also re -
flected restructuring measures undertaken by 
multinationals in Europe.
The cross-border activities of German enter -
prises abroad and those of non-resident enter -
prises in Germany also expanded, though less 
sharply than in 2010.7 Overall, inbound and 
outbound foreign direct investment into and 
out of Germany resulted in a net capital export

This was largely driven last year by outbound 
FDI of German enterprises, which provided 
their foreign affiliates with a total of €39 billion 
in funds. The figure was substantially less than 
in 2010 (€82½ billion). A significant volume of 
these funds were injected either in the form of 
equity capital (€20 billion) or reinvested earn -
ings (€30 billion). Conversely, German parent 
companies withdrew funds from abroad via 
intercompany credit transactions (€11 billion). 
On balance, this was achieved solely by means 
of short-term financial loans from foreign sub -
sidiaries.8
At €24½ billion, most of German outbound 
direct investment went to EMEs and develop -
ing countries. However, German firms also in -
vested a sizeable €14½ billion in industrial 
countries. Noticeably high levels of German FDI 
were channelled last year to China (€10½ bil -
lion), the United States (€7½ billion) and Aus -
tria (€6 billion). While Austria’s result was influ -
enced by a large individual transaction in the 
automobile sector, the outcome for China was 
driven by high reinvested earnings on the part 
of German firms performing well there. The fig -
ure for the United States was likewise boosted 
by high reinvested earnings plus a sharp in -
crease in  equity interests, which owed much to 
the fact that German banks provided their US 
affiliates with capital injections. A breakdown 
by economic sector would not be very informa -
tive at present as reinvested earnings, which 
constitute the  lion’s share of German FDI out -
flows, are partly based on estimates and can -
not yet be assigned to individual sectors.
In 2011, non-resident enterprises expanded 
their investment in Germany by €29 billion. 
This was almost as much as in 2010 (€35½ bil -
lion). They primarily favoured intragroup short-
term financial loans (€14½ billion). In addition, 
they furnished their domestic affiliates with 
equity capital (€5 billion) and reinvested their 
earnings generated in Germany (€6 billion).
Most of the FDI inflows originated from Euro -
pean countries, including Switzerland (€6 bil -lion), Belgium (€5 billion) and Austria (€4 bil -
lion). Foreign investors targeted inter alia  
manufacturing enterprises, with a strong em -
phasis on the chemical industry (€6½ billion). 
However, at €15 billion, the bulk of the total 
amount was invested in holding companies in 
Germany, which many foreign investors use as 
a bridgehead. In this case it is not possible to 
draw conclusions regarding the ultimate invest -
ment objective or the particular economic sec -
tor.
Other investment
Other investment, comprising financial and 
trade credits (inasmuch as these do not consti -
tute a part of direct investment) as well as bank 
deposits and other assets, resulted in a net cap -
ital export of €157½ billion in 2011.
The cross-border transactions of non-banks 
were close to balance in the year under review. 
While government entities recorded inflows of 
funds of just over €1 billion, the activities of 
enterprises and households resulted in out -
flows totalling €1 billion.
The banking system was the key player behind 
the net capital export resulting from other in -
vestment. This was partly due to the ongoing 
cross-border deleveraging of German banks, 
which cut German banks’ unsecuritised liabil -
ities to foreign creditors by a total amount of 
€93½ billion. This focused on the redemption 
of short-term financial loans.9 On the other 
hand, German banks also sharply reduced their 
volumes of (unsecuritised) external claims (by 
€45½ billion). Again, the main emphasis was 
on scaling back short-term loans to foreign 
counterparties. Credit institutions therefore re -
corded overall outflows of €51½ billion. The 
available data do not point to a large-scale German direct 
investment abroad

flight of capital from the euro-area peripheral 
countries to Germany, which would have been 
evidenced by substantially increased deposits 
by private non-banks in these countries with 
German banks.10
The Bundesbank posted net capital exports to -
talling €106 billion. These were primarily gener -
ated by transactions executed via the TARGET2 
payment system, which saw a sharp increase in 
the claims on the European Central Bank in the 
second half of the year, primarily on account of 
the worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in 
the euro area. Across the year as a whole, the 
Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims increased by 
€137½ billion (2010: €148 billion) to stand at 
€463 billion at year-end. A countervailing de -
velopment was observed in the case of non-
residents’ deposits with the Bundesbank, which 
went up by €32 billion in 2011. This was due 
mainly to the temporary “parking” of deposits 
by central banks and international organisa -
tions located outside the euro area.
The rising TARGET2 balances reflect both the 
continued tension in the financial system and 
the balance of payments disequilibria within 
the euro area. Had it not been for the massive 
amount of liquidity provided by the Eurosys -
tem, especially in the peripheral countries of 
the euro area, some of the cross-border trans -
actions, which were mainly initiated by private 
sector counterparties, would doubtless have 
been unrealisable or could only have been ef -
fected under less favourable conditions. This 
would have triggered abrupt adjustment pro -
cesses and entailed corresponding macroeco -
nomic costs. In the long term, however, this 
situation is not sustainable. For this reason, it is 
crucial to restore the confidence that has been 
lost in banks facing liquidity problems. In add -
ition, countries that have forfeited access to the capital markets need to remedy their struc -
tural shortcomings and boost their competi -
tiveness, with the ultimate aim of improving 
their public finances and their current account 
situation and hence of being able to attract pri -
vate capital once again.11
Reserve assets
Transaction-related changes in the reserve 
assets are shown as a separate item in the bal -
ance of payments. In 2011, they rose by just 
under €3 billion. On balance, this was exclu -
sively attributable to a change in Germany’s re -
serve position vis-à-vis the International Monet -
ary Fund (IMF).
Balance sheet adjustments, which are not spe -
cified in the balance of payments in line with 
internationally agreed conventions, had a much 
greater impact. Just as in 2010, a significant up -
ward adjustment was made owing to the cus -
tomary end-of-year revaluation of the reserve 
assets at market prices (€19½ billion). At €17½ 
billion, most of this amount can be accounted 
for by valuation gains in gold. However, both 
the foreign currency reserves (€1½ billion) and 
the reserve position in the IMF (€½ billion) re -
corded gains. All in all, during 2011 Germany’s 
reserve assets rose by €22½ billion in balance 
sheet terms to reach €184½ billion as at the 
balance sheet date of 31 December 2011.Bundesbank

10 In 2011, the level of deposits with banks in Germany by 
private non-banks from other euro-area countries increased 
by €1 billion. In the cases of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal 
and Spain, they went down by a total of €1½ billion, which 
was largely the result of a reduction in Irish deposits with 
German banks (€3½ billion).

National and international financial market 
shocks and the real economy –  
an empirical view
The global financial and economic crisis of the past few years has highlighted the importance of 
financial markets for the real economy. The bursting of the real estate bubble in the United States 
caused problems in the US financial sector, which then spilled over to the US real economy as 
well as to the financial and real sectors of other countries, especially in Europe. The intensity and 
international scale of the subsequent crisis caught many observers by surprise and have widely 
been interpreted as posing a challenge to existing macroeconomic models’ ability to explain the 
national and international transmission mechanisms between financial markets and the real sec -
tor.
Prior to the crisis, financial markets were generally not included in macro models, nor was this 
regarded as necessary since, for the most part, the financial markets were not themselves deemed 
to contain any potential to cause disruptions. In the wake of the crisis, however, financial markets 
have been increasingly integrated into empirical and theoretical macroeconomic models, so that 
such extended models can now be used to answer questions such as the following. What role is 
played by the financial markets in general, and the banks in particular, in generating cyclical fluc -
tuations? Through what channels are financial market disruptions transmitted? What impact do 
national financial market developments have relative to those on international financial markets? 
Has the relationship between the financial markets and the real sector changed over time? 
Although these questions are difficult to answer, marked progress has been made over the past 
few years.
The present article illustrates these advances in research by examining the outputs of a category 
of empirical models developed and used at the Bundesbank. Specifically, it features a global vec -
tor autoregressive model (GVAR), which estimates the interaction between the macroeconomic 
variables and financial market variables of numerous advanced and emerging economies over 
the last three decades. This model measures the impact of an exogenous decline in the supply of 
credit to the non-financial private sector in Germany and in the United States to Germany and to 
other European countries. The transmission channels are also analysed closely. This model shows 
that a US credit supply shock can clearly affect GDP in other countries. The impact of a German 
credit supply shock would be of some importance for Germany itself but relatively irrelevant to 
the rest of the world.Deutsche Bundesbank

Relationship between 
 financial markets and  
the real economy:  
some empirical observations
The chart on page 37 shows the rate of change 
of real gross domestic product (GDP) and some 
financial market variables which capably model 
developments in key financial market segments 
– credit markets, equity markets and securities 
markets. The two countries examined in the 
model are Germany and the United States  – 
the world’s largest economy, and the most sig -
nificant economy for the international financial 
markets – over the period 1970 to 2011. The 
tables on page 38 contain data on comove -
ment, leads and lags of the relevant variables.
Within each respective country, the real econ -
omy and the credit and equity markets are gen -
erally highly correlated. This tends to be 
stronger in the United States than in Germany. 
In addition, this correlation seems to have in -
tensified recently. Equity price growth leads 
GDP growth in both countries, whereas credit 
growth co-moves with GDP growth in Ger -
many and lags GDP growth in the United 
States. Long-term interest rates and GDP are 
positively correlated in Germany and the United 
States throughout. This indicates that monetary 
policy was not the main determinant of long-
term interest rates in the period under observa -
tion, which would have suggested a negative 
correlation; instead, other factors that led to 
the positive comovement of growth in GDP 
and long-term interest rates prevailed.
If we examine the relevant variables for each of 
the two economies, we find that US financial 
market variables and real economic develop -
ments correlate positively with those in Ger -
many. The correlation between changes in 
equity prices and in long-term interest rates ex -
ceeds that between real activity movements, 
followed by the correlation between credit de -
velopments. Whereas comovement is greatest 
for financial market variables, US GDP leads 
that of Germany by one quarter.1 The close – national and international – correlation be -
tween financial markets and the real economy 
and the lead of some financial variables over 
GDP raise the question of whether a cause-
and-effect relationship exists between financial 
markets and the real economy. This question 
cannot be answered using a simple correlation 
analysis. A better method is the multi-country 
model used below.
Empirical studies using  
a global vector  
autoregressive model2
The multi-country model used here, a global 
vector autoregressive model (GVAR), enables us 
to model the dynamic interaction of large num -
ber of various countries’ macroeconomic and 
financial market variables. The GVAR is a 
“ reduced-form model” in which each of the 
model’s variables is explained by its own past 
and by that of the other variables in the model. 
Such a model tends to be theoretically agnos -
tic, thus requiring fewer a priori  assumptions. 
Given that there are still many open theoretical 
questions regarding the relationship between 
financial markets and the macro economy, 
such an approach seems to make particular 
sense.
The GVAR consists of low-dimensional vector 
autoregressive (VAR) models for each country, 
in which each variable is explained by its own 
past and by that of other domestic variables. 
All variables can mutually influence one an -
other. To answer the question at the centre of 
this article, it is also important, moreover, to High national 
and inter-national correl-ation in devel-opments in the real economy and financial 
marketsEmpirical multi-

1 If one assumes that economic fluctuations are transmit -
ted from the United States to Germany more frequently 
than in the other direction, this indicates that other trans -
mission channels besides financial market integration play a 
role; for instance, trade, through which fluctuations prob -
ably tend to be transmitted with a lag. This is also sug -
gested by the fact that GDP fell more sharply in Germany 
during the crisis than the financial market variables under 
review (see chart on p 37).

capture the global dimension. For statistical 
and methodological reasons, however, it is im -
possible to include every other country indi -
vidually in the country VARs, as this would lead 
to an outsized model. The international inter -
linkages between countries are therefore mod -
elled by including foreign aggregates in the 
country VARs. These foreign aggregates are 
weighted averages of the variables of all other 
countries, and the weights reflect bilateral 
trade or financial market linkages between 
countries. Since the weights vary from country 
to country, the foreign aggregates are country-
specific, as are the responses to foreign influ -
ences. This takes account of the heterogeneity across countries. The model also recognises 
potential long-run relations between national 
variables and between national and inter -
national variables produced, for instance, by 
globally identical productivity growth. (For de -
tails on the model and how it is estimated, see 
the box on pages 39 to 42.)
The analysis in this article focuses on German 
and US financial market events and their trans -
mission to Germany and Europe. However, it is 
important to include not only European and US 
variables but also those of other countries in 
order to capture various types of third-country 
effects.Selected real economic and financial variables

The model contains 29 countries: four core 
euro-area countries (Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain); the United Kingdom; three other non-
euro-area EU member states; the United States; 
Canada; five Latin American countries; nine 
Asian countries (including Japan and China); 
Australia; and New Zealand. This group of countries covers a large part of the global 
economy. It reflects, in particular, that over -
whelmingly large part of the global economy 
to which Germany and the United States are 
exposed through financial transactions and 
goods trade. As a case in point, it covers over 
70% of Germany’s foreign trade.
In order to adequately reflect the national and 
international financial influences, it is also im -
portant to include variables which capture po -
tential transmission channels. To this end, the 
following quarterly variables are included, 
where available, for each country: real GDP , 
consumer prices, short and long-term interest 
rates, volume of credit, credit spreads, real 
equity prices, and the real bilateral exchange 
rate against the US dollar. The observation 
period runs from 1984 to 2009. This means 
that, in principle, it is also possible to account 
for events since the beginning of the crisis. (The 
box on page 42 provides details on the data.)
This shows clearly that GVAR models are very 
complex, highly reflect the close relationships 
between various countries and variables and 
are, to that extent, superior to smaller models 
that include fewer variables. What sets the 
GVAR (like other reduced-form models) apart 
from other popular model frameworks, such as 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) 
models, which are likewise often used to study 
the transmission of financial market shocks, is 
that it is relatively agnostic and requires little in 
the way of theoretical background. Although 
the results are sometimes more difficult to in -
terpret, they are, at the same time, probably 
more robust since the results of more theoret -
ical models depend more heavily on assump -
tions.

Methodological notes on the global vector autoregressive 
study
Model
The global vector autoregressive (GVAR) 
model used in this analysis consists of low-
dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) 
models for each country.1 The economic dy-
namics for country i can be described using 
equation (1)
 (1),
where xi,t is a ki×1-dimensional vector of 
endogenous variables, x*
i,t is a k*
i×1-
dimensional vector of country-specifi  c for-
eign variables, dt is a vector of global vari-
ables, and ai,0 and ai,1t denote the effects of 
a constant and a linear trend. ui,t is a ki×1 
vector of serially uncorrelated innovations  
ui,t: iid(0,∑u,i). αi,j, βi,j and γi,j are coeffi   cient 
matrices and denote country-specifi  c ef-
fects of national and international infl  u-
ences on the corresponding variables.
The foreign variables in the country VARs are constructed as weighted averages of 
other countries’ variables. The gth element 
of x*
i,t can be written as
 (2),
where wi,g,j is a weight which captures the 
exposure of country i to country j coming 
from variable g.  and wi,g,j = 0 
apply for i = j.
The country VARs can be combined to form a high-dimensional GVAR
 (3),
where the parameters in equation (3) are composed of the estimated parameters in equation (1) and the observed weights in 
equation (2) and p is the maximum country-
specifi  c number of lags on endogenous and exogenous variables.
Estimation
We estimate the VARs separately for each 
country, allowing for possible cointegration 
among endogenous variables and among 
endogenous and exogenous variables.2 We 
use the Akaike Information Criterion to es-
tablish how many lags on variables to in-
clude in the model.All country VARs except that for the United 
States include, as endogenous variables (if 
available), gross domestic product (GDP), 
consumer prices, the volume of credit, real 
stock prices, the exchange rate and the 
interest rates and spreads between corpor-
ate bond yields and the government bond 
yield and, as exogenous variables, the cor-
responding values (apart from the exchange 
rate) as weighted averages of the other 
countries’ variables and the oil price. The 
endogenous variables in the US model are 
GDP , consumer prices, the volume of credit, real stock prices, interest rates and spreads 
and the oil price; the exogenous variables 
are the weighted averages of the GDP , con-sumer prices and exchange rates of all other countries. One condition for estimating the 
VAR models separately for each country is 
an absence of long-run feedback from the

domestic variables to the foreign aggre-
gates in the corresponding model equa-tions (weak exogeneity). Given that the 
United States plays a dominant role in the 
world fi  nancial markets and that foreign fi  -
nancial market variables cannot be assumed 
to be weakly exogenous for US variables, 
the US model does not contain foreign fi  -
nancial market variables.3,4
We model the variables of the (largest) indi-
vidual euro-area countries in separate 
VARs.5 This allows us to look explicitly at 
credit supply shocks in Germany and to 
examine heterogeneity within the euro area 
regarding adjustments following credit sup-
ply shocks in more detail. Although this type of modelling does not take full ac-
count of the fact that the euro area has had 
a single monetary policy since 1999, it is justifi  able because monetary policy is not 
the main focus of the analysis. We identify a credit supply shock in Germany only (and not in any other euro-area country) and dis-
tinguish it from a German monetary policy 
shock (which is hypothetical from 1999 on-
wards). As the biggest euro-area country, Germany would probably have the largest 
weight in the European Central Bank’s im-
pulse response function anyway.
Identifi  cation of credit supply shocks
We identify credit supply shocks on the 
basis of intuitive, theoretical assumptions regarding the direction in which certain variables move shortly after such shocks (sign restrictions). It is important to select restrictions which distinguish the shocks under analysis from other shocks which 
may also have played a role in the observed 
movements (eg macroeconomic or monet-
ary policy shocks).6 The table on page 41 
shows the imposed restrictions.7 We as-
sume that the volume of credit and lending 
rates move in opposite directions after credit supply shocks and in the same direc-tion after credit demand shocks in order to 
distinguish between these two types of 
shock. Furthermore, credit and GDP are as-
sumed to fall following a credit supply 
shock, as is the credit-to-GDP ratio. The re-striction imposed on the credit-to-GDP ratio 
allows a distinction to be drawn between macroeconomic (supply and demand) 
shocks. Following macroeconomic demand shocks, GDP can be expected to move more strongly than the volume of credit, at least in the short term, meaning that the credit-
to-GDP ratio will rise after a negative 
macroeconomic shock. In addition, the dif-ference between the lending rate and yields 
on government bonds with (roughly) the 
same maturity – the credit risk premium – is 
assumed to increase, as is the difference between the lending rate and the short-
term interest rate. The latter restriction dis-
tinguishes the credit supply shock from a contractionary monetary policy shock, fol-lowing which the short-term interest rate 
should move more forcefully than the lend-ing rate in the short run. We do not impose any restrictions on the other variables in the 
model. The identifi  cation approach used in 
this analysis is consistent with theoretical 
3 Eickmeier and Ng (2011) show that the assumption 
of weak exogeneity is very rarely rejected.
4 S Dées, F di Mauro, H Pesaran and V Smith (2007), Exploring the international linkages of the euro area: A 
global VAR analysis, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 
22(1), pp 1-38, Xu (2010), and Beaton and Desroches (2011) all take a similar approach.
5 This is unlike the model used by Eickmeier and Ng 
(2011), which includes the euro area as a single entity.6 Other (VAR) studies instead assume that certain vari-ables respond to shocks with a lag. However, this iden-
tifi  cation approach would be very diffi   cult to justify when examining monetary and fi  nancial variables in particular, which tend to change rapidly, and often 
daily.7 The sign restrictions are implemented such that the impulse responses are ≤ 0 and ≥ 0.Deutsche Bundesbank

general equilibrium models8 and existing 
empirical studies.9
In order to identify US and German credit 
supply shocks, we orthogonalise the re-duced form residuals of the two country 
VARs ( ui,t ) using a Cholesky decomposition 
of the covariance matrix. We then rotate the orthogonalised residuals and impose 
the sign restrictions.10
This method ensures that the credit supply 
shocks are uncorrelated with other domes-tic shocks,
11 but not that they are uncorre-
lated with other foreign shocks. The ques-
tion of whether the identifi  ed shocks can actually be interpreted as country-specifi  c 
therefore depends on the degree of correl-
ation between the countries. The fact that 
the foreign aggregates are included in equation (1) contemporaneously should help to sharply reduce the correlation be-tween the residuals of different countries. 
Calculations show that the pairwise correl-
ation between the residuals is in fact very 
low. The correlation between the two iden-tifi  ed credit supply shocks is also only -0.13 and thus virtually negligible. The shocks can 
therefore be interpreted as essentially 
 country-specifi  c.
We calculate the uncertainty associated with estimating the parameters using a bootstrap approach based on 200 draws. The charts display the medians and the 90% confi  dence bands of the impulse re-
sponse functions.8 See Gerali et al (2010); Atta-Mensah and Dib (2008);

“generalised impulse response functions” approach. 
The underlying shocks are not independent of one an-
other, making it almost impossible to interpret them 
economically. The identifi  cation approach used in this

Dataset on the Global VAR study
The dataset comprises variables that are 
typically used in macroeconomic models, as 
well as fi  nancial market variables. Specifi  c-
ally, it contains real gross domestic product 
(GDP), consumer prices, short-term money 
market rates, interest rates on long-term 
government bonds, real equity prices and bilateral real exchange rates with the US 
dollar. The majority of the dataset is based on Deés et al (2007). In addition, credit and corporate bond spreads – where available – 
are included for each country.1 Credit is 
comprised of loans to the non-fi  nancial pri-
vate sector and debt securities and is in-cluded in real terms (divided by the GDP 
defl  ator). Credit spreads are the difference 
between the interest on corporate bonds and that on ten-year government bonds.
2 
The sources of credit are the Basel Commit-
tee on Banking Supervision (2010),3 the 
International Financial Statistics of the Inter-national Monetary Fund (IMF) and national 
institutions. The data on interest rates on 
corporate bonds are provided by the Bank 
for International Settlements (BIS) and Da-
tastream.
A broad credit aggregate is used here be-
cause the study by the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (2010) revealed that 
 fi  nancial stress is indicated more effectively by such credit aggregates. Moreover, shocks 
originating from a broad credit segment may be expected to have a greater inter-national impact than shocks from a nar-rower segment. Corporate bond rates are 
preferred over bank lending rates since the latter do not exclusively refl  ect the price of 
credit but contain contractual elements, 
too. The observation period runs from 1983 to 2009.
The foreign aggregates x*
i,t are constructed 
using weights which are based on data on 
the bilateral links between country i and all other countries. Eickmeier and Ng (2011) studied the extent to which the goodness 
of fi  t of the model and the results are de-
pendent on the selected weights. The re-
sults of this study show that the estimated 
transmission of credit supply shocks is not 
infl  uenced signifi  cantly by the weights, but that a model which includes trade weights as well as bilateral inward foreign direct in-vestment (FDI) fi  ts the data relatively well. It 
is for this reason that trade weights are used to construct foreign aggregates for GDP and infl  ation, whereas inward FDI is used for the aggregation of foreign fi  nan-
cial market variables. Trade weights are de-fi  ned as the sum of export and import vol-
umes (on average over the period from 2005 to 2008), which are taken from the 
IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics. Bilateral 
FDI data are available for 2009 only and were drawn from the IMF’s Coordinated 
Direct Investment Survey.4
1 Interest rates and spreads are included in levels and 
all other variables as logarithms.2 Ten years is approximately the maturity of corporate bonds.3 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Guidance 
for national authorities operating the countercyclical 
buffer, December 2010.
4 Seven different weighting schemes were analysed. 
GDP and infl  ation are always aggregated using trade 
weights. For the aggregation of the remaining (fi  nan-cial market) variables trade weights, outward portfolio investment, inward portfolio investment, outward FDI, 
inward FDI, outward claims of domestically-domiciled 
banks and inward claims of foreign-domiciled banks 
are employed alternatively. It was found that both in-ward FDI and outward banks’ claims provide relatively 
good in-sample forecasts and low values of informa-
tion criteria. The goodness of fi  t of the models that use 
trade links exclusively is perceptibly poorer, while the 
goodness of fi  t of models that use foreign banks’ in-
ward claims, inward portfolio investment, outward portfolio investment or outward FDI is only slightly 
poorer. The most important results regarding the Ger-
man and international transmission of credit supply shocks, however, are not altered signifi  cantly by the 
choice of weighting scheme.Deutsche Bundesbank

“shocks” are initially defined as unexpected 
changes in an economy, or such changes not 
explained by the model. As error terms, they 
are initially impossible to interpret in economic 
terms. However, there are various ways of ul -
timately assigning shocks estimated from the 
model to events that can be interpreted from 
an economic standpoint. In this study, it is as -
sumed that a certain economic event sets sev -
eral variables in motion in certain directions. A 
shock which shows such defined characteristics 
can then be assigned to this economic event. 
Thus, for instance, in a simple model of a mar -
ket for a good, a (positive) supply shock in -
creases the quantity and lowers the price, 
whereas a demand shock increases the quan -
tity and price of the good in question. This 
logic is used to identify credit supply shocks in 
this much more complex model.
It is therefore of particular interest specifically 
to measure the effect of credit supply shocks 
on the real economy because a deterioration in 
the banks’ situation is seen as having triggered 
the crisis. Studies on numerous countries over a 
relatively long time horizon have also shown 
that there is a particularly close relationship be -
tween lending and the real economy and be -
tween various countries in terms of credit de -
velopments.3,4
Negative credit supply shocks are largely de -
fined here as shocks which cause a decline in 
lending and a simultaneous increase in lending 
rates and the credit risk premium. They can be 
caused, for instance, by a deterioration in col -
lateral quality or an increase in the probability 
of default5 or also by an exogenous decline in 
banks’ capital.6 However, they can also be trig -
gered by an increase in risk aversion of banks 
or other investors which is independent of 
credit defaults.7 Regulatory changes – such as 
with regard to capital or liquidity requirements 
– can also cause such a credit supply shock.8 
However, it is impossible to draw a further dis -
tinction between these potential causes of 
shocks. It is quite conceivable, though, that the 
identified German credit supply shocks can be associated more (or less) closely than US credit 
supply shocks with one or another of these as -
pects. This needs to be taken into account 
when comparing both types of shocks and 
their impact.
Transmission of domestic 
credit supply shocks  
to Germany
The chart on page 44 shows the impact of a 
German credit supply shock on the observed 
variables in Germany over the next 16 quarters. 
This is a “typical” shock, ie its size is one stand -
ard deviation. It causes the credit volume to de -
crease instantly by around 0.5%, with a max -
imum decline of 4% after three years. Credit 
spreads rise instantly by 0.1 percentage point, 
and the effect is likewise very persistent. The

effect on German GDP is significantly negative. 
GDP falls instantly after the onset of the shock 
by just under 0.2% and reaches its maximum 
decline of around 0.5% after three years.
Macroeconomic demand effects dominate 
macroeconomic supply effects, as not only 
GDP but also inflation falls, even though the 
statistical significance of this effect is marginal. 
Short and long-term interest rates also fall 
along with inflation. Monetary policy is there -
fore evidently loosened in response to a reduc -
tion in the credit supply or in inflation. Equity 
prices likewise fall temporarily, although this ef -
fect is statistically hardly significant. This is con -
sistent with diminished expectations for growth 
and an increase in the price of loans to enter -
prises resulting from higher credit spreads. 
Lastly – consistent with lower domestic interest 
rates – the German currency depreciates 
against the US dollar. The interest rate and ex -
change rate reactions have a positive impact 
on consumption, investment and exports in Germany and thus at least partly offset the 
negative effect of the deterioration in financing 
conditions.
Transmission of US credit 
supply shocks to Germany 
and other European 
 countries
The debate over the past few years has been 
centred on the global impact of a credit crunch 
triggered by problems in the US banking sys -
tem. Prior to studying these international trans -
missions of the US credit supply shock, how -
ever, it pays to look at their impact on the USA 
itself. This impact, in fact, is in many ways simi -
lar to that of the German credit supply shock 
on Germany (see chart above). A typical US 
shock is smaller than a typical German shock, 
measured in terms of the immediate response 
of credit spreads (0.05 percentage point) and 
credit (-0.25%). In these terms, the maximum Inflation, interest 
rates and equity prices likewise fall

decline of US GDP , at 0.2% after three quar -
ters, is remarkably sharp. The transmission of a 
shock standardised to the same size therefore 
has similar effects in Germany and the United 
States. However, there are, in fact, recognis -
able differences in the transmission channels of 
credit constraints to the respective economies: 
the significant decline in US inflation and the 
correspondingly much stronger decline in US 
interest rates (compared to Germany) mitigate 
the cyclical downturn caused by the negative 
credit supply shock in the USA. This effect has 
probably been made up for three factors: 
equity prices in the United States, which are 
typically more important to US consumers than 
German equities for German households, fell 
by nearly three times as much and more per -
sistently; the US dollar appreciated after the US 
shock (whereas the D-Mark and later the euro 
depreciated after the German shock); and the 
negative feedback effects owing to the stronger 
international transmission of the US shock were 
more pronounced.The effects of the US credit supply shock on 
Germany are very similar to those on the United 
States (see chart above). The impact on Ger -
man GDP is significantly negative and reaches a 
minimum of just under -1% after around two 
years. Remarkably, the effect on German GDP 
surpasses that on US GDP . This is consistent 
with studies which have a similar focus and use 
comparable methods.9
One possible explanation for this is that credit 
in Germany sustained a relatively sharp decline 
following a US shock. This effect is attributable 
to the response by internationally diversified in -
vestors and globally active US banks,10 which,

and a deterioration in their balance sheets, 
mainly scaled back their lending abroad – a 
phenomenon also discussed as the “inter -
national financial multiplier”.11
In both countries, inflation, interest rates and 
equity prices respond similarly strongly. The co-
movement between equity prices and long-
term interest rates is consistent with arbitrage 
mechanisms and confidence effects (which are 
difficult to measure).12 The depreciation of Ger -
many’s currency against the US dollar following 
the US shock, however, is likely to have miti -
gated the negative impact on Germany’s real 
economy and amplified that on the US real sec -
tor.
What is also interesting is how the US credit 
crunch impacts on the other European coun -
tries and whether this leads to disparities par -
ticularly within the euro area. This is shown by 
the chart on page 47 (compared to Germany).13 
The effects on the real economy in France, Italy, Spain or the United Kingdom are weaker 
than for Germany. By contrast, the responses in 
the other European countries (excluding Ger -
many) are barely distinguishable from one an -
other. A look at the developments in selected 
variables following the shocks sheds light on 
differences and similarities in the transmission 
mechanism. First, credit in the euro-area coun -
tries falls somewhat more sharply than in the 
United Kingdom, although only in Germany is 
this reflected in a stronger response of GDP . 
Second, long-term interest rates fall relatively 
sharply in Spain and Italy. This is one possible … and in equity 
prices; falling interest rates and euro depre-ciation against US dollar miti-gate negative effect

explanation of why the effects on Italian and 
Spanish GDP are less than those on German 
GDP . Third, the equity prices of all countries 
drop more or less in sync. Fourth, there is a 
“flight to safety” phenomenon, which mani -
fests itself in an appreciation of the US dollar 
against the pound sterling and, prior to 1999, 
the euro-area countries’ national currencies.
Lastly, German credit supply shocks have a 
much smaller impact on the real economy in 
other European countries than US credit supply 
shocks do.14 The differences within Europe are 
once again not particularly great, most likely 
because the European financial systems are 
tightly interwoven via the interbank market, in -
vestors’ shared customers, and global financial 
institutions.
The explanatory power  
of US and German credit 
supply shocks for the real 
economy
Not only the dynamic domestic and inter -
national impacts of the credit supply shocks are 
of interest but what importance such shocks 
have had in the past for real economic devel -
opments relative to other shocks. The table on 
page 48 shows the calculated percentage of 
GDP variation for which the two shocks are re -
sponsible.15 US credit supply shocks explain be -
tween 6% and 15% of GDP forecast error in 
the European countries. Germany is the most 
severely affected country. German credit supply 
shocks explain a much smaller percentage, be -
tween zero in the United States and 8% in Ger -
many itself. France and Italy are the countries 
affected most.German credit

Limitations of the analysis 
and additional findings  
from other research
The limitations of the approach used here show 
up in two particular areas. First, there are other 
types of financial market shocks – although 
these are not examined in depth in the analysis 
and, to a degree, are not well-modelled by the 
variables examined here – which could be ac -
tive alongside credit supply shocks. As a case in 
point, the recent crisis was characterised by a 
confluence of various shocks ranging from an 
unexpected drop in asset prices to a sudden 
drying-up of certain financial market segments. 
This would suggest studying more broadly de -
fined financial market shocks rather than a 
credit supply shock in isolation, as is done here. 
Second, the parameters of the multi-country 
model used here are assumed to be constant. 
However, various lines of thinking suggest that 
the transmission mechanism could have 
changed either permanently or at least inter -
mittently over time.
Only very few studies thus far have looked at 
time variation in the parameters and the im -
pact of more broadly defined financial market 
shocks on the real economy. Three very recent 
studies deserve particular mention here. Eick -meier et al (2011)16 look at shocks which im -
pact on an index of financial market conditions 
comprising 45 US financial market variables (in -
cluding credit aggregates, interest rates and 
spreads, monetary aggregates, credit condi -
tions obtained from surveys and asset prices). 
Hubrich and Tetlow (2011)17 and Holló et al 
(2011)18 look at indices composed of financial 
stress indicators (such as interest rate spreads, 
implied volatilities, correlations between inter -
est rates and asset prices) for the United States 
and the euro area. (No such studies specifically 
referring to Germany have been published yet.)
The latter two papers use a small VAR and dis -
tinguish between two regimes – financial stress 
phases and “normal” periods – under which 
the size of the financial market shocks and their 
transmission can differ. Eickmeier et al (2011) 
use a factor model for nine advanced econ -
omies to estimate how US financial market 
shocks impacted on the USA itself and inter -
nationally. Their model is additionally able to 
display lasting changes since the parameters 
change gradually, unlike in Hubrich and Tetlow 
(2011) and Holló et al (2011).
In some cases, it may be important to permit 
such variations to the model in order to ad -
equately measure the effects that are of inter -
est. It therefore seems plausible to assume 
that, in crisis periods, financial shocks hit a par -
ticularly large number of financial market seg -
ments at the same time or that credit defaults 
multiply; in models which permit changes to 
the size of the shock, this is reflected in very Credit supply 
shocks cover only part of  exogenous 
 financial market 
developments; the analysis 
does not 
 account for time 
variation in the parameters  eitherPaucity of 
 studies thus far

cial markets and real economy

large shocks.19 At the same time, it can be pre -
sumed that the transmission of shocks to the 
real economy is stronger during crisis periods 
than in periods of normality. The main reasons 
for such asymmetries lie in agency problems 
between lenders and borrowers. Such prob -
lems are more pronounced in crisis periods, 
which for their part can amplify the effects of 
shocks on the real economy. Agency problems 
occur, for instance, when collateralised loans 
are granted. When asset prices fall, lending is 
accordingly also constrained.20 Furthermore, 
greater information asymmetry between lend -
ers and borrowers in crisis periods can drive a 
wedge between the costs of equity and debt 
capital and drive up the costs of monitoring 
(known as a “financial accelerator”).21 More -
over, during crisis periods, households’ willing -
ness to hold illiquid funds diminishes. The de -
cline in deposits reduces the external funding 
that borrowers can draw upon (known as the 
“borrower’s balance sheet channel”).22,23 Lastly, 
structural changes in an economy are also a 
potential cause of permanent or gradual 
changes to parameters. It is argued, for in -
stance, that globalisation has made economic 
relationships closer and that financial market 
innovations have made it easier to access alter -
native forms of finance, thereby amplifying the 
role of the financial markets for the real econ -
omy. If the model does not allow such changes, 
this can lead to a distorted assessment of trans -
mission.
All three studies show, consistent with the 
above considerations, that financial shocks are 
particularly large in periods of crisis or stress. 
Eickmeier et al (2011) also find that the global 
financial and economic crisis is the largest post-
WWII financial shock.
What the last-listed study also finds is that the 
transmission of financial shocks (of the same 
size) to the US real economy increased in the 
early 1980s. The stated reason for this is a 
change in monetary policy, which led to an im -
proved anchoring of inflation expectations and 
consequently a less steep rise in short-term interest rates following positive financial 
shocks. The study finds that, for Germany (and 
most other euro-area countries in the study), 
transmission also gradually became stronger, a 
fact attributed to greater global financial mar -
ket integration. The contribution of US financial 
market shocks to explaining GDP growth in the 
United States and Germany ranges from negli -
gible in normal periods to 40% during the re -
cent crisis, which is higher than the 11% and 
15%, respectively, on average over the observa -
tion period, which the aforementioned GVAR 
analysis attributes to credit supply shocks (see 
the table on page 48).
The two studies which look at US shocks do 
not find any significant differences between cri -
sis periods and normal periods with regard to 
the transmission of similar-sized financial mar -
ket shocks. By contrast, Holló et al (2011) find, 
for the euro area, a strong and statistically 
highly significant real economic effect in 
periods of financial stress. During periods of 
calm, the effect is hardly significant.
Conclusions
In summary, US credit supply shocks can be 
said to significantly affect GDP in other coun -
tries. Credit squeezes in Germany are of some 
relevance particularly for Germany itself and for 
its European neighbours. The transmission of 
German credit supply shocks in Germany itself

19 At the same time, it must be conceded that models do 
a relatively poor job of reflecting crisis periods, irrespective 
of whether they have time-constant or time-varying par -
ameters; this likewise probably manifests itself in larger es -
timated shocks (or residuals).

occurs via a perceptible and persistent decline 
in credit, a rise in risk premiums and a short-
term decline in equity prices. These negative 
impacts on the real economy have been partly 
offset by a depreciation of the euro and a de -
cline in interest rates. US credit supply shocks 
are propagated internationally by a largely par -
allel deterioration in developments in the finan -
cial markets. The comovement of equity prices 
and long-term interest rates is consistent with 
arbitrage mechanisms and confidence effects. 
The sharp decline in loans is compatible with 
an “international financial multiplier”.
Credit supply shocks, however, are just a subset 
of the disruptions that emanate from the finan -
cial markets. In addition, the model underlying 
the analysis make the controversial assumption that the parameters are time-constant, even 
though there is evidence that the international 
propagation of financial market shocks has 
gradually grown stronger over time. Further ef -
forts will be necessary in the future to better 
understand the international and national ef -
fects of financial market disruptions. This is a 
key precondition for the development of suit -
able economic policy measures and instru -
ments to contain future crises and their reper -
cussions for the real economy. This includes, 
not least, identifying the gamut of specific fi -
nancial market shocks and modelling non-
linearities in the relationship between the indi -
vidual financial market variables as well as be -
tween financial market and real economic vari -
ables.Deutsche Bundesbank
