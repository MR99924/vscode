5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a whole
Overall economic activity slowed down per-
ceptibly following an exceptionally good start
to 2008. Real GDP in the second quarter was
down by a seasonally and calendar-adjusted
0.5% on the preceding three-month period,
compared with an increase of 1.3% in the
previous quarter. After adjustment for calen-
dar effects, however, economic output was
still 1.7% up on the figure for the corres-
ponding period last year. The quarter-on-
quarter decline was largely a technical reac-
tion to the very high level of output that had
been achieved earlier owing, not least, to
various special factors. Adverse cyclical
factors are, however, likely to have gained in
significance towards the middle of the year.
Private consumption showed a further de-
cline in the second quarter despite a positive
trend in the labour market and higher negoti-
ated wages in this year’s pay round. This was
due mainly to the renewed surges in the cost
of energy and persistently high food prices.
The negative price climate led not only to a
direct withdrawal of purchasing power, but
also to continuing marked restraint in con-
sumption. This was probably motivated by
the concern about sustained losses in real in-
come. The fact that the private saving ratio
remained at the high prior-quarter level of
11.3% is consistent with this picture.
As expected, construction investment de-
clined perceptibly in the second quarter after
increasing very sharply at the beginning ofGDP in 2008

6the year owing to the mild weather. Demand
for machinery and equipment also eased in
the second quarter following the marked
build-up of capacity over the past two and a
half years. Against a backdrop of exchange-
rate-induced losses in earnings, surges in the
cost of intermediate goods, and a sharp rise
in wage costs, enterprises are being more
cautious in making new acquisitions at
present. While real exports of goods and
services went down somewhat in the second
quarter, the decline, given a reduction in
inventory investment, was more pronounced
in the case of imports.
The value of exports of goods was lower in
July than in June, when a perceptible increase
was recorded. This contrasted with a sharp
rise in imports, which was due, not least, to
the sharp price rise in the oil markets. The
trade surplus went down by 36.4 billion to
311.8 billion. The surplus was also down in
real terms.
Industry
Industrial output in July fell by a seasonally
adjusted 2.0% on the month and was 0.3%
down on the year. The way in which public
holidays fell this year, with a comparatively
large number of holidays in July, is likely to
have generated some dampening effects in
the reporting period, however. Furthermore,
the decline in the production of motor
vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, at 6%, was
particularly marked. This is a continuation of
a development in this sector which had
already begun in the second quarter follow-
ing a sharp expansion in output at the start ofEconomic conditions in Germany*

7the year. The other capital goods producers
also incurred obvious losses in July.
Orders received fell by a seasonally adjusted
1.7% in July, compared with a decline of2.6% in June. While export orders – with theexception of a very small increase in May –started to pick up again somewhat (+0.8%)for the first time since November 2007, do-mestic orders recorded a sharp decline(3.6%). This mainly affected capital goods.Orders of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers fell by as much as 11.4%. In additionto the high fuel prices, the debate about thereform of motor vehicle tax in Germany aswell as the planned EU climate protectionprovisions are likely to have had a negativeimpact here.
ConstructionConstruction output fell by a seasonally ad-
justed 2.0% in July following what had beenquite a sharp decline of 2.4% in June. At theend of the period under review, constructionactivity was down on the already low levelof the previous year. General constructionwas affected less severely by the slowdownthan civil engineering. Orders received inJune remained at the depressed level of theprevious month. One contributory factor inthis was the reluctance of the public sector toplace new orders; in the second quarter,public sector orders were 14% down on thefirst quarter.Labour market
The labour market situation has been tending
to show further improvement. The seasonallyadjusted number of persons in employmentwent up by 37,000 in July. The year-on-yearrise was 1.4%. There was a very sharpgrowth in jobs subject to social security con-tributions. According to the estimates of theFederal Employment Agency, the increase inJune was 2.2% compared with the sameperiod last year. There was a distinct fall inthe Ifo employment barometer, which reflectsthe situation in the production sector and intrade. There was also a further decline, albeitfrom a high level, in the number of job vacan-cies reported to the Federal Labour Agency.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment showed a
marked fall to 3.20 million in August. Theseasonally adjusted unemployment ratestood at 7.6%, compared with 7.7% in July.This represents a decline of 1.2 percentagepoints on the year. The number of un-employed persons receiving the basic allow-ance for job seekers has therefore fallen byaround 100,000 since the beginning of thesecond quarter, compared with around35,000 in the case of the statutory insurancescheme.

8demand for oil in the industrial countries and
to the expansion of production by the OPEC
countries. Second, the short-term upward
and downward fluctuations can also be seen
as a sign of speculative exaggerations. This
was followed by further supply-side risks for a
time owing to the conflict in the Caucasus
and the threat to the oil infrastructure in the
Gulf of Mexico posed by hurricanes “Gustav”
and “Ike”. Given that the latter did not cause
any major damage, the price went down to
US$933/C254at the end of the period under
review. In the futures markets, a premium of
US$41/C254was charged for six-month deliveries;
the figure for 18-month deliveries was
US$63/C254.
Import prices in July showed a further sharp
rise on the month at a seasonally adjusted
0.3%. At 9.3%, the year-on-year rate was
0.4 percentage point higher than in June. Ex-
cluding energy, the increase was 1.4%. The
cost of domestically produced industrial
goods in August was a seasonally adjusted
0.5% down on the month and 8.1% up on
the year. Even if energy is excluded, there
were distinct price increases on the year
(3.4%).
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices went
down slightly in August after going up con-
siderably in July. Fuel and heating oil became
markedly cheaper, whereas the cost of gas
and electricity increased. Seasonally adjusted
food prices showed a comparatively sharp
rise, while the prices of services went up only
slightly. In the case of industrial goods, the
longer survey period meant that some of the
price rises which are usually recorded in Sep-tember after the end of the summer sales
were already effective in August. The year-
on-year increase in the national consumer
price index (CPI) fell from 3.3% to 3.1% in
August. The corresponding figure for the Har-
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was
3.3%, compared with 3.5% in July.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance scheme re-
corded a small surplus in the second quarter
of 2008. However, this constitutes a signifi-
cant financial deterioration of almost 31 bil-
lion on the year. In the first quarter of 2008,
the budgetary position was only just under
31/C252billion down on the figure for 2007. A
rise in expenditure of 5% was accompanied
by an overall increase in revenue of just over
21/C252%. Revenue from contributions rose by
just over 3%. The total amount of income
subject to contributions (basic wage total) in-
creased by 23/C254% and, at 14.87%, the aver-
age contribution rate was somewhat higher
than last year (14.80%). The basic wage total
fell short of gross wages and salaries (almost
+4%) mainly as a result of the far slower in-
crease in total pensions and the fact that
growth in the number of employed persons
has been offset by a decline in the recipients

9of unemployment benefit, for whom contri-
butions are also paid. The Federal grantamounted to 31
1/C254billion, as in 2007.
Spending on benefits rose by 51/C252% overall.
At almost 4%, expenditure on hospital treat-ment, which alone accounts for one-third ofthe statutory health insurance budget, in-creased sharply again. Spending on pharma-ceuticals went up by almost 7%, with the risein the standard rate of VAT from 16% to19% on 1 January 2007 now playing virtuallyno role in increasing expenditure. With an in-crease of almost 4
1/C252% or 9% respectively,
outlays for outpatient treatment and sicknessbenefit also expanded significantly. Overall,spending on benefits grew at a much fasterpace than revenue.
Owing to the ongoing favourable labour mar-
ket situation, the relatively large negotiatedwage increases and also the higher averagecontribution rate, the positive revenue trend isexpected to continue into the second half of2008. However, given the marked growth inexpenditure, a surplus is highly unlikely in2008. Although health insurance institutions’debts should have largely been eliminated and,in many cases, reserves should have alreadybeen built up again, the growing gap betweenthe revenue base and spending on benefits isexpected to put further pressure on the contri-bution rates and this could prove problematic.
Furthermore, exceptional increases in ex-
penditure are expected in 2009. In itself, theestablishment of a health insurance fund on1 January 2009 is hardly linked to any add-itional expenditure. However, there are newarrangements for outpatient doctors’ remu-
neration.
2The agreement on the benchmarks
for the remuneration of medical services,which was reached at the end of August, islikely to lead to additional expenditure of justover 32
1/C252billion in 2009. Furthermore, a Fed-
eral Government legislative initiative envis-ages considerable additional financial re-sources for hospitals.

2Owing to budgeting, the price of a benefit has general-
ly been determined up to now ex post. In the future, re-
muneration rates are to be determined ex ante, which
means that extensions of the range of benefits provided
will have a direct effect on the volume of expenditure.
Possible spending growth is to be curbed by specifying
standard benefit volumes. If these are exceeded, the re-
muneration rates are to be lowered progressively.

10in the Federal grant of 31.5 billion is not
enough to offset the politically influenced
cost increases. Consequently, the uniform
contribution rate, which the Federal Govern-
ment has to set by 1 November 2008, will
have to be raised significantly above the cur-
rent average rate of just over 14.9%. The uni-
form contribution rate initially aims to ensure
that 100% of health insurance expenditure
can be covered by the new health insurance
fund. Future rate increases are envisaged only
if there is a danger of the cover ratio falling
below 95%.
Public long-term care insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme
recorded a small deficit in the second quarter
of 2008, as it had done one year previously.While expenditure grew by nearly 4%, total
revenue was almost 3% up on the year. As a
result of the favourable employment trend
and higher per capita earnings, employed
persons’ contributions rose by almost 41/C252%.
By contrast, contribution payments made on
behalf of recipients of unemployment benefit
fell sharply again (-10%). Pensioners paid
only just under 1% more to long-term care
insurance institutions overall. On the expend-
iture side, the sharp increase in the funds re-
quired for non-financial benefits (+41/C252%) and
slower growth in expenditure on financial
benefits (+3%) continued. The deficit for the
first six months of 2008 as a whole amounted
to just over 31/C254billion. At the end of June,
the liquid reserves of the public long-term
care insurance scheme amounted to just over
323/C254billion.
The nursing care reform entered into force on
1 July 2008 and the general contribution rate
rose from 1.7% to 1.95% (plus, where ap-
plicable, the special contribution of 0.25% to
be paid by the childless). The associated add-
itional revenue will exceed the planned costly
extension of benefits (notably, the dynamis-
ing of long-term care benefit rates4and add-
itional benefits, eg for those suffering from
dementia) in the coming years and will tem-
porarily lead to surpluses as well as to a cer-
tain build-up of reserves. However, in the
long term, it is foreseeable that the funda-Quarterly

4Following discretionary adjustments to the long-term
care benefit rates planned for 1 July 2008, 1 January
2010 and 1 January 2012, the long-term care benefit
rates are to be reviewed every three years from 2014 to
establish whether they should be adjusted in line with cu-
mulative price developments. If real wage and salary de-
creases occur, then benefit rates are to be adjusted at
most in line with nominal increases in gross wages.Deficit at same

11mental negatives in the public long-term
care insurance scheme (declining number of
contribution payers in employment, growing
number of long-term care patients, and now
also rising benefit rates) will far outweigh the
additional revenue owing to rising per capita
earnings. This means that contribution rates
for this branch of the social security system
are bound to rise in future.
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market
increased slightly in July in comparison with
June. Domestic bonds with a total value of
3147.2 billion were issued in the German
market, compared with 3144.5 billion in
June. After deducting redemptions and
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings
of their own bonds, net sales came to 311.3
billion, compared with 36.1 billion in the
preceding month. The outstanding amount
of foreign debt securities in the German
market increased by 31.3 billion; on balance,
this consisted exclusively of euro-denomin-
ated securities.
In the reporting month, German credit insti-
tutions alone saw inflows of new investible
funds in the amount of 321.2 billion net from
their bond market issues. Most activity was
focused on the sale of other bank debt
securities which can be structured especially
flexibly ( 321.2 billion). In addition, the out-
standing volume of mortgage Pfandbriefe
increased slightly ( 32.0 billion), while paperissued by specialised credit institutions, some
of which are guaranteed by the government,
as well as public Pfandbriefe were redeemed
on balance ( 31.9 billion and 30.1 billion
respectively).
Against the backdrop of a good cash balance
situation, the public sector, by contrast,
redeemed bond market liabilities to the net
value of 311.6 billion in July. Central govern-
ment reduced the outstanding volume of its
own paper by 313.5 billion overall. This in-
cluded the redemption of Treasury discount
paper (Bubills) ( 31.5 billion) and Federal sav-
ings notes ( 30.1 billion); however, the repay-
ment of a maturing large-volume ten-year
bond issue worth 322.5 billion was the most
significant factor. By contrast, central govern-
ment issued thirty-year Federal bondsSales and purchases

worth a total of 310.3 billion and generated
30.2 billion through the first-time sale of
“overnight bonds for private investors”. State
governments raised 31.9 billion net in the
capital market.
In the reporting month, German enterprises
on balance preferred to incur long-term debt.
They issued mainly bonds ( 31.4 billion) while
increasing the outstanding volume of short-
term money market paper only slightly ( 30.2
billion).
In July, debt securities were purchased on
balance primarily by non-resident investors,
who invested 310.6 billion in the German
bond market. Domestic investors added Ger-
man and foreign interest-bearing paper
worth 32.0 billion to their portfolios. Of this
amount, 31.5 billion was attributable to
German non-banks and 30.5 billion to credit
institutions.
Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
almost came to a standstill in July. New shares
totalling only 30.2 billion were placed in the
market; the majority of them were issued by
listed enterprises. At the same time, the out-
standing volume of foreign equities in the
German market fell by approximately the
same amount ( 30.2 billion). German non-
banks were the principal buyers ( 37.0 billion),
investing primarily in domestic equities ( 35.6
billion). By contrast, in the reporting month,
German credit institutions were predominant-ly on the sellers’ side for both domestic and
foreign equities ( 33.0 billion). Foreign invest-
ors also sold German equities totalling 34.0
billion net.
Mutual fund shares
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded a
moderate inflow of 30.5 billion. Although
investors withdrew capital ( 30.3 billion) from
mutual funds open to the general public and
particularly from interest-bearing financial
products (bond-based funds and money mar-
ket funds), specialised funds reserved for in-
stitutional investors generated 31.4 billion.
The assets managed by mixed funds in par-
ticular increased markedly ( 39.2 billion), while
mutual funds bought back shares in mixed
securities-based funds worth a total of 37.6
billion. In July, resident non-banks were the
sole purchasers of mutual fund shares ( 33.1
billion), investing predominantly in German
products ( 32.8 billion). By contrast, German
credit institutions and foreign investors sold
share certificates for 31.8 billion net and 30.8
billion net respectively.
Balance of payments
In July, the surplus on Germany’s current ac-
count – in unadjusted terms – fell to 311.8
billion and was thus down on the month by
37.1 billion. This was attributable mainly to a
smaller trade surplus. There was also a rise in
the deficit on invisible current transactions,
which comprise services, income and current
transfers.Corporate

13According to provisional figures from the
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign tradesurplus in July decreased by 36.0 billion on
the month to 313.9 billion. After adjustment
for seasonal and calendar variations, it fell by36.4 billion to 311.8 billion. The value of
exports declined by 1.7% while the value ofimports rose by 7.4%. Compared with thesecond-quarter average, seasonally adjustednominal exports decreased slightly (-0.2%); inreal terms, however, they recorded a greaterdecline. Imports rose by 7.3%; however,around one-third of this increase was causedby higher prices, especially for energy andother commodities.
In July, the deficit on invisible current trans-
actions grew to 31.3 billion compared with
30.3 billion in June. The expansion in the def-
icit on services by 30.8 billion to 32.6 billion,
largely on account of the holidays, and the in-crease in net expenditure on current transfersby30.6 billion to 32.7 billion both played a
role in this development. By contrast, theincome balance surplus increased to 34.0 bil-
lion, compared with 33.6 billion in the
previous month.
There were again net capital imports resulting
from cross-border portfolio investment in July.However, at 36.7 billion, these were consider-
ably lower than in June ( 326.6 billion). The
main reason for this decline was that non-resident investors purchased considerablyfewer German securities ( 35.8 billion) than in
the previous month ( 339.0 billion). Their net
demand was for debt securities ( 310.6 bil-
lion), primarily in the form of private sectorbonds ( 39.5 billion). By contrast, they dis-Major items of the balance

vestors reduced their foreign investment by
30.9 billion. Residents sold foreign shares
(31.6 billion) and mutual fund shares ( 30.5
billion) and acquired debt securities issued by
non-residents ( 31.3 billion).
In the area of direct investment, there were
net capital outflows in July ( 311.4 billion,
compared with 316.5 billion in June). This
was due mainly to the withdrawal by foreign
proprietors of 37.8 billion in funds from their
German affiliates. These funds were largely
repayments of loans previously granted by
the foreign parent companies to their Ger-
man subsidiaries. Foreign direct investment
by German companies amounted to 33.6 bil-
lion in July.In July, other statistically recorded investment
comprising financial and trade credits (in as
much as these do not constitute a part of
direct investment) as well as bank deposits
and other assets saw net inflows of 39.5 bil-
lion compared with outflows of 346.5 billion
in the previous month. These were attribut-
able to non-bank transactions ( 38.7 billion).
Capital imports by general government
amounting to 321.6 billion – realised mainly
through a reduction in short-term bank de-
posits abroad – were offset by capital exports
by enterprises and households to the value of

inflows of 30.8 billion. While credit institu-
tions experienced outflows of 32.1 billion,

15The performance
of German credit
institutions in 2007The performance of German credit in-
stitutions in the financial year 2007
was shaped crucially by the financial
market turbulence. This especially af-
fected the group of special purpose
banks, in which one institution carried
out risk-shielding measures for its sub-
sidiary. The financial market turmoil
also clearly left its mark on the income
statement of the Landesbanken, re-
gional institutions of credit coopera-
tives, and big banks. By contrast, the
performance of the regional banks,
savings banks and credit cooperatives
remained largely unaffected. In oper-
ational business, German banks as a
whole benefited from a moderate in-
crease in net interest received and, for
almost all categories of banks, a rise in
net commissions received. As in previ-
ous years, net interest received de-
creased only for the savings banks and
credit cooperatives, who are both pre-
dominantly active in retail business,
while their income from commission
business continued to rise. On aggre-
gate, however, a noticeable decline in
the net result from own-account trad-
ing and from other operating income
led to decreasing net income from op-
erational business. The significant rise
in valuation charges also posed an
additional strain, leading to a fall in
German banks’ operating result in the
reporting year.

16Net interest received
In 2007, domestic credit institutions were
once again able to increase their net interest
received – ie the difference between interest
income and expenses – by 32.4 billion to
391.5 billion. However, interest expenses
went up by 22.0% to 3327.4 billion and thus
to a relatively greater degree than interest in-
come (with a rise of 17.2% to 3418.9 billion).
The share of the interest result in operating
income from net interest received and net
commissions received as well as the result
from own-account trading and net other
operating income or charges increased by
4.7 percentage points to 72.9%. By contrast,
the interest margin – calculated as net inter-
est received in relation to the average balance
sheet total – declined again, amounting to1.12% in the reporting year, compared with
1.15% in 2006.
Among the individual categories of banks, it
was especially the big banks that recorded a
rise in net interest received. Their share of the
total operating income therefore increased by
5.7 percentage points to 65.7% and was
thus significantly above the average of the
past ten years (57.1%). The banks more spe-
cialised in wholesale banking also reported a
significant rise in net interest received. Lan-
desbanken and regional institutions of credit
cooperatives noticeably increased their net
interest received. The category of regional
banks also increased its net interest received
last year, namely by 8.8%.
By contrast, those categories of banks for
which classical lending and deposit business
is traditionally very important mostly had to
accept another decline in net income from
this area. In the case of credit cooperatives,
net interest received declined by 3.6%, which
was on a scale similar to the previous year.
However, since other operating income de-
creased to a far greater degree, the share of
interest business in operating income went
up to 71.3%, compared with 65.2% in the
previous year. The savings banks recorded an
even more obvious year-on-year decline in
their net interest received. It fell by 6.7% in
the reporting year and was thus at its lowest
level since 1993. The share of net interest
received in operating income dropped by
2.6 percentage points to 75.1%, thus reach-
ing its lowest level since 1968.DM bn € bn

17Net commissions received
German banks again boosted their net com-
missions received by 6.1% to 331.7 billion in
2007, after already achieving a very good re-
sult in the previous year. However, owing to
the larger balance sheet, net commissions re-
ceived as a percentage of the volume of busi-
ness remained unchanged at 0.39%. The im-
portance of net commissions received for the
operational business of German credit institu-
tions increased again perceptibly in the finan-
cial year 2007. The share of this item in oper-
ating income increased by 2.4 percentage
points to 25.2%.
For the main part, the further improvement in
net commissions received is likely to be due
to the fact that the stock market climate wasstill very positive in the first half of 2007.
Overall, turnover in shares in the German
stock markets rose by 45.3% in 2007. Except
for the regional institutions of credit coopera-
tives, all categories of banks showed higher
net commissions received – albeit to a varying
extent. For example, commercial banks, in
particular, increased their net commissions re-
ceived by 7.6%, with big banks still account-
ing for the greatest part. However, a larger in-
crease – in both percentage and absolute
terms – was recorded by regional banks. In
their case, the difference between commis-
sions received and commissions paid went up
by 12.7%. This increased the share of net
commissions received in their operating in-
come by 2.0 percentage points to 31.3%. By

18up a large part of the operating result, the
share increased by only 1.1 percentage points
to 30.5% in the reporting year.
As savings banks and credit cooperatives
have been increasing their net commissions
received since the beginning of the decade,
this income component is now of some im-
portance for them, too. Compared with the
commercial banks, the continued growth for
these two categories of banks was, however,
rather moderate at 3.9% and 4.8% respect-
ively. In the period under review, savings
banks’ net commissions received constituted
21.8% of operating income, compared with
20.3% in the previous year. For credit co-
operatives, this ratio was 22.3% in the finan-
cial year 2007, which corresponds to a rise of
3.6 percentage points. The Landesbankenalso recorded a small growth in income from
commission business, while the regional insti-
tutions of credit cooperatives sustained sig-
nificant losses.
Net profit or net loss on financial
operations
In contrast to net commissions received, the
overall net result from own-account trading
was influenced less by the positive develop-
ment in the stock markets in the first half of
2007. Instead, it was noticeably affected by
write-offs and write-downs in the trading
books in the wake of the financial market tur-
bulence in the second half of the year. As a
result, net income from German credit institu-
tions’ own-account trading decreased by
35.6 billion to - 31.1 billion in the financial
year 2007.
In the reporting year, the big banks still re-
corded a surplus of 31.8 billion in own-
account trading, even though write-offs and
write-downs in their trading portfolio in the
wake of the financial market turbulence led
to a 31.2 billion decline in the net profit on
financial operations. Thus, the share of own-
account trading in operating income dropped
by 3.4 percentage points to 4.7%. Landes-
banken and regional institutions of credit co-
operatives, whose financial operations gener-
ally also make a significant contribution to
the profit, ended the financial year 2007 with
losses in own-account trading, in fact: write-
offs and write-downs in the wake of the
financial market turbulence led to a decline
of30.9 billion to - 30.5 billion in the tradingAs a percentage of the balance sheet total

market turbulence as well as the losses arising
from the stock trading of one institution con-
tributed to a slump of 32.7 billion in the trad-
ing result to - 31.7 billion. Regional banks, for
which own-account trading admittedly plays
a rather subordinate role, also recorded a de-
cline of their net profits on financial oper-
ations in the financial year 2007. By contrast,
savings banks and credit cooperatives, for
which the trading result is likewise of minor
importance for operating income, were still
able to benefit from slightly positive net in-
come from own-account trading, even
though it was somewhat lower than in theprevious year for these two categories of
banks.
Administrative spending
Domestic credit institutions’ administrative
spending, at 381.6 billion in the financial
year 2007, was at much the same level as in
2006. Despite a small rise in the number of
employees for the first time since 2000, Ger-
man banks benefited from slightly declining
staff costs. While other administrative spend-
ing – which mainly includes operating ex-
penditure, expenditure on third-party ser-
vices, and write-offs and write-downs of tan-
gible fixed assets – went up by 4.1% to 337.0

20lion, probably owing to declining variable and
performance-related salary components.
Big banks’ administrative spending decreased
slightly by 0.5%, with the staff costs of this
category of banks showing a decline while
other administrative spending rose. The re-
gional banks, however, recorded a rise in
both staff costs and other administrative
spending, which ultimately led to a notice-
able 6.9% increase in their total administra-
tive costs. By contrast, both the regional insti-
tutions of credit cooperatives and the Landes-
banken lowered their total administrative
spending in the reporting year 2007 by 8.7%
and 5.2% respectively. Following a rise in
staff costs in 2006, both categories of banks
clearly reduced their staff costs again in the fi-nancial year 2007, while other administrative
spending increased.
The banks active in retail business also record-
ed declining staff costs. However, in the case
of the savings banks, the 3.0% fall in staff
costs was more than offset by a 9.7% in-
crease in other administrative spending, thus
ultimately resulting in a 1.9% rise in overall
administrative spending for this category of
banks. In the case of the credit cooperatives,
however, there was a fall not only in staff
costs but also in other administrative spend-
ing, leading to an overall decline in adminis-
trative costs of 3.5%.Structural data on German credit institutions*

21Net other operating income or charges
Having made an extremely positive contribu-
tion to profit in 2006, which was due to a
one-off effect (corporation tax balances
being shown as assets), net other operating
income or charges returned to normal again
in the reporting year. In 2007, it amounted to
33.5 billion, which was still slightly above the
average of the years 2000 to 2005.
After a sharp rise in 2006, particularly owing
to the sale of participating interests, other op-
erating income or charges of credit coopera-
tives went back down to its normal level in
the financial year 2007 ( 31.1 billion). The big
banks, too, recorded a noticeable decline in
other operating income or charges in the re-
porting year, whereas this item had boosted
profits in 2006. According to the published
annual reports, this was due mainly to the
fact that, in the wake of the financial market
turbulence, one big German bank recorded
marked losses and write-downs on financial
instruments in this income and charges cat-
egory. In the case of the regional banks, how-
ever, net other income or charges had a posi-
tive effect on the operating result, even
though this category of banks also had to
cope with a slight decline here. For the Lan-
desbanken, the extremely positive contribu-
tion made in the previous year was also fol-
lowed by a noticeable return to normal in
other operating income or charges from 31.0
billion to 30.5 billion. By contrast, net other
operating income or charges of the regional
institutions of credit cooperatives remained
almost unchanged. Only the savings banks re-
corded a slight rise in this area.Cost/income ratios, by category

22Operating result before the valuation of
assets
In the financial year 2007, the operating re-
sult before the valuation of assets declined
noticeably from 349.2 billion to 344.0 billion.
Most categories of banks had to cope with a
decline, but this was most pronounced for
the Landesbanken and credit cooperatives. In
the case of the credit cooperatives, the
marked decline was due to a normalisation
following the one-off effect of the previous
year, while one institution’s loss from own-
account trading was a key factor in the weak-
ening of the operating result in the case of
the Landesbanken. By contrast, the improve-
ment in net interest received at the big and
regional banks was also reflected in a slightincrease in the operating result before the
valuation of assets.
Relative to gross income, which is the sum of
net interest received and net commissions re-
ceived, German credit institutions were able
to improve their cost/income ratio in 2007.
The ratio of administrative spending to the
sum of net interest received and net commis-
sions received dropped by 2.3 percentage
points to 66.2%. However, since the losses
from own-account trading put a strain on op-
erating income, and other operating income
or charges remained well below the previous
year’s level, the cost/income ratio relative to
total income from operational business in-
creased by 2.7 percentage points to 65.0%.

Net income or net charges from the
valuation of assets
In 2007, German credit institutions’ net
charges from the valuation of loans, claims
and securities increased sharply overall. At
323.5 billion, it was considerably up on the
previous year’s level of 314.0 billion,1al-
though it failed to match the record high of
2002 ( 331.2 billion). As a ratio of the balance
sheet total, the net valuation charges of the
German institutions amounted to 0.29% in
2007, compared with 0.18% in the previous
year. However, the sharp rise in the overall
aggregate was due mainly to a very sharp
growth in valuation charges in the case of
special purpose institutions, which went up
from 30.6 billion in 2006 to 37.8 billion in the
reporting year. This rise was very largely con-
centrated on a single bank and reflects its
risk-shielding measures in favour of a subsid-
iary in connection with the financial market
turbulence.2In addition, it was, in particular,
also the Landesbanken3and the regional in-
stitutions of credit cooperatives that recorded
a marked increase in their net valuation
charges. The big banks also recorded a some-
what higher risk provisioning in the reporting
year.4At the same time, the net valuation
charges of the regional banks remained virtu-
ally unchanged. They were lower for savings
banks and, especially, for credit cooperatives,
although the latter had to cope with marked-
ly higher valuation charges in 2006 than in
previous years.In 2007, a major part of the risk provisioning
of German credit institutions is again likely to
have been accounted for by domestic lending
business, although the declining number of
corporate insolvencies should have had an al-
leviating effect. Their decline by 15% to
around 29,000 cases was the sharpest since
2003. The sum of claims likely to be associ-
ated with them also fell on roughly the same
scale. Moreover, the 9% rise in consumer in-
solvencies to just over 105,000 was clearly
below the earlier growth rates of more than
40% for the first time since the introduction
of the Insolvency Code ( Insolvenzordnung )o f
1999. The increase in affected claims also
more or less corresponded to the rise in con-
sumer insolvencies.5The development in con-
sumer insolvencies, however, is less signifi-
cant for risk provisioning owing to the smaller
percentage of loans to households in overall
lending.
1Within these items, the respective institutions had al-
ready made use of the cross-offsetting option permissible
under section 340 (f) (3) of the German Commercial
Code.
2According to data from the published annual report.
3The year-on-year increase was especially high, owing,
among other things, to net valuation income of 31.4 bil-
lion shown in 2006. According to the published annual
report, this net valuation income mainly resulted from
the conversion of the undisclosed reserves contained in
the net income or net charges from the valuation of
assets pursuant to section 340 (f) of the German Com-
mercial Code into disclosed reserves pursuant to section
340 (g), which are not reflected in a reduction of the an-
nual surplus, but are part of the profit appropriation (ac-
cumulation of reserves).
4The net income of the big banks was bolstered signifi-
cantly by one institution that – according to data from its
annual report – achieved a positive balance of 31.4 billion
from the liquidation of loss provisions and contingency
reserves and from realisation gains from sales of “non-
strategic shareholding”. This institution simultaneously
had to cope with considerable net charges from financial
operations in connection with the financial market turbu-
lence.

24By contrast, the significant rise in net valu-
ation charges is due mainly to the compon-
ents of risk provisioning, which reflect the fi-
nancial market turbulence. The further and
very distinct rise in write-downs on fixed-
interest securities, which are partly recorded
here, from 33.1 billion in 2006 to 34.9 billion
in the reporting year should be seen mainly
against this background. According to some
institutions, expansions of the issuers’ credit
spread necessitated extensive valuation ad-
justments for liquidity reserve paper. This
was counteracted by the fact that some
banks – according to data from published an-
nual reports for 2007 – reduced contingency
reserves (pursuant to section 340 (f) of the
German Commercial Code) on a considerable
scale, which are offset against valuation
losses in the net valuation charges.In view of the greatly increased net valuation
charges of some institutions in connection
with the financial market turbulence, the op-
erating result after valuation was noticeably
lower than before valuation and fell by 42%
to320.5 billion. However, a significant part
of this decline was accounted for by the spe-
cial purpose banks. Excluding these banks,
the operating result fell by 22%.
Apart from the special purpose banks, it was,
in particular, the regional institutions of credit
cooperatives and the Landesbanken that had
to cope with a considerable decline in their
operating result. In the case of the Landes-
banken, however, this was due in part to the
comparatively high result of the previous
year. According to the published annual re-
ports, one-off effects from the sale of share-
holdings had been one key factor in achieving
this result. Credit cooperatives and savings
banks suffered noticeably smaller losses in
the operating result, although the credit co-
operatives had also benefited from one-off
effects from the sale of shareholdings and the
carrying of corporation tax balances as assets
in the previous year; these effects distort the
year-on-year comparison. The operating re-
sult of the big banks also declined slightly,
while the regional banks recorded a small
rise.

25in a valuation that is less oriented to tempor-
ary market fluctuations. The higher losses
and write-downs published for some German
groups of institutions in connection with the
financial market turbulence are typically
based on more broadly defined balance
sheets and other valuation standards (IFRS).
Other and extraordinary income or
charges
For the first time since 2002, the balance on
the “extraordinary account” in the reporting
year 2007 did not put a strain on the profit
and loss accounts of German banks. For all
categories of banks combined, the balance
remained even, compared with - 37.6 billion
in 2006. The positive result from financial in-vestment business ( 35.1 billion) was crucial
for the marked improvement in the “extraor-
dinary account”. This was due almost solely
to the sale of subsidiaries and branches by a
single institution.6Moreover, the balance of
extraordinary income and charges in the nar-
rower sense (+ 30.8 billion) boosted the fig-
ure, compared with an adverse effect (- 31.7
billion) in the previous year. The transferred
profits had a detrimental effect on the result
similar to that in the previous year. Further-
more, both loss transfers and net charges for
transfers to the special item with an equity
portion increased in the reporting year.Breakdown of other and extraordinary income or charges*

26The “extraordinary account” improved in
2007 mainly in the case of the commercial
banks. This was due, above all, to the very
positive contribution of one big bank owing
to the above-mentioned individual transac-
tions amounting to 36.8 billion. By compari-
son, however, the scale of the aggregated
changes remained limited for the other cat-
egories of banks under consideration here. It
was only the special purpose banks whose
“extraordinary account” was subjected to a
noticeably greater strain in 2007 than in the
previous year; however, this burden was con-
centrated on only one institution and, accord-
ing to the published annual report, was to be
recorded under financial investment business
in connection with the financial market tur-
bulence. The regional institutions of the credit
cooperatives were able to offset burdens inthe extraordinary account in the narrower
sense as well as in the case of loss transfers
with significant income from financial invest-
ment business.7At the same time, there were
fewer burdens for the regional banks in the
reporting year, which was due mainly to sup-
porting effects from financial investment
business as well as from the extraordinary ac-
count in the narrower sense.
Profit for the financial year, taxes on
income and earnings
The total profit for the financial year before
tax reported by the German banking industry
declined from 327.6 billion in 2006 to 320.5
billion in 2007. In line with this, the return on
equity (before tax) also fell from 9.35% in
2006 to 6.56% in 2007. This primarily reflect-
ed the particular strains on one special pur-
pose bank as a result of its risk-shielding
measures in favour of a subsidiary bank. The
markedly more favourable development of
the “extraordinary account” compared with
the previous year – sustained essentially, as
mentioned above, by the significant positive
contribution of one institution – meant that
the decline, as an aggregate, was clearly less
than for the operational result. All in all, most
categories of banks recorded a decline in
their profit for the financial year. In the case

27and the regional institutions of credit co-
operatives (- 30.4 billion compared with
+30.4 billion), this was mainly the result of
the dramatic increase in valuation charges inconnection with the financial market tur-bulence. Commercial banks, by contrast,showed an increase in their profit for thefinancial year (from 310.1 billion to 318.7
billion). This principally reflects the above-mentioned income from sales of subsidiariesby a single institution in the amount of 36.8
billion. However, even after adjustment forthe mentioned individual transactions, theystill recorded a slight increase in their profitfor the financial year.
Taxes on income and earnings went up from
35.4 billion to 36.0 billion in the reporting
year. However, the year-on-year comparisonis distorted by positive one-off effects owing
to corporation tax balances being shown asassets in 2006. These effects were reflected indifferent items in the profit and loss accountsamong the individual categories of banks.

In the financial year 2007, income from li-quidations from the “fund for general bank-ing risks”, on balance, improved the profit by33.7 billion, although this was attributable

28had amounted to as much as 35.3 billion. On
balance, 34.2 billion (2006: 36.0 billion)
flowed to the accumulation of reserves and
participation rights capital. However, this al-
ready includes the indirect effects of the
aforementioned one-off effect in the case of
the big banks; according to the published an-
nual report, this bank alone booked 34.1 bil-
lion in “other revenue reserves” with a detri-
mental impact on profits. The losses carried
forward reduced the balance sheet profit by
30.8 billion, compared with 30.5 billion in the
previous year. Overall, the German banks
show balance sheet profits of 313.2 billion in
2007, compared with 310.4 billion in 2006.
However, this should not disguise the fact
that the profitability of banks in Germany
worsened significantly during 2007.
Outlook
In the current financial year, the negative re-
percussions of the financial market turbu-
lence on the profitability of domestic credit
institutions are likely to become more severe.
A further strain on net income from the valu-
ation of assets is to be expected, especiallyfor the big banks, the Landesbanken and the
regional institutions of credit cooperatives.
Moreover, the weak stock market environ-
ment and the small number of initial public
offerings and corporate mergers are likely to
have an adverse impact on net commissions
received and the result from own-account
trading. At the same time, the German banks
should also benefit from the robust condition
of the German economy. This is likely to con-
tinue to have a stabilising effect on risk provi-
sioning and interest business. How far net
interest received improves, given a continuing
flat yield curve and higher short-term interest
rates, remains to be seen, however. Against
this background, it can be said that, at least
in the case of the savings banks and the credit
cooperatives, an increase in the structurally
declining interest margin seems rather unlike-
ly in the financial year 2008. On the cost side,
declining administrative spending could have
a slight alleviating effect for the domestic
credit institutions as a whole. In particular,
variable and performance-related staff costs
are likely to decline in the current financial
year. However, this will probably not radically
alter the overall picture.

41Monetary growth
and its determinants
in recent yearsTo detect medium to long-term infla-
tionary risks early, the Eurosystem
undertakes a complex monetary analy-
sis which centres on M3, as the growth
of this monetary aggregate is particu-
larly closely linked to consumer price
inflation. Precise knowledge of the fac-
tors driving monetary dynamics is
therefore especially valuable for assess-
ing future price risks.
Monetary growth has many possible
causes. The components and counter-
parts of the money stock consequently
need to be analysed carefully in the
context of the consolidated balance
sheet of the banking sector. In the
euro area, a strong rise in loans to the
private sector has dominated for years.
This has also manifested itself in the
relatively high explanatory power of
housing price developments in the
money demand estimate for annual
M3 growth. In addition, vector autore-
gressive (VAR) analyses show that mon-
etary growth in the past two-and-a-
half years has also tended to have
been boosted by higher short-term
interest rates, since they have made
the M3 components that are remuner-
ated at close to market rates more at-
tractive. These expansionary effects of
interest rate policy on M3, however,
are quantitatively relatively small and
temporary. In the long run, interest
rate hikes dampen monetary growth.

42Monetary growth in the context
of the consolidated balance sheet
In the Eurosystem’s stability-oriented monet-
ary policy strategy, monetary analysis forms
the basis for assessing longer-term price
risks.1In this context, the Eurosystem has
been using a whole range of analytical meth-
odologies for quite some time now.2These
include inter alia monetary inflation forecasts
in which the average inflation rate over a
given period is predicted on the basis of mon-
etary variables. Such forecasts are noticeably
more accurate than forecasts which do not
include monetary variables, particularly over
time periods of more than two years.3
It is generally evident that indicator models
based on the growth of broad money, ie M3,
are particularly well suited to detecting future
longer-term inflationary risks early.4However,
short-term influences can temporarily distort
the information value of monetary data for
future price developments. These may include
not only purely statistical distortions such as
those caused by end-of-month, end-of-quar-
ter or end-of-year effects, but also somewhat
longer-lasting factors. Although the associ-
ated changes in the money stock may well
have economic causes, they need not neces-
sarily have any lasting price effects. Monetary
growth therefore must not be employed
mechanistically in the monetary policy
decision-making process. Rather, it is impera-
tive that the “underlying monetary dynam-
ics”, which are especially closely related to
longer-term inflation developments, be iden-
tified.In seeking to determine these underlying
monetary dynamics, monetary analysis, in a
first step, examines the various sources of
money creation. It is a good idea to base this
on the consolidated balance sheet of the
banking (or, to be precise, the MFI) sector.5
Such an analysis focuses particularly on loans
to domestic enterprises and individuals, de-
velopments which have traditionally made a
prominent contribution to monetary growth
in the euro area and are also generally closely
related to the private sector’s aggregate ex-
penditure. Focusing too much on this coun-
terpart, however, would be overly simplistic.
As a case in point, the Bundesbank dis-
covered back in the 1980s and early 1990s
that major shifts in international exchange
rates meant that the only way to assess the
underlying monetary dynamics in Germany
meaningfully was to look not only at private

5Monetary financial institutions (MFIs), the sector that
creates money in the euro area, include not only banks
but also money market funds. The consolidated balance
sheet of the MFI sector compares M3 and its components
with the MFIs’ other balance sheet items (especially loans
to domestic non-banks and foreign borrowers, securities
portfolios and MFIs’ longer-term liabilities), with pure
interbank assets and liabilities netted against one another
(“consolidated”). The consolidated balance sheet thus
represents MFIs’ business with domestic non-banks and
non-residents.Monetary

At the same time, it be-came more attractive for residents increasing-ly to borrow abroad to meet their financingrequirements rather than to take up loanswith domestic banks. During such periods,therefore, moderate domestic credit growthwas generally accompanied by large inflowsof funds from abroad and thus by a sharp risein German banks’ net external assets. The do-mestic banking sector’s total lending businesswas, during these periods, a much better in-dicator of trends in monetary growth thanlending alone – at least while domestic mon-etary capital formation showed no strikingchanges.

44bank debt securities) within an interest rate
cycle are quite normal; if the yield curve
steepens, the longer-term bank liabilities con-
tained in monetary capital become more at-
tractive, whereas if the yield curve is flat or
even inverted, investors prefer more liquid ve-
hicles for investing with banks. However, irre-
spective of the prevailing interest rate situ-
ation, unusual portfolio shifts in favour of
money stock components always present par-
ticular challenges when interpreting monet-
ary data. Experience has shown that this is
particularly common in times of high financial
market uncertainty, such as in the 2001-03
period, when a lengthy slide in stock prices
combined with geopolitical tensions had put
a visible damper on investors’ willingness to
invest in the longer term. As a result, not only
did monetary capital formation take place at
a slower pace during this period, but domes-
tic enterprises and individuals also sold large
volumes of securities to non-resident invest-
ors. The proceeds were invested in liquid M3
components at domestic banks. The effect of
these large inflows of funds from abroad on
the consolidated balance sheet of the bank-
ing system was a strong rise in the banking
system’s net external assets. The price risks
generated by money created in this fashion
are usually lower than, for instance, money
created by borrowing.
On the whole, the analysis of the consoli-
dated balance sheet reveals key information
on the sources of money creation which can
be used to assess inflationary risks. Price risks
usually vary depending on whether dynamic
monetary growth is caused by strong credit
expansion or extensive portfolio shifts as a re-sult of uncertainty. However, econometric
methods are needed in order to clearly iden-
tify the underlying economic causes of the
developments in the balance sheet counter-
parts to the money stock. Only then can the
contribution made by, for instance, interest
rates, income levels or geopolitical risks to
monetary growth be assessed. Generally,
money demand estimations are the basis on
which the monetary growth rate is decom-
posed into its macroeconomic determinants.
Analysing monetary growth using money
demand functions
Money demand functions usually cite trans-
actions motives and general portfolio consid-
erations as reasons why non-banks hold
money. In traditional specifications, nominal
gross domestic product (GDP , which meas-
ures the total volume of transactions in an
economy) and capital market rates or other
measures of the opportunity costs of holding
money are the decisive macroeconomic ex-
planatory factors. In addition, account is
taken of the fact that, in the short run, devi-
ations from the longer-term relationship may
occur; these are, however, remedied by
means of an adjustment process. Money de-
mand approaches simultaneously capture
these short-run dynamics and the long-run
relationship using an error correction ap-
proach.8

45Since 2001, such econometric analyses of
money demand in the euro area have increas-ingly been detecting signs that the hithertostable long-run relationships between money,income and interest rates no longer exist inthe same form as before. These standardmoney demand models are certainly unableto come up with a satisfactory explanationfor the continued strong growth of money inrecent years.
In relatively recent studies on money demand,
the weaknesses of the standard specificationof the demand for money in explaining cur-rent monetary trends have led to the inclusionof additional explanatory factors. For the2001-04 period, the traditional approacheshave been amended to include variableswhich are intended to reflect the degree ofmacroeconomic uncertainty and thus repre-sent the risk involved in investing in alterna-tive forms of finance such as fixed-interest se-curities or stocks.
9These approaches have
been very successful in capturing the pro-nounced portfolio shifts of households fromstocks into safe, liquid investment vehicles inthe aftermath of the global stock marketslump of 2001 and during the period of highgeopolitical uncertainty. However, they donot provide a satisfactory explanation for thestrong rise in the money stock since mid-2004.
In an alternative approach, holding money is
seen as part of a more complex portfolio deci-sion. This approach seeks to explain the hold-ing of money not through portfolio shiftscaused by uncertainty but rather as a yield-driven investment decision.
10To this end, ittakes into account not only GDP but also do-
mestic and foreign capital market and stockmarket yields. While this approach effectivelyexplains the strong rise in M3 in 2006 and2007, which was also reflected in high in-flows of funds from abroad in the consoli-dated balance sheet, for earlier periods it re-cords implausibly large residuals from thelong-run money demand.
However, these extensions fail to come to
grips with another key cause of the strongrise in the money stock over the past fouryears: they do not take sufficient account ofthe fact that, since mid-2004, borrowing inthe euro area has accelerated significantly,which was largely the result of boominghousing markets in many euro-area countries.Including housing variables in the demand formoney can help bridge the gap betweenmoney creation and money holding. A lastingrise in the holding of money is caused by thefact that money holding is influenced notonly by the substitution relationship betweenmoney and other forms of investment butalso the complementarity between monetarycomponents and other asset variables. In-creases in total wealth will typically inducethe private sector to hold a larger stock ofmoney.

46In standard money demand studies, GDP is
not only a transactions variable but also a
proxy for total wealth. However, there are
now many signs that GDP is not satisfactory
as an approximation of total wealth. This is
especially true of the post-2001 period, when
assets and incomes started to diverge notice-
ably owing to the boom in housing prices in
some euro-area countries and the highly vola-
tile stock markets. A recent study by Greiber
and Setzer (2007) cites, among other things,
trends in euro-area housing prices and hous-
ing wealth to explain the strong monetary
growth over the past few years.11Strong
growth in housing prices in the euro area will
probably have had a key impact on banks’
lending behaviour, since higher housing
prices improve real estate owners’ collateral
and thus give them easier access to loans. Ifthese effects are taken into account, a stable
long-run money demand relationship can be
established for both the euro area and the
United States. The reverse also appears to
hold, namely that an expansionary monetary
policy promotes the development of the
housing market by improving financing con-
ditions and thereby boosting demand for real
estate.
In principle, money demand studies can also
be used to gain an idea of the importance
specific explanatory factors have for monet-
ary developments. The table on this pageDecomposition of the annual growth rate of M3 into its determinants

47uses the money demand equation developed
by Greiber and Setzer (2007) to decomposethe annual M3 growth rate into its drivingfactors. According to this, the house price de-velopments of the past few years explain upto 3 percentage points of the annual M3growth rate. Despite a noticeable cooling inhousing price growth, they recently still con-tributed 1
1/C252percentage points to M3 growth.
In addition, price trends (as measured by theGDP deflator) made a significant contributionto monetary growth, namely 2
1/C252percentage
points in the second quarter of 2008, while,other things being equal, long-term interestrates dampened monetary growth.
When decomposing M3 growth, it also be-
comes evident, however, that current monet-ary developments cannot be fully explainedeven when housing prices are taken into con-sideration. From mid-2006 to the end of2007, the percentage of the monetarygrowth rate that can be explained by non-fundamental factors (“shocks”) has increasedcontinuously. Though the recent slight weak-ening of the monetary dynamics has resultedin this percentage falling back again some-what since the beginning of the year, theabove-mentioned fundamental factors cur-rently still explain less than 50% of total an-nual M3 growth. This can probably be attrib-uted in part to a strong increase in leveragedmergers and acquisitions, of which themacroeconomic factors observed for this an-alysis take no account, as well as the substan-tial yield-driven inflows of funds from abroadreferred to above.

48Note that the fact that high monetary growth
can be explained using a money demand
function does not necessarily mean that it is
not associated with inflationary risks. If, for
instance, an economy’s production capacity is
overstretched and/or interest rates are excep-
tionally low, this may explain strong monetary
growth, but it is still associated with high
price risks for the economy.
Econometric analysis of the relationship
between the Eurosystem’s interest rate
policy and monetary growth
Essentially, the strong monetary growth may
also have been encouraged by the ongoing
rise in short-term interest rates. Monetary
growth accelerated in line with the rate hikes
passed by the ECB Governing Council from
the end of 2005. These rate hikes resulted in
a flatter term structure and rendered short-
term investments more attractive compared
with longer-term exposures. Historically,
monetary dynamics during the current period
of rising interest rates displays the most paral-
lels with monetary growth during the period
of interest rate increases from June 1988 to
August 1992. Then as now, strong growth in
M3 went hand in hand with central bank rate
hikes. The fact that periods of rising interest
rates need not necessarily be accompanied by
higher monetary growth is evident from the
period from October 1999 to December
2000, when the interest rate rose and monet-
ary growth weakened.
Looking at the developments of the past
three years, the correlation observed betweenmoney market rates and trends in the money
stock could also reflect the fact that increas-
ing inflation risks as a result of strong monet-
ary growth prompted the monetary author-
ities to tighten monetary policy incrementally.
A comprehensive econometric analysis of the
effects of interest rate changes on the money
stock must not, a priori , dismiss any of these
possible correlations and causal relationships.
This is easier to achieve using a vector autore-
gressive (VAR) model than under simple re-
gression approaches and is one reason why
VAR models are now a standard instrument
in the empirical analysis of the dynamic ef-
fects of monetary policy shocks. One charac-
teristic of VAR models is that, as far as pos-
sible, all the explanatory variables used are
themselves explained by this approach. Look-
ing at the issue in hand, this means that both
the effects of interest rate changes on the
other variables and the determinants of the
rate move itself are captured simultaneously.
Another reason why VAR models are applied
widely is that they allow the dynamic
response of macroeconomic variables to a
one-off change in the decisive variables (the
so-called impulse) to be simulated and illus-
trated using what are known as impulse
response functions. An impulse or shock is
defined as the unexpected part of a monetary
policy measure (central bank rate change),
which economic agents have therefore not
taken into consideration in their plans.
The impulse response functions estimated
using the VAR model show that the money
stock (here measured by M3) initially rises in

49Specification of the VAR model
In keeping with the standard specification of
the money demand function, the model con-tains the following endogenous variables:nominal M3, real gross domestic product(GDP) as a measure of the real transactionvolume in the goods markets, the GDP defla-tor which proxies the general price level inthe economy as a whole, the nominal three-month money market rate as a control vari-able for the own rate of return on M3, thenominal interest rate on ten-year euro-areagovernment bonds as a measure of the op-portunity costs of holding money, and realhousehold housing wealth, which – amongother things – proxies the volume of trans-actions carried out by non-banks in assetmarkets.
1In addition, the VAR specification is
enlarged to include two exogenous variables:the nominal US three-month rate for Treasurybills, which represents external monetaryinfluences, and the commodity price index,which is an indicator of external inflationarypressure.
2All variables are modelled in levels.3
The analyses are based on quarterly data andare performed for the period from the fourthquarter of 1986 to the second quarter of2007.
4The shocks to the system are identified
by means of a Cholesky decomposition, whichimplies that shocks affect the economy in a
preordained chronological way. It may there-fore be assumed that the shocks to the GDPdeflator, real household housing wealth, theshort-term and long-term interest rate andnominal M3 do not affect real GDP contem-poraneously, but in a deferred manner. Bycontrast, M3 is allowed to respond to shocksto all other system variables instantaneously.
The impulse responses generated by our VAR
model are robust to different orderings of theendogenous variables: simulations of alterna-tive recursive structures of the economicshocks have no net overall impact on the pat-tern of the impulse responses. The estimates,moreover, show patterns of impulse responseswhich are plausible and largely consistentover time even if the sample length and thebeginning and endpoints are shifted. The ini-tially positive reaction of nominal M3 to acontractionary interest rate shock is strongerif the quarterly data for the first half of 2007are included; this is compatible with the ob-served pronounced comovement of interestrates and the acceleration of monetarygrowth during this phase.
1Household housing wealth is included on the basis of the
findings in C Greiber & R Setzer, Money and Housing – Evi-dence for the Euro Area and the US, Deutsche BundesbankDiscussion Paper Series 1, No 12/2007, who find a close rela-tionship between housing wealth/prices and monetary de-velopments over the past few years. — 2The inclusion of
commodity prices is based on ideas presented by C A Sims(1992), Interpreting the Macroeconomic Time Series Facts:The Effects of Monetary Policy, European EconomicReview 36 (5), pp 975-1000, and C A Sims & T Zha (1995),Does Monetary Policy Generate Recessions?, Yale Univer-sity. In these studies, the authors point out that commodityprices represent a key indicator of inflationary pressure, towhich the central bank reacts by raising interest rates. Ifcommodity prices were not included, the fact that com-modity prices are positively correlated with both the rateof inflation and the short-term interest rate would cause
the price level to react positively to the (fuzzily identified)monetary policy shock. This is known as the “pricepuzzle”. — 3For more on this topic, see the arguments
presented by C A Sims, J H Stock & M W Watson (1990),Inference in Linear Time Series Models with Some UnitRoots, Econometrica 58, pp 113-144. — 4The starting point
was set at 1986 in order, among other things, to pay dueregard to findings in the literature that some keymacroeconomic time series underwent a structural breakin the mid-1980s (see eg A McCallum & F Smets (2007), Realwages and monetary transmission in the euro area, KielWorking Papers No 1360, and F Altissimo, M Ehrmann &F Smets (2006), Inflation persistence and price-settingbehaviour in the euro area, ECB Occasional Paper SeriesNo 46).

50points in short-term interest rates, before
moving to the expected downward trend
from the fifth quarter onwards and, in the
long run, converging towards the zero line,
which describes the situation the variables
would be in had there been no shock.12This
initially positive response of the nominal
money stock to a rate hike can be explained
by temporary portfolio shifts. Higher short-
term interest rates at first render the short-
term investments contained in M3 more at-
tractive than longer-term exposures, leading
to a temporary increase in the money stock.
The medium-term decline in the money stock
then reflects, as generally expected, the fall in
demand for credit and the concomitant drop
in the creation of money.
Real GDP initially drops in response to an
interest rate shock, bottoms out after some
five quarters, but then converges towards
zero after approximately ten quarters, dem-
onstrating that the effect of monetary policy
on real growth is neutral in the long term.
Overall, the impulse response function of real
GDP displays a “J”-shaped curve, which is
consistent with the results of past analyses.
Interest rates’ response curve is also consist-
ent with expectations. The short-term interest
rate initially reflects its own positive shock
and falls continuously in the first six quarters.
It then stagnates below the zero line for some
time before gradually converging back to-
wards zero.
Following a contractionary interest rate
shock, the long-term rate initially rises, but
then drops after approximately two quartersbefore bottoming out in the fifth quarter and
moving back to the zero line in the long term.
The initial rise in the long-term interest rate
can be explained by the expectations hypoth-
esis regarding the term structure, which holds
that long-term interest rates essentially repre-
sent an average of expected future short-
term interest rates. The subsequent decline
can presumably be attributed to the dampen-
ing effect that the contractionary interest rate
shock has on the economy. A comparison of
the long-term and the short-term interest
rate movements shows that a central bank
rate hike also affects the term structure. Ini-
tially, the short-term interest rate rises more
than the long-term rate, which triggers the
portfolio restructuring mentioned above.
Real housing wealth declines in response to a
contractionary interest rate impulse, in an
overall “U”-shaped pattern. The impulse
response function of real housing wealth
therefore backs up both theoretical expect-
ations (higher short-term rates make refinan-
cing more expensive, tending to lead to lower
housing demand and lower housing prices)
and the results of other analyses.13

a contractionary interest rate shock and does
not start to fall until approximately the fifth

52quarter.14In the long term, monetary policy
displays the expected negative response to
the price level. M3 and the price level there-
fore display fairly similar reactions to a shock
to short-term interest rates.
The resulting impulse response functions
therefore largely confirm the theoretically de-
rived expectations about the qualitative ef-
fects of monetary policy. In terms of monet-
ary growth, which is of particular interest
here, the results suggest that the money
stock initially increases in response to a con-
tractionary interest rate shock (a one-off rate
hike) and only displays the anticipated down-
ward trend in the medium to long term.
However, this initial stimulating effect of
monetary policy on the money stock should
not be overestimated. At their peak, the
interest rate hikes carried out from December
2005 contributed less than 11/C254percentage
points to the monetary growth of recently
just under 91/C252%. Of late, the interest rate
rises of the past have already been dampen-
ing monetary growth slightly.
In the recent debate on the analysis of the
monetary transmission process, it has increas-
ingly been noted that both central banks and
financial market players have much more in-
formation at their disposal when making de-
cisions than is reflected in standard VAR
models. The scientific literature on this topic
points out that the omission of variables that
are relevant for central banks’ decision-
making process in the VAR approach may re-
sult in a distorted estimate of the non-
systematic component of monetary policy,
potentially calling into question the conclu-sions of the VAR model.15In addition, the lit-
erature notes that representing the under-
lying dynamics of some fundamental macro-
economic variables (eg inflation) using only
one indicator is insufficient if its meaningful-
ness is impaired by measurement errors or
other statistical problems.16In view of these
considerations, the robustness of the results
derived using the VAR model will, in the fol-
lowing, be verified against a broader analytic-
al framework, particularly in terms of the dy-
namic structure of monetary developments.
This is effected with the aid of a factor aug-
mented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) ap-
proach. The FAVAR model represents a modi-
fication of the VAR model in which selected
variables are replaced by so-called “factors”,
which are extracted from a large dataset
beforehand using factor analysis techniques.
The advantage of the FAVAR model over par-
simonious VAR model variants is that all po-
tentially relevant variables can be taken into
consideration at once. Therefore, the FAVAR
model largely avoids distorted estimates as a
result of neglected information (omitted vari-

53able bias).17The FAVAR model consequently
permits a large number of additional variables– including, for example, the componentsand counterparts of the money stock – to beincluded in the estimate and their response tomonetary measures to be analysed. Thisallows further insights into the reasons whythe money stock initially responds positivelyto a restrictive interest rate shock.
The estimates are based on a dataset com-
prising 65 macroeconomic time series for theeuro area and were carried out for the obser-vation period from the fourth quarter of 1986to the fourth quarter of 2006. The body ofdata was provided by the European CentralBank’s area-wide model database (AWMdata) and reflects a broad range of economicactivity in the euro area.
18Given the motiv-
ation for this study, we have added a fewmonetary variables (M1, M2, M3, M3 correct-ed, monetary capital, MFI loans and globalmoney).
19
The results are largely in line with expect-ations regarding the qualitative effects ofmonetary policy.
20They therefore confirm the
results of the VAR approach outlined above.Interestingly, there are no temporary positiveprice reactions using the FAVAR model. Thisoutcome consequently supports the objectionraised by several authors
21that using a single
indicator to represent inflation dynamics –this was the GDP deflator in the small VARmodel version used above – may be insuffi-cient.
22
As with the VAR model, nominal M3 initiallyrises (albeit with weak statistical significance)in response to a one-off positive impulse to
the short-term interest rate before showingthe expected falling pattern from roughly thefifth quarter and trending towards the zeroline in the long run. This confirms the resultof the VAR approach. Comparing the reactionof M3 with the impulse response function forthe M3 series corrected for portfolio restruc-turing in the years 2001 to 2003, it is evidentthat the initial upward response of nominalM3 is probably largely based on portfolio re-allocations. The greater attractiveness ofshort-term investments as a result of theinterest rate hike temporarily resulted in a no-ticeable increase in liquidity. The impulseresponse function for M1 provides more evi-dence for this idea: the liquid, non-interest-bearing (cash) or low-interest (overnight de-posits) monetary assets contained in M1 ini-tially react negatively to a one-off interestrate shock, thus raising the opportunity costsof holding cash, though the medium to long-term effect proves not to be significant.
17The quality of the estimate depends on how well the
extracted factors summarise the available information (ie
the data set).

19All time series (with the exception of interest rates)
were logarithmised and, where necessary, differentiated
to maintain the stationary pattern. As the time series’ dif-

were also standardised to mean zero and variance one.

54The FAVAR model of monetary policy transmission
The fundamental idea of the FAVAR approach rests in
merging the large amount of macroeconomic data
into a small number of variables (also known as fac-
tors) and then in using them for analytical purposes in
a VAR model.1With these ideas in mind, let it be as-
sumed in the following that the (Nx1) vector of macro-
economic time series Xtcan be represented as a linear
combination of the (Kx1) vector of unobserved
vectors Ft(Krelatively small, K< <N ) and an ob-
served factor Rt;which represents the interest rate
variable, such that
(1) Xt¼/C3fFtþ/C3rRtþet,
where /C3fis a (NxK) matrix of factor coefficients (factor
loadings). /C3ris the (Nx1) vector with the coefficients
of the observed factor Rt, and etis the (Nx1) vector of
error terms with mean zero and which are possibly seri-
ally and mutually weakly correlated. Equation (1) im-
plies that the dynamics of each individual time series in
the vector Xtare driven by the common factors ðFt;RtÞ
and an idiosyncratic component et, though etcan also
contain measurement error.
It is additionally assumed that the common factors
ðFt;RtÞshow the following dynamic process,
(2) /C8ðLÞh
Ft
Rti
¼vt;
where /C8ðLÞ¼I/C0/C81L/C0:::/C0/C8dLdis the matrix of the
lag polynomials of order d. The error term vtis mean
zero with covariance matrix /C10v. Equation (2) represents
the VAR model in ðFt;RtÞ.
The FAVAR model used here is estimated in a two-step
procedure. The first step is to identify the factors, the
second to estimate the VAR model. The relevant mon-
etary policy shock is identified using a Cholesky decom-
position under the assumption that the monetary pol-
icy shock has only a lagged impact on the unobserved
factors Ft.
In the first step of the analysis, Kcommon factors^CðFt;RtÞare estimated from all available time series
Xt.2For now, the fact that the short-term interest
rate Rt, in keeping with the assumption, represents an
observed factor shall be disregarded. Since each and
every linear combination which underlies the esti-
mated principal components^CðFt;RtÞnow also con-
tains the observed factor Rt, it is not possible to clearly
identify the policy shock recursively. Therefore, the
next step is to adjust the estimated factors^CðFt;RtÞfor
the influence of the observed factor Rt. To this end, adistinction is made between the variables that do not
react in the same quarter to the policy shock and the
variables that may react contemporaneously to a policy
shock; a vector^FS
tof the principal components is sub-
sequently extracted from the former category. Since
these factors, by definition, are not contemporaneous-
ly correlated with the observed factor Rt, the impact of
the observed factor Rtcan be calculated without bias
using the following multiple regression,
(3)^CðFt;RtÞ¼bS^FS
tþbRRtþ"t;
where bSis the coefficient matrix of the unobserved
factors, bRthe coefficient vector of the observed factor
and "ta vector of the random variables with mean
zero and covariance matrix /C10". The unobserved factors^Ftcan be calculated by subtracting the (quantitative)
effect of the observed factor Rtestimated in equation
(3) from^CðFt;RtÞ. The VAR model in^Ftand Rtcan
then be estimated consistently and the policy shock
can be clearly identified recursively with the selected
ordering of the factors ( Rtas the last element of the
monetary transmission chain).
In this study, the number of factors is determined on
the basis of a selective comparison of VAR model qual-
ity characteristics. In the preferred specification, eight
factors are extracted, accounting together for around
80% of the total variance in the data studied. The esti-
mate of the FAVAR model in equation (2), using the
identified factors, is then obtained as

55Conclusion
Overall, monetary growth is determined by
numerous factors whose importance may
vary over time. An analysis based on the MFI
sector’s consolidated balance sheet helps as-
certain whether the increase in the money
stock in terms of the balance sheet counter-
parts is the result more of a corresponding in-
crease in banks’ asset business or is associ-
ated with a particularly weak longer-term
propensity to invest with credit institutions
(monetary capital formation) on the part of
non-banks. Both sources of money creation
have been shaping monetary trends since the
introduction of the euro. From 2001 to 2003,
uncertainty resulted in extensive portfolio re-
structuring; since mid-2004, credit-driven
monetary growth has dominated. Distin-
guishing such causes has implications for
monetary policy. Whereas portfolio restruc-
turing as a result of uncertainty is likely to
have a lesser impact on consumer prices, a
largely credit-driven increase in the money
stock is greater cause for concern about sta-
bility.
What contribution macroeconomic funda-
mentals such as income and the interest rate
situation actually make to monetary growth
can only be established on the basis of empir-
ical research. Recent studies have shown, for
example, that housing variables have, in the
past few years, become important for ex-
plaining money demand. However, even this
approach can currently only account for
around 50% of monetary growth. Neverthe-
less, the long-term correlation appears to be%

56masked by temporary and constantly chan-
ging short-term influences.
Among other things, the VAR model shows
that the effects of interest rate changes on
monetary trends display alternating signs.
Interest rate increases initially promote mon-
etary growth, but exert a dampening influ-
ence in the longer term. One important ex-
planation for this dynamic monetary response
could be that broad monetary aggregates
temporarily benefit from a flatter (or even in-verted) term structure before the more re-
strictive monetary policy dampens bank lend-
ing in the longer term, in turn strengthening
monetary capital formation. The temporary
effect of an interest rate increase in upping
the money stock should therefore not be
overrated. For example, the rate hikes carried
out since December 2005 boosted monetary
growth by no more than 11/C254percentage
points at their peak. Recently, the interest
rate rises of the past have already been
dampening monetary growth slightly.

57Liquidity risk
management at credit
institutionsThe growth of the interbank market
and rapid expansion of the markets for
innovative financial instruments have
resulted in a sharp increase in the
market-based funding of credit institu-
tions. This trend has increased the
banking industry’s dependence on the
functioning and liquidity of these mar-
kets. This places greater demands on
banks’ internal liquidity risk manage-
ment systems, for instance in terms of
further developing their risk manage-
ment methods and processes using
liquidity risk stress tests. The forth-
coming publication of the Basel Com-
mittee on Banking Supervision’s re-
vised liquidity principles underscores
the heightened significance of liquid-
ity risk management, also from a regu-
latory perspective.
With the liberalisation clause of the Li-
quidity Regulation, German prudential
legislation already sanctions internal
liquidity measurement and manage-
ment processes for prudential report-
ing purposes. Together with the quali-
tative provisions of the Minimum
Requirements for Risk Management
(Mindestanforderungen an das Risiko-
management or MaRisk), it promotes
the further development of internal
liquidity risk management, taking into
account changes to refinancing condi-
tions.

58Concept and importance of liquidity and
liquidity risks
Over the last two decades, banks have in-
creasingly used the financial markets as a
means of financing long-term assets such as
loans. Both the interbank market, in which
banks provide each other with funds, and the
markets for innovative financial instruments
such as repurchase agreements, securitisation
and credit derivatives – which expanded rap-
idly until the US subprime crisis – have in-
creasingly complemented traditional sources
of finance such as savings deposits at larger
credit institutions. At the same time, the ef-
fective maturities of financing instruments
have shortened in relation to the deposit busi-
ness with its traditionally high share of core
deposits.
The above trend has increased the funding
liquidity risk. This term is used to describe the
risk of being unable to raise short-term funds
on an ongoing basis or only being able to do
so at elevated market prices. It therefore
comprises a cash flow and an earnings com-
ponent.
Importance of market liquidity
At the same time, the importance of market
liquidity as a further dimension of the liquidity
concept has grown. Market liquidity refers to
a feature of (financial) markets, which allows
assets (eg loans, securities etc) to be sold at
any time without affecting asset prices. It is
usually determined by four key factors. The
tightness of the market, which is measured
using the bid-ask spread, determines the costof unwinding a position at short notice. The
depth of the market assesses which transac-
tion volume can be realised immediately
without affecting prices. Resiliency describes
the speed at which market prices return to
equilibrium after a major transaction. The no-
tion of immediacy is defined as the time be-
tween the launch of a market transaction
and its final completion.
All four of the above factors provide informa-
tion on the direct and indirect costs of market
usage. These transaction costs are deter-
mined endogenously by the supply and de-
mand behaviour of market participants. If de-
mand meets supply, even for relatively large
trading volumes, transaction costs are low
and the market is considered liquid.
Information asymmetries and uncertainty are
particularly important for transaction costs
and thus market liquidity. In the presence of
asymmetric information, less well-informed
market participants tend to be more reserved
and, in extreme cases, stay away from the
market. Information asymmetries coupled
with uncertainty can therefore increase trans-
action costs and have negative effects on
market liquidity. Increasing market-based
funding of banks creates a correlation be-
tween funding liquidity and market liquidity
since a reduction in market liquidity can ad-
versely impact funding liquidity. Particularly
when transaction costs increase and market
liquidity falls in stress situations, the funding
of banks can become more expensive, requir-
ing changes to the funding structure. The re-
sulting changes in demand for funds can, in
turn, affect market liquidity.Greater use of

59Deutsche BundesbankReﬁ nancing sources for selected categories of banks
The absolute and relative importance of the 
various reﬁ  nancing sources for the individual 
banking groups has changed, in some cases signiﬁ  cantly, in recent years.
In the period under review, 1990 to 2008, depos-
its/loans from non-banks lost their role as the most important source of funding for the big 
banks, while the importance of bank deposits 
increased. Since 2001, both reﬁ  nancing sources 
have contributed roughly a third to the total 
reﬁ nancing volume. Over the same period, big 
banks also stepped up their use of the repo 
market, while there was no signiﬁ  cant change in 
the use of debt securities.
1
Looking at Landesbanken in the period under review, debt securities were replaced as the most 
important source of reﬁ  nancing by deposits/loans 
from banks, which ranked second, initially well ahead of non-bank deposits, as measured by bal-
ance-sheet total. More recently, the percentage 
of deposits/loans from banks was almost on a par with that of the big banks. The percentage 
of deposits/loans from non-banks in reﬁ  nancing 
is signiﬁ  cantly lower for Landesbanken than for 
the big banks because of their business model. 
Reﬁ nancing using repo transactions is of only 
secondary importance for them. 
Unlike the big banks and the Landesbanken, 
savings banks and credit cooperatives are still 
primarily funded by deposits/loans from non-
banks. By contrast, debt securities and/or repo 
transactions have only a secondary role to play, 
if any. 
Overall, market-based reﬁ  nancing sources are 
of much greater signiﬁ  cance to big banks and 
Landesbanken than to savings banks and credit 
cooperatives. The liquidity of the relevant mar-
kets and thus market liquidity risk is therefore 
likely to have a much greater impact on the 
reﬁ nancing activities of big banks and Landes-
banken than on those of savings banks and 
credit cooperatives.
1 The sharp increase in the percentage of debt securities in 
the big banks’ balance-sheet total in January 1999 can be attributed to an extension of the circle of big banks for 
which data are collated.As a percentage of the balance-sheet total, monthly

60Stress situations can lead to contagion effects
between market participants due to the cor-
relations described above. From a financial
stability perspective, it should be noted that
in a tense market environment, the individual
and collective rationality of market partici-
pants’ behaviour may diverge. For example, a
bank’s individual decision to exit the market
in a stress situation would negatively affect
market liquidity and, as a result, the remain-
ing market participants’ funding liquidity.
From a collective perspective, however, mar-
ket liquidity would increase if this bank re-
mained in the market, thus alleviating the ef-
fects of the stress situation for all market par-
ticipants.
Ensuring adequate liquidity for payment pur-
poses at all times is of the utmost importance
to banks. Even in the early days of the bank-
ing industry, liquidity-oriented rules such as
the “golden rule of banking” were de-
veloped. This rule stipulated that the size and
maturity of the long-term loans issued should
not exceed the size and maturity of the asso-
ciated long-term refinancing assets or de-
posits. Nowadays, banks use not only the
standardised approach of the Liquidity Regu-
lation1prescribed by the banking supervisors,
they also use own methods to measure and
manage liquidity such as cash-flow-based
gap analysis or, in some cases, stochastic
model approaches based on the value-at-risk
concept.
In gap analysis, cumulative contractual and
expected cash inflows and cash outflows are
compared to identify future liquidity surpluses
or deficits. To this end, the cash flows relevantto a bank’s liquidity position are first identi-
fied. Examples of relevant cash inflows in-
clude the receipt of due loan receivables, the
receipt of deposits and the sale of assets. Ex-
amples of relevant cash outflows include the
draw-down of standby credit extended to
other market participants, payment obliga-
tions from derivative transactions and the
withdrawal of deposits. When identifying
relevant cash flows, a distinction is made be-
tween contractually agreed, certain and un-
certain payments.
Based on a specific starting point, all of the
cash inflows and cash outflows which are
deemed relevant are assigned to maturity
bands. The granularity of maturity band
structures differs greatly among banks due to
their different business structures. Assign-
ment to a maturity band is based on contract-
ual maturity, provided there is one and it ap-
pears economically reasonable, for example,
when repaying time deposits received. If roll-
over assumptions are needed for the maturity
calculation, as in the case of savings or sight
deposits, the size and time of cash flows are
usually based on statistical assessments or ex-
pert opinions. There is a liquidity gap if ex-
pected cash outflows exceed expected cash
inflows in one or more of the maturity bands.
To cover liquidity gaps, the value of the liquid-
ity reserve, ie the amount of additional liquid-
ity available, which is defined individually by
each bank, is calculated for the relevant ma-

61Liquidity management lessons to be learned from the financial market turmoil of
2007-08
Banks that fund themselves largely through institu-
tional investors and the capital markets were par-ticularly hard hit by the financial market turbulenceof 2007-08. Mainly for these banks, the followingpreliminary liquidity risk management lessons canbe drawn from the market turmoil.
During the financial market turbulence, banks were
faced with a simultaneous disruption of importantfunding markets (in particular the unsecured inter-bank market, securitisation markets as well as cur-rency swap markets and the repo market), and,above all, they had difficulty accessing longer-termfunding. Even in the run-up to the crisis, severalbanks regarded the extent, gravity and duration ofthe market disruption as too unrealistic to includethe respective assumptions in their liquidity riskscenarios. These experiences should be reflected inthe assumptions on which future liquidity risk stresstests are based. The market disruption demon-strates that risk measurement systems should, as ageneral rule, be adaptive rather than static innature.
The endogeneity of liquidity risks proved a distin-
guishing feature of the turmoil. Banks mistrustedone another as they had virtually no informationon their business partners’ exposure to the sub-prime mortgage segment. At the same time, bankswere uncertain as to what cash outflows they them-selves would face in future. As a consequence, theyhoarded liquidity and were particularly adverse toproviding longer-term liquidity in the interbankmarket. The simultaneous increase in liquidity re-quirements in connection with securitisation trans-actions also resulted in second-round effects. Theseeffects in turn led to an increase in the correlationbetween the interbank and the credit markets andthus further exacerbated the situation. These obser-vations suggest that endogeneity should be betterreflected in future stress tests, for example by mod-elling other market players’ patterns of behaviour.
Because of information asymmetries in terms of
banks’ exposure to the subprime mortgage seg-ment, the reputation of an institution was of criticalimportance in the financial market turmoil of 2007-08. In this context, (timely) communication, mainlywith investors and rating agencies, proved crucial.At the same time, it became apparent that reputa-tional risks, which emerged during the recent tur-
moil for instance when accessing credit lines or mar-ginal lending facilities, should be included in liquid-ity risk management and in contingency plans. Fur-thermore, unexpected demand for market fundingwithout being an established market player mayalso expose banks to reputational risks.
In addition, during the financial market turmoil,
several banks had to meet, in some cases consider-able, off-balance-sheet obligations resulting fromtransactions in structured products. These included,for example, liquidity facilities which banks had ex-tended to conduits or other financing vehicles. Toavoid jeopardising their reputation, banks werewilling to provide liquidity even if they were notlegally obliged to do so. Since such facilities had, inthe past, been drawn on and/or voluntarily pro-vided in exceptional cases at best, a lot of bankshad not adequately reflected this in their liquidityrisk stress tests. However, the turmoil demonstratedthat off-balance-sheet obligations can prove mater-ial. It therefore appears appropriate to incorporatea liquidity risk charge in the pricing of structuredproducts in the future and to take greater accountof them in liquidity risk management.
In a crisis of international dimensions, difficulties
may also emerge in cross-border liquidity transfers(eg lower volumes in the currency swap markets,delays, higher costs). Liquidity risk stress testsshould therefore take into account such restrictions.At the same time, the observed spill-over effectsunderscored the importance of conducting liquidityrisk stress tests at group level.
Besides these lessons, which relate mainly to the
design of liquidity risk stress tests and contingencyplans, there are also lessons to be learned for liquid-ity management in general. At several banks, thedisruptions uncovered shortcomings for instance ininternal and external communication on liquidityrisk. In addition, a lack of coordination betweenoperative units, treasury, risk controlling and topmanagement hampered liquidity managementunder emergency conditions in some instances.Finally, the market turmoil underscored the import-ance of an adequate internal incentive system topromote the prudential use of the scarce resourcethat is liquidity.

62turity bands. The liquidity reserve usually
comprises short-term, liquid assets, the use of
standby credits received and collateralised re-
funding via the repo market. For securities on
the asset side, haircuts are normally applied
to the market price. In the case of collateral-
ised refinancing, for instance, the haircuts are
often based on the haircuts applied by the
European Central Bank.
Banks usually define, within their gap analy-
sis, limits for the balance or the ratio between
the liquidity reserve and liquidity gap for li-
quidity management purposes. Counter-
measures are initiated when the limit is ap-
proached or exceeded by a certain amount
depending on what has been agreed.
Stochastic model concepts
Besides gap analyses, the literature also sug-
gests stochastic model concepts such as li-
quidity at risk (LAR) or liquidity value at risk
(LVAR) for liquidity management.
LAR is the term used to describe the shortfall
in net cash flows which, with a given prob-
ability, will not be exceeded in the course of
one business day. The respective confidence
level is determined on the basis of the bank’s
risk tolerance and set individually by the
credit institution (eg 95% in the case of nor-
mal business operations). LAR is used to de-
termine the amount of liquidity credit institu-
tions should maintain to cover their daily pay-
ment obligations. In terms of underlying con-
cept, LAR is similar to value at risk for market
risks; however, it relates to the distribution of
autonomous net payment outflows2ratherthan loss distribution. Therefore, it bears no
relation to either the profit and loss account
or the management of equity. Crucially, risk
values outside the sample can also be esti-
mated via LAR using extreme value statistics.
These extreme values are factored into calcu-
lations since credit institutions usually make
conservative assumptions when calculating
the liquidity reserve for daily business to min-
imise the liquidity risk.
LVAR describes the value at risk caused by un-
expectedly high refinancing costs and which,
with a given probability, will not be exceeded.
Contrary to LAR, LVAR determines structural
liquidity risk and therefore refers to asset
level. As a result, the effect of liquidity risk on
profit and loss, and potentially also on capital
requirements, can be determined.
The vast majority of credit institutions that
use their own methods to measure and man-
age liquidity do so on the basis of gap analy-
ses or other comparatively simple procedures
in terms of underlying concept.3Stochastic
models are still used by only a few institu-
tions; however, the percentage of – in par-
ticular, larger – credit institutions which use
stochastic models has increased in the last
two to three years. There are also indications
that individual groups of banks are develop-
ing their own approaches to funding matrices
2Autonomous payments are defined as payments which
cannot be influenced by liquidity management.
3The simpler procedures include the analysis of balance
sheet stocks as of a specific cut-off date. However, this
fails to take into account future payment flows and their
uncertainty as well as off-balance-sheet obligations. The
stock approach is also very common. This calls for a min-
imum stock of liquid assets (mostly defined as a percent-
age of short-term liabilities) to be held at all times.Liquidity

Liquidity risk stress tests
Credit institutions measure and manage their
liquidity not only in normal business oper-ations, but also in case of potential liquiditycrises. Stress tests are an important liquidityrisk measurement and management tool fordetermining the effects of stress situationsquickly and preparing suitable countermeas-ures. As such, carrying out stress tests andhaving the ensuing contingency fundingplans in place as well as updating both stresstests and contingency funding plans to reflectthe latest developments are a central task ofrisk management.
To date, advanced stress tests for liquidity
risks are less widespread at credit institutionsthan stress tests for market and credit risks.Smaller institutions, in contrast, perform sim-pler scenario analyses which are often basedon balance sheet ratios.
Depending on the type of trigger event, stress
scenarios can be subdivided into external andinternal scenarios. External scenarios includemarket-related liquidity shocks such as thedrying-up of liquidity in individual markets; atypical internal scenario is the downgradingof an institution’s own rating. Credit institu-tions calculate an average of two to threestress tests for liquidity risks, mostly in theform of rating downgrades and market crisisscenarios. The scenario design varies amongbanks according to their business focus.Furthermore, a distinction is made between
historical and hypothetical scenarios depend-ing on whether the database for the analysesdraws on historical values, values derivedfrom a model or heuristic values. Unlike mar-ket and credit risks, for which the time seriestend to be longer, there is a limited amountof historical data available for measuring li-quidity risks. For example, prior to the latestbout of turbulence, liquidity facilities werenot simultaneously drawn upon to such alarge degree. If no meaningful data are avail-able, stress tests are performed primarily onthe basis of hypothetical scenarios.
Stress tests are carried out on the basis of
sensitivity or scenario analyses. While sensitiv-ity analyses test the dependence on a select-ed risk factor, scenario analyses simultaneous-ly examine the effects of several risk factorson liquidity. The analyses take into accountassumptions regarding the duration of theshock and the time required for suitablecountermeasures. Once the scenario is de-veloped, institutions check whether there isenough liquidity potential to cover any liquid-ity gaps. The parameters used in the individ-ual assumptions, eg for the availability of un-secured refinancing funds in a stress situation,are primarily based on experience or on ex-pert estimates.
In liquidity risk stress tests, institutions primar-
ily focus on the cash flow level, while the ef-fects on returns, eg higher refinancing costs,are largely not accounted for. Following therecent developments on the financial mar-

64Deutsche Bundesbank’s quantitative survey of liquidity risk stress tests
In addition to stress test analyses based on
the prudential reporting data provided
under the Liquidity Regulation (Liquidit/C228ts-
verordnung) , the Bundesbank also collects
data from selected banks on the impact of
various liquidity risk scenarios. The partici-
pating banks use their internal liquidity risk
measurement and management processes
to calculate the impact of negative events
on their liquidity position. The results in-
clude the qualitative documentation of the
scenarios used and assumptions made.
This year’s survey reveals that the partici-
pating institutions employ very similar
methods for their liquidity risk stress tests.
Gap analyses are used to compare the out-
flows of funds in a stress event with the
inflows of funds that can be generated
in such an event or the liquidity buffer.
Thematically, the stress tests also reflect
similar events such as a rating downgrade
or market crises. However, there are large
differences in the concrete scenario de-
scription, the assumptions made, the ratios
calculated and the internal reporting of
the stress test results. In case of a rating
downgrade, the stress tests differ, for one,
in terms of the assumed severity of the
downgrade (from one notch to three not-
ches); for another, different assumptions
are made in terms of the impact the stress
event will have on funding.
Market crisis scenarios and rating down-
grades were modelled as stress scenarios
most frequently; there is a fine line be-
tween an institution-specific (idiosyncratic)
and a market-related scenario, ie marketcrisis scenarios generally also include idio-
syncratic elements. A number of institu-
tions regard a decline in securities prices as
a market crisis scenario (focus on the asset
side), while others primarily look at restric-
tions in access to essential funding sources
(focus on the liability side).
Combined scenarios, which simulate strong
effects on both the asset and the liability
side – for example a financial market crisis
combined with a rating downgrade – have
been studied less frequently to date; refine-
ments are currently underway here.
As the financial market turmoil has been
ongoing for nearly a year now, institutions
are increasingly looking at a longer time
horizon in their stress tests. Currently, most
institutions observe a time horizon of six
months to a year in stress testing.
The survey shows that there is a high
degree of heterogeneity in terms of the
design of different banks’ liquidity risk
stress tests. One reason is that the banks
under observation act very differently
depending on their business focus and
therefore make different assumptions in
terms of cash inflows and outflows in a
stress event. Differences in scenarios and
assumptions as a result of different business
models are therefore justified. This diver-
sity limits the comparability of the various
banks’ stress test results, but does have
the advantage of reducing the danger of
stability-jeopardising herding behaviour by
banks.

65kets, however, some institutions intend to in-
corporate these aspects, too. Other institu-tions deliberately focus their stress tests oncash flows alone because they consider theprimary goal of liquidity risk stress tests to bethe safeguarding of short-term operating li-quidity and not the analysis of medium-termor long-term effects.
Banks incorporate the results of the stress
tests in their daily liquidity risk management,eg in the limits they set, in different ways. If astress test exceeds the predetermined limits,stark automatism with regard to the counter-measures to be taken is usually avoided infavour of reacting flexibly and quickly de-pending on the situation. Potential responsesin the event of an emergency and their or-ganisational framework are provided for incontingency funding plans, among otherthings.
Contingency funding plansIn recent years, almost all banks have de-
veloped a contingency funding plan which,according to the recommendations of theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision,should present a “strategy for handling li-quidity crises and include procedures for mak-ing up cash flow shortfalls in emergency situ-ations”.
5Such contingency funding plans
normally apply to an entire banking group,but individual institutions within a bankinggroup can also have their own contingencyfunding plans.
There are significant differences between
banks’ contingency funding plans with regardto the level of detail and stringency of provi-
sions. This is a result of the different prefer-ences concerning the degree of flexibilitydecision-makers should have in an emer-gency situation. In some banks, contingencyfunding plans have a prescriptive character,while in others, they simply present a numberof potential measures. In the event of anemergency, they normally define responsibil-ities and a decision-making committee whichis then responsible for liquidity management.This committee generally consists of mem-bers of the treasury and trading departments,although the management of the bank is al-ways involved either directly or indirectly.Contingency funding plans often defineevents which trigger the setting in motion ofthe contingency funding plan, such aschanges in customer behaviour (eg with-drawal of sight deposits), in the money mar-ket (eg changes in short-term interest rates)or in the financial markets (eg changes inspreads for medium-term refinancing instru-ments). Other banks intentionally do not in-clude an explicit definition of incendiaryevents and decide whether to activate theplan on a case-by-case basis.
Often contingency funding plans divide an
emergency into several escalation levels, eg inthe form of a traffic light system: “green” isnormal, “yellow” deteriorating business andrefinancing conditions and “red” a threaten-ing limitation of the liquidity situation. Thenumber of levels varies from institution to in-stitution, as do the criteria which determine

66the transition to the next level. Such criteria
can include, for instance, poor stress test re-
sults or an increase in refunding costs. Nor-
mally, specific liquidity management meas-
ures, different responsibilities and different
communication strategies are defined for the
various escalation levels.
Liquidity management measures at the vari-
ous escalation levels can serve to generate
liquidity, eg from the sale of liquid and less
liquid assets, additional open market transac-
tions with central banks, the issue of debt
securities, securitisations or the utilisation of
standby credits received from other credit
institutions. Also, liquidity-saving measures
such as no longer purchasing illiquid assets or
placing restrictions on the issue of new loans
are possible. Earnings and reputation are
often the decisive factors when it comes to
deciding the order in which the various re-
funding options are realised. The contingency
funding plan often ensures that, in the event
of an emergency, the legal and operational
prerequisites necessary for initiating the re-
spective measures are met. Some contin-
gency funding plans address internal and ex-
ternal communication, eg with banks’ man-
agement, supervisory bodies, supervisory au-
thorities, investors and rating agencies. In
addition to allocating responsibility for com-
munications, they also contain information
on the timing and contents of communica-
tions and what form they should take.
Regular tests can be conducted to ensure
that a contingency funding plan functions as
smoothly as possible in the event of an emer-
gency. These tests often relate to operationalaspects such as the ad-hoc convening of an
emergency committee, checking the tele-
phone numbers of the individuals deemed re-
sponsible or checking whether the necessary
legal and operational preparations have been
made.
If banks initiated their contingency funding
plans during the financial market turbulence
of 2007/2008, they did so mostly at a rela-
tively low escalation level. In such cases, the
contingency funding plans proved useful
since valuable time was saved as a result of
potential measures and responsibilities having
been defined in advance.
National regulation and international
discussion of liquidity risks
Provisions of the Liquidity Regulation
(Liquidit/C228tsverordnung)
The Liquidity Regulation, which entered into
force on 1 January 2007, sets forth the na-
tional prudential reporting regulations for
banks. The standardised approach of the Li-
quidity Regulation is, in essence, a continu-
ation of the regulations of the previously ap-
plicable Principle II, while the liberalisation
clause allows for the use of internal proced-
ures.
Using the standardised approach, institutions
report their expected payment inflows and
outflows from specific balance-sheet and off-
balance-sheet asset and liability positions ac-
cording to their residual maturity or call prob-
ability, as determined by the supervisors, inEarnings and

67four maturity bands. They also recognise list-
ed securities and covered debt securities aswell as assets eligible as central bank collat-eral as highly liquid assets in the shortest ma-turity band and thus as funds (irrespective ofthe residual maturities). Highly liquid assetstherefore act as a buffer for settling paymentobligations at any time. The result is liquiditysurpluses or deficits for all four maturitybands.
An institution’s liquidity is deemed sufficient
when the funds available for the comingmonth (first maturity band) – calculated fromthe relevant reporting date – at least coverthe payment obligations for that period. Theregulatory liquidity ratio is the ratio of fundsto payment obligations and must amount toat least one.
The prudential reporting regulations of the
Liquidity Regulation give supervisors regularinsight into banks’ liquidity situation. Usingthe standardised approach, however,institution-specific factors are not taken intoaccount. It is therefore a pragmatic com-promise in which certain conceptual deficitsare accepted in return for methodical simpli-city and comparability. With the increasingsize of business, higher complexity of transac-tions and increasing volatility of paymentflows, the standardised approach becomesless meaningful for calculating an institution’sactual liquidity risk.

the Liquidity Regulation), banks can, for thepurpose of prudential reporting, use liquidityrisk figures which have already been calcu-Requirements of liquidity models (sec-

68lated in their internal liquidity risk manage-
ment procedures. The liberalisation clause
allows banks, under certain circumstances, to
use their own liquidity models6instead of the
standardised approach. If the eligibility cri-
teria of section 10 of the Liquidity Regulation
are met, the institution receives written con-
firmation of the suitability of its internal li-
quidity model within the meaning of the Li-
quidity Regulation from the BaFin on the
basis of an examination carried out by the
Deutsche Bundesbank in accordance with
section 44 (1) sentence 2 of the German
Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ).
The model alternative of section 10 of the
Liquidity Regulation is an option which does
not contain any method-related provisions.
The requirements of the Liquidity Regulation
are formulated in an open way to allow
for flexibility with regard to banks’ internal
model design. Institutions are therefore given
the opportunity to create consistency be-
tween internal bank risk management and
prudential reporting requirements and, in
doing so, avoid double calculations and re-
duce overall administrative outlay. Another
advantage for institutions is the possibility of
having a liquidity risk measurement and man-
agement process approved at institutional or
financial holding group level. The liberalisa-
tion clause allows supervisors, in turn, to ana-
lyse internal liquidity risk management pro-
cesses and the liquidity situation of an institu-
tion in greater detail.
To meet the challenges for both institutions
and banking supervisors resulting from the
high degree of flexibility, an exhaustive ex-change of ideas and information was held
when the Liquidity Regulation came into
effect, both among banking supervisors as
well as with institutions and associations. An
examination concept and examination guide-
lines were developed internally by a working
group of supervisors (Bundesbank and BaFin).
Furthermore, various documents were pub-
lished to foster the process of approving in-
ternal liquidity risk models.7
Liquidity risk in the MaRisk
Irrespective of whether an institution opts for
the intentionally simple standardised ap-
proach or for the liberalisation clause, which
takes individual conditions into account to a
greater extent, it must fulfil the quality-
oriented Minimum Requirements for Risk
Management (MaRisk). These provide con-
crete detail on section 25a of the German
Banking Act and should, as principle-based
requirements, also be applied according to
the principle of proportionality.
The MaRisk classify liquidity risk as one of the
types of risk which is usually significant for an
institution. Liquidity risks are basically subject
to the general requirements for organisation-
6A liquidity model in this context does not necessarily
imply a stochastic model. In addition to risk measure-
ment, the emphasis lies on risk management and inte-
grating the model into company-wide risk management.
The Liquidity Regulation uses the term “internal liquidity
risk measurement and management procedures”.

corporated in an appropriate manner in thebank’s internal risk management and control-ling processes. Liquidity risks must also be in-cluded in management’s risk strategy, butneed not necessarily be taken into account inthe risk-bearing capacity analysis. Institutionsmust justify their non-incorporation and arenot exempt from complying with the otherMaRisk requirements.
As well as these general risk management
provisions, the MaRisk also contain special li-quidity risk management requirements: therequirement that liquidity for payment pur-poses must be ensured at all times incorpor-ates the legal provision of section 11 of theGerman Banking Act, according to which in-stitutions must invest their funds in such away as to ensure that “sufficient liquidityfor payment purposes is guaranteed at alltimes”. The asset and capital structure mustbe diversified to avoid unilateral dependen-cies, for example, on certain refinancingchannels. To be able to cover liquidity needs,institutions must pay particular attention toasset liquidity. This requires that institutionsdeal with the characteristics of the productsand markets relevant to them.
As part of their liquidity risk management
processes, institutions must prepare a liquidityoverview which shows both the current li-quidity situation and expectations for thefuture. The regular scenario analyses are par-ticularly important for liquidity risk manage-ment. To be able to assess the liquidity situ-ation, even when conditions deteriorate, in-stitutions must take it upon themselves to de-velop appropriate scenarios. Potential liquid-
ity squeezes can be identified in this way andtaken into consideration in the risk manage-ment process.
An institution-specific and scenario-specific
catalogue of measures which contains liquid-ity sources in the event of a liquidity squeezeand takes into account any shortfall in pay-ment inflows must also be compiled. Theorganisational units or persons responsiblefor initiating and carrying out liquidity-generating measures as well as the design ofcommunication channels and authority toissue instructions must be defined. Finally, theMaRisk require that management receiveregular reports on the liquidity situation.
International regulationAt international level, there are major differ-
ences between supervisory systems for moni-toring liquidity risk; purely qualitative andprinciples-oriented prudential requirementsexist alongside predominantly quantitativesupervisory regimes based, for example, on li-quidity ratios.

70have addressed, amongst others, the ques-
tion of how the relative lack of international
harmonisation impacts the efficiency of both
regulation and banks’ internal liquidity risk
management processes, particularly at cross-
border institutions.
Against this backdrop and owing to the re-
cent financial market turbulence, the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision has re-
solved to develop new international principles
for the management and prudential treat-
ment of liquidity risks in the banking sector.
This intention is supported explicitly in the
recommendations of the Financial Stability
Forum (FSF).10
In June 2008, the Basel Committee published
and released for consultation a corresponding
draft entitled “Principles for Sound Liquidity
Risk Management and Supervision”. The new
framework aims to modernise and expand
the “Sound Practices for Managing Liquidity
in Banking Organisations” from 2000 and
takes into account the Basel Committee’s rec-
ommendation of a more principles-oriented
approach to banking supervision regulations.
The final version should be available by the
end of September this year.
The following amendments to the status quo
are particularly relevant for the banking in-
dustry and supervisory bodies.
– Systematic listing of all potential sources
of liquidity risk (including off-balance-
sheet transactions) and risk limitation
techniques (eg limit systems, early warn-
ing indicators)– Definition of risk tolerance by manage-
ment, taking into consideration business
policy and the relevance of the institution
in the financial system
– Demand for an appropriate liquidity cush-
ion, for example in the form of high-
quality liquid assets
– Greater gearing of liquidity management
and regulation to stress and emergency
situations, eg through stress tests with
suitably conservative stress scenarios
– Consideration of liquidity costs and risks
in the overall bank management process
– Addressing the intraday liquidity risk when
participating directly and indirectly in pay-
ment and settlement systems (intraday li-
quidity management)
– Emphasis on adequate collateral manage-
ment to determine the amount of collat-
eral effectively available
– Organisational requirements for liquidity
management in banking groups to ensure
the group-wide availability of liquid funds
or refinancing sources
– Recommendations on regular disclosure
with a view to informing market partici-
pants of banks’ liquidity management
more effectively

71– Clear expansion of the role of banking
supervisors, with greater emphasis nowplaced on prudential information extrac-tion, intervention in the event of non-compliance with principles and cross-border as well as inter-institutional co-operation
Since the Basel Committee and the FSF ex-
pect the new liquidity principles to be imple-mented carefully and monitored regularly, theEuropean Commission has already proposeda corresponding amendment to the provi-sions of Annex V of the Banking Directive.
To coincide with the new liquidity principles
of the Basel Committee, in compliance with aconsultation assignment from the EuropeanCommission, the Committee of EuropeanBanking Supervisors (CEBS) published a con-sultation paper at European level containingrecommendations for liquidity risk manage-ment and supervision at financial institu-tions.
11The content of the CEBS recommen-
dations is based largely on the principles ofthe Basel framework. The CEBS places moreemphasis than the Basel Committee on thefact that these recommendations also applyto smaller banks and investment companiesin accordance with the guiding principle ofproportional applicability. The CEBS recom-
mendations differ fundamentally from theBasel principles in that they explicitly take intoaccount the possibility of prudential recogni-tion of an institution’s internal liquidity riskmeasurement and management processesand thus go beyond the proposals of theBasel Committee. Ultimately, this approachmeans that important elements of the Ger-man liquidity provisions have been incorpor-ated in the CEBS recommendations for insti-tutions.
All in all, banking supervision in Germany,
with its updated liquidity regulations whichapply to both small and medium-sized banksand cross-border institutions, is well pos-itioned in the European and international dis-cussion. In addition to existing individual bi-lateral agreements, international and Euro-pean supervisory bodies are also aiming to in-tensify cross-border cooperation in the areaof liquidity supervision. The work of the BaselCommittee and the CEBS is therefore expect-ed to continue, with a view to making moreprogress on the convergence of liquidity re-gimes.
