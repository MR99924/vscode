5CommentariesEconomic conditions
IndustryAccording to the latest data, industry is still
on an upward trend. Following weaker fig-ures in June, both new orders and outputshowed a further clear seasonally adjustedrise in July, although the increase is overstatedsince July was relatively little affected by thesummer holidays. As in 2003, the holidayswere concentrated very heavily on August. Interms of demand, export orders, in particular,showed a marked increase, while domesticorders remained subdued. Producers of dur-able consumer goods recorded the largestrise in output. By contrast, there was no morethan a slight increase in output in the inter-mediate goods sector. Overall, orders in Julywere 7
1/C252% up on the year. The year-on-year
figure for output was +31/C252%.
ConstructionThe situation in the construction sector was
still unfavourable around the middle of 2004.Orders in June showed a slight seasonally ad-justed rise on the downturn in May, a monthin which, mainly in industrial construction,only a low level of new orders had beenplaced. The overall level of ordering, however,was still obviously lower than it had been inthe first few months of 2004 and was 6
1/C252%
down on the year. Seasonally adjusted con-struction output in July was largely at thesame low level as in the preceding months.Orders and

6Labour market
No improvement on the labour market was
evident up to the end of the period under re-view. According to the initial estimate by theFederal Statistical Office, the number of per-sons in work in June, at a seasonally adjusted38,204 million, was virtually at the same levelas it had been in May. The year-on-year fall,which had gone down to around 100,000 inthe months before, widened to more than120,000. Following the development in un-employment, which also showed very littlechange in June, a further decline in employ-ment is in prospect for the coming months. Itis possible that (as was the case last year) thestable employment situation in June was re-lated to the fact that the summer holidayperiod was concentrated on the month ofAugust. Experience has shown that there isan increase in redundancies before the startof the holiday period.
The seasonally adjusted number of persons
officially registered as unemployed showed afurther rise in August to 4,414 million. Thiswas around 35,000 more than at the end ofJune. The year-on-year increase was just over30,000, or 110,000 if persons participating inaptitude tests and training measures (whohave been excluded from the unemploymentstatistics since the start of this year) are alsotaken out of the August 2003 figure. In themiddle of the year, the gap had been notice-ably smaller. The seasonally adjusted un-employment rate, as calculated by the FederalLabour Office, went up to 10.6%. Using thestandardised European definition, the figurewas 9.9%.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Prices
The rate of consumer price increase gathered
pace in August with a seasonally adjusted0.3% increase on the month. The year-on-year rate of increase went up to 2.0%, com-pared with 1.8% in July. This was due mainlyto higher prices for petrol and heating oil,which tracked movements in world marketprices. Food did become cheaper in Augustbut the price reductions were not as large asthey usually are at this time of year. Pricechanges remained very small in the case of in-dustrial goods, however. The year-on-yearrate of 1.8% does indicate a price rise butthat is due to the after-effects of the tobaccotax increase which came into effect on1 March 2004 and the fact that pharmaceut-icals have become more expensive under thehealth system reform. Excluding administra-tive effects on consumer prices and leavingaside energies prices (determined to a largeextent by the world market) as well as sea-sonal food products, the prices of which areespecially volatile, the year-on-year rate ofprice increase was largely unchanged inAugust at
1/C252%.
German industrial producer prices showed a
sharp seasonally adjusted rise in August andthe year-on-year increase went up to 2.2%.The pace of increase was only slightly slowerif energy sources, which became significantlymore expensive, are excluded. The price risewas especially sharp in the case of intermedi-ate goods, reflecting the surge in the price ofsteel that stemmed from the world markets.Overall, import prices in July (more recentdata are not yet available) were 2.2% up onthe year. Here, too, energy as well as steel
and steel products were the main driving fac-tors.
Public finances
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
In July the indebtedness of central, state and
local government rose sharply by 320.5 bil-
lion. Cumulative net borrowing in the firstseven months of 2004 amounted to 374.9
billion (compared with 362.5 billion in the
same period last year). The sharp growth indebt in July was due mainly to central govern-ment, which increased its indebtedness by317.3 billion net. This development was,Net borrowing in the market

8however, partially offset by a significant in-
crease of 37.1 billion in its money market de-
posits. Central government raised 312.8 bil-
lion on the capital market. This was primarilythe result of the sale of Federal bonds(Bunds). The topping-up of the latest ten and30-year Bunds yielded 36.7 billion and 34.5
billion respectively. After deducting the re-demption of a ten-year Bund to the volumeof35.1 billion, net sales including market
management operations amounted to 37.9
billion. With issue yields of 4.25% and4.89%, the financing terms were consider-ably more favourable than in the case of thematuring bond, which had to be serviced at6.75%. The volume of Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) outstanding also rose sharply(+35.4 billion). The topping-up of a June
issue accounted for 35.1 billion of thisamount and market management operations
for30.3 billion. Debt securities of the Cur-
rency Conversion Equalisation Fund amount-ing to 31.1 billion were redeemed on sched-
ule. On the money market central govern-ment raised 34.5 billion.
In the case of those special funds not inte-
grated into central government debt, cashadvances to the German Unity Fund rose by30.2 billion. State government expanded its
indebtedness in July by 32.6 billion net. It pro-
cured 33.7 billion through cash advances. By
contrast, the amount of Treasury notes in cir-culation fell by 31.4 billion. The indebtedness
of local government appears to have risenagain marginally in July.
Central government borrowingIn August central government drew 322.4 bil-
lion gross on the capital market, 311.3 billion
of which was required to refinance maturingsecurities. It reduced the volume of its out-standing money market loans by 36.9 billion.
Thus, on balance, net borrowing by centralgovernment amounted to 34.2 billion. Bor-
rowing was again accompanied by an in-crease in money market deposits (+ 32.3 bil-
lion). The most significant individual item ofgross borrowing was the new issue of a five-year Federal note (Bobl), whose coupon, at3.5%, was increased by
1/C254percentage point
compared with that of the previous series.36.9 billion was allotted by tender, with the
issue yield being slightly down at 3.41%. 35
billion worth of Bobls carrying a slightly high-er coupon of 4.125% were redeemed onschedule. Including market management op-Borrowing in the market by central

9The current debate on the Stability and Growth Pact
In view of its stability policy mandate,
the Bundesbank has been followingthe current debate about reformingthe fiscal rules in the Community withconcern. It carefully analysed the Euro-pean Commission’s proposals of 3 Sep-tember and in a press release issued on7 September, which is reproduced be-low, the Bank expressed its oppositionto any substantive weakening of thePact and the prescribed procedures.
Do not weaken the Stability and
Growth Pact
On 3 September 2004 the European
Commission explained its proposals fora reform of the Stability and GrowthPact. The Bundesbank believes that, in-stead of strengthening the Stabilityand Growth Pact, the proposed chan-ges would have a generally detrimentaleffect on it. Consequently, this wouldharm the framework for euro-areamonetary policy. The incentive to main-tain a sound budgetary policy in themember states of the monetary unionwould be undermined and a false sig-nal would be sent out to those coun-tries which have not yet introduced thesingle currency.
The objective of the Stability and
Growth Pact is to attain and maintainsound public finances in the euro area.In no way is the aim of the pact an ex-cessive impingement on the flexibilityof member states’ fiscal policy. A bud-get which is at least close to balance inthe medium term will generally enablethe automatic stabilisers to take effect.Sound public finances promote growth
and employment and help to meet thedemographic challenges which will im-pose a considerable burden on thesocial security systems. Healthy publicfinances are absolutely essential if theEuropean System of Central Banks is tobe able to guarantee long-term pricestability at relatively low interest rates.The fiscal policy rules to be applied inEurope were a major precondition forthe introduction of the euro during thepublic debate in Germany.
The problem with the Stability and
Growth Pact lies not in its terms but inits implementation. It is true that theaim of some of the Commission’s pro-posals is to apply the pact more con-sistently within the existing legalframework, but the Bundesbank warnsagainst changing the rules laid downfor fiscal policy. Many of the proposalswhich the Commission is now puttingforward for discussion would make thelegal framework more complicatedand less transparent, thereby renderingit less enforceable. Some of the propo-sals are tantamount to a reduction inthe commitment to rules and an in-crease in the degree of discretion. TheBundesbank considers such a change ofdirection wrong. We are convincedthat particularly the overshooting ofthe 3% deficit limit should continue tobe allowed only in the exceptionalcases specified in the Stability andGrowth Pact. The period for correctingexcessive deficits should not be ex-tended.

10erations, the outstanding amount of these se-
curities rose by 32.5 billion. The additional
topping-up of the ten-year Bund issued inMay raised a further 36.6 billion. At 4.05%,
the average yield was 20 basis points downon that of the July issue. Taking into accountmarket management operations, the out-standing amount of Bunds rose by 38.1 bil-
lion. The sale of Bubills raised 35.6 billion
gross. Compared with the previous month,the average issue yield fell slightly to 2.04%.On balance, however, Bubills were redeemedin the amount of 30.4 billion. The volume of
Sch/C228tze in circulation rose by 30.7 billion as a
result of market management operations.
Securities markets
Bond marketSales activity in the German bond market was
buoyant in July. At 3112.1 billion, the market
value of debt securities issued by domesticborrowers was considerably higher than inJune ( 397.9 billion). After deducting redemp-
tions and changes in issuers’ holdings of theirown bonds, net sales went up from 34.8 bil-
lion to 320.0 billion. Sales in Germany of for-
eign bonds and notes raised 312.5 billion net.
Total sales receipts in the German bond mar-ket amounted to 332.5 billion.
In July enterprises raised 310.6 billion (net) in
the domestic capital market from sales oflonger-term corporate bonds. The volume ofcommercial paper outstanding fell by 31.9
billion, with domestic non-financial enter-prises raising 38.7 billion overall in the bondmarket. However, these figures include paper
arising from the securitisation of the debtowed to the Federal Government by Russiaand the proceeds were therefore not directlyattributable to the corporate sector.
Credit institutions borrowed 36.9 billion in
the bond market, the volume of bank debtsecurities outstanding having declined by30.7 billion in the previous month. By far the
bulk of the funds raised ( 310.6 billion) were
attributable to sales of other bank debt secur-ities. Sales of paper issued by special purposecredit institutions raised 33.7 billion and sales
of mortgage Pfandbriefe raised 30.9 billion.
The volume of public Pfandbriefe outstandingdecreased by 38.4 billion, ie by a similar
amount as in the previous month.
The public sector expanded its bond market
liabilities by 34.4 billion compared with June.
The Federal Government was the main con-tributor to this figure, raising 36.9 billion
worth of resources. In the long-term maturitysegment, it issued 35.0 billion more of
30-year Federal bonds and 32.9 billion more
of 10-year Federal bonds. In the short-termsegment two-year Treasury notes were mostin demand, raising 35.9 billion; in the previ-
ous month 33.2 billion worth had been re-
deemed. The amount outstanding of Federalsavings notes decreased by 30.2 billion and
that of Treasury discount paper by 30.3 bil-
lion.

duced their bonded debt by 31.3 billion in
the month under review.
Foreign investors purchased 313 billion worth
of bonds in July, having sold 312.1 billion
worth of paper in June. German credit institu-tions invested 35.6 billion in domestic bonds
and 36.2 billion in foreign debt securities.
Non-banks showed far less interest in debtsecurities, investing 37.8 billion as opposed to
321.2 billion in the previous month. They re-
duced their holdings of public sector paper by39.8 billion, adding instead 311.3 billion
worth of domestic private bonds and 36.4 bil-
lion worth of foreign bonds to their port-folios.
Equity marketDomestic enterprises issued far fewer shares
in July ( 30.2 billion) than in the previous
month ( 31.3 billion). Foreign equities record-
ed outflows of 32.1 billion. Foreign investors
were the main buyers in the equity market,purchasing 33.6 billion worth of German
shares. Domestic non-banks reduced theirequity portfolios by 31.3 billion while credit
institutions reduced theirs by 34.2 billion.
Mutual fund sharesDomestic mutual funds placed shares worth
31.5 billion (net) in July. After a decrease of
30.9 billion in June, the volume outstanding
of shares in mutual funds open to the generalpublic increased by 33.5 billion. Money mar-
ket funds recorded inflows of resources ( 33.8
billion) for the first time for more than a year,while share-based and bond-based funds ex-
perienced outflows of the order of 30.2 bil-
lion and 30.9 billion respectively. By contrast,
the amount outstanding of shares in othermutual funds open to the general public re-mained virtually unchanged. The specialisedfunds earmarked for institutional investors re-corded outflows amounting to 32.1 billion.
The volume of foreign mutual fund sharesoutstanding rose by 30.1 billion.
On balance, foreign investors were the sole
purchasers of mutual fund shares in July ( 33.7
billion) while both domestic investor groupsredeemed fund shares. Credit institutions re-duced their holdings of shares issued by do-mestic and foreign mutual funds by 30.6 bil-
lion in each case. Non-banks sold 31.6 billionSales and purchases

Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus of 33.1 billion in July compared with one
of37.7 billion in the previous month. This de-
cline is attributable to a substantial increasein the deficit on invisible current transactions,which comprise services, factor income andcurrent transfers. There was also a decline inthe trade surplus.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the trade surplus wentdown by 31.2 billion from the June figure to
313.5 billion in July. In seasonally adjusted
terms, the surplus fell by 3
1/C252billion to just
under 313 billion as there was a stronger in-
crease in the imports of goods than in the ex-ports of goods. Exports went up by 3
1/C252%i n
July compared with the previous monthwhereas imports increased by 6%. TakingMay, June and July together, exports rose by3
1/C252% in seasonally adjusted terms compared
with the previous three months. Althoughthe increase in the value of imports in thethree-month comparison was slightly greater(+4%), this was due partly to price develop-ments.
The deficit on invisible current transactions in-
creased in July by 33.1 billion on the month
to39.2 billion. This rise was attributable
mainly to the increase in net expenditure oncross-border factor income. Consequently,there was a deficit on factor income of 32.5Major items of the balance

There were net capital imports amounting to
39.6 billion through securities transactions
with non-residents in July 2004. This repre-sents a distinct turnaround, following totalnet exports of 336.2 billion in the previous
four months. The main reason for this wasthat non-residents invested larger amounts inGerman securities ( 320.2 billion compared
with 35.0 billion in June). In particular, bonds
and notes ( 314.0 billion) – predominantly
public sector bonds ( 312.1 billion) – benefited
from their increased interest. In addition, for-eigners also added German shares ( 33.6 bil-
lion) and mutual fund shares ( 33.7 billion) to
their portfolios whereas they sold moneymarket paper, on balance ( 31.0 billion). Ger-
man investors continued to invest fairly heav-ily in foreign financial centres ( 310.6 billion
compared with 313.2 billion), notably in debt
securities ( 310.4 billion). All of these were
euro-denominated bonds and notes from EUpartner countries ( 311.0 billion). In addition,
they bought foreign money market paper(32.2 billion) whereas they sold net amounts
of dividend-bearing paper ( 32.0 billion).
Direct investment resulted in net outflows of
funds totalling 31.2 billion in July. German
proprietors withdrew 30.6 billion from their
non-resident subsidiaries, largely in the formof investment capital. Conversely, foreignenterprises reduced their direct investmentstocks in Germany by 31.8 billion.
In the case of statistically recorded non-
securitised credit transactions, the operationsof enterprises and individuals led to net out-flows of funds amounting to 32.9 billion in
July. This was the result of the increase insight deposits with banks outside Germanyand the redemption of loans. By contrast, theexternal transactions of general governmentwere almost in balance ( 30.1 billion). The net
external position of the overall banking sys-tem (excluding the reserve assets of the Bun-desbank) – in which other current and finan-cial transactions are reflected – went up by35.3 billion during the month under review.
There were outflows of funds both from theBundesbank ( 32.4 billion) – primarily through
the payment system TARGET – and from Ger-man credit institutions ( 32.8 billion).
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets – at transac-
tion values – fell by 30.8 billion in July.Portfolio

15The performance
of German credit
institutions in 2003Last year still saw no substantial recov-
ery in the performance of Germancredit institutions. Sluggish cyclicaldevelopment and the necessary re-structuring processes in the banking in-dustry weighed heavily on many insti-tutions’ profitability, although notice-able differences in performance wereobserved across the various categor-ies of banks. Their published non-consolidated financial statements indi-cate that, on balance, German bankscontinued to achieve only weak net in-come from their operating business infinancial year 2003. However, theywere able to make progress in their ef-forts to reduce costs and increased con-siderably their earnings from propri-etary trading. Moreover, a certain eas-ing in risk provisioning was observed.However, the slide in the “extraordin-ary account” depressed overall earn-ings to a considerable extent. As a re-sult, the profit for the financial yearbefore tax fell perceptibly; if taxes onincome and earnings are taken intoaccount, the figure was actually nega-tive. For financial year 2004, however,an easing of the situation is in sight asimprovements in expenditure, in par-ticular, are becoming more evidentand the real economic recovery is likelyto have a positive impact on the creditinstitutions’ earnings.

16Income from interest business
In 2003 interest business developments were
characterised mainly by banks’ efforts to cre-ate the conditions for a structural improve-ment in their performance by consistently ad-justing their balance sheets for risk assets.However, the decline in the volume of busi-ness, particularly in the area of riskier loanswith a higher rate of interest, depressed netinterest received. Following an improvement
in the interest business in 2002, net interestreceived fell by 33.8 billion to 381.8 billion in
2003. Unlike the situation in 2002, the fur-ther marked decrease in interest received (by335.7 billion to 3308.8 billion) could not be
offset by a reduction in interest paid (by331.9 billion to 3227.0 billion). As a result,
the interest margin – the ratio of net interestreceived to the balance sheet total – fell from1.20% in financial year 2002 to 1.16% in2003.
On the liabilities side, banks did benefit from
the stronger preference for liquidity amonginvestors, which effected a marked increasein their sight deposits, thus perceptibly decel-erating interest paid. At more than 10%,overnight deposits of domestic non-banksreached a percentage of their balance sheettotal last seen at the end of the 1960s. How-ever, the weak development of interest re-ceived, which was caused by the banks’ on-going reduction of mainly higher-interestbearing risk assets, was the factor determin-ing the overall picture. For example, lendingto the domestic private sector as a percent-age of the balance sheet total declined againin 2003. Against a backdrop of weak invest-ment activity, the share in the business vol-ume of loans to enterprises, in particular,registered a further decline. At 12
1/C252%, it was
clearly below the average for the last 30 yearsof just under 16
1/C252%. Although the percent-
age of the more important loans to house-holds rose slightly in relation to the balancesheet total in the year under review to justunder 29%, it was nevertheless still below itslong-term average.DM

17Net interest received declined primarily at
commercial banks. In this category of banks,the big banks in particular, which in the previ-ous year had contributed heavily to the rise ininterest business, registered a marked declinein net interest received. All in all, theysuffered a drop in the interest margin of0.25 percentage point to 0.85%. The sharpreduction in interest paid was not enough tooffset the renewed decline in interest re-ceived from lending and money market trans-actions and the perceptible decrease in cur-rent income from shares in affiliated enter-prises. This decrease resulted to a large extentfrom the sale by a big German bank of itsstakes in industry in the previous year.At the commercial banks – and especially at
the big banks – weak interest received wouldappear to be related to the distinct reductionin risk assets. The ratio of loans to the balancesheet total has declined markedly and con-tinuously since the end of the 1990s, whilethe corresponding share of big banks’ loansto domestic enterprises and households fellfrom 40% in 1999 to 27
1/C252% in the year
under review. At the same time, in contrastto other banking groups, the big banks wereunable to benefit on the liabilities side froman increase in non-banks’ sight deposits. As inthe past few years, overnight deposits ac-counted for just under 12% of the balancesheet total – 3

18However, even those banking groups whose
net interest received traditionally accounts fora far larger share of operating business alsosaw that share decline in 2003. At savingsbanks it was down from 81.3% to 80.6% onthe year and at credit cooperatives downfrom 79.1% to 75.4%. At the same time,however, both the savings banks and thecredit cooperatives registered a slight increasein net interest received (+ 30.3 billion to 323.5
billion and + 30.4 billion to 314 billion respect-
ively). As a result, the interest margin, which istraditionally much higher at these two cat-egories of banks than at the other categoriesof institutions, remained virtually unchangedin financial year 2003 at 2.42% for the sav-ings banks and 2.53% for the credit coopera-tives. At the savings banks, however, this waspartly a result of the first decline in the volumein business for ten years. Of those categoriesof banks which, owing to their focus on inter-bank and wholesale banking business, typical-ly have a narrower interest margin, the Lan-desbanken managed to increase their netinterest received again moderately from 39.7
billion in 2002 to 310.3 billion. By contrast,
the regional institutions of credit cooperativesrecorded a considerable decline of 30.5 billion
in net interest received, taking that positionto30.9 billion. While the volume of business
increased slightly, the interest margin fell by0.2 percentage point to 0.46%.

The slight rise in commissions received waslargely offset by a rise in commissions paid.
On a positive note, however, banks managed
to stabilise their net commissions receiveddespite generally declining turnovers in Ger-man share trading and the underwriting busi-ness. Mainly as a result of increasing shareprices since the second quarter of 2003,banks were able to post growth in their in-come from securities and safe custody busi-ness during the rest of the year. Growth – insome cases considerable – was also achievedin commissions from payment transactions.By contrast, commission business declined atsubsidiaries.At the commercial banks – which earned just
under 55% of the domestic credit institu-tions’ net commissions received – net com-missions received fell to 313.2 billion, or
-30.6 billion year on year. However, this was
less the result of declining commission busi-ness at the big banks than at the other com-mercial banks. By contrast, savings banks andcredit cooperatives benefited from a highernet figure for commissions received. Savingsbanks increased their net commissions re-ceived by 30.4 billion to 35.2 billion while
credit cooperatives posted growth in this itemof30.3 billion to 33.4 billion. Even so, as a

20Net profit or net loss on financial
operations
In the light of the ongoing price recovery in
the international equity markets, domesticbanks were again able to boost considerablytheir net profit on financial operations in fi-nancial year 2003. With net profit of 36.4 bil-
lion in own-account trading, German creditinstitutions attained record figures last seen in2000; in 2003 they increased their year-on-year net profit on financial operations by 33.5
billion. This was again largely attributable tothe big banks. Following an extraordinarilypoor result in 2002, these banks doubledtheir net profit on financial operations andachieved the highest net profit figure everachieved in own-account trading ( 34.9 bil-
lion). By comparison, trading in the other cat-egories of banks benefited only moderately
from rising equity prices. The Landesbankeneven registered a slight decline in their netprofit on financial operations.
Administrative expenditure
Cost-cutting programmes at the large Ger-
man credit institutions again had an obviouspositive impact on administrative expenditurein 2003, even though that impact was farweaker than in the previous year. At 377.3
billion, general administrative spending in theyear under review was only 31.0 billion down
on the previous year’s level. In 2002 domesticbanks had already reduced their administra-tive costs by 32.7 billion. Major administrative
savings were recorded by the big banks. Theycut their general administrative spendingfrom 321.8 billion to 321.0 billion. Even so,
the considerable reduction in the balancesheet total in this category of institutions re-sulted in an increase in administrative costs asa percentage of the volume of business. Bycontrast, savings banks and credit coopera-tives recorded a further increase in generaladministrative spending again in 2003.
Although domestic banks reduced the num-
ber of employees even more strongly in 2003than in 2002, extensive severance paymentsprevented them from further reducing staffcosts in the period under review. While thenumber of employees decreased by 27,000,or 3.7%, staff costs stagnated at 341.6 billion
in financial year 2003. Most of the job cuts(17,000) again occurred in the private bank-ing sector. Even so, commercial banks onlyAs a percentage of the balance sheet total

billion to 317.0 billion. Savings banks even
registered a slight increase in staff costs (by30.4 billion to 311.7 billion), despite shedding
jobs. Staff costs also rose slightly at the creditcooperatives in financial year 2003 while onlya relatively moderate number of jobs wereshed in this category of banks. The Landes-banken achieved the largest relative reduc-tion (5.6%) in staff costs, taking their figureto33.4 billion.
The slight drop in general administrative
spending in 2003 was mainly a result of de-velopments in other administrative spending,ie mainly non-staff expenditure, expenditureon third-party services and depreciation oftangible fixed assets. All in all, domestic creditinstitutions managed to reduce their otheradministrative spending by 31.0 billion to
335.7 billion. Savings in this area were real-
ised primarily by commercial banks. Both bigbanks and regional banks made progress inthis area.

Operating result before the valuation
of assets
Overall, the decline in the partial operating
result, ie the sum of net interest and net com-missions received and the general administra-
tive spending, was more than offset by themarked increase in net income from own-account trading. As a result, there was ultim-ately a slight increase in the operating resultbefore the valuation of assets from 338.2 bil-

under review. Consequently, the cost/incomer a t i oa l s oi m p r o v e ds o m e w h a ti n2 0 0 3 .H o w -ever, the decline in this ratio was far smaller inthe period under review than in 2002. Besidesthe big banks and the regional institutions ofcredit cooperatives, all categories of credit insti-tutions registered a slight improvement. Theimprovement was particularly strong at thecredit cooperatives and the Landesbanken.
The picture is somewhat different, however, if
the cost/income ratio is related to gross earn-ings. The perceptible decline in interest re-ceived left its mark on earnings. This ultimatelyled to a rise in the ratio of general administra-tive spending to gross earnings (defined as thesum of net interest received and net commis-sions received) of 1.5 percentage points to72.8%, following a decline of 6.2 percentagepoints in 2002. Owing to the marked fall intheir net interest received, this increase wasconcentrated, however, at the big banks andthe regional institutions of credit cooperatives.

ings. Net charges from the valuation of loans,claims and securities totalled 321.8 billion in
2003, ie less than in the previous year. On theone hand, write-offs and write-downs droppedby310.9 billion to 323.4 billion; on the other
hand, however, value adjustments and releaseof provisions fell by 31.4 billion to 31.6 billion.

Even so, on balance there was a perceptible
decline in valuation expenditure; in relation tothe average balance sheet total, it was 0.31%in the year under review, following 0.28% in2001 and 0.44% in 2002. Furthermore, in2003 (in accordance with section 340 (g) ofthe German Commercial Code) 31.9 billion net
was transferred to the fund for general bank-ing risks. The increase in this fund is not reflect-ed, however, in lower net annual profit asthese funds are factored into the disposition ofprofit (accumulation of reserves).
As in previous years, by far the largest share
of risk provisions at German banks in 2003 islikely to have been related to domestic lend-ing. Credit institutions continued to deal witha large number of corporate insolvencies –which actually increased by 4.9% to 39,470in the year under review. However, small en-terprises were hit harder than in the previousyear. By contrast, the percentage of large in-solvencies, which had increased sharply in2002, declined in 2003. The fact that risk pro-visions were reduced despite an increase ininsolvencies may reflect, among other things,greater risk awareness on the part the Ger-man credit institutions as far as their lendingCredit institutions’ cost/income ratios,

24business is concerned. Owing to the relatively
low share of consumer credit in banks’ overalllending to domestic enterprises and house-holds, consumer insolvencies are again likelyto have played only a secondary role inbanks’ risk provisioning in 2003. Given theirvery strong growth, which in the year underreview again far outstripped the increase incorporate insolvencies, risk provisions for con-sumer credit could in the future have a moremarked negative impact on banks’ perform-ance. Write-downs on debt securities, whichaccrue in part to net income or net chargesfrom the valuation of assets, amounted to31.9 billion in 2003, following 31.0 billion in
the previous year.
2
An examination of the situation at the cat-egories of banks shows that the decrease inthe risk provisions was particularly strong for
those groups which had posted a relativelysharp increase in the previous year. First, thismeant those credit institutions which, like thebig banks and the Landesbanken, are activein wholesale banking and which in 2002were particularly affected by large insolven-cies. Second, savings banks and credit co-operatives operating in retail business made adistinct reduction in their net charges fromthe valuation of assets. Even so, in 2003 – asin the past few years – these two categoriesof banks had to cope with relatively high riskprovisions as a percentage of their averagebalance sheet totals. At savings banks this fig-ure was 0.54% (2002: 0.71%) and at creditcooperatives 0.56% (2002: 0.67%).Operating result before net income or net charges from the valuation of assets*

25Despite continued high risk provisions, the
weakening negative impact of net chargesfrom the valuation of assets resulted in theoperating result for the German banking in-dustry as a whole more than doubling from37.0 billion in the previous year to 317.4 bil-
lion in 2003. All the categories of banks im-proved their operating result, some consider-ably.
Other and extraordinary income
or charges
In the year under review, net other and extra-
ordinary income or charges reduced the over-all result by an unusually large amount; from33.9 billion in 2002, it dropped to - 315.5 bil-
lion in 2003. There are, however, striking sub-stantial differences among the categories of
banks. Although the contributions to profitmade by the “extraordinary account” deteri-orated at all categories of banks, the effecton the overall result was particularly strong atthe big banks (- 38 billion from - 32 billion in
2002) and the Landesbanken (- 34.6 billion
from - 33.4 billion in 2002). At - 32.5 billion
(2002: - 30.6 billion), regional banks and
other commercial banks also registered con-siderable losses in the “extraordinary ac-count”. Much the same can be said of mort-gage banks and the regional institutions ofcredit cooperatives. By contrast, the savingsbanks’ and the credit cooperatives’ result wasbolstered somewhat by the “extraordinaryaccount”.Relative significance of major income and cost items for individual categories of

26The slump was driven by a considerable de-
cline in the net result from financial in-vestment business at credit institutions; itdropped 313.9 billion from 38.6 billion in
2002 to - 35.3 billion in 2003. On the one
hand, those credit institutions which recorded(net) income from value adjustments in re-spect of participating interests, shares in affili-ated enterprises and transferable securitiesexperienced a drop of 39.9 billion in their net
receipts from financial investment business;
3
on the other hand, at the other institutions,charges connected with the correspondingwrite-downs and value adjustments rose by34.1 billion. The overall negative net result
from financial investment business primarilyreflects value adjustments of participatinginterests and is concentrated almost exclu-sively at the big banks and Landesbanken. Al-though the result at most of the institutions
in these two categories was affected nega-tively by the result of their financial invest-ment business, the average performance wasaffected noticeably by especially sharp de-clines at individual institutions.
This was compounded by declining net results
of the extraordinary income and charges inthe narrower sense across all the categoriesof banks (- 34.2 billion after 31.5 billion in
2002). While this did not have a major impacton the earnings of most of the categories ofbanks, it reduced considerably the income ofthe big banks. Apart from charges connectedwith restructuring, the revaluation of secur-ities and participating interests also played arole, becoming the dominant factor in theoverall “extraordinary account”. Transferredprofits increased slightly from 33.2 billion in
2002 to 33.6 billion in the year under review.
The negative developments could not be off-set by the other items in the “extraordinaryaccount”: income from the release of specialreserves shrank (to 30.4 billion from 30.8 bil-
lion in 2002)
4and the overall decline in the
charges from loss transfers (- 32.7 billion after
-33.8 billion), albeit with marked variations
across the individual categories of banks, wasnot great enough to counter this negativeimpact.DM bn € bn

of the option of offsetting these two items. Pursuant to
section 340 (c) (2) of the German Commercial Code,
such offsetting permits the inclusion of income and

27Taxes on income and earnings,
profit for the financial year
In the year under review, the considerable
negative impact from the “extraordinary ac-count” far exceeded the increase in the oper-ating result, the upturn of which was there-fore unable to bear positive fruit in terms ofprofit for the financial year before tax. Conse-quently, in 2003 profit for the financial yearbefore tax in the German banking industryfell year on year – from 310.9 billion in
2002 to 31.9 billion. In accordance with the
development in the “extraordinary account”,however, the various categories of bank pre-sented a differentiated picture: the big banks,which had already booked losses for the yearbefore tax in 2002 (- 31.9 billion) made losses
of37.3 billion in 2003. The Landesbanken,
which made a profit of 31.3 billion in 2002,
booked losses of 32.2 billion in 2003. Region-
al banks and other credit institutions also suf-fered major declines; their profit for the finan-cial year before tax fell from 32.8 billion in
2002 to 31.5 billion in 2003. Mortgage banks
also recorded declines in 2003. By contrast,the savings banks (+ 34.8 billion) and the
credit cooperatives (+ 32.9 billion) were able
to make a perceptible year-on-year improve-ment in their profit for the year before tax.
Owing to the overall unfavourable earnings
trend, the return on equity before tax, calcu-lated as an average of all the banks, declinedsharply again in 2003 after having worsenedconsiderably in 2002. The figure was 0.73%in the year under review, following 4.49% in2002; however, there were some major diver-gences across the various categories ofbanks. The overall low figure in the banking
industry was mainly caused by decliningprofits at the big banks and the Landesban-ken. By contrast, savings banks and credit co-operatives managed to increase their returnon equity before tax.
Taxes on income and earnings rose sharply by
31.7 billion to 35.5 billion in 2003 despite
generally declining annual profit – primarilyas a result of tax expenses at the savingsbanks. This was also related to income but,owing mainly to a special effect, was, at 33.0
billion, nearly double the amount of the pre-vious year.

28the previous year. In financial year 2003 the
big banks reported “tax receipts” of 30.5 bil-
lion in their non-consolidated accounts,which, however, mainly reflected the reduc-tion in provisions for taxation at one institu-tion. For most of the other categories ofbanks, taxes on income and earnings general-ly changed only slightly in the year underreview.
For the first time ever, the German banking
industry as a whole posted an annual lossafter tax of 33.7 billion, which resulted from
the losses made at the big banks and the Lan-desbanken. By contrast, the other categoriesof banks posted net profits for the year. Incalculating the balance sheet profit, earningsafter tax was, as in the two preceding years,again hit hard by substantial losses of 32.1billion being carried forward in the year
under review. Moreover, 31.9 billion was allo-
cated to the fund for general banking risks,also putting pressure on profits. Finally, thenecessary extensive drawings on provisionsand participation rights capital exceeded thecorresponding amounts transferred into theprovisions by 311.2 billion.
6On balance, the
reported balance sheet profit again fell con-siderably in 2003 – by 31.2 billion, or 26%,
to33.6 billion – from 36.6 billion in 2001 and
34.8 billion in 2002.Breakdown of other and extraordinary income or charges

29Outlook
Current figures for the first half of the year
suggest that the performance of credit insti-tutions can be expected to stabilise some-what in 2004. Owing to the value adjust-ments carried out in 2003 and the decliningrate of corporate insolvencies in the first halfof 2004, the need for risk provisioning in thedomestic lending business is likely to reducefurther. The same applies to value adjustmentin banks’ financial investment business. Therestructuring measures that have now beenimplemented should also have a stronger im-pact on administrative expenses as the one-off expenses (such as severance payments)associated with these measures are not likelyto affect the results as strongly as in previousyears. Compared with expenditure, the trendin income for 2004 is more difficult to fore-
cast. Net interest received is likely to be de-pressed in 2004 by the decline in the volumeof business in 2003, and particularly by thereduction in risk assets. Furthermore, devel-opments in assets-side business depends notleast on future cyclical developments. Ourcurrent estimates suggest that a slight expan-sion can be expected in this area. Given theinterest rate trends to date, it remains to beseen whether this will be reflected in highernet interest received. Owing to rather weakdevelopments in the equity markets in thefirst half of 2004, it will be difficult to achievea similar amount of income from own-account trading to that earned in the previ-ous year.Return on capital of individual categories of banks*

43Greater flexibility
on the German labour
marketThe German labour market has been
characterised for a long time now by ahigh degree of persistent structural un-employment. Up to the middle of the1990s, the number of unemployed per-sons rose from one business cycle tothe next. This phenomenon cannot beexplained by macroeconomic shocksalone. Institutional factors also have tobe taken into consideration. The con-tinuously high level of unemploymentis a clear indication that the German la-bour market is not functioning proper-ly. This has become increasingly appar-ent in the past few years. A number ofmeasures have been taken at companylevel as well as by the social partnersand legislators. These measures areaimed at overcoming rigidities andobstacles by improving frameworkconditions and increasing flexibility onthe labour market, with a view to re-ducing unemployment and raising therate of employment. This article givesan overview of the adjustment stepsthat have been taken to date. How-ever, it also demonstrates that there isa further need for action in order toachieve a comprehensive and lastingreduction in involuntary long-termunemployment.
Major imbalances on the labour market
Unemployment in Germany rose stepwise be-
tween the early 1970s and the mid-1990s.With each economic downturn the number

44of unemployed increased significantly. The
number of registered unemployed personswent up from an initial figure of just under300,000 in 1973 to over 1 million in 1975and then from around 900,000 in 1980 to2.2 million in 1982. In the first half of the1990s, pan-German unemployment in-creased again from around 3 million in 1992to almost 4.4 million in 1997. Although un-employment then dipped below 4 millionpersons, it has latterly returned to its 1997level if definitional changes are disregarded.This underlying pattern reveals – at themacroeconomic level – a clear failure to re-integrate the increased number of un-employed persons into the production pro-cess in any of the subsequent recoveryperiods, even allowing for the fact that the la-bour supply in Germany has increased sub-stantially over time. Furthermore, the short-
age of competitive jobs should be estimatedas being higher than the unemployment ratesuggests since a large number of employmentcontracts are subsidised and many other non-occupied persons should be at least partlyallocated to the labour supply.
This empirical finding is a clear indication that
the German labour market is not functioningproperly. Germany’s relatively poor labourmarket performance is evident not only fromconsidering its evolution over time, but alsowhen comparing it with that of other coun-tries in the European Union. According to thestandardised EU definition, Germany current-ly has one of the highest unemployment rates(9.9% seasonally adjusted) in the euro area.A high level of unemployment not only re-sults in large fiscal burdens in the form ofwage substitutes and lost revenue from wagetax and social security contributions, it alsoentails considerable financial losses and socialcosts for the individuals concerned.
For the economy as a whole, a high or in-
creasing level of unemployment means thatthe growth potential to improve the overallstandard of living is not being fully exploited.If people who lose their jobs during an eco-nomic downturn do not succeed in finding anew job during the subsequent upturn, theinitial cyclical unemployment will become in-creasingly entrenched and will ultimately betransformed into structural unemployment.The longer the latter persists, the more diffi-cult it is to eliminate, especially as the humancapital represented by the unemployed is at

Tasks for the social partners
and legislators
Improving the functioning of the labour mar-
ket requires cooperation from both the legis-lators and the social partners. The legislatorsare responsible for creating incentive-compatible legal and institutional frameworkconditions. The social partners have to ensurethat the terms and conditions of employmentcontracts conform to market standards. Allendeavours should ultimately be measured bythe extent to which they make a lasting con-tribution to increasing the level of employ-ment, thereby lowering unemployment. Theobjective should not be solely to compensatefor the jobs lost in the last few years, but tosignificantly reduce unemployment on a per-manent basis.
In view of the pressing problems on the Ger-
man labour market and against the back-ground of the intensification of the inter-national division of labour – which has in-creased in recent years and may be expectedto sharpen further in the futur e – a series of
measures were taken in the past few years– initially by the social partners – aimed atraising the flexibility and improving the func-tioning of the German labour market. Thiswas partly a response to the growing numberof employers withdrawing from the nationalfederations and the waning influence of col-lective labour contracts. In terms of legislativechanges, besides efforts to lower non-wagelabour costs, the German parliament recently
implemented a series of proposals drawn upby a group of experts known as the HartzCommission.
Collective labour agreements continue
to be of great importance
Achieving a permanently higher level of em-
ployment primarily requires action from thesocial partners. Collective labour agreementsbetween employer federations or companiesand trade unions perform a key function inthis context. According to data from the Fed-eral Ministry of Economics and Labour, therewere almost 60,000 industry or companyagreements in force at the end of 2003.These regulate both general working condi-tions – such as working hours, bonuses andholiday entitlement – in the form of masterlabour agreements, and the level of wagesand salaries in the form of wage agree-ments.
1According to the Federal Ministry of
Economics and Labour, around 90% of em-ployees who are subject to social securitycontributions are employed under collectiveindustry and company labour agreements.
According to the findings of the Institute of
Employment Research (IAB), the scope of cov-erage of industry-wide labour agreements de-clined noticeably, especially in the second halfof the 1990s. Whereas in the mid-1990s70% of employees in western Germanyworked in a company covered by a sector-wide collective labour agreement, since 2000

46this figure has stood at only 63%. A similar
trend is apparent in eastern Germany, albeiton a considerably smaller scale: only just overtwo-fifths of employees there work in a com-pany covered by an industry-wide labouragreement. In both western and eastern Ger-many the adherence to collective labouragreements correlates positively with the sizeof the enterprise. The smaller the company,the less likely it is to be covered by a collectivelabour agreement. In businesses with be-tween five and nineteen staff, merely half ofthe employees in western Germany and onlyone in three employees in eastern Germanyare covered by sector-wide labour contracts.Looking at the individual sectors, adherenceto collective agreements in western Germanyis particularly high in industry, construction,financial intermediation and general govern-ment, and low in the sectors “other business
services” and “other services”. In easternGermany, the scope of coverage of collectivepay and labour agreements is significantlylower than in western Germany in the indus-trial and construction sectors, in particular.
Besides these industry-wide labour agree-
ments, there are numerous company-specificpay agreements. These apply to 7% of em-ployees in western Germany and 12% ineastern Germany. However, according to theIAB many companies which themselves haveno collective labour contract nonethelessgear the remuneration of their workforce toscales laid down in collective agreements. In2002 this was the case for 16% of employeesin western Germany and 23% in eastern Ger-many. Including this group of people, theearnings of 86% of employees in westernGermany and 78% in eastern Germany arebased on collective agreements.
Negotiated pay rates, wage drift
and actual earnings
The continuing central importance of collect-
ive agreements in shaping wage formation inthe German economy suggests that negoti-ated pay rates should be the focal point ofany analysis of wage trends. Concentratingon hourly pay rates suggests itself for tworeasons. Firstly, this is the relevant yardstickused by companies to assess labour costs.Secondly, it enables due account to be takenof the effects that changes in working hours– for example as a result of the increasing sig-nificance of part-time employment – have on

thermore, it is advisable to begin the analysisin the mid-1990s because, particularly in thefirst half of the last decade, the pan-Germanwage trend was driven to a large degree bythe objective of harmonising wages in east-ern Germany with those in western Ger-many.

According to figures from the Deutsche Bun-desbank’s pay rate statistics,
3negotiated
hourly earnings – including agreed supple-mentary benefits, such as holiday pay andChristmas bonuses – in Germany increased by19% altogether between 1995 and 2003(2
1/C254% per annum). Broken down according
to region, this reflects an average increase of2% in western Germany and 3% in easternGermany. A comparison of economic sectors
4
shows that negotiated earnings in the pro-duction sector (excluding construction) rosethe most. The average annual increase of2
3/C254% exceeded the macroeconomic average
by1/C252percentage point each year, with the
metal-working and electrical engineering in-dustries recording the strongest growth. Bycontrast, negotiated pay rates in the servicesectors financing, renting and business ser-vices as well as in the public and private ser-vices sectors showed a marginally below-average increase over the past eight years.The smallest agreed wage increase (1
3/C254% per
year) occurred in the construction industry,which has been in an acute adjustment crisisfor years. Particularly between 1997 and1999, negotiated pay rates in this sector weresignificantly lower than the overall rate. In1997 this was due to the cut in holiday payand Christmas bonuses in the west Germanconstruction industry. Two years later Christ-
mas bonuses were lowered again, whereasholiday pay was raised.
5
The sectoral spread of annual negotiated payrises was – measured by various statisticalratios – somewhat narrower in the last fewyears than in the mid-1990s. This could be anindication that those sectors which recordedcomparatively high wage settlements in previ-ous years came under stronger pressure andthe trade unions were accordingly no longerable to achieve above-average wage agree-ments. Another possible interpretation is thatthe social partners oriented themselves moreclosely to macroeconomic benchmarks, inwhich case the deviations have sector-specificcauses or reflect the balance of power be-tween employer federations and tradeunions. On the whole there are a number of

nomics and Labour, the contractually agreed basic rates
of (monthly) pay in eastern Germany rose from 60% of
west German negotiated earnings at the end of 1991 to
87% at the end of 1995. By the end of 2003, this figure
was 93.5%. See Federal Ministry of Economics and

a simultaneous cut in Christmas bonuses has to be seen
in the context that in the construction sector holiday pay
is generally binding, whereas Christmas bonuses are not.

49factors indicating that the trend in pay rises is
still primarily determined by the traditionalpattern of annual pay rounds in which thefirst pay settlement in one of the larger eco-nomic sectors serves as a key benchmark forsubsequent pay agreements.
The level of and increase in actual gross earn-
ings are defined largely – but by no meansentirely – by the conclusion of collective payagreements. Depending on the relativestrength of the demand for labour, both thelevel and the evolution of actual wages andsalaries differ from the negotiated rates. Thepercentage difference between actual wagesand salaries per employee per hour and nego-tiated hourly wage and salary rates is reflect-ed in what economists call the wage drift(likewise on an hourly basis). This can also beseen as a certain corrective to the pay agree-ments.
In the period under review between 1995
and 2003, a slightly negative cumulativewage drift (calculated on an hourly basis) of1 percentage point – or 0.1 percentage pointper year – was recorded. There were, how-ever, strong fluctuations in the wage driftover time. A markedly positive wage driftwas observed in 1996 and, above all, in 2000and 2001. On the one hand, promptedby the joint declaration of the Alliance forjobs, training and competitiveness of 9 Janu-ary 2000 – which recommended anemployment-oriented and longer-term wagepolicy – the agreements in the 2000 payrounds produced moderate settlements,often running for two years, with further– likewise moderate – pay rises in the subse-quent year. On the other hand, the buoyant
cyclical conditions necessitated more over-time work – paid at higher rates. In 2002 and2003, by contrast, the increase in actual earn-ings – calculated per hour – was
3/C254percent-
age point per year lower than the rise in ne-gotiated wages. This gap widened to 1
1/C254per-
centage points in the first half of 2004. Evi-dently, companies have recently been usingthe wage drift as a corrective to negotiatedpay agreements which they felt were toohigh or in order to generally enhance theirprofitability. In the light of the German econ-omy’s long-running stagnant underlying ten-dency and its very restricted scope to pass onprice increases – even against the backgroundof increasing competition from foreign firmswith significant cost advantages – the soleoption to stabilise profitability was to curbwage costs by squeezing non-core wagecomponents.
6On balance, there is much to
suggest that the wage drift – at least duringthe period under review here – contains a cer-tain cyclical component but also reacts elas-tically to the level of the pay settlements inrelation to the overall economic situation.
Broken down by sector, the production sector
(excluding construction), construction andpublic and private services all exhibit, on bal-
6According to IAB figures, in 2002 43% of companies
bound by collective labour contracts in the private sector
in western Germany paid their employees more than the
standard agreed pay rates. The average wage spread, ie
the degree by which actual wages and salaries exceed
negotiated rates, amounted to almost 11%. In eastern
Germany, just under 20% of companies bound by col-
lective labour contracts paid more than the negotiated
pay rates, with an average wage spread of 10%. For

50ance, a very similar pattern to that of the
overall economy – albeit with some consider-able differences in the individual years. Bycontrast, the wage drift in the wholesale/re-tail trade, hotel and restaurant service, trans-port and storage sector and in the financing,renting and business services sector has beenpersistently negative since 1995. In the caseof the wholesale/retail trade, hotel and res-taurant service, transport and storage sector,this may have been the result of a structuraleffect. The growth rate of actual hourlywages is likely to have been depressed con-siderably by the increasing significance of lowskilled labour, for example in the form of low-paid part-time jobs (“mini-jobs”) – an effectwhich was mirrored insufficiently in the payrate statistics owing to their concentration onaverage earnings. In the case of the finan-cing, renting and business services sector, thesector’s comparatively low level of coverageby pay agreements probably played an im-portant role; this means that there is morescope for flexibility which was obviously alsoexploited by the companies. Overall, it is clearthat the relative sectoral wage drift is oftennegatively correlated year on year with therelative position of the sectoral negotiatedsalary increases. This, too, supports the hy-pothesis that the wage drift plays an import-ant role as a corrective of collective pay settle-ments.
On balance, actual earnings per hour worked
rose by just over 2% per annum between1995 and 2003, which was only marginallylower than negotiated pay rates. With regardto the individual sectors, only the productionsector (excluding construction) recorded anabove-average increase. In all other sectors,
the average growth rate of wages per hourworked was below the 2% mark. As a resultof the wage drift, the sectoral spread of theannual percentage change in actual earningsis narrower than that of negotiated payrates.
7
Wage flexibility
It is remarkable that, despite high unemploy-
ment, practically no decreases in actual earn-ings were observed at the sectoral level dur-ing the period under review. The sole excep-tion was the construction sector in 1997 and1998, when average hourly earnings were1.3% and 0.2%, respectively, lower than inthe previous year. For 1997 this was attribut-able to the aforementioned cut in holiday payand Christmas bonuses. In 1998, too, variouselements agreed as part of the pay settlementto lower costs noticeably dampened the in-come trend, as a result of which hourly earn-ings declined marginally.
8In addition, the re-
duction in the minimum wage introduced inSeptember 1997 for workers in the construc-tion industry is likely to have had an impact.
This phenomenon that nominal wages are
largely sticky downwards is evident not only
7In a microeconometric and more deeply disaggregated
sectoral analysis Bellmann and Gartner come to the con-
clusion that in the 1990s in “western and eastern Ger-
many the sector-specific wage differentials increased in
those economic sectors already paying high wages.” For

51at the sectoral level but also at an individual
level. Admittedly, evaluations of the 1% sam-ple of employed persons undertaken by theIAB for the period from the mid-1970s to themid-1990s shows that some employees didindeed see their earnings drop. However, thecross-workforce distribution pattern of an-nual wage modifications shows a peak at pre-cisely zero in almost each year of the periodunder review. Microeconometric studiesbased on this data set likewise indicate theexistence of considerable downward nominalwage rigidity.
9In an environment of low infla-
tion rates, such as in Germany, real wagescan then perform their market-clearing func-tion to a limited extent only.
On the one hand, nominal wage rigidities can
be explained by institutional factors. For ex-ample, the validity of pay settlements persistseven after a contract has expired or been ter-minated, so that its provisions remain in forceuntil a new contract has been concluded. Onthe other hand, fairness considerations alsoplay a role. Since employment contracts regu-late salary levels but do not concurrently spe-cify the details of the work to be carried outby employees, cuts in salaries could negative-ly influence their performance and quality ofwork. According to surveys of companies,such considerations play a significant role inthe avoidance of salary cuts – even whenthese are deemed necessary.
10A salary cut is
contemplated and also accepted by the em-ployees only when it is a necessary measureto ensure the survival of the company andconsequently to save the jobs in question.The empirically attested high rigidity of nom-
inal wages nevertheless obscures the factthat to some extent it is also possible toachieve wage flexibility within collective la-bour agreements. Besides the escape clausesthat have been agreed in several sectors,which provide for a reduction in workinghours and salaries in individual companies ifthis is necessary to safeguard jobs, thesemeasures also include the suspension or post-ponement of pay rises in companies whichfind themselves in a difficult economic situ-ation, pay ranges, performance-related wagecomponents and lower entry-level payrates.
11
With regard to wage flexibility, pay settle-ments agreed in the chemical industry areworth mentioning in particular. Back in 1994,lower entry-level pay rates were agreed forthe first year of employment for long-termunemployed persons (90%) as well as fornew staff and school/college leavers (95%).In mid-1997 a wage corridor was introducedas part of the master collective pay agree-

52ment; this has been exploited since 1998.
Under certain conditions, it allows theemployer and workers’ council to lower earn-ings and working hours for a limited periodby up to 10% vis-/C224-vis the negotiated rates.
12
In contrast to comparable escape clauses inother industries, these exceptional measurescan be triggered by the need to improve com-petitiveness in Germany as well as the aim ofsafeguarding employment.
13This includes in-
vesting in German sites with the objective ofmaintaining and promoting employment andavoiding a relocation of production or invest-ment abroad.
14
In several economic sectors deviations fromthe standard Christmas bonus provisions arepermitted at plant level. For example, com-panies in the west German chemical industry,depending on their commercial performance,may lower the “thirteenth monthly salary” –which according to the pay agreement shouldtotal 95% of a month’s income – to 80% orraise it to 125%. In the private banking indus-try there is a similar sliding range which like-wise allows lower and higher deviations. In2002 the option of a performance and profit-related variable remuneration system wasalso introduced in this sector. On the basis ofin-house agreements, 4% of an employee’sannual remuneration, ie around half of one-month’s salary per year, can be coupled to in-dividual performance criteria. This examplemakes it clear that collective pay agreementsand in-house wage flexibility are not mutuallyexclusive.
No progress has been made in the past few
years, however, with regard to the wagestructure according to different skill levels.
15
In almost all cases the negotiated pay rates
for all skill levels in a given sector were raisedby the same percentage. Adequate wageflexibility and wage differentiation, especiallyat the lower end of the qualification scale,would, however, be appropriate in order tocreate more employment opportunities forlow-skilled people with low labour productiv-ity.
16
Increased working time flexibility
The degree of flexibility achieved so far is con-
siderably greater in terms of working hoursthan in terms of earnings. Labour agreementsin most economic sectors contain provisionsfor deviating from the standard weekly work-ing hours. These notably include workingtime accounts, which in many cases wereintroduced some time ago. The accountingperiod over which the average negotiatedworking hours must be achieved is at leasttwelve months and in some sectors is muchlonger. The key advantage of working time
12These in-house agreements must also be approved by
the social partners.
13A comparable clause exists solely in the east German
construction sector, although it has only a low scope of
coverage by collective labour agreements according to
the IAB.
14In 2000 a comparable provision was included in the
master labour agreement. It relates to competitiveness
vis-/C224-vis labour agreements in other sectors and specifies
no ceiling for lowering earnings.
15The sole exception is the construction industry where
in 2002 the three lowest pay groups were amalgamated
to form one new – lower – wage group.

53accounts is that they allow the regular work-
ing hours, which are paid at standard rates,to be more effectively adjusted to the firm’soperational requirements. Avoiding the needto pay overtime bonuses at times of full orderbooks cuts costs. When demand is weak, theworking-time buffer contributes to stabilisingemployment. However, this greater working-time flexibility may also mean that, in somecircumstances, employment will react some-what more slowly to an improvement in theeconomic situation if the flexibility withregard to the working-time component isinitially exhausted.
Besides the instrument of working time ac-
counts, several economic sectors provide forthe possibility of varying the regular workinghours for all or part of the workforce. For ex-ample, companies in the chemical industrycan define the standard weekly workinghours for the entire workforce as a slidingrange between 35 and 40 hours on a per-manent basis. In the metal-working and elec-trical engineering industries it is possible forfirms with a highly skilled workforce to ex-tend the working week for a maximum ofhalf the employees to up to 40 hours, with acommensurate increase in the wage but paidat standard rates.
In mid-2004, a company belonging to a
major electrical engineering group raised theregular weekly working time of all its employ-ees from 35 to 40 hours with no correspond-ing increase in their wages. Furthermore, holi-day pay and Christmas bonuses are to be re-placed there by a profit-related annual pay-ment. This example makes it clear that cuts inhourly wages – in order, say, to improve com-
petitiveness and safeguard jobs in Germany –are more likely to be accepted if they come inthe form of an extension of working hoursand a possible reduction in bonus payments,but the monthly salary is kept broadly un-changed. The same pattern was observed tenyears ago (albeit involving a shortening ofworking time in that case) with the introduc-tion of the four-day week by an automobilegroup, when the cut in wages accompanyingthe reduction in working hours was achievedby decreasing the special annual bonuses,leaving the monthly remuneration un-changed.

54Reorientation of labour market policy
Last year the Federal Government started to
make the labour market infrastructure moreflexible with the first two Acts PromotingModern Labour Market Services. The effect-iveness of job placement activities under-taken by the labour exchanges is to be in-creased through more intensive support forunemployed persons, through greater con-tact with companies and through the add-itional acquisition of vacancies. The monthlyearnings ceiling for jobs qualifying as low-paid part-time work (“mini-jobs”) was raisedfrom 3325 to 3400 on 1 April 2003 and the
tax and social security rates applying to suchjobs were lowered (especially when carriedout as an ancillary activity to a full-time job).The employer merely pays a lump-sum to thestatutory health and pension insuranceschemes and in wage tax totalling 25%. Inorder to more fully exploit the employmentpotential in the field of household services,“mini-jobs” undertaken for private house-holds are subject to lower taxes and socialcontributions totalling only 12%. In addition,“mini-jobs” for households are tax-subsidised.As a general rule, in addition to a main jobwhich is subject to social security contri-butions, one low-paid part-time ancillaryactivity may now also be taken up withoutthe earnings from this being subject to thefull social security contribution rate. Thiscorresponds to the previous regulation thatapplied before 1 April 1999.
Moreover, to promote employment in the
low-wage sector, a sliding scale for employeecontributions to the social security funds wasintroduced in jobs which pay between 3400
and3800 (“midi-jobs”). The employee contri-
bution increases progressively and linearlyfrom 4% at the bottom of the scale to thefull employee contribution of currently 21%at the top-end of the scale.
Through greater support for unemployed per-
sons, more extensive contacts with com-panies and the acquisition of additional va-cancies by the Federal Employment Agency,the placement of jobless persons is to bespeeded up and hence overall unemploymentlowered. To mobilise the employment re-serves, greater use is to be made of tempor-ary jobs (subcontracted workers). For this pur-pose, personnel service agencies (PSA) wereintroduced throughout Germany. The func-tion of the PSAs is to subcontract un-employed persons to interested companiesand to qualify and train unplaced personsinbetween phases of subcontracted employ-ment. The employment contract must last atleast nine months and should not exceedtwelve months as a general rule. When thepersonnel service agencies were introducedat the beginning of 2004, restrictions on hir-ing out of labour were lifted. The special timelimitation ban, the reemployment ban, thesynchronisation ban and the restriction of thetransfer time to 24 months were all abol-ished. Instead, the adoption of negotiatedwages was made compulsory.
A further element of the labour market re-
forms is the introduction of additional assist-ance for setting up new businesses (“Meplc”) for a three-year test phase. Any un-employed person who re-enters the labour

employed entrepreneur is entitled to amonthly start-up grant, whereby certain in-come ceilings apply for earnings from self-employment. Furthermore, the setting up ofa business in the craft industry was madegenerally easier. As a rule, the stipulation of amaster craftsman’s qualification now appliesto only 41 instead of 94 craft professions.
As a result of the reorientation of labour mar-
ket policy, traditional instruments, which in-clude in particular job creation schemes andstructural adjustment measures, have de-creased in importance. They are being in-creasingly superseded by a range of measureswhich aim to integrate people directly intothe primary labour market. Furthermore,under the motto “Promote and push” strictercriteria were introduced for registering as un-employed; this began with the Job-AQTIV
law (an act designed to get people back intowork).
At the beginning of 2005, unemployment as-
sistance and social assistance for thosepeople able to work but needing financialhelp will be replaced by the so-called “un-employment benefit II”. This new subsistenceallowance will be means-tested and will nor-mally equal the level of social assistance.With regard to the labour market, every jobwill be deemed reasonable for recipients ofunemployment benefit II to take up. Earningallowances in addition to the benefit are in-tended to motivate recipients to take onregular employment. Finally, as from 2006the maximum period of entitlement to un-employment benefit will be generally reducedto 12 months (and 18 months for people
over the age of 55); this should likewiseboost the incentive to find a job.
All measures must be assessed by the extent
to which they make a permanent contribu-tion to a more efficient labour market clear-ing process, thus promoting growth andstructural change. It is especially important toimprove the labour market opportunities ofthe long-term unemployed and of low-skilledpeople in order to more effectively combatthe potential emergence of new long-termunemployment.
As the measures that have been introduced
have had little time to show an impact and assome changes will not come into force before2005 or 2006, the success of the overallpackage of measures cannot yet be gauged.For one thing, many reform measures requiretime before their full impact will be felt. An-other difficulty is that there are still gaps andambiguities in the statistical base. For ex-ample, there are differences in the figures onlow-paid part-time jobs as recorded by theFederal Employment Agency and the Miners’Federal Statutory Health Insurance Scheme,which has been the central reporting officefor such jobs since April 2003. Figures on“midi-jobs” are currently only available basedon data from the IAB. According to those fig-ures, 3% of employees in western Germanyand 4% in eastern Germany have “midi-jobs”. The new form of self-employment hasmet with a high take-up rate according to evi-dence from the Federal Employment Agency.Thus in July, 150,000 people claimed the gov-ernment grant for setting up a “Me plc”.

56However, it remains to be seen how many of
these new businesses will be able to holdtheir own on the market. The personnel ser-vice agencies were recently supervising onlyaround 26,000 people. Pure placementratios, which are often cited, are not very in-formative, especially since – quite apart fromthe “bandwagon” effect – they cannot giveany information for the duration of the em-ployment contract. This also makes it clearthat the real placement success cannot bededuced from the number of supportedpersons.
However, the statistical picture does at least
show that, at long last, things have startedmoving again on the labour market. Further-more, the abandonment of the old-style ac-tive labour market policy is to be welcomed.That policy entailed high fiscal costs but ef-
fectively produced rather meagre results. Thestronger pressure on the unemployed to ac-tively seek work is likewise conducive to im-proving the job-hunting process and shouldmake the unemployment statistics more in-formative.
17Not least, alleviating the “pro-
gression trap” in the field of transfer pay-ments as a result of the new earnings allow-ances when re-entering the labour market isa step in the right direction. The modifiedregulation of “mini-jobs” and “midi-jobs”also highlights the important role of labourcosts, particularly for low-skilled people andjobs.
Further action needed for labour market
policy and wage policy
The key need now is to generally reduce the
tax wedge on the labour market. Particularlyas a result of the significant rise in contribu-tion rates to the social security funds, theratio of taxes and social security contributionsto labour costs went up from 43% in 1991 to48
1/C252% in 1997; this undoubtedly had a nega-
tive impact on the demand for labour. Al-though the burden of taxes and social secur-ity contributions had gone down marginallyto 47
1/C254% by 2001, another rise to just over
48% was recorded in the past two years. Thismeans that for every euro incurred by anemployer as labour costs for his employee,the employee receives less than 52 cents. Inreal terms, the evolution of the tax wedge1991 = 100, log scale

57over the past 13 years is even more unfavour-
able. This is because consumer prices, whichfor consumers are the crucial yardstick for de-termining their real net labour income, in-creased by just under 2% on an annual aver-age and thus almost
1/C252percentage point per
year more sharply than producer prices be-fore tax, measured by the GDP deflator atfactor costs. On balance, real hourly labourcosts per employee per hour have risen byover 24% since 1991 (or by 1.8% per year),whereas real net earnings per employee perhour have gone up by only 8% (or 0.7% peryear).
The measures taken in the past few years
have certainly resulted in the German labourmarket becoming more flexible, both with re-spect to the institutional framework and asregards collective wage bargaining and work-ing hours. To that extent there is reason tohope that the incipient economic recovery inGermany will also give a fillip to the labourmarket following a certain time-lag. It is dubi-ous, however, whether this will be sufficientto reduce unemployment in Germany to anysignificant degree. In particular, the ever-sharper international competition for invest-ment in manufacturing locations and jobsmeans that the pressure to become moreadaptable will remain strong or even increasefurther in the future. Hence further effortsare needed in the field of wage structures ifthe labour potential which until now has re-
mained untapped is to be put to productiveuse. In addition, the across-the-board cuts inweekly working hours made during the past20 years, and which were unsuccessful in em-ployment policy terms, should be supersededby provisions which better accommodate op-erational requirements and are also more inthe employees’ interests.
The German parliament is also called upon to
make its contribution to a more flexible la-bour market. A prime consideration in thiscontext is that employment protection legisla-tion has a considerable impact on firms’ re-cruitment policy. Furthermore, the “favour-ability principle”, which only allows devi-ations from the collective labour agreement ifthey are in the employees’ best interests,should be more broadly interpreted to includejob-saving aspects. This must be accompan-ied, as planned, by further narrowing the taxwedge on the labour market. In the processthe individual freedom of contract should beenhanced. It is not advisable, by contrast, tointroduce a statutory minimum wage. Wagesshould primarily perform a steering functionon the labour market and not be used for so-cial policy aims through legislative interven-tions. From the point of view of employmentpolicy, a minimum wage would be counter-productive and would conflict with the ob-jectives of the current labour market reform.

59How the Bundesbank
analyses enterprises’
creditworthinessIn fulfilment of its monetary policy
mandate as part of the Eurosystem, theBundesbank grants temporary refinan-cing loans and intraday credit to do-mestic credit institutions. For the ne-cessary collateralisation, the banks maypledge, among other assets, loans andbill-based loans to domestic (non-bank) enterprises.
Before the Bundesbank accepts a busi-
ness loan as collateral, it applies itscredit assessment system to examinewhether the enterprise in questionmeets the eligibility requirements forcentral bank refinancing. This articledescribes the improvements in themethodology which have been intro-duced since the launch of monetaryunion in 1999 and explains what creditstandards are set by the Bundesbankfor accepting business loans as collat-eral.
A central bank’s interest in a systematic
balance-sheet-based corporate analysisgoes beyond the issue of collateralisa-tion. The knowledge gained in creditanalysis is also relevant to the monet-ary transmission mechanism, for ex-ample. Moreover, the resulting insightsinto enterprises’ financial position andprofitability provide important infor-mation for assessing the stability of thefinancial system.

60Underlying assets fulfilling the
eligibility criteria
Article 18.1 of the Statute of the European
System of Central Banks (ESCB) stipulatesthat credit operations of the national centralbanks, such as the Bundesbank, be based onadequate collateral. At present, the eligibleassets are still divided into two categories: tierone assets, ie bonds issued by public sectorborrowers, banks or enterprises which fulfiluniform eligibility criteria specified by theEuropean Central Bank (ECB), and tier twoassets, which include non-marketable debtinstruments (in Germany, trade bills and bankloans), which are defined by the national cen-tral banks in accordance with the minimumeligibility criteria of the ECB.
On 29 August 2002, the Governing Council
of the ECB made a decision to phase in a sin-gle list to replace the two-tier system. On5 August 2004, there was a press release stat-ing that the Governing Council had agreed toinclude bank loans in (as well as to excludeequities from) the single list but that furtherpreparatory work was needed to settle theprecise arrangements, including the datewhen the single list would enter into force.This decision permits a considerable expan-sion of the collateral base. In particular, thedecision takes account of the underlying con-ditions in the German banking system and isalso consistent with the tradition in the Ger-man central banking system that debt instru-ments vis-/C224-vis business enterprises can alsobe used for central bank lending. Until thechangeover to monetary union, this had beenthe case for rediscount credit.
1For credit insti-tutions, the inclusion of bank loans means
that their securities portfolio is more availablefor purposes of collateralisation in the moneymarket and in payments. For that reason, in2003 during a Europe-wide ECB consultationon the gradual introduction of a single list,the credit institutions were very much infavour of including bank loans.
Credit standards
The quality criteria for the assets and their
suitability for the monetary policy operationsof the Eurosystem (and for the collateralisa-tion of payment transactions) are alreadyidentical in both lists of the present two-tiersystem. The credit standards for tier oneassets are those which lead to a rating in theupper to first-class range when classified by arating agency. Business loans meet these cri-teria if such a rating exists in the case of liableenterprises or if the loans are classified as eli-gible assets by a national central bank. Thismeans that the minimum standard for eligibleenterprises in the Eurosystem is higher than itwas for the Bundesbank’s rediscount businessprior to monetary union. Up to the end of1998, an enterprise was deemed to be eli-gible if it was judged to be viable. The groupof eligible enterprises has been restricted toviable enterprises which achieve a high tofirst-class credit rating. Even so, it is by nomeans the case that there is now a narrowerrange of enterprises whose bank loans are eli-gible for refinancing purposes. As before, eli-

from many different sectors and have a widevariety of legal forms (see the adjacent chart).
In the interests of a level playing field for
banks and enterprises, the Bundesbank’scredit risk assessment system is bound byguidelines which apply to all the national cen-tral banks in the Eurosystem that employtheir own credit risks assessment systems forrating the eligibility of business enterprises.

Compliance with the minimum creditworthi-ness standard is verified by comparing the an-nually determined default rate
3of the enter-
prises classified as eligible using a standardbenchmark. This benchmark is based on em-pirical default rates of tier one assets. An ap-plication for court insolvency proceedingsagainst the enterprise is in itself deemed tobe the default of an asset.
In order to comply with the more stringent
benchmark set by the Governing Council ofthe ECB, it became necessary last year toapply a stricter criterion when determiningthe eligibility of the enterprises assessed bythe Bundesbank. Otherwise, there wouldhave been a risk of the quality of our centralbank credit risk assessment system beingbelow the standards agreed by the Eurosys-tem. The comparatively high default rateswere a reflection of a deteriorating economicsetting for German enterprises over an ex-tended period, particularly of a growing ag-

62gregate output gap, ie the gap between real
performance and potential. This led to an in-creasing percentage of the debtors deemedto be eligible for central bank refinancing ac-tually not displaying the requisite viability.Changes to the insolvency law, which cameinto effect on 1 January 1999, were an add-itional factor. The new insolvency proceduremeans that enterprises, by means of restruc-turing, have a better chance to overcomeeconomic difficulties that threaten their exist-ence than was the case under the old law,when insolvency often led to the disintegra-tion of the company. For that reason, peti-tions for insolvency were often made wheneconomic difficulties are at a comparativelyearly stage. Both factors played a part in adoubling of the default rate of all the enter-prises assessed by the Bundesbank. Giventhat situation, it was imperative that weadapted our credit risk classification system tothe changed underlying economic conditions.
The Bundesbank’s credit risk
assessment system
The system applied by the Bundesbank en-
sures that credit assessments are derived in auniform and systematic assessment processwhich is transparent for the enterprises beingassessed and which reflects the particularneeds of refinancing operations. The systemconsists of two modules: a standardised part,which is a combination of discriminant analy-sis and an expert system, and the formationof the credit assessment, which ultimately de-termines eligibility for central bank refinan-cing.The method used by the Bundesbank (see the
chart on p 63) is based on the annual ac-counts as the key source of financial informa-tion on enterprises. It employs a model-basedprocessing of quantitative and qualitativedata (discriminant analysis supplemented byan expert system). The system establishes aclassification proposal for each enterprise thatis to be assessed. This proposal serves as thebasis for the binary credit assessment, ie eli-gible or ineligible. In establishing the creditassessment, the relevant bodies – RegionalOffice or Bundesbank branch – make use ofadditional information that cannot be in-cluded systematically in our standardisedmodel-based processing.
Several of the risk assessment methods
known in theory and in practice were exam-ined by the Bundesbank to ascertain theirsuitability for central bank lending business.Some of these methods were unsuitable onaccount of various set objectives and data re-quirements, especially the large number ofenterprises to be assessed (currently around22,000 annually) and the necessity of individ-ual assessment. For example, portfolio-oriented credit risk models cannot be usedbecause they do not aim to measure individ-ual credit risks but rather the effect of theserisks in relation to a given formation of assets,such as the assets side of a balance sheet.

63Methods based on market data4or external
ratings do not meet the requirements of theBundesbank. The methodology used wouldmean the virtual exclusion of nearly all smalland medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sinceSMEs do not have an external rating and arenot listed on the stock exchange – and the as-sociated market data are therefore unavail-able. From the central bank’s perspective, thiswould mean ruling out – owing to the chosenmethod – collateral assets which do indeedmeet strict requirements.
However, models based on annual accounts
data are, by their very nature, suitable for theBundesbank’s purposes because such dataare widely available for the enterprises whichare to be assessed. The aim is to arrive at abinary assessment, ie either yes or no. Differ-entiating between more than two rating
classes, modelling credit risk changes (ratingmigrations) or analytical modelling of satisfac-tion quotients in the event of insolvencywould go beyond the scope of assessing bor-rowers’ eligibility as it is practised at present.
The (balance-sheet-based) credit risk assess-
ment methods which are of relevance to theBundesbank are essentially confined to para-metric models. The approaches in questionare characterised by the fact that more than

64one factor is established on the basis of avail-
able variables (such as coefficients) from asample and quantified assuming a distribu-tion function. If necessary, they can be sup-plemented by elements of non-parametricapproaches which do not depend on theavailability of a frequency distribution of agiven mathematical form for their application.
The widely used parametric approach of dis-
criminant analysis, which the Bundesbank hasbeen using since the early 1970s, divides bor-rowers into two risk categories (eg high orlow default risk) with the cut-off point beingdetermined by the underlying overall ratio(Z score). In this model, the probabilities ofdefault are established ex post by means of
backtesting.
In respect of assessing a large number of en-
terprises with regard to their eligibility, para-metric methods, such as logit and probitmodels,
5do produce comparable results. In
contrast to discriminant analysis, which pos-tulates a linear connection between the de-pendent and explanatory variables and sup-plies a credit rating index, logit/probit models

also make it possible to estimate a probabilityof default which can be translated into a dif-ferentiating rating scale. This also providessome possibilities for improving the method-ology, which are currently being studied, notleast in view of new requirements in connec-tion with the introduction of the single list.
Non-parametric methods, such as neuronal
networks and expert systems,
7are appropri-
ate mainly for including “soft “qualitativefactors. Even though these models can pro-cess a large amount and variety of data, the
results are verifiable only to a limited extent,not very consistent and difficult to interpret.
An obvious pragmatic middle course is a
combination of parametric and non-parametric elements, such as in the Bundes-bank model with the use of an expert systemdownstream of the discriminant analysis.There is an advantage in combining bothmethods because they retain the transpar-ency of the parametric methods and enhanceflexibility by incorporating “imprecise” infor-mation, thereby improving the “hit accuracy”of the method.
The Bundesbank monitors theoretical devel-
opments in order to continuously assess andimprove the quality of the method it uses.

This is done through an ongoing exchange ofinformation and expertise with various insti-tutions. For instance, the practical implemen-tation of a logit approach for Eurosystem pur-

6Probit and logit methods represent non-linear regres-
sion models (ie non-linear in the parameters) for explain-
ing either-or variables. As a rule, probit and logit regres-
sions are estimated using a method which maximises the
probability that the unknown coefficients would have
produced precisely the distribution function to be mod-
elled. While the cumulative standard normal distribution
supplies the non-linear relationship in the probit ap-
proach, the estimate in the logit method is based on the
cumulative standard logistical function.
7If it is a matter of a combination of a discrete and con-
tinuous distribution of the variables to be explained, the
model developed in 1958 by James Tobin and named
after him (Tobit model) can, of course, also be used.

the European Committee of Central BalanceSheet Data Offices. The Bundesbank hasbeen represented on this European commit-tee consisting of experts from European cen-tral banks and statistics institutions since theend of the 1980s. One of the committee’skey tasks is to look into the methods andworkings of the credit risk assessmentmethods applied by the national centralbanks within the context of the standard re-quirements of the Eurosystem. Additionally,the incorporation of non-linear approaches tothe optimisation of discriminant functions isbeing investigated in cooperation with uni-versity institutions.
Corporate data relevant
to creditworthiness
The data relevant to creditworthiness for the
model-based processing from the annual ac-counts documentation are captured by theresponsible Bundesbank regional offices orbranches and adopted largely unchanged.However, various adjustments to the equityare taken into consideration, a step whichsometimes has a considerable influence onthe standardised credit assessment.
Not only quantitative data but also qualitative
data on the enterprises are collected withparticular attention being paid to accountingpractices. This is because the analysis of thepermissible valuation options pursuant to theGerman Commercial Code may change theinformative value of the acquired quantitativeannual accounts data. Guidance on this maybe gained, for example, from the annex to
the annual report pursuant to section 284 ofthe Commercial Code or from talks with themanagement. Factors that come into consid-eration are the amounts reported for provi-sions and the valuation of balance sheetitems as a function of the incorporated pro-duction costs and the depreciations andwritedowns that have been made. Additionalpoints to consider are other determinantssuch as significant transactions in extraordin-ary income or the use of sale and lease backtransactions. These factors are incorporatedwith varying weights in line with the import-ance of the accounting policy measures. Ap-plication thresholds are also applied to deter-mine whether the measures in question areof significance in terms of their amount.When combined, a numerically expressedevaluation of the accounting practices is pro-duced. These are deemed to be neutral if anenterprise exercises the options like the ma-jority of the enterprises under assessment.Otherwise, given a profit-reducing account-ing policy, they are to be rated as conservativeand, given a profit-boosting accounting pol-icy, as progressive. The result of this is that,after the discriminant analysis, the credit-worthiness index is raised or lowered accord-ingly. The transition points in the evaluationof these three forms of behaviour are fluid.

66vant question is whether an enterprise gener-
ates financial resources on a scale sufficientto regard the default risk of a business loanpledged to the Bundesbank as being verysmall. For such a payment-oriented analysis, afunds statement is an obvious choice. Sincethe maximum residual maturity of thepledged loans is two years and that of thetrade bill is six months, the focus is on the as-sessment of insolvency over the mediumterm.
The system transposes the captured data into
a funds statement. This shows the net re-ceipts, ie the resources available from on-going business activity (cash flow). The cashflow is available to the enterprise to financeinvestment, distribute profits, repay debts orraise the stock of liquid funds. The fundsstatement indicates how an enterprise usesthe cash flow or how it covers excess expend-iture. The financial transactions are brokendown by short-term and long-term borrowedfunds and own funds. As an overall view, thefunds statement reflects a structured andcompressed picture of the financial flows aris-ing from turnover, investment and financingprocesses.
A series of individual ratios is calculated from
the data to assess major financial featuresand to improve the comparability of one en-terprise with another. In order to take ac-count of sector-specific features, each enter-prise is assigned to an economic sector ac-cording to its main line of business using theFederal Statistical Office methodology andthe enterprise’s ratios are shown with thequartile of the relevant sector. A subdivisioninto a maximum of three turnover size cat-
egories enhances comparability. If ratios areavailable for a number of years, there may besome indications of how an enterprise hasperformed in its market and/or competitiveenvironment.
Among the large number of financial ratios,
interest is centred on those which haveproven to be especially well suited to assess-ing insolvency, ie those which are character-ised by a high degree of discriminatory powerin distinguishing enterprises as either “eli-gible” or “ineligible”. Principally, these arethe liquidity, financing and profitability ratios.
– The cash flow is the key variable for as-
sessing the ability to generate disposablefunds from operating activities. As an ex-pression of internal financing capacity, it isincorporated into the calculation of threeratios: the cash flow ratio shows the per-centage of turnover that remains at thefuture disposal of the enterprise. Debt re-payment capability is a yardstick for theability to repay debts from internally gen-erated inflows of funds. The capital recov-ery rate states which part of restrictedassets has become available againthrough the turnover process. Informationon the liquidity conditions is also providedby receivables and payables turnover,which expresses debtors and creditorsarising from trade as a ratio of the operat-ing receipts. High figures in the receivablesratio signify a matching binding of liquid-ity. Payables ratio data that depart strik-ingly upward on an inter-company com-parison indicate an unusual use of times

67allowed for payments, ie possible liquidity
problems.
– A key variable of the financing structure is
modelled by the capital or own fundsratio (own funds as capital plus long-termproprietors’ or partners’ loans). This is oneof the crucial variables for assessing theability to sustain risk and therefore alsohas an impact, in particular, on the possi-bilities of access to borrowing from com-mercial banks.
– Profitability is assessed on the basis of the
return on turnover (before tax) and theoperational return is the outcome of theactual business activity.
Eligible enterprises are generally characterised
by a sufficiently large inflow of liquid fundsfrom operational business, a very sound pro-vision with own funds and adequate profit-ability. The results for the individual ratios dodisplay a considerable range but eligible en-terprises can offset a weakness in the case ofone ratio with strengths in the case of others.In other words, there is no rigid pattern withregard to a list of demands for each particularratio. This is illustrated by way of an examplein the chart on page 68 using the ratios forthree eligible enterprises.
Enterprise A represents an eligible enterprise
with largely balanced ratios and neutral ac-counting, corresponding roughly to the nor-mal case. By contrast, the individual ratios ofenterprises B and C present a more heteroge-neous picture with regard to their credit-worthiness information. For example, enter-prise B more than compensates for its below-
average return and its obviously weaker li-quidity with its well above-average ownfunds ratio and more conservative account-ing. In the case of enterprise C, the outstand-ing return and good liquidity offset the nega-tive feature of progressive accounting, thefairly low provision with own funds and theweaker accounts receivable ratio. On thewhole, the enterprises shown with their dif-fering ratios display a comparable viability interms of the Bundesbank’s analysis. This ap-proach, which departs from a rigid template,shows that the calculated creditworthinessindex takes account of the many different de-terminants and is able to model the relevantcompensation possibilities. The key factor forthe credit assessment is, therefore, the overallpicture presented by the financial circum-stances, as is reflected by the overall ratiowhich is determined on the basis of themodel.
Model-based classification proposalThe model-based analysis of the data is per-
formed in two stages. The purpose of a dis-criminant function is to calculate an overallratio for each enterprise, which provides aninitial indication of an enterprise’s credit-worthiness (see notes on the methodologyon page 70). The individual ratios are separ-ated into three sectors (manufacturing, tradeand other enterprises) and the ratios whichhave proved to be especially suited to classify-ing creditworthiness with regard to theirplausibility and in statistical tests are pro-cessed in discriminant functions. The overallratio is calculated from the aggregate weight-

68ed individual ratios including the scaled ac-
counting practices. If the overall ratio is abovea discriminatory cut-off point, this providesan initial indication of the eligibility of the en-terprise in question for central bank finan-cing. The further the overall ratio lies abovethis minimum level, the more creditworthythe enterprise is generally likely to be. Thefurther the overall ratio lies below the min-imum level, the greater is the risk of default.
To improve the accuracy of the system, an ex-
pert system is used downstream of the dis-criminant analysis (see explanatory notes onthe methodology on p 70). Applying fixedrules, the expert system subjects a wealth ofdata to in-depth analysis. The data analysedare primarily financial information, but theyalso incorporate the legal form, the size andthe age of an enterprise. The set of rules is
divided into three parts. This means that al-most 40 rules are applied separately to theenterprises combined in each of the manu-facturing, trade and “other” groups. As a re-sult, the expert system sets the value bywhich the overall ratio calculated by the dis-criminant function is to be changed. Fromthis, it derives the classification proposal of“eligible” or “ineligible”.
In principle, subdivision into more than these
two creditworthiness categories would bepossible with the overall ratio as a measure ofcreditworthiness and would not require a sig-nificant workload. This is currently underexamination but not being practised. The pri-mary aim is to classify the enterprises in termsof their eligibility for central bank refinancing.

69This specific objective is what, first and fore-
most, differentiates the Bundesbank’s creditassessment system from those used by thecredit institutions and rating agencies. Thelatter classify quality mainly to frame termsand conditions that are appropriate to therisk involved, and that requires a multi-stagecredit rating. In the long term, however, asubdivision into several rating categorieswould make sense for the Bundesbank. Thiswould allow a better comparison with thecredit assessment methods used by othercentral banks or other rating sources.

The enterprises classified as eligible display ahigh standard of creditworthiness. They gen-erally prove to be quite “cyclically robust”, iethey are largely in the “eligible” range evenin difficult cyclical circumstances. It is possibleto note migration patterns especially in thecase of enterprises which have an overallratio calculated by the expert system thatmoves nearer to the minimum level definedas eligible. In this threshold range, evenminor fluctuations in the figures of the annualaccounts may lead to a change in the classifi-cation proposal determined by the method.
However, if an enterprise’s overall ratio fluctu-
ates over the cycle in the upper eligiblerange, there will generally be no resultingchange in the classification; the enterprise isstill classified as eligible. The relative size ofthe determined creditworthiness index istherefore crucial in terms of the risk of down-grading.
Anex post analysis reveals that, of the enter-
prises classified as eligible under the currentversion of the method on the basis of their
annual accounts for 1999, almost three-quarters achieve the same rating on the basisof the annual accounts for 2002 as well.
Decision on eligibilityThe classification proposal has a large binding
effect for the credit assessment to be set atthe end of the procedure. Even so, the bodieswith responsibility locally at the regional of-fices and branches take the decision on thefinal credit assessment. This is designed to en-sure that facts which are of relevance tocreditworthiness and cannot be taken intoaccount in model-based processing are givenindividual consideration. Such facts may re-late to developments after the close of theannual accounts, the assessment of the dur-ability of changes in major items of the bal-ance sheet or profit and loss account, the in-clusion of the credit standing of affiliated en-terprises (group accounts) or particularsector-specific features of an enterprise,which cannot be given adequate consider-ation in the model. Furthermore, contactwith the enterprises means that notablechanges in market position or in the manage-ment can be incorporated. The sum of thiskind of information that can be used to forman overall picture may result in the credit as-sessment deviating from the classificationproposal produced by the system.

70Model-based part of the credit risk assessment method
The discriminant analysis and expert system
serve the purpose of modelling an enterprise’screditworthiness in a single number. The discrim-inant function combines individual ratios intoan overall ratio, the expert system changes theoverall ratio after processing further data rele-vant to creditworthiness and the resulting over-all ratio is produced as the outcome of thestandardised part of the credit risk assessmentmethod.
Discriminant analysisDiscriminant analysis is a statistical method
which can be used to select from the large num-ber of commonly used corporate ratios the cor-porate ratios which are significant with respectto the risk assessment, to weight them and tocombine them into a single ratio for each enter-prise. For this purpose, a sample with twogroups of enterprises is formed. These contrastin terms of their creditworthiness: one is solventand one is already insolvent. On the basis ofthese data, a (linear) discriminant function isdetermined with those individual ratios whichclassify these enterprises as accurately as possiblein terms of their creditworthiness. To which ofthe two groups an enterprise belongs is decidedby a comparison of the enterprise’s overall ratiowith an overall ratio that separates solvent frominsolvent enterprises. If the overall ratio of anenterprise lies above this cut-off point, it is to beassigned to the group of enterprises which, witha high degree of probability, are solvent. Other-wise, it is assigned to the group which is lessmarkedly solvent. In the discriminant analysis,the parameters of the discriminant functioncan be defined so that the classification errors– (I) acceptance of an insolvent party or (II) rejec-tion of a solvent party – are minimised.
Accurate classification and discriminatory power
are vital to the efficiency of the discriminantfunction. Classification errors may occur in eitherdirection although naturally the error of classify-ing insolvent enterprises as solvent should be assmall as possible. Discriminatory power is gearedto the following criterion: an enterprise shouldbe grouped all the more readily with the solvent
or insolvent enterprises, the further its overallratio is above or below the cut-off point in ei-ther case. Statistical tests confirm the suitabilityof discriminant analysis for the credit riskassessment procedure. Nevertheless, the resultscan still be improved by employing an expertsystem.
Expert systemThe expert system allows corporate features not
(directly) taken into account in the discriminantfunction to be used for the risk assessment. Fur-thermore, depending on the criteria, the dataare studied from a static or dynamic angle. Theexpert system determines by how much theoverall ratio produced by the discriminant func-tion is to be changed. Above all, the use of theexpert system is particularly important whereverenterprises with an overall ratio close to the cut-off point are to be assigned to the eligible or in-eligible group.
The expert system is an artificial intelligence
method. It assesses corporate features usingrules in the form of if-then relationships. An ex-ample of such a relationship is: “If overall per-formance remains more or less the same and thereturn on turnover rises, then the overall ratiowill rise”. So that the system can compare a rulewith the relevant numerical feature value of anenterprise, the feature value likewise has to beverbalised. The feature value is characterisedusing a so-called inclusion function, say, by oneof the characteristics “risen – roughly identical –fallen”. The inclusion function also determinesthe degree to which the relevant characteristic ispresent. The degree to which a characteristic ismet and the weight of the relevant rule deter-mine their impact on the change in the overallratio. The values of the relevant rules are com-bined in such a way that the overall ratio fromthe discriminant analysis does not increase or de-crease by more than one set value for any enter-prise. This is done to avoid “watering down” thediscriminant analytical core of the method.

therefore possible only for good reasons.
On grounds of confidentiality, the relevant re-
gional office or branch informs only the as-sessed enterprise of the credit assessment, ie“eligible” or “ineligible”, and, upon request,the credit institution that wishes to use thebusiness loan as collateral. The bodies withlocal responsibility are available to the enter-prise to explain the credit assessment andmake it easier for them to understand. If re-quested, they will prepare an analytical over-view showing how the corporate data havebeen converted into the financial statementand into individual ratios. The overview alsocontains a cross-comparison of individualratios with enterprises in the same sector andof a similar size. The size of the overall ratioprovides an indication of how secure eligibil-ity is.

The Bundesbank’s credit assessment providesthe enterprises with an independent outsideevaluation of their economic circumstancesand, if applicable, the credit classification “eli-gible”. This may prove to be useful in theirbusiness dealings with credit institutions andother enterprises.
In terms of using the credit assessment as a
basis for a decision on accepting collateral ornot, a more differentiated scale of credit-worthiness is, of course, superfluous. Never-theless, the lack of such a differentiation – es-
pecially in the case of enterprises not classi-fied as eligible – may raise questions about in-formation on the enterprise’s own credit-worthiness. In actual fact, the range of credit-worthiness in the case of ineligible enterprisesis very broad. Owing to the fact that thecredit standards for eligibility are very de-manding in themselves, this is only to be ex-pected and by no means implies that thereare serious doubts about the viability of en-terprises which are not given this certifica-tion. In the case of many of these enterprises,it may be assumed that they have orderlycredit relations with their banks and are,therefore, creditworthy. Depending on theircreditworthiness, the enterprises may postcollateral as backing for the lending bank. Bycontrast, in a procedure involving the centralbank – where the credit relationship is be-tween the central bank and the commercialbank – there exists no safeguard other thanthe undoubted creditworthiness of the collat-eral asset that is the business loan. At most,an enterprise that is ineligible owing to itsown economic circumstances can be up-graded only by means of a guarantee givenby an eligible counterparty.
Critical issues with regard to eligibility for cen-
tral bank refinancing can best be settled intalks between the enterprise and the respon-sible regional office or branch. The Bundes-bank places particular value on such an ex-change since – as indicated – not only the fig-ures in the annual accounts but also the indi-

73New capital
requirements for
credit institutions
(Basel II)Basel II is the most significant change
in prudential supervisory legislationsince the late 1980s. On 26 June 2004,the central bank governors of theGroup of Ten (G10) and the heads ofthe supervisory authorities in thesecountries endorsed the publication ofthe “International Convergence of Cap-ital Measurement and Capital Stand-ards: a Revised Framework (Basel II)”.After more than five years of discus-sions, this marks a significant milestonein the international harmonisation ofprudential supervisory legislation.
The key objective of the new Frame-
work is to adjust banks’ capital require-ments more closely to the actually in-curred risk than in the past and to takeaccount of recent innovations in the fi-nancial markets as well as in institu-tions’ risk management strategies. Add-itional focal points of the new Frame-work are basic principles for qualitativebanking supervision and the expansionof disclosure requirements in order toenhance market discipline.
In parallel to the work by the Basel
Committee, on 14 July 2004 the Euro-pean Commission presented proposalsfor Directives to transpose the Baselproposals into European law; the de-liberations in the Ecofin Council andthe European Parliament are to becompleted by the end of this year, ifpossible.

74Objectives of the revised capital rules
The international capital rules for banks, the
Basel Capital Accord of 1988 (Basel I), werealready criticised in the mid-1990s. The keyreason for this was the supervisory guidelinethat capital requirements be calculated forcredit risk in a relatively undifferentiated man-ner, which often only insufficiently portrayedthe actual risk. In addition, this regulatoryframework virtually neglected more innova-tive financial instruments and credit risk man-agement methods. Furthermore, the orienta-tion of the capital requirements solely tocredit and market risks does not correspondto a bank’s actual risk profile.
Basel II is intended to remedy these flaws as
much as possible. Supervisors’ risk measure-ment practices will converge more closely tobanks’ risk management methods. The rangeand the level of development of the appliedrisk measurement procedures vary widelyfrom bank to bank, however. Basel II ad-dresses this phenomenon through an evolu-tionary concept of approaches of varying de-grees of refinement: for the three key riskareas – credit risk, market risk and operation-al risk – credit institutions will, in future, beable to choose between standardised meas-urement concepts and more refined internalprocedures and models. The more refined riskmeasurement procedures will lead to capitalrelief.
Moreover, supervisors’ experience has shown
that capital requirements – despite their use-fulness as a buffer for losses and as risk limita-tion standards – are in themselves notenough to guarantee the solvency of a bank.
The Basel Committee has therefore added in-tensified qualitative banking supervision tothe minimum capital requirements (Pillar 2).For Germany this will mean, among otherthings, an extension of “on-site” audits,which will be conducted mainly by the Bun-desbank. The decisive factor is to identify andadequately supervise the overall risk to an in-stitution and the key factors influencing itsrisk situation. In addition, banks are to besubject to more comprehensive disclosure re-quirements so as to make use of the disciplin-ing forces of the markets as a complement tothe regulatory requirements (Pillar 3).
Pillar 1: Minimum capital requirements
The quantitative capital requirements, which
are the product of procedures of varyingcomplexity for measuring the relevant risks,are at the heart of the new Basel Framework.
Standardised Approach for credit riskIn the Standardised Approach for measuring
credit risks, the risk weights applied to claimson sovereigns, banks and corporates (includ-ing insurance companies) depend on the as-sessments made by external credit assess-ment institutions recognised by supervisors.

7550%, 100% or 150%. Unrated claims are
given a 100% risk weight.2
In the case of claims on banks, the approachof determining the risk weight depending onthe banks’ external rating is set out under“option 2”. An alternative, however, is alsoto derive the risk weight for a bank from theexternal rating of the sovereign of the coun-try in which the bank is incorporated(option 1). In this case, claims on banks aregenerally risk-weighted one category lessfavourable than claims on the sovereign. Thisoption is particularly attractive for small andmedium-sized banks, as their low rating cov-erage could otherwise have a negative impacton their refinancing opportunities. As in thepast, banks domiciled in Germany are as-signed a 20% risk weight.
For claims on corporates, too, the new
Framework will not bring any major changeswith regard to the capital requirement relativeto current treatment, because unrated claimswill still be given a 100% risk weighting. Atpresent, fewer than 100 corporates in Ger-many have had an assessment published by arating agency.
An innovative development is the “regulatory
retail portfolio”, which includes not onlyclaims on individuals but also exposures tosmall businesses. Additional classification cri-teria include the type of exposure (eg revolv-ing credits, personal term loans etc) and theamount of the aggregate retail exposure to asingle borrower of up to 31 million. The uni-
form risk weight in this category is 75%; thisrepresents a significant reduction in the cap-ital requirement for retail exposures. In all
likelihood, a considerable percentage of allGerman entities’ borrowing can be assignedto the regulatory retail portfolio.
The risk weight for claims secured by liens on
property occupied or rented by the borrowerwas reduced from 50% to 35%. For claimssecured by commercial real estate, a riskweight of 50% is possible if certain additionalqualitative requirements are met. The EC Dir-ective defines the classification criteria forthese categories of claims somewhat morebroadly than the Basel Framework.

76150% risk weight is also applied to the un-
secured and unprovisioned part of loans thatare past due for more than 90 days. Nationalsupervisors may reduce the risk weight as fol-lows if the specific provisions exceed a certainpercentage of the outstanding amount of theloan: to 100% if the specific provisions arehigher than 20% of the outstanding amountof the loan and to 50% if the specific provi-sions are higher than 50% of the outstandingamount of the loan.
Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach to
measuring credit risk
Basel II will give credit institutions the option
of using internal methods to calculate regula-tory capital requirements for credit risk forthe first time. However, internal credit riskmodels that take account of portfolio diversi-fication and correlation effects will not yet beapproved by supervisors. Rather, the min-imum capital requirement will generally becalculated on the basis of individual expos-ures and will, in future, result from supervis-ory risk weight functions. Depending on theapproach used (Foundation IRB Approach orAdvanced IRB Approach), the inputs will beeither partly prescribed by supervisors or esti-mated wholly by banks.
Credit institutions need supervisory approval
to be able to calculate regulatory capital re-quirements using their own rating systems;this approval can be granted by supervisorsupon application by the institution and basedon an on-site audit. It is up to the institutionto decide whether or not to use internal rat-ings. Following an initial survey in the sum-mer of 2003, the German supervisory author-
ities assume that up to 800 institutions willapply for permission to use the IRB Approach.An additional survey in the autumn of 2004will provide more definite figures.
As in the Standardised Approach for calculat-
ing the capital requirement for credit risk, theIRB Approach also defines different assetclasses for regulatory purposes. The chart onpage 77 shows how credit risk assets are sub-divided into asset classes.
Corporate and retail exposures are subdivided
into four and three sub-classes respectively, towhich different risk weights are applied. Themethods of defining retail exposures accord-ing to Basel and the EU differ in the details,however. The Basel Framework directly de-fines three sub-classes of retail exposures. Bycontrast, the EC Directive initially defines theretail exposure class as all exposures to indi-vidual persons and to small and medium-sized entities up to a (total) amount of 31 mil-
lion, which are similar to retail exposures forrisk management purposes. The three sub-classes are defined only in the second step.
– Residential mortgage loans comprise all
retail exposures secured on property bymeans of a mortgage or land charge.
– Revolving credits are all revolving, un-
secured exposures to individuals that areuncommitted and unconditionally cancell-able involving a loan amount of under3100,000.

77– Other retail exposures include all other
loans to individual persons and loans toentities in the retail category and not se-cured by land charges or mortgages.
Owing to the two-tiered definition of asset
classes within the retail portfolio, there areslight differences between the Basel andBrussels rules. For example, the Basel rulesclassify loans to small entities secured by landcharges on commercial real estate as “otherretail exposures” since the Basel definition ofresidential mortgage loans refers only toloans for residential real estate. In the Brusselscontext, by contrast, the sample loan men-tioned above would be classified as a residen-tial mortgage loan. As things now stand, theresulting differences in capital requirementswould appear to be slight. The EC Directive’sdefinitional criteria will therefore probably be
the sole basis for transposing Basel II intonational law.
The capital requirement in the IRB Approach
is determined – apart from a constant factorof 8% – as the product of exposure at default(EAD) and the result of the risk weight func-tion, which hinges on the following risk par-ameters: probability of default (PD), lossgiven default (LGD) and effective maturity(M). Within the IRB Approach, credit institu-tions may choose between two stages whichdiffer in terms of the parameters to be esti-mated internally and the minimum require-ments.

78for borrowers. LGD and EAD are determined
by supervisors and depend on the type ofproduct and on the collateral posted. Theweighting of collateral in the Foundation IRBApproach largely follows the rules of theStandardised Approach. The maturity of ex-posures to corporates, banks and sovereignsis generally set at 2.5 years. At national dis-cretion, however, the inclusion of effectivematurity may also be laid down.
In the Advanced IRB Approach, however,
credit institutions estimate all four risk param-eters (PD, LGD, EAD and M) themselves. Therisk weight for exposures to corporates,banks and sovereigns generally depends oneffective maturity. At national discretion, auniform maturity of 2.5 years can be assignedto exposures to corporates with annual re-ported sales and total assets of up to 3500
million.
The evolutionary structure of the Basel capital
requirements evident in the two-stage make-up gives credit institutions the opportunity ofgradually refining their risk measurementsystems towards the more advanced ap-proaches. Smaller institutions, for which ownestimates of LGD and EAD would be overlyambitious from a cost-benefit point of view,can use the Foundation IRB Approach on apermanent basis. The results of the summer2003 survey also show just how importantthe role of the Foundation IRB Approach is: ofthe 800 candidates that are likely to use theIRB Approach, only around 30 intend to applythe Advanced IRB Approach.Credit institutions can gain an idea of “aver-
age” or “expected” annual losses in creditbusiness on the basis of historical default andloss data. Expected loss (EL) is a calculablecost component of credit business, whichought to be covered by provisions and inter-est margins. Regulatory capital should there-fore be held in reserve only for unexpecteddeviations from expected losses, also knownas unexpected losses (UL). These deviationsmay potentially be large but occur relativelyinfrequently. A typical example of this is whennumerous borrowers default simultaneouslyin a year, such as during a recession. The ULcalibration also corresponds to the way banksdetermine their economic capital.
Based on the comments regarding the third
consultative paper (CP3), the Basel Commit-tee recalibrated the risk weights for claims inthe IRB Approach, thereby following the ULconcept. The new risk weights are presentedin a technical annex to this article along withfurther theoretical information on UL calibra-tion.
The UL calibration in the IRB Approach en-
tailed two major consequences. Firstly, creditinstitutions now have to show that they – inline with the above considerations – have ac-tually set aside sufficient provisions to coverEL. Insufficient coverage of EL will lead to adeduction of capital equal to the margin ofthe shortfall. If credit institutions set asidemore provisions than necessary based ontheir EL calculations, the surpluses may berecognised as additional capital up to a cer-tain level.

79Secondly, UL calibration means that capital
no longer has to be maintained in reserve fordefaulted loans. The reason for this lies in theBasel risk model, in which LGD is entered as arisk-free constant. In reality, however, default-ed loans are fraught with risk since the actualrecoverable amounts are uncertain. Defaultedloans should therefore be given capital back-ing which also maps, in particular, adverseeconomic influences on the recovery rate.
The following solution was found: credit insti-
tutions should no longer orient their internalLGD estimates to historical default-weightedaverage LGDs but to conservative scenariosof the business cycle. Credit institutions are toestimate a “downturn LGD” containing prob-able losses during an economic downturn.For defaulted loans, there is now a capitalcharge consisting of the difference betweenthe conservative downturn LGD and the pro-vision conditioned by the current economicsituation.
The technical details and models explaining
the theories underlying both consequences ofthe EL-UL decisions are explained in the tech-nical annex.
Downturn LGD is still a relatively unknown
concept in internal risk management. Super-visors will therefore work together withbanks to develop suitable methods for calcu-lating downturn LGDs internally. In addition,it is to be established on which national mar-kets and for which types of assets and collat-eral average LGD and downturn LGD differsignificantly from one another. For classes ofmarkets, assets and collateral without a sig-nificant difference, it will remain possible
to use expected default-weighted averageLGDs.
As already mentioned earlier, institutions will
need supervisory approval before they canapply the IRB Approach. It can be granted toinstitutions upon application and followingan on-site audit. This audit looks at compli-ance with minimum qualitative and quantita-tive requirements. These minimum require-ments are aimed firstly at ensuring the reli-ability of banks’ internal estimates of the PD,LGD and EAD risk parameters and thus cap-ital adequacy. Examples of such requirementsinclude the implementation of a uniform def-inition of default prescribed by Basel andBrussels or the validation of estimated riskparameters, for example, by comparing themwith actual defaults and losses.
Secondly, the minimum requirements are in-
tended to ensure that banks’ internal ratingsystems are actually used for their respectiveinstitutions’ risk management. An example ofthis is the use of rating information to setlimits and define responsibilities in manage-ment information systems and to calculaterisk-appropriate capital charges.
The minimum requirements have not
changed much since the second Basel andBrussels consultative papers. They were al-ready described in detail in a Monthly Report
article published in January 2003.

80frame. Permanent freedom of choice be-
tween the Standardised Approach and theIRB Approach for asset classes would poten-tially lead to “cherry-picking” between thetwo approaches, with institutions beingtempted to choose the approach holding outthe promise of a lower capital charge. In boththe Basel Framework and the draft EC Direct-ive, therefore, permanent use of the Stand-ardised Approach is, in principle, permittedonly for portfolios with a non-material (mean-ing insignificant) volume and risk content.The Commission’s proposed Directive, how-ever, goes even further. For example, accord-ing to the envisaged EC rules, institutions willbe able to permanently remove exposures tocentral governments and subordinate levelsof government of the home country (regionaland local government) from the IRB Ap-proach. In addition, smaller credit institutionswill also be allowed to leave exposures toother banks in the Standardised Approach ona permanent basis. In smaller institutions, thisportfolio may be significant in terms of vol-ume and risk; in many cases, however, it willcontain only a few material counterparties,which would make the development of a rat-ing system unduly burdensome. This is not anoption for major and especially internationallyactive institutions.
Initial discussions with the banking industry
have revealed that both EAD and risk-weighted assets (RWA) should be used as anassessment basis for the transitional partialuse of the IRB Approach during the nationalimplementation process. Institutions shouldbe allowed to use the IRB Approach if at least50% of their credit exposure – expressed asEAD – and 50% of their credit risk – ex-
pressed as RWA – are valued using internalratings approved by supervisors. With regardto permanent partial use for a remainder(“exit threshold” from the transition period),opinions still differ; the banking industry’sproposals range between 3% and 20% ofEAD/RWA which should be kept in the Stand-ardised Approach permanently. The Germansupervisory authorities are currently in favourof a range between 5% and 8%.
Credit risk mitigation techniquesIn future, credit risk mitigation methods
3
used in banking practice should be given
greater supervisory recognition than in thepast. For example, in future, collateral that istypical of medium-sized entities such asreceivables and physical collateral can be em-ployed to reduce the capital charge. Thechart on page 81 gives an outline of eligiblecollateral in the individual credit risk mitiga-tion approaches.
There are two approaches which banks may
use to determine the risk weight for financialcollateral. Under the simple approach, theborrower’s risk weight is replaced by the riskweight of the collateral for the secured partof the exposure. Under the comprehensiveapproach,
4the amount of the exposure is re-

81through the application of “haircuts”. These
haircuts depend on factors such as the typeof collateral, the assumed holding period ofthe underlying transaction and the frequencyof revaluation. Banks may use supervisoryhaircuts but also have the option of makingtheir own estimates of haircuts.
5
For repo-style transactions falling under a bi-lateral netting agreement with a counter-party, banks will, in future, be allowed tomake their own estimates of value at risk(VaR) in place of the comprehensive ap-proach. This is predicated on supervisory ap-proval of the VaR model to be used. Studieshave shown that this significantly reduces thecapital requirements for this type of transac-tion.
In the Foundation IRB Approach, collateral is
recognised through reducing LGD. For eligiblefinancial collateral, the LGD for the securedpart of the exposure is reduced to 0%. Theadjusted value of the collateral is determinedaccording to the rules of the StandardisedApproach. For other collateral – in compari-son with the third consultative paper – LGD isreduced to 35% (for receivables and real es-tate collateral) or 40% (for other collateral).For these types of collateral, an additionalovercollateralisation of 125% (receivables) or140% (real estate and other collateral) isrequired.
Warranties
6and credit derivatives are risk-
weighted – as in the past – by assigning the(lower) risk weight of the guarantor to thesecured part of the loan (substitution ap-proach). The range of eligible guarantors hasbeen expanded to include, in future, all sover-
eigns and banks with a lower risk weightthan the borrower as well as non-banks as ofa minimum rating of A- (or with a certainmaximum PD in the Foundation IRB Ap-proach). In addition, certain governmentcounter-guarantees will now also be recog-nised.
Another new aspect is that collateral and
warranties will be recognised as mitigatingrisk even if there is a maturity mismatch be-tween the underlying exposure and the col-lateral instrument. The extent of the risk miti-gation thus depends on the ratio of theDeutsche BundesbankEligible collateral

Securitisation exposuresThe securitisation of assets is one of the most
rapidly growing business lines of German andinternational banks. At the same time, it is ahighly complex field. The new Basel Frame-work will, for the first time, create an inter-nationally harmonised standard for the super-visory treatment of these transactions. Thiswill significantly reduce the incentive for cap-ital arbitrage, which was a key motive for thesecuritisation of claims in the past, and riskmanagement and refinancing aspects willassume a more prominent role.
For a bank that securitises its own assets (ori-
ginator), capital relief is contingent on an ef-fective and significant risk transfer. There areno explicit limits on the volume of securitisa-tion exposures that the originator may retain– except for the significant risk transfer ex-posure. This creates the necessary flexibilityfor a regulatory interpretation based on theeconomic impact of a transaction. The oper-ational requirements for supervisory recogni-tion of risk transfer are identical for securitisa-tion exposures in the Standardised Approachand the IRB Approach. A distinction is madewith regard to the capital charge on securi-tisation exposures held by originators or in-vestors in order to take due account of thedifferent degrees of knowledge and experi-ence of risk management at the individualinstitutions.The Standardised Approach for securitisation
exposures is generally modelled on the sys-tem used in the general Standardised Ap-proach for credit risk. However, for trancheswith an external rating of less than Baa3,higher risk weights are applied, and, for un-rated positions as a matter of principle, a de-duction of capital (evenly split between corecapital and additional capital) is required. Thismore conservative approach takes account ofthe high concentration of risk in subordinatesecuritisation exposures and avoids creatingthe incentive to explicitly forgo an externalrating for tranches with poorer credit ratings.
The IRB Approach for securitisation exposures
deviates from the general credit risk backingrules in the IRB Approach since no internal es-timates of tranche-specific PDs, LGDs etc aretaken into account. Accordingly, no distinc-tion is made between a Foundation and anAdvanced Approach for securitisation expos-ures. There are three ways to calculate thecapital requirement for a securitisation expos-ure: the external Ratings-Based Approach(RBA), the Supervisory Formula (SF) and theInternal Assessment Approach (IAA), which ispermitted only for a limited scope of applica-tion.
The RBA must be applied to all securitisation
exposures of IRB banks for whose risk assess-ment an external rating exists. A certain riskweight is assigned to each rating category.However, in contrast to the Standardised Ap-proach, the RBA segments rating classesmore finely and has a greater range of riskweights, which also takes account of the se-niority of a tranche and the granularity of the

83underlying pool of exposures. Moreover, the
RBA does not distinguish between originators(directly or indirectly the original holders ofunderlying exposures) and investors.
The SF and IAA may be applied to unrated ex-
posures. Some relief in the calculation of theinputs was envisaged for the use of the SF.This particularly concerns the key determin-ant, the regulatory capital requirement forthe underlying portfolio prior to securitisationplus the EL of the portfolio (K
IRB). K IRBas an
input into the SF may be calculated on an ag-gregate portfolio basis instead of on an indi-vidual borrower basis as in the IRB Approach.
With the IAA, the Basel Committee has per-
mitted the limited use of internal tranche-specific risk assessments, thereby taking intoaccount a market standard which has be-come established practice for asset-backedcommercial paper (ABCP) programmes. TheIAA of the institution in question must bebased on the methodological approaches ofrecognised rating agencies. The bank calcu-lates the capital requirement by assigning itsinternal assessment to the rating scale of arecognised rating agency and risk-weightingthe exposures using the RBA. Supervisory ap-proval is required for the use of the IAA.
The relief in the use of the SF and the intro-
duction of the IAA means that many unratedsecuritisation exposures such as liquidity facil-ities are treated considerably more favourablythan in the third consultative paper. In thismanner, the Basel Committee has attemptedto strike a balance for unrated exposures be-tween conservative treatment and the mostextensive consideration of established bank-
ing practices.
Treatment of operational riskAs is the case for credit risk, there are likewise
three methods of calculating the regulatorycapital charge for operational risk: the BasicIndicator Approach (BIA), the StandardisedApproach (TSA) and the Advanced Measure-ment Approaches (AMA).

The Basel Committee permits the use ofbanks’ own Advanced Measurement Ap-proaches for the calculation of minimumregulatory capital under certain conditionsdespite the lack of an industry standard forcapturing operational risk. Credit institutionsare working hard to develop and refine these
methods. Subject to compliance with super-visory eligibility criteria, banks prefer a varietyof approaches and measurement methods, asthere is currently neither a single “best prac-tice” nor may it be safely assumed that sucha practice will be identified on the basis ofthe banks’ individual risk profiles. This varietywill place high demands on supervisors intheir model approval procedures for AMAs.
The large amount of time and effort needed
to apply an AMA and especially the quantityof data required for calculation, moreover,mean that supervisors are willing to embarkon new paths in cross-border issues, too. Onthat vein, an AMA bank – contingent on theapproval of its responsible home and hostsupervisors – will be allowed to waive the in-dividual calculation of regulatory capital forthe operational risk of insignificant foreignsubsidiaries and opt instead to allocate thecapital calculated using the AMA of thegroup after prior consultation with super-visors. Supervisors expect this to boost thedevelopment of more risk-sensitive allocationmechanisms compared with the procedurescurrently available for measuring operationalrisk capital charges.

Pillar 2: The Supervisory Review Process
(SRP)
The four fundamental principles on which Pil-
lar 2, the Supervisory Review Process (SRP), isbased, have not been changed in the Baseltext since the third consultative paper. Rather,new wording on the implementation of theSRP by national supervisors has been incorp-orated in order to deal with the discretionaryscope implied by the SRP in a transparent andresponsible manner. Moreover, cross-bordercooperation between supervisors will be in-tensified in the interests of the banks.
This aspect is addressed in the “High-level
principles for the cross-border implementa-tion of the New Accord”, likewise publishedby the Basel Committee. Responsibility forthe supervision of a legal entity within abanking group always rests with the nationalsupervisory authority where the legal entity islocated. This national jurisdiction, however, issupplemented by intensive cooperation andexchanges of information between all of theauthorities involved and is coordinated by theauthority responsible for the supervision ofthe group on a consolidated basis.
In order to make further progress in develop-
ing the single European financial market, theEuropean Commission, too, has placed a highpriority on the coordinated cross-border ap-plication of the new rules. Its proposal for a
Directive emphasises a level of convergenceexceeding the Basel Framework and supervis-ory cooperation within the European Eco-nomic Area.
Convergence in the European Economic Area
is to be understood as maximum harmonisa-tion in the transposition of the European Dir-ectives into national law and the convergenceof the application of these rules in supervisorypractice. The Commission’s proposal envis-ages the centralised disclosure of nationalsupervisory regulations and practices to cre-ate transparency and to considerably facilitatethe comparability of supervisory regimesacross countries.
The Commission’s proposal also envisages the
possibility of a group submitting a single ap-plication for the use of IRB and AMA Ap-proaches; as a consequence, the supervisorsof the group’s members would then need tojointly determine
10whether to authorise the
procedure. If this is not accomplished withinsix months, the Commission’s proposal envis-ages determination by the supervisor of theparent company. Whilst this approach isunderstandable in terms of simplifying mat-ters for the groups of institutions in question,the wording gives rise to a host of legal, polit-ical and practical supervisory issues. Thesequestions will play a key role in the EuropeanCouncil and the European Parliament.
10The text of the draft Directive (which is currently avail-
able only in English) uses the term “determination” here
and deliberately avoids “decision”, which would corres-
pond to the national administrative act of deciding on an
application.Basel principles

86The Pillar 2 concept of regulatory capital in
conjunction with the issue of additional regu-latory capital requirements and the doubleproportionality of Pillar 2 were further key as-pects that required special attention in trans-posing the SRP principles of Basel II into aEuropean Directive.
Whereas Basel uniformly uses the term “cap-
ital”, the proposed Directive clearly distin-guishes between “own funds” and “internalcapital”. Generally speaking, own fundscover only the risks according to the Pillar 1supervisory calculation requirements. For thesecond pillar, the proposed Directive goes fur-ther in envisaging that all institutions have in-ternally developed processes to manage theamount of capital they themselves deem ad-equate to support their current and future
risk.
Given the variegated nature of the German
banking system, the double proportionality ofthe second pillar expressly envisaged in theproposed Directive is of major importance.Both the risk management and measurementof internal capital as well as the intensity andfrequency of supervisory review have to beoriented to the size, complexity and risk pro-file of the individual institution and its import-ance for system stability. The system rele-vance is also mandated as a criterion for theintensity and frequency of supervisory review.

ing categories: eligibility reviews for banks’ in-ternal procedures for measuring and man-

87aging market, credit and operational risk; re-
views of ongoing compliance with Pillar 1 re-quirements, and minimum requirements forthe structure and organisation of institutions’risk-relevant operations (see chart on page 86).
Today’s audits of banking operations already
address elements of the future SRP (audits ofinternal market risk models pursuant to sec-tion 7 of Principle I and audits for compliancewith the “Minimum Requirements for theCredit Business of Credit Institutions” and the“Minimum Requirements for the Trading Ac-tivities of Credit Institutions”.
This type of audit will be expanded in order
to do justice to the Pillar 2 supervisory re-quirements. Besides streamlining the existingsupervisory minimum requirements, this is thereason why the Federal Financial SupervisoryAuthority (Bundesanstalt f/C252r Finanzdienstleis-tungsaufsicht, or BaFin) and the DeutscheBundesbank are working to develop “Min-imum Requirements for Risk Management”.The existing “Minimum Requirements for theTrading Activities of Credit Institutions” andthe “Minimum Requirements for the CreditBusiness of Credit Institutions”, as well as the“Minimum Requirements for the InternalAudit Function of Credit Institutions”, are tobe integrated into the “Minimum Require-ments for Risk Management” with as fewchanges as possible. In addition, requirementsfor other aspects of the SRP need to be newlydeveloped, such as requirements for the man-agement of interest rate risk and for internalprocesses for the adequate backing of all keyrisks with internal capital. The advantage ofintegrating the existing minimum require-ments into the “Minimum Requirements for
Risk Management” is that this will create auniform framework of rules. Building on thealready existing minimum requirements, the“Minimum Requirements for Risk Manage-ment” will therefore formulate the qualitativesupervisory requirements for institutions pur-suant to Pillar 2. Once the new rules havetaken effect, reviewing compliance with the“Minimum Requirements for Risk Manage-ment” will be a central element of the Super-visory Review Process.
Pillar 3: Disclosure of risk information
Pillar 3 is intended to enable the complemen-
tary use of market mechanisms for supervis-ory goals by subjecting banks to specific dis-closure requirements. The final version of therevision mainly comprised the taking onboard of changes in Pillar 1. This has resultedin a degree of detail in disclosure rules thathas encountered some criticism from thebanking industry. It must be borne in mind,however, that the markets should be able tosufficiently assess banks’ risk profiles.
The transparency rules of Pillar 3 at the Euro-
pean level largely match the Basel Frame-work. However, some differences in termin-ology and definitions do exist, as in the caseof own capital, the impact of which carriesover from Pillar 1 to Pillar 3. A further key dif-ference is that disclosure in the Basel Frame-work is generally on a biannual basis, where-as the current version of the EC Directivestates that the disclosure frequency shouldgenerally be annual. This constitutes justifi-

88able and reasonable relief for smaller non-
capital-market-oriented institutions. In add-ition, Brussels will give national supervisorsspecific authority to require banks to disclosemore frequently, to use a specific medium orlocation of disclosure and also to use specificmeans of verification.
In both the development of Pillar 3 in Basel as
well as in its transposition into European law,great emphasis was placed on an objectivepresentation of own funds, the capital re-quirements for individual risk categories andthe risk profile pursuant to Pillar 1. In future,it will be important for markets to use themuch improved insight into banks’ risk andown funds situations offered by the Pillar 3disclosures and for banks, for their part, toprovide sufficient explanations for conspicu-ous changes in individual items, as and whennecessary, in order to avoid misinterpret-ations. In this manner, Pillar 3 should providea valuable contribution to further improvingcommunication between the banking indus-try and the financial markets.
Harmonisation of prudential supervisory
solvency reports in Europe
The system of prudential supervisory reports
on the solvency of institutions (Principle I inGermany) will continue to exist alongside thenew disclosure requirements pursuant to Pil-lar 3. However, in the interest of minimisingcosts, particularly for internationally activebanks, and to strengthen supervisory cooper-ation in Europe, the prudential supervisory re-porting procedure will be matched to thenew capital Framework on a harmonised
basis.
In preliminary deliberations on the feasibility
of a harmonised European reporting systemby the newly created Committee of EuropeanBanking Supervisors (CEBS), it is being dis-cussed whether the composition of the cap-ital ratio can be presented with a maximumof uniformity for all credit institutions regard-less of the type of annual accounts (using theInternational Accounting Standards (IAS) ornational accounting methods). In the comingmonths, the degree of detail of European re-porting regulations in this area also needs tobe clarified. Consideration is also being givento the extent to which a certain degree offlexibility regarding the details to be reported– given uniformly binding headings – couldfacilitate appropriate solutions.
The introduction of group-level International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with ef-fect from 2005 requires that thought begiven to joint European solutions in the fieldof supervisory reporting requirements for thebalance sheet and the profit and loss (P&L)account, too. This is necessary not only out ofcost considerations but also given that therelatively highly aggregated IAS classificationprinciples for the balance sheet and the P&Laccount are relatively unsuited to supervisorypurposes. At the European level, therefore,possibilities for a detailed uniform report onthe balance sheet and the P&L account willneed to be discussed in due course.

89A fourth Quantitative Impact Study
(QIS 4)
In parallel to the development of the revised
Framework, the Basel Committee has alreadyconducted three Quantitative Impact Studies(QIS) in the past few years. Supervisory au-thorities hope that a fourth Quantitative Im-pact Study will provide more reliable data onthe calibration to unexpected losses, securi-tisation exposures and the Advanced Meas-urement Approach (AMA) for operationalrisk. Furthermore, the new methodologicalrequirements for estimating LGD should betaken into account.
Nine of the G10 countries are currently plan-
ning to conduct a QIS 4 before the end of theyear. Even in the run-up to the parallel calcu-lation phase, this study can provide valuableinformation for issues that are still being dis-cussed, especially regarding a future need forrecalibration. In Germany, QIS 4 will belaunched on 1 December 2004 and is to becompleted by the end of February 2005.
Implementation periods and transitional
arrangements
The Basel Framework is to have been imple-
mented in the G10 countries by the end of2006. The most advanced risk measurementapproaches, ie the Advanced IRB Approachfor credit risk and the AMA for operationalrisk, however, may be used for calculatingregulatory capital only as of the end of 2007.This is intended to give institutions an add-itional year to meet the minimum require-ments associated with these approaches. In
addition, international competitive equality isto be maintained. The early implementationof advanced approaches in only a few coun-tries could have an impact on competition.
The draft European Directive likewise speci-
fies in detail the methods of calculating ownfunds that will be valid from 2007. By analogyto the Basel Framework, institutions areallowed to apply the Standardised Approachand the Foundation IRB Approach to creditrisk and the Basic Indicator Approach andStandardised Approach to operational risk.Moreover, in 2007, all institutions will alsohave the option of using the current rules(Basel I) for measuring capital for that specificyear. For institutions in countries in which thestate of preparations is not very far advanced,this provides the necessary scope to beginusing their preferred approach around theend of 2007 without first having to invest re-sources in the implementation of an ap-proach that would most likely be used foronly one or very few years.
At the Basel level, in 2006, a parallel calcula-
tion using the current and the new rules– similar to the Quantitative Impact Studies(QIS) of which several have already been con-ducted – is to be performed. The primary pur-pose of the parallel calculation is to reviewthe risk-weighting functions once again andto make any necessary or appropriate adjust-ments. By contrast, the European Directivedoes not explicitly provide for a parallel calcu-lation. However, institutions wishing to usethe Foundation IRB Approach as of 2007 willneed prior permission from supervisors based

90Impact of the EL-UL decisions and other Basel Committee decisions up to
June 2006
Based on the third Quantitative Impact Study
(QIS 3), a rough re-estimation of the impactof the changes published with the new cap-ital adequacy framework at the end ofJune 2004 was carried out. The table belowshows the extent to which a bank with a cap-ital ratio of 8% would have to adjust its cap-ital in order to maintain this minimum capitalratio under the new Basel Accord.
1
In the Standardised Approach, the results forGerman banks are virtually identical to theG10 average; for Group 2 banks, the min-imum capital requirements are unchangedcompared with the current Accord.
The reasons why the results for German banks
differ from the G10 and EU averages in theIRB Approaches include the specific economic
environment, possible uncertainty about howto apply the new Basel definition of defaultand the limited availability of data needed toestimate the key risk parameters PD and LGD.In certain cases, LGD estimates are likely tohave been on the conservative side as a result.
The divergence between the results for
Group 1 and Group 2 banks is due primarilyto the difference in the volume of retail busi-ness. Owing to lower risk weights, a high vol-ume of retail business will lead to lower min-imum capital requirements.
If the results are aggregated for whichever
approach is most likely to be applied,
3there is
an average reduction of 4.2% in the min-imum capital requirements across the G10.For German banks, however, a 6.5% rise wascalculated. In order to ensure that the min-imum capital requirements are maintained,which is a key goal of calibration in the entiresystem, the Basel Committee envisaged using– if necessary – a scaling factor to adjust risk-weighted assets for credit risk. Based on theQIS 3 data, they would have to be multipliedby a factor of 1.06 to offset the 4.2% reduc-tion in the minimum capital requirements.The final calibration will, however, probablybe conducted in 2006 on the basis of the re-sults of QIS 4 and the experience gained dur-ing the parallel calculation phase.
1Changes in both the numerator (possibilities of offsetting
provisions and EL) and the denominator of the capital ratiowere taken into account. — 2A distinction was made be-
tween internationally active banks with a core capital of atleast 53 billion (Group 1 banks) and all other banks
(Group 2 banks). Data from 58 German credit institutions– six Group 1 banks and 52 Group 2 banks – were used inthe international comparisons. — 3The aggregate results
were often calculated separately for the Foundation IRBApproach and the Advanced IRB Approach. It must benoted that the calculation of the aggregate figures for theFoundation IRB Approach also used data from those banksthat are highly likely to apply the Advanced IRB Approach,resulting in a double inclusion of the data.

91on an on-site audit of their internal rating sys-
tem. However, since it makes sense to per-form such examinations only on rating sys-tems that have already been implemented in-ternally and are being used in daily creditbusiness, this means that, in 2006, non-Baselinstitutions will also be required to have atechnical lead-time in the Foundation IRB Ap-proach; this, however, will be restricted tocredit business and will not be a completeparallel calculation.
Outlook: National implementation of the
new capital rules
Most of the new rules will be implemented
by adapting and adding to the SolvencyRegulation (currently known as Principle I).This regulation specifies in detail the ad-equacy of own funds as required by section10 of the German Banking Act. Work has al-
ready begun on implementing the changes tothe capital adequacy rules. In the run-up tothe actual legislative process, supervisors arealready cooperating closely with institutionsand associations of institutions in a “WorkingGroup on the Implementation of Basel II” andin specific expert councils on individual as-pects of the new Basel Framework (IRB Ap-proach, collateral, securitisation exposures,operational risk, Pillar 2, Pillar 3). In this way,institutions’ concerns can be addressed pro-actively so as to increase the overall efficiencyof the implementation procedure.
The following Annexes provide further
explanations and an overview of thesubject matter of this article in tabularform.
Annex 1
Technical details of the calibration of risk
weights in the IRB Approach
In principle, regulatory capital charges are intend-
ed to cover unexpected losses (UL). Expected loss(EL) is a calculable cost component of credit busi-ness which is supposed to be covered by provisionsand interest margins. Specifically, the Basel riskweight functions now determine the regulatorycapital requirement to cover the 99.9% quantile ofthe portfolio loss distribution function in a one-factor model less EL. In this example, for a normedEAD of one euro, EL is defined as the product ofPD and LGD.UL calibration is a key reason why the require-
ments for internal LGD estimations in the Ad-vanced IRB Approach had to be rewritten. From atheoretical perspective, the LGD parameter can beunderstood as an average or expected, ie default-weighted, loss ratio that is not oriented to a specif-ic economic scenario. The UL risk weight, by con-trast, describes the loss that occurs if a systemicrisk becomes significant, eg owing to an adverseeconomic scenario. To take account of this system-ic risk, the input PD is converted into a “stress PD”by applying the appropriately adjusted UL risk-weight function prescribed by supervisors. For theLGD parameter, by contrast, the downturn scen-ario must already be included in the estimatedSolvency

The regulatory capital requirement for a loan is
calculated by multiplying the risk weight with theexpected exposure at default (EAD) and the sol-vency coefficient (8%).
II Capital requirements for defaulted exposures
The capital requirement for defaulted exposures
corresponds to the unexpected lossUL¼EAD/C2LGD/C0EL, where expected loss
EL¼EAD/C2ELGD is calculated using the default-
weighted ELGD.

93value as it is entered into the UL risk-weight func-
tion without being transformed.11
The mean LGD is accordingly a lower limit for thedownturn LGD. This downturn LGD can be calcu-lated from, for instance, LGDs in time periods char-acterised by large credit losses. For credit exposureswhere the LGD is independent of cyclical move-ments, mean LGD and downturn LGD could beidentical.
In the new Basel Framework, the downturn LGD is
applied to non-defaulted loans both when deter-mining UL and when determining EL. This simplifi-cation allows credit institutions to use only a singleestimated value of LGD to determine the regula-tory capital requirements. The estimated value iscalculated for each individual category of assetsand/or collateral.In the case of defaulted exposures, the LGD par-
ameter is calculated individually for each exposure.A distinction is made here between mean LGD anddownturn LGD. When calculating EL, an expectedLGD value that takes into account the current eco-nomic environment and the current value of thecollateral is estimated. The difference betweendownturn LGD and expected LGD is a UL riskweight for a latent, systemic risk in the part of adefaulted exposure for which no specific provisionor write-offs have yet been made.Risk weights as %

11The justification for this difference in the treatment of
PD and LGD is that the impact of a downturn on LGD is
dependent on additional factors such as the type of ex-
posure and the type of collateral. Accordingly, the super-
visory requirement of a function to convert median LGDs
to downturn LGDs – analogously to the approach applied
to PDs – would ultimately lack sufficient flexibility and
risk sensitivity.

94The risk-weight functions are shown graphically in
the above chart. Deducting EL as the product ofPD and LGD in the second term of the risk-weightfunction (see formula (1) in the explanations onpage 92) takes into account the fact that it onlycovers UL.
In addition, the UL calibration means that, in the
IRB Approach, credit institutions must compare cal-culated expected losses with provisions set aside.Insufficient coverage of EL will lead to a deductionin equal parts from the group’s core capital andadditional capital. By contrast, surpluses of provi-sions can be recognised as additional capital up to0.6% of the risk-weighted assets for credit risk. Ifthe amount of provisioning exceeds EL, this doesnot necessarily mean that the credit institution hasset aside too much in provisions. Rather, deviations
between EL and provisions can be due to differ-ences in their calculation methodology. For ex-ample, regulatory EL is based on a one-year timehorizon, whereas external accounting standardsusually count the entire time to maturity of the ex-posure. In individual cases, this may lead to over-coverage of EL.
The inclusion of overcoverage of EL in additional
capital is intended to promote the building of pro-visions. At the same time, competitive equality be-tween institutions is to be maintained by settingan upper limit for the inclusion of provisions, sincethe rules and practices of building provisions differfrom one country to another.

98Annex 3: Expected loss in the IRB Approach and incurred loss under IAS
PositionExpected loss (EL) in Basel II’s IRB Approaches for
corporate, sovereign and bank exposures as well asfor retail exposures Incurred loss under IAS (IAS 39.58 ff)
Concept – Cost components of a loan.
– In Basel II, EL is covered by provisions/risk
provisioning in the financial statements.– Covered through provisions and accruals that are
based on objective and evident observations.
Definition Non-defaulted exposures
The amount of EL is calculated as the product of– probability of default (PD)– loss given default (LGD) (collateral having been
taken into account)
– exposure at default (EAD)
Defaulted exposures
– Banks use a best estimate of EL; banks following
the Foundation IRB Approach are obliged touse supervisory estimates of LGD.
– The best estimate of EL is based on economic
circumstances and the facility status.
A loan is classified as defaulted if one or both of
the following apply.
– The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely
to pay its credit obligations in full withoutrecourse by the bank to actions such as realisingcollateral.
– The borrower is more than 90 days past due on
his/her payments.The provision requirement for defaultable financial
instruments is calculated for
– financial assets that are valued at amortised cost
(loans and receivables as well as held-to-maturityfinancial instruments) as the difference betweenthe asset’s carrying amount and the presentvalue of estimated cash flows discounted at thefinancial asset’s original effective interest rate(IAS 39.63)
– financial assets in the available-for-sale category,
measured at fair value, as the difference be-tween the historical cost and the current fairvalue result in a shift from capital into the profitand loss account (IAS 39.68)
Time period Under Basel II, the probability of default (PD) is
based on a period of one year.In the accounting system, defaults are calculated
across the residual maturity of the loan portfolio.
Objectivisation/
evidenceThe estimate for probability of default (PD) is
based specifically on long-term historicalexperience.An assessment of the potential default threat is
based primarily on objective observations at thetime of valuation. Losses from future events arenot taken into account.
In essence, it can be assumed that expected loss and incurred loss are sometimes identical (ie on a multi-year average and
an approximately stable portfolio composition). The reason for this is that, pursuant to both Basel II and the relevant rulesof IAS 39, an objective analysis of the default risk must be carried out in order to quantify the potential default threat ofa financial asset. In each case, the default must be identifiable according to evident insight. According to Basel II, anestimation of the probability of default must be based on historical statistical data. When calculating the default risk ac-cording to the IAS 39 incurred loss approach, too, there should be sufficient evidence for determining the provisions interms of the available historical data on financial instruments with the same risk structure. Nevertheless, differences mayarise between expected loss and incurred loss as a result of the differing time periods, as the longer time period in theaccounting system could often lead to higher provisions in the incurred loss model. The opposite may be true for theexpected loss model, as loans on which payments are more than 90 days past due are considered defaulted but are notnecessarily subject to individual provisions.
1On the other hand, it can be assumed that such past due loans will also have
visibly higher default rates, which again will result in correspondingly higher general provisions.
1It is assumed that the current German system for individ-
ual and general provisions can be retained under IAS 39.
