Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic output is likely to have re -
mained unchanged overall in the final quarter 
of 2019, with the two- speed development of 
the economy continuing. The domestic econ -
omy still provided impetus. The fairly favour -
able labour market and income prospects 
maintained households’ strong appetite for 
consumption despite the weak overall eco -
nomic development. Enterprises in the retail 
trade sector regarded their business situation 
as exceedingly good at the end of the year, 
accord ing to the Ifo Institute. The domestic 
construction sector was another beneficiary of 
households’ positive income prospects and the 
very favourable financing conditions. There are 
still no signs of the construction boom coming 
to an end. By contrast, the downturn in the 
export- oriented industry has persisted. How -
ever, evidence has been growing recently that 
manufacturing could stabilise at the beginning 
of 2020. The order situation in the industrial 
sector has not shown any further deterioration 
for several months, and exports of goods have 
risen perceptibly. At the same time, business 
expectations of industrial enterprises bright -
ened somewhat in the final months of last year, 
according to the Ifo Institute. Short- term ex -
port expectations likewise recovered slightly, 
entering positive territory again for the first 
time in six months.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, real gross domestic 
product increased by 0.6% in 2019 (also 0.6% 
after calendar adjustment). Total output thus 
rose at a considerably slower pace compared 
with the significant 1.5% rise in the previous 
year. On the supply side, gross value added in 
manufacturing experienced a strong and 
broad- based decline. By contrast, the boom in 
construction continues unabated. The services sectors also remained intact overall and pro -
vided considerable impetus. On the expend -
iture side, economic growth was mainly ham -
pered by the weak development in German 
exports and investment in machinery and 
equipment. By contrast, private and govern -
ment consumption expenditure was clearly 
higher.
Industry
German industrial output experienced a steep 
rise in November 2019, up by 1% on the Octo -
ber level in seasonally adjusted terms. How -
ever, on an average for October and Novem -
ber, industrial output was significantly lower 
than the average for the third quarter (-1½%). 
The two largest sectors of German industry 
– the automotive industry, which has been per -
forming weakly for quite some time now, and 
mechanical engineering – accounted for most 
of the decline. By contrast, other transport 
equipment provided some impetus. The output 
of computer, electronic and optical products 
stagnated and the production of capital goods 
declined strongly overall (-3½%). On the other 
hand, manufacturers of intermediate goods 
reported  slight growth in output (+¼%). This 
was mainly due to the substantial increase in 
the production of chemicals. The manufacture 
of consumer goods recorded an even stronger 
rise (+1%) on the back of an exceptionally steep 
expansion in production in the pharmaceutical 
industry.
Industrial orders fell substantially in November 
2019, and were down by 1¼% on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms. By contrast, taking 
the average of October and November, the in -
flow of orders was unchanged on the quarter, 
but disregarding large orders, which are gener -
ally received on an irregular basis, it went down 
for this period, too (-¾%). Broken down by 
economic region, the development was highly German econ -
omy likely to 
have stagnated

heterogeneous. For example, new orders re -
ceived from non- euro area countries were 
down sharply (-4%) and there was also a con -
siderable decline in demand for industrial 
goods in Germany (-1¾%). By contrast, new 
orders from the euro area surged (+9¾%) 
although  large orders in the other transport 
equipment sector were a key factor here. It 
should be noted that the direct origin plays a 
major role in the regional classification of 
orders. It is conceivable that they are also 
assigned  to the euro area if the original order is 
forwarded – partly or fully – from a non- euro 
area country to Germany via a euro area coun -
try. Broken down by sector, manufacturers of 
intermediate and consumer goods reported an 
increase in demand (+¼% and +1½% in each 
case). The intake of orders in the capital goods 
sector was down slightly compared with the 
previous quarter (-¼%), however. This was 
mainly attributable to weak mechanical engin -
eering orders across all regions.
Nominal industrial sales did not follow the 
sharply stronger industrial output in November 
2019, but remained unchanged on the previ -
ous month. On an average for October and 
November, there was a slight decline of ¼% on 
the third quarter. With regard to the sectors, 
sales of intermediate and capital goods had a 
dampening effect. By contrast, manufacturers 
of consumer goods reported a steep rise in 
sales, which was mainly due to extremely 
strong growth in foreign sales in the pharma -
ceutical sector. Industrial foreign sales moved 
sideways overall, whilst a perceptible dip in 
sales was recorded in Germany. Nominal ex -
ports of goods decreased strongly in November 
2019 after seasonal adjustment (-2¼%), but for 
October and November combined they were 
significantly higher than the previous quarter in 
nominal and real terms (+1%). Nominal goods 
imports in November were down perceptibly 
on the month (-½%). On an average of the first 
two months of the final quarter, they were 
considerably higher than the level of the third 
quarter (+1%). Growth was somewhat lower in 
real terms (+¾%) due to higher energy prices.Industrial sales

Construction
Construction output in November 2019 showed 
a strong seasonally adjusted increase (+2½%) 
on October, the figure for which was revised 
upwards substantially. On an average for Octo -
ber and November, construction output thus 
also expanded steeply on the third quarter 
(+2¼%). This was mainly attributable to strong 
growth in construction activity in the finishing 
trades (+3½%), although output in the main 
construction sector was likewise up signifi -
cantly (+1%). The boom in the German con -
struction sector is likely to continue. New 
orders in the main construction sector dipped 
slightly in October –  more recent figures are 
not yet available – compared with the previous 
quarter (-¼%), but the inflow of orders was 
nevertheless at a very high level. Both the reach 
of orders and equipment utilisation in the main 
construction industry were also well above 
average at the end of the year.
Labour market
The development in employment was cau -
tiously positive. Employment showed a further 
slight increase in November, though without 
matching the relatively high growth recorded 
in the previous month. There were 13,000 
more persons in work in seasonally adjusted 
terms than in October. Compared with the 
level recorded in November 2018, the total 
number of employees rose by 304,000 or 
0.7%. According to the initial figure provided 
by the Federal Employment Agency, employ -
ment subject to social security contributions 
was up strongly in October. The increase of half 
a million jobs recorded within the last 12 months 
was considerably higher than the growth in 
total employment. By contrast, the number of 
persons exclusively employed in low- paid part- 
time work or self- employed declined, as be -
fore. The persistent economic slack is reflected 
in the further rise in the number of employees 
in cyclical short- time work, which affected 
84,000 persons in October. According to the Ifo employment barometer, enterprises’ willing -
ness to recruit new staff was again down 
somewhat compared with the previous month. 
The number of reported vacancies also showed 
a further marked decline, but remained fairly 
high.
The number of persons registered as un -
employed rose slightly in December, after de -
clining markedly in the previous month. After 
seasonal adjustment, 2.28 million people were 
officially registered as unemployed with the 
Federal Employment Agency, around 8,000 
more than in November. The unemployment 
rate remained unchanged at 5.0%, and there 
was no change in year- on- year terms either. 
The month- on- month increase is mainly for 
cyclical reasons and occurred in the category of 
SGB III job seekers (those receiving unemploy -
ment benefits under the statutory unemploy -
ment insurance scheme). As this report went to 
press, the unemployment barometer of the In -
stitute for Employment Research (IAB) remained 
almost unchanged close to the neutral thresh -
old. This suggests that the unemployment fig -
ures are unlikely to change very much in the 
next few months.
Prices
Oil prices went up further in December against 
the backdrop of additional and prolonged pro -
duction cutbacks by OPEC and its partner states 
and the partial agreement announced in the 
trade dispute between the United States and 
China. They were around 5% higher than in 
November. There was a significant increase on 
the year for the first time in more than twelve 
months. Influenced by heightened political ten -
sions in the Middle East, prices have since risen 
again slightly at times. As this report went to 
press, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil 
stood at US$65. Crude oil futures were still 
trading at marked discounts, however. The dis -
count on crude oil futures was US$3 for deliv -
eries six months ahead and US$5 for deliveries 
12 months ahead.Substantial

After seasonal adjustment, both import and 
producer prices were perceptibly higher in No -
vember than the previous month. At the import 
level, this was attributable to a steep rise in en -
ergy prices, while prices for other goods con -
tracted somewhat. In industrial domestic sales, 
prices rose moderately both including and ex -
cluding energy, with levels still down on the 
year. The decline amounted to 2.1% in the case 
of import prices and 0.7% in the case of indus -
trial producer prices.
Consumer prices (HICP) in December rose again 
moderately in seasonally adjusted terms, with 
energy and food prices largely unchanged. By 
contrast, industrial goods excluding energy be -
came significantly more expensive, partly due 
to the sharp fluctuations in prices for clothing. 
Prices for services were also moderately higher. 
Overall, the annual HICP rate rose from 1.2% to 
1.5%.1 The rate excluding energy and food re -
mained almost unchanged at 1.7%. The statis -
tical effect in the case of package holidays, 
which since July had largely distorted the an -
nual HICP rates downwards, no longer had an 
impact.2 On an average for 2019, headline 
HICP inflation, at 1.4%, was significantly lower 
than the previous year (1.9%), mainly due to 
dwindling energy inflation. Excluding energy 
and food, however, the rate increased margin -
ally from 1.3% to 1.4%.
Public finances3
Local government finances
Local government (core budgets and off-  
budget entities) posted a slight deficit at the 
end of the third quarter of 2019, after record -
ing a surplus of just over €1½ billion a year 
earlier. Although revenue saw a dynamic rise of 
4½% (€3 billion), expenditure growth was con -
siderably stronger, at 7% (€4½ billion). State 
government payments made the largest contri -
bution (+6½%, or €1½ billion) to revenue 
growth. Receipts from fees likewise expanded 
robustly. This may be partly due to the inclusion of additional units in the statistics compared 
with the previous year, which also had corres -
ponding effects on the expenditure side. Tax 
revenue saw only a weak rise of ½%, amid 
considerable variation among the statewide 
figures. Having increased by 4% up to mid-  
2019, revenue from local business tax (after de -
ducting the shares accruing to other govern -
ment levels) fell significantly (-8%). This devel -
opment is in line with the October tax estimate. 
On the expenditure side, there was strong 
growth in other operating expenditure (+9%) 
and fixed asset formation (+13%). Spending on 
social benefits rose by 4½%. The increase in so -
cial assistance payments (+6%) accelerated 
somewhat, and the decline in asylum seeker 
benefits largely tailed off. Growth in personnel 
expenses, reaching 3% at the end of the 
period, was far slower than that in overall ex -
penditure. However, this significantly under -
states the underlying development, as the third 
quarter of 2018 was marked by back- payments 
resulting from the 2018 increase in negotiated 
pay rates.
Local government posted a cumulated slight 
deficit of €½ billion after the first three quarters 
of the year, compared with a surplus of €2½ 
billion a year earlier. With the usual seasonal 
pattern in the fourth quarter, a large surplus is 
likely for 2019 as a whole (2018: €10 billion). 
This year and in the medium term, local gov -
ernment surpluses will probably be gradually 
depleted. In view of the identified requirements 
and overall financial leeway, investment and 
other operating expenditure, among other 
items, should increase significantly in the com -
ing years.Import and

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

With budgets almost in balance overall, the 
level of local government debt changed very 
little compared with mid-2019, totalling €135 
billion at the end of the third quarter. Out -
standing cash advances, which are actually in -
tended simply to bridge short-  term liquidity 
shortfalls, fell slightly but still came to €37 bil -
lion. Their high volume, above all in North 
Rhine-  Westphalia, Rhineland- Palatinate and 
Saarland, illustrates that action is still needed, 
primarily from the local governments in ques -
tion but also from their federal states.4
In 2018, Hesse had already almost fully as -
sumed the cash advances of its local govern -
ments and, in return, tightened up its local 
government budget legislation.5 At the end of 
2019, the state parliament of Saarland passed 
legislation for its state government to assume 
€1 billion in such legacy debt. This corresponds 
to around half of the outstanding cash ad -
vances in Saarland. Saarland’s local govern -
ments are to repay the remainder by the end of 
2064 using budget surpluses.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2019, issuance in the German 
bond market stood at €116.7 billion in gross 
terms (previous month: €109.6 billion). After 
deducting redemptions, which were signifi -
cantly lower than in the previous month, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own debt securities, the outstanding 
volume of domestic bonds grew by €38.4 bil -
lion. Foreign debt securities worth €4.7 billion 
net were sold in Germany. The funds raised 
from sales of domestic and foreign debt secur -
ities in the German market therefore amounted 
to €43.0 billion.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €18.4 
billion net in the reporting month. Ultimately, 
this was chiefly attributable to central govern -
ment (€16.5 billion). Above all, it issued Federal notes (Bobls: €5.7 billion) and two-year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze: €4.3 billion) as well as 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills: €3.4 billion) 
and ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds: €2.3 bil -
lion). State and local government issued bonds 
worth €2.0 billion net.
The outstanding volume of debt securities is -
sued by domestic credit institutions grew by 
€13.5 billion in November, following net re -
demptions of €17.2 billion in the preceding 
month. On balance, this principally involved 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions (€9.9 billion), but there was also 
smaller-scale issuance of mortgage Pfandbriefe 
(€3.7 billion).
German enterprises increased their capital mar -

month. Non-financial corporations were the High cash

chief issuers of bonds, on balance, but other 
financial intermediaries were also active in the 
market. The majority of the bonds issued had 
maturities of more than one year.
On balance, foreign investors were among the 
investor groups on the buyers’ side of the mar -
ket in November, adding German bonds worth 
€15.7 billion net to their portfolios. Domestic 
non-banks increased their holdings of bonds by 
€14.2 billion, favouring domestic securities. 
The Bundesbank acquired debt securities 
amounting to €7.5 billion net - from November, 
also via the Eurosystem’s renewed asset pur -
chase programmes. German credit institutions 
added debt securities with a net value of €5.6 
billion to their portfolios, striking a more or less 
even balance between domestic and foreign 
securities.Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.2 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market (October: €0.4 billion). 
The outstanding volume of foreign shares in 
the German market rose by €3.6 billion over 
the same period. Domestic non-banks and do -
mestic credit institutions were, on balance, the 
main purchasers of equities (€2.1 billion and 
€1.9 billion respectively), while foreign invest -
ors marginally reduced their holdings of Ger -
man equities (€0.1 billion).
Mutual funds
In November, domestic mutual funds recorded 
net inflows of €12.3 billion (previous month: 
€11.6 billion). In net terms, fresh funds were 
injected chiefly into specialised funds reserved 
for institutional investors (€9.7 billion). Among 
the asset classes, mixed securities-based funds 
attracted the most inflows (€3.6 billion), though 
they were also recorded by bond funds (€2.9 
billion), open-end real estate funds (€2.3 bil -
lion) and funds of funds (€2.0 billion). Foreign 
mutual funds placed shares worth €6.4 billion 
in the German market in the reporting month. 
On balance, domestic non-banks were virtually 
the sole purchasers, adding a net €18.5 billion 
worth of mutual fund shares to their portfolios. 
In net terms, domestic credit institutions and 
foreign investors only marginally increased their 
holdings of mutual fund shares (€0.1 billion 
respect ively).
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €24.9 billion in November 2019, putting it 
€2.0 billion above the level of the previous 
month. Although the surplus in the goods ac -
count decreased considerably, the balance in 
invisible current transactions, which comprises 
the services account as well as primary and sec -
ondary income, increased to a greater degree.Net purchases

In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account declined by €4.1 billion on the 
month to €18.9 billion. In this context, exports 
of goods fell more sharply than imports.
Invisible current transactions recorded a €6.1 
billion surplus in November, compared with a 
slight deficit of €0.1 billion one month earlier. 
The main reason for the balance increase was 
the turnaround in the services account’s bal -
ance from a deficit of €4.6 billion in October to 
a slight surplus of €0.1 billion. Although re -
ceipts in the services account contracted, pri -
marily owing to decreases in the areas of other 
business- related services, financial services, 
transport and travel, expenditure fell to a much 
greater extent. This was mainly the result of the 
usual seasonal decline in travel expenditure, 
but also compounded by lower spending in 
other components, most notably computer ser -
vices. Moreover, the deficit in secondary in -
come fell by €0.9 billion to €3.6 billion, notably 
due to lower payments to the EU budget in the 
context of financing related to gross national 
income. In addition, net receipts in primary in -
come rose by €0.7 billion to €9.6 billion. Re -
ceipts were up marginally, which was chiefly 
linked to higher dividends and income on in -
vestment fund shares. In addition, expenditure 
saw a slight decline, which was largely attribut -
able to somewhat lower payments of income 
from direct investment and dividends to non-  
residents.
In November 2019, developments in the finan -
cial markets were affected by political uncer -
tainty linked to international trade disputes and 
the imminent parliamentary election in the 
United Kingdom. Against this backdrop, Ger -
many’s cross- border portfolio investment re -
corded net capital imports in the amount of 
€0.4 billion, compared with net capital exports 
of €34.7 billion in October. Non- resident in -
vestors made net acquisitions of German secur -
ities totalling €15.6 billion. They acquired

was accounted for by reinvested earnings. 
Non- resident enterprises invested a net amount 
of €12.5 billion in Germany after having with -
drawn €2.1 billion in October. This was chiefly 
attributable to €10.3 billion worth of funds

primary reason for this was the rise in the Bun -

The upswing in loans to enterprises in 
Germany  between 2014 and 2019
Over the past few years, there has been a sustained increase in loans granted by German banks 
to non- financial corporations in Germany across all maturities, economic sectors and categories 
of bank. The ongoing economic recovery and the reduced costs of credit financing were material 
factors behind this upswing. However, these two variables alone cannot fully explain the steep 
growth in loans to enterprises.
Other potential determinants can be found on both the loan demand and loan supply sides. On 
the demand side, the main factors of relevance were the persistently low interest rate level as well 
as shifts in enterprises’ funding structure and in the investment activity of individual economic 
sectors. Due to brisk construction activity as well as the associated upward pressure on prices for 
construction work and real estate, financing needs increased mainly in the construction and real 
estate sector. This economic sector typically has a relatively high ratio of loans to value added, 
which meant that loans to the sector became a driving force behind the upswing in lending. On 
the supply side, it is noted that banks once again eased their lending policies in recent years, an 
action they attributed primarily to tight competition in the banking sector.
An additional role was played by the Eurosystem’s non- standard monetary policy measures intro -
duced from 2014, which had a positive impact on loan dynamics over and above their purely 
interest rate- lowering effect. Empirical analyses conducted by the Bundesbank on the basis of 
bank-level data indicate that banks in Germany which participated in targeted longer- term refi -
nancing operations and the expanded asset purchase programme reported higher growth in 
loans to enterprises between 2014 and 2019 than banks which did not participate. Moreover, 
survey data suggest that the negative deposit facility rate in and of itself did make for lower net 
interest income among banks, but has not yet led to any constraints on their lending.
The microeconometric analyses, which model only partial effects of the non- standard measures, 
are supplemented by macroeconometric estimations. Here, too, to arrive at a quantitative esti -
mation of the impact of monetary policy on loan growth, a series of assumptions have to be 
made which have a significant effect on the results. All in all, though, the macroeconomic ana -
lyses also show that the unconventional policy measures implemented from 2014 have had a 
positive overall effect on growth in loans to enterprises in Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
There has been a steep and sustained increase 
in German banks’ loans to non- financial cor -
porations in Germany (also referred to as “loans 
to enterprises” in the following) over the past 
few years. The rise began in 2014, after the an -
nual growth rate for loans to enterprises had 
reached its lowest point of -2½%. In the years 
that followed, it picked up speed continuously, 
reaching a temporary high of 5.9% in June 
2018. Despite the slowing pace of economic 
activity in Germany, the annual growth rate for 
loans to enterprises has since remained at an 
elevated level. Thus, growth in these loans is 
still substantial, even now.
The dynamic expansion in loans was broadly 
based. Regardless of whether loans to enter -
prises are broken down by loan maturity, eco -
nomic sector or category of bank, their re -
spective contributions to loan growth were 
mostly positive in the past two to three years. When broken down by loan maturity, it is par -
ticularly interesting to note the persistent dy -
namic growth in loans with a maturity of over 
five years. These often serve to finance longer, 
usually larger- scale, investment projects (see 
the adjacent chart). By contrast, short-  term 
loans, which are typically more responsive to 
the business cycle, increased only moderately 
or not at all over extended periods. From the 
perspective of the bank managers questioned 
in the Bank Lending Survey (BLS), demand for 
loans among enterprises has risen persistently 
since 2014.
Loan growth is interesting from a monetary 
policy standpoint because bank loans are an 
important source of external finance. This is 
particularly true of enterprises in Germany and 
the euro area, which traditionally raise less 
funding on the capital markets than firms from 
English- speaking countries, say. Bank lending 
to the corporate sector is therefore a key vari -
able in the monetary policy transmission pro -
cess.
This article describes the upswing in loans to 
German enterprises, building on previous Bun -
desbank analyses.1 It examines the causes of 
the elevated level of loan growth observed 
since 2014 and discusses points of note by his -
torical standards.
Loan growth in a cyclical 
context
Current economic conditions and the outlook 
for the real economy generally have a material 
impact on both loan demand and loan supply. 
For example, in periods of economic recovery, 
the risks inherent in lending decrease as cor -
porate profitability improves and valuations of 
loan collateral pick up. As a result, banks are 
more willing to expand their loan supply. At the 
same time, enterprises have a greater need for Prolonged

funding to finance ongoing production and 
make investments during an upturn.
For Germany, too, empirical analyses indicate 
that the relationship between growth in real 
loans to non- financial corporations and cyclical 
developments (measured by growth in real 
gross domestic product (GDP) or real invest -
ment) is close overall and relatively stable over 
time. For the most part, loan growth lags be -
hind GDP growth by between two and six 
quarters.2 This loan lag is commonly explained 
by the role of internal financing: during an eco -
nomic upturn, enterprises can cover their finan -
cing needs with internally generated funds to 
begin with, meaning that their demand for 
loans often comes with something of a delay.3 
During a downturn, on the other hand, they 
have reduced scope for internal financing, 
which boosts their need for (short- term) bank 
funding.4
The above chart plots the development of an -
nual growth rates for real GDP and loans to 
non- financial corporations since 1981. Loans 
(normally shown in nominal terms) have been 
deflated using the GDP deflator to aid compari -
son. The period under analysis includes several 
“classic” upswings in lending which essentially 
demonstrate how real loan growth lags behind 
growth in real GDP:– In 1988, growth in loans to enterprises 
picked up pace owing to the economic up -
turn in West Germany. German reunifica -
tion, the reconstruction of the east and dy -
namic demand for housing construction in 
the eastern federal states subsequently gave 
demand for loans new momentum.
– In 2005 as well, the incipient growth in 
loans to enterprises tracked the robust eco -
nomic recovery in Germany. This was shaped 
by lively investment activity among enter -
prises. The real estate market did not be -
come overheated during this upturn, how -
ever, unlike in other parts of the euro area.
– In early 2010, growth in loans to enterprises 
accelerated again, roughly three quarters 
after the turnaround in the real economy. 
However, this upswing was interrupted 
shortly afterwards by the negative repercus -
sions of the sovereign debt crisis.

began in 2013; it continued to pick up pace 
subsequently.
The strength and scale of the current upswing 
in lending is consistent with past episodes. Al -
though the highest annual growth rate for real 
loans – 4½% in the third quarter of 2018 – was 
lower than the relevant figures for the 1980s 
and 1990s, this was proportionate considering 
that the growth rate for real GDP was also 
below the peak levels seen in earlier upturns.
The current upswing in loans is unique in that 
the annual growth rate for loans to enterprises 
continued to rise even though GDP growth 
was somewhat weaker for a time. This is differ -
ent to past episodes, in which both growth 
rates rose together with a certain lag. The two 
rates only returned to a parallel upward trajec -
tory once the German economy entered a 
boom phase in 2017 and early 2018. In add -
ition to this, loans to enterprises were exhibit -
ing a relatively long lag behind economic devel -opments at the end of the period under analy -
sis. While the economic slowdown started in 
early 2018, loan growth remained elevated for 
another six quarters, until mid- 2019. Thus, the 
comparison of the two annual rates signals 
that there were other factors besides economic 
developments which drove loan growth.
At this point, it makes sense to consider not 
only enterprises’ financing needs, but also their 
financing costs, because loan demand is also 
contingent on movements in lending rates, in 
particular. Interest rates on loans to enterprises 
dropped significantly after the global financial 
crisis began, and also fell distinctly after 2014; 
this coincided with the increase in loans to en -
terprises (see the chart on p. 17).
The box on pp. 18 f. contains a more detailed 
analysis of how loan growth from 2014 on -
wards can be assessed relative to business cycle 
dynamics and interest rate movements. The 
“normal” interactions between dynamics in 
loans to non- financial corporations, the busi -
ness cycle and lending rates are captured by an 
estimated empirical model, which approxi -
mates the dynamic interaction between these 
and other macroeconomic variables. The model 
contains nominal loans and the associated 
lending rate, as well as real GDP and its defla -
tor for Germany and for the rest of the euro 
area, plus a set of financial market variables, 
including an indicator for monetary policy.5 
Using the model, simulations of loans are cal -
culated conditional on the actual business cycle 
and lending rates, and compared with the de -
velopments that were actually observed. The 
model is estimated for the period from the 
second quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter 
of 2013; the starting point for the simulations is 
the first quarter of 2014. In the simulations, 
real GDP , the GDP deflator and the lending rate 
for loans to enterprises in Germany are kept at 
the actually observed values, whereas the loans … the strength

and other variables change endogenously ac -
cording to the model, under this assumption.
Comparing the actual rate of loan growth with 
the simulated distribution allows for an assess -
ment at any point in time of whether the ob -
served level of loan growth is noteworthy rela -
tive to the historical correlations with GDP , the 
GDP deflator and the lending rate. As shown 
by the chart on p. 16, the actual rate of loan 
growth (grey line) rises more rapidly than the 
median of the simulations (black line) and 
moves into the upper range of the simulated 
probability distribution. From the fourth quar -
ter of 2017, the actual rate of loan growth is 
greater than the simulated growth rate, with a 
probability ratio of at least 4:1.6 This means 
that growth in loans to non- financial corpor -
ations was substantially elevated at the end of 
the period under analysis, compared with the 
usual patterns before 2014.
This result rests on a series of assumptions, 
such as the estimation period chosen and the 
starting point for the simulations (see the box 
on pp. 18 f.). But all things considered, the an -
alysis suggests that loan growth in Germany 
over the past few years was more dynamic 
than can be explained by the estimated correl -
ations with GDP and movements in prices and 
lending rates.
Loan demand
This then raises the question of what might be 
driving this loan growth, which is especially dy -
namic by historical standards. Potential explan -
ations are provided by the following compil -
ation of more granular loan data as well as in -
formation from the BLS, the financial accounts 
and economic data.
Observed lending is the outcome of the inter -
play between supply and demand. Thus, the 
upward deviation from the usual pattern of 
loan growth described above may, on the one 
hand, be the result of unusually brisk loan de -mand. On the other hand, it may reflect a his -
torically notable easing of lending policies. Indi -
cations of particularly significant supply or 
demand- side factors can be found in the BLS. 
Its results suggest that both forces had a dis -
cernibly positive impact over the past few 
years.
Low interest rate environment
Where the demand side is concerned, the bank 
managers surveyed for the BLS have perceived 
a persistent increase in demand for loans 
among enterprises since 2014 (see the above 
chart on p. 20). One of the key reasons for this, 
according to their responses, was the low gen -
eral level of interest rates. This is a broad term, 
which does not just cover the bank lending 
rate incorporated into the empirical model de -
scribed above. Rather, it can be regarded as 
synonymous with the exceptionally favourable 
financing costs of enterprises, particularly in 
the past few years. Money market rates and 
capital market rates fell across the board,

A comparison of lending developments using conditional 
forecasts from a BVAR model
The acceleration in the growth of loans to 
non- fi  nancial corporations in Germany that 
has been observed since 2014 raises the 
question of whether this development lines 
up with the relationships that have already 
been observed between lending develop-
ments, the business cycle and movements 
in lending rates.
To analyse this issue, a vector autoregres-
sive (VAR) model with nine variables is em-
ployed.1 This model covers the loans of 
German monetary fi  nancial institutions 
(MFIs) to domestic non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations, the average interest rate for these 
loans, real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and the GDP defl  ator for both Germany 
and the rest of the euro area excluding Ger-
many, and the yields on fi  ve- year govern-
ment bonds in Germany. A shadow short 
rate (Geiger and Schupp (2018)) is used as 
an indicator of the Eurosystem’s monetary 
policy and is extended back for the time 
prior to 1999 with an interest rate on over-
night loans in the German interbank mar-
ket. The fi  ve- year US Treasury yield is in-
tended to help control for any potential in-
fl  uences from the US or the global capital 
market. The model is estimated using quar-
terly data from the period starting in the 
second quarter of 1996 and ending in the 
fourth quarter of 2013, with fi  ve lags in the 
variables. All of the variables except for 
interest and yield enter the model in log- 
levels. The estimation is carried out using 
the Bayesian approach proposed by Gian-
none, Lenza and Primiceri (2015).2
Using the estimated model, forecasts are 
generated for the variables from the fi  rst 
quarter of 2014 up to the second quarter of 
2019, but in these forecasts real GDP , the 
GDP defl  ator and the average interest rate for loans to enterprises in Germany are 
forced to track the values that were actually 
observed over the forecast period (condi-
tional forecasts).3 The fi  rst two variables are 
intended to represent business cycle condi-
tions in Germany and lending rates are 
meant to represent fi  nancing costs. To 
make things clearer, the forecasts for the 
levels of loans to enterprises are then con-
verted into annual growth rates.
The choice of estimation period and start-
ing point places the focus of the analysis on 
the period following the bottoming out of 
the lending growth rate. By comparing the 
probability distribution of the conditional 
forecasts of credit growth with the actual 
growth rate observed, it is possible to as-
sess whether credit growth over the fore-
cast period has noticeably deviated from 
the empirical relationships in the estimation 
1 The model is based on the multi- country BVAR 
model found in Deutsche Bundesbank (2015c). Unlike 
the multi- country model used in that case, which in-
cludes variables of the four largest euro area countries, 
the analysis presented here focuses solely on Germany. 
The rest of the euro area is only taken into account 
through aggregate variables.
2 For a description of the estimation approach, see 
Giannone et al. (2015). The prior distribution is of the 
Minnesota type, for which the hyperparameters are set 
in a data- driven manner. In this application, the hyper-
parameters are fi  xed at the mode of their posterior dis-
tribution, i.e. the estimates ignore the uncertainty 
about the hyperparameters (see Mandler and Schar-
nagl (2019a)). Models drawn in the context of the 
MCMC algorithm where the maximum eigenvalues of 
the companion matrix exceed 1.01 are discarded.
3 The conditional forecast is computed by means of 
the state- space representation of the VAR model using 
the Kalman fi  lter and the Carter- Kohn algorithm. See 
Bańbura et al. (2015). Whilst all other variables are 
forecast dynamically using the model equations, they 
deviate from the unconditional dynamic forecast. The 
reason for this is that the adjustments required to keep 
GDP , the GDP defl  ator and the lending rate on the pre-
scribed path also cause adjustments in the endogen-
ous variables in accordance with the estimated correl-
ation of their residuals with those of the two determin-
ing variables, and these adjustments are then carried 
forward over time through the model dynamics.Deutsche Bundesbank

period. On the other hand, the analysis 
does not permit any direct inferences to be 
made regarding the economic causes of 
these deviations, as the reduced form of 
the model has been used for the forecast.4
In the chart on p. 16, the grey dashed line 
represents the actual annual growth rate of 
loans to non- fi  nancial corporations. The 
black line represents the median of distribu-
tion of the conditional forecasts, while the 
various shaded areas represent the intervals 
between selected percentiles of the distri-
bution.5 The wide ranges between the per-
centiles refl  ect the considerable estimation 
uncertainty. While the loan growth rate ini-
tially hovers near or below the median of 
the forecast distribution, it moves closer to 
the upper edge of the forecast distribution 
towards the end of the forecasting horizon. 
At the end of 2017, the actual growth rate 
exceeds the forecast distribution’s 80th per-
centile, meaning that the probability ratio 
that the actual growth rate exceeds the 
forecast is 4:1 or higher. The result is quali-
tatively robust to the model being expanded 
to cover alternative external sources of 
funds for enterprises or gross fi  xed capital 
formation and to the use of the alternative 
shadow short rate following the approach 
in Wu and Xia (2016).
That said, the results are affected by the 
choice of the forecasts’ estimation period 
and starting point. For example, if the 
model is only estimated up to the second 
quarter of 2008, as in Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2015c), and the forecasts start imme-
diately afterwards, the loan growth rate in 
the fi  rst quarter of 2014 lies in the lower 
part of the conditional forecasts’ distribu-
tion. The faster acceleration afterwards 
could thus be interpreted as a recovery pro-
cess, at least for a certain period of time. 
However, over time, the loan growth rate moves into the upper tail of the forecast 
distribution as in the basic model.
4 The elements of the covariance matrix of the mod-
el’s residuals are very important in terms of the impact 
the prescribed paths of the determining variables have 
on the endogenous variables in the forecast as they 
determine how these endogenous variables react to 
an adjustment to the prescribed values of the deter-
mining variables. However, the elements of the covari-
ance matrix depend on the average structure of the 
economic shocks over the estimation period. The co-
variance matrix depends in part on the relative import-
ance of the various shocks. If this differs markedly in 
the forecast period compared to the estimation period 
because, say, economic developments are being driven 
more strongly by monetary policy while they were 
dominated in the estimation period by demand shocks, 
for instance, then the conditional forecast may differ 
from the actual developments. This problem can be 
solved by constructing the conditional forecasts with 
identifi  ed shocks. The issue of whether certain struc-
tural shocks defi  nitely lend themselves to such an exer-
cise depends on the research question of the analysis. 
One example of this is the estimation of the effects of 
the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme (APP) 
using scenario analyses given in Mandler and Schar-
nagl (2019b).
5 The distribution is the posterior distribution of the 
conditional forecasts and refl  ects the uncertainty 
about both the coeffi   cients of the model equations 
and the elements of the covariance matrix of the 
residuals .Deutsche Bundesbank

est rates in Germany have long since reached 
zero or lower. German banks passed on the de -
crease in market rates for corporate lending 
since the onset of the global financial crisis (see 
the chart on p. 17).7 This is true of loans with 
both short and longer interest rate fixation 
periods. According to BLS data, enterprises re -
sponded to this low interest rate environment 
by increasingly taking up long- term loans and 
thus securing the very low lending rates into 
the long term.
Enterprises in the construction 
and real estate sector
Besides locking in interest rates, the banks sur -
veyed in the BLS also cited the need for funds 
to finance fixed investment as another key mo -
tive for the continued increase in loan demand. 
However, the perception of investment- driven 
loan demand is only partially supported by the 
data on actual private gross fixed capital for -
mation. Nominal gross fixed capital formation 
in Germany, which is relevant to loan demand, 
rose steeply at the start of the economic up -
turn, but the increase progressed at a rather 
muted pace from there, as compared with pre -
vious upturn phases. In particular, investment 
in machinery and equipment, which forms part 
of gross fixed capital formation and is mainly 
conducted by the production sector, grew only 
moderately. By contrast, construction invest -
ment made a weighty contribution to growth 
from 2016 onwards, which was increasing until 
the end of the period under analysis (see the 
lower chart on this page). This investment is pre -
dominantly attributable to enterprises belong -
ing to the construction and real estate sector.8

down by economic sector. These statistics com -
prise loans to the corporate sector; loans to 
households for house purchase are largely ex -
cluded from these statistics.9 According to the 
borrowers statistics, loans to enterprises as -
signed to the construction and real estate sec -
tor have been driving loan growth since 2014 
(see the above chart).10 The contributions to 
growth made by loans to the non- real estate 
services sector and to the production sector 
exclud ing construction, by contrast, began to 
increase  only later, and to a lesser degree. 
Whereas those sectors’ contributions are al -
ready in decline again, loans to construction 
and real estate enterprises have been moving 
sideways at an elevated level. At the current 
end, roughly half of the growth of total corpor -
ate lending is accounted for by loans to enter -
prises in the construction and real estate sector. 
Loans to real estate services enterprises, and in 
this case particularly housing enterprises, made 
especially large contributions to growth.The high share of loans to construction and 
real estate enterprises in total loan growth is a 
particular feature of the current upswing in 
loans. This is illustrated by a comparison with 
the loan growth observed between 2005 and 
2008, a period during which loan growth was 
largely driven by the non- real estate services 
sector and the production sector excluding 
construction (see the above chart). Even during

early 1990s, when the reunification- induced Loans to con -

sixth of all loans to households for house purchase. In the 
breakdown of the borrowers statistics by sector, loans to 
self- employed persons cannot be shown separately. How -
ever, their housing loans are probably spread broadly 
across all sectors of the economy. The borrowers statistics 
series have been adjusted for statistical breaks and purely

construction boom gave fresh momentum to 
loan demand in Germany, the contribution 
made by loans to the non- real estate services 
sector was higher, on the whole.
This raises the question as to why financing 
needs in the construction and real estate sector 
were so high in the past few years. An increase 
in real economic activity is only part of the ex -
planation for the uptick in construction invest -
ment. A more decisive factor was the con -
tinued rise in the prices relevant to construction 
investment since 2016 (see the lower chart on 
p. 20).11 This reflects the boom in the construc -
tion sector, which has led to an across- the- 
board increase in the prices not only of con -
struction work but also of the properties them -
selves.12 One of the reasons for the brisk de -
mand for real estate and real estate- related 
services is the persistent low interest rate set -
ting: as a substitute for low- yielding financial 
investments, real estate has tended to become increasingly attractive to yield- seeking investors 
in the past few years.
The business model of construction and real es -
tate enterprises entails large advance payments 
for both construction work and the purchase 
and renovation of existing properties. Coupled 
with the across- the- board increase in construc -
tion and real estate prices, this business model 
has driven up the sector’s demand for funding 
considerably. Indeed, the construction and real 
estate sector obtains a relatively large percent -
age of its funding through bank loans (see the 
adjacent chart). The share of outstanding loans 
to construction and real estate enterprises in 
sector- specific gross value added, at just shy of 
110% in the third quarter of 2019, was more 
than twice as high as the corresponding aggre -
gate ratio for all other non- financial corpor -
ations.13 Loan intensity as measured in this 
manner has been increasing since 2016, on the 
whole more strongly than in the other branches 
of economic activity. This explains the powerful 
influence of this sector’s high credit demand on 
aggregate corporate lending.
The supportive effect of the high loan intensity 
of the construction and real estate sector on 
aggregate loan growth is especially evident at 
the current end. At the aggregate level, the 
data indicated a relatively long loan lag after 
the slowdown in economic activity, the primary 
cause of which was the slump in activity suf -
fered by export- oriented industry. By contrast, 
even after mid- 2018, the domestically oriented 
sectors provided a boost to economic activity. 
The relatively strong growth in loans observed 
in recent times has been driven, then, by a con -
tinued boom in construction activity that has 
kept credit demand buoyant in the loan-  
intensive construction and real estate sector.Upward pres -

Enterprises’ funding structure
The relatively strong demand for loans was 
fuelled not only by shifts between branches of 
economic activity but also by trend shifts in en -
terprises’ funding structure. One factor at play 
here is the distinct narrowing of non- financial 
corporations’ scope for internal financing since 
the beginning of 2016. This development is re -
flected, above all, in a steady decline in the 
coverage ratio, which is defined as internal fi -
nancing (corporate savings plus consumption 
of fixed capital) over investment. A major rea -
son for this is that compensation of employees 
rose visibly faster than gross value added amid 
favourable labour market trends, causing 
growth of internal financing to lag behind in -
vestment growth, which over the years has re -
mained relatively robust. Non- financial corpor -
ations responded to this decline in internally 
generated funds available for forming fixed 
capital by raising additional external financing 
– including through bank loans.14
Enterprises’ funding structure also shifted be -
cause debt in external financing increased in 
importance at the expense of equity instru -
ments. To wit, not only bank loans but other 
types of debt instruments such as non- bank 
loans or debt securities have attracted signifi -
cantly greater inflows over the past few years. 
There are two factors in particular to which the 
growth in debt-  based funding can be attrib -
uted. One is that, from the mid-  1990s up until 
the onset of the global financial and economic 
crisis, non- financial corporations in Germany 
were able to extensively restore and grow their 
capital base, which had been relatively low fol -
lowing the reunification boom.15 The other is 
that enterprises withstood the global financial 
and economic crisis largely unscathed, and the 
German economy subsequently underwent a 
long upturn. Both of these factors enhanced 
the German corporate sector’s solvency, enab -
ling enterprises to make greater use of debt in -
struments, which are typically less expensive 
than equity funding.16 In addition, the debt fi -
nancing costs for loans and debt securities have, on the whole, fallen considerably faster 
in the past few years than the cost of equity. 
For these reasons, the relatively strong inflows 
into bank loans can be regarded as part of a 
general trend towards debt playing an increas -
ing important role.
Loan supply
The loan supply side likewise provided a signifi -
cant boost. The expansion of lending was 
broadly spread out across categories of bank. 
Lending business at savings banks and co -
operative banks, which has traditionally been 
very stable, supported the across- the- board up -
swing in corporate loans from 2014 onwards. 
Yet the categories of bank which were affected 
more severely by the global financial crisis, es -
pecially commercial banks,17 also saw an in -
creasingly evident rebound in loan growth.
Not only regarding lending rates but also in 
terms of lending policy have banks been ac -
commodative to borrowers. According to the 
BLS, credit standards –  the most important 
measure of bank credit supply policy  – have 
been repeatedly eased in the past few years. 
Firms’ access to bank lending can therefore, on 
the whole, be regarded as having been largely 
unimpeded.18 Banks as a whole listed intensive Greater uptake

14 According to the “pecking order” theory, non- financial 
corporations first tap into their internal funds to finance 
investment. Only once these funds have been exhausted 
do they resort to external funds, especially debt. For a de -
tailed explanation, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018).
15 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2012).
16 According to the “trade- off theory”, enterprises will also 
use a certain amount of equity financing, which is more 
expensive than debt financing, as a buffer against insolv -
ency. If the corporate sector’s solvency improves, for ex -
ample because a larger capital buffer has been built up or 
the economy has improved, an elevated need for funding 
can be met largely through debt without putting solvency 
at risk. For a detailed explanation of the “trade- off theory”, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018).
17 This is an umbrella term which subsumes the following 
categories of bank: large banks, regional and other com -
mercial banks, and the branches of foreign banks.
18 See Marjenko et al. (2019), according to whom ifo 
credit constraint indicator results continue to point to ex -
cellent credit financing conditions for German enterprises.

cited their banks’ lending policy as being restrictive.Deutsche Bundesbank

competition in the banking sector as by far the 
most important reason for easing their lending 
policy. Only recently have the bank managers 
surveyed for the BLS reported tightening up on 
their standards again, consistent with a more 
pessimistic view of the economic outlook.
The highly competitive nature of the banking 
sector also needs to be seen in the context of 
the persistent low interest rate setting. This en -
vironment has not only spurred loan demand 
but also ratcheted up pressure on banks’ mar -
gins and net interest income, making it another 
factor alongside the drop in lending rates 
which has been shaping credit supply policy.19 
In a quest for high- yielding investments, banks 
have sought to increase their maturity trans -
formation as well as to expand their loan vol -
umes in order to stabilise their earnings. They 
have been applying aggressive strategies to 
achieve this objective and to meet as much of 
the elevated loan demand as possible them -
selves. Competitive pressure has driven them to 
be more accommodative to their customers re -
garding margins or other credit terms and con -
ditions. As a case in point, the banks surveyed 
for the BLS reported reducing their margins 
continuously from 2014 to 2018.20 This behav -
iour put added pressure on margins and thus 
created further incentives to “search for yield”.
Impact of non- standard 
monetary policy measures
The foregoing considerations suggest that the 
growth of lending over the past few years 
above and beyond the known historical pat -
terns has something to do with the persistently 
low interest rate level, amongst other factors. 
And that, in turn, is also impacted upon by the 
Eurosystem’s monetary policy. Already in the 
course of the financial and sovereign debt cri -
sis, the Governing Council of the ECB cut euro 
area policy rates to historical lows and took a 
series of unconventional measures. Beginning 
in 2014, the Governing Council felt compelled 
to take further action owing to a drop in price pressures and declining inflation expectations.21 
It responded by reducing the interest rate on its 
main refinancing operations from 0.25% to 0% 
and launching a series of non- standard monet -
ary policy measures. These notably included 
the expanded asset purchase programme 
(APP), targeted longer- term refinancing oper -
ations (TLTROs) and the increasing use of for -
ward guidance. In addition, the interest rate on 
the deposit facility was lowered into negative 
territory for the first time.
These measures were aimed at giving euro area 
economic activity a fillip and thereby returning 
inflation sustainably over the medium term to 
its target. The transmission channels for the in -
dividual measures have different focal points, 
and their interaction occurs over multiple 
layers.22 Ultimately, however, all these meas -
ures were designed to reduce banks’ and en -
terprises’ funding costs, loosen potential fund -
ing and capital constraints, create incentives for 
balance sheet restructuring and thereby pro -
mote the granting of loans and other financial 
resources to the private sector. Hence, the 
measures were transmitted to lending not only 
through lending rates but also through various 
other channels. This could also explain why the 
empirical model described above, which – in 
keeping with the estimated historical interrela -
tionships for the period prior to 2014 – is con -
tingent only on lending rates (besides the busi -
ness cycle), is insufficient and thus fails to cap -
ture a number of key developments from the 
period after 2014.
The semi- annual ad hoc questions asked in the 
BLS reveal initial insights into the contribution 
to German banks’ lending made by the non-  
standard monetary policy measures. According Intensive

to the survey results, the TLTROs, in particular, 
but also the APP had a positive impact on cor -
porate lending volumes. The surveyed banks 
reported using the extra liquidity provided by 
these non- standard measures, on the whole, 
more to increase their loans than to accumu -
late other financial assets or to replace existing 
liabilities. Moreover, the BLS provides evidence 
that the negative deposit facility rate, in isol -
ation, further dampened their already belea -
guered net interest income, yet did not lead 
them to curtail their lending. In fact, as of mid- 
2018, the surveyed banks appear, if anything, 
to have expanded the volume of their corpor -
ate lending in response to the measure.23
To gain deeper insights into how the non-  
standard monetary policy measures have im -
pacted on banks’ lending, empirical models are 
called for. However, a model- based assessment 
of these effects is no easy task. The fact that 
the measures took place almost in parallel and 
not independently of each other makes it more 
difficult to isolate their respective effects. To 
address these challenges, it makes sense to use 
different model approaches to examine the im -
pact of the non- standard measures on lending 
developments and to explore both the micro 
and the macro level.
Analyses at the micro level
Analyses on the basis of microdata, i.e. in this 
case using balance sheet items at the individual 
bank level, have the advantage over analyses of 
aggregated data of enabling the examination 
of average effects over time on the basis of a 
cross-  section comparison. In this case, this 
means comparing lending by banks which 
were directly affected by a monetary policy 
measure, or which participated in it, with lend -
ing by the remaining banks. This allows the ef -
fects of the individual non- standard measures 
to be estimated in isolation from each other. 
However, such analyses can only be carried out 
if it is possible to differentiate between affected 
and unaffected banks. It therefore makes sense for analysis to single out the non- standard 
monetary policy measures that required individ -
ual banks to take action in order to participate. 
This is the case, in particular, for the TLTROs 
and the APP .
TLTROs have been conducted in several 
tranches since September 2014. They have en -
abled banks to borrow money from the Euro -
system at favourable interest rates for a period 
of up to four years. At the same time, in order 
to give banks a stronger incentive to expand 
their loan supply accordingly, participation in 
these operations or the applicable interest rate 
have been conditional on meeting a bench -
mark for loan growth.24 In aggregate terms, 
take- up of the total funds available under the 
TLTROs by banks in Germany has been rela -
tively muted as measured against their total 
assets. This indicates that demand among Ger -
man banks for additional funding was not es -
pecially pronounced overall, not even at at -
tractive financing terms.
The data fed into the analysis presented in the 
box on pp. 26 ff. were mainly sourced from the 
bank- level data in the monthly balance sheet 
statistics. These figures reveal that around one- 
third of banks in Germany have taken part in 
the TLTROs offered by the Eurosystem (see the 
table on p. 30). Take- up was spread relatively 
broadly across categories of bank. Measured in 
terms of the number of banks taking part in the 
TLTROs, savings banks and credit cooperatives 
participated the most. The amounts they bor -
rowed were on the low side overall and spread 
relatively evenly across individual institutions.

23 Consistent with this, Klein (2020) finds, on the basis of 
bank- level data, that the reduced net interest margin in the 
negative interest rate environment did not, ceteris paribus, 
cause euro area banks to constrain their lending.
24 In the case of TLTRO I, banks that failed to meet their 
lending benchmark had to repay the funds they borrowed 
early, and in the case of TLTROs II and III, meeting the rele -
vant benchmark leads to a lower interest rate for the cen -
tral bank loan. Further information on TLTROs I, II and III

The effects of non- standard monetary policy measures on 
German banks’ lending to non- fi  nancial corporations1
It is rather diffi   cult to separate, on the basis 
of aggregated data, the contributions of in-
dividual non- standard measures – especially 
the targeted longer- term refi  nancing oper-
ations (TLTROs) and the asset purchase pro-
gramme (APP)  – towards the recovery of 
loan growth in Germany and the euro area, 
which began in 2014. The impact of the 
non- standard measures is likely to have 
occurred  at the same time, resulting in an 
overlap. It is therefore diffi   cult to distinguish 
between the effects of the individual meas-
ures by looking at the time dimension 
alone. However, using microdata, i.e. infor-
mation on balance sheet items at the level 
of the individual bank, makes it possible to 
analyse average effects based on a cross- 
sectional comparison. To this end, loans 
granted by banks participating in or directly 
affected by a measure are compared with 
the loans granted by all other banks. If the 
affected banks’ loan growth differs from 
that of the control group, this is an indica-
tor of the measure’s effectiveness. For the 
German banking sector, microdata are 
available in the form of a total sample of 
the MFI balance sheet statistics and the MFI 
profi  t and loss statistics.
In the microeconometric literature, partici-
pation in a measure is referred to as “treat-
ment” (in line with how the term is used in 
medicine) and modelled using a binary vari-
able with the values one (for treatment) and 
zero (for non- treatment). While it is clear 
from the refi  nancing volumes taken up at 
the Bundesbank whether a bank partici-
pated in a TLTRO, a bank’s treatment status 
with respect to the APP needs to be ap-
proximated. For the purpose of this analy-
sis, we use a bank’s net selling position2 on 
the government bond market. A bank is 
considered to be “participating” in the APP if it has reduced its net holdings of govern-
ment bonds to a large extent between 
January 2015 and May 2019.3 Below, to 
sharpen identifi  cation of a bank’s treatment 
status, we only consider a bank to be par-
ticipating in either the TLTRO or the APP 
if  its refi  nancing volume or sales volume 
exceeds  the TLTRO median volume or net 
sales volume in the case of government 
bonds (always in relation to the bank’s total 
assets).4
To rule out differences in loan growth rates 
between treated banks and non- treated 
banks caused by factors other than partici-
pation in the programme, the estimation 
takes into account a number of bank char-
acteristics besides treatment which may 
also have had an impact on the bank’s loan 
1 This box is based on a study by Offermanns and 
Blaes (2020). For a similar analysis on bank lending in 
the euro area, see Blaes et al. (2019).
2 Owing to the lack of available transaction data at the 
bank level, net changes are approximated through 
changes in stocks. Bonds issued by euro area govern-
ments are purchased (under certain conditions) in the 
quantitatively most important sub- programme of the 
APP , the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), 
and thus represent a suffi   ciently good approximation 
of the APP’s impact.
3 Reductions in government bond holdings in a bank’s 
portfolio may occur for various reasons. Besides bond 
sales, redemptions of the nominal amount upon ma-
turity will also push down holdings. If the amount is 
not reinvested, it can be argued that this value, too, 
can be attributed to the APP (see Tischer (2018)). 
Moreover, valuation adjustments may occur in the re-
maining bond holdings, provided that these are 
entered in the balance sheet at current market prices. 
However, such an effect – especially one that would 
have led to lower valuations of government bonds 
over the APP horizon, causing the treatment defi  nition 
to become distorted – is of little signifi  cance to banks 
domiciled in Germany.
4 Sensitivity analyses show that the estimated effects 
are not qualitatively dependent on the exact defi  nition 
of this threshold value. A higher threshold value does, 
however, also increase the probability that a change in 
stocks (of government bond holdings) was, in fact, 
caused by net sales or redemptions (without reinvest-
ment) above and beyond the usual volume over the 
observation horizon.Deutsche Bundesbank

growth.5 Such characteristics include the 
size of the bank (measured as the logarithm 
of total assets) and the shares of overall 
securi tised lending, loans to non- fi  nancial 
corporations, deposits from the non- 
fi  nancial private sector and deposits from 
other enterprises and public sector entities 
in total assets. In addition, several measures 
from banks’ income statements are taken 
into account: return on equity before tax, 
allowances on loans, net interest income 
and staff costs. Furthermore, the treatment 
of the measure not being analysed at the 
time (i.e. participation in the APP when the 
TLTRO effect is being estimated and vice 
versa) is factored into the equation. The aim 
of taking bank characteristics into consider-
ation is to identify the effects of banks’ 
actual  participation in the measure as op-
posed to other infl  uences – including those 
that led them to participate. The impact es-
timated in this way covers both the direct 
and indirect effects of a measure on lending 
inasmuch as they are relevant to the partici-
pant bank.
To verify the reliability of the results, we use 
two different estimation procedures: fi  rst, 
the propensity score (PS) estimation and 
second, the entropy balance (EB) proced-ure.6 The table above depicts the estimated 
effects of the two non- standard measures 
in question based on both variants. After 
statistical adjustment of the dataset for 
missing observations, this analysis uses 
monthly data on 1,398 banks domiciled in 
5 This is performed using the regression- adjusted 
matching approach (see Heckman et al. (1997)). For 
details on the estimation procedure, see Offermanns 
and Blaes (2020) as well as Blaes et al. (2019).
6 The PS approach explains a bank’s treatment status 
by using a probit function of the bank characteristics. 
A comparison of the probabilities of treatment pro-
jected by the model (known as the “propensity score”) 
then provides information on which banks in the con-
trol group (i.e. the banks not participating in a meas-
ure) resemble any one bank in the treatment group in 
terms of key bank characteristics. The subsequent 
weighting of individual banks in the control group is 
performed on the basis of how often a bank in the 
control group is deemed to be similar to a bank in the 
treatment group (see Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)). 
The alternative EB procedure does not specify a (linear) 
model for the treatment status and directly determines 
the share a bank in the control group requires when 
forming a weighted sample mean across all banks in 
the control group in order for this mean value to be as 
close as possible to the sample mean of the treatment 
group (see Hainmueller (2012)). The advantage of this 
procedure over the PS method is that it balances not 
only the one- dimensional treatment status criterion 
between the two groups of banks but also all bank 
characteristics in question using a multidimensional 
approach. Ultimately, both methods are designed to 
ensure that the weighted sample mean values of the 
bank characteristics are as balanced as possible be-
tween the treatment group and the control group; this 
is known as covariate balancing.Treatment effects of non-standard monetary policy measures

Germany from January 2008 to May 2019 
as a starting point.
The results suggest that the banks con-
cerned reacted to both the TLTRO and the 
APP by expanding their lending to non- 
fi  nancial corporations.7 The estimated co-
effi   cients imply that, on average over the 
evaluation period, the monthly loan growth 
rate of a bank participating in the TLTRO is 
0.26 to 0.27 percentage point higher than 
that of a non- participant bank with other-
wise the same characteristics. The differ-
ence for the APP is within a similar range, 
i.e. between 0.26 and 0.30  percentage 
point.8
The identifi  ed effects differ between the 
analysed groups of banks. The group con-
sisting of savings banks and credit coopera-
tives, which have a similar business model 
and occupy a leading position in the market 
in the fi  eld of loans to enterprises (meas-
ured by market share), exhibits a TLTRO- 
induced difference in the point estimate of 
the loan growth rate of around 0.22 per-
centage point and is signifi  cantly different 
from zero, whereas the APP- induced effect 
for this group is close to zero. On the other 
hand, the estimation suggests that the 
group consisting of commercial banks,9 
which have a different business model and 
refi  nancing structure to that of savings 
banks and credit cooperatives but likewise 
occupy a strong market position in the 
credit segment in question, reacted more 
strongly to the APP stimulus. The corres-
ponding evidence on the effects of the 
TLTRO is mixed for this group of banks, 
which is why caution is warranted when in-
terpreting these effects.
From a qualitative perspective, it can be 
concluded from this comparison that sav-
ings banks and credit cooperatives re-
sponded more strongly to the TLTRO than to the APP by increasing the volume of 
loans granted, whereas the APP contrib-
uted more decisively to commercial banks 
expanding their lending activity.
Another interesting insight regarding het-
erogeneity in the banking sector is illus-
trated in the chart on p. 29. It shows the 
effects of the TLTRO and the APP on Ger-
man banks’ lending to non- fi  nancial cor-
porations over time. The effects are shown 
through differences in the average growth 
rates of loans to non- fi  nancial corporations 
granted by banks participating in the TLTRO 
and the APP and a control group of banks 
not participating in the respective meas-
ure.10 According to the chart, the TLTRO 
exerted a positive impact on participant 
banks’ average loan growth rates from the 
7 The results shown in the table on p. 27 remain quali-
tatively unchanged if, instead of lending to non- 
fi  nancial corporations in the euro area, the focus lies 
on lending to non- fi  nancial corporations domiciled in 
Germany.
8 The estimated effects do not change if the estima-
tion additionally incorporates the banks’ excess re-
serves, which have increased substantially over time. 
Given that these excess reserves were remunerated at 
negative interest rates in the treatment period, they 
represent one aspect – in a cross- sectional comparison 
of banks – of the negative interest rate policy put in 
place simultaneously with the quantitative non- 
standard measures (see also Demiralp et al. (2017)). 
The robustness of the depicted estimation results to 
the inclusion of excess reserves thus suggests that 
these are not attributable to any effects emanating 
from the negative interest rate policy.
9 The remaining 60 banks exhibit a high level of het-
erogeneity, making it impossible to draw conclusions 
on the specifi  cs of this group. The number of observa-
tions required for the estimation is insuffi   cient for a 
further decomposition into homogeneous sub- groups.
10 The average growth rates of the non- participant 
banks are calculated as a weighted mean, with the 
weights being derived from the fi  rst stage of the esti-
mation outlined above. The aim of weighting the 
group of non- participating banks is to be able to com-
pare this group of banks with the treatment group; the 
difference in the average credit growth rates can 
therefore be put down to participation in the relevant 
measure. To facilitate better interpretation, the calcu-
lated difference in the average growth rates is cumu-
lated over time and normalised to zero in May 2014, 
i.e. the last month before the fi  rst TLTRO was an-
nounced. The vertical lines highlight the months of 
June 2014 (announcement of TLTRO I) and January 
2015 (announcement that the existing purchase pro-
grammes would be expanded).Deutsche Bundesbank

TLTROs showed far greater variation in the 
amounts they borrowed.
The results of the microdata estimation pre -
sented in the box on p. 26 ff. suggest that, on 
average between 2014 and 2019, a bank in 
Germany participating in the TLTROs registered 
a higher growth rate in its loans to enterprises 
than a non- participating institution, all other 
things being equal. In addition, the results indi -
cate that the positive impact could mainly be 
traced back to the expansion of lending by sav -
ings banks and credit cooperatives. These two 
categories of bank run fairly similar business 
models. In corporate banking, they traditionally 
cater primarily for small and medium-  sized 
enterprises  in their region; taken together, they 
are therefore a market leader (measured by 
market share) in the field of loans to enter -
prises.
Overall, these results are largely in line with the 
available microdata evidence for the euro area as a whole. Afonso and Sousa- Leite (2019), 
Laine (2019) and Andreeva and García- Posada 
(2019), in particular, find that the TLTROs have 
mostly positive effects on bank lending in the 
euro area.25 The results presented in the box on 
pp. 26 ff. support the theory that the measure 
also buoyed loan developments in a country 
with less pronounced funding shortages in the 
banking system.
While the TLTROs were designed to keep finan -
cing conditions favourable for banks as a way 
of supporting the flow of credit to the private TLRTOs impact 
positively on 
lending, …… which chimes 
with the micro -
data evidence 
for the euro 
areastart, while the APP’s positive infl  uence on 
lending only became apparent with a cer-
tain time lag. If we take into account the 
estimation result which shows that the esti-
mated positive APP effect is mainly attribut-
able to commercial banks increasing their 
lending, it appears that – besides the differ-
ence in the primary monetary policy object-
ive – the identifi  ed differences in the indi-
vidual measures’ impact intensity are also 
linked to the heterogeneity among banks. 
This result supports the fi  nding for the euro 
area reported in the literature that a num-
ber of banks initially used the funds from 
the APP to clean up their balance sheets in 
order to increase their lending in the fu-
ture.11 It is also largely consistent with BLS 
data, which indicate that the expansionary 
stimulus of the APP – unlike in the case of 
the TLTRO – was only transmitted to higher 
lending volumes among the surveyed banks 
with a certain time lag. 11 See Blaes et al. (2019).Effects of TLTRO and APP on lending by

25 The first studies on the effects of non- standard monet -

ducted in December 2011 for the first time (and again in 
February 2012). The aim of these operations was to sup -

non- financial sector, the APP was the prime in -
strument for a broad- based further loosening 
of the monetary policy stance from 2015 to 
2018.26 In contrast to conventional interest rate 
policy, the APP’s primary transmission channels 
were via price and yield adjustments to individ -
ual asset classes and via the flattening of the 
yield curve.27
The estimations presented on pp.  26 ff. use 
changes in banks’ securities- based lending to 
general government in the euro area as a proxy 
for their participation in the APP . A proxy vari -
able is needed because of the lack of micro -
data on direct sales of securities to the Eurosys -
tem. A bank is considered to have “partici -
pated” in the APP if, accord ing to the monthly 
balance sheet statistics, it made sizeable reduc -
tions to its holdings of government bonds be -
tween January 2015 and May 2019.
Looking at the microdata of banks in Germany, 
overall just under 40% of banks reduced their holdings of government bonds in this period 
(see the above table). Commercial banks ac -
counted for a relatively large share of the re -
duction in holdings, which was distributed rela -
tively evenly across institutions of this category 
of bank. Savings banks and cooperative banks, 
by contrast, were responsible for a relatively 
small share of the reduction overall, at just 
under 7%. German banks reduced their gov -
ernment bond holdings fairly substantially over -
all compared to banks in other euro area coun -
tries.
The estimations in the table on p. 27 indicate 
that banks participating in the APP expanded 
their lending to non- financial corporations to a 
greater extent than non- participating banks.

measure are unevenly spread across the indi -

the TLTROs. In this case, the APP contributed to 
an expansion in lending primarily at commer -
cial banks. One likely reason for this is that 
these banks had relatively large government 
bond holdings prior to the start of the APP , 
which meant they benefited disproportionately 
from the APP . The estimated APP effects on 
savings banks and credit cooperatives are insig -
nificant, by contrast. The relatively small reduc -
tion in these institutions’ government bond 
holdings are consistent with this observation.
Overall, these results fit in with the microdata 
studies on APP effects that are already available 
for Germany. For example, Tischer (2018) and 
Paludkiewicz (2018) show that banks domiciled 
in Germany which saw the yield- reducing ef -
fects of the APP crimp returns on their secur -
ities portfolios stepped up their lending to the 
private non- financial sector or to non- banks 
significantly. At the same time, the results pre -
sented in the box on pp.  26 ff. support the 
existing body of evidence for the euro area. For 
example, Albertazzi et al. (2018) and Altavilla et 
al. (2018) find that loans to the private non-  
financial sector or non- financial corporations 
grew at a higher rate at banks in the euro area 
that participated in the APP than it did at banks 
that did not. However, Blaes et al. (2019) only 
identify this effect in the euro area for finan -
cially sound banks, which leads them to con -
clude that heterogeneity among banks needs 
to be taken into account when evaluating 
monetary policy.
Taken together, the microdata analyses pre -
sented above indicate that both the TLTROs 
and the APP had a positive impact, on average, 
on lending among participating banks. While 
these estimates computed using microecono -
metric approaches have to be interpreted as 
representing only partial effects of the individ -
ual measures on banks’ lending behaviour, they 
nonetheless provide a nuanced picture of the 
effects of the individual non- standard monet -
ary policy measures, making them a very useful 
source of additional information alongside 
macroeconomic analyses.Analyses at the macro level
The comparison presented in the first part of 
this article (see pp. 18 f.) between the actual 
rate of loan growth and a forecast conditional 
on the business cycle and the lending rate does 
not allow any direct conclusions to be drawn 
about what contribution has been made by 
monetary policy and other macroeconomic fac -
tors to the unexpectedly high growth in loans 
to enterprises in recent years.28
In order to examine this question, the model 
needs to be expanded to include the identifica -
tion of macroeconomic shocks. The fundamen -
tal idea lies in decomposing the deviations of 
the observed developments from a forecast 
into the contributions of these shocks. In this 
context, a shock is an exogenous change to an 
economic determinant, i.e. a change that can -
not be explained from within the model. Unlike 
in the analysis on pp. 18 f., a simple dynamic 
forecast is taken as the baseline, which means 
it is not conditional on the development of cer -
tain variables (real GDP , the GDP deflator and 
the lending rate). This is because the prescribed 
path of these variables in the conditional fore -
cast can already contain part of the effects of 
the shocks that are to be identified. As already 
explained above, (standard and non- standard) 
monetary policy can affect loan growth through 
various transmission channels. The assumptions 
for the identification of the monetary policy 
shock therefore need to be kept sufficiently 
general.
The analysis described in more detail on pp. 32 ff. 
makes a distinction between aggregate supply 
and demand shocks, credit supply shocks and 
monetary policy shocks. A “shadow short rate” … which is in

reduced form of the model, without the identification of 
shocks being required. The economic shocks identified in 
the following model can be contained in both the condi -

Contributions of macroeconomic shocks to the forecast 
error for loan growth from 2014
The following analysis decomposes the 
forecast error for loan growth from the fi  rst 
quarter of 2014 into the contributions of in-
terpretable macroeconomic shocks. On the 
basis of information available as from the 
end of 2013, the analysis shows how an 
observer  would have assessed the role of 
these shocks in explaining the forecast 
errors occurring from 2014.
The analysis builds on the BVAR model for 
Germany described on pp. 18 f. Concerning 
the monetary policy reaction function, it is 
important that the model also contains real 
gross domestic product (GDP) and the GDP 
defl  ator for the euro area excluding Ger-
many in addition to the German variables. If 
these variables were excluded, it would be 
assumed that Eurosystem monetary policy 
reacted only to the German variables or 
that the development of the variables rele-
vant to monetary policy in Germany was 
representative of that in the euro area as a 
whole. However, economic developments 
in Germany differed considerably from 
those in the other Member States in the 
early 2000s and during the fi  nancial and 
sovereign debt crises and their aftermaths. 
If the variables for the rest of the euro area 
are excluded, the monetary policy reaction 
function of the Eurosystem contained in the 
model may possibly be incorrectly specifi  ed, 
which would lead to an erroneous assess-
ment of the monetary policy shocks.1
As described earlier, the monetary policy 
stance is measured using the shadow short 
rate proposed by Geiger and Schupp (2018). 
It is calculated from the yield curve and rep-
resents the notional short- term interest rate 
which would materialise in the absence of 
an effective lower bound on interest rates. 
This makes it possible to also take account of the impact of monetary policy measures 
at or close to the effective lower bound 
which are not or not completely refl  ected in 
changes to the short- term interest rate.2 
The use of the shadow short rate thus 
allows standard and non- standard monet-
ary policy to be jointly modelled. This is, 
however, under the assumption that the 
macroeconomic effects of a monetary policy- 
induced change in the shadow short rate 
on the model variables are independent 
of  the specifi  c monetary policy measure 
which induced the change.3 Moreover, the 
shadow short rate is a less accurate indica-
tor of the monetary policy stance than, say, 
a short- term interbank interest rate given 
standard monetary policy since it is also in-
fl  uenced by changes in the yield curve that 
were not caused by the Eurosystem’s mon-
etary policy. This inaccuracy increases the 
uncertainty associated with the estimation.
Sign restrictions are used to identify the 
economic shocks.4 They make assumptions 
about the direction of the immediate re-
sponses of the variables to the shocks. The 
assumptions used largely follow those in 
Mandler and Scharnagl (2019a). A total of 
four shocks are identifi  ed: an aggregate de-
mand shock, an aggregate supply shock or 
1 See also Mandler and Scharnagl (2019a).

Bundesbank (2017a).

United States, see Francis et al. (2014).

infl  ation shock, a loan supply shock and a 
monetary policy shock.5
A dynamic forecast of the model variables 
starting in the fi  rst quarter of 2014 is used 
as a baseline for the shock decomposition. 
This forecast is not conditional on the ob-
served values of one or more variables, 
since the realised values of the determining 
variables already show the result of eco-
nomic shocks.
The forecast errors, i.e. the gaps between 
the dynamic (unconditional) forecast and 
the realised values of the variables, are then 
decomposed into the contributions of the 
identifi  ed shocks and the unidentifi  ed re-
sidual shocks. The deviations of the realised 
values from the forecast can, alongside the 
effect of temporary shocks, also be the re-
sult of changes in the model coeffi   cients, 
i.e. represent structural breaks or gradual 
changes in the coeffi   cients. For this reason, 
the term “shocks” will be placed in inverted 
commas below.
The adjacent chart shows the results of the 
decomposition of the forecast errors for the 
annual growth rates of loans to non- 
fi  nancial corporations, of GDP and of the 
5 For an interpretation of the loan supply shock, see 
Mandler and Scharnagl (2019a). The aggregate de-
mand shock causes German GDP and the GDP defl  a-
tor, the shadow short rate and the German govern-
ment bond yield to rise. The supply shock causes Ger-
man GDP to drop, and the German price level, the 
shadow short rate and the German government bond 
yield to rise. A loan supply shock has a positive effect 
on German GDP , the loan volume and the shadow 
short rate, while the lending rate falls. For a discussion 
of these restrictions, particularly the absence of a re-
striction on the price level response, see Mandler and 
Scharnagl (2019a) as well as Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2015d). The monetary policy shock leads to an in-
crease in the shadow short rate and the German gov-
ernment bond yield, while GDP and the price level in 
Germany and in the rest of the euro area decrease. In 
addition, it is assumed that the contemporaneous co-
effi   cients of both gross domestic products and price 
levels are positive in the structural monetary policy re-
action function. All sign restrictions apply contempor-
aneously.Decomposition of forecast errors into

GDP defl  ator, and for the lending rate. For 
this purpose, the results for the levels of the 
fi  rst three variables were converted into 
growth rates.6
The bars show the median of the contribu-
tion of the respective “shock” to the fore-
cast error. The outermost light blue bar rep-
resents the contributions of the unidentifi  ed 
“shocks”.7 The black line is the sum of the 
bars.
The results show positive contributions of 
“monetary policy shocks” to the growth of 
GDP , the GDP defl  ator and loans, as well as 
negative contributions to the lending rate. 
While only the median of the posterior dis-
tribution of the contributions is shown in 
the chart, the entire distribution of the con-
tributions of the “shocks” must be exam-
ined to assess the weight of the statistical 
evidence. A simple metric useful for this is 
the ratio between the probabilities of a 
positive and of a negative contribution of 
the “monetary policy shock” to loan growth 
that can be calculated based on the simu-
lated probability distribution. This ratio ex-
ceeds a value of 2:1 from the fourth quarter 
of 2016. It is more pronounced for the 
growth rate of real GDP , for which it ex-
ceeds a value of 3:1 from 2014 up to and 
including 2016. For the growth rate of the 
GDP defl  ator, the results show positive stim-
uli provided by monetary policy over the en-
tire forecast period. The delayed positive 
contributions to loan growth as compared 
with real GDP refl  ect the known lag of loans 
behind GDP .
According to the estimation, “loan supply 
shocks” associated with an increase in the 
loan volume, a decline in the lending rate 
and a rise in real GDP were major drivers of 
loan growth in 2017 and 2018.8 Of the two 
other identifi  ed shocks, the model attrib-
utes only “aggregate demand shocks” with a certain role in explaining the increasing 
loan growth at the end of the forecast 
period. However, a probability ratio of 2:1 
for a positive contribution of this shock is 
not provided by the model until the second 
quarter of 2019. Consistent with the lag of 
loans behind real GDP , the positive contri-
bution of the “demand shocks” to GDP 
growth is evident at an earlier point in time.
Only roughly half of the comparatively large 
deviation of the rate of loan growth from 
the unconditional model forecast at the end 
of the forecast period is explained by the 
identifi  ed “shocks”. This could mean that 
other, not explicitly identifi  ed shocks were 
relatively important for loan growth or that 
there is a structural change in the loan 
equation in comparison with the estimation 
period and the deviations caused by this do 
not fi  t the pattern of one of the specifi  ed 
shocks.9
The continued positive contributions of 
“monetary policy shocks” to real GDP , the 
price level and loans suggest a structural 
change in the monetary policy reaction 
function in comparison with the estimation 
period. This is supported by the posterior 
distribution of the “structural monetary pol-
icy shocks” extracted from the model (not 
shown here) for the period from 2014 on-
6 In this context, the forecast errors contain only 
effects  of “shocks” from the starting point of the 
analysis . The effects of shocks from the past are part of 
the baseline by way of the starting conditions of the 
forecast.
7 To be precise, it constitutes the sum of the medians 
of the fi  ve unidentifi  ed shocks.
8 For this period, the above- mentioned probability 
ratio for a positive contribution to loan growth is at 
least 2:1.
9 If one estimates the model until the second quarter 
of 2019 and then carries out the above- described de-
composition of the (ex post) forecast error, the extent 
of the forecast error is reduced at the current end as 
expected; however, the identifi  ed shocks still explain 
only roughly half of the forecast error. This sensitivity 
analysis therefore tends to point more strongly to the 
fi  rst of the two explanations mentioned above.Deutsche Bundesbank

wards, which is primarily in negative, i.e. 
expansionary, territory. According to the 
model, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
stance as measured using the shadow short 
rate was, on average, more expansionary 
after 2014 than would have been expected 
based on the monetary policy reaction 
function estimated over the period before. 
However, when viewed in isolation, this 
does not necessarily mean that the monet-
ary policy stance was excessively expansion-
ary. A number of analyses use structural 
macroeconomic models and an effective 
zero lower bound for the policy rate to 
argue that the central bank should pursue a 
more expansionary monetary policy at or 
close to the effective zero lower bound 
than their “normal” monetary policy reac-
tion function would imply.10
The model results depend upon a number 
of assumptions, including identifi  cation as-
sumptions regarding the shocks’ character-
istics, the estimation period and the starting 
point of the forecast. The selection of the 
shadow short rate also has an impact, with 
various models existing for its estimation, 
which result in sometimes considerably di-
vergent time series for the shadow short 
rate.11 For example, using the shadow short 
rate proposed by Wu and Xia (2016) leads 
to somewhat larger contributions of “mon-
etary policy shocks” to loan growth.10 Nakata (2017) shows in a New Keynesian model 
that an increase in uncertainty surrounding macroeco-
nomic shocks at or close to the zero lower bound 
leads to a decline in infl  ation and output growth. This 
is because of the asymmetry, resulting from the zero 
lower bound, in the central bank’s capacity to counter-
act expansionary or restrictive shocks. In the analysis 
by Basu and Bundick (2015), approaching the zero 
lower bound and the resulting reduced capacity of the 
central bank to counteract future negative shocks lead 
to an endogenous increase in uncertainty that has a 
contractionary effect. They recommend that the cen-
tral bank therefore keeps the monetary policy rates 
low for longer than would be the case in its normal 
reaction function. See also Evans et al. (2015). Certain 
risks of a highly expansionary monetary policy stance, 
e.g. to fi  nancial stability, are not explicitly analysed in 
these models. Existing work on these risks has fre-
quently been of a partial- analytical nature, meaning 
that their quantitative signifi  cance is diffi   cult to gauge.
11 Examples of differing calculation methods are: 
Geiger  and Schupp (2018); Krippner (2013); Lemke 
and Vladu (2017); as well as Wu and Xia (2016).Deutsche Bundesbank

is used in the model as an indicator for monet -
ary policy. It serves as a composite indicator for 
the monetary policy stance and is responsive to 
both standard and non- standard monetary pol -
icy measures, provided these have effects on 
the yield curve.29
The chart on p. 33 contains the results of the 
analysis for the annual growth rates of loans to 
non- financial corporations and real GDP . The 
starting point for the forecast is, as previously, 
the first quarter of 2014. The analysis shows, 
on the basis of information available at the end 
of 2013, how an observer would assess the role 
played by the various macroeconomic shocks 
in explaining the forecast errors occurring as of 
2014. The median of the contributions of the 
respective shocks to the forecast error is shown 
in each case by the different coloured bars.
The charts show that the monetary policy 
shocks made quantitatively substantial contri -
butions to the growth in real GDP , particularly 
over the period 2014 to 2016.30 The expansion -
ary contributions of monetary policy shocks 
feed through to loan growth with a certain 
delay, which is likely to reflect the usual lag of 
loans behind real activity.31 Looking at the 
probability distribution of the contribution of 
monetary policy shocks to loan growth, there is 
a probability ratio of at least 2:1 for a positive 
contribution as of the end of 2016.
Positive contributions to loan growth were also 
made by aggregate demand shocks and credit 
supply shocks. However, the effect of aggre -
gate demand shocks appears only as of 2018 
and reflects the lagged effect of the shocks 
that had a positive impact on real GDP growth 
in 2017. Credit supply shocks, which cover a 
broad spectrum of shocks in the financial sec -
tor affecting the loan supply, play a role in 2017 
and 2018. Overall, the contributions of the four 
shocks identified here explain roughly half of 
the forecast error at the current end. The rest 
of the forecast error is caused by other shocks 
that are not explicitly identified or may indicate 
a structural change in the loan equation.The fact that the indicator for the monetary 
policy stance used in the model only responds 
to monetary policy measures to the extent that 
they have an impact on the yield curve is im -
portant for the results. Monetary policy instru -
ments such as the APP , forward guidance or 
changes to policy rates do influence the shape 
of the yield curve and are consequently re -
flected in changes in the shadow short rate. 
For the TLTROs, however, a correlation with the 
yield curve is less clear- cut: if they did not have 
the effect of lowering the shadow short rate, 
their effect could have fed into the credit sup -
ply shocks or into the unidentified shocks ra -
ther than the monetary policy shocks.
In addition, there are various approaches to 
calculating the shadow short rate, each yield -
ing different paths for the variable.32 The re -
sults of the analysis consequently depend not 
only on the sample period and the starting 
point of the forecast, but also on the shadow 
short rate used.
Overall, this macroeconomic analysis suggests 
that monetary policy made a moderate contri -
bution to the deviation of loan growth from 
the model relationships valid prior to 2014, as 
seen from a 2013 perspective. However, the es -
timated effects of the monetary policy shocks 
shown in the chart on p. 33 only include the 
impact of deviations from the estimated mon -
etary policy reaction function; in other words, 
they take no account of the effects of monet -Unconditional

30 As explained on p. 33, the “shocks” can also be caused 
by changes in the model structure between the estimation

 Example of a counterfactual analysis to estimate the 
overall effect of non- standard monetary policy measures 
on credit growth
The analysis on pp. 32 ff. shows the effects 
of the identifi  ed monetary policy shocks on 
credit growth. These shocks can be inter-
preted as deviations by the shadow short 
rate from the monetary policy reaction 
function. The reaction function describes 
how the shadow short rate responds to the 
current and lagged values of the other vari-
ables. It represents the systematic part of 
monetary policy, while the shocks consti-
tute the unsystematic part. One way of 
examining the impact of systematic monet-
ary policy on credit growth is to simulate a 
model- based counterfactual scenario posit-
ing a different systematic monetary policy 
which can then be compared with the ac-
tual developments observed in reality.
The highly simplifi  ed illustrative example 
presented here builds on the Bayesian VAR 
model (see pp.  32 ff.) The model is esti-
mated up to the second quarter of 2019. 
The four macroeconomic shocks mentioned 
earlier are again identifi  ed by means of sign 
restrictions.1 The simulation of the counter-
factual scenario begins in the second quar-
ter of 2014, that is to say prior to the meas-
ures adopted by the Governing Council of 
the ECB at its 5 June 2014 meeting.2 From 
then on, dynamic simulations incorporating 
a lower bound for the shadow short rate 
are computed up to the second quarter of 
2019. This lower bound is set equal to the 
shadow short rate at the close of the fi  rst 
quarter of 2014 minus 25 basis points. The 
25 basis points are intended to capture the 
scope for conventional interest rate cuts 
which still existed at that time.3 The simula-
tion also includes all of the macroeconomic 
(identifi  ed and unidentifi  ed) shocks esti-
mated for the simulation period with the exception of the monetary policy shock, 
which is factored out.
In this way, the counterfactual scenario is 
designed to model a fi  ctitious macroeco-
nomic development: the historic macroeco-
nomic shocks impact on the economy while 
monetary policy is constrained by the ef-
fective lower bound on interest rates and 
no non- standard measures (beyond those 
already adopted up to that point) are de-
ployed. No account is taken of the fact that 
alternative policy regimes would entail dif-
ferent model coeffi   cients as expectations 
are adjusted accordingly (the “Lucas cri-
tique”).4
In technical terms, implementing the simu-
lation involves calculating a one- step fore-
cast for each quarter on the basis of the 
initial conditions or simulated values for the 
preceding period. This forecast is then ad-
justed for the effects of the shocks esti-
mated for the quarter in question. If this 
results in a shadow short rate below the 
specifi  ed lower bound, the shadow short 
rate is brought up to the lower bound by 
means of a restrictive monetary policy 
shock.5 This also induces changes in the val-

the second quarter of 1996 to the second quarter of 
2019 since the purpose of the analysis is an ex post 
evaluation of the unconventional monetary policy.

TLTROs, preparations for further ABS purchases and 
the extension of full allotment for refi  nancing oper-
ations.
3 The interest rate on the main refi  nancing operations 
was 0.25% from November 2013.
4 See Lucas (1976).
5 It is assumed here that all non- standard monetary 
policy measures are refl  ected in the shadow short rate. 
Baumeister and Benati (2013) and Mandler and Shar-
nagl (2019b) employ monetary policy shocks to pre-
vent the policy rate reacting to the expansionary effect 
of a central bank’s asset purchase programme.Deutsche Bundesbank

ues of the other variables. If, however, the 
simulated value for the shadow short rate is 
higher than or equal to the lower bound, 
no further adjustment is made. This proced-
ure yields a hypothetical probability distri-
bution for all the variables of the model at 
every point in the simulation period.
The simulated values for the level of loans 
are then converted into annual growth 
rates and compared with the annual growth 
rates actually observed. The difference be-
tween the growth rate observed in reality 
and the simulated growth rate represents 
an estimate for the effect of the actual 
monetary policy, that is to say, the esti-
mated reaction function and the monetary 
policy shocks compared with the alternative 
scenario in which no further non- standard 
monetary policy measures were deployed. 
In the example presented here, we obtain 
the biggest median effect in 2018, amount-
ing to 1.8%.6 There is a high degree of un-
certainty attached to this estimation. The 
16th percentile of the estimated effect 
stands at -0.2% and the 84th percentile lies 
at 5%.
The analysis presented here is of a primarily 
illustrative nature. The results depend upon 
a number of assumptions, including (but 
not limited to) the shadow short rate se-
lected, the lower bound defi  ned, the way 
the lower bound is implemented in the 
simulations with the aid of monetary policy 
shocks, and modelling in the form of a vec-
tor autoregression. Applying the shadow 
short rate of Wu and Xia (2016) yields larger 
effects, for example.
Implementing the effective lower bound on 
interest rates using monetary policy shocks 
assumes that the lower bound always be-
comes binding for economic agents unex-
pectedly. However, after a major contrac-
tionary shock that takes the economy to the lower bound, the economic agents in 
the counterfactual scenario should, for a 
certain period of time, anticipate that the 
central bank cannot supply any further ex-
pansionary impulses.
Furthermore, the simple time series model 
does not incorporate any explicit modelling 
of expectation channels. The adjustment of 
expectations to a lower bound that is bind-
ing over several periods could, for instance, 
contribute to a further decline in output 
and prices. Conversely, however, the ex-
pectation that the economy will return to 
its balanced path of growth and infl  ation in 
the long term – i.e. once the effect of all 
shocks has worn off – should have a stabil-
ising effect.

ary policy’s endogenous, systematic response 
to the state of the economy.
The overall effect of monetary policy measures, 
including their systematic components, can 
only be estimated with the help of counterfac -
tual simulations, which describe how the econ -
omy would have developed had these meas -
ures not been taken. The results of such an 
analysis, which assumes an alternative scenario 
for monetary policy, are naturally associated 
with a high degree of uncertainty and depend 
on a large number of modelling decisions and 
assumptions regarding the alternative scenario. 
A simple illustrative example based on the as -
sumption of a lower bound for the shadow 
short rate is described on pp. 37 f. According to 
this application, the contribution that the non- 
standard monetary policy measures made to 
loan growth was largest in mid-  2018, at just 
under 2  percentage points; the uncertainty 
interval was between 5 and -0.2 percentage 
points.33 In line with the analyses on pp. 26 ff., 
the example shows that non- standard monet -
ary policy had a positive effect on loan devel -
opments in Germany, but also underscores the 
associated high estimation uncertainty.
Conclusion
The broad- based and steep upswing in German 
banks’ loans to non- financial corporations in 
Germany from 2014 onwards can be explained 
only in part by the ongoing recovery of the 
German economy and the reduced costs of 
credit financing. Another key factor was the 
Eurosystem’s non- standard monetary policy 
measures introduced from 2014, which had a 
positive impact on loan dynamics over and 
above the pure effect of lowering interest rates. 
There are, moreover, a number of other influ -
ences on the supply of and demand for credit 
that are partially related to monetary policy.
On the demand side, it is striking that the ex -
pansion in lending was driven more by con -
struction and real estate enterprises, which are typically more loan- intensive than enterprises in 
other sectors, than was the case in earlier credit 
booms. These enterprises needed more funds 
as a result of lively construction activity and ris -
ing prices for construction work and real estate 
in recent years.
Other demand aspects include shifts in enter -
prises’ funding structure, including reduced 
scope for internal financing and better capital 
levels at enterprises. These factors drove up 
their demand for external finance and conse -
quently also for loans.
On the credit supply side, repeated easing of 
banks’ lending policies represented positive 
stimuli. This easing was related to intense com -
petition in the banking sector, which in turn 
must be seen against the backdrop of the on -
going low interest rate environment and 
ratcheted up pressure on banks’ margins and 
net interest income.
Empirical studies at the micro and macro level 
lend credence to the impression gained from 
all these factors that the Eurosystem’s non-  
standard monetary policy overall had a positive 
effect on developments in loans to enterprises 
in Germany. Macroeconomic analyses, for in -
stance, indicate that the positive overall effect 
of the measures carried out as of 2014 goes 
beyond the isolated effect of lower lending 
rates and the improved economic situation. An 
analysis based on bank- level data suggests that 
both the TLTROs and the APP resulted in par -
ticipating banks experiencing a higher growth 
rate for corporate loans on average in 2014 to 
2019 than non- participating banks, all other 
things being equal.

source of funding, making lending a significant 
variable within the monetary policy transmis -
sion process. Besides the finding that the non- 
standard monetary policy measures conducted 
since 2014 had a positive impact on lending, 
the question consequently also arises as to 
what risks could potentially result. In recent 
years, cyclical systemic risks have increasingly 
built up in the German financial system.34 The 
Eurosystem is observing these risks from a monetary policy perspective, alongside other 
aspects. It is, however, up to macroprudential 
policy to deploy its toolkit in response to these 
risks. This is one of the reasons why the Federal 
Financial Supervisory Authority activated the 
countercyclical capital buffer for the first time 
in mid- 2019.Upswing in 
loans could be 
associated with 
risks that finan -

Consequences of increasing protectionism
In some parts of the world, protectionist tendencies are on the rise once more. This is particularly 
true of the United States, which has adopted a more restrictive trade policy stance in recent times. 
By imposing additional tariffs on China and other trading partners, the US Administration hopes 
to win trade concessions as well as to strengthen its own economy and boost domestic employ -
ment.
However, following the escalation of the US- China trade dispute, there has been a decrease not 
only in US imports from China but also in US exports to China. In addition, there have been no 
indications to date that the United States has either substituted its imports from China with third- 
country imports or increased domestic production of these goods on a large scale. Chinese 
exporters do not appear to have made any substantial price concessions, either. All of this sug -
gests that neither the US economy nor US consumers have benefited from the realignment of the 
country’s trade policy thus far.
Furthermore, the empirical evidence indicates that no “lucky bystanders” have profited as yet 
from the dispute between the United States and China. While trade diversion effects appear to 
have been largely non- existent, trade policy disputes are likely to have exacerbated uncertainty 
worldwide. This, in turn, has probably put additional strain on investment and thus global eco -
nomic activity. Should an all- out trade war break out between the United States and the Euro -
pean Union, the consequences for the global economy could be far graver still.
Counteracting protectionist efforts would require the rules- based trading system, with the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) at its core, to be strengthened. This involves amending rules with a 
view to improving the protection of intellectual property and addressing the way in which it deals 
with state- owned enterprises. However, the success of such an ambitious push for reform depends 
on the constructive participation of all WTO members. Trade agreements such as those concluded 
on an ever more frequent basis by the European Union in recent times are only an imperfect sub -
stitute for a functioning multilateral order.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
As part of its “America First” strategy, the US 
Administration under President Trump has 
adopted a tougher trade policy stance, particu -
larly towards China. The conflict between the 
two largest economies in the world has escal -
ated dramatically over the course of the past 
two years: additional tariffs implemented by 
the United States were countered with retali -
atory measures from China, in turn prompting 
further US tariffs. The US Administration has 
gone on the trade offensive against other trad -
ing partners, too, even close political allies such 
as the European Union.
Protectionist tendencies are on the rise once 
more in other countries, too. Aside from tariffs, 
non- tariff barriers to trade, such as restrictions 
on government procurement and subsidies, are 
being utilised to a greater extent. According to 
the Global Trade Alert database, which records 
a broad spectrum of trade policy restrictions, 
many more measures have been registered 
worldwide in the past two years than previ -
ously.1
Rising protectionism in many parts of the world 
represents a turning point for international 
trade policy, which for decades had, conversely, 
been shaped by efforts to increase liberalisa -tion. In that setting, a series of formerly non-  
market emerging and developing economies 
successfully integrated into the international 
division of labour. Technological progress and 
decreasing communication and transport costs 
further promoted the process of globalisation. 
As a result of these developments, world trade 
experienced rampant growth.2
When emerging economies entered the mar -
ket, consumers in industrial countries obtained 
access to cheaper goods and a wider range of 
products. At the same time, increasing compe -
tition from foreign rivals drove structural 
change forward in many parts of the world. In 
particular, low earners with limited geograph -
ical and sectoral mobility suffered job and in -
come losses.3 In some instances, economic and 
social policy reforms that could have facilitated 
the adjustment process were neglected.
Above and beyond negative employment ef -
fects, some advocates of a more restrictive 
trade policy also use the large, persistent bal -
ances on national current accounts to justify 
their stance. The present US Administration, for 
instance, views the extensive surplus and deficit 
positions as proof of an uneven distribution of 
the current world trading system’s benefits. 
Specifically, exception has been taken to the 
high US-  China bilateral trade deficit, deemed 
by the United States to have been achieved Tightening of

2 Trend growth in global trade flattened out to a significant 
extent more recently – prior to the current rise in protec -
tionist tendencies, even. This is partly due to the slowdown 
in global economic growth. However, the lower trade in -
tensity of economic growth in China, which was linked to 
its evolution from a “small” to a “large” economy, also 
played a role here. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).

through “unfair” trading practices.4 However, 
current account balances reflect saving and in -
vestment decisions, first and foremost, and 
cannot be labelled as either good or bad with -
out first analysing the reasons behind them.5 
Moreover, bilateral balances should be inter -
preted with particular caution as they also re -
flect differing national production and demand 
patterns.6
How tariffs work
By imposing additional tariffs, the United States 
hopes to win trade concessions from its part -
ner countries and bring down its trade deficits, 
as well as strengthen its own economy and 
boost domestic employment. This view is based 
on the notion that a tariff acts like a tax on im -
ported goods, making domestically produced 
goods more competitive. However, an import 
substitution such as this presupposes that do -
mestic enterprises are able to manufacture 
goods that could be considered substitutes. If 
tariffs target a specific country, as is the case 
with the additional tariffs imposed on Chinese 
goods by the United States, consumers may 
also switch to similar products from other 
countries. The easier it is to substitute a prod -
uct subject to tariffs with another product pro -
duced domestically or by a third country, the 
more price- elastic the demand for that product 
will be. In the long term, such elasticities are 
typically fairly high (see the box on pp. 48 f.), 
but often tend to be rather low in the short 
term as tapping into new procurement and 
sales channels requires time and money.7
Taken in isolation, a tariff increases the prices 
of imported goods for the domestic popula -
tion. This reduces the purchasing power of 
households and enterprises and has a tendency 
to dampen domestic demand.8 However, im -
port tariffs may put foreign providers under 
pressure to reduce export prices, particularly in 
the case of goods with high trade elasticity. The 
price- increasing effect would then be lower.9 
This would also be the case if imposing tariffs resulted in an appreciation of the domestic cur -
rency.10
The domestic export industry is usually one of 
the victims of tariff increases. This is immedi -
ately apparent when trading partners retaliate 
by likewise increasing tariffs. In addition, a cur -
rency appreciation triggered by tariffs would 
erode price competitiveness in the international 
markets. Tariffs on foreign intermediate goods 
are particularly damaging to the domestic 
economy as they make domestic production 
more costly (see the box on pp. 52 ff.).
Overall, therefore, there is much to suggest 
that raising import tariffs hardly leaves an econ -
omy as a whole better off in the short term. 
Detrimental effects can be expected to pre -
dominate in the medium and long term, at the 
latest, as the decline in competitive inten  sity 
associated with increasing insularity tends to 
weaken domestic productivity growth.11 In add -Tariffs as a type

4 The United States accuses China of violating intellectual 
property rights, restricting market access for foreign enter -
prises and subsidising domestic enterprises, in particular. 
Other trading partners of China, such as the European 
Union, agree with some of these points. However, the 
European Union’s measures comply with the WTO’s rules, 
which include the targeted use of trade defence instru -
ments such as anti- dumping tariffs. See European Commis -
sion (2019).
5 For a more in- depth discussion, see Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2017).
6 Furthermore, US imports from China specifically also con -
tain a certain amount of value added from other econ -
omies, not least from the United States itself. Regarding the 
US trade deficit with the European Union, it should be 
borne in mind that this is compensated for by other com -
ponents of the current account, particularly investment in -
come. This is how the United States has actually recorded 
a consistent current account surplus with the European 
Union since 2009, according to official US statistics.
7 See, for example, Crucini and Davis (2016).
8 If the government passes on tariff revenue to domestic 
economic agents (in the form of tax cuts, for example), this 
effect is muted.
9 This is particularly true when the country imposing the 
tariffs is large and thus able to influence the world market 
price with its demand. Part of the tariff burden can then be 
passed on to the exporting country.
10 Appreciation can be the result of decreased demand for 
foreign currency owing to lower imports. It is equally con -
ceivable for a tightening of monetary policy in response to 
stronger domestic price pressures to be accompanied by an 
appreciation of the currency.

al. (2005). For a recent empirical study on this relationship,

Estimating long- run trade elasticities
When quantifying the consequences of 
trade policy measures, trade elasticities play 
an important role.1 Elasticity represents the 
relative change of a variable in relation to 
the relative change in another variable. 
Trade (cost) elasticities thus measure how 
imports respond to a change in trade costs.2 
They are directly linked to elasticities of sub-
stitution between products from various 
countries of origin. If trade elasticities are 
high, a rise in trade costs between two 
countries drives up volume effects consider-
ably, for one, as demand focuses more 
closely on domestic products or products 
from third countries.
Various methods can be used to estimate 
trade elasticities. Macroeconomic models, 
which are generally used to examine adjust-
ments of macroeconomic variables to tem-
porary shocks in the short to medium term, 
often yield relatively low values for trade 
elasticities. In more detailed trade models 
that investigate the impact of long- term 
political measures, such as free trade agree-
ments, elasticities are usually signifi  cantly 
higher.3 This is possibly because the options 
for substituting products are greater over 
the long term and among related products 
than over the short term and among broad 
product categories.
Structural gravity models, in particular, are 
used to estimate long- run trade elasticities.4 
These approaches model bilateral trade be-
tween two countries while focusing on vari-
ous determinants, such as the gross domes-
tic product of each trading partner as well 
as trading costs, both between the two 
economies as well as vis- à- vis third coun-
tries. Such models provide estimation equa-
tions that correlate bilateral trade fl  ows 
with tariffs and other –  sometimes time- invariant – restrictions, such as geograph-
ical distance between countries and lan-
guage barriers. This approach can also take 
trade agreements into account. As tariffs 
can be considered an essential exogenous 
determinant of trade costs, it is possible to 
use this method to estimate trade elastici-
ties.
Applying such an approach to annual data 
on international and intra- national trade 
fl  ows in the manufacturing sector in 45 
countries reveals that, for the period from 
1996 to 2015, the tariff variable has a highly 
signifi  cant negative impact on trade fl  ows,5 
and trade elasticity is estimated at -5.6
As an alternative to this procedure, Feenstra 
(1994) developed an estimation approach 
based on a model with imperfect competi-
tion and product varieties distinguished by 
country of origin.7 When applied to US for-
1 Arkolakis et al. (2012), for instance, show that for 
important trade models – such as those in Krugman 
(1980), Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Melitz (2003) – 
the welfare implications of trade liberalisation (or its 
reversal) hinge on the degree of trade elasticity.
2 In the stricter sense, trade costs are import duties 
and transport costs, for instance. In the broadest 
sense, they cover all barriers that restrict international 
trade, such as communication and fi  nancing costs as 
well as organisational expenses.
3 See Anderson and Yotov (2017).
4 See Head and Mayer (2014).
5 Data on the manufacturing sector’s trade ties are 
taken from the OECD’s TiVA database; see https://
www.oecd.org/sti/ind/measuring-trade-in- value- added.  
htm. Data on tariffs come from the WITS database; see 
https://wits.worldbank.org.
6 The estimation is calculated using a Poisson pseudo 
maximum likelihood approach; see Santos Silva and 
Tenreyro (2006). The estimated equation also takes ac-
count of indicator variables for free trade agreements, 
customs unions and common currencies.
7 In addition to estimating the product- specifi  c elasti-
city of import demand, the elasticity of export supply 
can also be quantifi  ed. The elasticities are derived as 
structural parameters from the estimated system of im-
port and export equations. See Feenstra (1994). This 
approach was expanded by Broda and Weinstein 
(2006) and Soderbery (2018).Deutsche Bundesbank

ition, it is unlikely that the current account will 
see a sustained improvement, as additional tar -
iffs also negatively affect a country’s own ex -
ports.
The adverse effects of an all- out trade conflict 
can easily extend beyond the countries directly 
involved. Although it is conceivable that some 
countries could benefit from trade diversion 
effects , most are likely to be hit, at least in the 
short to medium term, by decreased demand 
from the warring factions as a result of the 
trade dispute. Added to this is the fact that 
protectionist measures may increase economic 
uncertainty (see the box on pp. 57 ff.). This may 
cause enterprises to postpone their investment 
plans. Furthermore, global financing conditions 
may deteriorate on account of heightened un -
certainty.Effects of US trade policy 
measures to date
Trade dispute with China
The US- China trade dispute has escalated in 
stages over the past one and a half years. Ini -
tially, the United States only imposed additional 
tariffs on a small proportion of Chinese goods, 
to which China responded with countermeas -
ures. As the dispute escalated, both countries 
extended the imposition of tariffs to an ever 
greater share of each other’s imports or in -
creased the tariff rates on goods already sub -
ject to tariffs. While the US tariffs targeted 
intermediate and capital goods from China, 
China’s tariffs were focused primarily on capital 
goods and commodities. By the end of 2019, 
additional tariffs had been imposed on around 
two- thirds of the total volume of goods traded 
between the United States and China. In Janu -
ary 2020, both countries signed a “phase one” Third countries

affectedStages of 
escalation  of the 
trade disputeeign trade data for the period from 2000 to 
2017,8 this approach yields an average trade 
elasticity of just under -5, which corrobor-
ates the result obtained using the gravity 
model. The average trade elasticity for more 
disparate products amounts to -3½ and is 
thus much lower than for homogeneous 
goods such as commodities.
Overall, it can be demonstrated that the 
long- run trade elasticities are typically ra-
ther high. This implies that, over the long 
term, trade fl  ows respond signifi  cantly to 
changes in trade costs. In the short term, 
however, this applies to a limited extent 
only. It would thus appear that the full im-
pact of the sharp rise in bilateral trade costs 
in the trade dispute between the United 
States and China is yet to come.8 Elasticities were estimated based on Broda and 
Weinstein’s (2006) approach. The estimate used data 
on US imports of around 5,000 products (HS six- digit 
codes) and from more than 150 countries. Data 
source: UN Comtrade; see https://comtrade.un.org. To 
ensure that the estimations are as reliable as possible, 
a product has to have been traded for at least fi  ve 
years and imported from at least fi  ve countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

agreement to ease the trade dispute.12 How -
ever, the majority of the tariffs imposed will re -
main in force until further notice.
The trade flows between China and the United 
States have declined considerably since the 
onset of the trade dispute. After seasonal ad -
justment, the value of US imports of goods 
from China at the end of 2019 was more than 
one- fifth lower than it had been prior to the 
imposition of the first additional tariffs.13 US ex -
ports to China, the volume of which is admit -
tedly considerably lower, experienced a similar 
decline. The US trade deficit with China de -
creased to some extent. Nevertheless, its over -
all current account deficit relative to gross 
domes tic product (GDP) in the third quarter of 
2019 was exactly the same as at the start of 
2018.14
In order to identify the effects of the additional 
tariffs on US imports from China as precisely as 
possible, a detailed breakdown of trade flows 
into product groups is analysed.15 On this basis, 
imports subject to additional tariffs are ana -
lysed to determine whether they developed at 
a different rate to the remaining goods imports 
from China.16 The difference-  in- differences 
method is a suitable analytical framework for 
this purpose. Within this framework, the 
monthly year- on- year growth rate of the product- specific import value is regressed, inter 
alia, on an indicator variable that switches from 
zero to one in the month from which add -
itional tariffs are imposed on a product.17
The findings suggest that the decline in US im -
ports from China since the onset of the trade 
dispute is mainly attributable to the introduc -
tion of the additional tariffs. The value of im -
ports of goods subject to additional tariffs de -

from China of product p at time t. Tariff-Dummyp,t is the 
indicator variable, γp is a product- specific effect and γst is a 
sector- time- specific fixed effect. When analysing price ef -
fects and trade diversion effects, the dependent variable is 
changed accordingly and further control variables are 
added to the model. All analyses cover the period from 
January 2016 to May 2019. For a more detailed description

2019, whilst other imports held up compara -
tively well. On average, the difference between 
the annual rates of change for these two 
groups of products during this period totalled 
around 30 percentage points. Taking into ac -
count the fact that the imports concerned were 
subject to additional tariffs of 13%, on average, 
this implies an elasticity of approximately -2. As 
estimates for the long term point to signifi -
cantly greater elasticities (see the box on 
pp. 48 f.), this suggests that the adjustment was 
not yet complete, and that trade between the 
United States and China can be expected to 
continue declining if the additional tariffs re -
main in place.18
A similar approach can be used to investigate 
whether Chinese suppliers of products subject 
to additional tariffs were prepared to make 
price concessions to the United States. To 
examine this, developments in the prices at the 
customs border of such US imports – i.e. be -
fore any extra tariffs were applied – were com -
pared with those of other imports from China.19 
The results do not point to any systematic dif -
ferences.20 This indicates that the (gross) prices 
of the goods subject to additional tariffs in the 
United States probably rose, or that importers 
had to accept smaller margins. Therefore, as al -
ready suggested by the decline in US imports 
from China, the brunt of the tariffs has been 
borne to a very large extent by US enterprises 
and consumers – at least until May 2019.
This is consistent with the fact that the sub-  
indices in the US consumer price index (CPI) 
that were most affected by the additional tar -
iffs on consumer goods imports have shown 
relatively sharp increases in recent times.21 
However, since these sub- indices are only a 
small component of the CPI, the direct impact 
on the headline inflation rate was moderate.22 
Nonetheless, the additional tariffs primarily 
affected   intermediate goods. There could 
therefore have been other price effects that are 
less easy to identify.Using the difference- in- differences method, we 
can also investigate whether the imports from 
China subject to additional tariffs have been 
substituted by imports from third countries. To 
do so, we analyse whether US imports from 
third countries of products subject to additional 
tariffs in trade with China showed a different 
trend to other imports from these countries.23

was not systematically the case – at least not in US enterprises

18 Amiti et al. (2020) show that the quantitative reaction 
of imports to additional tariffs has increased over time.
19 Given a lack of “real” price data, unit values have been 
used instead. These are calculated as the ratio of trading 
values to the quantities (measured by item or weight) and 
can be used as a rough proxy for prices.
20 This finding is consistent with the results of other empir -
ical studies; see, for instance, Amiti et al. (2019); Cavallo et 
al. (2019); Fajgelbaum et al. (2020).
21 The CPI components taken into account are those for 
which consumer goods imports from China subject to add -
itional tariffs account for comparatively large proportions 
of the basket of goods in question. The specific items are: 
“misc. personal goods”, “floor coverings”, “living room, kit -
chen and dining room furniture”, “other furniture”, “other 
appliances”, “clocks, lamps and decorator items”, “dishes 
and flatware”, “nonelectric cookware & tableware” and 
“sports vehicles including bicycles”.
22 Together, the affected groups of goods have a weight 
of 1½% in the US consumer price index. In November 
2019, the annual growth rate of this sub- index was up 
5 percentage points on its long- term average. The direct 
impact of the tariffs on the headline CPI rate during this 
period was therefore probably roughly 0.1  percentage 
point.

tries which, together with China, account for the bulk of 
US imports.Deutsche Bundesbank

Domestic economic effects of import tariffs with regard 
to global value chains
The expansion of cross- border value chains 
has played a key role in the intensifi  cation 
of international trade over the past few 
decades.1 The fact that stages of produc-
tion are increasingly being distributed across 
a range of different countries has become 
apparent in the growing co- movement of 
imports and exports and in the declining 
share of domestic value added in exports, 
as well as in the rising percentage of goods 
that cross borders several times over.2
Given the existing tendencies towards a 
more restrictive trade policy, there arises the 
question of how the international interlink-
ing of production stages infl  uences the 
domestic  transmission of changes in trading 
costs. In addition to econometric approaches, 
macroeconomic structural models, such as 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) models, can be used as an analytical 
framework when studying this.3 For the 
sake of simplicity and easier handling, com-
monly used DSGE models dispense with 
value added chains.4 Various more recent 
papers show, however, that modelling cross- 
border production chains in DSGE models 
of open economies has major implications.5 
This is also true with regard to the effects of 
tariffs. The transmission channels through 
which tariffs infl  uence prices and demand 
differ markedly in the case of goods for pri-
vate consumption and intermediate goods.
This can be shown in a New Keynesian two- 
country DSGE model of open economies. In 
this model, cross- border production chains 
are modelled using trade in intermediate 
goods,6 which involves comparing two 
scenarios. In the fi  rst scenario, an increase 
in the tariff rate on imports of consumer 
goods by 10 percentage points is assumed, 
while, in the second scenario, a hike by the same amount in tariffs on the value of im-
ported intermediate goods is implied.
In the case of tariffs on consumer goods, 
the model shows the consumer price index 
initially increasing roughly in proportion 
with the share of imports in the underlying 
basket of goods. Owing to the relative in-
crease in cost of foreign goods, households 
shift their consumption to domestic prod-
ucts. Additional positive knock- on effects 
on domestic output are produced as a re-
sult of increased demand for intermediate 
1 According to Baldwin (2013), this development was 
originally due to the large wage differentials between 
industrial countries and emerging economies com-
bined with a decline in transport costs. Furthermore, 
technological advances in the information and com-
munications sector have opened up new possibilities 
of steering production over long distances and – in the 
case of services, too – making greater use of the ad-
vantages of the international division of labour.
2 See Johnson and Noguera (2017); European Central 
Bank (2019a); Ignatenko et al. (2019) and Georgiadis 
et al. (2020).
3 DSGE models are especially suitable for analysing the 
short and medium- term effects of exogenous non- 
anticipated disruptions. In the case of trade policy 
measures, long- term dislocations may also occur, how-
ever – owing to a permanent shortening of production 
chains, for example. These are not investigated here.
4 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2017); Barattieri et al. 
(2018) and Lindé and Pescatori (2019). One exception 
to be mentioned is the analysis by Imura (2019) which 
investigates the effects of import duties in a DSGE 
model with cross- border value chains and multi-
national enterprises.
5 See de Soyres and Gaillard (2019); Rodnyansky 
(2019); Gopinath et al. (2020) and Georgiadis et al. 
(2020).
6 This is an extension of the two- country model in 
Georgiadis et al. (2020). The extension comprises per-
sistent tariffs which are added directly to import prices, 
thus making the imported goods more expensive. The 
customs receipts are distributed to households. In the 
long term, the intensity of trade is determined by resi-
dents’ preference for domestic non- durable goods and 
intermediate goods. On a long- term average, imports 
as a percentage of total consumption correspond to 
15% in each category of goods. Exports are invoiced in 
the national currency of the buyer country. Nominal 
wages are adjusted on average once a year; producer 
prices are adjusted on average twice a year. In the case 
of consumer goods, a substitution elasticity of 1.5 is 
assumed between domestic and foreign products with 
a corresponding fi  gure of 0.8 for intermediate goods.Deutsche Bundesbank

goods. This is counteracted by reduced for-
eign demand resulting from the appreci-
ation of the domestic currency.7 The central 
bank of the country in question also tight-
ens its monetary policy, which dampens 
economic activity. Overall, the import tariff 
nevertheless stimulates domestic produc-
tion in the short term. In the medium term, 
however, there is a slight decline in gross 
domestic product. The initially marked rise 
in consumer prices eases over time. Besides 
tighter monetary policy, appreciation plays 
a major role, as intermediate goods imports 
become cheaper as a result and this, in 
turn, lowers producer prices.
If tariffs are raised on foreign intermediate 
goods instead, production costs rise at fi  rst 
in line with the share of imports used. This 
causes domestic producers to increase their 
prices. This direct effect becomes stronger 
in the domestic production network, as 
some of the goods are used as inputs in the 
country’s downstream stages of produc-
tion.8 An appreciation of the home currency 
also means that domestic products become 
more expensive for households and enter-
prises abroad. Domestic households shift a 
certain amount of their consumption to 
non- tariff imported goods, which become 
cheaper as a result of this appreciation. 
Overall, there is thus a decline in demand 
both at home and abroad for domestically 
produced goods. It is true that, owing to 
import tariffs, fewer intermediate goods are 
imported and domestic goods are used in-
stead. This does not offset the decline in 
demand, however.9 Domestic economic 
output thus shows a perceptible decline 
compared with the baseline without tariffs. 
Although slow price adjustments mean that 
consumer prices are not directly affected by 
import tariffs on intermediate goods, the 
increase in producer prices is also refl  ected 
over the medium term in a higher consumer 
price index.The restrictive trade policy measures 
adopted recently by the United States are 
directed in particular at intermediate goods. 
The presented simulation results suggest, 
however, that tariffs on such products pro-
7 Appreciation of the domestic currency due to import 
tariffs is a typical fi  nding in the literature; see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2017); Barattieri et al. (2018); Lindé and 
Pescatori (2019) and Furceri et al. (2019). Owing to 
higher infl  ation, there is a monetary policy tightening 
in the DSGE model and, as a result, a larger interest 
rate differential between home and abroad, which 
strengthens the domestic currency.
8 A rise in producer prices as a result of import tariffs 
may also be found in empirical analyses, say, in Amiti 
et al. (2019).
9 A similar outcome is documented by Barattieri and 
Cacciatore (2019) with regard to the US labour market. 
Accordingly, owing to a diversion to domestic produc-
tion in some sectors, temporary trade barriers may 
lead to a short- lived rise in employment, while down-
stream sectors, in particular, suffer marked employ-
ment losses. The timing of this decline in employment 
follows a rise in the prices of intermediate and fi  nished 
goods, suggesting a connection. In line with this, an-
other study provides some indications that there is a 
drop in downstream industrial output at the sectoral 
level following an increase in tariffs on imported inter-
mediate goods. See European Central Bank (2019b).Domestic economic effects of an increase

the period analysed here (up to May 2019).24 
Trade diversion effects were identified only for 
individual countries or product categories.25 
This suggests that US enterprises struggled to 
find alternative suppliers outside China at short 
notice.
Dwindling US imports from China do not ap -
pear to have been replaced by domestically 
produced goods, either. The production of 
goods in the United States that are subject to 
additional tariffs when imported from China 
did not develop differently from that of other 
products, at any rate.26 In both cases, the pre -
viously brisk upsurge tailed off at around the 
time at which the first restrictive measures to 
trade with China were applied. Although this 
may also be due to other reasons, it does not 
suggest that the additional tariffs have bol -
stered the US industrial sector.27 Instead, the 
tariffs have probably made the use of Chinese 
intermediate goods, and thus the production 
of final products, more expensive.28The evidence available therefore suggests that 
US consumers have been burdened by the add -
itional tariffs imposed by China and that US in -

tions …duce signifi  cantly less favourable real eco-
nomic effects than do tariffs on fi  nished 
goods.10 The likely intention behind intro-
ducing tariffs on intermediate goods is to 
repatriate the production of such goods. It 
is true that the model framework selected 
here does not allow any investigation of 
changes in international structures of pro-
duction. Studies suggest, however, that 
such adjustments are often diffi   cult to im-
plement and sometimes protracted because 
of the intricately interlinked way in which 
production networks are organised.11
10 Imura (2019) arrives at similar results in a two- 
country model; along with cross- border links in the 
production process, this also captures capital accumu-
lation and the endogenous entry and exit of enter-
prises.
11 See Bayoumi et al. (2019).
24 The additional tariffs have not resulted in any systematic 
diversion effects for China’s imports yet, either. Only for a 
few products, such as soybeans, did countries like Brazil 
step up their exports to China for a while. See European 
Central Bank (2019c).
25 Taiwan, for instance, seems to have been able to re -
place China in supplying certain electronic products. What 
also stands out is the very sharp rise in US imports of goods 
from Vietnam more recently. However, this also applies to 
products unaffected by additional tariffs when imported 
from China.
26 The analysis was carried out at the industrial sector level 
(4- digit NAICS codes). The sectors were defined according 
to whether or not the output of a given sector was below 
average in relation to imports from China subject to tariffs 
from the same sector in the period from July 2017 to June 
2018.
27 Flaaen and Pierce (2019) empirically analyse the impact 
of the additional tariffs imposed by the United States dur -
ing 2018 (not only on China) and the corresponding coun -
termeasures taken by its trading partners. The authors are 
unable to provide evidence of a statistically significant 
effect  on US industrial production (in either direction). They 
do, however, identify a negative impact on employment in 
the US industrial sector.

US manufacturing sector, accounting for 2½% of overall 
output.Deutsche Bundesbank

dustry has not benefited from them. To gain a 
rough estimate  of the macroeconomic effects 
of the trade disputes, we used the NiGEM 
global economic model.29 In keeping with the 
empirical findings, the simulations assumed 
that raising tariffs directly raises the domestic 
price of foreign products.30 It was also assumed 
that tariff revenue is transferred to house -
holds.31
According to the simulations, protectionist 
measures on both sides slowed economic 
growth in the United States and China slightly 
over the past two years. In the medium term, if 
the additional tariffs imposed to date were 
maintained, real GDP in the United States 
would be 0.5% lower than in an alternative 
scenario without additional tariffs. The losses 
for China are of a similar magnitude. The add -
itional tariffs drive up the inflation rate in the 
United States by as much as 0.3  percentage 
point, although in the model, the US Federal 
Reserve responds to rising cost pressures by 
tightening its monetary policy.
The simulations show mostly negative effects 
for third countries, too, although these are very 
minor. These effects stem from the fact that

29 NiGEM is the global economic model developed by the 
UK- based National Institute of Economic and Social Re -
search (NIESR). It models economic interconnectedness be -
tween over 60 economies and regions via foreign trade 
and the interest rate- exchange rate nexus. The model has 
New Keynesian features, especially forward- looking elem -
ents on the financial and labour markets. The expanded 
“US Tariff & BREXIT” version makes it possible to analyse 
trade policy measures. For further information, see https://
nimodel.niesr.ac.uk
30 For an in- depth description of the simulation approach, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018b). The scenario involving 
the trade dispute between the United States and China 
analysed there has been expanded here to include the tariff 
increases that have since been brought in.
31 On an annualised basis, in recent months (up to Novem-
ber 2019), the United States did actually record additional 
tariff revenue of around US$40 billion compared to 2017. 
Of this, US$16 billion alone was funnelled into an aid pack -
age for American farmers, who are bearing the brunt of 
China’s retaliatory measures.Deutsche Bundesbank

other countries.32 According to the simulation, 
Germany’s real GDP would lag behind by 0.1% 
in 2023 compared to the alternative scenario. 
In the same year, global GDP would be squeezed 
by roughly 0.3% and world trade by around 1%.
In fact, the aggregate losses for the United 
States and China, as well as third countries, 
could be even larger than those shown by the 
NiGEM model. Most notably, the simulations 
did not factor in uncertainty effects.33 How -
ever, there are indications that uncertainty sur -
rounding economic policy has risen worldwide 
in connection with the US- China trade dispute. 
Trade policy uncertainty and its repercussions 
are difficult to identify, though (see the box on 
pp. 57 ff.). Moreover, NiGEM does not model 
sectoral developments or interconnectedness 
via cross- border value chains. This means, in 
particular, that the aforementioned potential 
losses for US industry resulting from tariffs in 
downstream production stages cannot be re -
corded directly.
Measures against other 
trading  partners
Over the past two years, the United States has 
toughened its trade policy towards other coun -
tries, too. At the start of 2018, prompted by 
the country’s industrial sector, the US Adminis -
tration imposed safeguard tariffs on imported 
solar panels and washing machines.34 Accord -
ing to the Peterson Institute for International 
Economics, they cover a goods value totalling 
approximately US$10 billion per year. Besides 
this, starting in the second quarter of 2018, the 
United States imposed additional tariffs on im -
ports of steel and aluminium, justifying the 
measure on the grounds of national security.35 
This temporarily affected goods to the value of 
US$41 billion.36
As was the case with the measures imposed 
exclusively on China, these tariffs are unlikely to 
have yielded the macroeconomic benefits that 
the United States had hoped for. According to one case study, the tariffs on washing ma -
chines led to a small rise in employment with 
domestic producers. However, because con -
sumer prices for washing machines increased 
perceptibly at the same time, the cost- benefit 
ratio turned out to be rather unfavourable.37 
Other studies indicate that the US tariffs on 
steel also created a number of jobs in the US 
steel industry. Nonetheless, these additional 
jobs were apparently offset by far larger em -
ployment losses in the industries downstream, 
which were hit by competitive disadvantages 
from the higher price of steel products as a re -
sult of the tariffs.38
A number of trading partners, including the 
European Union, have fought back against the 
additional tariffs imposed by the United States 
on steel and aluminium. From the point of view 
of the European Union, these are safeguard 
tariffs which – at least in part – are not justifi -
able. The European Union therefore retaliated 
by imposing additional tariffs on a range of im -
ports from the United States in July 2018. These 
tariffs cover approximately US$3.5 billion worth 
of products, which is equivalent to around half 
the value of exports of steel and aluminium to 
the United States. Steel and aluminium also ac -Even greater

erable trade diversion effects in the short term, which more 
than offset the negative effects stemming from the decline 
in economic growth in the United States and China. See 
Bolt et al. (2019); International Monetary Fund (2018).
33 To factor in potential negative effects of greater uncer -
tainty, ad hoc assumptions are made in various simulation 
studies. See, inter alia, International Monetary Fund (2019).
34 The legal basis for these tariffs is Section 201 of the 
Trade Act of 1974. As safeguards, the tariffs are generally 
permitted under WTO rules. They are limited to four years 
for solar panels and three years for washing machines.
35 The legal basis for these tariffs is Section 232 of the 
Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Under WTO rules, Article XXI 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) per -
mits, in principle, interventions for the purpose of protect -
ing national security.
36 Mexico and Canada are now exempt from the tariffs 
after the United States negotiated a new free trade agree -
ment with both countries. This reduced the value of goods 
affected to US$26 billion.
37 The higher prices appear to have resulted in additional 
costs of US$1.5 billion for US consumers. This stood in con -
trast to the creation or retention of roughly just 1,800 jobs. 
In statistical terms, this equated to costs of just over 
US$800,000 per job. See Flaaen et al. (2019).

The impact of trade policy uncertainty
Against the backdrop of the current trade 
confl  icts, there arises the question of the 
economic implications of heightened trade 
policy uncertainty. In this respect, uncer-
tainty is cited as one factor behind the slug-
gish pace of global investment.1 Related 
analyses, however, are faced with the prob-
lem that there is no generally accepted 
measure of trade policy uncertainty. From a 
conceptual point of view, the few indicators 
differ considerably from one another in 
some cases.
A commonly used indicator of trade policy 
uncertainty uses text analyses to measure 
how often this topic is mentioned in na-
tional newspapers.2 Nevertheless, it is ques-
tionable how far this measure really refl  ects 
uncertainty, i.e. the limited predictability of 
future developments, and not simply the 
popularity of this topic.3 An alternative ap-
proach attempts to derive trade policy un-
certainty from the non- forecastable com-
ponent of effective import tariff rates.4 
However, this measure captures only uncer-tainty resulting from implemented policies. 
Announcements or threats of trade policy 
interventions are not taken into account.5 
For the United States, both the text- based 
and the tariff- based indicators of trade pol-
icy uncertainty show elevated levels at the 
current juncture that range from signifi  -
cantly above- average to very high.
The macroeconomic impact of an unex-
pected increase in uncertainty can be ana-
lysed using structural vector autoregressive 
models (SVARs). In an initial analysis, bivari-
ate models, each comprising one uncer-
tainty indicator and US capital goods pro-
1 Uncertainty is often said to have a dampening effect 
on investment. For potential transmission channels 
and effects of uncertainty, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2018c).
2 See Caldara et al. (2020). For a comparable measure-
ment approach, see Ahir et al. (2019).
3 Uncertainty is typically defi  ned as the conditional 
volatility of unpredictable disturbances; see Jurado et 
al. (2015). Thus, uncertainty differs from risk – in which 
case probabilities can be assigned to a set of potential 
outcomes (see Knight (1921)) – and surprises in the 
form of expectation errors (see Scotti (2016)).
4 To calculate this indicator, a stochastic volatility 
model of the effective US import tariff rate is estimated 
on a monthly basis by applying the particle fi  lter ap-
proach suggested by Born and Pfeifer (2014). The vola-
tility of the non- predictable components of the effect-
ive import tariff rate is then interpreted as a measure 
of trade policy uncertainty. See Caldara et al. (2020).
5 Furthermore, the underlying effective import tariff 
rate is calculated as the ratio of customs duties to im-
ports. This measure can therefore also be infl  uenced 
by changes in the composition of imports, which rep-
resents an additional drawback.Indicators of trade policy uncertainty in

duction, are estimated on a monthly basis.6 
The derived impulse responses, however, 
show no clear effect of trade policy uncer-
tainty on the real economy for either of the 
previously presented measures.7
What should be taken into account, how-
ever, is that the applied indicators might 
capture trade policy uncertainty less than 
adequately owing to the described concep-
tual shortcomings. For this reason, an indir-
ect approach is also considered here. A 
number of analyses show that trade con-
fl  icts can trigger noticeable responses on 
fi  nancial markets.8 Thus, it appears reason-
able that an indicator of fi  nancial uncer-
tainty which refl  ects the volatility of the 
non- predictable components of a large 
number of fi  nancial market variables,9 will 
also capture – besides other factors – trade 
policy uncertainty.6 The structural disturbances (shocks) are identifi  ed 
with a recursive identifi  cation scheme. The latter as-
sumes a direct impact of uncertainty shocks on capital 
goods production, while the respective measure of un-
certainty responds to investment- specifi  c shocks with 
the lag of one period. See Bachmann et al. (2013); 
Scotti (2016); and Meinen and Röhe (2017). The 
models are estimated on a monthly basis. While the 
assumption of a one- period lagged shock impact 
seems reasonable for monthly data, this would be 
more diffi   cult when using time series with a lower fre-
quency (such as quarterly data).
7 In the impulse- response analysis, the SVAR system is 
hit once by a structural shock of one standard devi-
ation. The impulse- response function shows the re-
sponse of the model variables to this unexpected im-
pulse over time. The analysis is based on models esti-
mated using Bayesian techniques. The maximum time 
lag with which the endogenous variables enter the 
SVAR model is 12 periods. The models additionally 
contain a constant and a linear trend.
8 See, for example, Baker et al. (2019a); and Baker et 
al. (2019b).
9 The indicator for the United States is provided by 
Ludvigson et al. (2020). For its calculation, a factor 
model is used in a fi  rst step to determine the predict-
able components of fi  nancial market series. On the 
basis of the resulting forecast errors, uncertainty is cal-
culated as the conditional volatility of the forecast 
errors using a stochastic volatility model.Financial uncertainty and trade policy measures in the United States

For the United States, such an indicator of 
fi  nancial uncertainty does indeed show a 
remarkable co- movement with various es-
calation steps in the current trade confl  icts. 
Recently, the indicator has displayed an 
above- average level. In particular, fi  nancial 
uncertainty increased noticeably earlier and 
more strongly compared with the tariff- 
based measure of uncertainty. This could 
have been the consequence of threats and 
announcements preceding the protectionist 
measures. If the measure of trade policy un-
certainty is replaced by the indicator of fi  -
nancial uncertainty in the bivariate SVAR 
model, the results now show a clearly sig-
nifi  cant, negative impact of an unexpected 
increase in uncertainty on US capital goods 
production.
A more careful assessment of the impact of 
fi  nancial uncertainty requires additional 
variables to be included in the model in 
order to control for other factors. More-
over, capital goods production approxi-
mates aggregate investment only to a 
limited extent. For this reason, a multivari-
ate SVAR model on the basis of monthly 
data is used in a fi  rst step to identify fi  nan-
cial uncertainty shocks.10 Subsequently, the 
quarterly growth rate of US gross fi  xed cap-
ital formation is regressed on the fi  nancial 
uncertainty shocks and their lags.11 The de-
rived impulse responses show a statistically 
signifi  cant negative impact of fi  nancial un-
certainty shocks on aggregate investment 
in the United States.12 It is nevertheless 
noteworthy that uncertainty on fi  nancial 
markets may be caused by multiple factors 
and that trade confl  icts are merely one pos-
sible trigger. If, however, trade tensions – as 
suggested by the evolution of the time 
series  – have recently caused increased un-
certainty on the fi  nancial markets, the esti-10 The bivariate model is extended by an indicator of 
macroeconomic uncertainty (see Jurado et al (2015)), 
the S&P 500 equity price index, a shadow short rate 
(see Krippner (2013)), the effective US import tariff rate 
and industrial production net of capital goods produc-
tion. The index of macroeconomic uncertainty is based 
on the volatility of forecast errors of a large number of 
relevant business cycle time series. The shadow inter-
est rate measures the degree of monetary policy ac-
commodation when the policy rate is at the zero lower 
bound and otherwise corresponds to the short- term 
interest rate. The estimation approach is equivalent to 
that of the bivariate model and assumes an immediate 
effect of fi  nancial uncertainty shocks on all other vari-
ables in the model.
11 In the second stage, the identifi  ed shocks are fi  rst 
converted into a quarterly frequency. The subsequent 
estimation assumes a maximum lag of eight periods. 
For a detailed description of the two- stage method-
ology, see, inter alia, Kilian (2009).
12 The effect is driven not only by the global fi  nancial 
crisis. Estimating the model for a restricted sample 
period from January 1982 to December 2008 confi  rms 
the signifi  cantly negative impact.Impact of an uncertainty shock

count for one- third of the imports affected by 
the retaliatory tariffs, with the rest divided fairly 
evenly between agricultural products and con -
sumer goods.39
Relative to total trade in goods between the 
United States and the European Union, which 
amounts to just over US$800 billion, the share 
of goods affected by additional tariffs remains 
very low to date.40 However, the United States 
has already repeatedly threatened to impose 
tariffs on a far greater scale. For instance, a 
study commissioned by the US Administration 
last February concluded that imports of motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle parts pose a threat 
to national security. This established a basis for 
safeguard tariffs, which, owing to exemptions 
for major trading partners, would primarily 
have burdened European manufacturers. The 
volume of goods potentially affected in the 
context of transatlantic trade amounts to 
roughly US$60 billion.Germany appears particularly vulnerable to 
protectionist measures of this kind because 
motor vehicles account for a significant part of 
its range of exports. However, simulations 
using NiGEM and the dynamic general equilib -
rium model EAGLE41 indicate that at least the 
direct macroeconomic impact of the intended Potential tariffs

13 Further likely factors behind the weak US invest-
ment growth were specifi  c problems in individual key 
industries (such as energy and aircraft construction), 
the phasing out of fi  scal stimuli, low profi  t margins 
as well as the general slowdown in global economic 
activity .Impact of a financial uncertainty shock

39 When selecting the groups of goods affected, the Euro -
pean Union probably also focused on minimising the po -
tential damage to its own economy. See Fetzer and 
Schwarz (2019).
40 This picture does not change even when factoring in 
the import tariffs imposed by the United States in the 
fourth quarter of 2019 on aircraft and certain consumer 
goods from the European Union totalling US$7.5 billion. 
This measure, approved by the WTO, is based on proceed -
ings that have been underway for some time now regard -
ing unauthorised subsidies for aircraft manufacturers. It is 
possible that the United States has not taken adequate 
measures to put an end to such subsidies, either. A WTO 
procedure concerning this matter is still ongoing.
41 The Euro Area and Global Economy (EAGLE) model is a 
calibrated dynamic general equilibrium model developed 
by Eurosystem experts to analyse the transmission of inter -
national shocks. It maps four regions of the world; in its 
present application, these are Germany, the euro area ex -
cluding Germany, the United States, and the rest of the 
world. For a detailed description of the model, see Gomes 
et al. (2012).Deutsche Bundesbank

tariff hike of 25 percentage points would be 
modest for Germany. In a corresponding scen -
ario, both models suggest medium- term GDP 
losses of less than 0.25% for Germany and the 
euro area as a whole.42 Losses in the United 
States itself could be of a similar size.43 If the 
magnifying effects of global value chains, the 
potential negative repercussions of heightened 
trade policy uncertainty and the countermeas -
ures threatened by the European Union, which 
are not included in the models, are additionally 
taken into account, the negative effects felt by 
all of the abovementioned economies could be 
far more pronounced.44
Against this backdrop, it is of little reassurance 
that the US Administration currently no longer 
appears to be pursuing its plan of imposing 
safeguard tariffs on motor vehicle imports for 
reasons of national security.45 Nevertheless, 
European trade surpluses and trade barriers 
continue to be subject to criticism from the 
United States. As a result, it seems that there is 
still the possibility that the United States could 
charge additional tariffs on a wide range of 
European products.46 This means that the dan -
ger of an all- out trade war between the United 
States and the European Union can probably 
not be entirely ruled out yet, either. However, 
such a conflict would cost both sides dearly. In 
a hypothetical scenario in which all tariffs in bi -
lateral goods trade are raised by 25 percentage 
points, the European Union’s GDP would, ac -
cording to NiGEM simulations, be reduced by 
1% over the medium term. The negative effects 
in the United States would be even more pro -
nounced. Partly due to its close trade links with 
the European Union, the adverse repercussions 
for the US economy would be significantly 
more severe than those arising from the cur -
rent conflict with China.
Summary
Overall, the findings indicate that the United 
States has so far been unable to benefit from 
its recent trade policy measures. Instead, it is likely that, as a result of the trade conflict with 
China, in particular, aggregate output in the 
United States has been somewhat dampened Danger of

42 Other studies arrive at similar conclusions using com -
putable general equilibrium models. See Felbermayr and 
Steininger (2019).
43 Both models agree that trade- restrictive measures 
therefore involve the risk of self- inflicted damage, even if 
no retaliatory measures are taken. In the simulations, this 
mainly stems from the fact that the inflationary effects of 
the higher tariffs, together with monetary policy tightening 
within the scope of the rules, places a strain on domestic 
demand in the United States. US export activity is also hit 
by the noticeable appreciation of the US dollar as well as 
the weaker economic activity experienced by the trading 
partners affected by the tariffs.
44 See European Central Bank (2019c); Dullien et al. 
(2019).
45 The US Administration initially offered its trading part -
ners the option of conducting negotiations to avoid safe -
guard tariffs. A decision by the US President on whether to 
implement these tariffs had been expected for mid-  
November 2019, following the submission of a progress 
report on the state of the negotiations. With the expiration 
of the deadline, it is likely that there is no longer a basis for 
imposing tariffs on motor vehicles for reasons of national 
security.
46 In particular, it is conceivable that the United States 
could – similar to the case of China – attempt to justify 
measures aimed at the European Union on the grounds of 
“unfair” trade practices in the future.Deutsche Bundesbank

and consumer price inflation has tended to 
rise. No notable positive effects on employ -
ment have been observed.
Furthermore, the findings presented in this art -
icle suggest that, so far, no “lucky bystanders” 
have benefited from the trade conflict between 
the United States and China. The trade diver -
sion effects seen thus far have been limited. 
Instead , the fact that economic growth has 
slowed in both the United States and China is 
likely to be of far greater significance. This is 
subduing their demand for imports from other 
countries and has presumably contributed to 
the current sluggishness in global trade. At the 
same time, the trade policy disputes are likely 
to have led to greater uncertainty worldwide, 
which is having an overall dampening effect on 
investment activity and the global economy.
In order to counter protectionist efforts, it 
would be necessary to strengthen the rules-  
based global trade system, with the WTO at its 
core. However, the WTO itself has come under 
fire as it will not be able to adequately meet 
the current challenges unless it adapts its rule -
book. This concerns, for example, provisions to 
protect intellectual property as well as the way 
in which it deals with state- owned enterprises. 
In addition, the United States has criticised cer -
tain aspects of the WTO’s dispute settlement 
system.47 For this reason, the United States has 
been blocking the nomination of new judges 
to the WTO Appellate Body for some time now, 
meaning that, since mid- December 2019, it has been unable to issue new rulings.48 If the dis -
pute settlement mechanism were to be per -
manently undermined, trade conflicts could 
play out in the open more frequently in future, 
potentially resulting in considerable damage to 
the global economy. To modernise the WTO, 
the European Union and other countries 
– jointly in some cases – have made proposals 
aimed at making processes more efficient, im -
proving adherence to rules, and reforming the 
dispute settlement system.49 However, the suc -
cess of such an ambitious push for reform de -
pends on the constructive participation of all 
WTO members.
In recent years, and in part due to the failure of 
the latest major round of WTO trade negoti -
ations (known as the Doha Round), many 
economies – including the European Union – 
have shifted the focus of their trade policy to -
wards bilateral and regional agreements. These 
often go far beyond the regulations agreed 
upon within the scope of general WTO agree -
ments. Under ideal circumstances, they would 
complement the WTO agreements. However, 
they are only an imperfect substitute for a 
functioning multilateral order.Third parties
