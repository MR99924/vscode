Commentaries
Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine 
probably had only a limited impact on Germa -
ny’s economy at first. This is indicated by the 
results of ifo Institute surveys on firms’ assess -
ment of the situation in March, which were 
down only slightly. The assessment of the situ -
ation remained stable, particularly among ser -
vice providers, although it improved signifi -
cantly in retail and even brightened substan -
tially in the hotel and restaurant services sector. 
This was probably connected to the easing of 
the measures to contain the coronavirus pan -
demic. This helped counter consumers’ ten -
dency to tighten their purse strings due to high 
inflation and increased uncertainty. By contrast, 
enterprises in the manufacturing industry and 
the main construction sector viewed their busi -
ness situation in a considerably gloomier light. 
This development is likely to have been driven, 
in particular, by a further significant worsening 
of bottlenecks in the supply of intermediate 
goods. This was particularly evident in the 
automotive sector, where production fell sub -
stantially in March according to data provided 
by the German Association of the Automotive 
Industry (VDA).
All things considered, economic activity in Ger -
many may have more or less stagnated in the 
first quarter of 2022. The supply bottlenecks in 
the industrial sector had probably eased slightly 
before the start of the war against Ukraine, 
with the construction sector also benefiting 
from the mild weather conditions. Both sectors 
saw significantly higher levels of output in 
January and February compared with the final 
quarter of 2021. Price- adjusted retail sales had 
edged up again slightly in February. In the hotel 
and restaurant services sector, price-adjusted 
sales had already recovered somewhat at the 
beginning of the year following their large de -cline in December. The economic impact of the 
Omicron wave caused by higher than average 
levels of sick leave has probably been smaller 
than feared.1
Nonetheless, the economic impact of the war 
is likely to significantly weaken the recovery, 
which had actually got off to a strong start. 
Disruptions to foreign trade and supply chains, 
soaring energy prices and heightened uncer -
tainty are weighing on enterprises and house -
holds. Firms’ business expectations deterior -
ated substantially across all sectors in March, 
according to ifo Institute surveys. The decline in 
industry was particularly pronounced, with pro -
duction plans and export expectations drop -
ping sharply, too. The magnitude of the macro -
economic repercussions of the war against 
Ukraine remains very uncertain, however, and 
is dependent on how the situation evolves (see 
the article on pp. 13 ff. for simulations based on 
a severe risk scenario).
Industry
After seasonal adjustment,2 German industrial 
output remained virtually unchanged in Febru -
ary 2022 compared with the previous month, 
which had undergone significant downward 
revision. On an average of January and Febru -
ary, however, it was considerably higher com -
pared with the fourth quarter of 2021 (+2%). 
The increase was fostered by continued brisk 
demand for industrial products and an easing 
of supply bottlenecks. According to ifo Institute 
surveys, on an average of January and Febru -
ary, the percentage of enterprises to see output Russia’s war of

hampered by shortages of materials was down 
distinctly compared with the fourth quarter. 
Broken down by main groupings, the manufac -
ture of consumer goods, in particular, increased 
steeply, with the production of pharmaceutical 
products up sharply, too. The manufacture of 
intermediate goods likewise rose significantly. 
Capital goods output was up markedly on the 
back, in part, of a clear rise in motor vehicle 
production. However, the impact of Russia’s 
war of aggression against Ukraine has placed a 
distinct strain on industry since March. Accord -
ing to the ifo Institute, supply bottlenecks have 
intensified again considerably. Moreover, ac -
cording to VDA data, the number of passenger 
cars manufactured fell strongly compared with 
February in seasonally adjusted terms. On an 
average of the first quarter, it was nonetheless 
slightly higher than in the previous quarter.
Industrial orders declined significantly in Febru -
ary from a high level, falling by 2¼% on the 
previous month in seasonally adjusted terms. 
On an average of January and February, how -
ever, they rose steeply compared with the pre -
vious quarter (+3¾%). If large orders, which 
tend to be volatile, are excluded, growth was 
markedly smaller (+1%). Broken down by sec -
tor, demand for capital goods was substantially 
higher, with orders up strongly, in particular, 
among producers of motor vehicles and motor 
vehicle parts and in other transport equipment. 
By contrast, manufacturers of machinery re -
ceived distinctly fewer orders. Demand for con -
sumer goods rose slightly, with manufacturers 
of pharmaceutical products posting a substan -
tial increase in orders. Orders of intermediate 
goods fell slightly. In regional terms, the im -
provement in new orders was due to strong 
growth in demand from non-  euro area coun -
tries. By contrast, orders from euro area coun -
tries and domestic orders dropped markedly. 
Industrial orders were still exceptionally high 
when compared with industrial output. While 
the latter was still down significantly on its level 
of the fourth quarter of 2019 – the quarter be -
fore the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis  – 
new orders were considerably higher.Industrial orders

Nominal industrial sales experienced a slight 
month- on- month decline in February 2022 
after seasonal adjustment (-¼%). On an aver -
age of January and February, however, they 
were up substantially on the previous quarter 
(+5%) in line with industrial output. Broken 
down by both region and main groupings, the 
increase was broadly based. After adjustment 
for seasonal variations, nominal exports of 
goods rose steeply in February (+6½%) on the 
month, more than offsetting the strong decline 
in January. On an average of January and Feb -
ruary, nominal exports of goods were markedly 
up on the quarter (+1½%), but they were down 
distinctly after price adjustment (-1½%). This is 
because real goods exports to the euro area 
countries were considerably lower. By contrast, 
real exports of goods to non- euro area coun -
tries were slightly higher. Nominal imports of 
goods also rose steeply in February on the 
month (+5%) following a sharp decline. On an 
average of January and February, they were up 
considerably on the quarter (+2%) due to large 
price increases, especially of energy imports. 
Meanwhile, real imports of goods fell steeply 
(-3¼%).
Construction
Construction output in February 2022 was 
slightly down on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms (-¾%). This is due to a significant 
decline in output in the finishing trades, where 
data are prone to revision, while output in the 
main construction sector was substantially 
higher. On an average of January and February, 
construction output rose steeply on the quarter 
(+4¼%), with output in the finishing trades, in 
particular, having undergone a strong upward 
revision in December 2021 before being revised 
down markedly in January 2022. Construction 
activity was bolstered in January and February 
by the mild weather for this time of year. In 
quarter- on- quarter terms, it rose substantially 
in both the finishing trades and in building con -
struction and civil engineering. Data for new 
orders in the main construction sector, which are only available up until January, declined 
sharply in comparison to the fourth quarter of 
2021. Nonetheless, the reach of the order 
books, as determined by the ifo Institute, indi -
cated that the orders situation remained fa -
vourable up until February. From March on -
wards, however, the construction sector, too, 
started to feel the fallout from the Russia-  
Ukraine war. The reach of the order books 
dropped slightly from its record level. Accord -
ing to ifo Institute surveys, equipment utilisa -
tion fell markedly from its peak in February. The 
impact is particularly apparent in a steep in -
crease in the materials shortages reported, 
after these had eased from the second half of 
2021.
Labour market
The labour market initially continued to chart a 
positive course in spite of the strains entailed 
by the Omicron wave and the outbreak of war 
in Ukraine. However, the previously high pace 
of employment growth slowed markedly in 
February. The number of employed persons 
rose by 34,000 on the previous month in sea -
sonally adjusted terms, an increase of just 
under half as many persons as in January. This 
almost put employment back at its level from 
the start of 2020. The increase in jobs subject 
to social security contributions was robust (ini -
tial estimates still as of January). Slightly less 
use was made of cyclical short- time working in 
January than in December. However, the De -
cember figure published by the Federal Employ -
ment Agency was revised up compared with 
the initial estimate. The loss of working hours 
per short- time worker rose again significantly. 
The number of new registrations for short- time 
work continued to drop distinctly in March, al -
though the Federal Employment Agency points 
out that some registrations may be recorded at 
a later stage and some at very short notice. 
This is because the decision to extend the regu -
lations to facilitate access to short- term work 
by a further three months was not made until 
late in the day. Other leading indicators for em -Nominal indus -

ployment suggest that employment will con -
tinue to grow. The ifo employment barometer 
fell significantly but still remained in expansion -
ary territory. Further indicators remained largely 
stable and optimistic. Nonetheless, the employ -
ment outlook is subject to heightened uncer -
tainty in the current environment.
Registered unemployment continued to decline 
in March but the positive development slowed 
here, too. After seasonal adjustment, there 
were 18,000 fewer persons registered with the 
Federal Employment Agency as unemployed 
than in February. Rounding meant that the un -
employment rate remained at its low level of 
5.0%, which also matches the pre-  crisis level. 
The IAB’s unemployment barometer even im -
proved once again in March, which is in line 
with a further decline in the number of un -
employed persons.
Prices
After shooting up at the start of the war, com -
modity prices for energy have declined mark -
edly over the past few weeks. This is mainly be -
cause energy supplies from Russia have, thus 
far, been disrupted less that initially feared. The 
price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has averaged 
US$106 in April thus far; this is around 8% less 
than in the previous month but still significantly 
more than prior to the outbreak of the war. 
The same is true of European natural gas, with 
prices standing at approximately €106 per 
megawatt hour in April thus far. The prices of 
crude oil futures also suggest a stabilisation of 
prices.3
The previously already strong upward pressure 
on import prices continued in February. The 
data do not yet include the effect of the Rus -
sian invasion on 24  February 2022. Import 
prices rose by around 26% compared with the 
previous year and thus almost as sharply as in 
January, with imports of energy continuing to 
be the main driver. Strong inflation also per -
sisted at the producer level. Data for March, which are likely to have been affected by the 
war in Ukraine, are already available here. The 
figures reveal that prices are up by 31% in com -
parison with the previous year, the strongest in -
crease since the time series began in 1949.4
Consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased 
in March by a seasonally adjusted 2.5% on the 
month. This was the strongest rise seen in Ger -
many since the introduction of the euro in 
1999. Year- on- year inflation also reached a 
new record high, of 7.6%. Inflation of this mag -
nitude was last seen during the First Gulf War, 
in 1981. The renewed surge in inflation dynam -
ics in March was attributable to energy, first 
and foremost. At the consumer level, the ex -
tremely high rise in prices in this sector even ex -
ceeds the degree that can be explained by sur -
ging prices in the international commodity 
markets. Furthermore, the underlying trend in -
crease in the prices of industrial goods, which 
was already considerable, picked up speed. 
This was attributable mainly to clothing and 
footwear, which were recently subject to extra -
ordinary price fluctuations. The same is true of 
food products, while momentum in the ser -
vices sector has stabilised at a high level. Price 
dynamics could remain similarly high over the 
next few months. However, this is dependent 
on further developments in the war in Ukraine, 
the associated supply bottlenecks and potential 
expansions of sanctions.
Public finances
Local government finances
Local government budgets (core budgets and 
off- budget entities) also ended the second 
coronavirus year with a surplus, up €2½ billion 
on the year to €4½ billion. Revenue rose by 
4½% (+€13 billion). Tax revenue alone was Slight fall in

15% higher (+€15 billion), exceeding both the 
pre- crisis level in 2019 and the anticipated rev -
enue level for 2021, last estimated before the 
outbreak of the crisis. Local business tax rev -
enue, in particular, saw a very sharp rise of 
35% on the year (after deducting shares accru -
ing to other government levels). Rhineland-  
Palatinate saw the highest increase in tax rev -
enue. This is likely to have been chiefly due to 
local business tax payments in connection with 
coronavirus vaccines by the biotechnology firm 
domiciled there. Local government receipts 
from fees recovered, increasing by 5%. By con -
trast, transfers from state government fell by 
4½% (-€5 billion). These had seen a significant 
temporary rise in 2020, as central and state 
governments compensated local government 
for anticipated crisis- induced shortfalls in local 
business tax revenue (€11 billion).
Local government expenditure increased by 
3½% (+€10 billion). Growth in other operating 
expenditure was particularly high (+6%, or +€4 
billion). Personnel costs rose significantly 
(+4½%), as did spending on social benefits 
(+4%), with accommodation costs for those re -
ceiving unemployment benefit II, included in 
the latter item, up by only 1%. Fixed asset for -
mation stagnated following its strong increase 
in 2020.
In spite of the fiscal surplus, local government 
debt increased by just under €1 billion last year. 
At end- 2021, it amounted to €137 billion (in -
cluding liabilities to the public sector). 
Investment- related credit market debt rose by 
€2½ billion to €104 billion, with Baden-  
Württemberg, Hesse and North Rhine-  
Westphalia in particular seeing growth. The 
volume of outstanding cash advances de -
creased by €2 billion to €31 billion, with local 
governments in North Rhine-  Westphalia, 
Rhineland- Palatinate and Saarland recording 
the sharpest declines. Nevertheless, volumes in 
these three federal states were very high at 
over €1,100 per capita each. The average vol -
ume of local government cash advances in the 
remaining ten non- city states was €140 per capita. Rhineland- Palatinate appears to be 
planning a one- time assumption of half of its 
local governments’ cash advances without hav -
ing it count towards its debt brake rules. The 
state intends to repay the assumed debts. The 
Rhineland-  Palatinate state parliament recently 
voted in favour of an appropriate amendment 
to the state constitution; it has, however, not 
yet passed the necessary implementing legisla -
tion. It is not yet clear whether central govern -
ment will take on part of local government leg -
acy debt, which was one of the goals listed in 
the coalition agreement. Debt relief pro -
grammes on the part of the federal states 
might be a sensible approach to handing finan -
cial flexibility back to local governments. Add -
itional rules should, however, then ensure that 
local government finances are sound going for -

Securities markets
Bond market
At €127.6 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2022 was down on 
the previous month’s figure (€143.3 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which were 
down on the previous month, and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds grew by €19.1 billion. Foreign 
debt securities worth €3.7 billion net were 
placed in the German market. The outstanding 
volume of debt securities in Germany therefore 
rose by €22.8 billion on balance.
In the month under review, the public sector 
increased its bond market liabilities by €10.7 
billion net, compared with €9.1 billion in Janu -
ary. Central government issued mainly two-  
year Federal treasury notes (Schätze, €6.4 bil -lion) and ten- year and 30- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds, €6.0 billion and €4.7 billion respect -
ively). This contrasted with net redemptions of 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills, €10.5 billion). 
State and local governments issued securities 
with a net value of €1.8 billion.
In February, credit institutions issued debt 
securities worth €10.6 billion net, compared 
with €10.5 billion one month earlier. On bal -
ance, these were mainly debt securities of spe -
cialised credit institutions (€7.4 billion). In add -
ition, the outstanding volume of mortgage 
Pfandbriefe rose by €2.9 billion.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €2.2 billion in February, following 
net issuance of €6.6 billion in the previous 
month. On balance, these redemptions were 
attributable entirely to other financial inter -
mediaries (-€2.9 billion), which redeemed struc -
tured products on a fairly large scale. Non-  
financial corporations issued debt securities 
with a net value of €0.7 billion.
In the context of the Eurosystem’s asset pur -
chase programmes, the Deutsche Bundesbank 
was the predominant buyer of debt securities 
in February, increasing its securities holdings by 
€14.8 billion. Domestic credit institutions and 
foreign investors acquired bonds worth €8.1 
billion net and €7.9 billion net respectively, 
whereas domestic non-  banks sold debt secur -
ities for €8.0 billion net.
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares worth 
€0.6 billion were issued in the German equity 
market. The outstanding volume of foreign 
shares in the German market fell by €6.1 bil -
lion. On the buyers’ side, all investor groups re -
duced their equity exposure in February. Do -
mestic non- banks in particular sold shares for 
€2.9 billion net. German credit institutions and 
foreign investors trimmed their share portfolios 
by €1.6 billion and €0.9 billion respectively.Net sales

Mutual funds
In February, domestic mutual funds recorded 
smaller inflows than in January (€12.2 billion 
compared with €17.0 billion). On balance, spe -
cialised funds reserved for institutional invest -
ors were the sole beneficiaries (€13.1 billion). 
Among the various asset classes, mixed 
securities- based funds attracted the most in -
flows (€6.2 billion), followed by bond funds 
(€2.6 billion) and open- end real estate funds 
(€1.3 billion). Foreign mutual funds active in 
the German market recorded outflows totalling 
€1.3 billion in February. German non- banks 
were almost the sole net buyers of mutual fund 
shares (€10.7 billion). In net terms, domestic 
credit institutions acquired shares for €0.5 bil -
lion, while foreign investors sold €0.3 billion 
worth of German mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €20.8 billion in February 2022, up €8.4 
billion on the previous month’s level. This was 
mainly attributable to an increase in the goods 
account surplus. Conversely, the surplus in in -
visible current transactions, which comprise 
services as well as primary and secondary in -
come, contracted slightly.
In February, the surplus in the goods account 
rose by €9.3 billion on the month to €15.1 bil -
lion because receipts expanded much more 
sharply than expenditure.
The surplus in invisible current transactions de -
clined marginally by €0.9 billion to €5.7 billion 
in February 2022. The slight deficit of €0.3 bil -
lion in the services account in January turned 
into a marginal surplus of €0.5 billion in the re -
porting month. Expenditure decreased some -
what more sharply than receipts, which was at -
tributable to small movements in several sub-  
items. Net receipts in primary income fell by 
€2.4 billion to €10.7 billion. While receipts con -

on portfolio investment rose in particular. By 
contrast, the deficit in the secondary income 
account narrowed from €6.1 billion to €5.4 bil -
lion in February.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 
triggered strong market reactions in the finan -
cial markets; these reactions were also partly 
reflected in the cross- border activities of market 
participants. Germany’s cross- border portfolio 
investment generated net capital imports of 
€10.3 billion (January: net capital exports of 
€29.9 billion). Foreign investors purchased Ger -
man securities to the tune of €6.7 billion net, 
with demand oriented primarily at bonds (€20.1 
billion). They chiefly sought paper issued by the 
Federal Government, which is regularly in de -
mand as a safe investment in periods of high 
uncertainty. Conversely, they parted with 
money market paper (€12.1 billion), shares 
(€0.9 billion) and mutual fund shares (€0.3 bil -
lion). Domestic investors disposed of foreign 
securities to the amount of €3.6 billion net. In 
light of the ongoing war, they sold a relatively 
large volume of shares (€6.0 billion). They also 
divested themselves of money market paper 
(€3.5 billion) and mutual fund shares (€1.3 bil -
lion), but added bonds –  primarily those de -
nominated in euro – to their portfolios (€7.2 
billion).
In February, the balance of financial derivatives 
recorded net outflows (€4.8 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €11.1 billion in the reporting month (Janu -ary: net capital imports of €6.0 billion). Domes -
tic enterprises increased their foreign direct in -
vestment (€10.3 billion), boosting their equity 
capital in non- resident enterprises by €10.8 bil -
lion, mainly through reinvested earnings. Ger -
man enterprises paid off their intra- group loans 
on balance (€0.6 billion). Conversely, non-  
resident enterprises withdrew direct investment 
funds from their affiliates in Germany to the 
tune of €0.8 billion net. Intra- group lending 
saw outflows of €2.7 billion. By contrast, non- 
resident enterprises increased their equity cap -
ital in German affiliates by €1.9 billion.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
outflows of capital amounting to €3.6 billion in 
February (following €18.8 billion in January). 
The Bundesbank’s net claims grew by €33.6 bil -
lion. While TARGET2 claims remained virtually 
unchanged, the Bundesbank’s liabilities arising 
from the deposits of non- euro area residents 
went down (€33.0 billion). By contrast, monet -
ary financial institutions (excluding the Bundes -
bank) recorded net capital imports (€26.3 bil -
lion). Transactions by general government re -
sulted in net inflows of funds from abroad (€7.1 
billion), whereas transactions by enterprises

Potential macroeconomic consequences 
of the war in Ukraine – simulations based 
on a severe risk scenario
Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine has worsened the economic outlook around the world, 
partly due to the direct effects of the hostilities and the uncertainty as to how the war will pro -
gress, and partly because the sanctions imposed against Russia by the European Union (EU) and 
its partners are likely to make themselves felt. These developments have sent prices for certain 
commodities, particularly fossil fuels, sharply higher, while foreign exchange and financial mar -
kets, too, have experienced major volatility.
As long as negotiations to end the war make no progress, there is a risk that hostilities will inten -
sify further. An escalation of this kind would probably prompt a further tightening of the sanctions 
against Russia and possibly spark retaliatory action. Given these circumstances, discussion is turn -
ing to the possibility of dramatically reducing the EU’s energy imports from Russia.
This article presents model calculations in an attempt to quantify the macroeconomic impact of 
such an escalation. Calculations are performed using the global macroeconomic model NiGEM, 
the Bundesbank’s macroeconometric model (BbkM- DE), a linear sectoral input- output model, and 
various satellite models. NiGEM is used to model international economic relationships, the BbkM- 
DE model reflects the idiosyncracies of the German economy, and the input- output model is 
intended to capture rationing effects in the use of energy.
The simulations for Germany show that, in the severe crisis scenario with particularly high ration -
ing effects, real gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to lag, in the short term, up to 5% behind 
the baseline scenario, as represented by the staff macroeconomic projections published by the 
European Central Bank (ECB) in March 2022. Since the ECB’s projections were finalised in early 
March, they entailed only an initial assessment of the impact of the war. In the severe crisis scen -
ario, real GDP would fall by just under 2% this year compared to 2021. Besides this, the inflation 
rate would be considerably higher for an extended period of time. The already very high rates of 
inflation projected in the baseline would be exceeded by around 1½ percentage points this year 
and by roughly 2 percentage points next year.
However, it should be noted that, even for a defined risk scenario, such calculations are subject 
to considerable uncertainty and may either overstate or understate future developments. One 
reason for this is that in some cases, the scale of the assumed shocks exceeds by far the magni -
tudes that prevailed when the model’s elasticities were determined. Another is that the input-  
output tables used for this purpose are only a rough yardstick for the complex production link -
ages.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine has 
dampened the economic outlook around the 
world. This is partly due to the direct effects of 
the hostilities and the uncertainty as to how 
the war will progress, and partly because the 
sanctions imposed against Russia and Belarus 
by the EU and its partners are likely to make 
themselves felt. Besides targeted measures 
against individuals and companies, these sanc -
tions include bans on financing, investment 
and exports in certain business areas, capital 
market sanctions, and the exclusion of a num -
ber of Russian and Belarusian banks from 
SWIFT.1 The EU Member States have also 
stepped up their efforts to reduce their de -
pendence on Russian oil and gas supplies. Rus -
sian coal imports will be banned altogether in a 
few months’ time.2 The United Kingdom has 
taken similar action and, in addition, will stop 
purchasing Russian crude oil by the end of the 
year. The United States has gone one step fur -
ther, banning imports of all energy sources ori -
ginating in Russia.
The direct consequences of these develop -
ments were especially visible in commodity 
markets. The price of natural gas shot up ini -
tially in Europe. Prices for crude oil, coal, key in -
dustrial metals and food products, particularly 
grain and vegetable oils, rose significantly in 
global markets. Foreign exchange and financial 
markets likewise saw major volatility, especially 
during the first few weeks of the war. The Rus -
sian rouble initially plummeted in value, and 
global equity markets recorded sharp losses.
The ECB responded as early as March 2022 to 
these developments, lowering its euro area 
growth projection for this year by 0.5 percent -
age point to 3.7%.3 Other institutions also re -
vised their forecasts downwards.4 Initial eco -
nomic data for the period after the outbreak of 
the war point in this direction, too. In March 
2022, energy prices rose sharply at the con -
sumer level as well. This was one of the reasons 
why annual inflation as measured by the Har -monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) 
climbed to 7.5% in the euro area and 7.6% in 
Germany. This backdrop and the prospect of 
continued price increases considerably eroded 
consumer confidence. On the business side, in -
dustrial enterprises, in particular, made down -
ward revisions to their production expectations. 
According to the Ifo business climate index, 
German enterprises’ business outlook even de -
teriorated more strongly than at the onset of 
the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.
Uncertainty about the further macroeconomic 
impact of the war in Ukraine remains extremely 
high. As long as negotiations to end the war 
make no progress, there is a risk that hostilities 
will intensify further. An escalation of this kind 
would probably prompt a further tightening of 
the sanctions against Russia and possibly spark 
retaliatory action. Given these circumstances, 
there is intense debate – especially in Europe – 
about the possibility of dramatically reducing 
all energy imports from Russia within a short 
space of time. This could be achieved by im -
posing tariffs on oil and gas imports, or through 
a complete embargo. One direct consequence 
of this would probably be a further significant 
rise in energy prices in Europe. Because it 
would be very difficult to completely replace 
Russian deliveries with higher imports from 
other commodity- producing countries in the Russia’s war of

2 The fifth sanctions package, adopted by the Council of 
the European Union on 8 April 2022, bans the import of 
coal and other solid fossil fuels with immediate effect. An 
exemption arrangement will apply until 10 August 2022 so 
that contractually agreed purchase obligations can be met.

short term, bottlenecks in the supply of gas, es -
pecially, are likely to occur in this scenario.5 The 
macroeconomic implications of such a scenario 
are currently the subject of lively debate 
amongst policymakers and academics.6
An adverse scenario from 
the perspective of macro­
economic models
Macroeconomic business cycle models provide 
one possible framework in which the macro -
economic implications of a further escalation 
of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions against 
Russia can be analysed. Besides various dy -
namic stochastic general equilibrium models, 
the Bundesbank’s analytical toolkit in this area 
contains semi- structural approaches, in particu -
lar.7 These include the Bundesbank’s macro-
econometric model, known as BbkM- DE, which 
is the key instrument the Bank uses to coordin -
ate its macroeconomic projections for the Ger -
man economy.8 The global macroeconometric 
model NiGEM has a similar basic structure.9 
However, it focuses less on capturing individual 
economies as accurately as possible. Instead, 
its strength lies in modelling the economic ties 
between countries, which are particularly im -
portant when it comes to analysing global 
events. Using simulation results for the inter -
national environment from NiGEM together 
with the macroeconometric model for the Ger -
man economy is intended to combine the ad -
vantages of both approaches.10
Assumptions for the scenario 
calculations
A hypothetical scenario in which the conflict 
escalates is analysed below.11 This could be 
triggered, for example, by Russia stepping up 
its combat operations – assuming that the mili -
tary conflict remains confined to Ukrainian soil. 
We assume that, in this case, the EU supports 
an embargo on Russian products, including 
fossil fuels. Through rising commodity prices, dwindling trade links and a prolonged period 
of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, 
Germany and the other euro area countries 
would face greater economic strains than those 
outlined in the ECB’s March projections.

markets for crude oil, natural gas and coal.

lands, see Berben et al. (2022).
11 The scenario was developed and calculated in mid-  
March 2022. The assumptions are therefore based on this 
data vintage. In the simulation calculations, the assumed 
intensification of the conflict thus already impacts in part 
on economic activity in the first quarter of 2022.Deutsche Bundesbank

to a number of industrial metals and agricul -
tural products. Owing to its geographical prox -
imity and well- developed transport infrastruc -
ture, Europe is often the main buyer of these 
products (see the box on pp. 18 f.). If key buyer 
countries impose an embargo on Russian en -
ergy exports, it therefore stands to reason that 
commodity prices will rise well above their re -
cent all- time highs. However, it is difficult to 
gauge exactly how prices will respond. Because 
the focus here is on a relatively adverse scen -
ario, it is assumed that the price of a barrel of 
Brent crude oil rises to over US$170.12 Coal 
prices could then climb sharply, too. Natural 
gas prices in Europe are expected to see the 
strongest rises since Russian deliveries will be 
very difficult to replace in the short term.13 For 
non- energy commodities, the expected price 
mark- ups would be more moderate overall.14 In 
all these cases, it is assumed that prices will 
peak in spring 2022 before declining slowly 
(sometimes with seasonal fluctuations). While 
it is assumed that the import bans on Russian 
products will remain in force over the entire 
simulation period, we also take into account 
the fact that supply and demand responses in 
all parts of the world increase over time.
The war and the sanctions imposed are already 
having a considerable negative impact on Euro -
pean companies’ foreign business. Many firms have withdrawn voluntarily from the Russian 
market. These tendencies would probably be 
reinforced in the assumed scenario of an escal -
ation of the conflict. The model calculations as -
sume that there are no new exports at all from 
the euro area and the other G7 countries to 
Russia and Ukraine. In Germany, this would af -
fect just over 2¼% of total goods exports (or 
less than 1% of GDP). The shares for the euro 
area as a whole are somewhat higher because 
Finland, Slovenia, Slovakia and the Baltic coun -
tries maintain close trade links with the con -
flicting parties. Russia and Ukraine even ac -
count for almost 15% of Lithuania’s total goods 
exports, which means that the export value 
there comes to over 9% of GDP .
Uncertainty in the euro area has increased sig -
nificantly since the start of the military conflict 
in Ukraine.15 An indicator of economic policy 
uncertainty based on a study of newspaper art -
icles rose sharply in March 2022,16 as did the 
distribution of future expectations in the sur -
veys conducted by the European Commission 
among euro area businesses.17 The first few 
weeks of the war even saw the implied volatil -
ity of the European stock index Euro STOXX 50 
rise roughly as steeply as it had during the 
European sovereign debt crisis of 2012. Macro -
economic uncertainty has probably increased,

12 Analysts from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies 
believe that the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil could 
rise to more than US$160 in the event of an embargo, for 
example. See Fattouh and Economou (2022).
13 Specifically, a peak price of around €300 per megawatt 
hour (MWh) would have to be paid for natural gas at the 
TTF trading hub in the Netherlands in the scenario in ques -
tion. That equates to around three times the current price. 
However, compared to the highest price recorded to date, 
at the beginning of March 2022, the difference only comes 
to just over €50 per MWh.
14 The model calculations make a distinction here be -
tween prices for metals, agricultural commodities, and 
food products.

flict.18 The scenario calculations assume that 
uncertainty will remain elevated for one quar -
ter. The macroeconomic implications of this as -
sumption are derived from a structural vector 
autoregression model (SVAR model) using a re -
cursive identification scheme.19 According to 
this approach, an uncertainty shock has a 
negative, statistically significant effect on pri -
vate consumption, investment and real GDP , 
which gradually tails off over a period of around 
three years. An unexpected increase in uncer -
tainty also tends to dampen inflationary pres -
sure. In the macroeconometric models, the un -
certainty effects are therefore implemented as 
demand shocks.
Fiscal policy priorities have recently shifted in 
the light of the violent conflict in Ukraine. The 
Federal Government paved the way for a sig -
nificant rise in military spending. Other meas -
ures are aimed at easing the burden of the 
growing energy costs on households and en -
terprises. The simulation calculations take ap -
proximate account of these government meas -
ures to the extent foreseeable up to mid- March 
2022.20 For the rest of the world, meanwhile, 
no changes to the fiscal policy stance are as -
sumed relative to the existing assumption made 
in March.21 Monetary policy does not respond 
to the various shocks in the model calculations, 
meaning that the simulation results may also 
provide an indication of the need for monetary 
policy action. The implications described below 
should be interpreted as a deviation from the Additional pub -

18 The preferred measure of uncertainty for the euro area 
in this case is derived from the volatility of forecast errors 
resulting from the forecasting of a broad selection of busi -
ness cycle- relevant time series and financial market data. 
The fluctuation intensity of forecast errors determines the 
degree of uncertainty here. For a detailed explanation of 
the methodology, see Jurado et al. (2015) and Meinen and 
Röhe (2017).
19 In addition to a measure for macroeconomic uncer -
tainty, inputs to the estimated Bayesian SVAR model in -
clude a stock market index, a shadow short rate as a meas -
ure of the monetary policy stance, the HICP , the unemploy -
ment rate, and real GDP on a quarterly basis.
20 Because this analysis was finalised early on, further re -
lief measures agreed upon by the coalition committee at 
the end of March have not been included in the simula -
tions. Nor do the calculations contain any additional spend -
ing for Ukrainian refugees.
21 The automatic stabilisers work freely, however. None -
theless, the supporting effects of international fiscal policy 
are likely to be underestimated, if anything, since steps to 
cushion the impact of the surge in energy prices have also 
recently been taken in countries including France, Italy and 
Spain. The spillover effects of these measures on the Ger -
man economy will probably be limited, however.Deutsche Bundesbank

Russia’s importance as a commodities exporter
Russia is one of the world’s most important 
commodities producers. For each of the 
energy  commodities – crude oil (and petrol-
eum products), natural gas, and coal – Rus-
sia is among the three most important ex-
porters.1 It also holds a central position in 
the global markets for numerous industrial 
metals and minerals.2 The country is, in 
fact, the global market leader for palladium, 
nickel and aluminium.3 Russia is also, like 
Ukraine, an important exporter of agricul-
tural products. Both countries hold a large 
share of the global market for wheat, in 
particular.4
European countries, including Germany and 
some eastern European nations, source a 
signifi  cant proportion of their raw materials 
from Russia. This is particularly true of en-
ergy imports.5 More than one- fi  fth of Euro-
pean imports of crude oil and petroleum 
products originated in Russia in 2020.6 
Meanwhile, some 40% of natural gas im-
ports to the European Union (EU) came 
from Russia.7 Germany even sourced more 
than half of its gas imports from Russia.8 
Given these high import shares, it is diffi   cult 
to imagine that they could be completely 
replaced at short notice. Russian natural gas 
imports, especially, could probably be sub-
stituted only partially in the short term, as 
other exporters do not have suffi   cient add-
itional production capacity. In addition, 
there are capacity bottlenecks in Europe’s 
gas infrastructure, especially in terms of 
liquefi  ed natural gas terminals, regasifi  ca-
tion plants and natural gas pipelines.9 More-
over, the fact that liquefi  ed natural gas sup-
pliers have long- term contracts with other 
customer countries limits their ability to 
supply Europe, at least in the short run.Against this backdrop, the economic sanc-
tions taken against Russia and those being 
mooted since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
sparked concern that the commodities mar-
kets would experience a considerable short-
fall in supply. In addition, the war caused 
disruptions to transportation, and the risk 
1 See bp (2021). Russian exports of crude oil repre-
sented just under one- eighth of global crude oil trade 
in 2020. The country’s market share of petroleum 
products such as petrol, diesel or heating oil was 
somewhat lower, at just under 10%. In terms of nat-
ural gas, Russia even accounted for around one- fi  fth of 
the global market in 2020.
2 According to data provided by Trade Data Monitor 
(TDM), Russian exports of industrial metals and min-
erals represented around 5% of global exports of these 
commodities in 2020. This makes Russia the third most 
important exporter of this category of commodities 
worldwide.
3 TDM data show Russia to be the world’s largest ex-
porter of each of these three commodities, with the 
following shares in global exports: palladium (30%), 
nickel (13%) and aluminium (9%). Russia is also one of 
the world’s most important producers of numerous 
other raw materials, some of them critical, including 
arsenic, cobalt, industrial diamonds, iron, gallium, ger-
manium, lead, lime, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphate, 
platinum, silicon, silver, steel, sulphur, titanium, tung-
sten and vanadium, according to the U.S. Geological 
Service.
4 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations, Russia is the world’s largest ex-
porter of wheat, accounting for around 19% of global 
exports in 2020. Ukraine, in turn, was the world’s fi  fth- 
largest exporter with a share of just over 9% of global 
trade.
5 However, even looking at industrial metals and min-
erals, the EU Member States as a whole source a par-
ticularly high percentage of their imports (around 12%) 
from Russia, according to TDM data.
6 Just under half of hard coal imports were supplied by 
Russia.
7 At the current end, the percentage of EU gas imports 
sourced from Russia lies at around 23% according to 
McWilliams et al. (2021).
8 In terms of crude oil and petroleum products, Ger-
many acquired just under 30% of its imports from Rus-
sia in 2020.
9 McWilliams et al. (2022) suggest that gas consump-
tion in Europe would have to be curbed signifi  cantly if 
Russian gas supplies were to be halted altogether, as 
other exporters would probably not be able to fully re-
place the deliveries in the short term. Gas consump-
tion, particularly for power production, could be re-
duced both by converting existing gas- fi  red power 
plants to oil burning and by making greater use of coal 
and nuclear power plants.Deutsche Bundesbank

of potential retaliatory action as well as 
additional sanctions was seen. As a conse-
quence, the prices of many commodities 
rose dramatically at the start of the war. 
Within a few days, the price of Brent crude 
oil, for instance, climbed by more than one- 
third to just under US$134 per barrel, its 
highest level in 14 years. European natural 
gas prices, which had already risen strongly 
in the preceding months, mainly as a result 
of a reduced supply from Russia, even 
doubled, at times. However, once it be-
came clear that energy commodities would 
initially be largely exempt from western 
sanctions and with Russia’s commodity ex-
ports falling only moderately to date, most 
prices came back down again signifi  cantly. 
This was also true of the prices of numerous 
industrial commodities and food products, 
whose prices had previously risen equally 
sharply. At the current end, prices of crude 
oil and European natural gas still exceeded 
pre- war levels by around 9% and 12% re-
spectively. Prices for non- energy commod-
ities were also above their pre- war levels, by 
around 4%, according to the Hamburg In-
stitute of International Economics (HWWI).
Russia’s large importance for numerous 
commodity markets and the fact that the 
supply situation in these markets was 
strained, in some cases, even before the 
war started means that commodity prices 
are subject to considerable upside risks. 
Prices could, in fact, exceed their recent 
highs in the event of greater restrictions of 
Russian commodities exports, for instance 
as a result of new sanctions or a suspension 
of Russian deliveries.AM J J A S OND J FMA

baseline, which reflects the ECB’s March staff 
projections.22
Implications for the 
international  environment
The simulations carried out using the global 
macroeconomic model NiGEM suggest that a 
further escalation of the war in Ukraine would 
substantially darken the economic outlook. 
They indicate that aggregate euro area GDP 
would be 1¾% lower this year than anticipated 
in the ECB’s March projections. The level of 
economic activity would experience similar dips 
in 2023. The burdens would then probably 
ease slightly in 2024.23
This timescale is largely attributable to the re -
ceding uncertainty shock. The adverse effects 
caused by persistently higher commodity prices 
increase successively, on the other hand. This is 
primarily due to significantly reduced private 
consumption stemming from losses in purchas -
ing power. Private investment is another ex -
penditure component that is likely to drop 
sharply compared to the baseline. The consid -
erably gloomier export outlook in the model, 
meanwhile, reinforces the downward move -
ment because the increase in commodity prices 
produces similarly adverse effects for many trading partners.24 This is compounded by the 
fact that the loss of access to the Russian and 
Ukrainian sales markets directly limits European 
enterprises’ export opportunities. Within the 
euro area, this has a particularly adverse effect 
on those economies with close trade links to 
both countries.
For Germany, the NiGEM simulations show a 
considerable reduction in foreign demand. Ger -
man products do, however, become somewhat 
more competitive on balance in the global mar -
kets because the higher commodity prices 
make price pressures somewhat stronger still in 
the rest of the world and major exchange rate 
movements remain absent owing to the global 
nature of the shock and the assumed passivity 
of monetary policy.
Consequences for the German 
economy
The potential macroeconomic consequences 
for Germany were estimated based on simula -
tions with the Bundesbank’s macroeconometric 
model (BbkM- DE). The model allows for a de -
tailed analysis of the impact of the individual 
shocks, above all how they affect consumer 
prices. Government measures can also be in -
corporated relatively precisely. Similarly to the 
regularly published Eurosystem staff macro-
economic projections, the implications of the 
escalation scenario for the international envir -
onment described in the previous section are Considerable

22 These projections, which were finalised at the beginning 
of March 2022, only incorporate the initial assessment of the 
repercussions of the war for the euro area economy but not 
an escalation of the crisis as assumed in the scenario.
23 These figures are based on simulations in which Ger -
many and the rest of the euro area were exposed to the 
same uncertainty shock. The results that were reused as 
input variables for the estimation of the effects on Ger -
many in the macroeconometric model exclude this channel 
for Germany so as to avoid double- counting.
24 Over a longer period, the price increases simulated in 
the model also reduce the energy intensity of the economy. 
Via this channel, potential output also decreases with the 
lower factor input. Overall, the still relatively moderate in -
crease in the price of crude oil has the greatest impact in 
NiGEM because it accounts for a large share of the energy 
mix.Deutsche Bundesbank

fed into the simulations as exogenous develop -
ments.
Alongside the information on the movements 
in commodity prices, foreign demand, foreign 
competitors’ prices and exchange rates from 
NiGEM, the simulations also take into account 
the effects of heightened uncertainty on do -
mestic demand in Germany. The latter effects 
were derived from satellite calculations using a 
SVAR model for Germany and implemented via 
shocks to private consumption and business in -
vestment.25 In order to present a differentiated 
picture of the impact of higher energy and 
food commodity price quotes on consumer 
prices, disaggregated inflation forecasting 
models are used to gauge the effects on the 
energy and food components of the HICP . 
These are then integrated into the analysis with 
the BbkM- DE model. The government meas -
ures taken into account correspond to the rele -
vant estimates made in mid- March 2022.26
The simulations indicate that the assumed 
steep rise in commodity prices exerts a strong 
immediate effect on economic activity. This ef -
fect is mainly transmitted via two channels. 
First, the aggregate production function in 
BbkM-  DE takes energy into account as a third 
production factor alongside labour and capital. 
The increase in energy prices raises the cost of 
energy usage, which depresses factor demand 
and therefore also energy imports. Second, 
consumer prices rise as a knock- on effect of 
the HICP energy component. This dampens real 
income, thereby inducing households to re -
duce their consumer spending.
German exports fall significantly below their 
baseline level. This is due to the major import -
ance of the losses in foreign sales markets for 
German exports. This is not offset by the op -
posing effect of the German economy’s in -
creasing price competitiveness at the inter -
national level.
The negative implications of increased uncer -
tainty for business investment and household spending amplify the decline in aggregate de -
mand and therefore the contractionary effect 
of the other transmission channels.
Overall, real GDP in the current year decreases 
by just under 2% relative to the baseline. In 
subsequent years, the simulation results 
– driven by the impact of commodity prices27 – 
indicate that this decline will be stronger still. 
The positive fiscal stimulus is already included 
here, although this only absorbs a relatively 
small share. However, it can be assumed that in 
such a scenario, further fiscal support measures 
would probably be taken beyond the govern -
ment measures that are already incorporated 
into these simulations and those which are 
now also in planning, as a way to further ab -
sorb the negative impact on GDP .28
In terms of prices, higher commodity prices for 
energy and food have a substantial impact on 
the HICP rate in Germany, putting it at around 
1½  percentage points above the baseline in 
2022. This effect is set to be even greater the 
year after. Even in 2024, the inflation rate is still 
elevated, albeit no longer as strongly. These dy -… taking into

25 In the SVAR model used to estimate the effects for Ger -
many, GDP was replaced by private consumption or busi -
ness investment, respectively.
26 Higher government consumption and investment ex -
penditure was assumed over the entire simulation period in 
order to capture the impact of increased military spending. 
In addition, it was assumed that higher monetary transfers 
and subsidies are granted in the second quarter of 2022 to 
provide households and enterprises with a degree of relief 
from the increased energy costs.
27 Note here that a significant share of this reflects indirect 
effects which are transmitted through subdued foreign de -
mand and which, under a different definition, would be as -
signed to the sales market channel.
28 Comparing the results for the euro area (from NiGEM) 
with those for Germany (BbkM- DE), the GDP effects in the 
current year are of a similar magnitude. In the two years 
thereafter, however, real GDP in Germany (according to the 
BbkM- DE model) are significantly more subdued than the 
NiGEM results for the euro area would suggest. Two main 
factors can explain this: first, the income elasticity of im -
ports is substantially higher in NiGEM, meaning that im -
ports respond fairly strongly to changes in aggregate de -
mand. This mitigates the negative GDP effects significantly. 
Second, the gas price shock cannot be implemented in a 
country- specific way in NiGEM. A greatly delayed but grad -
ually increasing effect, such as would be expected for con -
sumer prices in Germany (and is also specified thus in 
BbkM- DE) cannot be captured in NiGEM. Instead, the im -
pact of the gas price shock there is immediate and is less 
persistent, similar to that of an oil price shock.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2022  
21

namics reflect the lagged effects of gas price 
shocks, first and foremost. This is a particularity 
of the adjustment of German consumer gas 
prices to commodity price developments.
When interpreting the simulation results, it 
should be noted that specific developments re -
sulting from distortions in financial markets 
have not explicitly been taken into account. 
They can be relevant in particular in an adverse 
scenario like the one assumed here. Generally 
speaking, the effects of this type of financial 
market shock are limited in macroeconometric 
models of this kind. However, here they are 
likely to be partly covered by the uncertainty 
shocks.
The macroeconometric model framework used 
here is able to capture dynamic interactions re -
sulting from the distinct shocks. At the same 
time, it is limited in that GDP is calculated using 
the expenditure- side approach, while the im -
pact of the war also causes disruptions on the production side. This would be the case in the 
event of an energy embargo in particular, be -
cause production shortfalls could already 
materialise  now in the short term as a result of 
rationing. Such rationing effects cannot be 
readily expressed in a model based on the 
expenditure-  side approach, and can therefore 
only be captured indirectly through price ef -
fects. However, as the resulting quantitative 
adjustment in energy imports itself then only 
occurs gradually, this is unlikely to fully capture 
the effects of such an embargo.29 In addition, 
the macroeconometric models used here disre -
gard sectoral differences in production func -
tions and linkages via value chains. For these 
reasons, it is worth observing the direct effects 
of a sudden energy embargo from another per -
spective.
Additional disruptions to the 
German economy in the 
event of an energy embargo
A complete stoppage of Russian energy sup -
plies would probably not only produce effects 
that are confined to prices and the quantitative 
adjustments these trigger, but also lead to a ra -
tioning of energy use in the German business 
sector. The fact that Germany sources a large 
portion of its gas from Russia plays a particu -
larly critical role here. Coal imports, meanwhile, 
are of lesser significance.30 The resultant de -
clines in enterprises’ production are quantified 
using a linear sectoral input- output model.31 Financial market

29 In addition, the estimated price elasticity of energy im -
ports is relatively low.
30 In the case of coal, the availability of short- term substi -
tutes for Russian imports is likely to be significantly greater 
than for natural gas. Russian coal could be fairly quickly 
substituted with bituminous coal imports from other coal- 
producing countries. See Federal Ministry for Economic Af -
fairs and Climate Action (2022).
31 For similar analyses based on input- output tables, see 
also European Central Bank (2022b) and OECD (2022). 
Bachmann et al. (2022) uses a non- linear static inter -
national trade model based on input- output tables, as well 
as the partial model of the constant elasticity of substitu -
tion (CES) production function. What these approaches 
have in common is their focus on volume effects resulting 
from energy shortages, whilst other transmission channels 
(e.g. uncertainty effects) are not considered in either case.Deutsche Bundesbank

The advantage of such a model is that inter -
mediate inputs between economic sectors can 
be examined as well as associated amplification 
effects. One disadvantage, however, is this 
model’s static and partial perspective.
The supplementary simulation calculations are 
based on the assumption that the sudden stop -
page of Russian energy supplies would reduce 
the use of natural gas, bituminous coal and re -
fined petroleum in the sectors that rely on 
these sources of energy by 40% this year, as 
from the second quarter.32 The assumed scale 
of the shock is based on the share of Germa -
ny’s primary energy consumption made up by 
Russian supplies of these three energy sources 
in 2019.33 It is assumed here that no possible 
substitutes are available in the short term.34 In 
the linear input- output system of equations, 
shortfalls of energy intermediates reduce the 
output values of directly affected sectors by the 
same percentage, in arithmetical terms.
A certain degree of discretionary scope is inher -
ent in the modelling with regard to the extent 
to which economic sectors are directly exposed 
to shocks and those which are only indirectly 
affected via input- output relationships. For this 
reason, two model versions are calculated. In 
the first version, only the energy production 
and supply sectors are cut off directly from sup -
plies of Russian energy.35 In the model, the 
shocks directly impact downstream sectors in 
line with the degree to which they depend on 
the energy sectors to provide their intermediate 
inputs. The second version of the calculation 
assumes that in addition to energy suppliers, 
energy- intensive sectors are also directly af -Scenario in

32 This procedure is based on the hypothetical extractions 
method. See Miller and Blair (2012), pp.  563 ff., and 
Dietzen bacher and Lahr (2013). The calculations are based 
on the German input- output table for 72 categories of 
goods as per the Federal Statistical Office for the year 
2018. The shock duration of three quarters is based on a 
starting date in mid- March 2022, which is when the scen -
arios were determined. One assumption is that natural gas 
could also be rationed outside of the heating season this 
year if the topping- off of barely- filled gas storage tanks 
takes priority during this time. See also Holz et al. (2022).
33 According to AG Energiebilanzen (2020), bp (2020) and 
comments made by the German National Academy of Sci -
ences Leopoldina (2022), Germany sourced just over 50% 
of its natural gas imports, 45% of its bituminous coal im -
ports and over 30% of its crude oil imports from Russia in 
2019. Germany’s dependence on imports was very high for 
each of these energy sources. Its total primary consump -
tion of energy from natural gas, refined petroleum and bi -
tuminous coal came to more than 8,800 petajoules (PJ) in 
that year, according to AG Energiebilanzen (2020). Were 
Russian energy imports to cease, then, this would reduce 
primary energy consumption by approximately 3,500 PJ, or 
around 40%.
34 Microeconomic studies on production stoppages result -
ing from supply chain disruptions (in the aftermath of nat -
ural disasters, for example) indicate that intermediate in -
puts cannot be easily substituted on account of search fric -
tions and relationship- specific investments, at least not in 
the short term (see Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016), Boehm et 
al. (2019) and Carvalho et al. (2021)). Energy is, in principle, 
a fairly homogeneous product that is generally relatively 
easy to substitute. However, natural gas and refined petrol -
eum products are primarily supplied by Russia to Germany 
via pipelines, which makes it difficult to substitute them in 
the short term. That being said, certain saving and substi -
tution possibilities would exist in the current year, even for 
natural gas (see German Council of Economic Experts 
(2022a)).
35 These include the manufacture of coke and refined pet -
roleum products as well as energy supply sectors (gas, 
steam and air conditioning and electricity). In 2018, these 
two sectors respectively accounted for a 0.1% and 1.5% 
share of the value added in all sectors, according to the 
input- output table.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

fected by the energy supply shortages.36 These 
are primarily sectors which use fossil energy 
sources to power their production plants or 
which process fuels as raw materials. This re -
flects the expectation that the energy supply of  
some energy- intensive sectors would also be 
restricted in the event of an energy embargo – 
an assumption consistent with a scenario 
where supplying households and basic social 
services with energy would take priority in the 
event of rationing.37
For the current year, the supplementary model 
calculations produce GDP losses of 1% in the 
first version of the calculation and 3¼% in the 
second version in the event of a stoppage of 
energy supplies.38 Substantial amplification ef -
fects resulting from input- output linkages are 
evident in both versions. The aggregate impact 
of the shock is more than twice as large in each 
case when intermediate inputs are also taken 
into account. This is due to the fact that above 
all the sectors closer to the start of the value chain, such as producers of basic materials in 
the manufacturing sector, would be hit hard by 
the shock.
The scenario calculations are subject to a great 
deal of uncertainty for two reasons. First, the 
effects of an energy embargo strongly depend 
on the availability of substitutes in the short 
and medium term. The assumption that no 
substitution is possible could overstate the eco -
nomic losses. Global shortages of the embar -
goed energy sources and the limited transport 
options – neither of which are captured by the 
model – also have a bearing on the availability 
of possible substitutes. The complex technical 
challenges of replacing pipeline- bound gas and 
oil supplies cannot be sufficiently captured by 
the model, either.39 Furthermore, it is uncertain 
which sectors would be particularly hard- hit by 
rationing, as this would also be at the discre -
tion of state authorities, at least in the case of 
natural gas supply. Second, the diversity and 
complexity of value chains as well as potential 
regional differences in terms of impacts within 
Germany cannot be fully captured in the eco -

and air transport (0.2%).

38 The assumed duration of the shock (three quarters) is 
captured in the statistical model framework by reducing 
the GDP losses calculated on an annual basis by one-  
quarter. Owing to the type of modelling used in the calcu -
lations and the natural gas- intense nature of the majority 
of the directly affected sectors in the two versions of the 
calculations, the rationing effects of natural gas account 
for the lion’s share of the calculated GDP effects. Excluding 
shortages of bituminous coal and oil products, the ration -
ing effects for the current year would be around one- third 
smaller in the second version of the calculation.
39 In the short term, the shortfall caused by the stoppage 
of Russian crude oil supplies could, in principle, be covered 
by additional imports from other countries and by Germa -
ny’s existing oil reserves. Even so, replacing the supplies to 
refineries in eastern Germany might present logistical chal -

nomic model. This would tend to result in an 
underestimation of amplification effects.40
Interpreting the results
Viewed overall, the severe crisis scenario would 
produce considerable negative GDP effects for 
Germany. However, the actual size of these ef -
fects is hard to quantify, even for a defined 
scenario. If the losses quantified in the macro-
econometric model and the input- output 
framework are taken together, the GDP loss in 
Germany for the current year could total up to 
5%, according to the calculations presented 
here.41 The following years would see the 
losses decline again somewhat, particularly if 
the Russian energy supplies can gradually be 
replaced in part and the associated rationing 
effects ease off. But even in 2024, economic 
activity would still be significantly below the 
baseline.42 Another aspect fraught with great 
uncertainty is the impact on the inflation rate. 
According to the simulations, the inflation rate 
would be 1½  percentage points above the 
baseline on average this year and would reach 
a considerably higher level in the subsequent 
period on account of the delayed pass- through 
to final consumer gas prices.
The analysis assumes that the GDP losses com -
puted with the macroeconometric model and 
the input- output analysis can, for the most 
part, be added up in the short term. However, 
it is possible that they could overlap, at least to 
some extent. This is due in part to the differing 
perspectives of the two model approaches. The 
macroeconometric model framework can only 
capture supply- side effects indirectly, as the ef -
fects on GDP unfold via the expenditure com -
ponents and their response to energy price 
hikes. However, the model- endogenous re -
sponse of aggregate energy consumption does 
give some clues. In the short term, its price 
elasticity is relatively low in the model estima -
tions, meaning that the calculated volume ef -
fects of supply stoppages are only covered by 
the direct responses to the energy price hikes to a minor extent.43 This speaks in favour of 
adding up the contributions from model simu -
lations and input-  output analysis. However, 
such an approach could lead to a certain over -Energy embargo

40 In the model framework, shocks are passed through to 
downstream production sectors in proportion to the share 
of the sectors’ production value accounted for by inter -
mediate inputs such as energy. This share is generally mod -
est, dampening amplification effects. In fact, though, even 
the failure of components with little economic value can 
create significant production shortfalls. For example, the 
war in Ukraine has led to supply bottlenecks in cable har -
nesses, resulting in production stoppages in the automo -
tive industry. Furthermore, the analysis is based on the Ger -
man input- output table. Additional negative spillover ef -
fects resulting from production stoppages at trading part -
ners as a consequence of an international energy embargo 
are not considered here.
41 The calculations depart from a baseline established at 
the beginning of March 2022, which – on the basis of a 
continuing recovery from the impact of the pandemic – 
had already assumed GDP shortfalls and increased inflation 
for the current year due to the outbreak of the war.
42 This is likely to be due to the delayed pass- through of 
gas price hikes to the consumer, with an accordingly damp -
ening effect on household consumption. Furthermore, the 
sales prospects of German exporters would still be below 
their baseline level.

statement of the overall impact. This is particu -
larly relevant beyond the short term, as substi -
tution effects are then likely to come more into 
play. At a fundamental level, the time profile of 
the rationing effects is subject to uncertainties. 
If these effects materialise primarily during the 
winter months, the GDP losses are likely to roll 
over to the coming year to a greater extent.
Estimations of GDP losses are subject to both 
high upside and downside risks owing to the 
variety of relevant transmission channels whose 
complexity means that they can only be cap -
tured partially in the models, if at all. It should 
be noted that the scale of the assumed shocks 
in some cases far exceeds the magnitude that 
applied during the estimation period used to 
calculate the model elasticities.
However, short-  term substitution possibilities 
for fossil energy sources could, in fact, be 
greater than assumed, as substitution possibil -
ities are unobservable, and, therefore, reliable 
estimates are not available. Additionally, the 
substitution elasticity in the current situation 
could be increased by means of prudent crisis 
management, for example. Furthermore, it can 
be assumed that the fiscal policy response con -
sidered in the simulations would be signifi -
cantly stronger in the event that the crisis were 
to escalate. This would partially offset the de -cline in GDP . All things considered, the war in 
Ukraine is, in any case, intensifying adjustment 
pressure from pivoting away from fossil fuels – 
an issue that the German economy was already 
facing prior to the outbreak of the war.
With regard to the impact on inflation, the up -
side risks are likely to predominate. Potential 
price increases resulting from energy rationing 
at downstream production stages have been 
disregarded, as have wage increases in an en -
vironment of massively increased energy costs 
(which have not been observed on this scale in 
recent decades), which may be stronger than 
assumed in the model. Equally, enterprises may 
demand higher mark- ups than usual on ac -
count of the supply bottlenecks that originated 
during the coronavirus pandemic in some 
cases.
All of this demonstrates the high uncertainty 
underlying these and similar model calculations 
and the difficulties involved in capturing the 
complex technical conditions for supplying en -
ergy, as well as their significance for supply 
chains, in macroeconomic models. Neverthe -
less, they do suggest that a supply stoppage 
could lead to considerable GDP losses and a 
further, more protracted rise in the inflation 
rate in Germany and in the wider euro area.Estimation of

Development of the debt situation in the 
euro area private non- financial sector since 
the outbreak of the COVID-  19 pandemic
Despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, households and non-financial corporations in 
the euro area have not seen their debt situation deteriorate significantly overall. Patterns observed 
in the euro area as a whole have largely been matched by developments in the bloc’s four largest  
Member States, though heterogeneity is evident. Across all the countries under review, debt levels 
in the household and non- financial corporations sectors rose substantially. At the same time, 
however, both sectors significantly expanded their stocks of liquid assets, and their assets grew to 
a noticeable degree. This mostly led to improvements in asset- based debt indicators such as 
leverage and the debt coverage ratio. Income levels, by contrast, declined considerably in some 
cases, worsening most of the income- based metrics such as the debt ratio and debt service ratio. 
Government assistance payments buoyed the income of households and non- financial corpor -
ations distinctly. The Eurosystem’s non- standard monetary policy measures, too, stabilised sec -
toral income and the interest rate level, thus preventing the debt ratio and debt service ratio from 
climbing more significantly still.
The expected normalisation of monetary policy will probably not unduly exacerbate the debt situ -
ation of households and non- financial corporations. This conclusion is supported by simulations 
of the debt service ratio, which is particularly sensitive to interest rates. A simulation at the euro 
area level up to the end of 2024 indicates that the debt service ratio will increase only for house -
holds and noticeably so only under adverse conditions. The adverse scenario assumes that inter -
est rates at the short and long ends of the yield curve increase by 100 basis points more than 
expected in the staff macroeconomic projections of the European Central Bank (ECB) from March 
2022. The repercussions of the war in Ukraine are only incorporated into the projections to a cer -
tain degree. Scenario calculations indicate, however, that the additional price pressures might be 
greater than the losses sustained by the real economy. This would generally push up nominal 
income flows somewhat and mitigate developments in the debt service ratio.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In the euro area, private non- financial sector 
debt as a proportion of nominal gross domes -
tic product (GDP) rose rapidly at the onset of 
the coronavirus pandemic (see the chart 
below).1 Non-  financial corporations in particu -
lar increased their borrowing significantly in an 
effort to offset lost sales and build up liquidity 
buffers. At the same time, the pandemic-  
related restrictions and changes in behaviour 
sharply diminished national income. As the 
economy recovered in the second half of 2020, 
debt in the euro area and its four largest Mem -
ber States – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – 
started to recede again relative to GDP , but was 
still above pre- pandemic levels as late as the 
autumn of 2021.
An increase in debt of this magnitude is of rele -
vance for economic policy as it can have a var -
iety of possible knock- on effects. For instance, 
in the past, multiple debt metrics proved to be 
effective early warning indicators of banking 
and financial crises.2 In addition, periods of 
sharply rising debt are usually followed by 
phases of deleveraging, which are often associ -
ated with weak economic growth.3 Further -
more, according to recent research findings, 
monetary policy might have a greater impact as a result of the financial restrictions imposed by 
high levels of debt.4
This article offers a detailed analysis of how the 
debt situation in the private non- financial sec -
tor in the euro area has evolved since the out -
break of the coronavirus pandemic. By drawing 
on a range of indicators, it is possible to per -
form a broad and nuanced assessment of the 
debt situation. The article furthermore exam -
ines how the debt service ratio – an indicator 
that is particularly sensitive to interest rates – 
might respond over the course of the expected 
normalisation of monetary policy. Finally, some 
conclusions for economic policy are drawn 
from these developments. There are three key 
findings:
– despite the impact of the coronavirus pan -
demic, the debt situation of households and 
non- financial corporations in the euro area 
has not deteriorated significantly;
– the forthcoming normalisation of interest 
rates should not unduly increase the debt 
service ratios of households and non-  
financial corporations;
– it is unlikely that the private non- financial 
sector will significantly cut back its spending 
on account of the current debt situation in 
response to a normalisation of monetary 
policy.Private non-

How the debt situation has 
evolved since the outbreak 
of the COVID-  19 pandemic
A range of variables can be used to assess the 
debt situation of the private non- financial sec -
tor. These include income- based measures, 
such as the ratio of debt to GDP , on the one 
hand, and indicators based on balance sheet 
metrics, on the other. To obtain as robust an 
assessment of the debt situation as possible, 
the present article analyses a range of indica -
tors, examining households and non- financial 
corporations not just in the euro area as a 
whole, but also in its four largest Member 
States (Germany, France, Italy and Spain).
Non- financial corporate debt is the sum of con -
solidated loans, debt securities, pension provi -
sions and trade credit.5 For households, debt is 
comprised only of loans. The following metrics 
are based on data from the financial accounts 
and the national accounts.6 They thus repre -
sent macroeconomic aggregates for the two 
separately analysed sectors of households and 
non- financial corporations. Specifically, the fol -
lowing indicators are analysed:
– Debt ratio: The debt ratio expresses debt in 
relation to sectoral disposable income. Using 
disposable income rather than GDP provides 
a more precise estimate of the sectoral in -
come flows available to service the debt. A 
higher debt ratio means that debt has in -
creased relative to current income, reducing 
the sustainability of the debt over the me -
dium term.
– Leverage: This measures debt capital as a 
proportion of total assets.7 Higher leverage 
means that the debt is covered to a lesser 
extent by assets. This increases the risk that 
the proceeds raised by liquidating the assets 
might not suffice to amortise the debt, redu -
cing the sustainability of the debt over the 
long term.– Debt service ratio: The debt service ratio rep -
resents the share of disposable income used 
for interest payments and amortisations.8 A 
higher debt service ratio indicates a lesser 
ability to settle due payment obligations out 
of current income. This increases the risk of 
short- term payment defaults.
– Debt coverage ratio: This measures debt in 
proportion to liquid assets in the form of 
currency and deposits. A higher debt cover -
age ratio indicates a lesser ability to settle 
due payment obligations by reducing liquid -
ity reserves. Here too, there is a greater risk 
of short- term payment defaults.
The chart on p. 34 shows the development of 
these indicators between end- 2019 and the 
close of the third quarter of 2021 for non-  
financial corporations as well as the contribu -
tions made by each determinant. The period 
thus covers the last pre- pandemic data vintage 
all the way up to the current figures. The lower 
part of the chart plots the evolution of the debt 
indicators over time. For all the metrics, a 
higher level is indicative of a worse debt situ -
ation.… using a range

5 Consolidated loans are total loans adjusted for intra -
sectoral lending. The bulk of the latter is probably attribut -
able to intragroup transactions. As a result, using uncon -
solidated data would overstate the debt level.
6 The statistical basis for these sets of accounts is the Euro -
pean System of Accounts (ESA) 2010.
7 Debt capital corresponds to total non- equity liabilities for 
non- financial corporations and total liabilities for house -
holds, meaning that it is defined more broadly than debt. 
For non- financial corporations, total assets are approxi -
mated by total liabilities. For households, ECB estimations 
are used for total household assets. The ECB calculates 
quarterly data based on annual national data. Values for 
2021 have been extrapolated. See European Central Bank 
(2022) for details on the interpolation and extrapolation of 
quarterly data.
8 The debt service ratios presented in this article were cal -
culated independently using the methodology of the Bank 
for International Settlements (BIS). According to this ap -
proach, debt consists solely of loans and debt securities. 
Furthermore, non- financial corporations’ disposable in -
come according to the national accounts is augmented by 
the dividends paid. The economic logic behind this is that 
shareholders have no firm entitlement to dividends, so en -
terprises are able to reduce dividend payments and use the 
funds thus released to service debt. See Bank for Inter -
national Settlements (2017).Deutsche Bundesbank

Non- financial corporations significantly in -
creased their borrowing at the onset of the 
COVID-  19 pandemic in particular, not only to 
offset a distinct drop in sales, but also to build 
up buffers for potential liquidity bottlenecks. 
Despite this build- up of debt, it was only in 
Spain that the debt ratio rose noticeably over 
the entire period, though this was driven mainly 
by the sharp decline in income. Furthermore, 
this increase began from a low level by histor -
ical standards following a lengthy period of de -
leveraging in the wake of the European debt 
crisis.9 In the euro area as a whole as well as in 
Germany and Italy, the debt ratio actually de -
creased thanks to the comparatively positive growth in income. The debt service ratio, by 
contrast, rose in each of the four largest coun -
tries and in the euro area as a whole.10 Devel -
opments in Spain were especially pronounced 
in this case, too. Here again, though, the in -
crease started from a comparatively low level.

10 Income made smaller contributions to changes in the 
debt service ratio because of the significant reduction in 
dividend distributions. The income used to calculate the 
debt ratio was stabilised as a result. Since dividend distribu -
tions are added when calculating income used to deter -
mine the debt service ratio according to the BIS method -
ology (see footnote 8 on p. 33), this was not a source of 
relief.Deutsche Bundesbank

sponse to the coronavirus pandemic contrib -
uted to a further decline in the interest rate 
level, which reduced debt service ratios in all 
countries.
Non- financial corporations considerably ex -
panded their stocks of liquid assets at the onset 
of the coronavirus pandemic in particular, 
which pushed down the debt coverage ratio 
across all countries. This effect was most pro -
nounced in France and Italy. Leverage, by con -
trast, moved in different directions in different 
countries. It rose slightly in Italy and climbed 
significantly in Spain. The developments in both 
countries resulted above all from the build- up of debt capital. An additional factor in Spain 
was that the losses in the market value of 
equity sustained at the onset of the coronavirus 
pandemic were not fully recouped. Germany, 
France and the euro area as a whole, by con -
trast, saw declines in leverage, with the issu -
ance of equity and growth in the market value 
of equity more than making up for the increase 
in debt capital.

financial corporations sector as a whole may 
mask possible heterogeneity across individual 
firms. A more nuanced assessment, however, is

The development of the debt situation since the outbreak 
of the coronavirus pandemic: a sectoral perspective based 
on the AnaCredit dataset for the euro area
The economic repercussions of the corona-
virus pandemic differ greatly across various 
categories of enterprise. Consequently, for 
a differentiated assessment of the debt situ-
ation, granular data are required. The ana-
lytical credit datasets for the euro area 
(AnaCredit ) provide data on debt in the 
form of bank loans at the individual bor-
rower level.1 In addition, information on 
sectoral affi   liation is available for each bor-
rower. This enables an analysis of the debt 
situation broken down by sectors which are 
particularly affected by the coronavirus pan-
demic or not.2
To calculate debt indicators, bank loan li-
abilities have to be expressed as a ratio. The 
AnaCredit dataset, expanded to include 
enterprise- specifi  c information, provides 
two balance sheet metrics in this regard. If 
an enterprise’s outstanding bank loans are 
expressed relative to its total assets, this re-
sults in enterprise- specifi  c bank loan- based 
leverage (for the sake of simplicity, herein-
after referred to as leverage). Annual turn-
over is an income fl  ow which, when ex-
pressed in relation to bank loans, results in 
an enterprise- specifi  c bank loan- based debt 
ratio (for the sake of simplicity, hereinafter 
referred to as the debt ratio).
The analysis below subdivides the entire 
sector of non- fi  nancial corporations in the 
euro area into two groups. The fi  rst group 
comprises non- fi  nancial corporations from 
sectors that were hit particularly hard by the 
coronavirus pandemic. These include enter-
prises whose business activity was substan-
tially hampered by government restrictions 
and changes in consumer behaviour, in par-
ticular services with direct customer con-tact, such as hospitality or travel.3 The 
second group comprises the other enter-
prises.
Both debt indicators are initially calculated 
at the individual enterprise level, based on 
which an adjusted mean value is com-
puted.4 The balance sheet metrics are either 
fl  ows over a calendar year (annual turnover) 
or values as at the end of the year (total 
assets). Correspondingly, the debt indica-
tors are each observed at year- end. The 
value as at the end of 2019 thus shows 
the situation prior to the outbreak of the 
coronavirus pandemic. The change be-
tween the end of 2019 and 2020 provides 
information about the impact of the fi  rst 
phase of the coronavirus pandemic. The 
change between 2020 and 2021 indicates 
1 For a detailed classifi  cation of the German AnaCredit  
dataset, see Kolb et al. (2021).
2 The analysis is subject to certain constraints. One is 
that the AnaCredit dataset, containing loans granted 
by banks from the euro area, covers only part of 
 aggregate debt. This means that changes in the debt 
situation caused by shifts within the debt instruments 
cannot be identifi  ed. Nor does the AnaCredit dataset 
record enterprises whose total loans, as reported by 
the lender, come to less than €25,000. Another con-
straint is that enterprises which do not maintain credit 
relationships with banks within the euro area are dis-
regarded in the dataset. Moreover, discernible statis-
tical challenges still exist in terms of the balance sheet 
metrics available for calculating debt indicators.
3 Specifi  cally, this group is made up of the following 
sectors according to NACE Rev. 2 codes: 47: “retail 
trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles”, 51: 
“air transport”, 55: “accommodation”, 56: “food and 
beverage service activities”, 79: “travel agency, tour 
operator reservation service and related activities”, 90: 
“creative, arts and entertainment activities”, 93: 
“sports activities and amusement and recreation activ-
ities”, 96: “other personal service activities”.
4 Owing to fl  awed balance sheet data, this results in 
economically implausible values for both indicators in 
some cases. To adjust for these outliers, the analysis is 
limited to values between 1% and 100%. This roughly 
corresponds to one- tenth or ten times the value for 
the aggregate corporate sector.Deutsche Bundesbank

whether the trends from the previous year 
intensifi  ed once again or whether the situ-
ation was already able to ease somewhat. 
The adjacent chart shows the results of the 
evaluation.
Both debt indicators rose over the entire 
period at a discernibly steeper pace in the 
particularly affected sectors.5 The difference 
between these sectors and the other enter-
prises is more noticeable in terms of the 
debt ratio, with, above all, the turnover of 
particularly affected enterprises falling rela-
tively sharply on account of the pandemic- 
related restrictions and changes in behav-
iour. Across all enterprises, both debt indi-
cators increased especially in the fi  rst year 
of the pandemic. In 2021, leverage among 
the particularly affected enterprises de-
creased perceptibly once more. Within the 
group of particularly affected sectors, hos-
pitality and travel saw the most signifi  cant 
deterioration in their debt situation.Change in debt indicators of non-

5 By contrast, leverage declined among non- fi  nancial 
corporations on aggregate. One notable reason for 
this is probably that the equity capital used in the 
aggregate  fi  gures is based on market values while the 
AnaCredit data are based on (lower) carrying amounts.Deutsche Bundesbank

such as the analytical credit datasets for the 
euro area (AnaCredit), which are a source of 
timely information on firm- level bank loans to 
the corporate sector. An analysis of AnaCredit 
data shows that both the debt ratio and lever -
age increased primarily in sectors that were hit 
particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic 
(see the box on pp. 40 f. for further details).
Households saw their debt ratios and debt ser -
vice ratios increase across all countries (see the 
chart on p. 35). In Germany, France and the 
euro area as a whole, this was attributable 
solely to the increase in debt, with households 
borrowing to purchase residential real estate in particular. Higher income levels, however, re -
duced these two debt indicators when viewed 
in isolation. By contrast, it was the decline in in -
come that explained almost all of this rise in 
Spain, and just over one- third of it in Italy. With 
the exception of Spain, the further decline in 
interest rates during the period under review 
noticeably eased the debt service burden.
In the household sector, too, the strong build- 
up of liquid assets lowered the debt coverage 
ratios in all the countries under review. This 
was notably because the coronavirus pandemic 
reduced the opportunities for consumption. In -
come trends were relatively robust, which 
meant that households built up excess savings, 
primarily in the form of deposits.11 Leverage 
declined as well across all the countries ob -
served here, partly as a result of the acquisition 
of financial and non- financial assets and partly 
due to valuation gains on assets. Residential 
real estate markets in particular were robust, 
with prices continuing to rise.12 Households in 
Spain registered the steepest decline in the 
debt coverage ratio and leverage. Their liquid 
assets and assets grew substantially, while their 
borrowing and debt capital actually declined 
slightly at the same time.
Government assistance payments distinctly 
buoyed the disposable income of households 
and non- financial corporations (see the adja -
cent chart), thus preventing the private non-  
financial sector’s debt and debt service ratios 
from climbing more significantly still. Con -
versely, this government assistance drove up 
public debt as well, however.13 In Germany and 
France in particular, mounting government 
subsidies stabilised non- financial corporations’ 
sales, which were experiencing a downturn. In Microdata

Italy and Spain, these direct assistance pay -
ments were much smaller in size, and non-  
financial corporations in these two countries 
shored up their income instead by reducing 
spending on employee compensation in par -
ticular. In all the countries with the exception 
of France, non- financial corporations further -
more increased their disposable income by cut -
ting back on their dividend payouts.
In turn, these lower dividend payouts trans -
lated into lower investment income for house -
holds. In Italy and Spain, furthermore, reduc -
tions in wage expenditure among non- financial 
corporations spilled over to households in the 
form of declining labour income. Government 
transfer payments to households, meanwhile, 
increased significantly in all the countries under 
review, making large positive contributions to 
income growth. In the euro area as a whole 
and particularly in France, these transfer pay -
ments were so extensive that disposable in -
come even rose substantially as a result. In Ger -
many, they stabilised disposable income, if 
nothing else, while in Italy and Spain, they at 
least prevented an even greater slump in dis -
posable income.
Given the sometimes contradictory signals sent 
out by the individual indicators, there is the 
question of how developments in the debt situ -
ation should be assessed as a whole. To allow 
for a comparison of the information provided 
by each metric, they must first be standardised 
by transforming them into what are known as 
z- scores.14 The information is condensed by 
computing the unweighted means of the four 
individual indicators for both sectors. As above, 
a higher value indicates a worse debt situation. 
The chart above illustrates how this composite 
indicator has evolved.
This composite indicator revealed that, since 
the outbreak of the COVID-  19 pandemic, only 
non- financial corporations in Spain saw their 
debt situation worsen noticeably, though this 
deterioration did admittedly begin from a fa -
vourable level by historical standards. In France and Italy, the composite indicator registered a 
minimal increase over the entire period. Non-  
financial corporations in Germany and the euro 
area as a whole even saw their debt situation 
ease somewhat over the entire period, after 
having tightened briefly. Households likewise 
found that their debt situation generally im -
proved irrespective of the coronavirus pan -
demic, though there was one exception – only 
in Germany did the composite indicator rise 
slightly. Viewed on aggregate, the debt situ -
ation of the private non- financial sector deteri -
orated by significantly less than suggested by 
the debt- to- GDP ratio, which is often the only 
measure used to assess the debt situation. In 
addition, the increase in debt relative to GDP is, 
for the most part, not unusually strong by his -
torical standards (see the box on pp. 40 f.).… and of

The development of debt since the outbreak of the 
coronavirus  pandemic in historical perspective
How should the rise in debt ratios since the 
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic be 
viewed in historical perspective? To answer 
this question, stylised facts on previous debt 
phases are fi  rst derived using long time ser-
ies.1 The evaluation is based on debt data 
from the Bank for International Settlements 
(BIS).2 To ensure as long- term a perspective 
as possible, the analysis makes use of data 
for the private non- fi  nancial sector as a 
whole. For reasons of data availability, debt 
in this context corresponds to the sum of 
households’ loans and non- fi  nancial cor-
porations’ loans and debt securities. Nom-
inal gross domestic product (GDP) is used as 
the income fl  ow for calculating the debt 
ratio. The analysis focuses on industrial 
countries as, fi  rst, longer time series are 
available for these countries and, second, 
this produces a more homogeneous sample 
from which more representative conclu-
sions for the euro area can be drawn. In 
total, for the 24 countries and territories in-
cluded in the study, there are data covering 
an average time period of more than 55 
years.3 To allow for comparison with cur-
rent developments, the analysis is limited to 
data up to the end of 2019.
A “debt phase” refers to a period in which 
the debt ratio rises on the previous year 
continually over three consecutive years 
and increases by a total of at least 10%.4 
Across all of the 24 countries and territories 
and their combined 1,320 years of data, a 
total of 41 debt phases can be identifi  ed. 
The median rise in the debt ratio per quar-
ter is just over 0.9 percentage point. The 
interquartile  distribution, i.e. the 25th to the 
75th percentile of the distribution, ranges 
from 0.6 to 1.2 percentage points. The min-
imum is 0.3 percentage point and the max-
imum is 3.2 percentage points.The chart on p. 41 depicts the development 
of the debt ratio in the private non- fi  nancial 
sector of the euro area and its four largest 
Member States since the outbreak of the 
coronavirus pandemic. This is shown against 
stylised debt paths, which are calculated 
based on changes in the debt ratios along 
the historical distribution described above. 
For reasons of simplicity, it is assumed here 
that the rise is linear and quarterly changes 
are cumulated. The light shaded area shows 
the minimums and maximums of previous 
debt phases, while the dark shaded area 
depicts the interquartile distribution. The 
dashed line represents the median of histor-
ical development.
Over the course of the second quarter of 
2020, the debt ratios rose to a historic de-
gree. While this growth was due in part to 
borrowing, particularly among non- fi  nancial 
corporations, the main driver was, however, 
the extraordinary drop in GDP . The debt 
ratios fi  rst began to rise less sharply as the 
economic recovery progressed. They were 
in decline again as of the fi  rst quarter of 
2021. At the end of the third quarter of 
1 The following data analysis serves only to derive styl-
ised descriptive facts. It cannot be used to draw con-
clusions on whether the build- up of debt is sustainable 
or fundamentally justifi  able. For more information, see 
Schularick and Taylor (2012) and Greenwood et al. 
(2022).

territories: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Den-
mark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, 
Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, 
Norway, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States. For the majority of these countries and 
territories, the length of their time series is very close 
to the average. The only downward and upward out-
liers are Hong Kong (40 years) and the United States 
(72 years).

Potential impact of interest 
rate normalisation on the 
debt situation
In light of current inflation developments, a po -
tential normalisation of monetary policy is on 
the horizon. This could also have an impact on 
the debt situation of the private non- financial 
sector. The debt service ratio is of particular 
interest in this context. Via interest payments, it 
is directly influenced by the general interest 
rate environment and therefore by monetary 
policy. The following depicts simulations of 
possible paths that the debt service ratio could 
take. These simulations are conducted for 
households and non-  financial corporations in 
the euro area as a whole, as well as for its four 
largest Member States. When calculating the 
debt service ratio, three variables are con -
sidered: the level of debt, the average rate of 
interest to be paid on this debt (average debt 
interest rate), and the level of disposable in -
come.15 For the simulations, either assumptions have to be made regarding the future develop -
ment of these variables or their development 
has to be projected using statistical models.
The level of households’ disposable income in 
the simulations is taken from the ECB staff 
macroeconomic projection exercises (MPEs) of 
March 2022.16 These projections make no fore -
casts for non- financial corporations’ disposable 
income. Instead, the relationship between 
nominal GDP growth and non- financial corpor -
ations’ disposable income is determined using 
a simple linear model. Separate estimates are 
made for the euro area and each of its four Monetary policy

debt ratio of the French private non- 
fi  nancial sector was at the upper edge of 
the historical distribution. It also remained 
relatively high in Spain, but was still within 
the interquartile distribution. For the euro 
area as a whole as well as Germany and 
Italy, it was just barely above the median. 
Assuming that the economic recovery con-
tinues, these rises will be put into even 
greater perspective over the coming years. 
Furthermore, the disposable income of the 
private non- fi  nancial sector, which is more 
relevant to debt sustainability, saw consid-
erably better development than GDP , which 
was used as the income fl  ow for this analy-
sis. Overall, the rise in the debt ratios of the 
private non- fi  nancial sector since the out-
break of the pandemic is indeed consider-
able, but not exceptional when viewed in 
historical perspective.Rise in the debt ratio of the private

15 Generally speaking, the residual maturities on the debt 
are also included in the calculation. However, no time ser -
ies are available for this variable. In the following, the re -
sidual debt maturity is accordingly always taken as con -
stant. For non- financial corporations, it is assumed to be 13 
years; for households, it is assumed to be 18 years. For the 
reasoning behind these residual maturities, see Bank for 
International Settlements (2017).

largest Member States. Using the forecasts of 
GDP growth, values are then calculated for dis -
posable income in the simulation period.
The development of the average debt interest 
rate is also derived from simple regression 
models. These regress the debt interest rate on 
the three- month EURIBOR (short- term market 
interest rate) and the (country- specific) ten- year 
interest rate on government debt (long- term 
market interest rate). In addition, the first two 
time lags of the debt interest rate and of both 
market interest rates are incorporated into the 
estimation equation. Using the estimation re -
sults, the development of the debt interest rate 
is then derived on the basis of the market inter -
est rate path assumed in the macroeconomic 
projections. Here, too, the calculations are per -
formed separately for the euro area as a whole 
and each of the four countries, as well as for 
households and non- financial corporations. 
The following simulations cover a period from 
the fourth quarter of 2021 to the end of 2024 
(end of the projection horizon in the March 
forecast). On the one hand, the start of this 
time period marks the current end of the data. 
On the other hand, financial markets began to 
increasingly price in an imminent normalisation 
of monetary policy over the course of the 
fourth quarter of 2021. The simulations differ -entiate between three scenarios (for more on 
this, see also the table above):
– Baseline scenario: Interest rates and dispos -
able income develop as depicted in the 
March 2022 macroeconomic projections. 
Debt increases with the historically high 
rates seen since the outbreak of the COVID- 
19 pandemic.
– Mild scenario: Interest rates and disposable 
income develop as depicted in the March 
2022 macroeconomic projections. However, 
debt is assumed to rise at the same average 
pace as between the start of 2010 and the 
end of 2019. In that period, debt saw con -
siderably weaker growth compared to the 
period following the outbreak of the pan -
demic. This scenario thus assumes a return 
to the trends that were seen in the wake of 
the global financial crisis.17
– Adverse scenario: Interest rates and dispos -
able income initially develop as depicted in 
the March 2022 macroeconomic projec -
tions. Debt increases with the historically 
high rates seen since the outbreak of the

euro area, both the short- term and long-  
term interest rates rise by 100 basis points 
more than assumed in the projections. In 
the scenarios for the four largest Member 
States, the short- term interest rates likewise 
climb by an additional 100 basis points. For 
the long- term interest rates, changes in the 
spread in yield between the individual coun -
tries and the euro area as a whole are twice 
as great as forecast in the macroeconomic 
projections.18 This scenario thus explores, in 
stylised form, how susceptible households 
and non- financial corporations are to an un -
expectedly steep rise in interest rates.
The left- hand side of the above chart shows 
the progression of the debt service ratio of 
euro area non- financial corporations in each of 
the three scenarios. The right- hand side of the 
chart shows the contributions to the cumula -
tive change made by the individual variables 
over the entire period. For comparative pur -
poses, the development seen during the last interest rate tightening cycle is also depicted

According to the simulations, the debt service 
ratio of non- financial corporations decreases 
over the entire period in all three scenarios. 
This means that the impact on the debt service

noticeably weaker than it was during the inter -

18 To begin with, higher interest rates have a direct impact 
on the debt interest rate of households and non- financial 
corporations. Additionally, the (negative) effect of rising 
interest rates on the development of disposable income is 
quantified using basic model elasticities (BMEs). These 
show how deviations of exogenous variables from the 
baseline assumptions impact on the forecasts.

rate effects are noticeably positive only in the 
adverse scenario. The significance of the contri -
butions of individual variables shifts over the 
projection horizon. For instance, in all three 
scenarios, the depressing effect of increasing 
income initially predominates. Over time, the 
impact of rising interest rates, which push up 
the debt service ratio, then becomes more pro -
nounced. This makes the debt service ratios de -
cline at first but rise again as of 2023 in the ad -
verse scenario.
For euro area households, the debt service ratio 
decreases only in the mild scenario (see the 
chart on p. 43). Even in the baseline scenario, 
however, it rises perceptibly. In the adverse 
scenario, this growth is markedly stronger still, 
although it lags behind the rise seen in the last 
interest rate tightening cycle. For households, 
too, the income growth generally provides re -
lief. Likewise, only in the adverse scenario do 
the direct effects on debt interest make a note -
worthy contribution to the increase in the debt service ratio. The accumulation of debt, how -
ever, increases the debt service ratio markedly 
in each of the scenarios. The individual contri -
butions develop similarly to those of non-  
financial corporations over the projection hori -
zon.
At the level of the four largest Member States, 
the two sectors exhibit substantial differences 
across all of the countries (see the adjacent 
chart). However, it is important to note that 
these differences hinge on assumptions made 
about debt developments. Particularly in 
France, borrowing makes a significantly posi -
tive contribution. This is due to the fact that 
the indebtedness of both households and non- 
financial corporations has been noticeably in -
creasing for quite some time. The simulations 
extrapolate this trend by way of assumption. In 
Italy and Spain, by contrast, debt growth has 
been relatively weak, particularly prior to the 
outbreak of the pandemic. Its contributions in 
both sectors are correspondingly low in the 
simulations. In Germany, only households have 
expanded their borrowing significantly, which 
is reflected in the accordingly large contribu -
tions made by debt.
For non- financial corporations in Germany and 
Italy, the debt service ratio declines even in the 
adverse scenario. In France, on the other hand, 
it increases in all three scenarios, with the rise 
being particularly pronounced in the adverse 
scenario. For non- financial corporations in 
Spain, the debt service ratio increases only in 
the adverse scenario. In the case of households 
in France, by contrast, it rises in every scenario, 
and to a relatively strong degree at that. In 
Italy, the debt service ratio increases even in the 
baseline scenario. However, growth is note -
worthy only in the adverse scenario – here, risk 
premia on Italian government bonds increase 
to a more significant extent. As a result, debt 
interest rates also climb by a noticeably larger 
amount. Households in Germany and Spain re -

ments at the country level follow similar paths 
to those of the euro area.
The simulation results are naturally subject to 
some degree of uncertainty. The war in Ukraine, 
in particular, is likely to alter the development 
of the variables used in the simulations. For ex -
ample, real economic metrics could be lower 
than assumed in the March 2022 macro-
economic projections. Conversely, prices are 
likely to rise more steeply than projected. Scen -
ario calculations indicate that the additional 
price pressures are likely to be greater than the 
losses sustained by the real economy.20 This 
would tend to push up nominal income flows 
somewhat and mitigate developments in the 
debt service ratio. At the same time, the ex -
pected interest rate paths have significantly in -
creased relative to the time at which the pro -
jections were made. However, the assumptions 
for debt developments tend to have been set 
rather high. A normalisation of interest rates 
could also lead to credit demand tailing off. 
This, taken in isolation, would decrease the 
debt service ratios or at least depress their 
growth. Overall, this means that the impact of 
the war in Ukraine on the development of debt 
service ratios is yet to be determined.
Summary and conclusions
Overall, the debt situation of the private non-  
financial sector has not deteriorated substan -
tially since the outbreak of the coronavirus pan -
demic. Asset- based debt indicators such as le -
verage and the debt coverage ratio mostly saw 
relatively positive developments in both sectors 
in all of the countries under review. By contrast, 
income- based indicators such as the debt ratio 
and the debt service ratio largely deteriorated. 
In addition, simulations of the debt service ratio 
on the basis of the ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections from March 2022 indicate that the 
expected normalisation of monetary policy will 
not unduly exacerbate the debt situation of 
households and non- financial corporations.Not only the changes in debt indicators but 
also their absolute levels are relevant for eco -
nomic policy.21 Previous Bundesbank analyses 
have demonstrated that debt levels can influ -
ence the effectiveness of monetary policy in 
the euro area.22 For instance, if debt levels are

policy shock. By contrast, if debt levels are low, 
investment and consumption respond relatively 
weakly. The chart on p.  45 shows whether 
non- financial corporations and households are 
currently in a high- debt or low- debt state. To 
this end, country- specific threshold values are 
deducted from the current levels of each debt 
indicator. The thresholds are determined using 
a specific percentile that maximises the ex -
planatory power of the underlying econometric 
panel model. The sectoral percentile calculated 
in this manner is ultimately applied to each in -
dividual country, producing country- specific 
threshold values for the debt indicators. If the 
current level of the debt indicator lies above 
the threshold value, this suggests a high level 
of debt. Current values below the threshold 
value point to a low level of debt.23
The results of the calculations essentially reflect 
the changes documented above since the start of the pandemic: non- financial corporations’ 
debt ratios are currently relatively high across 
the board. In the case of households, this ap -
plies only to France. By contrast, the debt cov -
erage ratio across all countries and both sec -
tors consistently indicates a low- debt state. 
With regard to the debt service ratio, the cur -
rent values are, for the most part, fairly close to 
or below the threshold and therefore send a 
mixed signal. All things considered, it is unlikely 
that the private non- financial sector will cut 
back significantly on its spending on account of 
the current debt situation in response to a 
tightening of monetary policy.

Central government’s debt brake: options 
for stability- oriented further development
Fiscal rules are designed to ensure sound government finances. They require that budget priorities 
be set and allow only limited deferral of financial burdens to the future. From the Bundesbank’s 
perspective, binding fiscal rules are indispensable for both the euro area and Germany. This is 
because sound government finances protect stability- oriented monetary policy. Furthermore, they 
preserve fiscal policymakers’ capacity to act – even in times of crisis. For example, the debt brake 
helped put government finances in a favourable starting position prior to the coronavirus crisis.
There are currently plans to enshrine a debt- financed special fund for the German armed forces 
outside the scope of the debt brake in the country’s Basic Law. As this will require a broad parlia -
mentary majority to pass, it is unlikely to set a precedent of weakening the binding effect of the 
debt brake. Measures that bend the rules of the debt brake are more problematic in this regard. 
For instance, during the coronavirus crisis the Federal Government used the escape clause to pro -
vide advance funding on a substantial scale to future government projects with no direct connec -
tion to the pandemic. The Federal Government announced that compliance with the standard 
limit under the debt brake would resume from 2023. Additionally, it has resolved to carry out a 
review of the cyclical adjustment procedure used in the context of the debt brake.
A specific change to the cyclical adjustment procedure is proposed in this article. Under this pro -
posal, budgetary policy has more time to adjust in the event of revisions to expected economic 
developments and tax revenue forecast errors. This would make it easier to stabilise budgetary 
policy and avoid procyclical stimuli.
Various adjustments to the debt brake are also discussed in this article. They have been selected 
such that the debt brake continues to ensure sound government finances and the framework is 
compatible with European fiscal rules. In contrast to the increasingly flexible manner in which the 
debt brake is being used, such reforms could reinforce its binding effect. Specifically, budgetary 
developments could be stabilised by recording interest expenditure on an accruals basis. In add -
ition, credit balances on the control account resulting from not borrowing up to the borrowing 
limit could be netted against emergency loans. A more radical move would be to raise the stand -
ard borrowing limit under the debt brake from 0.35% of gross domestic product (GDP) up to the 
medium- term budgetary objectives set out under European rules, according to which countries 
may have a structural general government deficit ratio of 0.5%, rising to a figure of 1% if they 
have debt- to- GDP ratios of under 60%. Investment could be prioritised over consumption expend -
iture by means of a “capped golden rule”. It would be important to link this rule to net investment 
and maintain caps on new borrowing that are compatible with stability. It would also appear fit -
ting with stability- oriented policy to cancel repayment obligations from earlier crises once the 
debt ratio is back below the 60% mark and is expected to remain so in future fiscal plans. In prin -
ciple, it would be consistent to include Germany’s shares in EU deficits in the debt brake in future.Deutsche Bundesbank

Safeguard debt brake, 
make use of room for 
improvement 
The debt brake has contributed to sound gov -
ernment finances over the past decade. In re -
sponse to the global financial crisis, central and 
state governments agreed in early 2009 to 
write it into Germany’s Basic Law.1 It replaced 
an investment- linked borrowing limit, which 
had failed to effectively keep the debt ratio 
under control. By contrast, the debt brake 
proved successful. The debt ratio fell consider -
ably once central government’s debt brake had 
entered into force. Germany also complied 
with the European rule of keeping the struc -
tural budgetary position close to balance. It 
was in no small part thanks to the debt brake 
that the central government budget was in a 
favourable starting position prior to the corona -
virus crisis. Fiscal policy was thus able to play a 
major stabilising role during the crisis and keep 
the economic damage inflicted by the pan -
demic to a minimum. Trust in Germany’s public 
finances was at no point jeopardised.
The Federal Government has embraced the 
debt brake. It is planning to resume compliance 
with the standard borrowing limit from next 
year, with structural2 net borrowing then being 
once again limited to 0.35% of GDP . However, 
the Federal Government is adopting various 
measures to create a considerable amount of 
additional room in the budget, which will en -
able it de facto to borrow above the standard 
limit, taking out sizeable loans to finance its 
projects over the next few years.
Amongst other things, the Federal Government 
is planning to take on new debt to cover areas 
of defence spending where there is consider -
able catching- up to do. To this end, it wishes to 
enshrine a new special fund for Germany’s 
armed forces in the Basic Law, to which debt 
brake requirements shall not apply. This will re -
quire support from a major part of the oppos -
ition. This major hurdle is likely to prevent the 
special fund from setting a precedent of weak -ening the binding effect of the debt brake on a 
lasting basis. Other measures are more prob -
lematic in this regard. For example, the Federal 
Government used the escape clause to enable 
it, in the coming years, to borrow in order to 
finance extensive measures not serving directly 
to overcome the acute crisis situation.3 In con -
nection with this, some in the opposition have 
asked the Federal Constitutional Court to re -
view the second supplementary central govern -
ment budget for 2021. Furthermore, the Fed -
eral Government wishes to amend the repay -
ment schedules already arranged for emer -
gency loans.4 Rather than starting in this 
legislative period, repayments would then be 
put off until far into the next legislative period.5
All in all, central government intends to spend 
around 5% of GDP outside the debt brake 
framework by these means in the coming 
years. In the case of a drawdown of this add -
itional scope for borrowing, the debt brake 
alone will no longer be able to ensure compli -
ance with the EU rules on structural balances.
If fiscal rules are to ensure sound government 
finances, they have to tie in with specific re -
quirements. Their binding effect is weakened if Debt brake

2 Structural components in central government’s debt 
brake are adjusted for financial asset acquisitions and cyc -
lical effects.
3 To this end, amongst other things, special funds that are 
pre- funded using emergency borrowing from the central 
government budget were retroactively exempted from the 
constraints imposed by the debt brake. For detailed explan -
ations of these measures, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022).
4 Under the Basic Law, decisions on emergency borrowing 
must be combined with a repayment schedule.
5 It was also announced in the coalition agreement that 
more investment would take place via the balance sheets 
of public entities. These are outside the scope of the debt 
brake. Financial transactions, which likewise do not count 
towards the debt brake, could if necessary be used to 
strengthen enterprises’ capital base. However, the latest 
budget plans do not contain any such transactions that 
would run counter to the debt brake. In any event, the 
European fiscal rules cover investment by public entities 
where, as a general rule, from an economic perspective the 
investment belongs to the general government sector. For 
information on the requirements for outsourcing central 
government investment from the government sector, see

they are circumvented or applied with exces -
sive flexibility. But this does not mean that the 
debt brake cannot be reformed. Changes to 
the basic rules make sense where there is sig -
nificant room for improvement. In this respect, 
it is understandable, for example, that the Fed -
eral Government wishes to review the cyclical 
adjustment procedure used in the context of 
the debt brake. From the Bundesbank’s per -
spective, it is important that any changes to the 
basic rules be made transparently and in a 
manner that maintains stability. With this in 
mind, this article first presents a proposal for 
amending the cyclical adjustment procedure, 
before discussing various ways in which other 
parts of the debt brake could be enhanced.
Amend the cyclical adjust -
ment procedure: respond 
to revised assessments with 
a delay
The cyclical adjustment procedure is used to 
estimate how economic activity influences the 
central government budget. Under the debt 
brake, higher levels of new borrowing are per -
mitted when the economic situation puts pres -
sure on the budget, whereas a scenario in 
which the economic situation eases said pres -
sure lowers the permissible new borrowing 
amount. The debt brake therefore takes into 
account the fact that revenue and expenditure 
“breathe” over the economic cycle: for ex -
ample, taxes rise and spending on unemploy -
ment falls during upswings and do the oppos -
ite during downswings. This breathing mech -
anism automatically stabilises aggregate eco -
nomic activity. Budgetary policy can follow a 
steadier course if cyclical fluctuations are 
allowed to affect the budget, as measures then 
do not need to be implemented to offset the 
fluctuations.
The standard limit for net borrowing by central 
government under the debt brake is a struc -
tural value of 0.35% of GDP . This limit thus spe -
cifies a path for government debt that cyclical adjustment is not permitted to systematically 
alter. The cyclical impact on the budget there -
fore needs be taken into account symmetric -
ally, which means that higher new borrowing 
during periods of weak cyclical conditions has 
to be offset by lower new borrowing when the 
economy is stronger. As a result, cyclical adjust -
ment has no longer- term impact on the debt 
path. This symmetry requirement is enshrined 
in the Basic Law.
Major revisions to estimates of aggregate po -
tential output in the context of cyclical adjust -
ment or taxes pose a significant challenge to 
the debt brake because they can lead to erratic 
fiscal policy.6 If, for example, expected GDP 
growth is revised downwards, central govern -
ment’s cyclical adjustment procedure usually 
registers this as cyclical only to a certain extent. 
The procedure interprets a large part as an 
overestimation of potential output.7 This usu -
ally means that cyclically adjusted taxes are re -
vised downwards and structural net borrowing 
is revised upwards accordingly. To the extent 
that the standard limit of the debt brake would 
be exceeded as a result, this then needs to be 
offset in the next budget plan. An additional 
problem is posed by profit- related taxes, in par -
ticular. Revenue collected from profit- related 
taxes fluctuates to some extent as it moves in 
line with economic activity, and it often differs 
fairly substantially from expectations. For ex -
ample, tax prepayments are adjusted in relation 
to the relevant macroeconomic variables in 
very different ways, and they vary over time. 
For this reason, cyclical adjustment procedures 
based on potential output classify the some -
times strong fluctuations in revenue from 
profit- related taxes as largely structural. In re -
sponse to positive swings, the rules permit fis -Stability-

cal policy to become more expansionary, 
whereas it becomes accordingly tighter in re -
sponse to negative ones. There is thus a risk of 
the budgetary stance becoming volatile and 
potentially procyclical.
The Bundesbank has already presented pro -
posals in the past as to how to address these 
issues with cyclical adjustment and erratic tax 
developments. For example, safety buffers can 
be maintained in a targeted manner that would 
serve as a shock absorber in the event of the 
assessment of the structural budgetary position 
being downgraded.8 However, this tends to 
make budgetary policy more ambitious than in -
tended by the debt brake. Existing reserves are 
also often not set aside as buffers to cover such 
unexpected developments. Instead, they are 
fully allocated. While central government keeps 
fiscal policy steady partly through careful 
budget planning, this makes planning opaque 
and difficult to understand. A rule- based ap -
proach would therefore be preferable.
This article outlines a proposal to build on the 
current cyclical adjustment procedure that 
would involve a delayed response to revisions 
to the cyclically adjusted tax level. If the (ex -
pected) level is revised downwards, fiscal policy 
only has to gradually adapt to the tighter fiscal 
framework, and if it is revised upwards, it is 
able to make use of the larger fiscal framework 
only gradually. In this way, sudden changes to 
the budget following unexpected develop -
ments can be avoided.
The cyclical adjustment procedure would thus 
deviate from the procedure underpinning the 
EU rules. It is possible under EU rules to adjust 
with a certain delay to unexpected negative 
developments. However, such adjustments 
could adversely affect the ability of national 
rules to safeguard compliance with EU rules. If 
the procedure were reformed in this manner, it 
would be even more important for the Stability 
Council to take action in the event of foresee -
able non- compliance with EU rules (see also 
pp. 62 f.).The section on cyclical adjustment is structured 
as follows: first, the reform proposal is set out, 
after which it is compared with the existing ap -
proach with regard to consistent budget plan -
ning, countercyclical impact and symmetry of 
cyclical components.
Description of the reform 
 proposal
A budget for year t first appears four years 
earlier  in the medium- term fiscal plan (i.e. in 
year t- 4). In the year prior to the fiscal year 
(t- 1), the draft budget is usually approved in 
spring and the budget plan in autumn. Plan -
ning is based on a current, newly estimated 
cyclical adjustment and a current tax estimate. 
Revisions to estimates therefore change the 
possible expenditure framework. Ultimately, 
the plan has be based on the latest assess -
ments.
The reform proposal discussed in this article 
adds an error component to the existing pro -
cedure for cyclical adjustment (see also the 
model calculation and methodological notes 
on pp.  53 and  55). Under the proposal, the 
cyclical component for a fiscal year consists of 
two parts. Together, they produce the cyclical 
scope for borrowing:
– Standard cyclical component: This reflects 
the economic assessment at the current 
point in time. It corresponds to the cyclical 
component that central government cur -
rently uses in the budget planning phase.
– Error component: Revisions to cyclically ad -
justed taxes are factored into this compon -
ent in a graduated manner (here and below: Safety margins

Cyclical component in the fi  scal and budgetary plans under 
the reform proposal: a model calculation
The table below shows, by way of illustration, 
the cyclical components under the reform 
proposal for the 2006 fi  scal year. The medium- 
term fi  scal plan from 2002 contained the fi  rst 
planning for 2006. This means that the fi  rst 
time it would have been possible to deter-
mine a cyclical component for 2006 would be 
for the 2002 fi  scal plan (in May 2002).
The estimates for taxes in 2006 (item 1) were 
revised downwards signifi  cantly over time.1 
The reform proposal takes into account the 
revisions to the offi   cial tax estimates excluding 
legislative changes implemented in the mean-
time (see p. 55 for sources and methodology).
The cyclical component (item 2) consists of 
two parts:
– The standard cyclical component (item 2.1): 
this undergoes much less revision over time 
than taxes.
– The error component (item 2.2): the down-
ward revision of the tax estimates given lit-
tle change to the standard cyclical com-
ponent leads to an increasing error com-
ponent. Of the revision of adjusted taxes, 
25% is taken into account in May 2003 
versus May 2002, 50% in May 2004 versus 
2003, 75% in May 2005 versus 2004 and 100% in November 2005 versus May 
2005. The error component allows us to 
budget for high cyclical debt (cyclical com-
ponent) for the 2006 fi  scal year in the 
budget plan from November 2005.
Cyclically adjusted taxes are calculated by de-
ducting the cyclical component from taxes:
– The adjusted taxes estimated for 2006 
(item 3) fi  rst have to be revised downwards 
from plan to plan. The unchanged fi  gure 
from May 2005 is then budgeted in the 
plan. The error component considerably re-
duces the revisions to adjusted taxes com-
pared with unadjusted taxes.
– In addition, the revisions to adjusted taxes 
are much smaller than under the current 
procedure (item 4), as that only deducts 
the standard cyclical component. The 
heavier revisions make it harder to make 
stable plans, as these have to be compen-
sated for elsewhere in each case (if there 
are no available buffers or similar).
1 The result was then, in turn, much more favourable 
than the regular estimate for the budget plan (of No-
vember 2005).

excluding interim changes in tax law9). Re-
vising cyclically adjusted taxes downwards 
from a previous estimate increases the error 
component, allowing for more borrowing. 
Upward revisions cause the error compon -
ent and the scope for borrowing to de -
crease. Graduating the extent to which revi -
sions are factored into the component ac -
counts for the time between the date of re -
vision and the fiscal year concerned: the 
closer the date of revision is to the fiscal 
year, the more it is factored in. This means 
that revision is excused to a greater extent 
and does not have to be compensated for in 
planning.
 Specifically, calculation of the error compon -
ent for year t starts with the fiscal planning 
four years before this fiscal year. This is the 
first year in which a plan for t is prepared. It 
is based on the tax estimate from May of 
year t- 4. From that point onwards, the revi -
sions to cyclically adjusted taxes for this fis -
cal year t are factored into the error com -
ponent proportionally as follows:
 Revisions to the estimate
– from May of year t- 3 versus May t-4: 
25% is taken into account;
– from May of year t- 2 versus May t-3: 50%;
– from May of year t- 1 versus May t-2: 75%;
– for the final budget plan (November of 
year t- 1) versus May t- 1: 100%.
When the budget for year t is approved, the 
cyclical scope for borrowing is the product of 
the standard cyclical component updated to 
this point in time plus the updated error com -
ponent.
In the next year’s budget accounting, the cyc -
lically adjusted tax figure is frozen at the level 
calculated during planning. This means that all 
deviations from the cyclically adjusted taxes estimated in the budget plan that are not based 
on changes in tax law are considered to be cyc -
lical. The level of structural net borrowing real -
ised thus remains unaffected by unexpected 
developments of this nature during budget 
execution.10
Reform objective: facilitate 
stable budgetary policy
The reform proposal makes budget planning 
more robust to forecast errors. Unlike in the 
current procedure, a sudden downward revi -
sion of the cyclically adjusted tax level widens 
the scope for borrowing temporarily. This buys 
more time to adapt the budget to unexpected 
events. By the same token, the reform proposal 
also ensures that an unexpected upward revi -
sion of the cyclically adjusted tax level does not 
widen the scope for borrowing immediately, 
but with a delay. It is important that sudden 
downward and upward revisions of cyclically 
adjusted taxes balance each other out over 
time. Otherwise structural debt may rise by a 
greater amount than permitted under the debt 
brake. Measures to prevent this are described 
in the section entitled “Safeguard symmetry” 
(pp. 57 ff.).
A simulation (see the chart on p.  56) shows 
that the reform proposal is indeed better suited 
to keeping budget planning and budgetary 
policy stable than the current procedure.11 To 
determine this, both procedures were applied Error compon -

9 The procedure focuses on unexpected developments. If 
tax law changes are adopted between two tax estimates, 
the associated revision is not unexpected and is not taken 
into account in the error component. If the actual effects 
of the change in law deviate from the estimated effect, this 
deviation is reflected in the actual outcome. Assuming real -
istic estimates of the effect of the change in law, this devi -
ation is unexpected. It is therefore included in the error 
component in budget accounting.

states receiving consolidation assistance.

Methodological notes
Data
The calculations are based on the offi   cial 
tax estimates for central government. The 
data are taken from press releases issued by 
the Federal Ministry of Finance. Information 
on the relevant tax estimates and changes 
to tax law were used. The Federal Govern-
ment’s forecasts of gross domestic product 
(GDP) released in April and October of a 
given year were used to determine cyclical 
components and cyclical position.
Cyclical position
Cyclical fl  uctuations in real GDP are esti-
mated using a Hodrick- Prescott fi  lter (HP 
fi  lter ) with a smoothing parameter of 100. 
The HP fi  lter is used for practical reasons: 
real- time estimates using central govern-
ment’s production function approach are 
available only as from 2011. The output 
gaps derived from this do not differ materi-
ally from the GDP trend deviations used 
here. In other words, an analysis using the 
central government approach for the years 
from 2011 onwards arrives at similar results.
Cyclical component of central 
government  taxes
Given a real GDP trend deviation of 1%, the 
cyclical component of taxes is estimated at 
1.37% of tax revenue. Central government 
currently uses this elasticity for the cyclical 
adjustment of taxes.1
Cyclical component of central 
 government labour market expenditure
Central government’s cyclical adjustment 
also assumes cyclical components for its 
labour  market expenditure. These are small, however, and would be the same in the 
reform  proposal. They are therefore disre-
garded in this analysis.
Central government budget preparation 
only considered in stylised form
For the budgets, the following is assumed 
in the calculations for the sake of simplicity:
– The draft budgets of specifi  c years are 
each based on the Federal Government’s 
tax estimate and GDP estimate from 
spring of the previous year.
– The budget plans are based on the Fed-
eral Government’s tax estimate and GDP 
estimate from autumn of the previous 
year.
This means that time lags owing to federal 
elections or adjustments in supplementary 
budgets are disregarded. Equally, discre-
tionary add- ons to or deductions from the 
tax estimate which are occasionally ob-
served in the budget plans are not con-
sidered. Furthermore, to simplify matters, it 
is assumed that no revenue effects stem-
ming from legal changes – whether relating 
to taxes or in the form of global items – are 
planned in (although appropriations for this 
can at least close gaps during budget prep-
aration relatively easily).

to budget planning for the period from 2002 
to 2021, retrospectively and stylised in real 
time. The chart shows how the expected cyclic -
ally adjusted tax level in the planning years dif -
fers at various estimation points prior to the re -
spective fiscal years (for methodological notes, 
see p. 55).
The simulation shows that cyclically adjusted 
taxes undergo much more revision between 
two planning periods under the current pro -
cedure than with the reform proposal. Revi -
sions for the budget plan (i.e. between May t- 1 
and November t- 1), too, are extensive at times 
under the current procedure (see the right-  
hand box plot in the chart above). In the case 
of a downward revision without provisions 
elsewhere, the government has to find com -
pensation at short notice. However, this is not 
necessary with the reform proposal: the error 
component widens the scope for cyclically in -
duced borrowing. Between May t- 1 and May 
t- 2 (second box plot from right), too, revisions are much lower under the reform proposal. 
The differences are smaller for revisions dating 
further back because the supplementary error 
component attributes less weight to revisions 
in earlier planning years. In such cases, how -
ever, fiscal policymakers also have a number of 
years (until year t) to gradually compensate for 
the unexpected development.
Reform objective: facilitate 
countercyclical budgetary 
stance
The aim of cyclical adjustment is for the debt 
limit to expand when the economy is in poor 
shape and tighten in good times. This is de -
signed to mitigate cyclical fluctuations by way 
of deficits in a downturn and surpluses in an 
upturn.
The reform proposal has a beneficial effect in 
this respect in situations where cyclical adjust -
ment results in a more countercyclical develop -
ment of the scope for borrowing. This is the 
case if revisions of cyclically adjusted taxes tend 
to be procyclical, as the reform proposal then 
widens the cyclically permitted scope for bor -
rowing in a downturn and restricts it in an up -
turn (compared with the current procedure). 
The benefits can be seen particularly clearly in a 
sharper downturn in which potential output 
and cyclically adjusted taxes are revised down -
wards. Under the current procedure, such cases 
require a correction in the next budget. Under 
the reform proposal, by contrast, the adjust -
ment can be stretched over a number of years. 
Simulations using historical data show that the 
reform proposal would have been better suited 
to stabilising the economy than the current 
procedure (see pp. 58 ff.).Reform proposal

Safeguard symmetry
It is imperative that cyclically permissible bor -
rowing does not lead to a systematic build- up 
of debt. Germany’s Basic Law stipulates that 
cyclical debt in a downturn has to be offset by 
cyclical surpluses in an upturn.
To ensure that the cyclical components are off -
set over time in the reform procedure, it is not 
just the standard cyclical components (and 
with them the estimated output gaps) that 
need to be symmetrical over time. The supple -
mentary error components also have to be 
symmetrical. This tends to be the case when 
upward and downward revisions of the cyclic -
ally adjusted tax estimates (excluding changes 
to tax law) balance out over time. Studies indi -
cate that tax estimates in Germany are un -
biased over a longer period of time,12 meaning 
that forecast errors balance each other out on 
average. This is likely due in part to the fact 
that these estimates factor in independent spe -
cialist expertise. Tax estimates are prepared by 
an independent group of tax estimators (Work -
ing Party on Tax Revenue Estimates). They are 
based on the Federal Government’s macro-
economic projection which, for some years 
now, has been validated by the Joint Economic 
Forecast. The Federal Ministry of Finance esti -
mates the effects of changes in tax law. This 
area is not checked as thoroughly. It is there -
fore possible that there is a certain political 
interest in exploiting discretionary scope in 
some years. It would therefore be worth con -
sidering having an independent body conduct 
a plausibility check on the estimated impact of 
legislative changes.13
However, irrespective of independent checks, 
there are always times when cyclically adjusted 
taxes are repeatedly over or underestimated. 
The chart above shows the cyclically induced 
debt permitted under both procedures over 
time. The figures contained in the chart are 
stylised accumulated fiscal balances calculated 
using the procedures (see the box on pp. 58 ff.). 
In the model calculation, up to 2006 the re -form proposal results in much higher debt than 
the current procedure. This is due to pro -
nounced downward revisions of cyclically ad -
justed tax estimates which permit higher debt 
via the error component. At its peak, debt 
amounts to almost 4% of GDP under the re -
form procedure; that is just over 3 percentage 
points more than in the current procedure. 
After that, surpluses dominate in both proced -
ures. As a result, debt comes back down and, 
ultimately, the accounts are in credit in both 
procedures.
If government finances are sound overall, tem -
porary debt of just over 4% of GDP does not 
pose a risk to stability. However, it appears 
worthwhile to document the cyclically induced 
surpluses and deficits of a procedure. A rule 
could be adopted stipulating that gradual cor -
rection is required if debt surpasses a certain 
threshold. It might also be worth giving 
thought to additionally posting the cyclical 
components to the control account and signifi -
cantly upping the threshold there.Cyclical

Simulations of the countercyclical effect of the reform 
 proposal
This box contains a stylised depiction of the 
surpluses or defi  cits that are calculated 
using the current and reformed procedures 
for the years 2002 to 2020. The sole focus 
is on the effect of differences in the proced-
ures. No consideration is given to scope for 
borrowing under the standard limit, for ex-
ample, or any other budgetary develop-
ments.
The analysis is based on budget outturns. 
To this end, the following is assumed:
– In the budget plans for a fi  scal year, the 
cyclical borrowing potential (defi  cits or 
surpluses) is budgeted in each case ac-
cording to the respective procedure. The 
reform procedure differs from the cur-
rent one in that it also includes the error component (see p. 55 for the calculation 
method for the cyclical component).
– In the budget execution phase, tax rev-
enue forecast errors as against the plan 
feed through in full to the budget out-
turn under both procedures. For ex-
ample, if taxes develop less favourably 
than estimated in the budget plan, the 
budget outturn is accordingly less fa-
vourable.1
The chart on this page shows the defi  cits 
and surpluses calculated under these as-
sumptions using the current and reformed 
procedures. It also depicts a current esti-
mate of the trend deviation of real GDP as 
an indicator of the cyclical position. Com-
pared with the current procedure, defi  cits 
and surpluses fl  uctuate more strongly on 
average under the reform procedure:
– In particular, this is evident in the higher 
defi  cits in the cyclically weak years of 
2003 to 2005 as well as in the higher 
1 The reform procedure explicitly exculpates these 
forecast errors in the budget implementation phase 
(and adds an error component as part of the cyclical 
component). The current procedure is treated similarly 
here in this respect. In actual fact, the methodology 
under the current procedure is more complex. For sup-
plementary budgets (with scope for borrowing ex-
panded to a limited extent for forecast errors) and in 
the Federal Government’s budget account, the cyclical 
component is updated using a simplifi  ed procedure 
(see Federal Ministry of Finance (2022), p. 22). The de-
viations from the standard limit remaining after this are 
then recorded in the control account. However, this 
technical budgetary accounting plays no signifi  cant 
role in the present analysis of the countercyclical 
budgetary stance. At most, differences may arise if 
higher negative control account balances lead to a 
need for adjustment or very high unexpected defi  cits 
occur during budget implementation. Under the cur-
rent procedure, action is taken against this. It is likely 
that the stabilising properties in the economic cycle 
would then tend to be even less favourable.Fiscal balance and cyclical position

surpluses in the cyclically strong years of 
2017 to 2019.
– Under the reform procedure, there are 
no defi  cits in the crisis years of 2009 and 
2010. This is because the error compon-
ent was strongly positive the year before, 
in 2008 (owing to positive unexpected 
developments in preceding years). How-
ever, the reform procedure allows for the 
balance to deteriorate in 2009 to a simi-
lar extent as the current procedure. In 
years of crisis such as this, use would 
probably have been made of emergency 
borrowing in any case.
– In the period from 2011 to 2015, the re-
form proposal generates higher sur-
pluses than the current procedure. Cyc-
lical fl  uctuations in GDP were not espe-
cially large, though the labour market 
developed favourably. Tax developments 
were better than expected. During these 
years, budgetary policy was not experi-
encing adjustment pressure, but rather 
had more scope on the whole.2
The effect of government fi  nances on cyc-
lical developments is often measured by 
how the fi  scal balance (defi  cit or surplus) 
changes compared with the previous year. 
The change in the unadjusted fi  scal balance 
encompasses both the automatic stabilisers 
and the fi  scal stance above and beyond 
that.
The chart on this page depicts scatter plots 
for the current and reformed procedures. 
Each one compares the changes in the fi  s-
cal balance yielded by the procedures with 
the cyclical position (estimated from today’s 
perspective). In this stylised depiction, a 
procedure has a countercyclical effect if the 
change in the fi  scal balance is positively cor-
related with the cyclical position. In other 
words, this is the case if an increasing sur-plus is recorded in a good cyclical position 
(overutilisation). The above chart indicates 
procyclical developments in certain years 
for both the reform proposal and the cur-
rent procedure (the upper- left and lower- 
right quadrants in each scatter plot). Over-
all, however, the reform proposal is more 
countercyclical and thus more cyclically ap-
propriate than the current procedure.
2 Added to this were surprisingly favourable results for 
labour market expenditure and interest expenditure. 
This is disregarded here.Change in fiscal balance and cyclical

It can also be shown whether the proced-
ures would have supported a countercycli-
cal stance above and beyond the automatic 
stabilisers. The basic idea is this: due to 
forecast errors, the fi  scal balance resulting 
from each procedure deviates from the cur-
rent estimate of the automatic stabilisers. If 
this deviation is positive in an upturn and 
negative in a downturn, the respective pro-
cedure permits a fi  scal policy (fi  scal stance) 
that amplifi  es the working of the automatic 
stabilisers.
The above chart contains scatter plots illus-
trating this relationship. It is evident that the reform procedure facilitates a counter-
cyclical stance in most years, which would 
have amplifi  ed the working of the auto-
matic stabilisers. Under the current proced-
ure, on the other hand, the working of the 
automatic stabilisers is restricted in most 
cases. That means that the current proced-
ure would have tended to support a procy-
clical fi  scal stance.3
3 The fi  scal stance is a commonly used indicator for 
cyclically appropriate fi  scal policy. However, it should 
be interpreted with caution when it comes to its stabil-
ising effect. Indeed, the specifi  c macroeconomic im-
pact of the fi  scal stance can only be estimated with a 
considerable degree of uncertainty. For example, lags 
in the effects of fi  scal stimuli play an important role. 
The effects also depend on the revenue and expend-
iture categories behind them. For more details, see

Interest expenditure: allocate 
premia and discounts on an 
accruals basis
Interest expenditure is currently recorded in the 
budget as and when payment is made.14 A 
security’s bond coupon is thus booked at the 
time when interest is paid. Furthermore, when 
a security is issued, there are often mark- downs 
or mark- ups on the nominal value (discounts or 
premia). These offset the differences between 
the interest coupon and the market interest 
rate over the entire term and can be extremely 
high for long- dated securities. These compen -
satory payments are currently recognised in full 
at the time of issue. Any premia received, for 
instance, are immediately deducted from inter -
est expenditure. Since the debt brake was 
introduced, premia have clearly predominated. 
De facto, this has increased the scope for bor -
rowing under the debt brake in recent years.
It would be better to allocate discounts and 
premia over the entire term of a security and 
thus on an accruals basis. This ensures that 
structural budgetary developments are re -
corded appropriately from an economic per -
spective, stabilises interest burdens and thus 
also makes budget planning easier. Premia are 
highly volatile and to date have often meant 
that the budget outturn has been way off the 
budget estimate. Over the short term, it is cur -
rently also possible to make targeted use of 
coupons above market value to create fiscal 
space. However, this would come at the cost of 
scope at future coupon dates. Booking premia 
on an accruals basis also considerably reduces 
deviations from budget plans. The same natur -
ally applies in the other direction for discounts, 
i.e. lower proceeds from issuing securities with 
coupons below the market interest rate. This 
scenario becomes more relevant if long- dated 
securities are issued in multiple tranches in 
times of rising interest rates. If these discounts 
are then booked on an accruals basis instead, 
this rules out potentially large one- off strains 
from discounts that are almost impossible to 
foresee. Last but not least, changing over to accruals- based accounting comes closer to the 
method used in the national accounts, which 
are key for the European fiscal rules.
This way of booking interest expenditure can 
be applied not just for future issuance but also 
for issuance that has already taken place. This 
would make sense because these past issues 
still have an impact on budgetary develop -
ments today. High premia have been recorded 
in some cases in recent years. If these are then 
allocated on an accruals basis, the amount re -
corded for net borrowing in the past is too low. 
For budget years without use of the escape 
clause, this can be offset by lower positive 
bookings on the control account. The credit 
balance on the control account is then lower as 
a result. At the same time, this eases the strain 
on future budgets: after allocation on an ac -
cruals basis, premia lower interest expenditure 
over the entire term of the securities. This im -
pact lasts for just over two decades and then 
diminishes as the securities fall due.
Control account: repay 
 emergency loans using 
credit balance
The aim of the control account is to prevent a 
systematic infringement of the standard limit 
under the debt brake during budget execution. 
Debt may not grow at a stronger pace than 
permitted under the standard limit. To ensure 
this, the control account records annual posi -
tive and negative deviations from the standard 
limit during budget execution.15 If these in -
fringements of the standard limit add up to 
more than 1.5% of GDP on balance, this has to 
be corrected going forward. To this end, struc -
tural net borrowing must remain below the 
standard limit of 0.35% of GDP in future 
budgets. However, as structural net borrowing 
was clearly below the standard limit in all years Interest expend -

up until 2019, the control account has a credit 
balance of €48 billion (1.3% of GDP). This type 
of credit balance may not be actively ear -
marked for use in future budgets.16
By changing the act implementing the debt 
brake, it would be possible to use the credit 
balance on the control account to settle emer -
gency loans. A modification of this nature 
would not pose a threat to sound government 
finances, as there is ultimately no deviation 
from the debt path stipulated under the debt 
brake.
If the control account balance is used to settle 
emergency loans from the coronavirus crisis, 
repayment obligations will sink accordingly. As 
a result, the structural scope for borrowing will 
not fall as far below the actual standard limit. 
The current credit balance can offset a large 
part of the emergency loans from 2020. Based 
on the authorised repayment schedule (up -
dated in January 2022), the annual burden 
– currently estimated to be €3½ billion – would 
then fall to €1 billion.17
Moderately increase scope 
for new borrowing especially 
given low debt ratios
The European rules permit a structural general 
government deficit ratio of up to 0.5% when 
debt ratios are above 60%, rising to 1% when 
they are below the 60% mark. These deficit 
rules normally ensure that the debt ratio moves 
sufficiently rapidly towards 60% or remains 
under 60%. The debt brake is more restrictive 
in many respects, primarily because its borrow -
ing limit of 0.35% of GDP remains unchanged 
when the debt ratio is low. Unlike the Euro -
pean rules, moreover, the debt brake requires 
repayment schedules, particularly for debt in -
curred by invoking the escape clause. The 
scope for borrowing is then reduced by the size 
of the necessary repayments.Sound government finances will not be jeop -
ardised by basing the debt brake more closely 
on the numerical European rules. Particularly 
below the 60% limit for the debt ratio, the 
debt brake could undergo moderate adjust -
ments. Given a general government debt ratio 
of under 60%, the standard limit for central 
government could be raised to 1% of GDP .18 As 
long as the debt ratio is above the 60% mark, 
it could be increased slightly to 0.5% of GDP . 
These arrangements could include special pro -
tection for investment expenditure (see pp. 63 f.). 
With good reason, however, the bar for chan -
ging the standard limit is set higher than for 
the aforementioned measures: a broad cross-  
party consensus would be needed to pass the 
necessary amendment to the Basic Law. With 
this broad endorsement, the chances are good 
that the rules would have a strong binding ef -
fect in the future and that decision- makers 
would refrain from applying them too loosely.
At the same time, it would be important to en -
sure that the European rules for the structural 
general government deficit ratio are met across 
the board. Increasing the borrowing limit under 
the central government debt brake to the Euro -
pean target levels of 0.5% and 1% would, in 
principle, be compatible with this aim: state 
governments are not permitted to incur struc -
tural debt, the social security schemes are gen -
erally prohibited from borrowing and the local 
governments are subject to strict limits. None -
theless, structural deficits certainly can arise at Consider using

16 In addition to the control account, there is a general re -
serve which has been built up over the past few years and 
also amounts to €48 billion. Any surpluses available at year 
end have been added to this reserve. The remaining differ -
ences between structural net borrowing and the standard 
limit under the debt brake have then been credited to the 
control account. Unlike the credit balance on the control 
account, the general reserve may be allocated for use in fu -
ture budgets.
17 If premia from previous years are booked on an accruals 
basis, the credit balance on the control account is lower.
18 The debt ratio should have fallen back under the 60% 
mark in the previous year and should remain below it ac -
cording to the medium- term projections for Germany’s Sta -
bility Programme. The European fiscal compact permits a 
structural deficit of 1% of GDP when the general govern -
ment debt ratio is significantly below 60%. If the deficit 
and the debt ratio are kept reliably in check, however, this 
should not entail any substantial additional constraints.Deutsche Bundesbank

these government levels in individual years. In 
addition, the debt brake limits also display 
some methodological differences with the EU 
limits for structural deficits.19 This is true, not 
least, of the aforementioned extensive forma -
tion of reserves in special funds that fall outside 
the scope of the debt brake. Consequently, 
forward- looking general government budget 
surveillance will, in any case, become more im -
portant than before. In Germany, the Stability 
Council is responsible for this surveillance, with 
the support of an independent advisory 
board.20 These bodies should flag potential 
conflicts with the European rules at an early 
stage and take steps to ensure that plans are 
adjusted so as to fulfil them.
Capped golden rule: secure 
public assets within the 
framework of the standard 
limits
There are sometimes calls to loosen the debt 
brake, with the argument that it stands in the 
way of forward- looking expenditure – particu -
larly on investment. In the context of the Euro -
pean rules, the Bundesbank has discussed the 
introduction of a capped golden rule.21 This 
would shield investment expenditure up to the 
net investment limit from consolidation pres -
sures. Such spending could be protected in a 
similar way within the debt brake framework. 
This could be tied to the moderate loosening of 
the standard limits outlined above. The ar -
rangements should take account of the fact 
that, in Germany, it is primarily state and local 
governments that are responsible for govern -
ment fixed capital formation.
It would already be relatively straightforward 
within the current framework to create incen -
tives to maintain the capital stock. Specifically, 
one option would be to stipulate that central 
government (and possibly, along similar lines, 
the state governments) can only exhaust the 
standard limit if its (real) capital stock does not 
fall in net terms.22 If, however, write- downs are higher than investment (negative net invest -
ment), the scope for borrowing would fall ac -
cordingly.23 This would set an incentive to 
maintain the capital stock. Larger investments 
would be possible but would not increase the 
scope for borrowing.
A second option would be to set incentives to 
expand the capital stock. If the standard limit 
for central government is raised to 0.5% of 
GDP , this increase could be tied to net invest -
ment: if central government’s net investment is 
below 0.15% of GDP ,24 this would reduce the 
scope for borrowing accordingly. Given stable 
net assets, the structural borrowing limit would 
thus remain unchanged at 0.35% of GDP . An 
expansion of the capital stock could be funded 
with additional debt of up to 0.15% of GDP .
The rules applicable given a debt ratio below 
60% could thus be as follows: the standard 
limit could increase to 1% of GDP but a part of 
this would be tied to reaching a certain level of 
net investment.25 For example, the aim could 
be to use borrowing scope to secure general 
government net investment of 0.5% of GDP . It 
would not make sense for this scope to apply 
to central government investment alone. In -Investment can

22 In the following, the (real) capital stock is deemed to be 
stable if depreciation is offset by the acquisition of fixed 
assets.
23 Data on central government’s write- downs can be 
found in the national accounts. They remain relatively 
stable from year to year. Here, the plans would need to in -
clude corresponding estimates. Any deviations from the 
outturn could then be corrected in the subsequent fiscal 
year. Any asset sales would need to be deducted from ex -
penditure.
24 According to the national accounts figures for the last 
few years, the net investment of central government and 
its off- budget entities was around this size.
25 In the debate about reforming the European rules, the 
Bundesbank argued that, given debt ratios substantially 
below 60% and net investment amounting to 0.5% of 
GDP , deficit ratios of up to 1.5% were justifiable from a sta -
bility policy perspective. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019b, 
2021c). Given a corresponding European rule, this could 
also be taken into account within the debt brake frame -
work.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

stead, central government could be permitted 
to use its additional borrowing scope to fund 
state and local government net investment, 
too. For this purpose, central government 
could transfer to a state government the 
amount of funds used by this state and its local 
governments to acquire government non-  
financial assets.26 This would give state and 
local governments a strong incentive to at least 
maintain their capital stock with other funds: 
only then would they be able to access add -
itional central government funds for net invest -
ment.
It should be borne in mind that, from a general 
government perspective, it is not a lack of 
funds that has tended to stand in the way of 
greater investment in recent years. There were 
often substantial delays connected with plan -
ning, approval and the award of contracts. 
Measures to simplify or speed up these pro -
cesses would therefore seem particularly im -
portant, and several have already been an -
nounced by the Federal Government.
Emergency loans: repayment 
obligation to expire once 
moderate debt ratios 
achieved
At present, the Basic Law stipulates that emer -
gency loans must be tied to a repayment sched -
ule. This means that when the standard limits 
are exceeded in emergencies, this has to be 
offset in the years that follow. This effectively 
lowers structural borrowing limits – which 
counts as repayment. Such a repayment obliga -
tion could be eliminated once debt ratios are 
sufficiently moderate again. This criterion could 
be regarded as fulfilled when the debt ratio is 
back below the Maastricht requirement of 60% 
and is expected to remain so in the medium-  
term fiscal plan. This would imply that the 
shock to the budget had been overcome, and 
a sound structural position restored. In that 
case, it would no longer seem necessary to re -
strict borrowing beyond the general borrowing limit. New arrangements such as these would 
likewise require an amendment to the debt 
brake provisions in the Basic Law.27 Such con -
stitutional reforms to the debt brake would 
have to be backed by a broad consensus. The 
European rules would not preclude such a loos -
ening of the repayment rules. The debt ratio 
would be below the ceiling, and the European 
rules do not stipulate that infringements of the 
deficit limit should be offset by a more ambi -
tious stance in subsequent years.
Take EU deficits into account 
in debt brake in the future
The NextGenerationEU (NGEU) fund has led to 
the EU incurring more substantial deficits, and 
corresponding debt, for the first time: the EU is 
borrowing funds in order to make transfers to 
Member States.28 The loans taken out at the 
EU level for this purpose are to be repaid in the 
years from 2028 to 2058. From an economic 
point of view, the fiscal burdens caused by this 
EU debt are being shouldered by taxpayers in 
the Member States.29
At present, the debt brake does not take ac -
count of burdens on the central government 
budget arising from EU debt at the time when 
these obligations arise. This EU debt was not a 
topic of discussion when the debt brake was 
adopted, nor does the Treaty on European 
Union actually envisage more extensive EU def -
icits and debt. That is why NGEU was set up as 
a one- off programme. However, similar add -Prevent backlogs

26 Here, data from local government budgets using 
double- entry bookkeeping could provide a good basis. 
State governments could receive transfers in proportion to 
their population share.
27 Although looser repayment obligations for emergency 
loans could increase the incentive to declare an emergency, 
the relatively narrow definition of emergencies in the Basic 
Law would probably ensure that this effect is not too 
strong. However, specifying more detailed provisions re -
garding emergencies, including the purpose limitation of 
emergency loans, could be an option to consider.
28 In addition, assistance loans are granted to individual 
Member States as part of NGEU.

itional programmes, as well as permanent 
debt- financed EU facilities, are now under dis -
cussion. Consequently, it should be ensured 
that the aims of the debt brake are not under -
mined by EU deficits and debt. In future, the 
debt brake should therefore already take these 
into account at the time they arise – just like 
national deficits and debt. EU deficits would be 
counted proportionally towards central govern -
ment’s structural net borrowing. Germany’s 
financing share in the EU’s debt service is ap -
proximately the same as its share in the gross 
national income (GNI) of the EU; its GNI share 
could therefore be used as the basis for count -
ing EU deficits towards the debt brake. This would make the associated burden on Germa -
ny’s finances immediately visible. Current prac -
tice makes such burdens visible only when they 
are repaid and not when they arise, which 
seems to be incompatible with the intention of 
the debt brake.30 If debt brake requirements 
are to be tied to the debt ratio, EU debt (includ -
ing for assistance loans) should also be taken 
into account proportionally in these arrange -
ments.

Demand for euro banknotes issued  
by the Bundesbank: current developments
The volume of euro banknotes in circulation issued by the Bundesbank has continued to grow 
strongly over the past few years and amounted to €884 billion at the end of 2021. While the add -
itional demand for banknotes issued by the Bundesbank predominantly originated from abroad 
up to 2014, domestic demand has since been the key determinant.
At the end of 2019, immediately prior to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the cumulated 
net issuance of euro banknotes by the Bundesbank came to €750 billion. According to estimates, 
this figure comprised domestic demand totalling €305 billion and foreign demand in the amount 
of €445 billion. An estimated €245 billion of the domestic demand was accounted for by hold -
ings held as a store of value and €60 billion by transaction balances used for purchasing goods 
and services. However, the importance of the transaction motive is considerably greater than 
these figures suggest, as transaction balances are used in multiple transactions within a year and 
therefore finance a much greater volume of cash spending.
Demand for banknotes grew strongly during the coronavirus crisis. While the Bundesbank’s net 
issuance of euro banknotes amounted to €59 billion in 2019, this figure was €71 billion in 2020 
and still came to €63 billion in 2021. Since foreign demand was weak during the coronavirus pan -
demic owing to travel restrictions, the above- average rise in banknotes in circulation over the 
past two years was driven almost exclusively by domestic demand for banknotes as a store of 
value, the volume of which increased to €370 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. As in previous 
crises, people placed their trust in cash during the coronavirus crisis, too. The increased demand 
for banknotes was met successfully without any difficulties as the cash supply was assured at all 
times.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Euro banknotes are used as a means of pay -
ment and store of value. The European Central 
Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of 
the Eurosystem are collectively responsible for 
the issuance of euro banknotes. In Germany, it 
is the Bundesbank’s task to ensure the desired 
volume of euro cash is in circulation and that 
it is of high quality. This article examines the 
current  demand for banknotes issued by the 
Bundes bank and discusses, in particular, the 
impact of the coronavirus crisis on German-  
issued banknotes in circulation – i.e. the cumu -
lated net issuance of euro banknotes by the 
Bundesbank – in 2020 and 2021.1 Observed 
develop ments will be analysed in this article, 
amongst other things, using a breakdown of 
banknote demand into the following compon -
ents – foreign demand, domestic store of value 
and domestic transaction balance – as well as 
using a structural time series model for the cir -
culation of €50 banknotes in Germany.Demand for euro banknotes 
issued by the Bundesbank 
until the onset of the 
coronavirus pandemic
Developments in the volume of euro banknotes 
in circulation over roughly the first 15 years are 
well documented in earlier articles.2 This sec -
tion aims to continue to describe these devel -
opments up until the end of 2019. At the end 
of January 2002, shortly after euro cash had 
been introduced, euro banknotes in circulation 
issued by the Eurosystem totalled €221 billion. 
By the end of December 2019, i.e. the last year- 
end figure before the pandemic, the volume of 
euro banknotes in circulation had grown to a 
total of roughly €1,293 billion (see the adjacent 
chart).3 The cumulated net issuance of euro 
banknotes by the Bundesbank increased at a 
particularly rapid pace compared with total 
euro banknotes in circulation, growing from 
€73 billion to around €750 billion from the 
introduction of euro cash to the end of Decem -
ber 2019. The chart shows that, given other -
wise similar developments, the growth rate of 
German- issued euro banknotes in circulation 
was usually above the corresponding growth 
rate for the Eurosystem. This growth differen -
tial is explained by the traditionally high foreign 
demand for euro banknotes issued by the Bun -
desbank.Article investi -

1 The cumulated net issuance of euro banknotes by the 
Bundesbank corresponds to the arithmetical volume of 
banknotes in circulation, i.e. the sum of cash withdrawals 
from the Bundesbank less the sum of lodged banknotes. 
Euro banknotes issued by the Bundesbank are referred to 
below as German- issued euro banknotes. It should be 
noted in this context that these euro banknotes are not ne -
cessarily located in Germany and that a considerable part 
of them are, in fact, abroad.

beginning of 2002 to the end of 2009, see Deutsche

3 This article focuses on developments in the volume of 
euro banknotes in circulation. At the end of December 
2019, a total of 135.1 billion euro coins with a value of 
€30.0 billion were in circulation, of which – in arithmetical 
terms – 39.9 billion euro coins with a value of €9.1 billion 
had been issued by the Bundesbank. As the volume of euro 
coins in circulation is small in terms of value, growth in euro 
banknotes in circulation is also informative with regard to 
developments in the value of the demand for euro cash.Deutsche Bundesbank

As shown in the upper adjacent chart, it is esti -
mated that, in terms of value, roughly 60% of 
German- issued euro banknotes in circulation 
were located abroad at the end of 2019: 40% 
outside the euro area and 20% elsewhere in 
the euro area. Thus, the estimated foreign de -
mand totalled €445 billion at the end of 2019, 
€145 billion of which was accounted for by 
other euro area Member States and €300 bil -
lion by the rest of the world. Although the 
share of foreign demand for euro banknotes 
rose from 25% to roughly 70% between the 
end of 2004 and the end of 2013, it has been 
diminishing since then. Correspondingly, the 
share of domestic demand for German- issued 
euro banknotes in circulation has risen steadily 
from just under 30% at the end of 2013 to just 
over 40% at the end of 2019. This is due to the 
strong increase in the (estimated) domestic bal -
ances held as a store of value in this period (see 
the lower adjacent chart). The low opportunity 
costs of holding cash owing to persistently low 
interest rates are likely to have played a key role 
here.4 For instance, the three- month EURIBOR 
rate declined from 0.33% in May 2014 to 
-0.01% in May 2015 and fell further to -0.4% 
by the end of 2019. The estimated transaction 
balance rose from around €50 billion to €60 
billion from the end of 2013 to the end of 
2019; however, its share in the volume of bank -
notes in circulation decreased from 11% to 8%.
Developments in euro bank -
notes in circulation during 
the coronavirus pandemic
The easiest way to show the impact of the out -
break of the pandemic in early 2020 on German-  
issued banknotes in circulation is by comparing 
net banknote issuance in the crisis years of 2020 
and 2021 with that of 2019 – the last year before 
the onset of the crisis. We will subsequently also 
examine the lodgements of banknotes with and The share of

withdrawals of banknotes from the Bundesbank, 
from which net issuance is derived. This compari -
son is even more meaningful as it distinguishes in 
each case between small- denomination bank -
notes (€5, €10 and €20 banknotes), the medium-  
denomination banknote (€50 banknote) and 
large- denomination banknotes (€100, €200 
and €500 banknotes5). The denomination size 
sheds light on the use of banknotes. Small-  
denomination banknotes are typically used for 
transaction purposes and large- denomination 
banknotes as a store of value.6 Demand for €50 
banknotes stems from both of these motives. 
Net issuance in 2019, 2020 and 2021 is shown in 
the upper panel of the chart above.Net issuance grew comparatively strongly in 
2020, with the net issuance of €21 billion in

5 At the start of May 2016, the ECB Governing Council de -
cided that the production and issuance of the €500 bank -
note would be discontinued around the end of 2018. The 
Bundesbank stopped issuing these banknotes on 26 April 
2019. As a result of lodgements of this denomination with 
the central bank since then, the circulation of German-  
issued €500 banknotes dropped from €173.8 billion at the 
end of April 2019 to €141.1 billion at the end of December 
2021.

pensed by ATMs and not only distributed over the counter.Deutsche Bundesbank

in that month also rose significantly. As an ex -
planation for this, it stands to reason that con -
sumers and professional cash handlers built up 
considerable cash holdings for precautionary 
reasons at the start of the first lockdown in 
March 2020.7 For instance, at €48.1 billion, 
credit institutions’ cash holdings were around 
30% higher in March 2020 than in the previous 
year. Concerns regarding potential logistical re -
strictions on the supply of cash during lockdown 
were probably behind this precautionary motive. 
Precautionary savings became less important 
after it became apparent that the cash cycle 
worked during the pandemic, too. As the year 
progressed, developments were driven by cash 
holdings used as a store of value due to the lack 
of spending opportunities and supply difficulties 
as a result of the pandemic. By contrast, as from 
April 2020, the month in which the reduction of 
precautionary cash holdings began, net issuance 
of small denominations was below the previous 
year’s figure. Looking at 2020 as a whole, net is -
suance of small- denomination banknotes was 
around 64% lower than the level seen in the 
previous year. This was due to the significant de -
cline in the use of cash at the point of sale as a 
result of limited opportunities to spend cash – in 
retail, restaurants and at fairs, for example  – 
owing to the pandemic. Nevertheless, almost 
60% of everyday purchases were still made 
using cash in 2020.8
At €71 billion, the rise in banknotes in circula -
tion in 2020 – the first year of the coronavirus 
pandemic – was around 21% higher than the 
figure for 2019 on balance. The increase in 
banknotes in circulation in 2021 –  totalling 
around €63 billion – was weaker than in the 
previous year given weak growth in the net issu -
ance of €50 banknotes, but was still just under 
7% greater than the increase posted in 2019. 
Growth in the volume of small- denomination 
banknotes was also weak in 2021. The second 
lockdown between November 2020 and May 
2021 is likely to have left its mark here.
Further insights are gained by looking at the 
withdrawals and lodgements of banknotes that underlie net issuance, as shown in the chart on 
p. 70 (middle and lower panels). First, it is no -
ticeable that both withdrawals and lodgements 
were significantly lower in 2020 and 2021 than 
the prior- year figures.9 This means that there 
was a contraction in the banknote cycle during 
the pandemic, owing to the considerable de -
cline in cash spending by consumers as a result 
of the economic downturn.10 This contraction 
can predominantly be seen in small denomin -
ations and the €50 banknote. This also points 
to a decline in the demand for banknotes for 
transaction purposes during the pandemic.
The sharp rise in net issuance in March 2020 
was accompanied by a steep increase in with -
drawals of large- denomination banknotes. 
During the two pandemic years of 2020 and 
2021, withdrawals of large denominations ex -
ceeded the figures for 2019, whereas the cor -
responding figures for lodgements fell short. 
This suggests a rise in the demand for bank -
notes as a store of value during the pandemic.

7 The first lockdown in response to the coronavirus crisis 
was between March and May 2020 and the second lock -
down lasted from November 2020 to May 2021. From Sep -
tember 2021, varying degrees of restrictions on public life 
linked to vaccination status (known in Germany as the 
“3G”, “2G” and”2G- Plus” rules) were in effect.
8 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021a).
9 At around €58 billion, the decline in lodgements in 2020 
was sharper than the decrease in withdrawals (around €46 
billion). As a result, the rise in banknotes in circulation in 
2020 was around €12 billion higher than that of 2019, as 
mentioned above.
10 The banknote cycle maps out the banknote payment 
flows between the Bundesbank, credit institutions, con -
sumers and retailers. The Bundesbank issues banknotes to 
the banking system via its branches, which, in turn, makes 
the banknotes available to customers for withdrawal over 
the counter (OTC) or from ATMs. The banknotes are used 
by consumers for their cash spending at retailers (and else -
where), and are then deposited at the Bundesbank’s 
branches by retailers, either directly or via the commercial 
banks. The banknote cycle primarily reflects the active cir -
culation of banknotes, i.e. the banknotes used to make 
payments at the point of sale. For further information on 
this topic, see the box on pp. 75ff.Deutsche Bundesbank

of German- issued banknotes is broken down 
into its components below. Foreign demand is 
looked at with its sub- components “non- euro 
area foreign demand” and “euro area foreign 
demand”, as is domestic demand with its sub- 
components “domestic transaction balance” 
and “domestic store of value”. The estimated 
regional distribution can be seen in the upper 
chart on p. 69 and its year- on- year change is 
shown in the upper chart above. In 2020, the 
first year of the pandemic, the volume of 
German- issued euro banknotes in circulation 
rose more sharply than ever before, at around 
€71 billion, excluding the period in which euro 
cash was introduced in 2002. This was solely due to the extraordinarily sharp rise in the do -
mestic demand for banknotes. The contribu -
tion of foreign demand was still positive, yet 
stood at a historically low level. To explain 
these developments, foreign demand and do -
mestic demand are broken down into their 
components in even more granular fashion.
The estimated foreign demand consists of (net) 
deliveries of euro banknotes to non- euro area 
countries by international banknote wholesale 
traders (net shipments) and the direct net ex -
ports of euro banknotes via the travel sector.11 
As shown in the lower adjacent chart, foreign 
demand rose only slightly in 2020. At €6 billion, 
this increase was considerably lower than in 
previous years. While net outflows resulting 
from travellers taking banknotes between Ger -
many and other countries were significantly 
weaker than in 2019 (albeit still positive), net 
shipments were even slightly negative in 2020. 
In 2021, net shipments fell by a considerable €7 
billion; the slight rise in net outflows of bank -
notes from travel was unable to offset this de -
crease. Total foreign demand thus grew even 
more slowly in 2021 than in the preceding year. 
Overall, the growth in foreign demand deceler -
ated significantly during the coronavirus pan -
demic. The reason for this is likely to be the de -
cline in travel caused by the coronavirus pan -
demic, with travellers exporting fewer bank -
notes from Germany and demand in 
international banknote wholesale trading fall -
ing as well.12Substantial rise

net exports of euro banknotes via the travel sector are re -
corded regularly by the Bundesbank when it compiles the 
balance of payments statistics.
12 Travel is a substantial reason behind demand in inter -
national banknote wholesale trade as the latter supplies, 
inter alia, bureaux de change with banknotes for use in 
tourism. In periods of economic uncertainty abroad, the 
motive to use cash as a store of value also plays a key role, 
as seen, for example, when net shipments rose sharply dur -
ing the escalation of the financial crisis in the fourth quar -
ter of 2008.Deutsche Bundesbank

The domestic demand for banknotes consists of 
the transaction balances for the purposes of 
consumer spending13 and the balances held as a 
store of value.14 The estimates of both of these 
components are shown in the lower chart on 
p. 69 and their year- on- year change is depicted 
in the adjacent chart. They illustrate that the 
strong domestic demand for banknotes since 
the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has 
been almost  exclusively due to the store-of-value 
motive . Standing at approximately €70 billion, 
domestic store of value grew as strongly in 2020 
as in the two preceding years combined. This is 
by far the biggest increase since the introduc -
tion of euro cash.15 Domestic store of value like -
wise increased substantially in 2021, the second 
year of the pandemic, albeit not to the same ex -
tent as in 2020. This sharp rise in the store of 
value was due mainly to the restrictions on op -
portunities for spending on account of the 
measures adopted to contain the pandemic. 
This led to the household saving rate experien -
cing an exceptionally strong rise from 10.8% in 
2019 to 16.1% in 2020 and remaining at a high 
level in 2021 as well, at 15.0%.16 It is also likely 
that the persistent low interest rate environment 
has continued to play a role.17
After the estimated domestic transaction bal -
ances had risen prior to the coronavirus crisis 
from just over €40 billion at the end of 2002 to 
€60 billion at the end of 2019, they are esti -
mated to have fallen by around €3 billion in 
2020. This decline followed directly on from 
the slump in private consumption expenditure. 
As this recovered in 2021, transaction balances 
contributed positively to the growth in domes -
tic demand once more, as was typical before 
the pandemic.
On the whole, the trend outlined at the begin -
ning of this article of the growing importance 
of domestic store of value for the dynamics of 
banknote circulation has been amplified during 
the pandemic. As shown in the table on p. 74, 
cash held as a store of value now makes up a 
share estimated to be just over 40% of the 
Bundesbank’s total cumulated net issuance. Sharp increase

Domestic transaction balance
13 The estimation of the transaction balances is based on 
the estimated starting balance at the beginning of 2002 
derived from the growth of D- Mark and euro banknotes in 
Germany during the introduction of euro cash. This starting 
balance was then extrapolated using the growth rate of 
nominal private consumption expenditure; see Bartzsch et 
al. (2011b), Section 2.2.6.
14 Domestic store of value is determined by deducting the 
estimated foreign demand and the estimated domestic 
transaction balance from the total number of banknotes 
in circulation. For simplicity, this residual is referred to here 
as domestic store of value rather than domestic non-  
transaction balances. It comprises all banknote stocks that 
have not been destined for transactions or cash spending. 
Besides the stocks held as a store of value, this also in -
cludes precautionary cash holdings, cash held by banks to 
avoid negative interest rates and lost banknotes. Precau -
tionary cash holdings are used as provisions for unforeseen 
opportunities for spending and unforeseen bottlenecks in 
the availability of cash.
15 Domestic store of value stood on average at around 
€70 billion in the period from 2003 to 2013, peaking at 
€80 billion. This long period of sideways movement was 
followed by a phase of strong growth starting in 2014 and 
lasting up to the present day. In the period from the start 
of 2014 until the end of 2019, store of value increased 
from just under €80 billion to around €245 billion. Average 
annual growth stood at €28 billion over this period.
16 The household saving rate is defined in the financial ac -
counts as disposable income not used for consumption 
over total disposable income. Changes in households’ cash 
holdings are part of their acquisition of financial assets or 
savings and thus influence their saving rate. According to 
financial accounts data, the share of cash in households’ 
total acquisition of financial assets in 2020 (amounting to 
€388 billion) was 15.7%. In the same year, households’ 
financial assets stood at €6,950 billion and the share of 
cash in these assets was 4.7%. See Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2021b).
17 There is evidence of a statistically significant, negative 
relationship between domestic banknote demand in Ger -
many and the generally prevailing interest rate level. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2019), Section 4.3.5.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2022  
73

Total domestic demand makes up just under 
50%. The box on pp. 75ff. shows that domes -
tic transaction balances are turned over mul -
tiple times within a year and therefore finance 
a substantially higher volume of cash consump -
tion. The importance of domestic transaction 
balances is thus considerably greater than their 
small share of just 7% in banknote circulation 
would suggest. Around 50% of banknotes in 
circulation are abroad, the majority outside the 
euro area.
Time series analyses using 
the circulation of €50 
banknotes  as an example
In addition to breaking it down into compon -
ents, banknote circulation can also be studied 
using methods for time series analysis. These 
allow the determinants of banknote circulation 
to be identified and for banknote circulation to 
be projected as well. This is demonstrated 
below using an example of what is known as a 
structural time series model, which was de -
veloped to project the number of €50 bank -
notes in circulation issued by the Bundesbank 
for banknote requirement planning purposes.18 
This banknote denomination is particularly suit -
able for observation as it is sought after for 
both transaction and store- of- value purposes. As shown below, it is therefore influenced by a 
large number of explanatory variables. Struc -
tural time series models break down a time ser -
ies into its unobservable statistical components 
such as trend and season. As in regression 
models, explanatory variables can also be in -
corporated. The model set up for the circula -
tion of €50 banknotes is outlined in the box on 
pp. 78 f. The result of the maximum likelihood 
estimation for the estimation period from Janu -
ary 2002 to September 2020 is summarised in 
the table on p. 79.
The outcome of the estimation is satisfactory. 
Most effects are highly significant and the 
model is able to explain 74% of the variation in 
the circulation of the €50 banknote. The re -
siduals are homoscedastic and normally distrib -
uted; some higher lags, however, exhibit serial 
correlation. The estimations are shown in the 
chart on p. 80. In the uppermost subchart, the 
actual circulation of the €50 banknote is com -
pared to the estimated sum of trend, regres -
sion effect and intervention effects. The trajec -
tory of the time series is well- replicated. The 
seasonal peaks in December are captured by 
the seasonal effects shown separately in the 
fourth subchart from the top. A deterministic 
seasonal pattern was identified, meaning that 
the seasonal pattern is the same every year. 
The seasonal high in December is explained by 
Christmas shopping, which leads to additional 
demand for €50 banknotes in December 
amounting to an estimated 62 million notes. 
The remaining deviations between the actual 
circulation of the €50 banknote and that esti -
mated by the model are shown in the irregular 
component in the lowermost subchart. The re -
gression effect in the fifth subchart from the 
top represents the calendar effect of the Easter 
holidays. In most years, these fall in the same 
month, which is reflected in sharp fluctuations Structural time

Domestic transaction balances of banknotes 
and cash  consumption
According to the estimates outlined here, 
the majority of the demand for banknotes 
issued  by the Bundesbank is attributable to 
the high domestic demand for banknotes for 
use as a store of value as well as the strong 
foreign demand. In absolute terms, domestic 
transaction balances had also been trending 
upwards before the outbreak of the corona-
virus crisis, growing from just over €40 bil-
lion at the end of 2002 to €60 billion at the 
end of 2019. Despite this rise – which was 
temporarily interrupted in 2020 during the 
coronavirus pandemic – only 7% of German- 
issued banknotes in circulation at the end of 
2021 were held domestically for transaction 
purposes, i.e. for paying for goods and ser-
vices. This low share may seem surprising at 
fi  rst glance. However, it is explained by the 
fact that transaction balances are frequently 
turned over and thus relatively small bal-
ances are suffi   cient for funding cash expend-
iture for goods and services (cash consump-
tion). Cash consumption is therefore the 
appro priate measure for determining the 
signifi   cance of the transaction motive. The 
relationship between transaction balances as 
a measure of cash holdings and cash con-
sumption as a measure of cash fl  ows is de-
scribed by the following quantity equation:
Domestic transaction balances * velocity of 
circulation = household cash consumption.1
Domestic transaction balances are estimated 
as part of the decomposition of German- 
issued banknotes in circulation. They consist 
mainly of the transaction balances of house-
holds and the cash balances of credit institu-
tions.2 Credit institutions hold cash primarily 
to supply it to their customers, i.e. in a way, 
they represent external transaction balances 
of consumers.3 Nevertheless, the sharp rise 
in credit institutions’ cash holdings that began in 2016 is attributable to the fact that 
they have, in part, shifted liquid assets away 
from the deposit facility, which is remuner-
ated at a negative interest rate, and towards 
banknotes. This is therefore a special mon-
etary policy effect.
Households’ cash consumption, i.e. con-
sumer cash expenditure for goods and ser-
vices, is a key metric of the cash cycle.4 It is 
estimated by deducting the following items 
from households’ domestic consumption 
expenditure:
– regular payments, such as for housing or 
electricity;
– card payments at the point of sale, ex-
cluding credit card payments in online 
trade;
– expenditure in traditional mail order and 
online trade.5
1 The quantity equation (also transaction equation) 
provides information about the relationship between 
money and goods transactions within an economy. It 
is based on the assumption that all transactions are 
settled using a determinable money supply (in the 
form of coins, banknotes or book money). The quan-
tity equation is defi  ned as follows: M * v = P * T, or 
money supply * velocity of circulation = price level * 
transactions. The velocity of money circulation v  de-
notes how frequently the money supply M is used to 
make payments within a given period.
2 See Bartzsch and Uhl (2017), Section 3.2. The esti-
mated cash holdings of trade are thus negligibly small.

sumption expenditure in Germany are adjusted for 
regular payments based on our own estimations. The 
data on card payments at the point of sale are taken 
from the payment card statistics of PaySys Consultancy

The corresponding time series are depicted 
in the chart above.6 Until 2019, estimated 
cash expenditure remained quite stable at 
around €440 billion, despite the increasing 
prevalence of card payments. The declining 
proportion of cash payments at the point of 
sale was thus compensated by rising 
consumption . In 2020, cash expenditure 
dropped sharply. The changes in the time 
series are shown in the lower part of the 
same chart. They show that, in 2020, ad-
justed household fi  nal consumption ex-
penditure in Germany fell exceptionally 
sharply by just over €80 billion over the 
course of the pandemic- related economic downturn. Households’ cash expenditure 
fell by an even larger amount, dropping by 
just over €90 billion. This difference is due 
to the increased use of card payments at 
the point of sale. This means that, during 
the pandemic, payment behaviour has 
changed away from cash.7 In this context, 
consumers’ hygiene concerns regarding the 
spread of the coronavirus also played a 
role.8 By contrast, expenditure in online 
trade remained almost unchanged. This can 
be explained by opposite, counterbalancing 
developments in the trade of goods and 
services.9
According to the quantity equation de-
scribed above, the ratio between cash con-
sumption and domestic transaction bal-
ances corresponds to the circulation vel-
ocity of domestic transaction balances, 
which is depicted in the chart on p. 77. It has 
been experiencing a downward trend for a 
number of years, which has been reinforced 
further by the pandemic. In 2020, transac-
tion balances saw a return frequency of 
only just over six. This phenomenon can 
also be described using the average rest or 
cash holding periods.10 These are defi  ned as 
the inverse of the circulation velocity and 
represent the average amount of time that 
the cash spends in holding. The average 
6 The data required to estimate cash expenditure in 
2021 are not yet available.
7 This is also confi  rmed by survey data on payments in 
stationary retail trade from the EHI Retail Institute. Ac-
cording to these data, the share of cash turnover fell 
from 46.5% in 2019 to 40.9% in 2020; see EHI (2020) 
and EHI (2021).
8 The risk of spreading the coronavirus via banknotes 
and coins is very low, however. This has been con-
fi  rmed by corresponding analyses conducted by the 
ECB; see Tamele et al. (2021).
9 See Bundesverband E- Commerce und Versandhan-
del e. V. (bevh) (2021). While sales of goods rose 
sharply from €72.6 billion to €83.3 billion (+14.6%), 
sales of services fell by roughly the same amount from 
€19.6 billion to €9.2 billion (-52.8%).
10 This is based on the Cambridge equation, which is 
derived directly from the quantity equation: M = k * 
P * T, or money supply = average cash rest period * 
price level * transactions, where k = 1/v.Households' cash expenditure and its

in these months. In 2002, 2013 and 2018, parts 
of the long Easter weekend fell in both March 
and April, which is reflected in flatter peaks. 
According to the table, the size of the regres -
sion effect stands at around 13, meaning that, 
in the Easter months, the volume of €50 bank -
notes in circulation is 13 million notes higher 
than usual. This calendar effect is thus consid -
erably smaller than the seasonal effect at 
Christmas. The largest component of the time 
series under consideration is its rising trend, the 
(local) level of which is shown in the second 
subchart from the top. This amounted to 4,600 
million notes at the end of the estimation 
period in September 2020, with the total vol -
ume of €50 banknotes in circulation standing 
at 4,750 million notes. The (local) slope of the 
trend, i.e. the trend growth, is shown in the 
third subchart from the top and represents the 
direction of the trend. It exhibits exclusively 
positive values, which is reflected in the in -
crease in the trend. Since September 2010, the slope has tended to grow, which is reflected in 
the non- linear, ever steeper trend path.
While the underlying development in €50 
banknotes in circulation is described using 
trend and season as unobservable compon -
ents, the intervention variables capture special 
factors. The total (cumulated) effects of the 
intervention variables on the circulation of the 
€50 banknote are indicated in the second- to- 
last subchart from the top. The peaks shown 
reflect the estimated effects of outliers. These 
have an impact on banknote circulation only in 
the month in which they occur. In contrast to 
these temporary influences, the structural 
breaks, modelled via the intervention variables, 
exert a lasting influence on banknote circula -
tion. For instance, the volume of €50 bank -
notes in circulation rose permanently in March 
2002, shortly after the introduction of euro 
cash, by an estimated 29 million notes. This 
level shift was due to the replenishment of 
holdings used as a store of value following the Various trend 
breaks in 
German- issued 
€50 banknotes 
in circulation, 
especially owing 
to crisesduration of cash holding periods rose from 
1.3 months in 2009 to 1.6 months in 2019. 
In 2020, it jumped to 1.9 months. One rea-
son that households held cash for longer is 
that, due to the pandemic, consumers with-
drew cash over the counter and from ATMs 
less frequently but in larger amounts.11 
However, at €510 billion, the total value of 
over- the- counter and ATM withdrawals in 
2020 was €73 billion lower than its value 
from 2019 as a result of the decline in cash 
consumption.12
11 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021c), tables 6b and 
7b.
12 This decline is largely explained by the sharp drop in 
cash consumption of around €90 billion described 
above. In addition, net exports of banknotes in the 
context of travel in 2020 were €10 billion below their 
value from the preceding year. This €100 billion de-
cline in demand for banknotes was only partially com-
pensated by the higher domestic demand for bank-
notes for use as a store of value (around €70 billion in 
2020 compared with around €35 billion in 2019).Circulation velocity of domestic

Structural time series model for €50 banknotes
in circulation
We identify, as the structural time series 
model for €50 banknotes in circulation, a 
model augmented by a deterministic sea-
sonal component with a local linear trend:
[1a]
yt=µt+γt+"t, "t⇠NID(0 ,σ2
"),t =1, ..., n,
[2a]
µt=µt1+⌫t1+⌘t,⌘t⇠NID(0 ,σ2
⌘),t =1, ..., n,
[2b]
⌫t=⌫t1+⇣t, ⇣t⇠NID(0 ,σ2
⇣),t =1, ..., n,
where yt denotes the observable time series 
of €50 banknotes in circulation, μt the 
trend, 𝜸t the seasonal component and εt 
the irregular component. μt–1 is the local 
stochastic level and vt–1 the local stochastic 
slope of the trend μt. vt follows a random 
walk and εt , ηt and ζt are mutually uncor-
related, independent and normally distrib-
uted disturbances with variances 2
", 2
⌘ and 
2
⇣. The deterministic seasonal component 
𝜸t follows the trigonometric seasonal form. 
Equation [1a] is the observation equation. 
Equations [2a] and [2b] are referred to as 
state equations and the whole model as a 
state- space model.
Additional “intervention variables” are 
added to the model in order to explain the 
time series. These variables represent spe-
cial events which lead to outliers1 and trend 
breaks.2 Additionally, the calendar effect of 
the Easter holidays is modelled by means of 
a regression variable.3 To do this, observa-
tion equation [1a] is augmented as follows:
[1b]
yt=µt+γt+βxt+hX
j=1λj!j,t+"t,"t⇠NID(0 ,2
"),t =1, ..., n,
where xt denotes the dummy variable for 
the Easter holidays and 𝜔j,t represents the 
j th intervention variable. The intervention 
variables in equation [1b] comprise outliers 
and trend breaks in the local level. In the 
former case, these are impulse dummies and, in the latter, step dummies. In order to 
also incorporate a trend break in the local 
slope, state equation [2b] is augmented ac-
cordingly:
[2c]
⌫t=⌫t1+˜λ˜!t+⇣t,⇣t⇠NID(0 ,σ2
⇣),t =1 , ..., n,
where 𝜔˜t is an impulse dummy variable. It 
takes on the value of one in the period in 
which the underlying event occurs and zero 
otherwise. The fi  nal structural time series 
model for (the number of) €50 banknotes 
in circulation thus consists of the observa-
tion equation [1b], the two state equations 
[2a] and [2c] and the state equations for the 
deterministic seasonal component, not 
shown here.
In order to estimate the model, the log- 
likelihood function is maximised regarding 
the unknown parameters, especially the 
variances 2
", 2
⌘ and 2
⇣. To do this, we 
apply the Kalman fi  lter to calculate and 
minimise the forecast errors of the one- step 
forecasts of the observable time series and 
its variances.4
1 An outlier is an unusually high value of the irregular 
component at a given point in time.
2 In a fi  rst step, the times at which potential interven-
tion variables occur (e.g. October 2008) are identifi  ed 
using exceptionally high values of the residuals. In a 
second step, the identifi  ed potential intervention vari-
ables are interpreted as exceptional events (e.g. fi  nan-
cial crisis).
3 The structural time series model presented here is a 
tool to create projections. We have therefore opted 
not to incorporate regression variables which model 
demand motives. For example, the transaction motive 
could be modelled by cash consumption and non- euro 
area foreign demand by the exchange rate. In section 
4.3 of Deutsche Bundesbank (2019), such econometric 
models are estimated as ARDL models for the demand 
for small, medium- sized and large denominations as 
well as for the domestic demand for euro banknotes 
issued by the Bundesbank.
4 These forecast errors and their variances are also 
used to calculate the standardised forecast errors, 
based on which we examine whether the residuals of 
the state- space model are independent, homoscedas-
tic and normally distributed.Deutsche Bundesbank

cash changeover, which lasted until the end of 
2003.19 A further structural break occurred in 
October 2008 as a result of the escalation of 
the financial crisis, when demand for €50 bank -
notes saw a sustained rise of 45 million notes. 
In this period, liquid, secure assets for use as a 
store of value were sought after, which caused 
demand especially for large- denomination 
banknotes to grow steeply.20 The next struc -
tural break, which took place in July 2015, 
caused a permanent increase in the number of 
€50 banknotes in circulation of 22 million 
notes. This was due to restrictions on with -
drawals from ATMs in Greece, when the debt 
crisis there came to a head. At that time, the 
Greek government was deadlocked in heated 
negotiations with the European Commission, 
the rest of the euro area, the ECB and the Inter -
national Monetary Fund about a further bailout 
programme in return for reform measures. As a 
result, German tourists took more €50 bank -
notes with them on their travels to Greece.21 
This additional demand was transaction-  
related. The next structural break is in connec -
tion with the ECB Governing Council’s decision 
on 4 May 2016 to discontinue the production 
and issuance of the €500 banknote. This re -
sulted in declines in these banknotes and shifts 
to the next smaller denominations all the way 
to the €50 banknote,22 the circulation of which 
showed a sustained increase in June 2016 of 33 
million notes. As can be identified in the chart 
on p. 80, the cumulated effects of the struc -
tural breaks on the level of the trend amounted 
to an estimated 130 million notes until June 
2016.
In March 2020, at the beginning of the corona -
virus pandemic, there was a further trend break 
in the local level, which, at 71 million notes, 
was considerably stronger than the other struc -Estimation of a structural time

tural breaks. This was probably due to precau -
tionary motives or concerns regarding potential 
logistical restrictions on the supply of cash. The 
precautionary holdings of €50 banknotes built 
up in March 2020 were reduced again in the 
subsequent months. This development is re -
flected in the model by the negative trend 
break in the local slope in May 2020, which has 
caused the trend to decline by around 13 mil -
lion notes each month since. As the chart 
shows, the precautionary holdings of €50 
banknotes built up in March 2020 had almost 
completely receded by the end of the estima -
tion period in September 2020. A similar devel -
opment was observed for the other banknote 
denominations during the pandemic.23
The structural time series model was estimated 
using data up to and including September 
2020, and the circulation of €50 banknotes 
thereby projected over the period from Octo -
ber 2020 to September 2021. The outcome is 
shown together with the projection of the 
ARIMA model, which is traditionally used in 
banknote requirement planning, in the chart 
on p. 81.24 We see that the projection using 
the structural time series model replicates the 
actual circulation of €50 banknotes well, and 
performs better than the ARIMA model. This is 
also reflected in measures of projection per -
formance.25 At the end of the projection period

23 According to the structural time series models for the 
other denominations, there was a positive structural break 
in the level of the trend in March 2020. In April and May, a 
negative structural break in trend growth occurred, which 
resulted in the precautionary holdings of all denominations 
built up in March 2020 receding again by September 2020 
at the latest. This process took longer for the large denom -
inations than for the small banknotes, as it was obscured 
by the simultaneous build- up of cash reserves.
24 The ARIMA model used is an ARIMAX(1,1,0)(1,1,0)12. 
The exogenous regressors X comprise step dummies for 
the financial crisis in October 2008 and the discontinuation 
of the issuance of €500 banknotes in Germany in April 
2019. The effect of the coronavirus pandemic is modelled 
using impulse dummies for the months spanning the 
March 2020 to September 2020 period.
25 For instance, the root mean squared prediction error of 
the structural time series model, at 24.4, is significantly 
below that of the ARIMA model, at 67.8. The statistical in -
formative value of this comparison is, however, limited by 
the short projection period of just 12 months.Deutsche Bundesbank

€50 banknotes in circulation. This circulation is 
overestimated by both projection models, but 
significantly more so by the ARIMA model, 
with a projected 5,085 million notes, than by 
the structural time series model, with a pro -
jected 4,983 million notes.
Concluding remarks
The volume of Bundesbank- issued euro bank -
notes in circulation continued to grow strongly 
in the wake of the coronavirus crisis and 
amounted to €884 billion at the end of 2021. 
Since 2015, domestic demand as a store of 
value has been the most important driver of 
demand for German- issued banknotes, while 
the dynamics previously stemmed from foreign 
demand. This development was lent further im -
petus by the coronavirus pandemic. The 
stronger- than- average rise in banknotes in cir -
culation during this period was almost exclu -
sively due the build- up of holdings for use as a 
store of value in the form of large- denomination 
banknotes. Increased demand for banknotes is 
a typical phenomenon in times of crisis, where 
people prefer to rely on tried and tested con -
cepts and place their confidence in cash as 
default- free central bank money.26 At the be -
ginning of the coronavirus crisis in March 2020, 
this was likely to have been due to precaution -
ary motives with regard to potential logistical 
restrictions on the supply of cash in lockdown. 
However, it quickly became apparent that the 
cash cycle worked and that the supply of cash 
was guaranteed at all times. The precautionary 
motive of banknote demand was therefore 
eclipsed by the store- of- value motive as a result 
of a lack of spending opportunities.
The developments described here are a global 
phenomenon.27 In most other countries, the 
volume of banknotes in circulation grew 
strongly during the pandemic, although online trade gained market share and consumers in -
creasingly paid using cashless instruments in 
shops due to an – unfounded28 – fear that the 
virus could be transmitted via banknotes. The 
holdings built up in the first few months of the 
pandemic can be explained by precautionary 
considerations. The increases declined in the 
ensuing period, though banknote demand re -
mained at an elevated level internationally. The 
sharp rise in the volume of large- denomination 
banknotes in circulation indicates that this is a 
general increase in holdings used as a store of 
value, typical for crises. International develop -
ments thus also underscore the significance of 
cash as an indispensable anchor of confidence 
in times of crisis.Above- average

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

* Non-financial groups admitted to the Prime Standard segment of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange which publish IFRS consolidated financial statements on a quarterly or
half-yearly basis and make a noteworthy contribution to value added in Germany. Ex-
cluding groups engaged in real estate activities.  1 Earnings before interest, taxes, de-
preciation and amortisation.  2 Quantile data are based on the groups' unweighted re-
turn on sales.  3 Annual figures do not always match the sum of the two half-year fig-ures. See Quality report on consolidated financial statement statistics, p. 3.  4 Adjusted

reporting sample. See the explanatory notes in Statistical Series Seasonally adjusted
business statistics.  5 Including groups in agriculture and forestry.  6 From this point on-
wards: significant changes in IFRS standards, impairing comparability with previous pe-
riods.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland,
Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were
used.  2 Includes countries belonging to the group EER-19 and additionally Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico,
Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB suspends
the publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate againstRussian rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation
of nominal effective exchange rates, the euro foreign exchange reference rate of
March 1, 2022 is used for the Russian Federation from that date. For the calculation
of real effective exchange rates as of February 2022, the monthly average of the
February 2022 euro foreign exchange reference rate and the February 2022 consumer
price index are used for the Russian Federation.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.
4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from
2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from 2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including
Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from 2015 including Lithuania) as well as Canada,
Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States.  5 Euro area countries (current composition) and countries belonging to the
group EER-19.  6 Euro area countries (current composition) and countries belonging to
the group EER-42. As of March 2022, for the Russian Federation a monthly average
indicative rate is used. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the
Bank of Russia in conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange refer-
ence rate to the US dollar.
