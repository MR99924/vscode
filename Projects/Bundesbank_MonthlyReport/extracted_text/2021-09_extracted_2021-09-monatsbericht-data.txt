Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The recovery of the German economy, which 
began in spring, continued at a faster pace in 
the third quarter of 2021. Private consumption 
and service providers received a particularly 
strong boost, as the pandemic-  related restric -
tions were eased and no longer apply for the 
most part. According to the ifo Institute, the 
assessment of the current situation improved 
very significantly in trade and amongst other 
service providers. At the same time, the labour 
market saw the onset of a robust recovery. 
Supply- side constraints continued in industry 
and as a result the output level continued to 
lag considerably behind strong demand. Indus -
trial output rose again in July for the first time 
in four months, but this was probably mainly 
due to the timing of the summer holidays. 
Overall, economic output is likely to have 
climbed more steeply in the third quarter than 
in the spring, when a 1.6% rise on the first 
quarter was reported. However, due to the 
supply- side problems in industry, the summer 
months are unlikely to have yet brought a re -
turn to the pre- crisis level of the fourth quarter 
of 2019, after the second quarter had still fallen 
around 3¼% short of that mark.
Industry
In July 2021, German industrial output saw a 
distinct seasonally adjusted rise on the month 
(+1¼%). This year’s pattern of school holidays 
and plant shutdowns is likely to have played an 
important role in driving this first increase in 
four months. This holds true for the automo -
tive sector, in particular. According to data pro -
vided by the German Association of the Auto -
motive Industry (VDA), the number of manu -
factured motor vehicles declined strongly in 
August following an increase in July, and on an average of the two summer holiday months 
there was a significant decrease on the level of 
the second quarter. Industrial output in July 
was slightly higher than the second-  quarter 
level overall (+½%). Broken down by sector, the 
production of consumer goods was up sub -
stantially on the quarter. The manufacture of 
capital goods increased only slightly, mainly 
due to the significant fall in the production of 
motor vehicles. By contrast, manufacturers of 
machinery and equipment and of computer, 
electronic and optical products ramped up their 
production markedly. The production of inter -
mediate goods was down distinctly, however. 
Bottlenecks in the supply of intermediate prod -
ucts continued to impair the recovery in indus -
try considerably. According to surveys by the ifo 
Institute, 64% of manufacturing enterprises re -
ported production hold- ups due to material 
shortages in July. The percentage rose further 
in August.1
Industrial new orders in July 2021 saw a steep 
rise on the month after seasonal adjustment 
(+3½%). The already high level of the second 
quarter was exceeded considerably (+5¼%), 
but excluding large orders there was a slight 
shortfall (-¼%). Broken down by region, do -
mestic orders and, in particular, orders from 
non- euro area countries saw steep growth. By 
contrast, demand from the euro area was 
down strongly. Broken down by sector, the 
manufacturers of capital goods posted very ro -
bust order growth, driven in particular by other 
transport equipment. Mechanical engineering 
firms likewise recorded a strong increase in 
orders. Demand for motor vehicles was down 
significantly, however. New orders received by 
producers of consumer goods also went up 
steeply, with orders of pharmaceutical products 
considerably higher. Demand for intermediate 
goods eased slightly. Overall, demand for Ger -
man industrial products in July exceeded the Robust recovery

pre- crisis level of the fourth quarter of 2019 by 
a hefty 18%, whilst industrial output was still 
3½% below its pre- crisis level.
After seasonal adjustment, nominal industrial 
sales were significantly higher in July 2021. 
They were up by 2¾% compared with both the 
previous month and the average of the second 
quarter. In a regional breakdown, industrial 
sales saw a strong quarter- on- quarter rise in 
Germany and in particular in the euro area 
countries. Sales in non- euro area countries 
were only slightly higher. Broken down by sec -
tor, sales of consumer goods increased strongly 
and sales of pharmaceutical products posted 
particularly steep growth. Sales of capital 
goods and intermediate goods likewise went 
up significantly. After seasonal adjustment, 
nominal exports of goods continued to rise in 
July 2021, edging up slightly compared with 
the previous month (+½%) and markedly 
higher than the second quarter (+1½%). In real 
terms, they did not quite match the level of the 
previous quarter (-½%), with exports to non-  
euro area countries down and exports to the 
euro area rising slightly. Nominal imports of 
goods receded sharply in July compared with 
the previous month (-3½%), and were thus 
also significantly lower than the average of the 
second quarter (-2%). After price adjustment, 
the gap compared with the second quarter 
was even more pronounced (-6%) due to the 
sharp increase in import prices. Supply bottle -
necks may have contributed to the strong fall.
Construction
After adjustment for seasonal variations, out -
put in the construction sector increased dis -
tinctly in July 2021 when compared with the 
previous month (+1%). It was slightly lower 
than the average of the second quarter (-½%), 
however, with output in the finishing trades 
stagnating. Output in the main construction 
sector was down markedly, with a clear con -
traction in civil engineering and a slight decline 
in building construction. Material shortages Industrial sales

also weighed on the construction sector. Ac -
cording to surveys by the ifo Institute, 37% of 
enterprises in the main construction sector 
were affected in August, showing that short -
ages of materials continued to ease that month 
after having peaked in June. The reach of the 
order books, which was already relatively ex -
tensive on a long- term average, continued to 
expand, however. Equipment utilisation sank 
slightly in July and August, but was likewise up 
considerably on its long- term average.
Labour market
There has been an exceptionally robust recov -
ery in the labour market since June. The sea -
sonally adjusted number of persons in work 
went up by 100,000 in July, following a simi -
larly strong increase in June. In particular, jobs 
subject to social security contributions were 
filled in June. Bolstered by short- time work dur -
ing the crisis, the number of persons in this 
type of employment thus already exceeded its 
pre- crisis level. The number of persons working 
exclusively in low- paid part- time employment 
likewise rose significantly in June for the first 
time since the summer of last year. More jobs 
were cut here in the crisis, however, so that 
there are currently almost 10% fewer persons 
in this form of employment with only low so -
cial security than at the beginning of 2020. The 
already long- lasting decline in self- employment 
at least came to a halt in July. The results from 
surveys on the willingness on the part of enter -
prises and employment agencies to recruit new 
staff and the constant increase in job vacancies 
suggest that the very favourable labour market 
developments will continue over the next few 
months.
The proportion of employees subject to social 
security contributions in cyclical short- time 
work declined to below 5% in June, thus hit -
ting its lowest level since the beginning of the 
pandemic. The peak in the last quarter of 2020 
and the first quarter of 2021 saw almost one in 
ten employees in short- time work in February 2021. In June alone, the number of short- time 
workers was down by 30% on the previous 
month. The volume of labour lost through 
short- time work fell even more strongly, as the 
working hours of short- time workers rose again 
on average. The uptake of short- time work is 
likely to have declined further in the summer 
holiday months. The ifo Institute estimates that 
only 688,000 employees were still receiving 
short- time working benefits in August.
After seasonal adjustment, registered un -
employment dropped again steeply in August. 
With a decline of 53,000 persons compared 
with the previous month, the unemployment 
rate went down to 5.5%. The lion’s share of 
the decrease concerned unemployment 
covered by the statutory insurance scheme, 
which is more cyclically driven. At the same 
time, there was also a fall in the number of un -
employed persons receiving the basic welfare 
allowance. The IAB’s unemployment barom -
eter was still at its highest level recorded in July. 
The next three months could therefore see a 
further strong drop in unemployment.
Prices
Demand concerns coupled with the spread of 
the Delta variant dampened crude oil prices in 
August, with prices down by around 6% com -
pared with July. They were nonetheless still up 
by just under 60% on the year. Prices rose again 
markedly in the course of September, however. 
Concerns relating to the spread of the Delta 
variant held back demand but, on the other 
hand, temporary production stoppages in Mex -
ico and the United States propped up prices. As 
this report went to press, the price of a barrel of 
Brent crude oil stood at US$77. Crude oil fu -
tures were still trading at significant discounts, 
however. The discount on crude oil futures was 
US$3¾ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$6¾ for deliveries 12 months ahead.

level in July. Whilst energy price inflation was at Robust recovery

a level similar to previous months, prices ex -
cluding energy went up much more strongly. 
The monthly inflation rate was also higher at 
the industrial producer level, for which data are 
already available for August, with energy prices 
continuing to climb steeply and more sharply 
than other goods. Import prices and industrial 
producer prices recently outstripped prior-  year 
levels by 15% and 12%, respectively. Excluding 
energy, the rate of increase was around 9% 
and just over 8% respectively.
At 0.2%, the seasonally adjusted rise in con -
sumer prices in August, as measured by the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), 
was no longer quite as steep as in the previous 
months, in which it had stood at 0.6% and 
0.4% respectively. This was due to the fact that 
price increases for energy, food and non- energy 
industrial goods tailed off. In the case of the 
latter, this was owing to prices for clothing and 
shoes which normally fluctuate sharply. By con -
trast, the cost of other industrial goods in -
creased at a similar rate as previously. Prices for 
services continued to rise steeply as well. An -
nual headline HICP inflation climbed from 3.1% 
to 3.4% and, excluding energy and food, from 
1.8% to 2.1%. Much like in July, the base effect 
of the temporary VAT cut from the second half 
of 2020 drove prices upward;2 it was damp -
ened by a statistical effect, however. This effect 
is due to the coronavirus pandemic having led 
to fairly major adjustments to some HICP 
weights for 2021 in line with consumption 
habits of the previous year.3 The headline rate 
according to the national Consumer Price Index 
(CPI), where there was no change to the 
weightings, rose from 3.8% to 3.9%. The 
dampening one- off effect will weaken signifi -
cantly this month and next; it will turn slightly 
positive in November before being eliminated 
entirely in December. As things currently stand, 
rates of between 4% and 5% could be seen 
temporarily from September until the end of 
the year. Inflation is likely to ease markedly at 
the beginning of 2022 but will still persist at 
more than 2% up to the middle of the year.Public finances4
Statutory health 
insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
– comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund – posted a significant def -
icit of €2½ billion in the second quarter of 
2021.5 The deficit was €1 billion higher than it 
had been a year earlier, due to a sharp rise in 
the health insurance institutions’ expenditure. 
This spending had fallen in the second quarter 
of 2020 because of a lower utilisation of ser -
vices due to the pandemic.
The health fund posted a deficit of almost €1 
billion, which was just over €3 billion lower 
than in the second quarter of 2020. This im -
provement is attributable, among other things, 
to the fact that central government is now fully 
reimbursing the health fund’s pandemic- related 
special payments.6 In spring 2020, by contrast, 
central government only reimbursed payments 
for keeping hospital beds empty due to the 
pandemic. In addition, in the second quarter of 
2021, the fund received retroactive refunds 
from the first quarter of the year. However, the 
fund’s balance was reduced by the partial for -

4 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
5 In 2021, reserves totalling €8 billion will be redistributed 
among the health insurance institutions via the health fund 
(€2 billion per quarter). The associated payment flows be -
tween the health insurance institutions and the health fund 
do not influence the financial situation of the SHI scheme 
as a whole and its two constituent parts. The revenue and 
expenditure developments outlined below are therefore 
adjusted for these payment flows.
6 In the second quarter of 2021, the pandemic- related spe -
cial payments amounted to €5½ billion. They encom -
passed financial assistance for hospitals to compensate 
them for empty beds due to the pandemic (€2 billion) as 
well as spending on tests (€2 billion), protective masks, 
vaccinations (mainly the cost share accruing to vaccination 
centres) and bonuses for nursing staff in hospitals (€½ bil -
lion each).Deutsche Bundesbank

grant of €5 billion which it had received in full 
at the beginning of the year. The fund pays the 
money out to the health insurance institutions 
in equal instalments across the year. On the 
revenue side, contributions increased by 6½% 
compared with the same quarter of the previ -
ous year. Around two percentage points of this 
was attributable to the higher additional contri -
bution rates. Total revenue likewise rose by 
6½%. On the expenditure side, the pandemic- 
related special payments declined sharply. All in 
all, the health fund’s expenditure thus in -
creased by a mere 1½%.
Despite solid revenue growth of 3½% in total, 
the health insurance institutions recorded a 
deficit of almost €2 billion. A year earlier, they 
had posted a surplus of €2½ billion: their ex -
penditure had fallen because of a lower utilisa -
tion of services due to the pandemic. In the 
second quarter of 2021, expenditure rose 
steeply, by 11%. Compared with the second 
quarter of 2019, this amounts to 5% average 
annual growth. Spending on hospital treat -
ment, a particularly large expenditure item, re -
corded a strong increase of 15% (-8% a year 
earlier).7 After declining in the second quarter 
of 2020 (-7%), expenditure on remedies and 
therapeutic appliances saw an even sharper 
rise (+28%). The strong growth in expenditure 
on pharmaceuticals (+7½%) and outpatient 
treatment (+6%) continued. By contrast, sick 
pay fell slightly (-½%). At the end of the quar -
ter, the health insurance institutions still had re -
serves of €15 billion (just under two- thirds of 
their average monthly expenditure).
The health insurance institutions are set to re -
cord a significant deficit for 2021 as a whole. In 
autumn 2020, the Ministry of Health projected 
that the institutions’ expenditure would in -
crease by 6½%. The ministry estimated that the 
average additional contribution rate would rise 
by 0.3  percentage point and central govern -
ment funds would increase by €5 billion. The 
institutions were to cover the remaining fund -
ing gap of €8 billion using their reserves.8 Up to 
mid- year, expenditure growth remained some -what below the expectations for the year as a 
whole. In the second half of 2021, it could tend 
to become weaker again as the previous year’s 
figures were inflated by catch- up effects. The 
deficit could thus be only around half the size 
estimated by the Ministry of Health.Health insurance

were down by 5% on the year. Pandemic- related compen -
sation for hospitals was down by just over €3½ billion on 
the year.
8 In autumn 2020, the group of SHI estimators was unable 
to mutually agree on an expenditure estimate. Taking the 
somewhat higher expenditure figure projected by the 
health insurance institutions would even result in a deficit 
of around €9½ billion, assuming that supplementary con -
tribution rates remain unchanged.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

The group of SHI estimators projected that the 
health fund would record a deficit of €1 billion 
for 2021 as a whole because funds from the 
liquidity reserve are to be transferred to the 
health insurance institutions. These are in -
tended to broadly offset the losses due to re -
duced SHI scheme contributions on occupa -
tional pensions. Added to this are the transfers 
to the innovation fund and hospital structures 
fund to be made from the health fund’s re -
serves. However, contribution receipts could 
now develop somewhat more favourably than 
expected. As a result, the fund could achieve a 
balanced budget and the reserves could remain 
almost unchanged at €6½ billion.
Next year, the economic situation and hence 
the contribution base are likely to improve sig -
nificantly. Following the benefit expansions of 
the past, however, there is a structural funding 
gap. To avoid a rise in additional contribution 
rates, lawmakers have already decided on the 
provision of €7 billion in additional central gov -
ernment funds (+€2 billion compared with 
2021). In addition, the health insurance institu -
tions will receive a transfer from the health 
fund’s liquidity reserve provided that it is above 
the fund’s minimum reserve level (likely special 
transfer of just over €1 billion9). The group of 
SHI estimators will project the institutions’ re -
maining funding gap in October. To close this 
gap, the institutions could initially use the 
reserves  still available to them. Once these are 
used up from 2023 onwards, the additional 
contribution rates will have to increase. If, in -
stead, the intention is to close funding gaps 
with continuing and potentially ever larger cen -
tral government grants, adjustments will be 
needed in the central government budget. It is 
foreseeable that there will be no leeway for this 
in the central government budget without rais -
ing taxes or making savings elsewhere.Public long- term care

The public long- term care insurance scheme 
finished the second quarter of 2021 with a def -
icit of €½ billion in the core area.10 In the 
second quarter of 2020, its budget was still in 
balance. This deterioration was due to higher 
pandemic- related special payments (primarily 
aid payments and testing costs).
Revenue rose by €8½%. Employees’ contribu -
tions increased by 5½%, having fallen by just 
under ½% a year earlier owing to the pan -
demic. One factor contributing to the stronger 
growth in other revenue was the fact that the 
long- term care insurance scheme received a 
total of €½ billion from the statutory and pri -
vate health insurance institutions. In line with 
the legal requirements, these institutions thus 
contributed to the funding of the long- term 
care insurance scheme’s pandemic- related spe -
cial payments in the first half of the year. After 
adjustment for this effect, revenue growth 
came to 5%.
Expenditure rose very steeply, by 14%. Like at 
the start of the year, in the second quarter of 
2021, extensive pandemic- related special pay -
ments were made to long- term care institu -
tions, and for tests.11 These special payments 
were up by a total of €1 billion on the year. Health fund

drawals of just under €1 billion in 2022 (payments to the 
innovation fund and the hospital structures fund, and to 
health insurance institutions to compensate for the lower 
contributions on occupational pensions).
10 The developments outlined here and in the remainder 
of the text exclude the provident fund. This fund receives 
transfers from the core area corresponding to the receipts 
from 0.1 percentage point of the contribution rate. Assets 
accumulated in this way are to be depleted again in the 
2030s to dampen the expected contribution rate rise. Up 
to the end of the second quarter, €9 billion was transferred 
to the long- term care provident fund.
11 The long-  term care insurance scheme reimburses non-  
residential and (partially) residential long- term care facilities 
for COVID-  19 testing costs. Furthermore, these facilities re -
ceived financial compensation for additional expenditure 
relating to the pandemic. They were also compensated for 
revenue shortfalls caused by the non- utilisation of long-  
term care services on account of COVID-  19. If there had 
been no pandemic, however, spending on benefits would 
have been higher.Deutsche Bundesbank

Even without these payments, the long- term 
care insurance scheme’s expenditure saw fairly 
strong growth of 6½%: with benefit rates un -
changed, cash benefits increased by 8½% and 
spending on non- cash benefits, a larger ex -
penditure item, went up by 5½%. This was due 
to a strong rise in non- residential non- cash care 
benefits (+12%), which had seen only fairly 
weak growth in the previous year given the 
pandemic- related restrictions. By contrast, 
costs for residential long- term care continued 
to rise only slightly (+½%).
The long- term care insurance scheme’s budget 
balance for the year as a whole looks likely to 
deteriorate substantially. Following a surplus of 
€1½ billion last year, a significant deficit is now 
on the cards. On the revenue side, the add -
itional central government funds will probably 
be reduced from last year’s total of just under 
€2 billion. The new contribution from the statu -
tory and private health insurance institutions 
amounts to just over €½ billion and will largely 
offset this decline. Although the contribution 
base is likely to increasingly recover, the 
pandemic- related burdens will remain notice -
able. On the expenditure side, the pandemic-  
related special payments to long- term care in -
stitutions will now be extended up to the end 
of 2021. As a result, they will probably be 
nearly double their size last year (€2½ billion in 
2020). In addition, regular benefits have been 
clearly expanded in recent years, meaning that 
the underlying pace of expenditure growth is 
fairly high.
Next year, the long-  term care insurance 
scheme’s budget balance will probably improve 
somewhat. As the economy continues to re -
cover, the revenue base is likely to grow con -
siderably. Furthermore, pandemic- related spe -
cial expenditure should then play only a minor 
role. However, additional burdens will be gen -
erated by the latest long- term care reform, 
which will again entail perceptible benefit ex -
pansions.12 These are only partly covered by a 
new central government grant of €1 billion per year and a higher contribution rate for childless 
persons (+0.1 percentage point).
The underlying funding pressures are unlikely 
to relent in the years that follow. Consequently, 
once the available reserves have been used up, 
successive significant rises in contribution rates 
are on the cards from 2023 at the latest. All in 
all, there are already sizeable structural funding 
gaps in the statutory health insurance scheme, 
the statutory pension insurance scheme and 
the public long- term care insurance scheme. In

Securities markets
Bond market
At €146.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in July 2021 was slightly down on 
the June figure (€149.7 billion). After taking ac -
count of redemptions, which increased some -
what, and changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds expanded by €6.3 billion after 
having increased by €15.2 billion in June. For -
eign debt securities worth €5.2 billion were 
placed in the German market, which meant 
that the outstanding volume of domestic and 
foreign debt instruments in Germany rose by 
€11.4 billion on balance.The public sector issued own bonds in the 
amount of €11.6 billion net in the reporting 
month. Central government, in particular, in -
creased its capital market debt on balance (€7.6 
billion), issuing primarily five- year Federal notes 
(Bobls: €5.3 billion) and two- year Federal Treas -
ury notes (Schätze: €4.7 billion). Looking at 
Federal bonds (Bunds), issuance focused on 
longer maturities (30- year maturities: €4.4 bil -
lion, 15- year maturities: €2.3 billion), whereas 
ten- year bonds saw net redemptions totalling 
€11.4 billion. State and local governments issued 
bonds in the amount of €4.1 billion on balance.
Domestic enterprises placed debt securities 
worth €3.8 billion net in the market in July. This 
was mainly attributable to non- financial cor -
porations, which primarily issued paper with a 
maturity of up to one year.
By contrast, German credit institutions scaled 
back their capital market debt by €9.2 billion 
net in the reporting month, primarily redeem -
ing, on balance, debt securities of specialised 
credit institutions (€4.6 billion) and other bank 
debt securities that can be structured flexibly 
(€4.2 billion).
The Bundesbank was the largest buyer in July, 
acquiring debt securities worth €25.1 billion 
net, for the most part under the Eurosystem’s 
asset purchase programmes. These purchases 
almost exclusively involved domestic paper 
issued  by public sector entities. German non-  
banks bought bonds worth €9.4 billion net, the 
bulk of which were foreign securities. By con -
trast, non- resident investors and German credit 
institutions pared back their bond portfolios by 
€17.6 billion and €5.5 billion, respectively.
Equity market
In July, domestic enterprises placed €0.8 billion 
worth of new shares in the German equity 
market. Sales of foreign shares in Germany rose 
by €5.1 billion in the same period. Domestic

net to their portfolios. Foreign investors bought 
German equities for €2.2 billion net, while do -
mestic credit institutions sold shares for €0.1 
billion on balance.
Mutual funds
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded inflows 
of €11.8 billion. The majority of these funds 
were channelled into specialised funds (€7.7 
billion), which are reserved for institutional in -
vestors. Among the various asset classes, the 
chief beneficiaries of the new funds were mixed 
securities funds (€5.6 billion), although bond 
funds (€3.0 billion) and equity and open- end 
real estate funds (€1.4 billion each) also 
profited. Foreign mutual funds sold fund shares 
in the German market for €5.2 billion in net 
terms. On balance, domestic non- banks were 
virtually the only purchasers of mutual fund 
shares in the reporting month (€16.8 billion). 
Domestic credit institutions purchased mutual 
fund shares for €1.1 billion net, while foreign 
investors reduced their fund portfolio in Ger -
many by €0.8 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account posted a surplus of 
€17.6 billion in July 2021, down €5.0 billion on 
the previous month’s level. Although the sur -
plus in the goods account rose, the surplus in 
invisible current transactions, which comprise 
primary and secondary income as well as ser -
vices, declined significantly.
In July, the surplus in the goods account in -
creased by €1.1 billion on the month to €17.5 
billion, with imports of goods contracting more 
sharply than exports.

vices account recorded a shift from a surplus of 
€0.4 billion in June to a deficit of €2.4 billion in 
July. The main reason for this was the sharp rise 
in expenditure by residents on services abroad. 
This affected travel expenditure in particular, as 
the improved pandemic conditions increased 
the opportunities for travelling abroad again. 
As for the secondary income account, the def -
icit widened by €2.8 billion to €5.7 billion. 
Here, too, it was mainly payments abroad, 
which were primarily linked to increased gen -
eral government expenditure on current trans -
fers relating to international cooperation, 
which rose compared with the previous month. 
The surplus in primary income decreased 
slightly by €0.5 billion to €8.2 billion, largely on 
account of a decline in receipts from portfolio 
investment.
International financial markets saw a higher 
level of volatility in July 2021 on the back of 
temporary concerns about growth due to rising 
coronavirus infection numbers in various re -
gions. It was against this backdrop that Germa -
ny’s cross- border portfolio investment recorded 
net capital exports of €31.0 billion (after €38.1 
billion in June). Domestic investors acquired 
foreign securities worth €14.8 billion, purchas -
ing mutual fund shares (€5.2 billion), shares 
(€4.4 billion), bonds (€3.2 billion) and money 
market paper (€1.9 billion). Conversely, foreign 
investors disposed of €16.2 billion worth of 
German securities, which encompassed bonds 
(€14.1 billion), money market paper (€3.5 bil -
lion) and mutual fund shares (€0.8 billion). By 
contrast, they added shares issued in Germany 
to their portfolios (€2.2 billion).
In July, the balance of financial derivatives re -
corded net outflows (€2.0 billion).Direct investment recorded net capital exports 
of €6.5 billion in July (June: €3.9 billion). Do -
mestic enterprises increased their foreign direct 
investment by €4.9 billion. They raised their 
equity capital in foreign enterprises by €7.1 bil -
lion, of which just under half took the form of 
reinvested earnings. By contrast, they recorded 
outflows of funds totalling €2.2 billion through 
intra- group lending. Foreign firms reduced the 
direct investment funds of their subsidiaries 
domiciled in Germany by €1.6 billion. This was 
mainly due to capital outflows in intra- group 
lending (€3.5 billion), primarily attributable to 
the repayment of loans that foreign affiliates 
had previously granted to their domestic parent 
companies. Conversely, the branches of foreign 
enterprises in Germany saw inflows of equity 
capital (€1.9 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
inflows amounting to €46.6 billion in July (fol -
lowing €17.9 billion in June). In this context, 
the Bundesbank attracted net inflows of funds 
from abroad (€60.7 billion). This was chiefly be -
cause TARGET2 claims on the ECB fell consider -
ably (€76.9 billion). On the other hand, there 
was a decline in the Bundesbank’s liabilities vis- 
à- vis non- residents (€12.7 billion), especially 
non- euro area residents. Monetary financial in -
stitutions (excluding the Bundesbank) recorded 
net capital exports (€26.6 billion). Transactions 
by enterprises and households (€12.4 billion) 
and by general government (€0.1 billion) each 
led, on balance, to net capital inflows.

The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy is the overarching conceptual framework within which 
the ECB and national central banks take concrete monetary policy decisions. The main elements 
of the strategy are the operationalisation of price stability, the policy approach to safeguarding 
price stability, and the framework for assessing and processing the relevant information for mon -
etary policy decisions and communication to the public.
The ECB Governing Council last reviewed its strategy in 2003. Since then, however, many new devel -
opments and challenges have materialised. The most important of these is the further decline in the 
equilibrium real interest rate. In combination with an effective lower bound on short- term nominal 
interest rates, this development leads to a substantial reduction of the monetary policy space.
The Governing Council published its new monetary policy strategy in July 2021. A key new elem -
ent is the symmetric inflation target of 2% over the medium term. The slightly higher level ensures 
the right balance between the benefits of a safety margin against deflation and the costs of 
higher inflation rates. Symmetry means that the Governing Council considers negative and posi -
tive deviations of inflation from its target to be equally undesirable. To ensure this symmetry, the 
Governing Council recognises the importance of taking into account the implications of the effect -
ive lower bound. When interest rates are close to this effective lower bound, especially forceful 
or persistent monetary policy actions are necessary to avoid negative deviations from the infla -
tion target becoming entrenched. This may also imply a transitory period in which the inflation 
rate is moderately above target.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) remains the preferred measure of inflation 
against which to judge the achievement of the policy objective. However, the Eurosystem aims to 
improve the quality of the HICP by including the cost of owner- occupied housing. The Eurosystem 
will also maintain its medium- term orientation. Furthermore, a comprehensive assessment of all 
relevant factors will continue to underpin monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB Governing 
Council, including the review of the proportionality and potential side effects of its decisions. This 
assessment builds on two interdependent analyses: the economic analysis and the monetary and 
financial analysis. In the future, the Eurosystem intends to fully take into account the interdepend -
ence between these two analytical perspectives, in addition to explicitly accounting for how 
financial stability aspects affect price stability and having due regard for the importance of 
observing the transmission mechanism for the calibration of monetary policy instruments.
Nominal key interest rates will remain the primary monetary policy instrument. However, the 
Eurosystem will keep using a combination of unconventional measures as a way of retaining its 
policy space close to the effective lower bound.
Within the scope of its mandate, the Eurosystem will fully take into account the implications of 
climate change and the transition to a low- carbon economy. While responsibility for climate pro -
tection lies primarily with national governments, climate change will also affect macroeconomic 
price developments. The Eurosystem will therefore significantly expand its analytical and model -
ling capacities in this area. It will furthermore adapt the design of its monetary policy operational 
framework in relation to disclosures, risk assessment, corporate sector asset purchases and the 
collateral framework.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Safeguarding price stability is the primary ob -
jective of the Eurosystem.1 This mandate is en -
shrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union (TFEU). While the TFEU sets 
out the Eurosystem’s mandate, it is up to the 
Eurosystem itself to decide how it goes about 
operationalising and achieving this objective. 
For this purpose, the Governing Council of the 
European Central Bank (ECB), in its capacity as 
the Eurosystem’s supreme decision- making 
body, develops a monetary policy strategy. This 
strategy defines how the primary objective of 
price stability in the euro area is to be achieved 
and which monetary policy instruments and in -
dicators are suitable for this purpose. The strat -
egy thus stakes out a systematic framework 
within which the ECB Governing Council takes 
monetary policy decisions geared towards price 
stability and explains these decisions to the 
public.
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy was 
first drawn up in 1998 and last reviewed in 
2003. Since then, the euro area economies 
have experienced numerous developments. 
Combined with the persistent challenges to the 
implementation of monetary policy, these war -
ranted an update of the strategy. The review 
process lasted one- and- a- half years and cul -
minated in the ECB Governing Council publish -
ing its new monetary policy strategy on 8 July 
2021.
This article offers an explanation of the Euro -
system’s new monetary policy strategy begin -
ning with the previous monetary policy strategy 
and the key changes that have taken place in 
the macroeconomic environment. Given that 
many topics were addressed during the strat -
egy review, it is impossible for this article to 
cover the review in its entirety.2 The article will 
instead focus on three selected aspects that 
form the essence of the monetary policy strat -
egy: the operationalisation of price stability, the 
policy approach to safeguarding price stability, 
and the framework for assessing and process -ing the relevant information for monetary pol -
icy decisions and communication to the public.
Main elements of the Euro -
system’s previous monetary 
policy strategy
The previous monetary policy strategy, which 
was adopted by the Eurosystem in 2003, es -
sentially rested on three main elements:
– First, the strategy was based on a double-key 
formulation of the price stability objective. 
The first component was a quantitative def -
inition of price stability. According to this 
definition, prices were considered stable if 
the year- on- year increase in the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)3 was below 
2% over the medium term. The second com -
ponent was the policy objective, which was 
to maintain HICP inflation “below, but close 
to, 2%” over the medium term within the 
definition of price stability. On the one hand, 
this was intended to provide a sufficient 
safety margin against deflation, i.e. an envir -
onment of persistently falling prices that can 
result in severe economic damage.4 On the The Euro system’s

1 The Eurosystem is made up of the European Central Bank 
and the central banks of EU Member States whose cur -
rency is the euro.
2 See the box on pp. 19 f.
3 The HICP is a price index harmonised across the Member 
States of the euro area that measures changes over time in 
household spending on a representative basket of goods.
4 Deflation is primarily an issue in cases where it sets in 
motion a self- perpetuating downward wage- price spiral. 
People expecting prices to decline further in the future 
might decide to hold back on spending, which could force 
enterprises to throttle their output, depressing wages and 
eliminating jobs. In an extreme scenario, this can send the 
economy as a whole into a downward spiral, with price 
and wage cuts, shrinking output and rising unemployment 
all reinforcing one another. A deflationary situation can fur -
thermore significantly increase enterprises’ and house -
holds’ real debt burden to the point of looming overindebt -
edness because, whereas deflation drives down the prices 
of the goods offered by enterprises and tends to depress 
wages, nominal loan repayments remain unchanged. 
Hence, the real burden of existing repayment obligations 
increases in an environment of generally falling prices. This 
can increase the incidence of payment defaults and also 
the volume of non- performing loans carried on commercial 
banks’ balance sheets (a phenomenon known as debt de -
flation), which can ultimately jeopardise financial stability 
and cause further damage to the economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Organisation of the Eurosystem’s strategy review
At its meeting on 23  January 2020, the 
ECB’s Governing Council decided to launch 
a review of the Eurosystem’s monetary pol-
icy strategy, which it completed on 8 July 
2021. At irregular intervals during this 
period, the Governing Council discussed a 
broad range of topics relating to its monet-
ary policy strategy. These discussions 
formed the basis for the Governing Coun-
cil’s decisions on the new monetary policy 
strategy.1
The discussions incorporated feedback from 
numerous events with stakeholders from 
various sections of society, organised in a 
variety of formats:
– Listening events: At numerous events 
hosted by the ECB and national central 
banks (NCBs), a wide range of civil soci-
ety organisations described how they are 
affected by, and what they expect of, 
monetary policy.2
– Online portals: Here members of the 
general public were invited to express 
their expectations and concerns by par-
ticipating in surveys on price stability, 
economic developments and central 
bank communication.3
– Specialist conferences: Representatives 
of academic institutions, research facil-
ities and the fi  nancial sector held presen-
tations and discussed these with a broad 
specialist audience.4
– Dialogue with the European Parlia-
ment: In hearings of the Committee on 
Economic and Monetary Affairs, regu-
lar discussions were held about the topics and the status of the strategy 
review .
In addition, information collected by sep-
arate work streams set up to look at key 
topics fed into the Governing Council’s 
deliberations. These work streams, com-
prising employees from the ECB and the 
Eurosystem’s NCBs, prepared analyses 
tailored to the strategy review and worked 
through the relevant literature, paying at-
tention to interdependencies and connect-
ing factors between the individual topics. 
Based on their fi  ndings, the work streams 
drew up reports and background docu-
ments, which were incorporated into the

other hand, the policy objective also ad -
dressed possible measurement bias in the 
HICP5 and the implications of inflation differ -
entials within the euro area.
– The second main element of the previous 
monetary policy strategy was the medium-  
term orientation. It gave the ECB Governing 
Council a flexible time horizon within which 
to bring consumer price inflation consist -
ently in line with the price stability objective. 
Consideration was thus given to the fact 
that monetary policy measures have variable 
transmission lags and that monetary policy -
makers calibrate their measures to suit the 
nature of the shocks hitting the euro area.6 
Since different types of shocks affect price 
developments and the real economy in dif -
ferent ways, eliminating all the ups and 
downs in the short term is not warranted, as 
that could produce unnecessary cyclical 
volatility and thus put price stability at risk.
– Third, the risks to price stability were as -
sessed using a two-  pillar approach relying 
on an economic analysis and a monetary an -
alysis. Insights gained from these two pillars 
were cross-  checked by the ECB Governing 
Council to form a unified overall judgement. 
The economic analysis examined the short 
to medium- term factors in the real economy 
that had a bearing on price developments, 
and looked primarily at developments in the 
real economy and cost factors that might be 
driving prices. Meanwhile, the monetary an -
alysis took a medium to long- term perspec -
tive. During the early years of the monetary 
union, it focused on the longer- term rela -
tionship between money and prices. More 
recently, particularly in the aftermath of the 
financial crisis and the introduction of un -
conventional monetary policy measures, the 
monetary analysis has shifted in focus to -
wards monetary policy transmission through 
the financial sector.7Why review the monetary 
policy strategy?
The macroeconomic environment has changed 
substantially since the last strategy review in 
2003. In addition, the financial crisis has dem -
onstrated the importance of financial stability 
as a precondition for price stability.8 It was a 
major catalyst for the introduction of the bank -
ing union and macroprudential policy, herald -
ing lasting changes to the institutional set- up 
of the Eurosystem. Globalisation and digitalisa -
tion as well as the ongoing process of climate 
change are additional key drivers of economic 
trends and developments that also spill over 
into price developments.
However, the main new challenge that has 
emerged for monetary policymakers is that 
structural changes9 contributed to a noticeable 
decline in the equilibrium real interest rate.10 
This real rate decline also plays a decisive role in 2. Medium- term

5 Measurement bias can occur, for instance, if quality im -
provements are not suitably factored into goods price de -
velopments. Furthermore, the empirical finding of down -
ward nominal wage rigidities was seen as another reason 
to strive for a positive rate of inflation.
6 Furthermore, the monetary policy transmission process is 
fraught with uncertainty. This process describes how mon -
etary policy impulses are transmitted to the real economy 
and comprises a number of different mechanisms and re -
sponses on the part of economic agents at various stages 
of the transmission process.
7 The Eurosystem’s previous monetary policy strategy is 
presented in detail in European Central Bank (2011), Chap -
ter 3, and Rostagno et al. (2021).
8 One threat during the financial and sovereign debt crisis 
was that negative feedback loops between the financial 
system and real economy caused by looming shortages in 
the supply of credit and the like might set a downward 
spiral in motion and jeopardise price stability.
9 These developments include the decline in productivity 
growth, demographic factors and persistently higher de -
mand for safe and liquid assets in the wake of the global 
financial crisis.
10 This is the short- term real interest rate that, in the long 
run, is consistent with aggregate production at potential 
and stable inflation. The precise level of the equilibrium real 
interest rate is unobservable, and estimating it is fraught 
with considerable uncertainty. Studies nonetheless agree 
that the equilibrium real interest rate is trending down -
wards, not only in the euro area but worldwide. See, for 
example, Brand et al. (2018), Holston et al. (2017) and 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b).Deutsche Bundesbank

the trend decline in nominal interest rates.11 A 
low interest rate environment is particularly 
problematic because it increases the likelihood 
that policy rates will hit the lower bound in the 
event of negative shocks.12 This prevents mon -
etary policy from further rate cuts in order to 
generate additional upside pressure on the in -
flation rate.13
The low inflation rates observed in recent years 
were the backdrop for mounting criticism of 
certain components of the previous strategy. 
For example, the previous operationalisation of 
price stability contained an asymmetry that 
might have contributed to a persistent negative 
deviation of inflation expectations from the in -
flation target. Permanently lower inflation ex -
pectations – in addition to depressed real inter -
est rates  – contribute to declines in nominal 
interest rates and thus further limit the policy 
space.
This asymmetry arose from setting the policy 
objective (below, but close to, 2%, medium 
term) at the upper limit of the range that de -
fines price stability (below 2%, medium term). 
As a result, upside deviations of the inflation 
rate from the policy objective were compatible 
neither with the definition of price stability nor 
with the policy objective itself. By contrast, 
downside deviations of the inflation rate were 
generally consistent with the price stability def -
inition, though not necessarily with the policy 
objective. This meant that, as long as devi -
ations to the downside did not lead to defla -
tion, they were deemed less problematic than 
those to the upside. Even if they were not com -
patible with the policy objective, they were still 
consistent with the definition of price stability. 
This asymmetric operationalisation of price sta -
bility thus left some room for interpretation in 
the event of downside deviations: at what level 
did the inflation rate still satisfy the policy ob -
jective criterion of being “close to 2%”?
This design possibly also implied an asymmetric 
monetary policy response, whereby policy -
makers responded more vigorously to positive than to negative inflation rate deviations from 
the policy objective. Viewed in isolation, this 
could have been read as implying that negative 
deviations from the intended inflation rate can 
be larger and longer- lasting than positive ones, 
potentially culminating in persistent episodes 
of low inflation rates. Combined with the 
effect ive lower bound, the previous operation -
alisation of price stability – particularly in an en -
vironment of adverse shocks to demand – thus 
had the potential to depress longer- term infla -
tion expectations. If true, this would have com -
plicated the Eurosystem’s efforts to achieve the 
policy objective on a lasting basis.14… and asym -
metry under pre -
vious strategy 
made it harder 
to achieve policy  
objective
11 Arbitrage considerations can be used to derive what is 
known as the Fisher equation, which states that the level of 
nominal interest rates can be computed by adding to -
gether the equilibrium real interest rate and the expected 
rate of inflation. Assuming monetary policy is credible, the 
inflation expectation in the long- run equilibrium will equal 
the central bank’s inflation target. Hence, a falling equilib -
rium real interest rate lowers the level of nominal interest 
rates for a given inflation target.
12 Since currency holdings are unremunerated, the nom -
inal short-  term interest rate cannot fall infinitely below 
zero. From a certain point, which depends inter alia on 
cash transaction and storage costs, non- banks will with -
draw their deposits and hold them as cash. In this scenario, 
further monetary policy rate cuts will largely be powerless 
to affect inflation and, because of the deposit withdrawals 
they induce, can in fact jeopardise financial stability. Fur -
thermore, banks might feel compelled by the deeply nega -
tive interest rates to curb their supply of credit, which 
would be counterproductive in monetary policy terms. The 
interest rate level at which the initially accommodative ef -
fect of negative rates turns contractionary is called the re -
versal rate (Brunnermeier and Koby (2018)). However, this 
de facto, or effective, lower bound for interest rates is un -
observable, changes over time and can only be roughly ap -
proximated. This article also uses the term “effective lower 
bound” in the following.
13 This is why the Eurosystem has deployed unconven -
tional instruments such as forward guidance (since 2013) 
and extensive asset purchases (particularly since 2015). For -
ward guidance is generally understood to mean communi -
cating the expected deployment and path of monetary pol -
icy instruments.
14 The real interest rate is crucially important for stabilising 
demand. When economic agents expect declining inflation 
or even deflation, the real interest rate rises, when taken in 
isolation (via the Fisher equation), slowing down invest -
ment and growth. The central bank can temporarily lower 
the real interest rate by reducing the nominal interest rate. 
If, however, it is unable to cut interest rates any further at 
the effective lower bound, the real interest rate will ultim -
ately be determined, approximately, by inflation expect -
ations. In principle, this can produce a deflationary spiral, 
because the expectation of deflation pushes up the real 
interest rate, which in turn reduces demand and hence the 
inflation rate, potentially causing deflation to become en -
trenched.Deutsche Bundesbank

The idea behind the strategy review was to 
align the existing strategy with these new chal -
lenges. The box on pp.  19 f. outlines all the 
topics covered by the review, its components 
and how it was organised. This article now 
turns its attention to the operationalisation of 
price stability, the policy approach to safe -
guarding price stability, and the framework for 
assessing and processing the relevant informa -
tion for monetary policy decisions and commu -
nication to the public.
The new Eurosystem 
monetary  policy strategy
Overview of key decisions
This section begins by presenting the key deci -
sions on the new monetary policy strategy – the 
background to, and intentions of, the decisions 
will be discussed in the subsequent sections.
– The Governing Council of the ECB confirmed 
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) as the appropriate measure for as -
sessing the achievement of the price stability 
objective in the euro area. In its future mon -
etary policy assessments, the Governing 
Council wishes to also use measures of infla -
tion which include the costs of owner-  
occupied housing. While only initial esti -
mates of these costs are available in the 
short term, the aim is for full inclusion of the 
costs of owner- occupied housing in the 
HICP in the long term (see the “Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices” section).
– The Governing Council considers that price 
stability is best maintained by aiming for a 
2% annual HICP inflation rate over the me -
dium term. The Governing Council’s com -
mitment to this target is symmetric. Sym -
metry in this context means that negative 
and positive deviations of inflation from the 
target are considered to be equally undesir -
able. To maintain the symmetry of its infla -
tion target, the Governing Council recog -nises the importance of taking into account 
the implications of the effective lower 
bound. When nominal interest rates in the 
euro area are close to the effective lower 
bound, especially forceful or persistent mon -
etary policy action should be taken to avoid 
negative deviations from the inflation target 
becoming entrenched.15 This may imply a 
transitory period in which inflation is moder -
ately above target16 (see the sections below 
entitled “Point target for the inflation rate of 
2%”, “Symmetry of the inflation target” and 
“Medium- term orientation retained”).
– The primary monetary policy instrument of 
the Eurosystem is the set of ECB policy rates. 
In recognition of the effective lower bound 
on policy rates, the Governing Council will 
employ asset purchases, longer- term refi -
nancing operations and forward guidance, 
as appropriate. As before, the combined and 
calibrated use of various instruments is in -
tended to ensure that the Eurosystem re -
mains able to react even when close to the 
effective lower bound on interest rates (see 
the sections entitled “Unconventional meas -
ures at the effective lower bound” and 
“Asymmetric monetary policy response to 
deviations from the inflation target”).
– The basis for the Governing Council’s mon -
etary policy decisions, including the evalu -
ation of proportionality and possible side ef -
fects, is an integrated assessment of all fac -
tors relevant to price stability. This assess -
ment builds on two interdependent analyses: 
the economic analysis and the monetary 
and financial analysis. The economic analysis 
will continue to focus on real and nominal 
economic developments. The original “mon -
etary pillar” will, however, become an ex -
panded monetary and financial analysis. Its 
main focus will now be the analysis of mon -
etary policy transmission via the financial 
sector and the possible risks to medium-  Latest review

The relationship between the equilibrium real interest rate, 
the level of the infl  ation target and monetary policy space
The euro area and other leading industrial 
countries have seen a decline in the general 
interest rate level over the past decades. 
There is a broad consensus that this has not 
been caused primarily by monetary policy 
but that it is more a refl  ection of long- term 
structural trends. Indeed, an ageing popula-
tion, shifts in the distribution of income and 
wealth, and slower growth in productivity 
(and thus in potential output) have, since 
the 1980s, been refl  ected in a downward 
movement in the equilibrium real interest 
rate, not only in the euro area but world-
wide.1
These developments pose considerable 
challenges for monetary policy because the 
level of the equilibrium real interest rate, in 
combination with the level of the infl  ation 
target, is what determines average nominal 
interest rates. If the equilibrium real interest 
rate declines, so, too, does the safety mar-
gin between policy rates and the effective 
lower bound for a given target infl  ation 
rate. Put another way, there is a reduction 
in the monetary policy space available for 
expansionary action through lowering the 
short- term nominal interest rate. As a re-
sult, the incidence and duration of episodes 
at the effective lower bound tend to in-
crease,2 leaving monetary policy less able to 
safeguard price stability via the policy rate 
alone.
Compared with the situation in 2003, when 
the Eurosystem last reviewed its monetary 
policy strategy, there has been a big change 
in the assessment of the level of the equilib-
rium real interest rate. This is why the latest 
monetary policy strategy review paid par-
ticular attention to how the level of the 
equilibrium real interest rate infl  uences monetary policy space. Consideration was 
also given to the potential scope for in-
creasing monetary policy space by raising 
the infl  ation target. Setting a higher infl  a-
tion target would push up the average 
nominal interest rate level provided that in-
fl  ation expectations adjust to the infl  ation 
target.3 Viewed in isolation, this would 
widen the safety margin to the effective 
lower bound and thus also reduce the like-
lihood of hitting that effective lower bound.
Below, we provide a quantitative illustration 
of the relationship between the equilibrium 
real interest rate, the level of the infl  ation 
1 The equilibrium real interest rate is the real interest 
rate level that is compatible with a closed output gap 
(when aggregate output is equal to its potential) and 
with price stability. Being unobservable directly, the 
level of the equilibrium real interest rate can only be 
estimated using appropriate macroeconomic tech-
niques. That is why any statements on the equilibrium 
real interest rate are fraught with considerable estima-
tion and model uncertainty. Nonetheless, most empir-
ical research papers conclude that the equilibrium real 
interest rate has fallen over the past decades. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2017a), Brandt et al. (2018) 
and Mian et al. (2021).
2 Schematically, this relationship can be described as 
follows: viewed in isolation, the decline in the equilib-
rium real interest rate leads to a fall in nominal interest 
rates via the Fisher equation (see footnote 11 in the 
main article), thus narrowing the margin between 
nominal interest rates and the effective lower bound. 
A smaller margin to the effective lower bound implies 
in turn that defl  ationary shocks will be associated with 
more frequent and longer- lasting episodes at the ef-
fective lower bound. If these shocks are large enough 
to trigger a decline in nominal interest rates, the nar-
rower margin means that the effective lower bound 
will be reached sooner.
3 This follows from the Fisher equation. The analysis 
here disregards possible changes in the behaviour of 
economic agents in an environment of higher infl  ation 
rates. For example, interest rate cuts have a less expan-
sionary effect in an environment of higher infl  ation 
rates. In addition, the risk of infl  ation expectations be-
coming unanchored increases. See Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2018) for further details.Deutsche Bundesbank

target, and monetary policy space4 using a 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) model estimated with euro area 
data. The present model5 is simulated for 
different assumptions of the level of the 
equilibrium annual (net) real interest rate r* 
and for different assumptions of the level of 
the annual (net) infl  ation target Π*, assum-
ing an annual (net) nominal effective lower 
bound of RELB = – 0.5% throughout. 
Above the effective lower bound, the cen-
tral bank sets its policy rate based on an 
interest rate rule that uses the lagged inter-
est rate level, deviations in infl  ation from its 
target, and output growth as inputs. Hence, 
the interest rate is set as follows:
Rt = max {RS
t.RELB}, where RS
t is given 
by:
RS
t= 0.85RS
t−1+ 0.15( r⇤+⇧⇤
+(YtYt−1) + 1.5( ⇧t⇧⇤)).
Here, RS
t stands for the annual (net) shadow 
interest rate that would be set in the ab-
sence of the effective lower bound, Rt for 
the annual (net) policy rate that is actually 
set, Πt for the annual (net) infl  ation rate, 
and (Yt – Yt–1) for the (net) output growth 
rate, with Yt standing for output (in logs).
2,500 model simulations are carried out to 
identify the frequency with which the cen-
tral bank hits the effective lower bound 
with its policy rate. The model is subject 
to  unexpected economic developments 
(shocks) in each period and simulated for 
200 periods in each case.6
The above chart shows the incidence of the 
binding effective lower bound (y- axis) for 
different infl  ation targets (x- axis) and real 
interest rates (differently coloured lines). In 
essence, three conclusions can be drawn 
from the simulations.– First, a lower equilibrium real interest 
rate r* for a given infl  ation target in-
creases the frequency with which the 
policy rate hits the effective lower bound. 
This is shown by the upward shift in the 
lines plotted in the chart above when a 
lower real interest rate is assumed. Given 
an assumed infl  ation target of 2%, say, a 
decline in the equilibrium real interest 
rate from 1% to 0.5% increases the inci-
4 The following analysis disregards the possibility of 
the central bank being able to implement alternative 
monetary policy measures at the effective lower 
bound, such as forward guidance or asset purchase 
programmes. The aim here is merely to provide a 
quantitative description of the expected monetary pol-
icy space with respect to the traditional policy rate in-
strument depending on the level of the equilibrium 
real interest rate and the infl  ation target.
5 See Gerke et al. (2020) for a detailed description of 
the underlying model and how it is calibrated. In es-
sence, the model resembles the generally known and 
widely used model of Smets and Wouters (2007), but 
differs in that it also features a fi  nancial market mod-
elled as in Carlstrom et al. (2017). The model further-
more includes a heterogeneous household sector, one 
section of which is unable to smooth its consumption 
over time because of the assumption that it is unable 
to borrow or save (see also Galí et al. (2007) and Bil-
biie (2008)).
6 The simulations are described in detail in Gerke et al. 
(2021). The model is simulated using a version of the

term price stability that may arise from finan -
cial imbalances and monetary factors. The 
pervasive role of macro- financial linkages in 
economic, monetary and financial develop -
ments requires that the interdependencies 
across the two analyses are fully incorpor -

price development”).
Operationalising price stability
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
Price stability has been measured on the basis 
of the HICP for the euro area ever since the ori -
ginal monetary policy strategy was formulated 
in 1998.17 The choice of the HICP for measur -
ing price stability was reaffirmed during the re -
cent strategy review.18 The HICP measures price 
developments in a timely and reliable way and is comparable across countries.19 It is designed 
as a cost of goods index which captures the 
purchasing power of consumers based on the 
price of a representative basket of goods. HICP 
weights are updated annually to ensure that 
the index is underpinned by the most up- to- 
date consumption structures at all times. The 
basket of goods contains only goods and ser -
vices that can be obtained on markets through 
actual monetary transactions.20 The HICP is 
published monthly and is, in principle, not 
HICP confirmed 
as measure of 
price stabilitydence of episodes at the effective lower 
bound by around 4 percentage points, 
from roughly 26.5% to around 30.5%. A 
further decline in the equilibrium real 
interest rate to 0% raises that incidence 
to approximately 34%.
– Second, a higher infl  ation target reduces 
the incidence of policy interest rates hit-
ting the effective lower bound. For ex-
ample, if the infl  ation target is raised 
from 1.5% to 2%, given an equilibrium 
real interest rate of 0.5%, this reduces 
the incidence from around 33% to 
roughly 30%.
– Third, scenarios in which both the equi-
librium real interest rate and the infl  ation 
target are low are particularly daunting. 
Thus, a real interest rate of 0% com-
bined with an infl  ation target of 1.5% puts effective lower bound episodes at 
an incidence of roughly 37%.
In summary, we can conclude the follow-
ing. For a decline in the equilibrium real 
interest rate, the simulation results show a 
notable increase in the incidence of effect-
ive lower bound episodes. As the level of 
the equilibrium real interest rate in the euro 
area has fallen since the 2003 strategy re-
view (even though the precise level is sub-
ject to great uncertainty), there is a greater 
risk, when viewed in isolation, that policy 
rates will hit their effective lower bound 
more frequently in the future. This is one 
reason why the Eurosystem, in the latest re-
view of its monetary policy strategy, agreed, 
amongst other things, to set an infl  ation 
target of 2%, which is slightly above the 
target infl  ation rate selected in 2003.
17 The EU treaties specify price stability as the objective of 
the European System of Central Banks (Official Journal of 
the European Union, 2012/ C 326/ 01, in particular Article 
127). It was operationalised by the Governing Council of 
the ECB in 1998 and refined in 2003; see European Central 
Bank (1999 and 2003).

20 Estimated (imputed) prices are included only in excep -
tional cases, e.g. when extrapolating prices for food that is 
only seasonally available, or when extrapolating prices for 
products that could not be offered during the coronavirus 
pandemic. See, for example, Eurostat (2018), particularly

revised  .21 The euro area index is obtained by 
aggre gating country data derived from the 
national  consumer price indices (CPIs), incorp -
orating certain harmonisations.22 These proper -
ties of the HICP ensure that households view it 
as representative of their purchasing power.23 
This creates the basis for an understandable 
monetary policy. Other indicators, such as 
measures of underlying inflation24 or the GDP 
deflator, do not meet these requirements to 
the same degree.25 However, they can help 
identify the medium-  term trend in the HICP 
rate and therefore continue to play an import -
ant role in the economic analysis.
To strengthen the HICP and thus the credibility 
of monetary policy, it is important for Eurostat 
and the national statistical offices to maintain 
and steadily enhance the quality of the HICP 
even in a changing environment (e.g. increas -
ing online sales, dynamic and personalised pri -
cing). To this end, a focus of the strategy review  
was the inclusion of owner- occupied housing 
(OOH). It has so far been absent from the HICP 
but is material to enhancing the representative -
ness of the HICP and its cross- country compar -
ability. Living in one’s own home is an import -
ant element of household consumption, but 
the costs of this have not been included in the 
HICP thus far. The main reasons for OOH being 
excluded up to now were unresolved issues 
surrounding the specific measurement concept 
and a lack of data sources, even though OOH 
is integrated into the national consumer price 
indices of certain countries – albeit using differ -
ent methods.26 After the first strategy review in 
2003, during which the wish to include OOH 
had been reaffirmed, work began on the devel -
opment of harmonised OOH price indices 
(OOHPIs). These price indices have been pub -
lished by Eurostat on a quarterly basis for all 
euro area countries (except Greece) for some 
years now.27 They start in 2010 and follow the 
net acquisition approach, meaning that they 
capture monetary expenditures for OOH and 
are thus consistent with the HICP method -
ology.As an outcome of the most recent strategy re -
view, the Eurosystem has voiced its express 
wish to Eurostat that the existing OOHPIs be 
linked to the HICPs for the euro area and all 
Member States, initially on a quarterly basis. 
OOH- augmented quarterly HICPs could be pro -
vided by statistical offices as experimental stat -
istics from 2023 and as official statistics from 
2026. Providing them as official statistics will 
require a time- consuming change to the Euro -
pean legal framework. In parallel, work is to be 
undertaken on the data sources, on the one 
hand, in order to achieve full integration into 
the monthly HICP without sacrificing timeli -
ness. On the other hand, unresolved methodo -
logical issues are to be investigated further 
with the support of the Eurosystem. These 
issues primarily relate to the fact that OOH – as 
well as being used as a consumer good – also 
has the quality of an asset.28HICP quality

21 One exception to this rule was, in particular, the revision 
of the “package holidays” component of the HICP for Ger -
many in 2019, which also affected the inflation rate for the 
euro area. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019a).
22 These harmonisations relate, for example, to the stand -
ard inclusion of certain goods and services (without har -
monising the national baskets of goods, however), the 
treatment of discounts and the price collection period. See 
Eurostat (2018), particularly pp. 16 ff. Harmonisation makes 
the data for the individual countries comparable. This is 
why the HICP also serves as a convergence criterion.
23 See also Issing (2003a), particularly p. 12.
24 These include, for example, core rates, trimmed means 
or estimated trends; see Work stream on inflation measure -
ment (2021), in particular Section 6.
25 The last strategy review already came to this conclusion 
as well; see, for example, Camba- Mendez (2003). Core 
rates, for instance, exclude certain HICP components and 
thus do not represent total purchasing power. Conversely, 
the GDP deflator contains the prices of export goods, for 
instance, which have virtually no bearing on the purchasing 
power of domestic consumers.
26 For example, OOH is included in Germany’s national CPI 
using the rental equivalence approach, but is not included 
at all in the national CPIs of Belgium, France, Italy and 
Spain. The Bundesbank has always advocated efforts to 
harmonise the measurement of OOH and to integrate it 
into the HICP; this wish was also expressed by the public at 
numerous listening events held during the latest strategy 
review.
27 The European Commission’s (2018) key reasons for re -
jecting the integration of OOH into the HICP were that 
OOHPIs are not produced frequently enough, are published 
too late and partially include the price of land.
28 In addition, weights must be calculated to integrate the 
OOHPIs into the HICP . OOH is likely to account for around 
10% of the euro area HICP .Deutsche Bundesbank

Preliminary analyses by the Eurosystem29 show 
that the inflation rates of internally computed 
analytical HICPs including OOH would, in prin -
ciple, fluctuate somewhat more strongly than 
those without OOH. They could experience 
phases in which they are around one- quarter 
of a percentage point higher or lower than the 
official HICP rate. The mean of both series 
would be more or less identical, though.30
Aside from including OOH, it is important to 
further enhance the quality of the HICP and 
continually adapt it to new conditions. This is 
particularly the case when it comes to harmon -
ising the integration of new products, the ap -
plication of quality adjustment procedures and 
the selection of samples when collecting prices. 
At the same time, the inclusion of new data 
sources and methods in particular places high 
transparency requirements on the communica -
tion of HICP figures.31 This is particularly true in 
times of shocks, which can lead to significant 
fluctuations in the HICP , as experience of the 
recent pandemic has shown, for example.32
Even though the HICP is of a high quality and is 
constantly being refined, price measurement 
using the HICP – just the same as with other 
statistical variables – is subject to a certain de -
gree of uncertainty and is likely to somewhat 
overestimate inflation on average.33 This was 
an important reason for defining price stability 
as a positive annual HICP rate and establishing 
an inflation buffer in 2003.34 There are no more 
recent findings on the size of the bias arising 
from all sources of measurement bias (includ -
ing aggregation procedures and weighting, in -
complete quality adjustment, delayed inclusion 
of new products and changed distribution 
channels, sampling errors),35 meaning that the 
measurement bias problem, in and of itself, 
does not necessitate any adjustment to the 
price stability objective.36 With a view to future 
strategy reviews, in particular, it would be im -
portant to close this gap in our knowledge. To 
this end, the microdata underlying the price 
statistics should be made more widely available to researchers and transparency about detailed 
methodologies should be established.
The inflation differentials between the euro 
area countries – another important reason for 
the establishment of an inflation buffer follow -
ing the 2003 strategy review  – have barely 
changed over the past two decades; taken in 
isolation, they likewise do not imply any need 
for an adjustment to the price stability object -
ive.
Point target for the inflation rate of 2%
The level of the target inflation rate is the result 
of weighing the pros of low inflation against 
the cons of setting too low a target for infla -
tion. The Governing Council of the ECB con -
siders that price stability is best maintained by 
aiming for a 2% HICP inflation rate over the 
medium term. The formulation of the price sta -
bility objective as a specific quantitative target 
replaces the previous double- key formulation 
of the objective.
In a departure from the previous monetary pol -
icy strategy, the Governing Council’s new strat -
egy does not contain an explicit formal defin -
ition of price stability. Instead, it sets a target … and further

30 A similar picture emerges for Germany, according to the 
Bundesbank’s preliminary analyses.
31 See, for example, Eiglsperger (2019a).
32 In Germany, for example, there is a great need for trans -
parency, particularly in relation to the package holidays 
HICP sub- index in combination with the HICP’s chain-linking 
principle. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b, 2019a, 2019b

34 See, for example, European Central Bank (1999 and 
2003) and Camba- Mendez (2003).
35 There are, however, findings on the size of the bias 
from individual sources of measurement bias. For example, 
Herzberg  et al. (2021) showed that the bias stemming from 
the assumption of a temporarily fixed basket of goods (rep -
resentativity bias) in Germany and the euro area is only 
slightly positive; at the same time, updating the weighting 
scheme more frequently using provisional data to calculate 
the weights would potentially result in new measurement 
uncertainties (vintage bias).

inflation rate of 2% and considers this to best 
maintain price stability. Compared with a target 
inflation rate of 0%, a 2% target offers crucial 
advantages when it comes to maintaining price 
stability. Some of these advantages were al -
ready key reasons for the policy aim set during 
the last strategy review in 2003 and continue 
to exist today.
One such advantage of a 2% inflation rate is 
that it provides a necessary safety margin 
against deflation, i.e. a setting of persistently 
falling prices.37 This kind of setting can lead to 
severe economic losses and should therefore be 
avoided. A higher target inflation rate increases 
this safety margin, on the one hand. On the 
other, it raises the average nominal interest 
rates.38 This, in turn, gives interest rate policy 
more space to avoid deflationary outcomes.
The equilibrium real interest rate has fallen fur -
ther since the last strategy review, which in and 
of itself suggests implementing a higher target 
inflation rate, in order to increase the interest 
rate policy space and be able to better stabilise 
inflation at the target inflation rate.39 The new 
operationalisation of price stability (2%, me -
dium term) is, in fact, a slight increase com -
pared to the previous policy aim (below, but 
close to 2%, medium term). The Governing 
Council of the ECB is thereby taking into ac -
count the reduced equilibrium real interest rate.
The Governing Council of the ECB decided 
against raising the target inflation rate more 
markedly, however. A marked increase in the 
monetary policy target inflation rate would 
entail   a host of disadvantages.40 For example, 
the problem of inflation- induced bias in relative 
prices would become greater. As a result, the 
steering function of relative prices would be -
come less efficient and could thus lead to inef -
ficient allocation of resources. Higher inflation 
rates also cause other inefficiencies, such as 
higher inflation risk premia in the interest rates 
on longer- term loans, distorting effects in the 
nominal tax and transfer system, or arbitrary re -
distribution of nominal income and wealth.41Furthermore, higher target inflation rates may 
also narrow the newly- acquired interest rate 
policy space once more; given high target infla -
tion, the central bank may have to adjust mon -
etary policy interest rates more aggressively in 
order to stabilise the inflation rate. Higher tar -
get inflation results in the inflation rate being 
shaped by expectations for future inflation to 
an even greater degree, meaning that it is less 
influenced by the current level of economic 
capacity utilisation. The central bank then has 
to generate stronger economic stimulus by 
means of correspondingly marked interest rate 
changes in order to steer inflation in the de -
sired direction through macroeconomic cap -
acity utilisation.42Inflation target 
of 2% provides 
necessary 
balance  
between safety 
margin against 
deflation …
… and costs of 
higher inflation 
rates, such as 
inefficient 
allocation  of 
resources, …… a potential 
narrowing of 
monetary policy 
space …
37 The arguments in favour of a positive inflation buffer 
over the longer term are not just based on the existence of 
a sufficient margin against the lower bound on interest 
rates or possible measurement bias which distorts inflation 
statistics. In particular, alongside a persistent inflation dif -
ferential between the euro area countries, the existence of 
downward nominal price and wage rigidities is also con -
sidered relevant to the justification for an inflation buffer. 
Setting the policy objective at 2% can therefore also be 
seen as a contribution to facilitating any labour market ad -
justments and creating enough scope to facilitate relative 
price adjustment in the monetary union.
38 These are composed of the equilibrium real interest rate 
and the inflation rate targeted by the central bank.
39 The box on pp. 24 ff. shows the relationships between 
the equilibrium real interest rate, the target inflation rate 
and interest rate policy space in a quantitative model.
40 The costs of higher inflation are also likely to rise dispro -
portionately with the level of the target inflation rate. See, 
for example, Ascari and Sbordone (2014).
41 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019c).
42 This relationship can be illustrated using a New Keynes -
ian Phillips curve (NKPC). Based on firms’ optimal pricing 
conditions, it describes the relationship between the infla -
tion rate, the aggregate output gap and inflation expect -
ations. According to the NKPC, average higher inflation 
rates may have the following macroeconomic implications 
(for more information, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018)): 
for one thing, any differences in relative prices between en -
terprises grow larger. The greater shifts in demand associ -
ated with this lead to a reduction in the quantity of goods 
produced by firms. Furthermore, demand becomes less im -
portant for firms’ price setting in relative terms, as they 
now give a stronger weighting to the inflation path when 
they set their prices. Given a higher target inflation rate, 
then, the output gap loses significance as a determinant of 
price developments. That is, with a higher target inflation 
rate, the NKPC becomes flatter and aggregate demand, 
taken in isolation, accordingly becomes less important as a 
determinant of price developments. As a result, the price 
adjustment in the wake of an interest rate hike is less pro -
nounced. In line with this, a cut in interest rates in the 
event of an economic downturn has less of an effect on 
aggregate demand than it would if the inflation rate were 
lower. See also Ascari and Sbordone (2014).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2021  
29

A high target inflation rate might also increase 
the risk of inflation expectations becoming un -
anchored. Should this occur, inflation expect -
ations might deviate from the monetary policy 
target inflation rate over the long term, too, 
making it considerably more difficult to reach 
this target.43 Furthermore, in view of the po -
tential costs of a higher target inflation rate, it 
must be taken into account that the Eurosys -
tem, like other central banks, has expanded its 
toolbox to include unconventional instruments 
that may mitigate the constraints imposed by 
the effective lower bound. However, uncon -
ventional instruments such as asset purchases 
may also potentially have undesirable side 
effects  that must likewise be taken into consid -
eration when setting the target inflation rate.44
Having weighed up the numerous pros and 
cons, the Governing Council of the ECB has 
come to the conclusion that a target inflation 
rate of 2% is appropriate.
The choice to set an inflation target of 2% sim -
ultaneously represents a decision for a point 
target and against a target range for the infla -
tion rate. On the face of it, it seems that a tar -
get range would offer some advantages. In the 
form of an uncertainty band, possibly with a 
focal point in the middle, it would implicitly sig -
nal that the inflation process is not perfectly 
controllable by monetary policy at all times. 
This could help enhance the credibility and 
comprehensibility of monetary policy. In add -
ition, an “indifference range” within which no 
or a weak monetary policy response occurs 
could provide a certain degree of flexibility in 
responding appropriately to unforeseen devel -
opments.
A target range, however, would engender the 
risk of inflation expectations settling at the 
upper or lower bound of the range following a 
series of uniform shocks. This could occur if the 
economic agents had expected either no mon -
etary policy response at all or only a weak mon -
etary policy response within the range. This risk 
would emerge particularly for disinflationary shocks, due to the effective lower bound. Con -
sistent with this is the fact that simulation stud -
ies imply worse inflation stabilisation given a 
target range than given a point target.45 Empir -
ical studies indicate that a point target anchors 
long- run inflation expectations more firmly 
than a target range, at least when the latter is 
perceived as an indifference range.46 Lastly, the 
concept of medium- term orientation also fulfils 
the function of creating monetary policy flexi -
bility (see the section “Medium- term orienta -
tion retained”), with the result that the ECB 
Governing Council continues to deem a target 
range less than ideal in this regard.
Symmetry of the inflation target
As discussed in the section “Why review the 
monetary policy strategy?”, the previous opera -
tionalisation of price stability was asymmetrical. 
This was appropriate to the situation at the 
time of the 2003 strategy review; in view of the 
high inflation rates and predominantly infla -
tionary shocks at the start of monetary union, 
it was particularly important to the ECB Gov -
erning Council to anchor inflation expectations 
at a low level at that time.

ary and deflationary shocks have tended to … or an

43 Economic agents’ inflation expectations play a promin -
ent role for monetary policy because they affect individual 
economic agents’ wage and price setting behaviour, and 
are thus themselves an important determinant of the path 
of inflation. If inflation expectations are not firmly an -
chored, this makes it harder to stabilise the inflation rate. In 
a worst-  case scenario, the central bank would fail to 
achieve its inflation target even in the medium term. A 
higher inflation target may increase the probability of infla -
tion expectations becoming unanchored and, in extreme 
cases, result in them being inconsistent with the central 
bank’s new target even in the long term. For a detailed ex -
planation of this relationship and a risk- benefit analysis of 
aiming either for a higher target inflation rate to act as a 
buffer for the effective lower bound or a lower target infla -
tion rate to prevent inefficiencies, see Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2018).

exert downward pressure on inflation. Against 
this backdrop, the Eurosystem faced the chal -
lenge of ensuring higher inflation rates. The 
asymmetry in the operationalisation of price 
stability increasingly proved to be a hindrance, 
as it potentially signalled a lower degree of 
monetary policy commitment in this context. In 
this respect, the ECB Governing Council’s inten -
tions were not the decisive factor. Rather, the 
perceived asymmetry in terms of the effective 
lower bound particularly heightened the risk of 
persistently lower inflation rates.
For these reasons, the ECB Governing Council 
has now decided to introduce an explicitly sym -
metrical inflation target. This means that nega -
tive and positive deviations of inflation from 
the target are considered to be equally undesir -
able.47 The focus is not on temporary, smaller 
deviations, which are unavoidable in an envir -
onment characterised by myriad and unfore -
seeable events (see the section “Medium- term 
orientation retained”), but rather on larger and 
more persistent deviations from the medium-  
term inflation target of 2%.
With its symmetrical stance, the ECB Governing 
Council aims to anchor inflation expectations 
firmly at the 2% inflation target. This symmetry 
implies that forceful action will be taken in re -
sponse to persistent positive or negative devi -
ations in order to counteract any failure to 
meet the inflation target in the medium term. 
Economic agents can therefore expect that the 
medium- term inflation target will be met. In 
turn, such anchored expectations make it easier  
to reach the inflation target as they result in 
wage and price- setting decisions that are com -
patible with the aim of price stability. Firmly an -
chored inflation expectations remain a signifi -
cant prerequisite for actually reaching the infla -
tion target.
Medium- term orientation retained
Although monetary policy instruments can in -
fluence price developments, they do so with 
time- varying lags. Short- term fluctuations in the inflation rate are therefore beyond the con -
trol of monetary policy. If monetary policy -
makers nonetheless attempted to offset these 
fluctuations, this would likely increase interest 
rate volatility and real economic activity with -
out effectively stabilising inflation.
The medium- term orientation also allows mon -
etary policy to respond flexibly to different 
kinds of shocks. When demand shocks occur, 
inflation and real economic activity move in the 
same direction. Thus a monetary policy re -
sponse that stabilises inflation also stabilises 
production and employment. By contrast, in 
the case of a supply- side shock, inflation and 
real economic activity move in opposite direc -
tions. An example of this is oil price increases. 
They lead to higher costs and thus higher 
prices, but at the same time decrease eco -
nomic activity. In its attempts to stabilise the in -
flation rate, a highly restrictive monetary policy 
response would temporarily trigger an even 
sharper slump in real economic activity.48 It 
may therefore prove wise to initially “look 
through” supply shocks, i.e. to show either a 
weaker monetary policy response or none at 
all, thereby accepting slightly longer deviations 
from the inflation target.49 The medium- term 
orientation therefore allows monetary policy 
stabilisation to come about either more quickly 
or more slowly, depending on the nature of the 
shock.
For these reasons, the ECB Governing Council 
has decided to retain its medium- term orienta -
tion. This preserves the necessary flexibility to 
respond to deviations from the inflation target 
depending on the economic context. The Gov -
erning Council can therefore take all relevant 
factors into consideration when making policy 
decisions aimed at achieving price stability.… but unsuited

48 Due to repercussions for the inflation rate, however, 
strong real economic fluctuations would make it more dif -
ficult for monetary policymakers to ensure price stability.
49 This is particularly true when such supply shocks only 
have a temporary effect and do not cause any second-  
round effects in wage and price negotiations on account of 
firmly anchored inflation expectations.Deutsche Bundesbank

and the higher likelihood of a more frequently 
binding effective lower bound (described in the 
section “Why review the monetary policy strat -
egy?”) present a key challenge for monetary 
policymakers, particularly during periods of 
predominantly disinflationary shocks. If monet -
ary policy is restricted by the effective lower 
bound, it runs out of policy space at precisely 
the moment this would be most crucial in order 
to prevent a potential slide into deflation. By 
contrast, policymakers do, in principle, possess 
unlimited space for raising rates and stabilising 
inflation when positive deviations from the in -
flation target occur.
The effective lower bound thus induces asym -
metry in interest rate policy space. This results, 
if unconventional monetary policy measures 
are abstracted, in an inflation rate that lies sub -
stantially below the inflation target on an aver -
age of a longer period. The effective lower 
bound thus results in what is known as a nega -
tive inflation bias. If inflation expectations be -
come anchored below the inflation target be -
cause of this bias, it becomes significantly more 
difficult for monetary policymakers to ensure 
price stability in terms of the target inflation 
rate. In addition, the lack of interest rate policy 
stabilisation options at the effective lower 
bound increases inflation volatility. These rela -
tionships are examined in more detail in a 
quantitative model on pp. 34 ff.
Unconventional measures at the effective 
lower bound
Since the financial crisis, the ECB Governing 
Council has implemented a series of unconven -
tional monetary policy measures to generate 
upward pressure on inflation in the face of dis -
inflationary shocks.50 So far, these measures 
have proven effective in combating disinflation -
ary pressures.51 In situations where interest 
rates are close to the effective lower bound, they will thus remain a key component of the 
Eurosystem’s toolbox in future, too.
However, high uncertainty remains with regard 
to the exact magnitude of the impact of un -
conventional measures. On account of the rela -
tively recent history of such measures, there are 
currently insufficient data available to reach a 
robust assessment of any kind. Furthermore, 
the magnitude of the measured effects very 
much depends on the policy design and the 
models used for the assessment.52 This is par -
ticularly true for monetary policy purchase pro -
grammes. However, the impact of forward 
guidance on interest rates is also difficult to 
estimate as it is strongly reliant on the credibil -
ity and concrete formulation of the measures.53
The extensive implementation of unconven -
tional measures may also bring about undesir -
able side effects and foster wrong incentives 
for both the private and public sectors, for ex -
ample.54 Although potential side effects can be 
mitigated through suitable policy design, this is 
also likely to reduce the effectiveness of the Effective lower

50 Specifically, these measures included asset purchases, 
negative policy rates, targeted longer- term refinancing op -
erations and forward guidance on interest and purchasing 
policies as well as the reinvestment policy. See Rostagno et 
al. (2021).
51 In the literature on monetary policy, it is widely agreed 
that unconventional measures such as negative interest 
rate policies, asset purchase programmes and forward 
guidance can have a positive impact on the inflation rate, 
in principle. For an overview of the literature, see, for in -
stance, Work stream on the price stability objective (2021), 
Chapter 2, and Altavilla et al. (2021).
52 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).
53 A credible announcement that interest rates are going 
to stay at their effective lower bound tends to increase 
economic agents’ inflation expectations. This reduces real 
interest rates and stimulates the inflation rate by means of 
higher aggregate demand. Given a less credible monetary 
policy, these effects would be correspondingly less pro -
nounced. See Coenen et al. (2021).
54 Generally speaking, an expansionary monetary policy 
that results in low financing costs over a long period of 
time on account of announced asset purchases or interest 
rate forward guidance may have negative incentive effects 
on the indebtedness of euro area countries. The longer 
governments are able to assume that financing conditions 
will remain attractive, the more likely the incentive to im -
plement economic policy reforms and pursue fiscal discip -
line is to decrease, while the vulnerability to a future rise in 
interest rates increases. For more information on this, see 
Röttger and Gerke (2021), who illustrate such a relationship

measures. For example, under the Eurosystem’s 
public sector purchase programme (PSPP), asset 
purchases are subject to certain upper purchas -
ing limits to prevent, amongst other things, 
central banks from becoming the dominant 
creditors of governments. Taken in isolation, 
limits of this kind reduce the efficacy of asset 
purchase programmes by restricting the poten -
tial volume of possible asset purchases and 
hence the degree of monetary policy accom -
modation.55 They are nevertheless necessary in 
order to ensure, inter alia, that the monetary 
policy measures are compatible with the mon -
etary union’s institutional framework and the 
functioning of the affected markets.
For these reasons, individual unconventional 
measures by themselves are likely to be poorly 
suited to completely eliminating the negative 
inflation bias created by the effective lower 
bound. In the context of the Eurosystem’s strat -
egy review, therefore, a range of alternative, 
complementary means of reducing the nega -
tive inflation bias through monetary policy have 
been discussed.
Arguments for and against history- 
dependent monetary policy approaches
History- dependent monetary policy approaches 
represent an additional way of anchoring infla -
tion expectations more firmly at the inflation 
target. In monetary policy practice, past infla -
tion developments do not usually have a bear -
ing on the current monetary policy stance. Ra -
ther, monetary policy focuses on the current 
and expected inflation rates. As some would 
put it, monetary policymakers “let bygones be 
bygones”. In the wake of tightened restrictions 
resulting from the effective lower bound over 
the past few years, however, the focus has in -
creasingly shifted to history- dependent monet -
ary policy approaches.
Such approaches are based on the idea of 
“making up” for past deviations from target 
through future deviations in the opposite direc -
tion. Take average inflation targeting as an il -lustrative example:56 in this case, the target 
variable is the average inflation rate, with the 
central bank setting the time horizon for the 
averaging window. Should the average infla -
tion rate fall below its target, monetary policy 
must temporarily increase the inflation rate 
above target to ensure that the average infla -
tion rate returns to the target. This means that 
monetary policy is intentionally seeking to over -
shoot the inflation rate (or vice versa in the op -
posite scenario).
History- dependent approaches use inflation ex -
pectations as automatic stabilisers: after a 
sustained  period of below- target inflation, 
forward- looking economic agents anticipate 
that the future will bring a temporarily more 
expansionary monetary policy and thus higher 
rates of inflation for as long as it takes for aver -
age inflation to return to the desired target 
level. This reduces the real rate of interest and 
stimulates inflation via expansion of macroeco -
nomic demand (the same applies in reverse 
when inflation overshoots the target for a pro -
longed period of time). The academic literature 
refers to this mechanism as the “expectation 
channel”. At times when the monetary policy 
rates are constrained by their effective lower 
bound, this expectation channel is a particu -
larly valuable way of providing additional mon -
etary policy stimulus.
In analyses based on theoretical models, 
history- dependence performs very well in terms 
of the stabilisation outcomes it produces. 
Among other things, the results show that the 
negative inflation bias is reduced or even elim -
inated entirely – despite taking into account 
the effective lower bound constraint. The box History-

of asset purchase programmes is illustrated in the box on

zon in order to calculate this rate (again, see Nessén and 
Vestin (2005)). For a thorough comparison of inflation tar -
geting and price level targeting, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2010). A model- based comparison of history- dependent 
approaches is carried out in the box on pp. 38 ff.Deutsche Bundesbank

How limits affect the effi   cacy of asset purchase 
programmes 
Central banks use asset purchase pro-
grammes to provide expansionary monet-
ary policy stimulus even when operating at 
the effective lower bound on interest rates. 
In principle, the larger the asset purchase 
programme, the more expansionary its effect 
should be. However, extensive asset pur-
chases also increase the risk of undesirable 
side effects. To give an example, there is the 
possibility that large- scale purchases of gov-
ernment bonds make the central bank a 
dominant creditor of governments. This 
could blur the boundaries between monet-
ary and fi  scal policy, thereby harming the 
independence of monetary policy.1
In order to mitigate these, and other, un-
desirable side effects, asset purchase pro-
grammes are, in practice, subject to built- in 
and/ or legal limits, as is the case with the 
Eurosystem’s public sector purchase pro-
gramme (PSPP).2 Limits of this kind reduce 
the effi   cacy of asset purchase programmes 
if they restrict the level of possible asset 
purchases and hence the degree of monet-
ary policy accommodation. This interaction 
is illustrated in quantitative terms below 
using a model, which reveals the extent to 
which limits could reduce the effi   cacy of 
asset purchases. Possible side effects – and 
thus the reasons for limits – are not part of 
the model analysis below.
In principle, limits can reduce the effi   cacy of 
asset purchases without actually immedi-
ately restricting current purchase pro-
grammes. Limiting the future purchase vol-
ume already suffi   ces. The reason for this is 
that the macroeconomic effect of an asset 
purchase programme materialises as soon 
as it is credibly announced (also referred to 
as a stock effect in this context). This means 
that the expansionary stimulus – assuming that economic agents are forward- looking – 
takes effect even before the central bank 
begins making asset purchases or before it 
has conducted all purchases.3 The size of 
the expansionary effect is thus mainly de-
termined by the expected sum of net pur-
chases, i.e. the expected stock of asset pur-
chases on the central bank’s balance sheet.4
To quantify the effect of possible limits on 
the effi   cacy of asset purchase programmes, 
model simulations were used during the 
strategy review. Dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) models are particularly 
suited to this purpose, as they can depict 
the core mechanisms of asset purchase pro-
grammes. They also allow for counterfac-
tual simulations in order to analyse the 
effect iveness of asset purchase programmes 
with and without limits.5
1 Large purchase volumes can additionally impair the 
smooth functioning of the market as well as price for-
mation in the capital markets. See, for example, 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2016), Questions & Answers at 
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/app/
html/pspp-qa.en.html, or Altavilla et al. (2021).
2 For the PSPP , the Governing Council of the ECB set 
an issue and issuer limit; see Decision (EU) 2015/ 774 of 
the European Central Bank. However, such limits are 
not just applied in the euro area, but also by other cen-
tral banks such as the Bank of England. See Consoli-
dated Market Notice: Asset Purchase Facility: Gilt Pur-
chases – Market Notice 11 June 2019.
3 By contrast, fl  ow effects are the economic effects 
arising exclusively from the purchases actually made. In 
terms of relative effi   cacy, stock effects are regarded as 
the more signifi  cant effect by far. See, for example, 
D’Amico and King (2013) or Sudo and Tanaka (2021).
4 Other relevant factors are the precise path of pur-
chases as the sum of net purchases, a possible re-
investment phase, and the reduction path. For an an-
alysis of the extent to which a reinvestment policy can 
reduce the constraints imposed by limits, see Gerke, 
Kienzler and Scheer (2021).

A state- contingent purchase programme is 
assumed for asset purchases: the more the 
infl  ation rate deviates from its target, the 
higher the level of purchases and the 
greater the expected monetary policy stimu-
lus. The asset purchase programme is for-
mally denoted by:
ˆbt=⇢bˆbt1+IRt=ELB φbˆ⇡t,
where ˆbt is the stock of government bonds 
on the central bank balance sheet and ˆπt is 
the (logarithmic) infl  ation rate, both given 
in terms of deviation from their long- term 
equilibrium.6 The strength of state contin-
gency, depicted by the coeffi   cient /uni03D5b , is 
estimated on the basis of past Eurosystem 
purchases under the PSPP . Furthermore, it is 
assumed that the central bank only con-
ducts asset purchases if its conventional 
monetary policy instrument, the short- term 
interest rate, is constrained by the lower 
bound on interest rates (depicted in the 
above formula by the indicator function 
IRt = ELB ). Once the effective lower bound 
ceases to bind, the central bank gradually 
reduces its balance sheet.7
For the stochastic simulations within the 
above- described model framework, one 
methodological obstacle is capturing the 
various non- linearities. In this model, they 
are the effective lower bound on the short- 
term nominal interest rate, the launching of 
a state- contingent asset purchase pro-
gramme, and any limits of the asset pur-
chase programme.8 One approach to cap-
ture such multiple non- linearities is the 
piecewise linear approach, which was used 
and extended for the underlying simula-
tions.9
Three scenarios are compared, in each of 
which the short- term interest rate is con-
strained by the effective lower bound.10 In 
the fi  rst scenario, the central bank has only the short- term nominal interest rate at its 
disposal. It cannot resort to an asset pur-
chase programme as an additional monet-
ary policy instrument. In the second scen-
ario, the central bank can resort to asset 
purchases to provide further monetary pol-
icy stimulus at the effective lower bound, 
without being constrained by a limit on the 
purchase volume.11 In the third scenario, 
the central bank also has to comply with a 
limit on asset purchases of 25% or alterna-
tively 33% of all outstanding bonds.
The average infl  ation rate in the results for 
each simulation is mapped in the chart on 
p. 36. Three main results emerge. First, the 
effective lower bound on interest rates 
causes a notable negative infl  ation bias if 
the central bank has only the short- term 
nominal interest rate at its disposal. Accord-
6 This kind of process is also used in Bartocci et al. 
(2019) and Coenen et al. (2021). The latter condition 
the purchase programme on a shadow interest rate 
(i.e. on a latent variable) instead of the infl  ation rate.
7 For the sake of simplicity, a reinvestment policy, as 
used by the Eurosystem, is not considered (for inclu-
sion of a reinvestment policy, see Gerke, Kienzler and 
Scheer (2021)). In principle, the operationalisation of 
the purchase process has an impact on the quantita-
tive effects of the purchase programme. In contrast to 
the results below, alternative assumptions such as 
weaker state dependency and swifter balance sheet 
reduction could be made. In this case, the reported 
macroeconomic effects would be reduced accordingly.
8 State contingency has two meanings in this context. 
First, the central bank conducts higher net purchases if 
the infl  ation rate deviates more strongly from its tar-
get. Second, the central bank only conducts these pur-
chases if the monetary policy interest rate is at the ef-
fective lower bound.
9 For the seminal work, see Kulish and Pagan (2017) 
and Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015).
10 To generate the simulations, shocks are randomly 
drawn from the estimated distributions of the exogen-
ous shocks. On this basis, 2,000 simulations with a 
length of 200 periods each are then generated, with 
the fi  rst 100 periods being discarded for the initialisa-
tion. To broadly match the current confi  guration in the 
euro area, the simulations assume an infl  ation target 
of 2%, a long- term equilibrium real interest rate of 
0.5% and an effective lower bound of -0.5%.
11 The level of net purchases and the expected stock 
of bonds on the central bank balance sheet then exclu-
sively stem from two endogenous factors. First, the 
state- contingent net purchases, if the short- term nom-
inal interest rate is constrained by the effective lower 
bound. Second, the stock from past purchases.Deutsche Bundesbank

ingly, the average infl  ation rate settles 
below the infl  ation target. Second, asset 
purchases can reduce the infl  ation bias, but 
not eliminate it completely. Third, asset pur-
chase programmes with limits –  as com-
pared with an unlimited purchase pro-
gramme  – increase the infl  ation bias. In 
other words, they reduce the effi   cacy of 
asset purchase programmes.
The left- hand section of the chart illustrates 
the fi  rst main result. It shows an average in-
fl  ation rate of around 1.5% in scenario 1, 
the one with no asset purchase programme. 
According to the simulations, the effective 
lower bound thus causes the infl  ation rate 
to settle around 50 basis points on average, 
and hence notably, below its target of 2%. 
Taken in isolation, this could jeopardise the 
credibility of the central bank and make it 
harder to anchor long- term infl  ation ex-
pectations. This would further reduce the 
effi   cacy of monetary policy.
When the central bank resorts to unlimited 
asset purchases at the effective lower 
bound (scenario 2), the simulations show a 
marked increase in the average infl  ation 
rate towards the assumed target of 2% 
(middle section). The simulations under-score why asset purchase programmes have 
become an important component of non- 
standard monetary policy measures at the 
effective lower bound. Nonetheless, at just 
over 1.8%, the average infl  ation rate is still 
below the 2% target.
When monetary policy faces limits to its 
asset purchases (scenario 3), it becomes 
more diffi   cult to achieve the infl  ation target 
as compared with a purchase programme 
without limits. The right- hand section of 
the chart illustrates the extent to which a 
limit on the purchase volume of 25% or 
33% reduces the effi   cacy of asset purchase 
programmes. Depending on how tight the 
limit is, the average infl  ation rate falls by 
around 10 to 15 basis points compared 
with an asset purchase programme without 
a limit. Even though the infl  ation rate is 
closer to the 2% target as compared with 
the scenario with no asset purchase pro-
gramme (scenario 1), at just under 1.7% it 
still falls further short of the target than in 
the scenario with unlimited asset purchases 
(scenario 2).
However, limits not only reduce the average 
infl  ation rate, they also increase macroeco-
nomic volatility. For example, compared 
with a scenario without a limit, infl  ation 
rate volatility rises by 25% to 40%. It in-
creases more strongly given a limit of 25% 
than for a limit of 33%.12
In summary, the following can be con-
cluded from the illustrative simulations: the 
effective lower bound on interest rates con-
12 Similar results can also be found in simulations of 
the effect of limits in Work stream on the price stabil-
ity objective (2021) or Mazelis et al. (2021). In the lat-
ter paper, however, the state dependency of the asset 
purchase programmes was implemented via a model- 
endogenous shadow interest rate (latent variable). 
Here, even a limit of 50% leads to a decline in the 
average infl  ation rate of up to 5 basis points and an in-
crease in volatility of around 20% compared with an 
unlimited asset purchase programme.Average inflation rates in different

on pp. 38 ff. presents and explains some model 
results of this kind.57
However, these benefits are only fully realised if 
history- dependent approaches are credible and 
well understood by economic agents and if 
those economic agents form forward- looking 
expectations to a sufficient degree.58 Other -
wise, they will adjust their adjustment expect -
ations only partially or not at all. This, in turn, 
prevents the expectation channel from exerting 
its full stabilising effect, and the theoretical 
benefits of history- dependence diminish.59 The 
box on pp. 44 f. illustrates in a model- theoretic 
context how a specific form of bounded ration -
ality can considerably impair the stabilisation 
capacity of history- dependent approaches.60
There is considerable uncertainty surrounding 
how economic agents actually form their ex -
pectations and how potent the effect of the 
expectation channel could be. For example, in -
fluences of a more backward- looking nature may be a dominant force in the formation of 
expectations if past personal experiences with 
varyingly high rates of inflation play an import -
ant role for inflation expectations.61 Empirical … provided they

forward- looking 
mannerstrains the central bank in achieving the in-
fl  ation target. Even using asset purchase 
programmes without limits does not neces-
sarily suffi   ce to achieve the infl  ation target if 
the empirically estimated strength of the 
state dependency of the purchase pro-
gramme matches that of the PSPP . This is all 
the more true when limits restrict the pos-
sible purchase volume. For this reason, the 
Governing Council of the ECB decided on a 
comprehensive package of monetary policy 
measures at the effective lower bound: as 
part of the new strategy, the Eurosystem 
has agreed to continue providing expan-
sionary stimulus at the effective lower 
bound using additional instruments such as 
forward guidance on interest rates and an 
asymmetric response function.13
13 For the impact of unconventional measures on the 
infl  ation rate, see Altavilla et al. (2021). The use of mul-
tiple instruments can also create additional synergy ef-
fects, e.g. when asset purchases are conducted in par-
allel to forward guidance on interest rates. For more 
on this, see also Gerke et al. (2020).
57 For a harmonised model analysis looking at history-  
dependent approaches and including a variety of models 
used in the Eurosystem, see Work stream on the price sta -
bility objective (2021), Chapter 4.
58 Simply put, this means that economic agents are cap -
able of virtually unrestrictedly forming expectations about 
potential events far in the future. Only then can monetary 
policy measures that are announced today but will not be 
implemented until later on have a positive impact on cur -
rent economic decisions.
59 See Work stream on the price stability objective (2021). 
In the case of strong forms of history- dependent ap -
proaches, like price level targeting, the stabilisation effect is 
so potent that even with hybrid expectations – a mixture of 
rational and backward- looking expectations – no negative 
inflation bias arises. Having said that, the degree of devi -
ation from rational expectations in these simulations is 
small for technical reasons. Larger deviations from rational 
expectations or even fully backward- looking expectations 
could alter the results.
60 There is still no consensus in the academic literature as 
to the extent to which the ideal-  typical preconditions for 
high effectiveness of history-  dependent strategies actually 
need to be met.

Potential stabilisation effects of history- dependent 
monetary  policy approaches – insights from quantitative 
model analyses
To the vast majority of central banks, ensur-
ing price stability means stabilising future 
infl  ation at the target value. The prime ex-
ample of such a monetary policy approach 
is infl  ation targeting (IT).1 This approach has 
helped many economies bring down infl  a-
tion rates which were, at times, running 
high in the 1980s and 1990s. In an environ-
ment of low infl  ation rates and a falling 
equilibrium real interest rate, however, this 
approach poses challenges to monetary 
policy owing to the effective lower bound 
on nominal interest rates.2
In practice, central banks at the effective 
lower bound have attempted to compen-
sate for the lack of space for further interest 
rate cuts by means of unconventional meas-
ures. However, owing not least to potential 
undesirable side effects of such measures, 
approaches above and beyond forward- 
looking infl  ation targeting are being dis-
cussed.3 The focus is primarily on history- 
dependent approaches (also referred to as 
“make- up” approaches), which – according 
to monetary policy theory – can have ad-
vantages over conventional infl  ation target-
ing, especially in a low interest rate environ-
ment. This discussion is not purely academic 
in nature; in the aftermath of its strategy re-
view, the US Federal Reserve switched to a 
version of average infl  ation targeting (AIT). 
The most salient feature of such an ap-
proach is that the monetary policy target is 
based on an average infl  ation rate – in con-
trast to approaches based on conventional 
infl  ation targeting. A certain monetary pol-
icy target (e.g. 2%) is set here and the aver-
age is formed over a period in the past to 
be defi  ned. The potential advantage of 
credible and well- understood history- dependent approaches such as AIT – or its 
close relative, price level targeting (PLT) – 
lies in stabilising infl  ation automatically by 
managing private sector expectations.4
Central banks pursuing AIT commit, if the 
average infl  ation rate deviates negatively 
(positively) from the target, to aiming for a 
future infl  ation rate that is above (below) 
the average infl  ation target. On condition 
that the central bank’s commitment is 
viewed as credible, the anticipated future 
monetary policy response, through the ex-
pectations channel, contributes to steering 
future infl  ation in the right direction in the 
present.5 In this manner, the infl  ation rate is 
“automatically” stabilised by expected fu-
ture actions, which lessens the central 
bank’s need for forceful intervention. This, 
in turn, promotes a more effective stabilisa-
tion of infl  ation through corresponding ef-
fects on the short- term real interest rate.
1 Under this approach, monetary policymakers com-
mit, amongst other things, to meeting a numerical in-
fl  ation target that is explicitly communicated to the 
public and to transparently explaining the measures 
designed to assure that this target is met. Although  
the infl  ation target is mostly adopted as a point target, 
it can also, in principle, be defi  ned as a target range. 
This point is discussed in the main article. See also Ehr-
mann (2021).

3 This box solely addresses the extent to which an 
alter native approach may enhance the effectiveness of 
monetary policy. Unconventional monetary policy is 
not discussed any further below. See pp.  34 ff. for 
more on the role of asset purchases at the effective 
lower bound.
4 The relationship between PLT and AIT is discussed in 
footnote 56 in the main text.
5 An average infl  ation rate below target triggers ex-
pectations of monetary policy expansion in the future. 
This, in turn, leads to an increase in future economic 
activity and infl  ation. Higher infl  ation expectations 
then push down the (expected) real interest rate in the 
previous periods, increasing aggregate demand and in-
fl  ation in those periods. The reverse occurs if the aver-
age infl  ation rate is above target.Deutsche Bundesbank

The automatic stabilisation property is help-
ful particularly when the effective lower 
bound prevents a stronger nominal interest 
rate response given a negative deviation 
from target. In this case, the central bank’s 
commitment to “make up” the negative de-
viation from target by means of a more ex-
pansionary future policy allows it to in-
crease current infl  ation expectations and 
step up the monetary expansion in the 
present through the consequent reduction 
in the real interest rate, despite the exist-
ence of a binding effective lower bound.
Alongside the aforementioned benefi  ts, 
though, history- dependent approaches also 
have potential downsides. Chief among 
them is the potential amplifi  cation of mon-
etary policy confl  icts which already occur in 
the case of IT in connection with supply- 
side shocks. If, for example, under a regime 
of AIT, the infl  ation rate is above target 
owing to an infl  ationary supply- side shock 
(e.g. a positive oil price shock), the central 
bank is compelled to counteract this price 
movement by tightening monetary policy in 
the future. Since price developments are 
driven to a large extent by wage dynamics, 
aggregate activity, which is already being 
dampened by the supply- side shock, would 
have to be curbed further given sticky 
wages in order to achieve the desired im-
pact on infl  ation. The long- run stabilisation 
of infl  ation under history- dependent ap-
proaches can therefore be associated with 
considerable losses in terms of macroeco-
nomic stabilisation.6 The scope of the afore-
mentioned pros and cons of history- 
dependent approaches depends, amongst 
other things, on the shocks to which an 
economy is exposed and how they infl  u-
ence macroeconomic dynamics.7 Ultim-
ately, the net benefi  ts can only be assessed 
quantitatively using counterfactual model 
analyses.This box will summarise the results of a 
model- based comparison of various monet-
ary policy approaches below, using two 
New Keynesian models.8 They differ in 
terms of the macroeconomic importance of 
household heterogeneity, which has impli-
cations for the effectiveness of history- 
dependent monetary policy. In the fi  rst dy-
namic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) 
model, the household sector is modelled by 
a “representative household”.9 Models of 
this type, referred to below as representa-
tive agent New Keynesian (RANK) models, 
are currently the dominant type in the aca-
demic literature and monetary policy prac-
tice. However, this category of models pos-
sesses numerous weaknesses that could 
also be relevant for an assessment of history- 
dependent monetary policy. Above all, 
households’ consumption and saving – com-
pared with empirical estimates – is exces-
sively sensitive to changes in interest rates, 
which means that monetary policy causes 
very strong direct consumption effects via 
the interest rate channel. This is also true 
for expected future interest rate changes; 
6 See the main article for more on additional chal-
lenges in connection with history- dependent ap-
proaches.
7 Non- rational expectations formation can impact 
considerably on, for instance, the cost- benefi  t ratio of 
history- dependent approaches; see pp. 44 f.
8 Both models are DSGE models with sticky goods 
prices and wages. They contain, moreover, demand- 
side shocks which exacerbate the problems associated 
with the effective lower bound as well as supply- side 
disruptions which could potentially be problematic for 
history- dependent approaches given wage stickiness. 
Both models therefore capture key aspects which are 
of relevance to an assessment of history- dependent 
approaches in monetary policy. See Dobrew, Gerke, 
Giesen and Röttger (2021) for details of the model.
9 Differences between households, especially concern-
ing labour income and wealth, are omitted here or do 
not affect macroeconomic developments or the mon-
etary transmission process. A possible rationale for a 
representative household can be the assumption of 
complete fi  nancial markets. Under this assumption, 
households can negotiate fi  nancial contracts amongst 
each other which make idiosyncratic risks perfectly in-
surable. It can be shown for this case that inequalities 
between households do not affect macroeconomic 
variables. See, for example, Ljungqvist and Sargent 
(2018).Deutsche Bundesbank

consequently, RANK models are typically 
subject to the “forward guidance puzzle”, 
which means that the effects of interest 
rate forward guidance are unrealistically 
strong.10 Since history- dependent ap-
proaches make up for negative deviations 
of infl  ation from target during a phase at 
the effective lower bound through future 
positive deviations, i.e. accordingly lower 
interest rates, the interest rate channel gen-
erally has an unrealistically large impact in 
RANK models and thus potentially over-
states the effects of history- dependent ap-
proaches.
The second DSGE model, hereinafter re-
ferred to as the heterogeneous agent New 
Keynesian (HANK) model, refl  ects house-
holds’ behaviour more realistically, giving 
household heterogeneity in this model a 
relevant macroeconomic role.11 The rela-
tionship between economic heterogeneity 
and monetary policy is mutual. On the one 
hand, the distribution of income and wealth 
affects how monetary policy impacts on 
macroeconomic variables. When analysing 
history- dependent monetary policy, it is 
particularly that share of households which cannot borrow as much as they wish owing 
to credit constraints which matters. The ex-
istence of such households tends to weaken 
the potential of history- dependent monet-
ary policy. In particular, household con-
sumption is less sensitive to expected future 
changes in interest rates.12 On the other 
hand, the wealth distribution in the model 
is itself also a function of monetary policy. 
Since households’ savings and debt are 
nominal in the model, a tighter monetary 
policy, for instance, will weigh more heavily 
10 See Dobrew, Gerke, Giesen and Röttger (2021) and 
the references contained therein.
11 Unlike in the RANK model, fi  nancial markets in 
HANK models are incomplete, i.e. households are sub-
ject to uninsurable idiosyncratic risks. In conjunction 
with the existence of credit constraints, this implies 
that a household’s individual income and wealth in-
form its decisions on consumption and saving. In this 
case, macroeconomic variables accordingly refl  ect 
wealth and income inequality.
12 The larger the share of credit- constrained house-
holds, the less strongly the average household tends to 
increase its consumption if it expects higher future in-
come or a lower real interest rate. Given a plausible 
model specifi  cation, the expectations channel in the 
model thereby tends to be weakened relative to the 
RANK model (see Hagedorn et al. (2019)). In the HANK 
model, credit constraints also give rise to precautionary 
saving, impacting on the equilibrium real interest rate 
and the transmission of monetary policy. Neither of 
these aspects is captured in the RANK model.Simulation results for various interest rate rules based on RANK/HANK models

on borrowers owing to the dampening 
effect  on inﬂ  ation. This is likely to affect, 
above all, credit- constrained borrowers. If 
this group is suﬃ   ciently large, aggregate 
consumer demand can additionally be 
lowered due to the high propensity of this 
group to consume. Such heterogeneities 
can therefore also amplify a history- 
dependent monetary policy, which means 
that it is not clear a priori whether, and if 
so, to what extent, a history- dependent ap-
proach in the HANK model is less effective 
relative to the RANK model.13
The monetary policy approaches being 
looked at here are IT, AIT and PLT. They are 
captured in both models by interest rate 
rules which determine the key monetary 
policy interest rate as a function of the inﬂ  a-
tion rate and the output gap. In AIT and 
PLT, monetary policy additionally responds 
to the average inﬂ  ation rate and the price 
level, respectively. For AIT, scenarios with 
4-year and 8-year averaging are simulated. 
The extent to which the effective lower 
bound constrains monetary policy in the 
models depends in large part on the dis-
tance between the average nominal inter-
est rate and the effective lower bound.14 
The table on p. 40 shows the simulation re-
sults on the basis of selected statistics. The 
results do not show any qualitative differ-
ences between the models and are quanti-
tatively similar. The aforementioned trans-
mission channels contained in the HANK 
model, as opposed to the RANK model, 
therefore more or less cancel each other 
out.15 Three general observations can be 
made.
– First: history- dependent monetary policy 
rules decrease macroeconomic volatility. 
The more history- dependent a monetary 
policy rule is, the more effectively mon-
etary policy is able to stabilise inﬂ  ation 
and real economic activity. Under AIT with 4- year averaging, for instance, the 
standard deviation of the inﬂ  ation rate is 
just under 40% lower than under IT for 
both models. The standard deviation of 
the output gap – as a measure of real 
economic activity – is, in this case, ap-
proximately 9% lower for the RANK 
model and roughly 17% lower for the 
HANK model. In the case of PLT, which is 
even more history- dependent, inﬂ  ation 
volatility decreases by just under 45% for 
both models, whereas the volatility of 
the output gap falls by 12% (RANK) or 
21% (HANK). These comparisons illus-
trate the fact that the additional gains in 
stabilisation decrease in line with the 
history- dependence of monetary policy. 
Thus, changing from IT to AIT with 4- 
year averaging improves macroeconomic 
stabilisation more substantially than in-
creasing the time window from 4- year to 
8- year averaging.
– Second: the more history- dependent the 
rule, the lower the probability of monet-
ary policy being constrained by the ef-
fective lower bound. This observation 
can be made in light of the frequency at 
13 See Ferrante and Paustian (2019) for more about 
the redistributive effects between savers and borrow-
ers in a structurally similar HANK model and the impli-
cations for forward guidance on interest rates. Since 
these effects tend to make forward guidance more ef-
fective, it stands to reason that they will enhance the 
effect of history- dependent monetary policy, which 
likewise operates through the expectations channel, as 
well.
14 The model parameters which are decisive for the 
distance are chosen to realistically capture the current 
situation in the euro area. This implies an inﬂ  ation tar-
get of 2%, a steady- state real interest rate level of 
0.5% and an effective lower bound of -0.5%. The box 
beginning on p. 24 illustrates the impact of this dis-
tance, which is a positive function of the inﬂ  ation tar-
get and steady- state real interest rate, on the problem 
of the effective lower bound.
15 The two models abstract from ﬁ  scal policy, which in 
the HANK model would lead to additional distribu-
tional effects that may alter the transmission of monet-
ary policy relative to the RANK model. The implications 
for history- dependent monetary policy are impossible 
to identify directly; this is ultimately another quantita-
tive issue.Deutsche Bundesbank

which the respective model economy is 
located at the effective lower bound for 
a given interest rate rule. For both 
models, the number of periods at the 
effect ive lower bound falls monotonic-
ally in line with the history- dependence 
of the monetary policy approach. In the 
process, this share falls by nearly one- 
half under PLT compared to IT and de-
clines in the RANK (HANK) model from 
22% (19%) to 13% (10%). As is the case 
for macroeconomic stabilisation, an 
increase  in history- dependence is asso-
ciated with smaller additional effects. 
This comes as no surprise, since the re-
duced incidence of a binding effective 
lower bound is a major factor in the im-
proved stabilisation properties of history- 
dependent approaches.
– Third: the more history- dependent mon-
etary policy is, the more closely the infl  a-
tion rate converges towards target. More 
history- dependent monetary policy ap-
proaches temper the problem of the ef-
fective lower bound, thereby also im-
proving monetary policy’s ability to 
achieve the infl  ation target (of 2%). 
Whereas under IT the infl  ation rate, at 
1.81% in the RANK model and 1.72% in 
the HANK model, is, on average, well 
below target, PLT enables the infl  ation 
target to be hit without any downside 
bias. Again, the additional improvements 
decline the more history- dependent 
monetary policy is, though AIT with a 
4-year averaging time window already 
pushes the exchange rate exceptionally 
close to target.16
In summary, history- dependent approaches 
have the potential to establish more effect-
ive macroeconomic stabilisation, especially 
at the effective lower bound. This outcome 
can be derived both from DSGE models 
with a representative household and in models with household heterogeneity. In 
the latter, although the more realistic mod-
elling of consumption and saving tempers 
the impact of expected future interest rate 
changes, history- dependent strategies can 
mitigate the negative infl  uence of a binding 
effective lower bound under these condi-
tions, too. However, policymakers should 
take into account the fact that market par-
ticipants do not necessarily form rational 
expectations, which could dampen the sta-
bilising impact of history- dependent ap-
proaches (see the main text and the box on 
pp. 44 f.)17
16 The smaller incidence of a binding effective lower 
bound also reduces the average strength of recessions, 
which is refl  ected in the higher mean output gap.

studies examining whether an average inflation 
targeting regime is fundamentally understood 
by the public at large reach different conclu -
sions.62 Furthermore, it is uncertain whether 
higher inflation expectations actually lead to in -
creased spending and investment, as is often 
assumed in theory. Recent study results sug -
gest, for example, that households may well 
associate higher inflation expectations with a 
pessimistic outlook on economic conditions.63 
The intended real interest rate effect of higher 
inflation expectations would then be counter -
acted by commensurately more cautious 
spending behaviour and thus a higher propen -
sity to save.
In any case, a history- dependent approach 
would therefore have to be carefully communi -
cated. Defining and communicating as pre -
cisely as possible the specifics of how such an 
approach is configured would lead to a better 
understanding and therefore raise its effective -
ness. Among other things, details of such a 
communication include the length of the past 
period relevant in terms of making up for devi -
ations from target and the duration and magni -
tude of future undershoots and overshoots. 
However, when it comes to monetary policy 
practice, there is a certain tension with the de -
sire for policymakers to flexibly react to unfore -
seen circumstances. For example, if monetary 
policymakers refrained from adopting an ex -
pansionary stance in response to a recession 
because there had previously been a period of 
above-  target inflation, they might find them -
selves in the difficult situation of having to jus -
tify their choices. Such concerns can be dealt 
with by appropriate configuration of the policy, 
for example stipulating that deviations will only 
be made up in the long term or that only nega -
tive deviations from target will be responded 
to. However, by the same token, designs of this 
kind increase complexity and make it harder to 
understand and communicate the history-  
dependent approach.
In addition, the current environment of low in -
flation rates and persistently expansionary monetary policy measures constitutes a major 
hurdle towards switching to a history-dependent 
approach. Monetary policy rates have been 
fluctuating at or close to the effective lower 
bound for some years now. According to the 
current interest rate forward guidance they are 
set to remain there for a long time to come.64 
In such a setting it is questionable whether the 
promise of an overshoot, which would possibly 
require further expansionary measures, would 
be sufficiently effective.65
Having weighed up all of the pros and cons, 
the Governing Council decided against a 
history- dependent approach to monetary pol -
icy.
Asymmetric monetary policy response to 
deviations from the inflation target
An asymmetric monetary policy response to 
deviations from the inflation target represents 
another way of mitigating the constraints im -
posed by the effective lower bound. In this ap -
proach, monetary policy reacts more forcefully 
to negative deviations from the inflation target 
than to positive ones. The aim is to offset the 
asymmetry created by the effective lower 
bound by introducing an “opposing” asym -
metry in the strength of monetary policy re -
sponse to deviations from the inflation target. 
This is designed to eliminate any negative infla -
tion bias stemming from the asymmetry of the 
monetary policy space arising from the lower 
bound.66Moreover,

62 While Coibion et al. (2020) find in their survey- based 
study that US households by and large do not understand 
the concept of average inflation targeting, Hoffmann et al. 
(2021) come to a different conclusion for Germany.

65 The asset purchase programmes primarily exert their ex -
pansionary effect via the long- term interest rates. As ex -
plained above, these programmes are subject to certain 
constraints, meaning that they cannot be expanded infin -
itely. On top of this, consideration needs to be given to any 
undesirable side effects which may arise over time.
66 In simplified terms, this kind of asymmetric approach 
can be modelled in the form of an asymmetric instrument 
rule where the risk coefficient for deviations to the down -
side is bigger than that for inflation rate deviations of the 
same magnitude to the upside.Deutsche Bundesbank

Limited effectiveness of history- dependent approaches 
under bounded rational expectations
For history- dependent monetary policy ap-
proaches to be able to generate welfare- 
enhancing effects via the expectations 
channel, economic agents must act with a 
suffi   cient degree of foresight. This means 
that economic agents need to be able to 
freely form expectations of future events. 
Only then can monetary policy measures 
that are announced today but implemented 
in the future have a positive impact on eco-
nomic agents’ current economic decisions.1 
Otherwise such approaches can even re-
duce welfare. They then do not generate 
stabilising effects by relying on forward- 
looking decisions, but instead lead to 
greater macroeconomic volatility through 
policy measures that are oriented to the 
past.
The extent to which history- dependent ap-
proaches rely on the expectations forma-
tion of economic agents is illustrated below 
on the basis of model simulations. The an-
alysis uses a New Keynesian model with 
sticky prices and wages and bounded ra-
tional expectations.2 Monetary policy is oc-
casionally constrained by an effective lower 
bound on interest rates caused by either 
supply or demand shocks.
Bounded rationality is modelled using the 
cognitive discounting approach developed 
by Gabaix (2020).3 Under this approach, 
economic agents are partially myopic in 
their reaction to future events. They antici-
pate their effects only imperfectly even if 
they already have full knowledge of their 
occurrence. Therefore, they only partially 
react to known future events. At the same 
time, they are fully aware of the long- term 
macroeconomic relationships and thus also 
of the long- term economic equilibrium that 
arises in the absence of shocks.4When agents form their expectations in a 
predominantly rational manner, history- 
dependent approaches are welfare- 
enhancing (see the box on p. 38). The chart 
on p. 45 illustrates this fi  nding, comparing 
the welfare losses5 of various monetary pol-
icy rules. If cognitive discounting is low 
(M/uni00A0> 0.8, M = 1 corresponds to the as-
sumption of rational expectations), i.e. 
when economic agents show a high degree 
of foresight, history- dependent policy rules 
are associated with the smallest welfare 
losses arising from macroeconomic fl  uctu-
ations. These rules can then effectively sta-
bilise macroeconomic developments via the 
1 Additional requirements are that such measures are 
credible and understood. Furthermore, economic 
agents must not otherwise be restricted in their 
decision- making, e.g. by credit constraints. See the 
section entitled “Arguments for and against history- 
dependent monetary policy approaches” on pp. 33 ff.
2 Within the model, households, fi  rms and unions 
have the same bounded rational expectations. The 
central bank is assumed to maintain rational expect-
ations. For further details, see Dobrew, Gerke, Kienzler 
and Schwemmer (2021).
3 Currently, most macroeconomic models are based 
on the assumption of rational expectations. Divergent, 
older approaches often formalise non- rational expect-
ations by incorporating backward- looking components 
into the expectation formation process or via ad hoc 
rules of thumb which economic agents mechanically 
follow. In recent years, a newer body of literature has 
increasingly provided explicit microfoundations for 
non- rational expectations. This includes, inter alia, ap-
proaches in which economic agents learn (Evans and 
Honkapohja (2001)), have fi  nite planning horizons 
(García- Schmidt and Woodford (2019), Woodford 
(2019)) or lack common knowledge with regard to 
macroeconomic shocks (Angeletos and Lian (2018)).
4 In mathematical terms, bounded rational expect-
ations /u1D53C.ststBR of an economic variable xt are modelled as 
a weighted average of rational expectations /u1D53C.stst and the 
long- term equilibrium   /uni0304x   of this variable, i.e. 
/u1D53C.ststBR = M /u1D53C.stst{xt} + (1 – M ) /uni0304x. M denotes the degree of 
rationality, whereby M = 1 is synonymous with rational 
expectations and a lower M  implies greater cognitive 
discounting.
5 Welfare loss is measured as the representative con-
sumer’s utility loss resulting from deviations from the 
effi   cient allocation. Following the behavioural eco-
nomics literature, it is assumed that consumers evalu-
ate these utility losses objectively, i.e. under rational 
expectations, even if they tend to make economic de-
cisions myopically.Deutsche Bundesbank

expectations channel as explained in the 
main article – even if monetary policy is 
constrained by the effective lower bound. 
This particularly applies to price level target-
ing (PLT) but is also the case for average in-
fl  ation targeting (AIT).6
However, history- dependent approaches 
are welfare- reducing if economic agents 
tend to be myopic. A higher degree of cog-
nitive discounting (M < 0.8) reverses the 
ranking of the various monetary policy 
rules. Infl  ation targeting (IT) now leads to 
the smallest welfare losses. By contrast, 
price level targeting is detrimental in the 
case of both supply and demand shocks.
Higher cognitive discounting weakens the 
expectations channel and therefore leads to 
larger welfare losses under history- 
dependent approaches.7 The aim of these 
approaches is for infl  ation to overshoot its 
target following a low interest rate period. 
This in turn is supposed to have a positive 
impact on current infl  ation via the expect-
ations channel. A high degree of discount-
ing signifi  cantly reduces these positive ex-
pectational effects.8 At the same time, the 
overshooting of infl  ation after a low inter-
est rate period leads to greater fl  uctuations 
in the real economy and thus to greater 
volatility. With higher cognitive discounting 
the disadvantages of a history- dependent 
approach therefore outweigh the advan-
tages.96 For an explanation of PLT and AIT, see the section 
entitled “Arguments for and against history- dependent 
monetary policy approaches” on pp. 33 ff. and foot-
note 59 in the main article.
7 In a New Keynesian model with sticky prices and 
wages, a supply shock would always lead to welfare 
losses because a trade- off arises between stabilising in-
fl  ation and stabilising output.
8 In addition, recessions induced by the effective lower 
bound are less pronounced under higher discounting. 
Through the weakened expectations channel, eco-
nomic agents are less infl  uenced by future recessions 
when making current decisions. Bounded rationality 
therefore not only reduces the positive effects them-
selves, but also the scope for potential positive effects.
9 Thus far, empirical estimates of the discounting fac-
tor are sparse and inconsistent, and therefore uncer-
tain. In addition, structural estimates also depend on 
the specifi  c model assumptions. They vary between 
M = 0.4 and M = 0.95 , e.g. in Illabaca et al. (2020).Comparison of monetary policy rules

To understand how this concept works, it is 
helpful first to abstract from the effective lower 
bound and clarify the effect of the asymmetric 
reaction function in isolation. If monetary pol -
icy reacts more forcefully to negative deviations 
from the inflation target than to positive ones, 
the inflation rate will be stabilised more strongly 
at its target level after disinflationary shocks 
than after inflationary shocks. If disinflationary 
and inflationary shocks occur with the same 
frequency and strength, this would mean that, 
over the long- term average, an inflation rate 
above target would set in. If the effective lower 
bound is occasionally binding and hence pro -
duces negative inflation bias by itself, an asym -
metric reaction function can therefore achieve 
the inflation target in the long run.67 However, 
the right calibration is important here: if the re -
action function is too asymmetric, it can ultim -
ately even lead to positive inflation bias despite 
the constraints of the effective lower bound.
From the perspective of monetary policy prac -
tice, asymmetric approaches offer a few advan -
tages over history- dependent approaches. First, 
their efficacy does not primarily depend on the 
expectation channel and the associated uncer -
tainties. Second, monetary policy retains a 
greater degree of flexibility than if it ties itself 
to the promise of an overshoot.
As the outcome of its strategy review, the ECB 
Governing Council communicated a form of 
asymmetric reaction function. It implies that, in 
the event of strongly negative inflation shocks, 
the monetary policy instruments are to be de -
ployed particularly forcefully. If the policy rates 
are close to the effective lower bound, the 
Governing Council can also maintain its de -
ployment of instruments more persistently. This 
is designed to safeguard on two fronts. First, 
the approach signals that persistent negative 
deviations from the inflation target will be 
taken equally as seriously as positive ones. In 
this regard, the effective lower bound necessi -
tates a more forceful or persistent monetary 
policy response to negative shocks. Second, it 
should anchor inflation expectations firmly to the inflation target, which is a crucial precondi -
tion for achieving the monetary policy object -
ive.
A more forceful or persistent deployment of 
monetary policy instruments in response to 
negative shocks has the potential to result in a 
transitory period in which the inflation rate is 
moderately above target. However, this is not 
to be confused with approving of or actually ac -
tively aiming for an overshoot. That is not how 
the Eurosystem’s new monetary policy strategy 
is designed. Rather, an inflation rate that might 
be moderately above target for a transitory 
period can be the result of the inability of mon -
etary policy to fine- tune the inflation rate.

Integrated analytical framework for 
monetary  policy decisions
As part of its strategy review, the Governing 
Council of the ECB decided to replace its previ -
ous two- pillar strategy with an integrated ana -
lytical framework. This is composed of two 
interdependent analyses: the “economic analy -
sis” and the “monetary and financial analy -
sis”.68 The past 15 years have shown that link -
ages between economic, monetary and finan -
cial developments have played a key role in 
price stability. This means that the economic 
analysis and monetary analysis do not consti -
tute two separate ways of looking at inflation.Stronger 
response to 
negative devi -
ations from the 
inflation target 
can potentially 
even out the 
asymmetry of 
the effective 
lower bound
More flexible 
and less 
dependent on 
the expectation 
channel
New strategy 
thus allows for 
more forceful 
and persistent 
monetary policy

negative shocksThis may imply 
positive, tempor -
ary, smaller 
deviations from

an active intent 
to overshoot

The ECB Governing Council also broadened the 
scope of the monetary analysis in its previous 
form to encompass monetary and financial an -
alysis. In doing so, it is following analytical 
practice which has evolved over the past years 
and no longer concentrates primarily on money 
supply and credit aggregates but is instead in -
formed by a much broader dataset. This in -
cludes, in particular, trends in the money, bond 
and stock markets as well as inflation expect -
ations. Data on the resilience of the banking 
system, on lending by non- banks, and on the 
financing conditions of households and non-  
financial corporations are important as well.
When making monetary policy decisions, the 
ECB Governing Council weighs up the results 
from both streams of analysis in a comprehen -
sive and situation- based manner. This involves 
reviewing the proportionality and potential side 
effects of its policy. However, in future there 
will no longer be a formal cross- check of the 
information from the two streams. This is why 
the “monetary policy statement”, which in July 
replaced the introductory statement given at 
the press conference following the ECB Gov -
erning Council’s monetary policy meetings, no 
longer specifically refers to cross-  checking. In -
stead, the statement has been streamlined. Its 
focus now lies on those results of the eco -
nomic analysis as well as of the monetary and 
financial analysis which were decisive in form -
ing the assessment of inflation risks at the point 
in question.
Economic analysis
The economic analysis looks at developments 
in real terms and nominal terms. The goal is to 
obtain a comprehensive idea of where prices 
may be heading and the risks around these de -
velopments. In the years since the last strategy 
review in 2003, two aspects in particular have 
emerged to motivate a fundamental review of 
the economic analysis.
First, the Eurosystem’s economy –  like the 
global economy as a whole – has undergone profound structural change. Globalisation, 
demographic ageing, digitalisation, climate 
change and slowing technological progress 
have had an impact on potential growth, the 
natural rate of interest69 and the inflation pro -
cess. As a consequence, these structural trends 
need to be taken into account in the prepar -
ation of monetary policy decisions. In future, 
they and their effects on the inflation rate will 
therefore be analysed regularly and to an even 
greater extent than previously.
Second, the Eurosystem’s quarterly macroeco -
nomic projections have become more and 
more important in the monetary policy 
decision- making process over time. They have 
evolved into the central instrument for structur -
ing and summarising the wealth of economic 
data and information in a consistent fashion. 
Forming the key foundation for gauging short 
to medium- term fluctuations in economic and 
price developments around their long- term 
trend, they help the ECB Governing Council to 
detect any medium- term risks to price stability. 
Significant improvements in data sources, 
along with new econometric methods and 
model approaches, have propelled the projec -
tions into greater prominence. Furthermore, 
constant advances in IT have enabled the pro -
cessing of larger data volumes and the use of 
more complex models requiring greater com -
putational effort.
Future work to refine the economic analysis will 
continue to focus on tapping new information 
sources and using innovative methods for inter -
preting them. High- frequency data make it 
possible to assess the repercussions of abrupt 
shocks more quickly, for example. This was al -
ready visible during the COVID-  19 crisis. An -
other goal is to use surveys and the interpret -
ation of big data to obtain deeper insights into 
economic relationships and structures. Recog -
nising the nature of shocks that hit the euro 
area economy is of particular importance for Broadening of

the economic analysis. As discussed above, the 
monetary policy implications of supply- side 
shocks are different to those of demand shocks, 
for example. Another focal point lies in risk as -
sessment, especially in terms of the medium-  
term outlook. Asymmetric risk distributions and 
the degree of uncertainty are highly relevant 
factors for monetary policymakers. Finally, the 
models used in the economic analysis need to 
be honed and augmented by new approaches 
in a targeted way, for example in respect of the 
effects of climate change (see the box on 
pp.  49 ff.). The past few years have demon -
strated how crucial it is to pay greater attention 
to heterogeneities in the euro area, macro-  
financial interactions and non- linear relation -
ships, too.
Monetary and financial analysis
The monetary analysis which existed up to this 
point will be retained and augmented by finan -
cial aspects. This underlines the fact that the 
ECB Governing Council will continue to attach 
particular significance to monetary and finan -
cial indicators. At the same time, it is important 
to the Governing Council that the findings from 
this side of analysis feed more heavily into the 
economic analysis too, in order to make sure 
that due weight is accorded to the relation -
ships between the real economic and financial 
spheres.70 It should be noted, however, that 
the monetary analysis now spans a much 
broader range of content than it did in its in -
fancy and incorporates short- term develop -
ments to a greater extent than before. These 
adjustments had previously been only partially 
reflected in the Eurosystem’s public communi -
cations.71 The strategy review was therefore an 
apt opportunity to close the gap separating 
public perception from the Eurosystem’s ana -
lytical practice.
The growing importance of analyses into the 
transmission of monetary policy through the 
financial sector is a good example of the in -
creased consideration being given to develop -
ments over the short- term horizon. In order to capture such transmission, the monetary analy -
sis traditionally looks at bank balance sheet 
data and interest rate data. In its expanded 
form, however, it also takes into account the 
financing conditions of other market agents as 
well as financing structures of non- financial 
corporations and households. This makes it 
possible to evaluate in a timely fashion whether 
transmission channels – such as the bank cap -
ital, credit, interest rate and risk- taking chan -
nels – are in good working order.72 Interest in 
analyses of this kind has grown considerably on 
the back of the increasing use being made of 
unconventional monetary policy measures, par -
ticularly since 2014. With this approach, the 
broadened monetary analysis has been able to 
identify disruptions in the transmission process 
over the past years. A credit crunch caused by 
weaknesses in the banking sector is one ex -
ample. This allowed the ECB Governing Council 
to make decisive improvements to the formula -
tion and efficacy of unconventional monetary 
policy.73 On top of this, the expanded monet -
ary analysis supplies important insights into fac -
tors which may constrain or alter the monetary 
policy space. These may be aspects such as po -
tential negative effects of low interest rate pol -
icy, but also, for example, structural shifts such 
as the growing importance of non- banks as 
financial intermediaries.74

mortgages in the targeted longer- term refinancing oper -
ations (TLTROs).

Monetary policy challenges due to climate change
Climate change is going to impact notice-
ably on the European economy in the com-
ing years and decades. Climate researchers 
consider it largely proven that the incidence 
of extreme weather events will increase in 
the future.1 2020 was the warmest year on 
record in Europe.2 However, it is not only 
climate change itself but also the policy 
measures taken to mitigate climate change 
or adapt living conditions to it that will pro-
duce economic effects.
These developments pose new challenges 
for the Eurosystem in the achievement of its 
primary objective, which is to safeguard 
price stability. First and foremost, it is crucial 
to gain a better understanding of the eco-
nomic implications of climate change and 
climate policy, and of the resulting risks to 
price stability, and to incorporate them into 
economic analyses, forecasts and models. 
The action plan published by the European 
Central Bank in July 2021 as part of the 
Euro system’s monetary policy strategy re-
view is one of the ways in which this task 
will be addressed.
Following the standard classifi  cation meth-
odology, climate- related fi  nancial risks can 
generally be subdivided into physical risks 
and transition risks. Physical risks are risks 
resulting from climate change itself – i.e. 
from changes in the statistical distribution 
of weather variables. Examples of such 
changes include an increased incidence of 
extreme weather events (storms, heavy pre-
cipitation, fl  oods, droughts, heatwaves, 
etc.), as well as a rise in the sea level, 
changes in the distribution of precipitation 
and in ocean currents, an increase in the 
average temperature and increasingly frost- 
free winters.Physical risks affect the economy through a 
variety of channels of impact, a handful of 
which are discussed in this box as examples. 
One obvious example is the risk that ex-
treme weather events will destroy parts of 
the capital stock of an economy, wipe out 
fi  rms and thus jobs, or impair household 
consumption.3 Another is that increased in-
vestment in measures to adapt to climate 
change (infrastructure measures such as 
fl  ood defences, private investment in resi-
dential and offi   ce buildings, etc.) will crowd 
out other, more productive forms of invest-
ment. The same can be said of capital used 
to repair and recover from the damage 
caused by extreme weather events. Third, 
there are likely to be (both positive and 
negative) changes in the productivity of cer-
tain sectors (e.g. agriculture), while geo-
1 A detailed presentation of the climatological changes 
for all regions of the world, including Europe, can be 
found in the latest report by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in August 
2021. This report’s fi  ndings include the following pre-
dictions for Europe (each with relatively high confi  -
dence): The average temperature in Europe will rise 
faster than the global average temperature in the com-
ing years. The frequency and intensity of extreme heat-
waves will continue to increase, with critical thresholds 
being exceeded given global warming of more than 
2°C. Days of frost will continue to fall in number. The 
decline in the amount of precipitation in summer will 
increasingly affect northerly regions as well. With the 
exception of the Baltic Sea, the sea level in Europe will 
continue to rise at least as quickly as the global aver-
age. The reduction of glaciers, permafrost and snow at 
high elevations will continue. For western and central 
Europe in particular, the IPCC report predicts more 
heavy precipitation events, an increase in river fl  oods 
and more hydrological and agricultural droughts.
2 According to data from the EU’s Copernicus Climate 
Change Service, the average temperature in Europe in 
2020 was more than 1.6°C above the long- term mean 
and 0.4°C above the highest temperature measured 
previously. The average temperature in autumn and 
winter 2020 was 3.4°C above the long- term mean and 
1.4°C above the highest temperature measured previ-
ously.
3 For example, the EU’s European Environment Agency 
estimates on the basis of data sourced from Munich 
Re AG that the economic losses caused by extreme 
weather events in all 27 EU Member States came to 
roughly €13 billion in 2019.Deutsche Bundesbank

physical changes might also impair global 
trade routes or disrupt supply chains. And 
lastly, all these developments are fraught 
with heightened macroeconomic uncer-
tainty, which in turn can impact on house-
hold and corporate consumption and in-
vestment patterns.
Many of these risks also concern the Ger-
man economy, but there is no question that 
they affect the European economies as a 
whole and thus have a bearing on price sta-
bility. Positive or negative shifts in the infl  a-
tion rate as a result of the aforementioned 
effects will depend on how shocks to sup-
ply and demand interact and on the uncer-
tainty surrounding these shocks, which 
means that there is no single way to deter-
mine them. Even so, it appears plausible 
that the real economy, and also infl  ation, 
will experience greater volatility in the fu-
ture as a result of extreme weather events. 
Recent consumer price dynamics in the 
euro area in response to the COVID- 19 pan-
demic may serve as a point of reference 
here, even if the extreme shock that trig-
gered them in this particular case is not dir-
ectly related to climate change.
Transition risks, meanwhile, are understood 
to be risks that result from the ongoing shift 
to a climate- neutral economy. These can in-
clude risks resulting from climate action but 
also those prompted, for example, by 
changes in consumer behaviour or techno-
logical advances. Economic theory suggests 
that the pricing of carbon (and carbon- 
equivalent) emissions – ideally applied glob-
ally and across all sectors – would be the 
most effi   cient policy instrument for internal-
ising the externalities associated with cli-
mate change. The EU Emissions Trading Sys-
tem (ETS) implements this instrument, albeit 
insuffi   ciently, at the EU level. In addition to 
the ETS, however, the euro area countries 
have a great many additional national cli-mate policies that often lack coordination 
within the country itself or with other Mem-
ber States.4
It is the task of the Eurosystem to under-
stand the economic implications of regula-
tory climate policies of this kind and take 
account of their effects on price stability in 
the euro area. These effects might include 
unemployment or growth losses in some 
sectors and regions or a boost to invest-
ment and innovation in others. There is also 
the danger of assets becoming stranded. 
This happens when the capital stock of an 
enterprise or sector abruptly or gradually 
loses value if that capital can no longer be 
used for production, or if production itself 
has ceased to be profi  table on account of 
higher carbon prices. Lastly, potential global 
trade confl  icts are another type of climate- 
related transition risk.
The aforementioned challenges were the 
backdrop against which the Eurosystem set 
about revising and expanding the meth-
odological framework for its economic ana-
lyses and forecasts. Integrated assessment 
models (IAMs) are the most common type 
of climate- related economic models.5 By in-
ternalising the externalities of climate 
change for an economy’s factor productiv-
ity, IAMs enable both an optimal consump-
tion and investment pathway and the asso-
ciated carbon price and emissions pathway 
to be determined. Alongside these cost- 
benefi  t IAMs, cost- effectiveness models also 
play an important role in macroeconomic 
4 Survey data gathered by the European Environment 
Agency in 2019 reveal that some EU Member States 
have as many as 100 different national regulatory pol-
icies on climate and environmental protection. OECD 
calculations show that the effective carbon tax result-
ing from regulatory policies of this kind for petrol, for 
example, varies across all 27 EU Member States be-
tween around €150 and €350 per tonne, while the 
effect ive carbon tax for coal is less than €50 per tonne 
across the bloc.

analyses. Put simply, cost- effectiveness 
models can be used to compute an eco-
nomically optimal pathway under the con-
straint of a particular climate objective (such 
as the 1.5°C target under the Paris Agree-
ment). While there is now a very advanced 
body of literature on IAMs, particularly on 
the modelling of key components such as 
the damage function, it remains diffi   cult to 
calibrate or estimate such models with any 
degree of reliability.
Blending IAMs with traditional economic 
central bank models is not only a core elem-
ent of the climate action plan adopted by 
the Eurosystem but also a challenge that 
will place great demands on all the national 
central banks and the European Central 
Bank. There has been a disconnect between 
climate- related IAMs and central bank 
macroeconomic models in two key respects 
hitherto. Traditional central bank models 
often lack the granularity needed to model 
the highly heterogeneous effects of climate 
change in different sectors and regions, 
while IAMs do not capture many of the 
monetary policy transmission channels or 
fail to do so adequately. The Eurosystem’s 
action plan has identifi  ed both fairly rudi-
mentary short- term solutions (“satellite ap-
proach”) as well as substantial medium- 
term model extensions. Scenario analyses 
are also under consideration for certain 
situations.
Furthermore, the Governing Council of the 
ECB decided to adapt the models the Euro-
system uses for economic forecasting, 
which will involve examining aspects such 
as the economic forecasting quality of wea-
ther and climate data or the prices of emis-
sions allowances. It will be crucially import-
ant here to take account of non- linearities 
and tipping points, which also means re-
viewing the existing methodological frame-
work for forecasts.Practical monetary policy implementation 
hinges on functioning fi  nancial markets. 
This is another area where climate change 
– through the channels of impact outlined 
above  – can have implications that re-
searchers still do not fully comprehend. For 
example, the aforementioned risk of asset 
stranding at the fi  rm level might impair 
monetary policy transmission, lower banks’ 
creditworthiness and ultimately reduce the 
supply of credit. Financial risks to the cen-
tral bank balance sheet can arise if, within a 
very short space of time, the prices of assets 
used for monetary policy transactions ex-
hibit severe volatility or necessitate write- 
downs as a result of climate change. Empir-
ical evidence suggests that capital markets 
are already pricing in these risks. Even so, it 
remains diffi   cult to assess whether or not 
those market price adjustments are ad-
equate.
Furthermore, greening the economy gener-
ally implies that there will be a surge in cor-
porate demand for capital that could well 
differ across countries and sectors. Little is 
known about how these capital needs will 
be covered and how global capital fl  ows 
will change in this regard. Newly emerging 
fi  nancing instruments such as green bonds 
might also have a bearing on monetary pol-
icy transmission.
One fi  nal key point for practical monetary 
policy implementation is that climate 
change could further narrow monetary pol-
icy space. That would be the case if the 
aforementioned macroeconomic effects 
end up lowering the natural rate of interest 
(which is often referred to as r* in models). 
The economy would then move closer to 
the effective lower bound, possibly necessi-
tating the increased use of unconventional 
monetary policy measures.Deutsche Bundesbank

infla tion when assessing longer- term risks to 
price stability. This is no longer the case. In an 
environment of low and stable inflation rates, 
as seen in the euro area in recent decades, the 
money- price relationship is empirically only very 
weak.75 Nonetheless, monetary and financial 
variables still contain valuable information on 
future price risks and economic dynamics, es -
pecially in the longer term: the models used for 
monetary and financial analysis can, for in -
stance, give indications of destabilising feed -
back mechanisms between the financial sector 
and the real economy. In addition, credit and 
other financial variables help to empirically pre -
dict tail risks to gross domestic product (GDP), 
often in connection with financial instabilities.76 
On top of that, financial shocks can be identi -
fied and their impact on future developments 
in GDP and inflation can be determined only in 
macroeconomic models that also contain mon -
etary and financial variables such as monetary 
and credit aggregates as well as bank lending 
rates.77As part of its strategy review, the Governing 
Council of the ECB also decided that financial 
stability considerations would be given greater 
weight in the monetary policy debate going 
forward.78 The idea is not to make financial sta -
bility an objective in its own right. Instead, the 
focus lies on the effects of financial imbalances 
on price stability in the medium term. The in -
creased interest on the part of the Governing 
Council is motivated by the recognition that 
financial stability is a precondition for price sta -
bility. Moreover, the experiences of the past 20 
years show that the interrelationship between 
price stability and financial stability has gained Monetary ana -
lyses continue to 
provide valuable 
information on 
longer- term 
price risks, 
despite  sharply 
weaker empir -
ical money- price 
relationshipIncreased inclu -
sion of financial 
stability aspects, 
but financial 
stability not a 
monetary policy 
objective in its 
own rightIt was for these reasons that the Governing 
Council of the ECB decided not only to 
deepen its macroeconomic analytical cap-
abilities but also to roll out a raft of add-
itional measures aimed at overcoming these 
practical challenges. First, the Eurosystem 
intends to improve the body of statistical 
data used to analyse fi  nancial risks from 
monetary policy transactions by playing an 
active role in developing climate risk indica-
tors. In addition, the disclosure and trans-
parency requirements for monetary policy 
counterparties are to be tightened, taking 
corresponding EU policies and initiatives in 
this fi  eld into account. The Eurosystem will 
furthermore conduct regular climate stress 
tests on its balance sheet to identify 
whether climate- related fi  nancial risks give 
any cause for concern. Internal and external 
credit ratings for monetary policy transac-
tions (collateral framework and asset pur-
chase programmes) will also be reviewed and developed further as appropriate. And 
lastly, the Eurosystem will analyse in the 
coming years whether the risks and exter-
nalities arising from climate change will ne-
cessitate an adjustment of the eligible uni-
verse for monetary policy purchase pro-
grammes and potentially for the monetary 
policy collateral framework.

in importance. The experiences with the finan -
cial and sovereign debt crisis also demonstrate 
that financial crises can cause significantly 
higher costs than initially expected, both be -
cause of a failure to meet the objective of price 
stability and through disruptions to the monet -
ary policy transmission process.
For these reasons, the Governing Council of 
the ECB expressly wants the option of incorpor -
ating financial stability aspects into its monet -
ary policy decisions. It intends to do this on a 
case- by- case basis and flexibly. A systematic re -
sponse to financial stability risks is not being 
considered. The evaluation of the information 
needed for such decisions will be integrated 
into the monetary and financial analysis.
It is not new for financial stability aspects to be 
included in the monetary analysis. The main 
source of trend monetary growth is bank lend -
ing,79 and excessive growth in such lending 
was already considered an early warning sign 
for potential instabilities in the financial system 
at the beginning of monetary union.80 In add -
ition, financial stability aspects have, for years, 
been taken into account in the monetary policy 
decision- making process through the analysis 
of the monetary policy transmission process. 
The significance of financial stability for monet -
ary policy means that this field of analysis is to 
be expanded even further now: a key point is a 
systematic assessment of potential tail risks to 
output and inflation that could arise from the 
longer- term build- up of financial vulnerabilities 
and imbalances. There will further be more ex -
tensive analyses of the side effects of the un -
conventional monetary policy. Analyses are also 
needed on the extent to which macropruden -
tial measures can contain financial stability risks 
with a bearing on monetary policy.
However, the complex interrelationships be -
tween monetary policy, financial stability and macroprudential policy have not yet been com -
prehensively researched, nor their interaction in 
various phases of economic and financial 
cycles. Here lies one area for development for 
future monetary and financial analysis.81 More -
over, additional work is required in order to 
better assess the proportionality of the use of 
various monetary policy instruments in an en -
vironment of mounting financial stability risks.
Concluding remarks
The Eurosystem’s new monetary policy strategy 
is designed to take into account the new and 
altered challenges that have arisen since the 
last review in 2003. With a new operationalisa -
tion of price stability, an altered monetary pol -
icy reaction function and greater recognition of 
the interconnectedness of the real economy 
and the financial system, the key elements of 
the new strategy reflect the challenges of re -
cent years. The inclusion of climate change 
means that one of the main tasks for the future 
has now also been incorporated into monetary 
policy analysis and implementation in terms of 
its economic impact. This is intended to equip 
monetary policy with the necessary framework 
to combat both inflationary and deflationary 
tendencies.
As the economic, financial and institutional 
environ ment in which monetary policy acts is 
subject to constant change, the ECB’s Govern -
ing Council has decided, however, to regularly 
review its monetary policy strategy going for -
ward. The next assessment is scheduled to take 
place in 2025.Financial

The impact of the Eurosystem’s monetary 
policy on Bitcoin and other crypto tokens
Bitcoin and other crypto tokens attract significant attention, mainly due to their considerable fluc -
tuations in value and, in some instances, high market valuations over a multi- year comparison. 
There is much evidence to show that monetary policy has a key impact on a number of conven -
tional assets, and it could therefore be assumed that this also holds true for the prices of crypto 
tokens. For example, it is sometimes claimed that accommodative monetary policy may have 
contributed to the value gains seen by crypto tokens. This article explores the influence of mon -
etary policy – particularly that of the Eurosystem – on the prices of Bitcoin and other crypto 
tokens.
Initial indications that the Eurosystem’s monetary policy may have an effect on the prices of 
crypto tokens are found when narrow time windows around monetary policy announcements are 
analysed. For example, crypto tokens’ considerable volatility and otherwise virtually non- existent 
correlation with other assets tend to be greater at times when monetary policy news is commu -
nicated. At the same time, however, there is also evidence to suggest that monetary policy has 
greater significance for the responses of share prices and exchange rates, for example, than for 
the responses of crypto token prices.
This impression is confirmed by an econometric analysis using vector autoregressive (VAR) models 
that can take account of the interdependencies between monetary policy and financial market 
developments. These models can be used to isolate monetary policy impulses and depict their 
effects on asset prices over a longer period of time. It is evident here, too, that the Eurosystem’s 
monetary policy has a significant impact on the prices of major crypto tokens, but that these 
impulses explain only a small fraction of the volatile price developments.
There are a multitude of ways in which crypto tokens differ in design from conventional assets. 
For instance, these tokens are units of account in distributed payment systems that are transferred 
using cryptographic procedures. Since amounts of value can be transferred digitally in a largely 
anonymous manner, tokens are also used for illegal purposes. There are often no central issuers, 
and new tokens are created on the basis of defined rules that do not allow for any flexible adjust -
ment of the number of tokens in circulation, such as in response to changes in demand. These 
particular features are also reflected empirically in that they contribute to the prices of crypto 
tokens fluctuating more strongly than share prices or exchange rates, for example, with which 
token prices have hardly any correlation. Thus, crypto tokens primarily serve as speculative assets; 
however, they are hardly suitable as a means of payment or a store of value, let alone as a unit 
of account.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Bitcoin and other crypto tokens1 have been at -
tracting increasing attention from the general 
public as well as among financial market par -
ticipants for some time. Originally conceived as 
a digital means of payment without the in -
volvement of intermediaries, they remained lit -
tle more than a niche phenomenon for many 
years. However, they are increasingly being met 
with the interest of a wider range of private 
and institutional investors. This interest is attrib -
utable, amongst other things, to the pro -
nounced fluctuations in the value of crypto 
tokens compared with other assets as well as 
their valuation level, which, in the case of some 
tokens, has increased on multiple occasions in 
the past. However, in this context, it is also 
often claimed that prices are driven by specula -
tive excess, as Bitcoin and other crypto tokens 
have no inherent value and are not backed by 
underlying collateral2 for which they could po -
tentially be exchanged. Another view that is 
sometimes expressed is that accommodative 
monetary policy has contributed to the value 
gains of crypto tokens.
Central banks fundamentally have great inter -
est in the impact of monetary policy on asset 
valuations. For example, changes in asset prices 
can provide an indication of the effectiveness 
of various monetary policy transmission chan -
nels. At the same time, crypto tokens such as 
Bitcoin are often purchased in the hope that 
they avoid the risks associated with conven -
tional monetary policy. For instance, Bitcoin 
was designed to be limited in supply and is 
therefore automatically scarce in order to pre -
serve its value over the long term.
The impact of the Eurosystem’s monetary pol -
icy on Bitcoin and other crypto tokens is ana -
lysed systematically in this article. This may help 
us gain a better understanding not only of the 
role crypto tokens play in the financial system, 
but also of the origins of their large fluctuations 
in value.Differences between crypto 
tokens and conventional 
assets
The oldest crypto token, Bitcoin, was created in 
2008 with the aim of laying the foundation for 
a decentralised and largely anonymous elec -
tronic payment system.3 Additionally, in view of 
the experience gained from the escalating 
global financial crisis at that time, the system 
was intended to be independent from com -
mercial and central banks, which play key roles 
in the traditional financial and payments sys -
tem.4 This is because banks act as intermediar -
ies – they carry out electronic payments by 
transferring funds from one account to an -
other. Furthermore, the stability of the value of 
the currency itself is determined by the actions 
of commercial and central banks: if commercial 
banks become distressed, holders may lose 
confidence in the value of the money created 
by these institutions. The massive interventions 
made by central banks in the wake of the finan -
cial crisis also caused some observers to have 
concerns about the risk of inflation that could 
erode the value of the euro.5
These considerations influenced the design of 
Bitcoin (see the box on pp. 63 ff.) in two ways: 
first, payments should be settled in a decentral -
ised manner. Whilst only the system operator, 
such as a bank, can execute and view pay -
ments in the case of central database systems, 
Bitcoin transfers are validated by many different  Growing interest

1 A crypto token is a digital token that is transferred within 
a network using a technical protocol based on crypto -
graphic procedures.
2 There is a specific category of crypto tokens – known as 
stablecoins – that is designed so that its price is stabilised 
vis- à- vis a reference value. The circulation of stablecoins is 
often backed by conventional assets; see the box on 
pp. 68-70. This specific form of token is not the focus of 
this in this article, however.
3 See Nakamoto (2008). Information on crypto tokens and 
the underlying technology in payments and securities 
settlement can be found in Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b) 
and Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).
4 See Nakamoto (2009).
5 Deflation – i.e. an increase in the value of the euro vis- à- 
vis goods – is also detrimental to the function of money as 
a means of payment. Many central banks therefore base 
their monetary policy around keeping the value of their 
currency stable against goods and services.Deutsche Bundesbank

How Bitcoin works
Bitcoin, at its core, consists of a database of 
transactions referred to as a ledger, which is 
extended with each entry according to a 
rigid set of rules. In contrast to centralised 
databases – such as the account systems of 
commercial banks  – the Bitcoin ledger is 
publicly viewable, maintained in a decen-
tralised manner by many different network 
participants and distributed across a com-
puter network.1 This distributed ledger is 
updated when new transactions are carried 
out. The payment units are called bitcoins.2 
In order for a decentralised payment system 
to function, it must fi  rst solve two funda-
mental problems: it must not be possible to 
carry out transactions without authorisation 
– that is, without the payer’s permission – 
and it must be possible to keep the ledger 
both synchronised across the whole net-
work and immune to alterations to com-
pleted transactions. Bitcoin solves these 
problems using cryptographic mechanisms.
If the ledger is distributed and designed to 
operate without a central authority, how, 
then, can individual participants be pre-
vented from creating unauthorised entries? 
In other words, what is to stop system par-
ticipants from simply writing an arbitrary 
number of transactions in the ledger with 
themselves as the payee, entirely without 
the consent of the payer? The answer lies in 
digital signatures. In a conventional central-
ised payment system, only the payer, the 
payee and the central authority, such as a 
bank, have knowledge of the transaction. 
The bank can use identity checks – such as 
checking a signature or a PIN – to deter-
mine whether a transaction is actually being 
carried out by the person whose account is 
being debited. In Bitcoin’s decentralised, 
public payment system, participants are as-
signed public keys – comparable to account numbers – in the form of character strings, 
between which transactions are carried out. 
Payments can be digitally signed by the 
sender via the additional use of a private 
key – roughly equivalent to a PIN or pass-
word.3 A digital signature can only actually 
originate from the payer if the private key 
they enter corresponds to their public key, 
which any participant in the system can 
easily verify using cryptographic algorithms 
without needing to know the private key. 
As the digital signature, which likewise con-
sists of a simple string of characters, can be 
copied an arbitrary number of times, pay-
ments could, in principle, be duplicated 
multiple times by any participant in the sys-
tem as soon as a private key had been 
entered. This is, however, stymied by the 
fact that the digital signature is determined 
not only by the relevant public keys and the 
payment amount, but also by a unique 
identifi  cation number. If the same digital 
signature were copied and used for a 
second, otherwise identical payment, the 
second payment would be recognised as in-
valid and not entered into the public ledger.
If the ledger is distributed across a number 
of computers, how is it kept synchronised? 
In other words, how can it be ensured that 
the same transactions are always entered in 
the same order on every computer? When a 
transaction is carried out, its execution must 
be recorded at every node in the network 
before further transactions can be carried 
1 Methods that rely on these and similar approaches 
are thus also referred to as distributed ledger technol-
ogy (DLT). See, for example, Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2017b).

out. In fact, the “balance” on each “ac-
count” – that is, each public key – implicitly 
represents the balance of all previous trans-
actions. In order for bitcoins to be trans-
ferred at all, therefore, there must have 
been more recorded infl  ows than outfl  ows 
in the past. Payees can only be certain that 
a transfer occurred if synchronisation is 
guaranteed. After all, a payee can only truly 
be sure they received payment if the net-
work participants agree that the amount re-
ceived was not already transferred else-
where before the transaction and that this 
assessment is very unlikely to change. It is 
therefore of the utmost importance that 
there is network- wide consensus about the 
order of transactions. It is in its solution to 
this problem that the truly innovative aspect 
of Bitcoin comes to light. Nakamoto (2008) 
proposed a consensus protocol: a set of 
rules that, using cryptographic methods, 
could determine the order of transactions 
and the right to enter new transactions into 
the ledger without recourse to a central au-
thority.
The basic principles of the Bitcoin protocol 
are that entering new transactions into the 
ledger must entail costs, and that new 
transactions must build on previous ones. 
This is achieved by using hash functions. 
Applying a hash function to any given char-
acter string (input) produces a new charac-
ter string with a fi  xed number of characters 
(output), which appears random but is in 
reality deterministically generated. The vital 
element in all this is that it is impossible to 
use the output to discover the input. Thus, 
if one wished to create an output which ful-
fi  lled certain criteria specifi  ed by the set of 
rules – such as an output beginning with a 
certain number of zeros – there would be 
no other option than to try a variety of ran-
dom inputs.This is how new payments are entered into 
the Bitcoin ledger: in order for a new pay-
ment to be recognised by the network, the 
participant wishing to enter the payment 
must have found a valid hash input. As the 
chances of fi  nding such an input in any one 
attempt are very low, it can be assumed 
that an extremely high number of attempts 
must have been made, which would in turn 
require the investment of a large amount of 
processing power.4 Once the input has 
been found, however, every participant can 
immediately use the hash function to verify 
that it solves the cryptographic puzzle – 
that is, that it creates an output that meets 
the requirements. All participants can then 
update their copy of the ledger to enter the 
new transactions. Subsequently, the hunt 
begins anew for inputs in order to add fur-
ther entries to the ledger. One crucial detail 
is that the input for the hash function is not 
entirely random, but instead consists in part 
of the solution to the previous entry. This 
ensures  that entries in the ledger build on 
each other, and thus have a set order. This 
also prevents work being done ahead of 
time – as the search for a solution always 
builds on the most recent entry, the search 
has to be started from scratch if another 
entry is added to the ledger fi  rst.5
Why, however, is it necessary in the fi  rst 
place for entering transactions in the ledger 
to entail costs in the form of the processing 
power used to solve cryptographic puzzles? 
The reason can be found in one of the rules 
of the protocol: that the network should al-
ways accept the version of the ledger that 
4 As presenting a solution counts as proof of the in-
vestment of processing power, this is also referred to 
as proof of work (PoW).
5 Eyal and Sirer (2014) formally examine the conditions 
under which it is more valuable to keep a found solu-
tion to a cryptographic puzzle to oneself, and instead 
“secretly” start work on the next puzzle.Deutsche Bundesbank

contains the most entries.6 To understand 
why, it is helpful to imagine an attempt to 
manipulate the ledger by retroactively chan-
ging the chain of transactions in order to, 
for example, undo certain transactions and 
spend bitcoins twice (known as double 
spending). If a participant wanted to at-
tempt this, they would need to present the 
network with a solution to the relevant 
cryptographic puzzle for the changed entry, 
i.e. expend processing power. That would 
not be all, however: the older the transac-
tion is, the more likely it is that there are al-
ready other entries in the ledger which have 
been built cryptographically on the transac-
tion marked for deletion. When would the 
network as a whole ignore these entries 
and instead accept the altered ledger? Due 
to the rule that new entries must build on 
the version of the ledger with the most en-
tries, the above would only happen if solu-
tions to cryptographic puzzles for more 
entries  could be presented than had subse-
quently been found by all other partici-
pants. This is extremely unlikely, provided 
more than half the processing power of the 
entire network cannot be combined – a 
feat that would come with high costs at-
tached.7 The Bitcoin protocol hinges, there-
fore, upon the idea that the cost of altering 
payment entries already accepted by the 
network is prohibitively high, thus protect-
ing the transaction history in the ledger 
from manipulation.
In practice, participants in the network who 
wish to have their transactions entered in 
the ledger do not solve the cryptographic 
puzzles described above themselves. In-
stead, they leave this job to parties known 
as miners, who have access to specialised 
hardware and thus a great deal of process-
ing power. Furthermore, transactions are 
not entered into the ledger individually, but 
are instead combined by miners into blocks 
ahead of time. As the ledger is thus entirely made up of a chain of blocks that are strung 
together, it is also referred to as a block-
chain, which is extended entry by entry.8 
The chart on p. 66 shows an example of 
the result of the process described above.
Adding new blocks entails high costs for 
miners, not only due to the high- performance 
hardware required but above all due to the 
enormous energy consumption involved.9 
They are reimbursed for this in two ways. 
First, participants can add fees to their 
transactions. In particular, when transac-
tions need to be marked as higher priority 
and many participants want to make pay-
ments at the same time, they increase these 
fees. They do so in order to be selected as 
quickly as possible by miners, who bundle 
pending payments one after another into 
blocks, which are limited in size. Second, 
the Bitcoin protocol stipulates that success-
ful miners be rewarded with newly created 
bitcoins for each new block they add to the 
ledger.10
6 This is known as the longest chain rule. For an analy-
sis of its actual suitability for maintaining consensus 
among system participants, see Halaburda et al. 
(2020).
7 For an analysis of the probability of a manipulation 
attempt using more than half the processing power of 
the network, see Garratt and Hayes (2014), Budish 
(2018) and Auer (2019).

of blockchain technology, see Federal Offi   ce for Infor-
mation Security (2019).
9 According to estimates from the Cambridge Centre 
for Alternative Finance from May 2021, total energy 
consumption for Bitcoin payment validation stands at 
144 TWh per year, roughly the total energy consump-
tion of the Netherlands. See also De Vries (2018). One 
factor in the high energy consumption is the price of 
Bitcoin itself. As described below, miners are remuner-
ated in Bitcoin and compete to fi  nd solutions to 
cryptographic puzzles. When Bitcoin prices rise, this 
creates incentives to invest in higher processing power, 
which in turn leads to the diffi   culty of the crypto-
graphic puzzles being raised – and thus increases the 
energy  consumption required to fi  nd the solution.
10 The conceptual analogy to mining for raw materials 
explains the “miner” nomenclature. Economic analyses 
of miners’ incentives can be found in, amongst others, 
Ma et al. (2018) and Prat and Walter (2021).Deutsche Bundesbank

Examining the creation of new bitcoins 
reveals  another important, unique element 
of the Bitcoin protocol. The rules set out 
roughly how long it takes to add a new 
block to the chain and how many bitcoins 
are earned for each block. The target is for 
a solution to a cryptographic puzzle to be 
found and a new block added to the chain 
roughly every ten minutes. To achieve this, 
the diffi   culty of the cryptographic puzzle is 
regularly adjusted – once every 2,016 blocks, 
to be precise.11 If a lot of processing power 
is invested by miners over a period of time, 
increasing the speed at which cryptographic 
puzzles are solved, the requirements for the 
hash function output are made stricter – 
increas ing the expected amount of time 
needed to fi  nd the solution. The diffi   culty is 
lowered, on the other hand, when adding 
new blocks has repeatedly taken longer 
than ten minutes on average. The number 
of new bitcoins that are created for each 
block is also periodically reduced, being 
halved every 210,000 blocks.12 When the 
network was created in 2009, the number 
of bitcoins created per block was 50. This 
was reduced to 25 at the end of 2012 and 
to 12.5 in mid- 2016. Since mid- 2020, the 
block reward rate has been 6.25 bitcoins. 
The rules thus ensure that the supply of Bit-coin grows in a very predictable manner 
while being limited in the long term. Ex-
trapolating this process into the future, the 
result is that there will never be more than 
21 million bitcoins in existence.13
11 Roughly once every two weeks.
12 Roughly once every four years.
13 This limit will be reached in or around the year 
2140, although more than 18 million bitcoins have 
already  been created. Of course, it is not inconceivable 
that the source code into which the 21 million bitcoin 
hard cap is encoded could be changed in the future. 
This already occurred when disputes amongst users led 
to a hard fork in 2017, where one part of the network 
was split off in order to increase the number of trans-
actions per time unit. It is certainly possible that an-
other such hard fork might occur due to disagreement 
over the total number of bitcoins or the creation of 
new bitcoins. While the original version of the protocol 
could continue to operate indefi  nitely, if market partici-
pants prefer the other version overall, the original 
token could become less important.Simplified illustration of the Bitcoin blockchain

participants and are publicly viewable in pseu -
donymised form.6 This aims to prevent depend -
ency on individual institutions at the heart of 
the system whose actions and continued exist -
ence would have to be relied upon.
A second point concerns the management of 
the supply of tokens in circulation, which, in 
the case of Bitcoin, is mechanically linked to 
adding transaction blocks to the payment regis -
ter and is therefore largely predictable. At the 
same time, it is stipulated that the issuance of 
Bitcoin will slow down over time and ultimately 
stop entirely, meaning that the total amount of 
bitcoins that will ever exist under the current 
ruleset is finite.7
In this respect, Bitcoin is comparable to other 
physically limited assets and means of pay -
ment.8 The rules governing its supply do not 
allow for any discretionary interventions. By 
contrast, central banks can adjust their monet -
ary policy stance as necessary and largely at 
their own discretion, thereby influencing the 
value of their issued currency – for instance, 
with the aim of maintaining price stability and 
preventing value fluctuations such as those typ -
ical for Bitcoin.
Finally, the lack of an issuer is another differ -
ence between Bitcoin and conventional assets. 
For example, there is no central entity against 
which a holder of Bitcoin could assert a legal 
claim. In fact, holding crypto tokens means 
nothing more than having a record in the net -
work’s payment register stating that units of 
value were transferred to the current holder at 
a previous point in time. Holders of tokens 
must therefore trust that the system will not be 
compromised and that they will not lose access 
to their own tokens, since it would not be pos -
sible to assert a claim in such a scenario. Bit -
coin is not backed by collateral and holding the 
token is not associated with any returns, such 
as interest payments on bonds or dividends on 
shares.In addition to Bitcoin, there are now a wide 
variety of other crypto tokens, which are re -
ferred to as “altcoins”.9 Depending on their de -
sign, these tokens can be very similar to Bitcoin 
in some cases or differ considerably in certain 
aspects (see the box on pp. 68 ff.). However, 
one thing many of the most important tokens 
in terms of market capitalisation have in com -
mon is that units of value are transferred in a 
decentralised manner and, although the 
amount in circulation is not necessarily finite, it 
grows mechanically without a central entity 
having discretion to make decisions about this. 
Despite the large number of altcoins, Bitcoin 
still remains by far the most significant token – 
this is referred to as Bitcoin dominance (see the 
box on pp. 71f.). For these reasons – and be -
cause Bitcoin, as the first crypto token, was 
conceived in response to aspects of the existing 
financial system that were perceived by some 
observers as problematic – this article largely 
focuses on Bitcoin as well as on some other 
major tokens with similar designs.

6 Transfers of Bitcoin take place between public keys (see 
the box on pp. 63 ff.), meaning that the identities behind 
the keys cannot be inferred directly.
7 However, in principle, it is conceivable that the ruleset 
could undergo changes in future, although this would re -
quire consensus amongst users to amend the protocol in 
this regard. See the box on pp. 63 ff.
8 In the eyes of some users, the mechanical supply of Bit -
coin is similar to that of naturally occurring commodities 
such as gold. In this case, too, supply is growing in a rela -
tively predictable way as a result of mining, but the total 
available amount of gold in existence on earth is limited. 
This association is also reflected by the term “Bitcoin min -
ing” – just like the mining of commodities, it generates 
costs and consumes a large amount of resources. As ex -
plained on pp. 63 ff., however, this use of resources does 
not actually serve to create new bitcoins, but instead is in -
tended to protect the blockchain, i.e. the payment register, 
against manipulation.

Other crypto tokens: altcoins
In addition to Bitcoin, there are a wide array 
of other crypto tokens known as altcoins.1 
The chart below illustrates the number 
of  crypto tokens listed over time on 
www.coinmarketcap.com. After a period of 
little movement up until the end of 2017, 
the number of new tokens then rose sharply 
– chiefl  y on the back of the steep increase 
in the Bitcoin price. At last count, there 
were well over 5,000 different crypto 
tokens; yet, measured in terms of market 
capitalisation, many of these are of minor 
signifi  cance.2
One reason for the creation of new crypto 
tokens is the emergence of novel block-
chain solutions that, for instance, are cap-
able of processing a larger number of trans-
actions, consume less energy or use a more 
complex computational logic than the Bit-
coin blockchain.3 These solutions vary in 
terms of the cryptographic hash functions 
used or the scale and frequency of new 
transaction blocks, whilst others have fun-
damentally different rules for validating 
transactions.4 In some cases, these differ-
ences in design are an attempt to address the characteristics of Bitcoin that are con-
sidered problematic.5
For instance, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was the 
product of a hard fork of Bitcoin created in 
2017 and designed to increase the size of 
transaction blocks from one to eight mega-
bytes.6 This was to address the lack of scal-
ability in the Bitcoin blockchain – i.e. the 
problem that only a very limited number of 
transactions could be processed within a 
certain period of time,7 which can lead to 
delayed transactions and high transaction 
costs.8 Previously, Litecoin had taken a dif-
ferent route by opting to generate its trans-
action blocks every two and a half minutes 
rather than every ten minutes as with Bit-
1 Short for alternative coins. For more details on their 
place in the development of crypto tokens, see also 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b, 2019, 2021).
2 CoinGecko’s website even lists more than 8,000 
tokens. CoinMarketCap, the source of the information 
on which this chart is based, also counts over 10,000 
in total. However, it only provides fi  gures on market 
prices and market capitalisation for the just over 5,000 
tokens included in the chart.
3 Furthermore, a number of blockchain solutions sup-
port the issuance of more than one type of crypto 
token, which can then be transferred via the block-
chain in question. This means that it is not always ne-
cessary to program a dedicated blockchain to issue a 
new crypto token.
4 For an explanation of terms such as “cryptographic 
hash function”, “transaction block” or “validation”, see 
pp. 63 ff.
5 By contrast, other market participants believe that 
the true strength of Bitcoin actually lies in some of 
these perceived weaknesses, such as the resource- 
intensive consensus mechanism.
6 This was the result of a major dispute in the Bitcoin 
community – the “block size wars” – which resulted in 
the blockchain being hard- forked, i.e. split into two 
ledgers. These two ledgers now coexist separately but, 
prior to the split, shared the same transaction history. 
For an overview of other hard forks in crypto tokens, 
see Soiman et al. (2021).
7 A maximum of around seven transactions can be val-
idated each second – a fraction of the volume that 
existing payment systems can manage.
8 Average transaction fees can run to in excess of 
US$50, especially when network utilisation is high. At 
quieter times, fees are well under US$1. For an eco-
nomic analysis of transaction fees, see Easley et al. 
(2019) and Huberman et al. (2020).Number of recorded crypto tokens*

coin, thus quadrupling the number of trans-
actions that can be validated.9
Other blockchains try to make up for the 
lack of scalability, a problem inherent in the 
Bitcoin blockchain, by using an alternative 
consensus mechanism such as proof of 
stake (PoS). In contrast to proof of work 
(PoW), the probability of a validator being 
selected is proportional not to their compu-
tational power but rather the amount of 
crypto tokens they lock up for this purpose 
(staking).10 A common feature of the two 
consensus mechanisms is, then, that the 
more system participants have invested 
–  be it in terms of computational power 
and specialised hardware for PoW or in 
terms of owning and staking crypto tokens 
for PoS – the greater the number of new 
transactions they can validate.11 In other 
words, both mechanisms are based on the 
idea that the more participants themselves 
are involved in the system, the lower their 
incentive to manipulate it and the more 
expen sive manipulations would be for third 
parties. Supporters of PoW sometimes 
argue that PoS is not as safe. However, as 
PoS does not involve mining, it consumes 
much less energy. The best- known block-
chains developed using the PoS approach 
are Cardano, Solana, Algorand and Tezos. 
Efforts are also under way to convert exist-
ing blockchain solutions to PoS.12
Furthermore, blockchains have been de-
veloped over the course of time that have 
additional functions compared with the Bit-
coin blockchain. The best- known example 
is the Ethereum blockchain, which was 
launched in 2015.13 On the Ethereum block-
chain, the execution of transactions can be 
“programmed” using complex smart con-
tracts. Such contracts can be used to auto-
matically execute complex use cases, which 
can sometimes lead to the creation of de-
centralised fi  nancial applications.14One important category of crypto tokens is 
stablecoins.15 Unlike other tokens where 
prices fl  uctuate according to supply and de-
mand, with stablecoins the aim is to keep 
9 In 2018, the BCH block size was increased again to 
32 megabytes. Other market participants use innov-
ations in the Bitcoin network itself to address the prob-
lem of a lack of scalability. One example is the Light-
ning Network, which enables private payment chan-
nels to be opened between peers, with the blockchain 
itself being used only to validate their balances; see 
Divakaruni  and Zimmerman (2020).
10 For a formal microeconomic analysis of PoS, see 
Gans and Gandal (2019).
11 With PoS, the probability of being selected is based 
on the number of coins that a potential validator is 
prepared to lock up for a certain time. These coins 
serve as a security of sorts for the network. In proven 
cases of rule- breaking, the validator’s coins are des-
troyed as a way of incentivising honest behaviour.

making the switch for the Ethereum network de-
scribed below.

assets, particularly with respect to their suscep -
tibility to fluctuations in value.
The market prices of Bitcoin and other major 
tokens that have existed for many years, such 
as Ether and Litecoin, show an upward trend in 
market value overall. However, their market 
price movements also exhibit numerous distinct 
cycles. In these boom and bust phases, the 
token prices appreciate strongly within a rela -
tively short period of time, and then lose a 
large share of their increase in value again.
In order to gain a sense of the degree to which 
crypto tokens fluctuate in value, a comparison 
with the prices of other assets can be made, 
for example, by looking at the volatility of daily 
returns – a measure of the typical percentage 
changes in returns from day to day.11 On aver -
age over recent years, the daily return on risky 
shares – for example, for an index of the larg -
est publicly listed corporations in terms of mar -
ket capitalisation in the euro area – fluctuated by around 1 percentage point over the period 
of one day. Return fluctuations were slightly 
lower in the case of gold, and the rate of 
change in the euro/  US dollar exchange rate 
typically fluctuated by just less than ½ percent -
age point. By contrast, the volatility of crypto 
tokens was many times higher. While the re -
turns on Bitcoin fluctuated in value by around 
4 percentage points, the average daily shift in 
the value of Ether and Litecoin was even 
greater at around 6  percentage points. And 
even these considerably higher figures apply 
only to an average day. This means that they 
obscure the fact that, in the past, the market 
prices of the crypto tokens mentioned above 
rose or fell by several dozen percent multiple 
times within the space of just one day.
However, not only are the market prices of 
tokens exceptionally volatile, but the returns on Market prices of 
crypto tokens

volatility  …the price stable.16 Most existing stablecoins 
try to keep their exchange rate at par with 
the US dollar. Others are pegged to the 
euro or other currencies, precious metals 
such as gold, or a basket containing several 
assets.
The chart on p. 69 shows the market capit-
alisation of existing stablecoins.17 In con-
trast to crypto tokens with fl  uctuating 
prices, growth in market capitalisation is 
not primarily a refl  ection of valuation ef-
fects. If there is demand for additional sta-
blecoins, new tokens have to be generated 
in order to keep the price constant. As sup-
ply thus responds fully elastically to de-
mand, growth in market capitalisation 
means an increase in the number of tokens 
in circulation. In comparison to the overall 
market for all crypto tokens, however, the 
market for stablecoins is still small (just over 
5% at the end of August 2021). Neverthe-less, measured in terms of transaction vol-
ume on both crypto exchanges and decen-
tralised trading platforms, stablecoins are 
playing an increasingly important role.18
16 There are various approaches to trying to maintain 
price stability. These include backing the tokens with 
liquid funds from precisely those assets against which 
the price of the stablecoin is to be kept stable, as well 
as algorithms. In practice, it is not always possible to 
keep the price stable, and the value of some stable-
coins has already drifted far from their target price. For 
an economic analysis of the stability risks associated 
with stablecoins and of issuers’ incentives, see Li and 
Mayer (2020), Klages- Mundt et al. (2020) and 
d’Avernas et al. (2021). Gorton and Zhang (2021) offer 
an account of how stablecoins fi  t into the history of 
money and fi  nance.

result, they are less reliable than data from offi   cial insti-
tutions but nonetheless give a rough overview of con-
ditions and are often used even in academic research;

Tsyvinsky  (2018).

The dominance of Bitcoin in the market for crypto tokens
The market for crypto tokens has grown sig-
nifi  cantly over recent years. In the fi  rst few 
years following the introduction of Bitcoin, 
the market capitalisation of all tokens – i.e. 
the number of tokens in circulation multiplied 
by their prices, expressed in euro – amounted 
to just a few billion euro; over the course of 
2017, it grew rapidly and exceeded €600 bil-
lion for the fi  rst time in December of that year. 
Market capitalisation then declined in 2018, 
but rose again sharply at the end of 2020, 
reaching a record high of almost €2 trillion in 
May 2021.1
First and foremost, this development is a re-
fl  ection of valuation effects: the total market 
capitalisation of all tokens fl  uctuates primarily 
in line with the market values of individual 
tokens. Another driver of this market growth 
is the fact that new crypto tokens are con-
stantly being created. In the fi  rst few years fol-
lowing the introduction of Bitcoin in January 
2009, only a few new coins emerged –  in-
cluding Litecoin, Ripple and Ether – however, 
especially after the sharp rise in prices at the 
end of 2017, a large number of new crypto 
tokens entered into the market.2
While Bitcoin still represented more than 90% 
of market capitalisation in 2014, its market 
share dropped to less than 40% for a time 
during the course of 2017. The shares of 
newer, smaller crypto tokens grew to more 
than 20%, and other already established 
tokens, such as Ether, also gained ground. Al-
though there were then thousands of crypto 
tokens in existence at that point, Bitcoin re-
mained the most signifi  cant by a considerable 
margin. As a result, Bitcoin’s sole share of the 
total market grew again from 2018, standing 
at 44% at the end of August 2021 – this is re-
ferred to as Bitcoin dominance.3Alongside market capitalisation, trading vol-
umes on crypto exchanges are an additional 
indicator that can be used to assess the sig-
nifi  cance of the market as a whole as well as 
of individual crypto tokens. There are a num-
ber of websites that provide fi  gures on the ag-
gregate trading volume across the many 
crypto trading platforms where crypto tokens 
can be exchanged for traditional currencies or 
for each other. Depending on the crypto 
token in question, these fi  gures on trading 
volumes amount to several billion euro per 
day, but are often believed to be considerably

the major tokens also show no systematic cor -
relation with those of conventional assets. For 
instance, the returns on the three crypto tokens 
mentioned above barely correlate with those of 
shares or exchange rates: the respective correl -
ation coefficients are close to zero. The correl -
ation with gold is only slightly higher.
By contrast, the relationships between the 
three crypto tokens analysed in this context re -
veal a completely different picture. The correl -
ation here is considerable – the coefficients are 
greater than 0.5 and thus relatively high. Token 
prices therefore tend to move in tandem over 
the course of a day, but behave differently to 
those of shares, exchange rates or precious 
metals. In fact, academic studies show that 
crypto tokens have risk- return relationships 
that have differed fundamentally from those of 
conventional assets in the past.12Conceptual considerations 
regarding the impact of 
monetary policy on crypto 
tokens
A large body of literature on economics investi -
gates how the market prices of various assets 
are determined. Theoretical considerations sug -
gest that share prices, for example, are de -
pendent on the expected future profits of the 
issuing enterprise and on the interest rate used 
to discount these profits distributed as divi -
dends. This means that changes in monetary … low correl -

have impact on 
asset prices, e.g. 
for shares …overstated.4 Nevertheless, analysing the 
shares of each traded crypto token can pro-
vide some indication of their relative signifi  -
cance. As before, this shows the market dom-
inance of Bitcoin with a market share of around 
34%, followed by Ether with approximately 
26%.5Finally, the dominance of Bitcoin can also be 
seen in the public interest in various crypto 
tokens, for example, as measured by the rela-
tive frequency of worldwide search queries 
using the Google search engine. Here, a dis-
tinction is made between the term “Bitcoin” 
and the terms “Litecoin” and “Ethereum”. The 
fi  gures are stated relative to the maximum 
level of search interest for “Bitcoin”, which 
was recorded in December 2017. The adjacent 
chart clearly shows that Bitcoin is dominant in 
the public perception, too.
4 According to estimations, a substantial proportion of 
the reported trading volume on the major crypto trad-
ing platforms consists of what are known as “wash 
sales”; see Cong et al. (2021) and Aloosh and Li (2021). 
In these sales, investors issue buy and sell orders at the 
same time in order to create artifi  cial trading volume 
on the crypto trading platforms. Reported trading vol-
umes play a role, for example, when crypto trading 
platforms compete for market share and transaction 
fees.

Cap for the trading volumes in a 30- day period from 
mid- July to mid- August 2021. Stablecoins, which are 
often used to exchange between crypto tokens, are 
not taken into consideration here.Google search queries for selected

12 Liu and Tsyvinski (2018) analyse the extent to which the 
prices of the three crypto tokens Bitcoin, Ripple and Ether 
are dependent on determining factors that are often em -
ployed in empirical economic research to explain returns on 
shares, for example. The authors come to the conclusion 
that the correlations detected for other asset classes do not 
apply to the crypto tokens mentioned above. Instead, they 
identify crypto token- specific determining factors, such as 
with regard to past returns on tokens (momentum factor). 
Using various criteria, Ankenbrand and Bieri (2018) confirm 
that crypto tokens represent their own asset class that dif -
fers in a variety of ways from conventional assets.Deutsche Bundesbank

policy should affect share prices in at least two 
ways: if, for example, the central bank lowers 
its policy rate or communicates a lower future 
interest rate path, expected corporate profits 
will be discounted to a lesser extent, mechanic -
ally increasing their present value. In addition, if 
the interest rate cut also stimulates general 
economic activity, profit expectations them -
selves might also improve, which would like -
wise result in higher share prices.
Monetary policy impulses also affect exchange 
rates, i.e. the relative price of two currencies. 
According to theory, the exchange rate be -
tween a pair of currencies should depend 
largely on the relative levels of interest rates in 
the two currency areas.13 If, for instance, inter -
est rates in the euro area were to fall, some of 
the demand for interest- bearing securities 
would possibly shift to the United States, pro -
vided that interest rates were not also falling there. Accordingly, there would be greater de -
mand for the US dollar and lower demand for 
the euro – the single currency would hence de -
preciate against the US dollar.14
It stands to reason that monetary policy im -
pulses from the Eurosystem should have an ef -
fect on the euro prices of crypto tokens, too. 
Just as the euro would depreciate against, say, 
the US dollar if the Eurosystem were to loosen 
its monetary policy stance (i.e. the price of the 
US dollar would rise measured against the 
euro), it can be assumed that the euro prices of 
other assets and goods would also increase, in -… and

cluding the euro price of Bitcoin. As long as Bit -
coin can be traded internationally against vari -
ous currencies with only minimal friction, the 
euro price and the US dollar price of the token 
converted into euro at the current exchange 
rate should only differ marginally during the 
adjustment process. Otherwise, it would be 
possible to conduct arbitrage transactions.15
However, why the price of Bitcoin in US dollar 
should also change is less obvious at first. Un -
like bonds, Bitcoin does not promise to pay any 
interest, and unlike shares, it promises no divi -
dends that would increase or be less heavily 
discounted as a result of monetary policy eas -
ing. Furthermore, Bitcoin is still not widely used 
as a means of payment in day- to- day economic 
life, so it stands to reason that its value should 
not be driven primarily by the level of economic 
activity, which monetary policy easing is in -
tended to stimulate.16
Instead, the effects of monetary policy on 
token prices could be rooted in the claim that 
holding Bitcoin supposedly protects against in -
flation. If monetary policy easing makes the 
hypothetical scenario of a rapid decrease in the 
euro’s purchasing power more probable in the 
eyes of individual market participants, they may 
seek to invest primarily in assets not subject to 
discretionary decision- making regarding their supply. The Bitcoin price would then benefit to 
an especially large extent from monetary policy 
that is perceived as excessively expansionary.17
Lastly, the high valuation levels of crypto tokens 
are sometimes also seen simply as an expres -
sion of speculative excesses, which are sup -
posedly attributable to, amongst other things, 
loose monetary policy. Due to the fact that, in 
some cases, even risky bonds do not offer posi -
tive interest rates, investors may increasingly 
consider highly speculative assets in their search 
for yield and hope for further price gains.18 So, 
given that crypto tokens do not promise any 
returns and are also not widely used as a means 
of payment, their high market prices can be 
best explained by a surge in liquidity triggered

15 Investors would buy Bitcoin at a low price in euro, sell it 
at a higher price in US dollar, and then exchange the ac -
quired US dollar currency back for the depreciated euro. In 
fact, the prices of crypto tokens in different currencies are 
not entirely immune from what are ostensibly arbitrage op -
portunities. For example, there may be persistent differ -
ences between the US dollar price of Bitcoin and its price 
(converted into US dollar) in other currencies, especially 
those of developing countries and emerging market econ -
omies. These price differences reflect frictions in the afore -
mentioned adjustment process, which can stem from fac -
tors such as transaction costs and capital controls or from 
risks arising from the high volatility of prices; see Kroeger 
and Sarkar (2016) and Makarov and Schoar (2020). In the 
past, the price difference has been particularly pronounced 
for the Korean won; see Choi et al. (2020). By contrast, the 
differences between the US dollar and euro prices of Bit -
coin are usually very small, and the arbitrage transactions 
described above are primarily for illustrative purposes.
16 For example, Liu and Tsyvinski (2018) find no evidence 
that Bitcoin’s market value is dependent on macroeco -
nomic activity.
17 It is possible that an effect of this kind would be felt pri -
marily at significantly higher inflation rates than those ob -
served in the recent past. Such a non- linear effect would 
be more difficult to prove on the basis of historical data. 
For more details on the fundamental problem of proving 
the causal effects of monetary policy impulses, see the rele -
vant section of this article on pp. 77 f.
18 See Rajan (2005) and Borio and Zhu (2012). This behav -
iour is documented, in particular, for financial institutions 
such as banks or money market and pension funds; see, 
for  example, Jiménez et al. (2015) and Di Maggio and 
Kacperczyk (2016). But there is also evidence to suggest 
that households are searching for yield by rebalancing their 
portfolios in favour of more profitable forms of investment; 
for the case of Germany, see, for example, Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2016a). If asset prices rise, financial market par -
ticipants might also reckon with decreasing probabilities of 
loss, which is why a loose monetary policy stance could 
help encourage them to take on additional risks; see, for 
example, Deutsche Bundesbank (2016b).Deutsche Bundesbank

by monetary policy, which drives up the market 
prices of all kinds of risky assets.19
Therefore, if speculation fuelled by monetary 
policy or concerns about future inflation are in -
deed major factors driving the performance of 
Bitcoin and other crypto tokens,20 it would be 
expected that their prices respond sensitively to 
monetary policy impulses. The extent to which 
this is the case is examined below.
Insights into the significance 
of Eurosystem monetary 
policy  for crypto tokens
In order to get a sense of whether and how 
monetary policy decisions affect asset prices, 
the economic literature often looks at the re -
sponses of these prices in narrow time win -
dows around the announcements of monetary 
policy decisions.21 If, for example, share prices 
rise immediately after a monetary policy an -
nouncement is made, but move sideways be -
forehand and afterwards, it can be plausibly 
concluded that the increase is primarily attrib -
utable to the monetary policy impulse. Indeed, 
there is ample empirical evidence that the 
prices of bonds, shares and foreign currencies 
often respond immediately and significantly to 
monetary policy decisions.22 Initial insights into 
the effect of Eurosystem monetary policy on 
crypto tokens could therefore be gained by ex -
panding this type of analysis to cover token 
prices, as described below. In this context, the 
currency in which crypto token prices are ex -
pressed is key. Given that, as stated above, the 
effect on token prices expressed in euro is 
hardly surprising and Bitcoin is mainly traded 
against the US dollar, token prices are ex -
pressed exclusively in US dollar in the following 
analysis.
First, the average return volatility of Bitcoin and 
other assets in the time windows around the 
announcements of monetary policy decisions 
by the ECB Governing Council is examined. The 
period analysed begins 15 minutes before the ECB press release is published at 13:45 and 
lasts until 75 minutes after the subsequent 
press conference starts at 14:30, spanning all in 
all from 13:30 to 15:45. Studying these short 
time periods, it turns out that the already vola -
tile Bitcoin prices are, on average, just over 
10% more volatile than in comparable time 
windows on normal afternoons on which no 
monetary policy announcements are made. 
This finding could indicate that monetary policy 
decisions are also important to crypto token 
markets because they lead to unusually large 
price swings. However, the difference between 
days with monetary policy announcements and 
those without is not statistically significant, at 
least if days with extreme value fluctuations are 
included in the analysis.23
Further information can be gleaned by compar -
ing these results with equivalent calculations 
for the gold price, the euro/ US dollar exchange 
rate and the stock price indices S&P 500 (for 
the United States) and EURO STOXX 50 (for the 
euro area). It transpires that some of these re -
turns experience considerably larger increases 
in volatility in the time windows around the an -
nouncements of monetary policy decisions. For 
example, the average volatility for the EURO 
STOXX 50 is twice as high as usual, while that … but hypoth -

20 According to De Haan and van den End (2017), there is 
a connection here. In the past, unusually high asset prices 
were often also an indicator of high future inflation rates.
21 Kuttner (2001) and Gürkaynak et al. (2005) were 
among the first studies to propose this approach, which 
has since become established practice. Generally, all sched -
uled meetings of the relevant monetary policy decision-  
making body are taken into account, irrespective of the an -
nouncements made. In particular, whilst a monetary policy 
decision need not necessarily be related to a change in pol -
icy rates or asset purchase programmes, all monetary pol -
icy communication within a narrow time frame around 
press releases and press conferences following the meet -
ings is analysed.
22 See Zettelmeyer (2004), Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), 
Altavilla et al. (2019), Gilchrist et al. (2019), Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2017a, 2020) and Gürkaynak et al. (2021).
23 The difference amounts to around one- third and is stat -
istically significant if the most volatile 10% of all days are 
excluded when calculating the values. There have been ex -
treme fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin on a number of 
days in the past. By excluding these particularly volatile 
movements, it is thus possible to compare more “ordinary” 
days with those on which monetary policy announcements 
were made.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

of the euro/ US dollar exchange rate is just over 
two and a half times as high. These differences 
are each statistically highly significant. The in -
creases in return volatility for gold and the US 
stock price index S&P 500 are only somewhat 
higher than that for Bitcoin. However, at least 
for gold, the corresponding confidence inter -
vals show that the increase in return volatility is 
subject to a lower degree of uncertainty than 
that for Bitcoin.
A similar comparison can be made with respect 
to the second characteristic of crypto tokens 
discussed above: their low correlation with the 
market prices of other assets. To this end, one 
can look at correlation coefficients between 
the returns on Bitcoin and those on stock price 
indices, gold and the euro/ US dollar exchange 
rate in the aforementioned narrow time win -
dows around monetary policy announcements 
by the ECB Governing Council. It turns out that 
the co- movement of returns is higher than nor -
mal, with correlation coefficients increasing 
from below 10% to almost 30%.24 In this com -
parison, too, however, the increase is not stat -
istically highly significant in all cases and it is 
lower than the increased correlation between 
stock price indices and exchange rates, for ex -
ample – by way of illustration, the correlation 
between the EURO STOXX 50 and the euro/ US 
dollar exchange rate amounts to around 60% 
within the monetary policy time window.
In summary, the findings so far indicate that 
monetary policy decisions could also be of rele -
vance to crypto tokens such as Bitcoin. At the 
same time, the relative influence of monetary 
policy on the market prices of shares, precious 
metals and foreign currencies appears at first 
glance to be more significant. However, the 
previous analysis only considers the immediate 
responses of different asset prices to monetary 
policy announcements. The already very high Bitcoin price

volatility of crypto token prices could make it 
difficult to unambiguously demonstrate any im -
pact of monetary policy within these short 
periods of time. What is more, the markets for 
crypto tokens are also less liquid than those of 
many conventional assets, which could further 
limit the informative value of an analysis based 
on high-  frequency data alone. The question 
therefore arises as to whether any systematic 
impact of monetary policy can also be deter -
mined over longer periods and whether mon -
etary policy impulses can explain a quantita -
tively significant portion of the movements in 
crypto token prices over time. Answering such 
questions requires econometric models that 
allow causal statements to be made about the 
dynamic effects of monetary policy impulses.
Econometric analyses on the 
causal effect of monetary 
policy impulses on crypto 
tokens
In order to be able to examine the impact of 
monetary policy on financial market prices and 
other variables over time, it is necessary to dis -
tinguish monetary policy impulses from other 
potential driving forces. Whilst in the high-  
frequency analysis an immediate market re -
sponse to ECB announcements could plausibly 
be attributed primarily to monetary policy im -
pulses, this is not the case over longer periods 
of time.
The problem can be illustrated by means of the 
following example: as many central banks 
around the world are committed to price stabil -
ity as part of their mandate, their aim is to sta -
bilise the inflation rate at a low level. At least in 
the short term, however, the inflation rate is 
determined by many factors besides monetary 
policy, such as events on international com -
modity markets or wage agreements impacting 
the prices of firms’ intermediate goods or la -
bour costs. If the central bank were to antici -
pate increasing price pressures overall, it would 
raise interest rates in order to counteract rising inflation. If the central bank succeeds in keep -
ing the inflation rate stable at close to its target 
in the months that follow, however, it cannot 
be concluded that the interest rate increase 
had no effect on the price level – after all, with -
out monetary policy adjustment, inflation 
would have risen as expected. And even if the 
central bank were to react too tentatively, i.e. if 
the inflation rate were to increase somewhat, it 
would be wrong to arrive at the conclusion 
that interest rate hikes instead cause prices to 
rise rather than fall. In order to draw any con -
clusions regarding the causal effect of a mon -
etary policy impulse, then, it is not enough to 
simply examine how certain variables behave 
over longer intervals after a monetary policy in -
strument is altered.
In order to solve these problems, the economic 
literature has developed econometric models 
that enable structural shocks to be identified. In 
these models, the many observable potential 
determinants that can influence prices and 
other economic variables are broken down into 
individual, clearly differentiated components 
(shocks). When it comes to monetary policy, 
this means that the models attempt to isolate 
the component – such as a change in interest 
rates  – that does not simply represent a re -
sponse by the central bank to other exogenous 
factors, but one where it actively intervenes. If 
this is successful, the models are able to isolate 
the causal effect of monetary policy on individ -
ual variables over time and determine its rela -
tive significance.

A number of different methods have been de -
veloped over time for this purpose, and ap -
proaches that draw on information from out -
side the model are becoming increasingly 
popular, especially for identifying monetary 
policy shocks. Proxy VAR models, for example, 
make use of instrumental variables,25 which 
often include the responses of short- term inter -
est rates within narrow time windows around 
monetary policy announcements. Somewhat 
similar to the immediate responses of other 
financial market variables outlined above, it is 
plausible that such changes to short- term inter -
est rates are predominantly triggered by mon -
etary policy decisions or announcements, 
whilst other determinants are likely to have 
hardly any effect. The interest rate responses 
also indicate that, to at least some extent, 
these decisions were not expected by market 
participants. Changes to interest rates there -
fore do not represent merely the central bank’s 
response to changes in economic activity, as 
these should have already been incorporated 
into market prices.26 By adding the information 
on immediate interest responses, it is possible 
to estimate which component of the change in 
interest rates not explained by the first step of 
the model can actually be attributed to the ex -
ogenous monetary policy impulse.
Results based on a proxy VAR 
model
After identifying the monetary policy impulses, 
their dynamic effects on the individual model 
variables can then be calculated, i.e. how the 
variables change over time solely due to mon -
etary policy. A study conducted at the Bundes -
bank reaches the conclusion that the price of 
Bitcoin does indeed respond to Eurosystem 
monetary policy impulses to a statistically sig -
nificant degree.27 An unexpected reduction in 
the euro area’s short- term interest rate level is 
estimated to lead to a persistent increase in the 
market value of Bitcoin as well as of other 
crypto tokens such as Ether and Litecoin. At 
first glance, the increase in prices is greater here than for shares or foreign currencies, 
which also see gains in value. If the much 
higher volatility of token prices is taken into ac -
count, however, this impression is relativised 
and the effects are of a roughly similar magni -
tude (see the box on pp. 79 ff.).
This observation gives rise to the question of 
what overall share of the pronounced fluctu -
ations in token prices can be attributed to 
monetary policy impulses from the Eurosystem. 
This question can also be answered using the 
econometric model, according to which the 
contribution made by monetary policy impulses 
is moderate: they are able to explain less than 
10% of the variance in Bitcoin prices. Similar re -
sults are found for Ether and Litecoin. The 
much larger share of the changes in token 
prices must therefore be attributable to factors 
other than monetary policy in the euro area.28 
These might include changes in the general risk 
appetite of financial market participants,29 but 
also factors specific to crypto tokens.30 For ex -

25 This approach was largely developed by Stock and Wat -
son (2012) and Mertens and Ravn (2013). It was first used 
to identify monetary policy shocks by Gertler and Karadi 
(2015).
26 If the central bank has information on future economic 
developments that is unknown to the market and therefore 
as yet unpriced, the market response could be attributed to 
an information shock. However, as outlined in the box on 
pp.  79 ff., such effects are controlled for in the current 
econometric analysis.
27 See Karau (2021).
28 US monetary policy also has a relatively low explanatory 
power in the model; see the box on pp. 79 ff.

vas et al. (2020) analyse, for instance, the extent to which 
Bitcoin benefits from uncertainty in the international finan -
cial markets and can function as a hedging instrument.
30 Conlon and McGee (2020) establish that, prior to 2016, 
some of Bitcoin’s price changes are associated with gam -
bling transactions that can be conducted using the Bitcoin 
blockchain. Corbet et al. (2020) attribute some of the high 
volatility in the Bitcoin price to numerous cases of fraud 
and hacker attacks where bitcoins were illegally misappro -
priated. Gandal et al. (2018) analyse price manipulations in 
2013 on the most significant crypto token trading platform 
at the time, Mt. Gox. According to Griffin and Shams 
(2020), the stablecoin Tether has been used in the past to 
manipulate the price of Bitcoin. In any case, crypto tokens 
are often associated with illegal activities. Foley et al. 
(2019) provide estimations of this using blockchain data 
and conclude that the illegal use of Bitcoin is a not insignifi -
cant driver of its market value.Deutsche Bundesbank

The impact of monetary policy on crypto tokens in a VAR 
model
In a forthcoming Bundesbank discussion 
paper, the effects of monetary policy im-
pulses on the market for crypto tokens are 
investigated using vector autoregressive 
(VAR) models.1
A VAR model consists of n  variables that 
interact with one another over time. Rather 
than attempting to explain a specifi  c vari-
able using multiple others, each variable is 
regressed on lagged values of all of the vari-
ables included in the model. In mathemat-
ical terms, the estimated reduced form of 
the model is thus represented by the fol-
lowing system of equations
yt=c+B1yt1+B2yt2+...
+Bpytp+ut,
where y and c  are respectively ( n ×1) vec-
tors of the endogenous model variables 
and constants, and p describes the number 
of lags taken into consideration. The (n ×n) 
matrices Bi (where i = 1 ,…,p) contain the 
estimated regression coeffi   cients, which in-
dicate how the variables are dependent on 
one another over time. Finally, ut is an 
(n ×1) vector of model residuals.
In total, six variables are included in the VAR 
model estimation:2 the two- year euro area 
EONIA swap rate as a short- term interest 
rate,3 the EURO STOXX 50 share price index, 
the euro/ US dollar exchange rate, the VIX 
index (a measure of stock market volatility 
for the United States derived from options 
prices),4 the VSTOXX (counterpart to the 
VIX for euro area shares), and, lastly, the 
price of Bitcoin in US dollars.5 The reduced 
form of the model is estimated using Bayes-
ian methods based on weekly data from the start of July 2013 to the end of June 
2021.6
Following such a regression, the resulting 
model residuals are deviations of the ob-
served data from the values predicted by 
the model. However, analysing the residuals 
1 See Karau (2021).
2 With regard to the variables and the sample period, 
the model presented here is a slightly modifi  ed version 
of the models estimated in Karau (2021).
3 In the past, monetary policy impulses were often 
identifi  ed using money market interest rates with ma-
turities shorter than two years. However, these have 
exhibited hardly any response to monetary policy deci-
sions since March 2016, when the ECB Governing 
Council decided to lower the main refi  nancing rate to 
zero. For this reason, the literature has transitioned to 
analysing somewhat longer- term interest rates, which 
refl  ect monetary policy changes in the form of expect-
ations regarding the future course of interest rates, for 
example (Gertler and Karadi (2015), Franz (2019), 
Jarociński and Karadi (2020)). Alternatively, a one- year 
interest rate could also be used here, or, instead of the 
EONIA rate, the yields on German government bonds. 
This changes the results of the estimations only slightly. 
In principle, shadow rates – i.e. counterfactual estima-
tions of the money market rate that would have oc-
curred without the zero lower bound – could also be 
used. However, these are associated with estimation 
uncertainty, which is not the case when using one- year 
or two- year market yields. Finally, the instrument vari-
ables described below are based on changes in two- 
year interest rates, and the use of equivalent yields in 
the VAR model improves instrument strength.
4 The VIX is often used to capture the uncertainty in 
the US and international fi  nancial markets that varies 
over time. It has been included here to control for such 
fl  uctuations econometrically.
5 All of the variables except for interest rates are in-
cluded in the model in logarithmic form. There is 
hardly any change in the results if the Bitcoin price or 
other fi  nancial market variables are included in the sys-
tem of equations in fi  rst differences.
6 Data on the market price of Bitcoin are available 
from as early as 2011. However, prior to mid- 2013, the 
market was small and dominated by a single trading 
platform (Mt. Gox). In addition, there is evidence to 
suggest that, before mid- 2013, the Bitcoin market was 
not effi   cient to the extent that daily returns were auto-
correlated to a somewhat large degree, see Urquhart 
(2016). Nevertheless, if mid- 2011 is chosen as the 
starting point for the analysis, there is hardly any 
change in the qualitative results; in quantitative terms, 
however, the effects are considerably smaller. The 
number of lags in the model is set as p = 8 , which cor-
responds to two months. However, the exact choice of 
p has hardly any impact on the results.Deutsche Bundesbank

alone is not suffi   cient to draw any conclu-
sions regarding which factors are the deter-
minants of each variable in the model. For 
example, if an unexpected (in model terms) 
downward deviation in the monetary policy 
rate – i.e. a negative residual – coincides 
with a subsequent unexpected upward de-
viation in fi  nancial market prices, this is not 
necessarily indicative of a causal relation-
ship. Mathematically, the problem lies in the 
fact that the estimated residuals are correl-
ated with one another. Intuitively, all pos-
sible determinants are drivers of both asset 
prices and monetary policy adjustments.To be able to draw any conclusions regard-
ing causality in the impact of monetary pol-
icy, we must isolate the component of the 
unexplained change in interest rates that 
does not represent a monetary policy re-
sponse to other determinants, but instead 
constitutes its own exogenous impulse 
(structural shock). Over the course of time, 
the economic literature has developed a 
number of approaches for this purpose. 
These differ mainly in terms of which add-
itional assumptions need to be made in 
order to identify individual structural 
shocks.7 Proxy VAR models, for example, 
draw on information from outside the 
model itself in the form of instrumental 
variables.
A suitable instrument would be correlated 
with the shock to be identifi  ed, but not 
with other potential structural shocks. In 
most cases, the changes in short- term inter-
est rates in narrow time windows around 
monetary policy decisions are used as in-
struments, as these are likely to be driven 
by monetary policy communication above 
all. However, in recent years, the economic 
literature has documented that the re-
sponse of share prices, for instance, does 
not always seem to be in line with these 
changes in interest rates, which, according 
to theoretical considerations, were caused 
by a monetary policy shock. This phenom-
enon is usually explained in that the change 
7 In the past, assumptions were often made regarding 
the time lags with which the individual variables re-
spond to shocks. The individual shocks were then able 
to be identifi  ed by specifying a sequence of variables 
and subsequently decomposing the variance- 
covariance matrix of the residuals in triangular form. 
However, this approach is poorly suited to models that 
include fi  nancial market variables in particular. Another 
widely used approach for identifying shocks is based 
on sign restrictions imposed on the shocks. However, 
these must be derived from theoretical considerations, 
and it is often necessary to make a large number of as-
sumptions in order to clearly differentiate individual 
shocks from one another. A detailed overview of pro-
cedures for identifying shocks can be found, for ex-
ample, in Kilian and Lütkepohl (2017).Impulse response functions to an

in interest rates by the central bank is some-
times interpreted as a signal of future eco-
nomic developments – an information 
shock.8 In order to fi  lter out these non- 
monetary shocks, the instrument in the 
model described here takes account not 
only of the interest rate responses around 
monetary policy decisions, but also of the 
responses of share prices.9
Once the monetary policy shock is identi-
fi  ed using the instrument, impulse response 
functions can be calculated. These show 
how a monetary policy impulse from the 
Eurosystem affects the individual variables 
in the system over time. In the chart on 
p. 80, the response of the price of Bitcoin in 
US dollars to a reduction in the two- year 
interest rate by ten basis points is compared 
with the responses of share prices and the 
exchange rate. In this context, the bands 
provide information on the statistical uncer-
tainty of the estimation results. All three 
market prices rise to a statistically signifi  cant 
degree before the monetary policy effect 
diminishes again over time. Here, the per-
centage rise in the price of Bitcoin is far 
larger than the percentage rises in the ex-
change rate and the share price index. If, 
however, as shown in the chart on p. 73, 
account is taken of the high volatility of the 
Bitcoin price – which is four times higher 
than that of the share price index and eight 
times higher than that of the exchange 
rate – the relative effects of the monetary 
policy impulse are fairly similar in magni-
tude for all three asset prices.
To better assess the signifi  cance of monet-
ary policy in each case, it is a good idea to 
decompose the forecast error variance. In 
this way, it is possible to estimate the extent 
to which, on average, the unexplained vari-
ations in the individual variables can be at-
tributed to the identifi  ed monetary policy 
shock. Such an exercise reveals that only around 8% of the fl  uctuations in the Bitcoin 
price can be explained by monetary policy 
impulses from the Eurosystem. This is some-
what less than for the euro/ US dollar ex-
change rate (around 12%) and considerably 
less than for the EURO STOXX 50 (around 
28%), but also associated with less uncer-
tainty.
The impression that monetary policy im-
pulses only have a moderate impact on the 
market movements of crypto tokens does 
not change when the analysis is expanded. 
For instance, the prices of Litecoin and 
Ether respond similarly to the identifi  ed 
8 For example, if interest rates were lowered, this 
could be interpreted as the central bank having a more 
pessimistic assessment of the economic outlook than it 
had before. As share prices are a refl  ection of expected 
corporate earnings, which respond sensitively to over-
all economic conditions, a reduction in interest rates 
could therefore lead to a drop in share prices. See 
Melosi (2017), Nakamura and Steinsson (2018), Cieslak 
and Schrimpf (2019), Kerssenfi  scher (2019), Jarociński 
and Karadi (2020) and Miranda- Agrippino and Ricco 
(2021). For an analysis of how such information shocks 
impact exchange rates, see Franz (2020).
9 These data are taken from the database in Altavilla 
et al. (2019). Using matrix rotation, an instrument ser-
ies is created based on the short- term changes in inter-
est rates and share prices. This then captures the ad-
justments resulting from a monetary policy shock 
where the signs of the responses of interest rates and 
share prices differ according to theory.* Forecast error variance decomposition over a one-week hori-

monetary policy shock.10 In fact, in these 
cases, monetary policy explains an even 
slightly smaller component of the forecast 
error variance. Non- standard monetary pol-
icy likewise plays a similarly signifi  cant role 
in the valuation of crypto tokens. For ex-
ample, in the analysis described above, the 
two- year interest rates could be replaced 
with ten- year interest rates; this would 
identify a shock that primarily captures the 
Eurosystem asset purchase programmes, 
which mainly affect longer- term interest 
rates. In this case, too, the monetary policy 
impulse explains a just slightly larger com-
ponent of the variation in the Bitcoin price 
(and also the variation in the euro/ US dollar 
exchange rate).11
Finally, the question could be raised of 
whether the prices of crypto tokens are 
driven not primarily by the monetary policy 
of the Eurosystem, but instead by that of 
the US Federal Reserve. This can also be in-
vestigated using the model described here 
by replacing each of the euro area variables 
with their US counterparts.12 Interestingly, a 
model estimated in this way comes to an 
entirely different conclusion in qualitative 
terms. In this case, a monetary policy im-
pulse from the Federal Reserve does not 
cause the prices of crypto tokens and other 
assets to respond in the same direction at 
all. For example, whilst an easing of monet-
ary policy in the United States would lead to 
rises in the prices of US shares and foreign 
currency, the market value of Bitcoin would 
not also rise, but instead fall. While the rea-
son behind this response cannot be given 
defi  nitively, it may, however, be linked to 
the especially pronounced spillover effects 
from US monetary policy in conjunction 
with the technological and institutional par-
ticularities of Bitcoin.13 Nevertheless, irre-
spective of the exact reason for the qualita-
tive response, monetary policy shocks from 
the Federal Reserve can likewise explain just a relatively small component of the price 
fl  uctuations.
10 In the model, the Bitcoin price is then replaced by 
the price of Litecoin or Ether respectively, and the sam-
ple period is adjusted accordingly.
11 A shock identifi  ed in this manner is, however, not 
necessarily orthogonal to the previously observed 
shocks from more standard monetary policy at the 
short end of the yield curve. The components of the 
forecast error variance explained in each case there-
fore cannot simply be added together to obtain a pic-
ture of the overall impact of monetary policy.
12 The short- term responses of interest rates and 
share prices, which are necessary for the construction 
of the instrument, have been taken from the database 
of Cieslak and Schrimpf (2019) for the model for the 
United States.
13 Karau (2021) fi  nds evidence that the rising demand 
for Bitcoin as a result of monetary policy tightening by 
the Federal Reserve is especially pronounced in emer-
ging market economies. The literature shows that 
these countries are particularly affected by rises in US 
interest rates (see Miranda- Agrippino and Rey (2020) 
and Degasperi et al. (2020)), for example due to shifts 
in capital by international investors and globally active 
banks (see Bruno and Shin (2015) and Kalemli- Özcan 
(2019)). Accordingly, if the economic and fi  nancial 
conditions in those countries deteriorate, this could 
boost demand for assets like crypto tokens, which, un-
like the normal fi  nancial system, are subject to hardly 
any regulation in those jurisdictions and can be easily 
transferred across national borders.Deutsche Bundesbank

nounced that they would accept Bitcoin as a 
means of payment for their products or that 
they intended to invest in Bitcoin themselves. 
There is also evidence to suggest that market 
prices often respond sensitively to announce -
ments made by supervisory authorities indicat -
ing regulatory changes for tokens.31
The assessment that the Eurosystem’s monet -
ary policy cannot sufficiently explain token 
price developments does not change when 
looking at non- standard measures either. For 
example, Eurosystem central banks purchase 
large amounts of bonds as part of various asset 
purchase programmes and thereby exert pres -
sure on long-  term interest rates.32 It is some -
times argued that it is these non-  standard 
measures in particular that are partly respon -
sible for the high valuation of various assets.33 
The effects of this policy can be investigated 
using the approach described here by including 
the yields of long- term government bonds in 
the VAR model. Changes to these long- term 
interest rates within narrow time windows 
around monetary policy announcements are 
thus used as instrumental variables in order to 
identify non- standard monetary policy im -
pulses. The results provide a similar picture to 
the one before: a decline in yields on ten- year 
German government bonds attributable to 
monetary policy causes a statistically significant 
increase in the Bitcoin price; the quantitative 
effect of this is small, however, and it can only 
explain a moderate portion of the overall fluc -
tuations.
Conclusion
Monetary policy impulses have a significant ef -
fect on the prices of many assets. While their 
impact on bonds, shares or exchange rates has 
been studied extensively on both a theoretical 
and empirical level, their relationship with 
crypto tokens such as Bitcoin is less obvious at 
first. Nevertheless, the higher valuation levels of individual tokens are sometimes perceived as 
excessive speculation, which has occasionally 
been blamed partly on the more accommoda -
tive monetary policies of major central banks.
Should the prices of Bitcoin and other similarly 
designed tokens primarily be driven by more 
accommodative monetary policy or reflect, for 
instance, the fears of supposed inflationary 
pressures, they might respond sensitively to 
monetary policy impulses. Indeed, the already 
pronounced volatility of token prices does tend 
to be higher around monetary policy an -
nouncements made by the ECB’s Governing 
Council than at other times. Likewise, the prices 
of tokens correlate somewhat more strongly 
with those of shares and exchange rates in im -
mediate response to the Eurosystem’s monet -
ary policy communication. That said, the rela -
tive significance of monetary policy in the euro 
area does not appear to be greater at first 
glance, but instead it generally seems to be 
lower and less statistically significant than for 
conventional assets.
A similar picture emerges following a system -
atic analysis over longer periods. When econo -
metric methods are used to identify Eurosystem 
monetary policy impulses, there is evidence to 
suggest that monetary policy has a significant 
effect on the price of Bitcoin, for example. 
However, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
can only explain a relatively minor part of the 
overall evolution in Bitcoin’s value, and most of 
this development has to be attributed to other 
determinants. Based on historical data, it thus 
cannot be deduced that, on account of their 
characteristics, the prices of crypto tokens are 
driven by monetary policy to any exceptional 
extent.Similar results

The performance of German credit 
institutions  in 2020
The coronavirus pandemic and the containment measures taken in response caused a severe 
economic  crisis that took its toll on the performance of German credit institutions, too, in 2020. 
Virtually all of the categories of banks included in the statistics on banks’ profit and loss accounts 
recorded either stagnating or receding results for the financial year before tax compared with the 
previous year. This was primarily due to a clear deterioration in results from the valuation of 
assets compared with 2019. The surge in risk provisioning in credit business in particular pushed 
up net valuation charges to €13.3 billion in 2020 – almost twice as much as in 2019. At the same 
time, operating income went up by only €1.8 billion (+1.5%) to €120.5 billion, and administrative 
spending fell by a mere €3.1 billion (-3.5%) to €87.0 billion.
The rise in operating income in 2020 was predominantly attributable to a €1.2 billion (+47.2%) 
increase in the other operating result and a €1.0 billion (+42.3%) improvement in the trading 
result. Furthermore, an increase of €0.9 billion (+2.8%) in net commission income helped to 
stabilise  operating income. By contrast, net interest income fell again slightly in 2020, this time by 
€1.3 billion (-1.6%). However, this decline was around two- thirds lower than in 2019 as German 
credit institutions were able to largely compensate for the decline in interest income in 2020 with 
lower interest expenditure.
Aggregated across all banks, the profit for the financial year before tax amounted to €14.3 bil -
lion in 2020 – coming in below the long- term average of €17.6 billion and significantly lower than 
the average of the post- financial crisis years (2010 to 2018) of €25.4 billion. Nevertheless, this 
constituted a sharp year- on- year rise of €8.6 billion (+153.0%), attributable almost exclusively to 
big banks. Yet, this increase did not reflect a general improvement in profitability for this category 
of banks but was instead almost exclusively due to the absence of a one- off effect that weighed 
heavily on big banks’ results for the 2019 financial year. Once this effect ceased to apply, the 
negative balance in the other and extraordinary account contracted by €10.3 billion to €5.8 bil -
lion overall and became the dominant factor driving year- on- year developments in the result for 
the financial year.
While the current year is showing signs of economic recovery, and additional credit risks have not 
yet materialised due to considerable fiscal support measures, uncertainty about the future course 
of the coronavirus pandemic continues to harbour risk for banks’ profitability. The persistence of 
the low interest rate phase is likely to strain profitability even further.Deutsche Bundesbank

Business environment and 
structural developments in 
the German banking sector
Against the backdrop of the coronavirus pan -
demic, in 2020 German credit institutions faced 
a market environment that was suffering a 
severe   economic crisis, affecting not only 
German  banks’ profitability but also the struc -
ture of both their balance sheets and business 
operations.
Macroeconomic setting
In spring 2020, the coronavirus pandemic and 
the containment measures taken in response 
caused a macroeconomic contraction of a 
magnitude and speed unprecedented in Ger -
man post- war history. Averaged across 2020, 
the German economy shrank by almost 5% on 
the year – a rate similar to that recorded during 
the global financial crisis in 2009.1
The coronavirus pandemic primarily affected 
the real economy. As a result of contact restric -
tions, services sectors with high frequencies of 
interpersonal contact, in particular, were re -
quired to severely restrict or entirely suspend 
their business operations. Furthermore, supply 
chains were disrupted, especially following the 
first wave of infections in spring 2020, and the 
export- oriented industry suffered as a result of 
falling foreign sales. Macroeconomic develop -
ment was stunted by a cutback in investment 
by enterprises and a massive reduction in 
household consumption.2
The crisis also had a dramatic impact on bond 
and equity markets. At the end of the first 
quarter of 2020, prices on European and Ger -
man equity markets plummeted across the 
board. After a period of sharp recovery lasting 
into the summer, prices tumbled again as of 
September 2020 on the back of major uncer -
tainty regarding how the pandemic would un -
fold. However, they rebounded significantly to -wards the end of the year following the suc -
cessful development of vaccines.
On the bond markets, yields on Bunds initially 
fell hard and fast. Investors were attracted by 
their role as a safe haven. Following the Euro -
system’s decision to implement the pandemic 
emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and 
various fiscal support measures, yields re -
covered again, only to fall as the year pro -
gressed. The impact of both the pandemic and 
the Eurosystem’s emergency monetary policy 
measures caused the yield curve derived from 
the yields on Federal securities to shift down -
wards overall during the period under review.
Extensive fiscal policy measures, such as ex -
panded short- time working benefits, govern -
ment loan guarantees and compensation for 
lost revenue, prevented a wave of private and 
corporate insolvencies.3 In addition, legislation 
was passed amending the bank regulatory 
framework, and other planned regulations 
were adopted ahead of schedule. This, for one, 
broadened the scope for banking supervision. 
For example, supervisors encouraged banks to 
use their capital and liquidity buffers if neces -
sary in order to maintain the flow of lending. 
They also lowered the countercyclical capital 
buffer to 0%. Arrangements permitting general 
payment moratoria ensured that a credit mora -
torium did not automatically mean banks had 
higher capital requirements for the affected 
credit amounts. Together with the increased 
levels of equity and liquidity held by German 
credit institutions since the global financial cri -
sis of 2009, these measures prevented the real 
economic crisis from spilling over to the finan -
cial sector. There were no major defaults on 
loans and banks were able to continue lend -

Methodological notes
Data based on individual accounts 
prepared  in accordance with the 
German  Commercial Code and on 
monthly balance sheet statistics
The results from the profi  t and loss ac-
counts are based on the published annual 
reports of the individual institutions in ac-
cordance with the provisions set forth in 
the German Commercial Code ( Handels-
gesetzbuch, or HGB) and the Regulation on 
the Accounting of Credit Institutions (Ver-
ordnung über die Rechnungslegung der 
Kreditinstitute, or RechKredV). In terms of 
their conception, structure and defi  nitions, 
they differ from the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS)1 for publicly 
traded banking groups. This means that 
– from a methodological viewpoint – busi-
ness performance and certain balance sheet 
or individual profi  t and loss items are not 
comparable across the national and inter-
national accounting frameworks. For rea-
sons of comparability within Germany, it is 
advisable to consider the individual ac-
counts when analysing fi  nancial perform-
ance. The fi  gures for balance sheet capital 
(total equity), total assets and other stock 
variables are not obtained from the annual 
reports but are taken as annual average val-
ues on the basis of the monthly balance 
sheet statistics reported for the institution 
as a whole.
Reporting group
The reporting group for statistics on banks’ 
profi  t and loss accounts (profi  t and loss 
statistics) includes all banks that are monet-
ary fi  nancial institutions (MFIs) which con-
form to the defi  nition of a CRR credit insti-
tution as set forth in Article 4(1) number 1 
of Regulation (EU) No  575/ 2013 and are domiciled in Germany. Branches of foreign 
banks that are exempted from the provi-
sions of Section 53 of the German Banking 
Act (Kreditwesengesetz, or KWG), banks in 
liquidation and banks with a fi  nancial year 
of less than 12 months (truncated fi  nancial 
year) are not included in this performance 
analysis.
Calculation of the long- term average
At the launch of monetary union in 1999, 
the reporting group relevant for calculating 
the money supply and for monetary analy-
sis was uniformly defi  ned by the ECB for the 
euro area as a whole and designated as the 
monetary fi  nancial institutions (MFI) sector. 
Unlike the population of banks used for the 
Bundesbank analysis up to that point, build-
ing and loan associations are also included. 
Except where another time period is expli-
citly mentioned, the calculations with re-
gard to the longer- term average cover the 
years since the launch of monetary union, 
i.e. from 1999 to 2020.
1 IFRS- based fi  nancial statements are of relevance, for 
instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and 
oversight concentrating on systemically important 
banks and their international business activities 
(including their foreign subsidiaries). For details, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2013).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2021

At the outbreak of the pandemic, the Eurosys -
tem adopted extensive non- standard measures 
which were modified again and again as the 
pandemic progressed. These measures were 
designed to ensure an ample supply of liquidity 
to banks and, ultimately, an adequate supply of 
credit to the real economy. To this end, it in -
creased purchases under the asset purchase 
programme (APP), which had been running 
since 2015, and launched the PEPP . A large vol -
ume of bonds issued by euro area Member 
States was purchased under these programmes. 
Furthermore, the Eurosystem introduced a ser -
ies of pandemic emergency longer-  term refi -
nancing operations (PELTROs), made conditions 
for the third series of targeted longer- term refi -
nancing operations (TLTRO- III) more favourable 
and adopted temporary collateral easing meas -
ures.5 Although the interest rate on the deposit 
facility remained negative, banks’ interest ex -
penditure was reduced by the two- tier system 
for remunerating reserve holdings introduced 
at the end of 2019, which makes a portion of 
excess liquidity held in the deposit facility ex -
empt from negative interest.6
Structural developments in the 
German banking sector
Growth in the aggregate of German credit in -
stitutions’ annual average total assets was 
again up significantly on the previous year. In 
addition to the persistent low interest rate en -
vironment, monetary and fiscal policy measures 
connected to the coronavirus pandemic are 
likely to have been a contributory factor here. 
Following an increase of 5.1% in 2019, German 
credit institutions recorded growth of €674.1 
billion (+7.9%) in their balance sheets.
Looking at the individual categories of banks, 
big banks recorded the highest year- on- year 
growth figures with a rise of just under €274 
billion (+11.1%). However, one- off effects were 
at play here: one institution merged with a 
group subsidiary that was not previously classi -
fied as a big bank, thus overstating actual de -velopments. Average growth in credit coopera -
tives’ and savings banks’ total assets (+7.5% 
and +7.0%, respectively) was in line with the 
aggregate.
On the assets side of the aggregated bank bal -
ance sheet, lending within Germany shot up 
again in 2020. According to data from the 
monthly balance sheet statistics, on an annual 
average, the volume of loans to domestic non- 
banks was up by around €144 billion (+4.2%) 
on 2019.7 Credit cooperatives’ contribution 
(approximately 28%) to overall growth in the 
volume of loans was disproportionately higher 
than their market share (20%). By contrast, sav -
ings banks’ and big banks’ shares in growth in 
lending (circa 32% and 11%, respectively) were 
more or less in line with their market share.
Distinct growth was recorded, in particular, for 
medium and long- term loans to domestic non- 
financial corporations and households. In 2020, 
they rose by around €137 billion (+5.3%) on an 
annual average; the highest jump seen in the 
last 20 years. Growth was chiefly driven by 
housing loans, which rose by around €87 bil -
lion (+6.1%) in 2020 – another 20-  year record 
high.
Factors on both the supply and the demand 
side were behind this growth. For instance, ro -
bust activity in the construction sector as well 
as a continuation of favourable financing costs 
probably fuelled persistently brisk demand for 
housing loans.8 Greater demand for medium 
and long- term loans to non- financial corpor -
ations also boosted growth considerably. This 
rise in demand was probably due to greater 
funding needs for refinancing, restructuring 
and renegotiation as well as high financing 
needs for inventories and working capital as a Easing of mon -

in 2020 was down on the previous year. On an annual 
average, the volume of loans fell by just under €28 billion 
(-2.1%).

result of the pandemic.9 In addition, a further 
easing of Eurosystem monetary policy and 
changes in the design of TLTRO- III is likely to 
have alleviated pressure on earnings, enabling 
banks to significantly increase lending.10
Unlike medium and long-  term loans, short-  
term loans to non- financial corporations and 
households remained at the previous year’s 
level on average over the reporting year, after 
having recorded high growth between 2017 
and 2019.
With a rise of just over €225 billion (+42.4%), 
German banks’ annual average holdings at 
central banks shot up in 2020. On an annual 
average in 2020, German banks thus set a new 
record, holding around €758 billion of their 
assets in central bank balances. The categories 
of banks contributing the most to this overall 
rise were regional and other commercial banks 
(growth of just over €62 billion, +61.8%), sav -
ings banks (growth of just over €52 billion, +88.2%) and credit cooperatives (growth of 
just under €19 billion, +75.4%). By contrast, 
big banks made only a moderate contribution 
(growth of just under €17 billion, +15.2%) to 
the rise in central bank balances. The Eurosys -
tem’s asset purchase programmes (PEPP , PSPP) 
and the extremely attractive conditions for

all domestic non- banks,13 with their annual 
average volume rising by a total of just under 
€177 billion (+4.9%) in 2020; the year before, 
the increase stood at 4.0%. Growth concen -
trated on sight deposits which expanded at a 
rate of 10.7% in the reporting year, much more 
than in 2019 (+7.7%). However, time and sav -
ings deposits were down on 2019, by 3.9% 
and 2.9%, respectively. This development re -
flects, on the one hand, a shift in deposit 
 customers’ preferences in favour of liquidity 
during the pandemic. On the other hand, the 
extremely narrow yield spreads between the 
various forms of deposit are likely to have 
played a part in this development, too.14
A comparison across categories of banks shows 
that, in proportion to their market share, sav -
ings banks and credit cooperatives in particular 
recorded somewhat disproportionately higher 
inflows of deposits. With an annual average in -
crease of roughly €62 billion (+6.3%), savings 
banks accounted for around one- third of total 
growth in deposits. Their market share in the 
overall volume of domestic non- banks’ de -
posits amounted to just under 28% in 2020. 
Credit cooperatives, with a market share of just 
under 20% (unchanged), reported a rise of 
about €45 billion (+6.4%), making up approxi -
mately 26% of the overall increase in domestic 
non- banks’ deposits. At around €16 billion 
(+2.4%), big banks’ contribution to deposit 
growth was, however, disproportionately low, 
accounting for around 9% of total growth and 
out of line with their market share of approxi -
mately 18%. Roughly 70% of total growth in 
domestic non- banks’ deposits can be attrib -
uted to these three categories of banks.
The balance sheet equity of German banks 
amounted to around €528 billion in total in 
2020 and was thus at more or less the same 
level as in 2019. However, broken down by cat -
egory of banks, the development is very het -
erogeneous. For instance, in the reporting year, 
big banks had around €20 billion (-19.5%) less 
equity than in 2019. Yet this decline is almost 
entirely attributable to losses reported by one institution which were actually incurred in 2019 
following strategic restructuring but not 
booked, and thus reflected in the equity fig -
ures, until 2020.15 By contrast, all other cat -
egories of banks16 considered recorded clear 
increases in balance sheet equity. Regional 
banks and other commercial banks (+9.5%), 
credit cooperatives (+5.8%) and savings banks 
(+4.5%) in particular topped up their balance 
sheet equity.
The consolidation process in the German bank -
ing sector continued in 2020. However, the de -
cline in the number of credit institutions was 
lower than in 2019 as fewer mergers took 
place in the reporting year, especially in the 
savings bank and credit cooperative sectors. In 
addition, not as many securities trading banks 
closed as in 2019 on account of Brexit.17
In contrast to the number of credit institutions, 
the number of branches in Germany fell much 
more sharply in 2020 than a year earlier. In 
general, the ongoing trend of thinning out the 
branch network affected every category of 
banks. However, in 2020, big banks in particu -
lar considerably cut the number of branches as 
part of extensive restructuring measures.18

in mind that the amounts transferred from the profit for 
the respective financial year do not increase balance sheet

while withdrawals from equity items are to be deducted at 
the latest when the annual accounts are prepared.

Performance, profitability 
and cost efficiency
Generally speaking, the performance of Ger -
man credit institutions deteriorated in 2020 
compared with the previous year. On account 
of the coronavirus pandemic, there was a sig -
nificant increase in risk provisioning in credit 
business, in particular, which led to virtually all 
of the categories of banks included in the stat -
istics on banks’ profit and loss accounts19 re-
cording either stagnating or receding results 
for the financial year before tax.
Nevertheless, the fact that the aggregate profit 
for the financial year before tax rose consider -
ably in the reporting year was primarily driven 
by big banks. There was a one- time sharp drop 
in the aggregate profit for the financial year in 
2019 on account of a one-  off effect resulting 
from strategic restructuring at one big bank. 
Once this one- off effect ceased to apply, there 
was an improvement not only in the aggregate 
profit for the financial year before tax, but also 
in the return on equity and the return on assets 
as well as the cost/ income ratio in the reporting 
year. Nevertheless, in 2020 the profit for the 
financial year before tax as well as the return 
on equity and the return on assets stood sig -
nificantly below the respective level of the 
long- term average and the average of the post- 
financial crisis years (2010 to 2018). The cost/  
income ratio also proved worse in the reporting 
year than the long- term comparative figures.
Return on equity and return 
on assets
Overall, the return on equity (profit for the 
financial year before tax in relation to balance 
sheet equity) more than doubled in 2020, 
going up by 1.6  percentage points to 2.7% 
compared with the previous year. However, the 
aforementioned one- off effect had an impact 
here. Accordingly, the distribution of the return 
on equity indicates that profitability deterior -
ated overall in the reporting year. In this vein, the median value20 declined significantly from 
4.4% in 2019 to 2.7% in 2020. In addition, the 
return on equity continued to stand consider -
ably below the long- term average of 5.2% as 
well as below the average of the post- financial 
crisis years (2010 to 2018) of just under 6%.
A comparison of the categories of banks shows 
that big banks were the main drivers of the 
seemingly positive development in 2020 as a 
whole. Because the one- off effect from the 
previous year ceased to apply, they posted the

19 Statistics on banks’ profit and loss accounts are com -
piled on an annual basis. This involves the evaluation of the 
profits and losses calculated from the annual accounts (in -
dividual accounts prepared in accordance with the German 
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) ), which the banks 
must submit to the Bundesbank pursuant to Section 26 of 
the Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz).  As the annual ac -
counts apply to the respective institution as a whole (but 
not to the group), the charges and income of foreign 
branches are also recorded. See also the methodological 
notes on p. 93.

biggest increase in the return on equity, at 
9.6 percentage points. Despite this, big banks 
also recorded the lowest return on equity of all 
categories of banks in the reporting year, at 
-7.1%. By contrast, credit cooperatives and sav -
ings banks remained among the categories of 
banks with the highest return on equity, at 
7.3% and 5.4%, respectively. In comparison 
with 2019, however, they recorded relatively 
sharp reductions in the return on equity of 1.9 
and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, owing 
to the surge in risk provisioning in credit busi -
ness in 2020.
Although the change in the profit for the finan -
cial year before tax proved to be the main 
driver of the development in the return on 
equity once again in 2020, in some categories 
of banks the change in balance sheet equity in 
comparison to the previous year was also ex -
ceptionally significant. For example, the in -
crease in balance sheet equity alone lowered 
the return on equity at credit cooperatives and savings banks by 0.4 and 0.3 percentage point, 
respectively, in comparison with the previous 
year. Thus, around one-  quarter of the decline 
in the return on equity at credit cooperatives 
and around 17% of the decline at savings 
banks were attributable to growth in balance 
sheet equity.
An analysis of the return on assets (profit for 
the financial year before tax in relation to an -
nual average total assets) painted a generally 
similar picture to the one for the return on 
equity. Increasing by just under 0.1 percentage 
point, the return on assets more than doubled 
in 2020 compared with the previous year, to 
0.16%. However, it remained considerably 
below the long- term average of 0.22% as well 
as below the average of the post- financial crisis 
years (2010 to 2018) of 0.29%. Here, too, the 
distribution of the return on assets indicates 
generally lower profitability than in 2019, with 
the median, in particular, declining from 0.21% 
to 0.15% in the reporting year compared with Change in return

the previous year. A comparison of the cat -
egories of banks likewise presents a similar pic -
ture to that of the return on equity. Apart from 
big banks, which were the main drivers of the 
overall development on account of the one- off 
effect from 2019 ceasing to apply, and mort -
gage banks, none of the other categories of 
banks21 were able to improve their return on 
assets. Credit cooperatives and savings banks, 
in particular, with figures of 0.16 and 0.15 per -
centage point, respectively, recorded sharp de -
clines in their return on assets in the reporting 
year compared with the previous year.
All in all, strong balance sheet growth (+7.9%) 
compared with the previous year curbed the in -
crease in the return on assets only slightly. Ex -
cluding balance sheet growth, the return on 
assets in 2020 would have been around 
0.01 percentage point higher, all other things 
being equal. In individual categories of banks, 
however, the impact on the change in the re -
turn on assets was significant. Balance sheet 
growth had a particularly strong influence on 
the return on assets at credit cooperatives and 
savings banks, with just under one- third of the 
reduction in credit cooperatives’ return on 
assets and around one-  fifth of the decline in 
savings banks’ return on assets in the reporting 
year attributable to balance sheet growth.
Profit for the financial year
The profit for the financial year before tax went 
up by a total of €8.6 billion in 2020 compared 
with the previous year. Although, at €14.3 bil -
lion, it reached a level of around 2.5 times that 
of the previous year, it remained below the 
long- term average of €17.6 billion and signifi -
cantly below the average of the post- financial 
crisis years (2010 to 2018) of €25.4 billion.
Looking at each category of banks individually 
shows that big banks were solely responsible 
for the surge in the profit for the financial year 
before tax. Although the merger between one 
big bank and a group subsidiary in 2020 en -cumbered the annual result of that category of 
banks, the one-  off effect resulting from stra -
tegic restructuring at one big bank in 2019 
ceasing to apply caused big banks’ annual re -
sult before tax to rise by €11.5 billion in the 
report ing year. This meant that the loss for the 
year before tax posted by big banks in 2020 
was considerably lower, at €6.0 billion, and 
thus stood at only one- third of the previous 
year’s figure. By contrast, with few excep -
tions,22 the other categories of banks recorded 
partly significant losses in 2020 compared to 
the previous year. Savings banks and credit co -
operatives recorded the largest absolute de -
clines, at €1.5 billion (-18.2%) and €1.2 billion 
(-15.5%), respectively. Nevertheless, together, 
savings banks and credit cooperatives also gen -
erated the lion’s share of the total profit for the 
financial year before tax in 2020, at €6.7 billion 
and €6.4 billion, respectively.
With an increase of €10.3 billion, the balance 
in the other and extraordinary account23 made 
the biggest contribution to growth in the over -
all profit for the financial year. In comparison to 
the previous year, the negative balance was re -
duced by almost two-  thirds in 2020, to €5.8 
billion. This extraordinarily strong improve -
ment, which also proved to be the dominant 
factor behind the rise in the aggregate return 
on equity and return on assets, was almost ex -
clusively driven by three one- off effects in the 
category of big banks. First, high loss allow -

one institution in 2019 led to big banks’ bal -
ance in the other and extraordinary account 
moving significantly further into negative terri -
tory, to €12.5 billion. These loss allowances did 
not reoccur in the reporting year. Second, the 
institution in question posted extraordinary in -
come of €1.3 billion in 2020 owing to its mer -
ger with a subsidiary which had hitherto been 
considered an independent institution in the 
category of big banks. Third, the merger be -
tween another big bank and a group subsidiary 
which did not previously belong to the cat -
egory of big banks led to new depreciation of 
and value adjustments to participating interests 
in the amount of €5.7 billion in the same 
period. Together, these three one- off effects re -
duced big banks’ negative balance in the other 
and extraordinary account by more than two-  
thirds compared with the previous year, to €3.4 
billion.
Compared with big banks, the changes to the 
balance in the other and extraordinary account in the other categories of banks24 were minor 
and had only a minimal impact on the negative

24 For example, regional banks and other commercial 
banks were able to reduce their negative balance in the 
other and extraordinary account by €1.1 billion (-36.1%) in 
the reporting year, to -€2.0 billion. Savings banks recorded 
a negative balance of around -€0.1 billion in the reporting 
year after posting a slightly positive balance in the other

ken expanded their negative balance by €0.2 billion 
(+42.9%), to €0.6 billion. Credit cooperatives remained at

Credit risk provisioning by German credit institutions 
in 2020
Given the impact of the coronavirus pan-
demic on economic activity in Germany and 
around the world, credit risk provisioning 
was a particularly important issue for Ger-
man credit institutions in the 2020 report-
ing year.
In the light of the comprehensive contain-
ment measures and the ensuing economic 
uncertainty, the need for greater credit risk 
provisioning became clear at an early stage. 
Model simulations warned of a signifi  cant 
increase in corporate insolvencies and thus 
also a considerable rise in loss allowance 
ratios.1
Supervisors and legislators took various 
measures to identify the risks associated 
with the coronavirus pandemic. For in-
stance, a special reporting system was 
estab lished early on. In order to ensure 
adequate  credit risk provisioning, over the 
course of the pandemic, banking super-
visors also explicitly communicated their ex-
pectations in terms of identifying and meas-
uring credit risk. In its “Dear CEO” letter of 
4 December 2020, the ECB outlined its ex-
pectations in this regard to the signifi  cant 
institutions under its supervision.2 The Fed-
eral Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) 
communicated a similar set of expectations 
to the less signifi  cant institutions (LSIs) in 
Germany.3 To support the functional viabil-
ity of the banking system during the crisis, 
in March and April 2020, institutions were 
also advised to make use of the fl  exibility of 
the existing accounting standards under 
IFRS accounting rules.4
Taking into account the measures outlined, 
aggregate net valuation charges rose sig-
nifi  cantly in 2020 from a fairly low level in 
the preceding years. However, an analysis 
by category of bank reveals differences in 
the scale of this development. For instance, 
in 2020, according to data from credit insti-tutions’ individual accounts prepared in ac-
cordance with the German Commercial 
Code, the net valuation charges of big 
banks rose to around €5.3 billion or 0.8% 
of the annual average lending portfolio. Re-
gional banks and other commercial banks 
likewise recorded a considerable increase in 
their net valuation charges to around €2.8 
billion or 0.5% of the annual average lend-
ing portfolio. By contrast, despite experien-
cing a rise in provisions in 2020 as well, net 
valuation charges at Landesbanken, savings 
banks and credit cooperatives climbed to 
€0.6 billion, €1.96 billion and €0.7 billion, 
respectively, which was fairly moderate by 
historical standards.
In the past, the formation and release of 
undisclosed reserves has sometimes also 
made a major contribution to the develop-
ment depicted in the chart on p. 104. How-
ever, undisclosed reserves are not only con-
sidered to be a risk provisioning tool; they 
are also used to shape the results.
Ultimately, economic activity, and thus the 
solvency of borrowers was more positive 
than feared in the second quarter of 2020, 
not least in the light of massive government 
support. The non- performing loans ratio in 
the German banking sector has not yet in-
creased over the course of the pandemic,

either. In the fi  rst quarter of 2021, it stood 
at just roughly 1.2%.5 Against this back-
ground, the increase in net valuation charges 
was smaller than in 2008 or 2009, for ex-
ample, in the wake of the fi  nancial crisis.
Moratoria were a measure to which par-
ticular attention was paid. For instance, the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) pub-
lished guidelines on general payment mora-
toria as early on as April 2020.6 Loans that 
met the requirements for general payment 
moratoria specifi  ed in the guidelines did not 
have to be classifi  ed as forborne, which 
could also have implied lower loss allow-
ances. At German credit institutions, the 
share of loans subject to moratoria in line 
with the EBA’s criteria temporarily reached 
0.4% (Q3 2020). However, German credit 
institutions granted forbearance independ-
ently of this option, too. The share of these 
other COVID- 19- related forbearance meas-
ures came to 0.6% in March 2021. Although 
these fi  gures seem small at fi  rst glance, a 
large part of the forbearance measures 
were granted to the sectors hit particularly 
hard by the pandemic. For instance, among 
the loans granted to the hotel and restaur-
ant sector by Germany’s signifi  cant institu-
tions,7 the share of loans subject to other 
COVID-19- related forbearance measures 
came to 21.5% in March 2021. Forbearance 
rates were also relatively high in the sectors “arts, entertainment and recreation” (4.5%), 
“administrative and support service activ-
ities” (4.0%), “transportation and storage” 
(3.0%) and “real estate activities” (2.9%).
The moratoria granted in line with the EBA’s 
criteria have now largely expired. At the 
end of March 2021, they stood at just 0.1% 
of the lending portfolio. No cliff effects 
occurred . Although residual risks exist with 
regard to the other COVID- 19- related for-
bearance measures that have not yet ex-
pired, they are limited because German 
credit institutions have made disproportion-
ately large loss allowances for them in com-
parison to total lending.
5 Based on supervisory reporting data (FINREP); the 
time series contains a structural break from the fi  rst to 
the second quarter of 2020 because the item “cash 
balances at central banks and other demand deposits” 
is now no longer to be included under loans and ad-
vances in FINREP . This, taken by itself, would already 
mean a rise in the ratio of non- performing loans. To 
isolate the effect of the pandemic as precisely as pos-
sible, the time series including “cash balances at cen-
tral banks and other demand deposits” has been ex-
trapolated for the purposes of this text.

cial year in 2020. With an increase of €6.6 bil -
lion, net valuation charges virtually doubled on 
the year to €13.3 billion, thus encumbering 
German banks’ profitability overall.
As a result of the pandemic, the valuation re -
sult deteriorated in all categories of banks. In 
particular, regional banks and other commer -
cial banks (+€1.8 billion) and savings banks 
(+€1.7 billion), but also credit cooperatives 
(+€1.2 billion) recorded significant increases in 
net valuation charges in 2020 compared with 
the previous year. This meant that, together, 
these three categories of banks were respon -
sible for just over 70% of the overall rise in 
2020.
Net valuation charges increased predominantly 
as a result of higher depreciation of and value 
adjustments to loans and advances, and provi -
sions for contingent liabilities and for commit -
ments, which rose by €4.9 billion on the year. 
A great deal of uncertainty about macroeco -
nomic developments alongside changed ex -
pectations regarding future credit defaults 
prompted German credit institutions to increase 
their risk provisioning in 2020.26 In addition, in -
come from value readjustments to loans and 
advances, and provisions for contingent liabilities 
and for commitments roughly halved in the re -
porting year overall (decline of €1.7 billion).27
Nevertheless, net valuation charges in the re -
porting year remained below their long- term 
average of €14.0 billion. During the global 
financial crisis in 2008, German credit institu -
tions’ net valuation charges were even almost 
three times higher than in 2020. The numerous 
fiscal policy and regulatory measures taken in 
response to the coronavirus pandemic are likely 
to have had a major risk- reducing impact and 
prevented credit defaults.
Although big banks also increased their risk 
provisioning in credit business against the back -
drop of the coronavirus pandemic, the rise in 
their net valuation charges in 2020, at €0.5 bil -
lion on the year, was comparatively small. This was, however, primarily driven by the negative 
one- off effect from the previous year ceasing 
to apply. Disregarding the institution affected 
by this, a significant rise in the net valuation 
charges of €3.3 billion compared with 2019 
could also be observed at the other big banks, 
which was primarily attributable to higher de -
preciation of and value adjustments to loans 
and advances, and provisions for contingent li -
abilities and for commitments. Measured in 
terms of their share of just under 30% in ag -
gregate total assets, the category of big banks 
also had a disproportionately large share in 
total net valuation charges28 in 2020, at just 
under 40%.Clear increase in

28 In the reporting year, savings banks’ share in total net 
valuation charges, at around 15%, was in line with their

German credit institutions’ operating business 
proved robust in 2020 despite the prolonged 
low interest rate environment and the corona -
virus pandemic. Operating income29 rose by 
€1.8 billion (+1.5%) on the year to €120.5 bil -
lion. However, this was only able to compen -
sate for just over one- quarter of the rise in net 
valuation charges.
With the exception of savings banks, whose 
operating income went down by €0.3 billion 
(-0.9%) compared with 2019, all categories of 
banks were able to raise their operating in -
come, at least slightly. Regional banks and 
other commercial banks recorded the largest 
increase compared with the previous year. With 
growth of €0.9 billion (+4.4%), they contrib -
uted around one- half of the overall rise.
The increase in operating income in 2020 was 
attributable to partly significant improvements 
in the net commission income, the trading re -
sult and the other operating result. However, this meant that, with the trading result and the 
other operating result, the sources of income 
that had the smallest shares in operating in -
come in 2020, at around 3% each, made the 
biggest individual contributions to the overall 
rise. Net commission income, which, at just 
under 27% of operating income, was the 
second most important source of income, ex -
perienced comparatively weak growth in the 
reporting year. Net interest income, which, ac -
counting for around 67% of operating income, 
remained German credit institutions’ most im -
portant source of income, went down again 
compared with 2019.
Net interest income is the only component of 
operating income that recorded a decline again 
in 2020. However, this decline, at €1.3 billion 
(-1.6%), was just over two- thirds smaller than 
in 2019. Total net interest income amounted to 
€81.1 billion in the reporting year.
A comparison of the categories of banks shows 
major differences in developments. For ex -
ample, in the reporting year, 81% of the total 
decline was attributable to big banks,30 al-
though they again generated less than one-  
fifth of the total net interest income. But sav -
ings banks and credit cooperatives also re -
corded declines. Savings banks’ net interest in -
come went down by €0.5 billion (-2.2%) in 
2020. Compared with the previous year, how -
ever, the decrease was around one- third 
smaller. By contrast, at €0.2 billion (-1.4%), the 
decline in credit cooperatives’ net interest in -
come doubled compared with 2019. Landes -
banken, in particular, recorded a rise in their 
net interest income. The increase of €0.3 billion 
(+5.4%) was, however, largely the result of a 
negative one- off effect at one Landesbank 
from the previous year ceasing to apply.Slightly improved

Change in German banks’ interest expenditure caused by 
adjustments to terms and conditions in deposit business 
with non- banks in the 2020 calendar year
The ECB introduced a negative interest rate on 
its deposit facility in 2014. Since then, German 
banks have been continuously reducing inter-
est rates on customer deposits. Non- fi  nancial 
corporations’ deposits were remunerated 
negatively in 2020 to an even greater extent 
than in the previous years. Although average 
remuneration on households’ deposits re-
mained in positive territory in 2020, it likewise 
continued its downward slide.1 The intent of 
these adjustments to terms and conditions 
was to reduce institutions’ interest expend-
iture and thus ultimately contain the decline in 
interest margins in lending and deposit busi-
ness.2
The decrease in German banks’ interest ex-
penditure in deposit business with non- banks 
can be approximated using data on average 
interest rates and deposit holdings from the 
monthly balance sheet statistics of monetary 
fi  nancial institutions (MFIs) and the MFI inter-
est rate statistics. The total comprises changes 
in sight deposits, time deposits and savings 
deposits held by domestic households, non- 
fi  nancial corporations, other fi  nancial corpor-
ations, general government and non- profi  t in-
stitutions, as well as by non- MFI non- resident 
depositors.3 Given that, for some of these sec-
tors,4 no data on remuneration of deposits are 
collected for the MFI interest rate statistics, it 
is assumed that these deposits are remuner-
ated at the interest rate reported for non- 
fi  nancial corporations. In order to measure 
the year- on- year change in interest expend-
iture in the 2020 calendar year, German 
banks’ interest expenditure in deposit busi-
ness is fi  rst calculated for each of the two cal-
endar years, and then the difference is calcu-
lated. Interest expenditure for 2019 and 2020 
is calculated on the basis of monthly data, 
thereby taking into account intra- year changes 
in average interest rates on deposits as well as 
changes in deposit holdings.
The table on p. 108 summarises the results of 
the calculations. On the whole, interest ex-penditure in deposit business is likely to have 
decreased by around €1.3 billion between the 
end of 2019 and the end of 2020, with the 
 lion’s share of the reduction, at around €1.2 
billion, accounted for by residents’ deposit 
business; interest expenditure in business with 
non- resident depositors was reduced by just 
under €0.1 billion.
A comparison of individual deposit categories 
reveals signifi  cant differences. German banks 
reduced their interest expenditure for sight 
deposits and time deposits each by just under 
€0.6 billion over the observation horizon. On 
the other hand, interest expenditure for sav-
ings deposits, given that average interest rates 
remained positive, decreased by less than 
€0.2 billion. Around half (just over €0.6 bil-
lion) of the entire reduction in interest ex-
penditure was due to the introduction or ex-
pansion of negative interest rates on deposits.
The degree to which the reduction in interest 
expenditure is based on price and volume ef-
fects varies among the individual deposit cat-
egories. As regards sight deposits, for in-
stance, both effects played a role: average 
remu neration declined slightly in 2020 and 
deposit holdings went up. The increase in de-
posit volumes, in and of itself, pushed up 
interest expenditure on households’ sight 
deposits  owing to the positive remuneration 
of the deposits. Growth in holdings of sight 
deposits of non- fi  nancial corporations and the 
other sectors, on the other hand, reduced 
interest expenditure on account of negative 
interest rates. Holdings of households’ long-

3 Changes in terms and conditions in deposit business 
with other banks are omitted because income and 
charges offset one another within the German bank-
ing system. The balance of deposit business between 
German and foreign banks is so small as to be con-
sidered negligible.

term time deposits did not change on balance 
in 2020; the reduction in interest expenditure 
is attributable solely to falling interest rates in 
new business. With regard to the long- term 
time deposits of non- fi  nancial corporations 
and the other sectors, the reverse holds: with 
interest rates nearly constant overall and posi-
tive on average, deposit holdings fell consid-
erably, which indicates that a volume effect 
was the primary contributor to the drop in 
interest expenditure.
The fall of around €1.3 billion in interest ex-
penditure in deposit business more than off-
set the just under €1.0 billion in net interest 
expenditure caused by the negative interest 
rates on the deposit facility in the 2020 calen-
dar year. Here, the net interest expenditure 
from the negative interest on the deposit fa-
cility is the balance between the interest ex-
penditure from remuneration of excess liquid-
ity, less a reduction caused by the use of tier-
ing,5 introduced at the end of 2019, and inter-
est income from participation in the negatively 
remunerated third series of targeted longer- 
term refi  nancing operations (TLTRO- III).6
The calculation of the reduction in commer-
cial banks’ interest expenditure in deposit 
business presented here refl  ects only part of 
the impact of negative monetary policy inter-
est rates on banks’ net interest income. Left out are further impacts of negative interest 
rates on banks’ interest expenditure and inter-
est income as well as all other expenditure 
and income items, examples being on lending 
rates and volumes, net commission income 
and risk provisioning. These effects are, in 
some cases, indirectly a result of the impact of 
negative interest rates on economic develop-
ments, which in turn feeds back to banks’ ex-
penditure and income items. All impacts (dir-
ect and indirect on expenditure and income) 
would have to be looked at jointly in order to 
reach a conclusive assessment of the overall 
impact of negative interest rates on banks’ 
earnings position.
5 For more on remuneration of excess liquidity and the 
impact of tiering, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b), 
pp. 59 ff.
6 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021a), p. 70. In 2020, 
the Bundesbank generated just over €2.7 billion worth 
of interest income from (negative interest rates on) 
credit institutions’ deposits. This interest income accru-
ing to the central bank corresponds to commercial 
banks’ interest expenditure from the remuneration of 
excess liquidity less a reduction caused by the use of 
tiering. According to the Bundesbank’s Annual Report, 
this contrasts with interest expenditure by the central 
bank resulting from (negatively remunerated) refi  nan-
cing operations amounting to just under €1.8 billion. 
This was expenditure on TLTRO- III, which result in 
interest income for commercial banks. On balance, this 
results in banks’ aforementioned net interest expend-
iture of just under €1.0 billion.Change in interest expenditure* in existing deposit business with the

As a result of parallel developments in interest 
income and interest expenditure, the decline in 
net interest income in 2020 was considerably 
smaller than in the previous year. In the report -
ing year, unlike in 2019, German credit institu -
tions managed to almost completely offset the 
fall in interest income through lower interest 
expenditure. Interest income in the broader 
sense31 fell by €22.5 billion, while interest ex -
penditure simultaneously went down by €21.2 
billion. The fact that interest income in the 
broader sense ultimately recorded a somewhat 
greater fall on the year than interest expend -
iture was chiefly due to lower current income 
in 2020 from variable- yield securities, partici -
pating interests and shares in affiliated enter -
prises. In the year under review, current income 
fell by €1.6 billion (-21.4%), €1.0 billion of 
which was attributable to the lower current in -
come from variable- yield securities at one big 
bank. By contrast, over the same period, the 
decline in interest income in the narrower 
sense, at €21.1 billion, was slightly more than offset by the reduction in interest expenditure. 
Furthermore, this development could be seen 
not only in aggregate terms but also separately 
for nearly all categories of banks.32
In the reporting year, the persistent low interest 
rate environment again led to lower interest in -
come for German credit institutions. This was 
due not only to negative interest rates on ex -
cess liquidity in the Eurosystem’s deposit facil -
ity, but first and foremost to the continued de -
cline in interest rates in the high- volume lend -
ing business with households.33 As a conse -
quence, even the growth in the volume of 
lending business – particularly in the issuance Fall in interest

of new housing loans – was unable to halt the 
decline in interest income. Nevertheless, in 
2020, German banks made increasing use of 
instruments to lower their interest expenditure. 
This included the near full utilisation of exemp -
tion allowances, introduced at the end of 2019, 
for the negative deposit facility rate34 as well as 
the expanded use of refinancing operations 
with the Eurosystem at sometimes negative 
rates (in particular TLTRO- III). Furthermore, ex -
tensive changes to terms and conditions for 
customer deposit business (including the in -
creased passing on of negative interest rates35) 
contributed to the decrease in interest expend -
iture.36
After dipping below the 1% mark for the first 
time ever in 2019, the interest margin (net 
interest income in the broader sense in relation 
to annual average total assets) fell to a new 
low of 0.88% in the reporting year on account 
of both lower net interest income compared to 
the previous year as well as strong balance 
sheet growth. However, more than three-  
quarters of the 0.09 percentage point decline 
in the interest margin compared to 2019 was 
attributable to strong balance sheet growth in 
2020, while just 0.02 percentage point of the 
overall decline was attributable to lower net 
interest income.
The major impact of balance sheet growth on 
the development of the interest margin was 
also observable in a breakdown by category of 
banks, particularly in the case of savings banks 
and credit cooperatives. The interest margin for 
both of these categories of banks fell by 
0.14 percentage point in the reporting year to 
new historical lows. However, the increase in 
average total assets accounted for around 70% 
(0.10 percentage point) of the total decline in 
the interest margin at savings banks and for 
around 85% (0.12 percentage point) at credit 
cooperatives. Despite this, savings banks and 
credit cooperatives again recorded the highest 
interest margins among all categories of banks 
in 2020, with an interest margin of 1.47% and 
1.56% respectively. At 0.55%, the interest mar -gin at big banks was comparatively low, with 
balance sheet growth accounting for 60% of 
the overall decline here too.
Net commission income increased by €0.9 bil -
lion (+2.8%) on the year to €32.1 billion. How -
ever, this increase was roughly half of that in 
2019, when growth on the year amounted to 
€1.7 billion (+5.8%).
Developments in net commission income were 
very mixed in a comparison of the categories of 
banks. The largest contribution to the overall 
increase was made by regional banks and other 
commercial banks. Their net commission in -
come rose by €1.1 billion (+23.5%) in the year 
under review. The main driver here was the re -
location to Germany of some institutions’ busi -
ness units in the wake of Brexit. By contrast, 
savings banks and credit cooperatives both re -
corded only a slight rise of €0.2 billion (+2.4% 
and +3.8% respectively). Big banks even saw a 
decline in net commission income, which fell 
by €0.8 billion (-8.3%) on the year in 2020. 
However, this decline was primarily attributable 
to the merger of two institutions that had pre -
viously been taken into account as separate in -
stitutions in the big bank category. Excluding 
this one- off effect, net commission income at 
big banks would have risen by €0.2 billion 
(+2.65%) on the year.

35 According to the MFI interest rate statistics, the aggre -
gate interest rate on new overnight deposits from non-  
financial corporations stood at -0.09% in December 2020, 
compared with -0.06% in January 2020 and -0.05% in De -
cember 2019. The aggregate interest rate for new over -
night deposits from retail customers was virtually zero in 
December 2020 (previous year: 0.008%). Furthermore, the 
share of non- financial corporations’ overnight deposits 
subject to negative interest rates rose to just under 80% 
over the course of the reporting year. Over the same 
period, the share of households’ overnight deposits earn -
ing negative interest rose to around 40% (see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2012c), pp. 34 ff.).

vidual banks. Developments in 2020 were het -
erogeneous, not only across categories of 
banks, but also when looking at individual insti -
tutions within these categories. For example, 
numerous institutions among big banks, sav -
ings banks and credit cooperatives, but also re -
gional and other commercial banks, recorded 
significant growth in safe custody business and 
securities trade, with corresponding increases 
in commission income. Many were also able to 
increase their commission income on the back 
of higher lending or in the payments domain as 
a result of the pandemic- related rise in cashless 
payment volumes. On the other hand, how -
ever, regional and other commercial banks, for 
example, recorded lower commission income 
in the area of trade finance as a consequence 
of the coronavirus pandemic and trade dis -
putes.
Following a slight increase in 2019, the com -
mission margin (net commission income in rela -
tion to annual average total assets) fell by 
0.02 percentage point to 0.35% in 2020, bring -
ing it back to the level of its long- term average. 
However, the reason for this decline was strong 
balance sheet growth, which, when viewed in 
isolation, led to a fall in the commission margin 
of 0.03 percentage point. The higher net com -
mission income in the year under review man -
aged to push up the commission margin by a 
mere 0.01  percentage point, thus offsetting 
just one- third of the decline caused by balance 
sheet growth. This indicates that the increase 
in net commission income was primarily the re -
sult of higher transaction volumes rather than 
higher fees.
The result from the trading portfolio increased 
by €1.0 billion (+42.3%) on the year in 2020 
and thus made a similar sized contribution to 
that of net commission income to the overall 
increase in operating income. This increase was 
chiefly driven by income from derivatives busi -
ness at one big bank. At €3.5 billion, net trad -
ing income in the reporting year was back to 
the level of its long- term average after having Commission 
margin back at 
level of long- 
term average

fallen considerably in the previous year due to 
losses from derivatives at one big bank.
The trading result continued to be primarily 
relevant for big banks and Landesbanken. In 
the reporting year, these two categories of 
banks together again generated the lion’s share 
(just under 70%) of the overall trading result. 
However, in 2020 the trading result also grew 
in importance for regional and other commer -
cial banks. With an increase of €0.4 billion, it 
more than doubled here compared to 2019, 
though this was attributable to just a small 
number of institutions in this category of banks.
With growth of €1.2 billion (+47.2%), the other 
operating result37 in 2020 made the largest sin -
gle contribution to the increase in operating in -
come and was able to almost fully offset the 
decline in net interest income. In addition, the 
other operating result, at €3.7 billion, was 
again of similar importance to German credit 
institutions in the reporting year as the trading 
result. However, this increase was attributable 
almost solely to big banks. Their other operat -
ing result rose by €1.4 billion on the year, 
chiefly owing to changes in the value of non-  
trading derivatives at one big bank.
General administrative spending38 in 2020 fell 
by €3.1 billion (-3.5%) on the year to €87.0 bil -

quarters of the deterioration in the valuation 
result. Just under 90% of the overall decline 
was attributable to big banks, which reduced 
their general administrative spending by €2.8 
billion (-10.1%) compared to 2019. The main 
reason for this was lower spending on restruc -
turing and litigation at one big bank. This led to 
a fall in big banks’ other administrative spend -
ing in particular, which was down by €2.5 bil -
lion compared to 2019. In addition, through a 
reduction in headcount, big banks also man -
aged to reduce their staff costs by €0.3 billion 
in 2020.
The general administrative spending of the 
other categories of banks largely remained at 
the level of the previous year. In the reporting 
year, only savings banks were able to markedly 
reduce their general administrative spending, 
which was down €0.6 billion (-2.7%) compared 
to 2019. Of this, €0.2 billion was due to lower 
staff costs as a result of a reduction in head -count and €0.3 billion was due to the decline 
in other administrative spending.
Despite the ongoing consolidation process and 
further thinning out of the branch network, 
staff costs still accounted for roughly half of 
overall general administrative spending in 2020. 
Although staff costs declined slightly compared 
to 2019 (-€0.2 billion), their share in general 
administrative spending rose in the reporting 
year to 50.8% (+1.5  percentage points), as 
overall general administrative spending also de -
clined. Due to their staff- intensive business 
model with many branches throughout Ger -
many, savings banks and credit cooperatives 
continued to record the highest share of staff 
costs, at 62.2% and 57.3%, respectively.
Except for the aforementioned declines at big 
banks and savings banks, other administrative 
spending remained virtually unchanged on the 
year, at €42.8 billion in 2020. The reasons for 
the persistent high level were, inter alia, the In aggregate

continuing high expenditure on IT in the con -
text of the ongoing digitalisation process and 
against the backdrop of increased mobile work -
ing during the coronavirus pandemic. Further -
more, due to the strong growth in covered de -
posits40 in 2019, contributions by German insti -tutions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) rose 
by €0.2 billion to €2.23 billion.41
Cost efficiency
Measured by the cost/  income ratio under its 
broad definition (administrative spending rela -
tive to operating income), German credit insti -
tutions’ cost efficiency improved slightly overall 
in 2020. This was due to both the lower gen -
eral administrative spending and slightly higher 
operating income compared to the previous 
year. The cost/ income ratio in the reporting 
year fell by 3.7 percentage points to 72.3% and 
was thus nevertheless still well above the long- 
term average of 68.0% and above the average 
of the post- financial crisis years (2010 to 2018) 
of 68.4%. Somewhat less than one- third of the 
overall decline was attributable to the rise in 
operating income.
In a comparison of the categories of banks, big 
banks recorded the largest improvement in the 
cost/ income ratio, with a reduction of 10.6 per -
centage points compared to the previous year. 
This was primarily attributable to the decrease 
in other administrative spending at big banks. 
Nevertheless, despite the sharp fall, big banks 
continued to have the largest cost/ income ratio 
of all categories of banks in 2020, at 90.3%. 
Savings banks lowered their cost/  income ratio 
in the reporting year by 1.3 percentage points 
to 70.1%, despite their operating income falling 
slightly compared to 2019. In the year under re -
view, the cost/ income ratio of credit coopera -
tives remained unchanged compared to 2019, 
at 67.2%.Overall improve -

Outlook
The economy is currently experiencing robust 
growth following a downturn in the first quar -
ter of 2021, and gross domestic product (GDP) 
looks set to return to its pre- crisis level before 
the year is out. However, supply bottlenecks 
are slowing the recovery, particularly in indus -
try. Moreover, the further course of the pan -
demic and potentially necessary containment 
measures or trade barriers are leading to sig -
nificant uncertainty regarding economic devel -
opments.
In 2020, German credit institutions increased 
their risk provisioning in credit business, but the 
wave of credit defaults that had been feared 
did not materialise. Furthermore, credit quality 
is improving on the whole thanks to the eco -
nomic recovery. These aspects are likely to have 
a positive impact on profitability in 2021. 
Alongside the high level of uncertainty about 
the further course of the pandemic, the effects 
of expiring fiscal support measures may also af -
fect the risk situation of banks and savings 
banks, however.
In addition, the profitability of German institu -
tions will probably continue to be adversely af -fected in future by factors unrelated to the 
pandemic. For example, the expected continu -
ation of the period of low interest rates will 
continue to weigh on traditional interest busi -
ness and generate considerable pressure to 
utilise additional revenue sources and cut costs. 
Furthermore, it is difficult to gauge the specific 
impacts of the ruling by the Federal Court of 
Justice on 27  April 2021 regarding account 
management fees. The hitherto standard use 
of negative consent clauses that allow banks to 
change account management fees without 
seeking customers’ explicit consent has been 
declared null and void by the ruling.42 This 
means that more complicated procedures will 
be required for future changes.
In addition, investments in digitalisation will 
continue to pose a major challenge for the sec -
tor. The coronavirus pandemic has probably 
given a boost to existing and new digitalisation 
projects. At the same time, investments in de -
carbonising the economy are presenting banks 
with growth opportunities.Continued

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

an agreed maturity and all loans excluding revolving loans and overdrafts, credit card

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective
exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitive-
ness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more
detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the
Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1  The
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
