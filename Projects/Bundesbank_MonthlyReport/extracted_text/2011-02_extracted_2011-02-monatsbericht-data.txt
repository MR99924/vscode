6OverviewGerman economic recovery resumes
Having fallen sharply in the latter part of
2008 and early months of 2009, the worldeconomy subsequently rebounded swiftlyand strongly. The slowdown in global growthdynamics that emerged in the spring of 2010led to fears that this upturn could come to anabrupt halt. This did not happen, however.Instead, the global economy picked up speedagain in the fourth quarter of 2010. Industrialoutput increased perceptibly in October-No-vember compared to the third quarter. Ac-cording to the global purchasing managersindices, services have recently also been arelatively strong catalyst for growth. Strongermomentum in several emerging market econ-omies was the main factor driving the resur-gence in global activity. Among the advancedeconomies, however, the pace of growthslackened further in the final quarter of 2010,according to estimates. While momentumpicked up appreciably in the United States,which has thereby recently started to spear-head economic expansion among the indus-trial countries again and was the second G7country after Canada to surpass its pre-crisislevel of output, the seasonally adjusted rateof growth in the euro area was unchanged,while aggregate output declined in theUnited Kingdom and Japan.
Following the turn of 2010-11, global eco-
nomic momentum seems to have remainedelevated or even to have accelerated some-what. For instance, the global purchasingmanagers indices rose perceptibly again inJanuary. The Bundesbank’s leading indicatorfor the world economy has also displayed aGlobal

7clear upward trend again after dipping no-
ticeably in the second and third quarters of2010. The favourable global economic settingis, however, currently being accompanied byhigher energy and food inflation.
Developments on the international financial
markets were likewise influenced by thebrighter global economic outlook in the latterpart of 2010 and early part of 2011. Capitalmarket rates worldwide picked up amidgrowing confidence among market partici-pants in the United States, Japan and Ger-many, too. This was reflected inter alia in
higher yields on corporate bond markets. Onthe international stock markets, the reversalof previous safe-haven flows along with posi-tive earnings figures and improved earningsexpectations strongly boosted share prices onboth sides of the Atlantic; at the same time,investors’ uncertainty eased appreciably.
In addition, the sovereign debt crisis in several
peripheral euro-area countries continued tocast a shadow. Market participants had theirsights trained on Ireland which, given thelarge strain which the restructuring of its fi-nancial sector placed on its budget, acceptedassistance under the European rescue shieldat the end of November. The country’s riskpremiums on the capital market temporarilyclimbed to new highs, and burgeoning uncer-tainty also drove up the spreads of other per-ipheral countries. Caught between counter-vailing forces, the euro displayed no cleartrend.
Against this backdrop of robust overall eco-
nomic growth, albeit still characterised bycapacity underutilisation, and given muted
monetary and credit growth, the GoverningCouncil of the ECB concluded that inflation inthe euro area would remain in line with pricestability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. However, it stressed the needto monitor developments very closely, as sev-eral factors, in particular a continued upsurgeof commodity prices, might cause the risks toprice stability, which are currently still bal-anced, to move to the upside in the mediumterm. As a result, the Governing Council leftkey interest rates at their historically lowlevels.
The improvement in conditions on the euro
money market that began in the summercontinued over the winter months. After anoticeable increase at the beginning ofOctober, money market rates initially easedslightly until year-end. Following the firstmonetary policy meeting of the ECB’s Gov-erning Council in 2011, rates picked upsharply again, however. On balance, fromOctober to January money market ratestherefore remained on the upward path onwhich they had embarked in the secondquarter. This was largely because banks sig-nificantly reduced excess liquidity as the lastoutstanding six and twelve-month tendersexpired.
Monetary growth in the euro area weakened
perceptibly in the last quarter of 2010, afteraccelerating appreciably in the two precedingquarters. Among the counterparts of M3,lending by banks resident in the euro area todomestic non-banks was again a key driver ofmonetary expansion in the final quarter of

82010. Loans to non-financial corporations fell
distinctly, by contrast, after having recordedthe first clear growth in six quarters in thepreceding period.
The German economy continued its cyclical
recovery in the fourth quarter of 2010. Ac-cording to the flash estimate released bythe Federal Statistical Office, seasonally andcalendar-adjusted real gross domestic prod-uct rose by 0.4% quarter on quarter in thefinal three months of the year, thus displayingslightly weaker growth than in the summer.However, the result probably understates theunderlying economic momentum, as the ex-tremely cold and snowy winter weathercaused severe disruptions in the constructionand transport sectors in December. Therapid upturn of the last one-and-a-half yearsmeans the German economy is almost backat normal capacity utilisation levels, and insome areas of the economy capacity utilisa-tion already exceeds the longer-term aver-age.
One reason for the favourable overall eco-
nomic situation in Germany is the distinctlyoptimistic sentiment among businesses andconsumers, which has helped strengthen do-mestic growth stimuli. Businesses are invest-ing in new plant and equipment, raisingworking hours and hiring additional staff. Asa result, employees’ income is rising and thelabour market is improving, in turn boostinghouseholds’ propensity to purchase andthereby providing noticeable impetus to con-sumption as well as housing construction.The pronounced and broad-based cyclical ex-pansion of the German economy is also hav-ing a knock-on effect on its trading partners
– especially in the European Union – in theform of rising expenditure on imports. How-ever, the upturn continues to be fuelled chief-ly by buoyant demand for German industrialproducts, particularly from non-EU countries –as is to be expected in an economy as openas that of Germany. The present confidencein the German economy is largely based onthe expectation that this trend will continue.
Against this background, German economic
momentum was barely dented by the factthat in the fourth quarter exports probablygrew less strongly than before. The reducedexternal dynamics were largely the result ofstagnant sales to euro-area partner countries.By contrast, deliveries to non-euro-area coun-tries continued to expand.
Renewed strong growth in investment helped
offset the mixed figures for foreign demand.With many enterprises having reached or, insome cases, even exceeded their plants’ nor-mal capacity utilisation, they are increasinglylooking to capacity extensions. Constructioninvestment, too, would probably have sup-ported growth in the fourth quarter of 2010had the early onset of winter not considerablycurtailed output in December.
Nonetheless, the sharp cyclical upturn has
not yet led to accelerated lending to the cor-porate sector. A key reason for this is prob-ably that the upswing has provided non-financial corporations with better access toalternative sources of funding, notably includ-ing internally generated financial resources.

9Supply-side restrictions are unlikely to have
presented an obstacle to corporate funding.
Private consumption has emerged as another
driver of domestic demand. The moderate in-crease in the fourth quarter of 2010 is con-sistent with a slow but steady recovery ofconsumption. In the reporting period, retail-ers benefited in particular from households’willingness to spend during the Christmasbusiness.
The labour market recovery also continued in
the fourth quarter of 2010. Almost all sectorsof the economy are meanwhile experien-cing employment growth. Moreover, effect-ive working hours are now back at normallevels, or higher, for large swathes of indus-try. In manufacturing, the average number ofhours an employee worked in the fourthquarter of 2010 was no longer significantlyless than during the last cyclical high in thefirst quarter of 2008. According to leading in-dicators, the outlook for the labour marketremains very positive. Up to January 2011,the number of vacancies had increased fur-ther in seasonally adjusted terms.
However, the price climate in Germany has
deteriorated considerably. A major factor be-hind this was the surge in world market pricesfor energy, industrial commodities and foodin the wake of the global economic recovery,which was reflected in increased inflation, inparticular, at the upstream sales and produc-tion stages. This is largely the result of pricesreturning to pre-crisis levels, which – like therecovery in the real sector – is temporarilybeing accompanied by higher rates of price
increases.
The outlook for the German economy is posi-
tive. It should be able to carry over much ofthe economic momentum from the secondhalf of 2010 into the current year, as incom-ing orders from non-EU countries are verystrong. Exporters are benefiting from theirpresence on the strongly expanding non-European markets, particularly as the eco-nomic recovery in the United States has re-cently accelerated perceptibly. Impetus fromthe euro area is likely to stay fairly muted,however, and if orders from this region re-main weak, the pace of economic growthmight conceivably ease somewhat.
Private consumption, by contrast, is likely to
continue to support economic activity overthe next few months as consumers’ propen-sity to purchase is high, based notably onvery optimistic income expectations. Theirconfidence is grounded in the expectation ofan ongoing labour market revival and theprospect of a perceptible increase in pay.
Against this backdrop, public finances in Ger-
many developed more favourably last yearthan had been anticipated at the height ofthe crisis. The situation is also better than inmany other countries. However, this shouldnot mask the existence of substantial fiscalproblems and the need for large-scale adjust-ment. Public finances still had an expansion-ary bias in 2010. This, as well as the assist-ance provided to financial institutions, drovethe general government deficit ratio up to3.5%, although the buoyant economy and

10positive one-off effects significantly eased the
burden on public coffers. The debt ratioreached a new high, estimated at well over80%. The very sharp increase can mainly beattributed to measures to stabilise the finan-cial markets, which involved the governmentsector assuming liabilities – and risky assets –on a large scale.
The deficit ratio could drop perceptibly to-
wards 2% this year, provided all levels of gov-ernment start to initiate the deficit reductionnecessary, not least to comply with budgetaryrules, and there is no let-up in the plannedconsolidation measures. Despite the expectedreduction in the deficit, policymakers still facea huge restructuring task over the next fewyears, as is abundantly clear from central,state and local government budgets. Themedium-term objective of a structurallyclose-to-balance budget is still a long way off.The debt ratio has exceeded the 60% refer-ence value ever since 2002 and rose verysharply again during the crisis. The better per-formance in terms of national and Europeanbudgetary rules should therefore not be usedto ease consolidation efforts. On the con-trary, the current good economic conditionsrepresent an excellent opportunity for rapidand comprehensive budget consolidation.
Against this backdrop, the concrete imple-
mentation of the constitutional rules on thedebt brake in Germany to date continues tomerit a critical appraisal. For instance, thestarting level for the graduated reduction inthe maximum borrowing limit that must beachieved by 2016 has not been adjusted totake account of the more favourable macro-economic and fiscal outcome last year; in-
stead the much higher estimate of the sum-mer of 2010 has been used as the basis. Thisprovides additional scope for governmentborrowing, which is initially even higher thanunder the old constitutional rules, whichwere regarded as insufficient. To ensure com-pliance with the legislative intent of the newdebt brake and avoid violating it upon itsfirst-time application, thereby underminingconfidence in the effectiveness of the reform,the reduction path should be adjusted to the2010 outturn, which is now available. This isparticularly pertinent in the light of attemptsto establish the new German budgetary rulesas a model for ensuring sustainable public fi-nances in other euro-area countries.
Confidence in the soundness of public fi-
nances remains extremely strained in severaleuro-area countries, with Ireland, followingGreece, also forced to apply for financial as-sistance from the EU, other member statesand the IMF. Action will be required primarilyfrom the stricken countries themselves to im-prove this situation on a sustainable basis byeliminating the root causes of the problem.But financial assistance can at most buy timeto allow the necessary adjustment processesto be spread over a longer period. As thingscurrently stand, the euro rescue shield agreedin May 2010 would appear to provide a suffi-cient range of instruments.
Nonetheless, the possibility of adding new in-
struments to the rescue package, which runsto 2013, is currently being floated. One de-mand is that the European Financial StabilityFacility (EFSF) should buy up the government

11bonds of the affected countries on the sec-
ondary market. That would, however, ab-solve private creditors and national policy-makers of even more of their responsibilityand possibly result in the taxpayers in thecountries providing the finance having toshoulder more and potentially large-scalerisks. Bond buybacks by the country itselfusing low-cost loans extended by the EFSFare being proposed, as is the idea that bondsacquired by the EFSF cheaply should bepassed on to the debtor country below par.In economic terms, this would, like the reduc-tion of the agreed interest rate conditions, in-volve an additional intergovernmental trans-fer.
This is also an issue with the future European
Stability Mechanism (ESM). It is planned as alast resort to safeguard the stability of theeuro area if the preventive measure ofstrengthening the Stability and Growth Pact,the targeted expansion of an early warningsystem for serious macroeconomic imbal-
ances which could jeopardise other memberstates and improved financial market regula-tion prove insufficient. At the end of Novem-ber 2010, the euro-area finance ministersestablished important cornerstones for theESM, which the European Council confirmedin December. The ESM will accordingly bebased on the EFSF in its current form. Toprotect the taxpayer, ESM loans are, more-over, to be given preferred creditor status,amongst other things. At present, negoti-ations are ongoing with the objective of final-ising the mechanism by March. Some of theproposals being discussed – for example in-volving secondary market purchases, extend-ing joint liability (Eurobonds) or perceptiblylowering the interest rate charged on ESMloans – reduce incentives for sound fiscal pol-icy and contravene important basic principlesof the currency union such as subsidiarity, na-tional fiscal responsibility and the no bail-outprinciple.

European settingWorld economic activity
The global economy regained momentum in
the fourth quarter of 2010 after slowing per-ceptibly in the preceding two quarters. Indus-trial output in October-November saw quitestrong growth, of 1% after seasonal adjust-ment, compared with the summer quarter.According to the global purchasing managerindices, services have recently also been pro-viding a stronger boost. The acceleration ofgrowth in some emerging market economiesis the primary reason for the increased dyna-mism of expansion. According to estimatesbased on preliminary figures for the majoreconomies and the euro area, growth in realgross domestic product (GDP) among the ad-vanced economies, at just under +
1/2% after
seasonal adjustment, was somewhat slowerin the last quarter of 2010 than in the sum-mer. The total output of this group of coun-tries rose by 2
1/2% on average for 2010 as a
whole. Among the industrial countries, theUnited States has recently reassumed its sta-tus as the spearhead of economic growth. USreal GDP grew much more dynamically thanin the two preceding quarters, also surpass-ing, for the first time, its cyclical peak of end-2007. Canada was the only G7 country thatreturned to its pre-crisis level more quickly.Euro-area growth remained moderate in theautumn. By contrast, aggregate output in theUnited Kingdom and Japan was down on theprevious period.
After the turn of 2010-11, the pace of global
economic growth seems to have remainedelevated or even accelerated slightly. For in-stance, the global purchasing manager in-Global

13dices rose perceptibly again in January. The
Bundesbank’s leading indicator for the globaleconomy is likewise clearly pointing upwardsagain after dipping noticeably in the 2010Q2-Q3 period.
The favourable global economic develop-
ments are, however, currently being accom-panied by higher energy and food inflation.The price per barrel of Brent crude oil pickedup from US$80 in the last week of Septemberto US$92
1/2at the end of December. This was
attributable not only to the perceptible in-crease in demand from the emerging marketeconomies but also to the extremely inclem-ent winter weather in Europe and NorthAmerica, which caused inventories to shrinkperceptibly. On average over the final quarterof 2010, crude oil prices were up 15
1/2%o n
the year; denominated in euro, they in-creased by as much as one-quarter owing tothe euro’s depreciation. Crude oil pricesmaintained their steep ascent after the turnof 2010-11 and, at the end of January, sur-passed the US$100 mark for the first timesince September 2008. This was due mainlyto political unrest in Egypt, which, for onething, caused concern on the markets that oiltransportation via the Suez Canal might beinterrupted. For another, there are fears thatthe crisis could spill over to the oil-producingcountries in the Middle East. Not only spotprices but also forward prices rose sharply.World market prices for food, beverages andtobacco went up by 29% from the end ofSeptember to mid-February, especially owingto the impact of inclement weather.

14have also been playing a role. Industrial raw
materials prices likewise trended upwards, al-beit not quite as sharply (+9
1/4%). Overall, in
mid-February the HWWI non-energy com-modity price index, in US dollar terms, waswell above its July 2008 peak.
In the advanced economies, it was particular-
ly energy price hikes which impacted on theconsumer price index, whereas consumers inthe emerging market economies (EMEs) werehit chiefly by higher food prices. In the lightof these developments, monetary policy-makers in countries such as China and Indiahave tightened the reins in the past fewmonths, with further moves likely to follow.In the major industrial countries, however,where inflation expectations – with the ex-ception of the United Kingdom – remainedquite low throughout the reporting period,
policymakers continued to pursue a very ex-pansionary policy. In this group of countries,after the elimination of seasonal effects, con-sumer prices were up in the autumn by 1.1%on the period; year-on-year inflation grewfrom +1.3% in September to +1.8% in De-cember. Excluding energy and food, the rateof inflation in December, at 1.0%, was amere 0.2 percentage point above its Septem-ber level. The industrial countries as a wholeare not currently facing any immediate threatof inflation on the domestic front.
The recent rise in inflation has led the IMF to
increase its 2011 inflation forecast by 0.3 per-centage point to 1.6% for the advancedeconomies and by 0.8 percentage point to6.0% for the developing and emergingworld. Corrections have been made for 2012as well, albeit to a lesser extent. In addition,the October GDP forecast was once again re-vised upward; the current assessment nowshows last year’s world economic growth tohave been one-quarter percentage pointstronger, at 5.0%. The forecast for 2011 hasbeen increased to a similar degree, to 4.4%;the picture remains largely unchanged for2012. The revision for the past year is, aboveall, a reflection of unexpectedly strongsecond-half growth in the United States,Japan and Germany. For 2011, the IMF hasrevised its projection upward for the UnitedStates by no less than
3/4percentage point to
3.0%, with the forecast for Germany increas-ing slightly to 2.2%. Moreover, the projec-tions for Central and Eastern Europe and forLatin America have been adjusted upwards.World market prices for

15Real world trade grew by 12.0% in 2010 ac-
cording to the current estimate, and thus bymore than
1/2percentage point more strongly
than had been expected in autumn. The pro-jections for 2011 and 2012 have been in-creased slightly to 7.1% and 6.8% respective-ly. The IMF continues to see the downsideforecast risks as prevailing, particularly em-phasising the threat of financial contagionfrom euro-area peripheral countries to thecore countries in the event of a renewed in-tensification of the sovereign debt crisis.
Selected emerging market economiesMany south and east Asian EMEs have seen
economic activity rebound perceptibly after amore subdued phase in the summer months.As a case in point, real GDP in China, accord-ing to seasonal adjustment by the Bundes-bank, grew much more strongly than in thesummer quarter. The faster pace is probablyattributable, in particular, to a significant re-vival of exports, with domestic demand re-maining brisk. China’s average economic out-put for 2010 as a whole was up by 10
1/4%
from 2009. As in previous years, gross capitalformation made the greatest contribution togrowth. Nominal GDP increased to nearlyRMB 40 trillion (which translates to just underUS$6 trillion), surpassing Japan’s level at mar-ket exchange rates for the first time.
1The
trade surplus shrank by 61/2% to US$183 bil-
lion, particularly on account of higher importprices caused by sharply rising commodityprices. India’s economy, which in the summermonths saw real GDP grow by 10
1/2% on the
year, seems to have slowed down perceptiblyin the fourth quarter of the year, with year-on-year growth of industrial output falling
from 9% in the third quarter to 5
1/4%. Sur-
veys show, though, that manufacturing en-terprises remain very optimistic about thefuture.
In most of the EMEs in the region, the consid-
erable hike in food prices has led to a signifi-cant increase in consumer price inflation.China’s annual inflation rate rose from 3.6%in September to 4.9% in January. In India,however, it was, at 9.5%, visibly lower at theend of the year than on average over thesummer months owing to a base effect.
In the major Latin American countries, the
economic upturn progressed very quickly inautumn. One contributory factor in Brazil wasthe robust growth in domestic demand,driven mainly by a continued strong rise in la-bour income. Whereas the services sector ap-parently grew perceptibly throughout the re-porting period, industrial output has trendeddownwards slightly since the spring. This isprobably connected with the strong appreci-ation of the Brazilian real. In the final quarterof 2010, the Mexican economy is likely tohave registered solid growth as well. How-ever, it received stimuli particularly frommanufacturing, in which output increased by1% over the summer quarter’s level. On aver-age for 2010, output in this sector was up byas much as 10%. One of the main contribu-tors was the motor vehicle industry, which in-creased the number of cars manufactured by

1650%. In Latin America, too, food prices have
picked up sharply in the past few months.However, because the weight of food pricesin the Latin American price indices is lowerthan in the indices of the Asian EMEs, it had asomewhat less pronounced impact on head-line inflation rates. In Brazil, year-on-year con-sumer price inflation escalated from 4.7% inSeptember 2010 to 6.0% in January 2011;over the same period, it grew in Mexico from3.7% to 3.8%.
Real GDP in Russia grew by 4% on average
for 2010 according to an initial estimate fromRussia’s Federal State Statistics Service. Thisappears to indicate that, in the final quarterof the year, the Russian economy more thanmade up for the summer output lossescaused by the exceptionally hot wealther andthe wave of large forest and peat bog fires.The main factor behind this improvementwas a perceptible resurgence of investmentactivity, whereas household consumption,measured in terms of real retail sales, still hadbarely any positive impact. The noticeableclouding-over of the price climate may haveplayed a major role; accelerating prices forfood, owing particularly to the summer’sweather-related crop losses, caused inflationto surge to 9.6% in January.
USAIn the final quarter of 2010, the US econo-
my’s growth rate accelerated perceptibly,leaving behind the Q2-Q3 dip. Seasonally ad-justed real GDP rose by
3/4% on the quarter
according to a preliminary estimate after hav-ing risen by
1/2% a period earlier. Overall eco-nomic output thus returned to its cyclical
peak of autumn 2007. GDP growth averaged3% for 2010 as a whole.
The acceleration of aggregate growth was
underpinned by a perceptible increase in pur-chasing by households. They increased theirspending in the fourth quarter by a seasonallyadjusted 1%, the highest rise since autumn2006. Car sales were up by as much as 6
1/2%
from the preceding three-month period. Thebrisk consumption activity has not been re-flected by the indicators of consumer confi-dence because, in the past few years, non-economic factors have been becoming in-creasingly important even though they donot appear to be having any effect on spend-ing (see box on page 17). The strong house-hold consumption growth in autumn 2010was due not only to favourable trends in dis-posable income but also the
1/2percentage
point decline in the household saving ratio.The reduction in savings should probably beseen against the background of improve-ments in household wealth. In addition, thecontinued job market recovery is likely tohave allayed US consumers’ concerns aboutthe future. Over the course of autumn, non-farm employment grew by 385,000, or anaverage of 128,000 jobs per month. In Janu-ary, job growth, at 36,000, was disappoint-ing, not least owing to inclement weatherduring the survey week. However, the un-employment rate fell by 0.4 percentage pointfor the second consecutive month, reaching9.0%, its lowest level since April 2009.

syn chrony with growth in househol ds’ real consumer 
spen ding. Since 2009, however, this has no lon ger 
been the case; while private consumption has seen 
robust growth in the wake of the e conomi c re cov-
ery an d has re cently gathere d signiﬁ cant a dditional 
momentum, measures of consumer sentiment have 
remaine d relatively low.
One possi ble explanation for this re cent diver gen ce 
is provi ded by surveys that re cord certain char-
acteristi cs of consumers alon g with their level of 
conﬁ den ce.  For example, in re cent years Rasmussen 
Reports, an in depen dent me dia company an d pu b-
lic opinion pollin g ﬁ rm, has pu blishe d a consumer 
index that appears to capture consumer conﬁ den ce 
in a similar way to the Conferen ce Boar d’s in dex 
but also provi des a wealth of a dditional informa-
tion. One parti cularly interestin g element is the 
break down of consumer conﬁ den ce a ccording to 
respon dents’ politi cal afﬁ  liation. If the in dices are 
base d uniformly on one year at the beginnin g of 
the referen ce perio d, e g 200 6, there is little differ-
en ce in conﬁ den ce amon g Demo crats, Repu blicans 
an d those of other politi cal afﬁ  liations up to the 
autumn of 2008. The su bsequent es calation of the

tively stron g impa ct on Repu blicans – whi ch mi ght 
be relate d, amon g other thin gs, to the fa ct that 
this group hol ds more ﬁ  nan cial wealth than other 
groups. However, what is most noti ceable is the 
sharp diver gen ce amon g the in dices from the begin-

lastin gly re gaine d their conﬁ den ce after Presi dent 
Obama’s inau guration, consumer sentiment amon g 
Repu blicans remaine d su bdue d, dragging down the 
overall in dex. The same kin d of effe ct may also be 
behin d the continuin g la ck of conﬁ den ce amon g 
small businesses. The movements in one in dex

18developments. The sharp rise in prices in the
international commodity markets caused theconsumer price index to increase in the finalquarter of 2010 by just over
1/2%, seasonally
adjusted, compared to the summer quarter’slevel. Excluding energy and food, however,inflation continued to fall. The year-on-yearrates of the two indices, at 1.3% and 0.7%,were still relatively low in autumn; core infla-tion was even at its lowest level since thetime series was launched in 1958.
Alongside household consumption, foreign
trade provided a strong positive boost to GDPgrowth. The noticeable reduction in the tradedeficit was caused not so much by exportsbut by a considerable decline in import de-mand, particularly as a countermovement tothe steep rise in the Q2-Q3 period. Private in-vestment in machinery and equipment was
more subdued following strong growth in theprevious quarters. Private residential invest-ment continued its roller-coaster ride. Afterhitting a new cyclical low in the third quarter,household spending rebounded slightly in theautumn. At the same time, commercial con-struction, which lags the cycle, is also show-ing signs of stabilising. By contrast, inventoryinvestment, following several quarters inwhich it significantly boosted real GDP, madea negative growth contribution of just underone percentage point. In addition, public sec-tor demand had a slightly dampening im-pact.
JapanIn autumn 2010 the Japanese economy, after
growing by a cumulative 5% over the previ-ous four quarters and recouping most of thecrisis-related overall output losses, paused tocatch its breath. According to the initial esti-mate, real GDP contracted in the final quarterof 2010 by
1/4% on the quarter. With average
growth of 4% for 2010 as a whole, Japan tal-lied the strongest economic growth of all theG7 countries – including Germany. The mainreason why growth tailed off towards theend of the year was that, as expected, house-hold consumption fell into a demand holeonce the government purchasing incentivesexpired. In addition, real exports, which hadprovided a key boost to GDP growth sincethe beginning of the recovery, trended down-wards slightly. In keeping with the disap-pointing results for total output in the au-tumn months, the seasonally adjusted un-employment rate held firm at 5.0%, which isUS households ’ disposable

19relatively high by Japanese standards. Despite
strong GDP growth, the unemployment ratefell by a mere 0.2 percentage point on theyear. The rate of consumer price inflationentered positive territory for the first time intwo years. This was attributable not only tohigher prices for energy and food but also tothe tax hike on tobacco. The latter also left adent in core inflation, which nearly halvedfrom -1.5% in the summer to -0.8% in thelast quarter of the year.
United KingdomThe United Kingdom’s aggregate output was
perceptibly depressed in the autumn by badweather. According to initial calculations, itfell by a seasonally adjusted
1/2% in the final
quarter of the year following strong growthaveraging 1% in the two preceding periods.The UK economy grew by 1
1/2% in 2010 as a
whole. The severe onset of winter with ex-ceptionally heavy snowfall constrained con-struction output in December. Moreover, byconsiderably impairing the transport sector,the weather wrought havoc on much of pub-lic life, eating into value added throughoutthe services sector. According to an estimateby the UK’s Office for National Statistics, thepoor weather reduced aggregate economicoutput by
1/2percentage point. This means
that growth would have ground to a halteven under normal circumstances. Remark-ably, the labour market was unaffected bythe weather. At all events, the number of ap-plicants for unemployment benefits con-tinued to decline slightly in December. At7.8% in October and November, the stand-ardised unemployment rate was somewhathigher than in the two preceding months. In-
flation picked up perceptibly at the turn ofthe year, not least as a result of the VAT hikethat took effect on 1 January 2011. Con-sumer prices as measured by the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices (HICP) were 2.2%higher in January, after seasonal adjustment,than in September 2010. The year-on-year in-flation rate expanded to 4.0% as this reportwent to press.
New EU member statesTaken as a whole, the new EU member states
(EU-8) maintained their upturn in the fourthquarter of 2010. Whereas growth acceler-ated significantly in Bulgaria and the Balticstates, seasonally adjusted GDP growth in theCzech Republic and Hungary slowed down.Economic growth in Poland, for which onlyan estimate of the GDP results for the year isavailable so far, also appears to have slack-ened considerably. Cyclical recovery has notyet begun in Romania. Consumer price infla-tion in the EU-8 as measured by the HICPwas, at 3.9%, perceptibly higher in the clos-ing quarter than in the summer (+3.3%). Thiswas due largely to higher prices for energyand unprocessed food. Excluding these com-ponents, year-on-year inflation went up by amere 0.2 percentage point to 2.7%.

1/2%, yet has
remained markedly below its pre-crisis peak.It is not likely to return to this level untilsometime in 2012. Although growth differ-entials in the euro-area no longer grew in au-tumn among the 11 countries for which ini-tial GDP estimates are available, they re-mained very large. Germany continued togrow somewhat faster than the rest of theeuro area as a group, the result for whichwas once again dragged down by the weakperformance of Greece, Portugal and Italy.Finland, the Netherlands, Austria and Slo-vakia fared better.
The resurgence of industrial activity, in par-
ticular, gave wings to aggregate economicgrowth in the euro area, whereas construc-tion and transport were a drag on growthowing to the onset of severe winter weatherin the more northerly member states. Indus-trial production picked up in the autumnquarter by 1
3/4% on the quarter after season-
al adjustment and thus by 73/4% on the year.

21ing indicators seem to show that the cyclical
recovery continued after the turn of the year.New orders in October-November were up by1
1/4% after seasonal adjustment from the
summer, with orders from non-euro-areacountries even picking up by 5
3/4%. In add-
ition, the results of the European Commissionsurvey indicate that sentiment in industryhas continued to improve in the past fewmonths, especially because the outlook fororders has once again been given a morefavourable assessment amidst persistentlyhigh output expectations and low pressureon inventories.
GDP growth is likely to have received
demand-side support in autumn particularlyfrom exports and enterprises’ spending onnew machinery and equipment. Exports tonon-euro-area countries picked up by a sea-sonally adjusted 2
3/4%, falling just short of
their peak of the winter quarter of 2008.However, imports in the last quarter of theyear grew even more strongly, by 5
3/4%o n
the period, although admittedly the sharp in-creases in the prices of energy and othercommodities played a role. The euro area istherefore running a trade deficit for the firsttime since the end of 2008. The strong in-crease in the manufacture of machinery andequipment is indicative of lively industrial in-vestment activity. Construction output, bycontrast, was down by a seasonally adjusted2
1/4% from the third quarter, though it was
particularly impaired by the onset of winterweather in December. Private consumption,however, is likely to have had a minimal posi-tive impact, if any, on GDP in the fourth quar-ter. Real retail sales were reported as beingdown slightly (-
1/2%) from their average over
the summer months. It must be borne inmind, however, that the relevant data forGermany are not very robust. New car regis-trations during the reporting period were upby 5% from a quarter earlier.
The situation in the euro-area labour market
has stabilised further since mid-2010 but notyet improved. In the third quarter – more re-cent data are not available – employment fellby just a small margin both on the period andalso on the year. The number of employedpersons was up perceptibly in Germany andslightly in France but continued to trenddownwards in the euro-area peripheral coun-tries. The regional development of unemploy-ment shows a similar pattern in reverse. Theunemployment rate for the euro area as aNew orders in the euro area

last quarter of the year, remained unchangedat the level of the Q2-Q3 period. Comparedto the same period a year earlier, the numberof unemployed persons increased by 0.3 mil-lion to 15.85 million.Consumer price inflation in the euro area has
accelerated significantly of late. Year-on-yearHICP inflation went up from 1.7% in thethird quarter of 2010 to 2.0% in the fourthand 2.4% in January. There is much to sug-gest that HICP will run at 2% or somewhathigher in most of the subsequent months of2011 as well. The unusually high increases inthe prices of energy and food, which them-selves are mainly the product of the rise incommodity prices in the global marketscaused by the global economic recovery, area major reason for this. In the final quarter of2010, these components combined increasedby 4.3% year-on-year and, with a weight ofjust under one-third, contributed 1
1/4percent-
age points to headline HICP inflation. In theyears 1999 to 2007, energy and food, givenan average annual rate of increase of 3.6%,had contributed an average of just under onepercentage point. Core inflation, calculatedas HICP less energy and food, and which isquite closely correlated with the change inthe GDP deflator (the price component of do-mestic value added), trended only slightly up-wards over the course of 2010. Its year-on-year increase was 1.1% as this report went topress, corresponding to a
3/4percentage point
contribution to annual HICP inflation. In themeantime, initial signs have emerged that,particularly in those euro-area countries thatare leading the cycle, wage growth and con-sequently also inflation in services and indus-trial goods could once again accelerate overthe course of the year.Total

developments
The economic recovery in the euro area con-
tinued during the autumn months of 2010,spurred on by robust global economic activityand the extremely expansionary monetarypolicy being pursued across the world. Never-theless, the rate of growth remained mutedoverall and unevenly distributed across theeuro-area member states. Against this back-drop, and given muted monetary and creditgrowth, the Governing Council of the ECBconcluded that inflation in the euro areawould remain in line with price stability overthe policy-relevant medium-term horizon.However, it stressed the need to monitor de-velopments very closely, as several factors, inparticular a continued upwards movement ofcommodity prices, could result in the risks toprice stability, currently still balanced, movingto the upside in the medium term. As a result,the Governing Council decided to keep thepolicy rates unchanged at their historicallylow levels. The Eurosystem therefore remu-nerated balances held in the deposit facility at
1/4% throughout and charged 13/4% for re-
course to the marginal lending facility. Themain refinancing rate remained unchangedat 1%.
The final quarter of 2010 saw an upward ten-
dency in euro money market interest rates,which can mainly be attributed to banksonce again considerably reducing their ex-cess liquidity as the last outstanding 6 and12-month tenders expired.

24shifted at the start of the quarter. Whereas
overnight rates had, up until then, fallen backsharply after rising briefly on the last day of amaintenance period as a result of theliquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation,during the last quarter of 2010, EONIA some-times remained elevated for considerablylonger than previously. This meant that thespread between the overnight rate and themain refinancing rate fell from almost 60basis points on average in the previous quar-
ter to just over 40 basis points in the finalquarter. Following the first meeting of theECB Governing Council in January, EONIArose very sharply after having declined con-tinuously during the last maintenance periodof 2010, and at times was noticeably abovethe main refinancing rate for several consecu-tive days.
Given the renewed intensification of the sov-
ereign debt crisis in several euro-area coun-tries during the fourth quarter, the GoverningCouncil at the start of December decided tomaintain its policy of full allotment in allliquidity-providing operations at least untilthe end of the first quarter of 2011. Theinterest rate indexation of its regular longer-term refinancing operations with a maturityof three months, which has been appliedsince October, was also extended for the firstquarter of the new year. Full allotment at thefixed rate of 1% was continued for the mainrefinancing operations and for refinancingoperations with a maturity of one mainten-ance period.
The Eurosystem’s purchase programme for
public and private debt securities (SecuritiesMarket Programme, SMP) was also con-tinued, but the liquidity it supplied was regu-larly absorbed. With the exception of twoliquidity-absorbing operations at the end ofDecember and start of February, every oper-ation of this type was oversubscribed. Thefirst of the two undersubscribed liquidity-absorbing operations was overshadowed bythe imminent turn of the year, whereas theMoney market interest rates

noticeable reduction in excess liquidity.
Between October and January, longer-term
unsecured euro-area money market ratescontinued the upward tendency they hadbegun in the second quarter. After a notice-able increase at the beginning of October,prices did fall slightly until year-end. As withthe overnight rate, however, the increasepicked up again after the Governing Coun-
cil’s first monetary policy meeting in 2011. Asthis publication went to press, the interestrate on unsecured interbank liquidity with athree-month maturity (three-month Euribor)stood at around 1.10% – its highest levelsince mid-2009.

26Deutsche BundesbankMoney market management and liquidity needs
During the three maintenance periods from 13 October
2010 to 18 January 2011, euro-area credit institutions’
need for central bank liquidity as determined by autono-
mous liquidity factors fell by €36.8 billion in net terms. A
decline in government deposits with the Eurosystem was
a contributory factor, lowering credit institutions’ liquid-
ity needs by a total of €15.1 billion in the period under
review. The combined analysis of net foreign assets and
other factors, a move which eliminates valuation effects
with no impact on liquidity, shows that net liquidity of
€41.5 billion was provided over the three periods. This
was mainly the result of emergency liquidity assistance
measures in individual countries as well as the fact that
several national central banks of the Eurosystem in-
creased their holdings of euro-denominated securities
not related to monetary policy. While these factors pro-
vided liquidity, the increased volume of banknotes in cir-
culation had an absorbing effect. Banknotes in circula-
tion rose – chiefly owing to the usual seasonal increase
around Christmas – by €19.8 billion net in the period
under review. On 24 December 2010, banknotes in circu-
lation in the Eurosystem reached a new high of €842 bil-
lion. The minimum reserve requirement dropped by a
total of €1.3 billion during the three maintenance
periods and thereby amplified the effect of reduced li-
quidity needs arising from autonomous factors.
This period under review was also characterised by a gen-
erous supply of liquidity, with which the Eurosystem’s li-
quidity management met credit institutions’ demand for
central bank liquidity – over and above the benchmark
amount – and helped ensure the smooth functioning of
the money market. Liquidity-providing open-market op-
erations continued to be carried out as fixed-rate tenders
with full allotment of the submitted bids, which meant
that liquidity provision was determined by demand from
credit institutions (see table on page 25). At its meeting
on 2 December 2010, the Governing Council of the ECB
decided to continue the full allotment policy both in
main and longer-term refinancing operations at least
until the end of the March-April 2011 maintenance
period. The three-month refinancing operations will
again be allotted at the fixed rate, which is indexed to
the average of the minimum bid rates of the main refi-
nancing operations over the life of this operation.
Aided by the expiry of the last outstanding six-month
tender in mid-November 2010 and of the third 12-monthtender at the end of December 2010, a further shift oc-
curred during the three maintenance periods away from
longer-term towards shorter-term central bank refinan-
cing. Comparing period averages, the volume of main re-
financing operations grew by roughly €33 billion (net) in
the observation period, while the volume of longer-term
refinancing operations fell by €76 billion. Furthermore,
the recovery of the interbank market, which had com-
menced after the first one-year tender expired at the be-
ginning of July 2010, continued in the period under re-
view, with money market turnover and interest rates in
some cases considerably exceeding the averages of the
first half of the year.
Moreover, the Eurosystem continued to purchase bonds
under the Securities Markets Programme (launched in
May 2010) and increased its holdings throughout the
three maintenance periods by around €13 billion to
€76.5 billion. However, the weekly liquidity-absorbing
fine-tuning operations taking place at the same time al-
most fully re-absorbed the liquidity provided by these
purchases. Only in the last liquidity-absorbing operation
in December did absorption fall slightly short of the in-
tended amount, due to special factors at year-end. Inde-
pendently of these weekly quick tenders, the Eurosystem
continued to conduct a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning
operation on the last day of every maintenance period
throughout the period under review in order to with-
draw excess central bank liquidity.
The October-November 2010 maintenance period was
marked by reduced central bank liquidity compared with
the previous period after the second 12-month tender
had expired at the end of September and credit institu-
tions had only rolled over part of the amount due into
other tenders. The associated decline in excess liquidity,
ie the central bank liquidity exceeding the benchmark
amount, led to perceptibly lower average recourse to the
deposit facility of €42 billion (previous period €69 bil-
lion). Simultaneously, the EONIA rose significantly to
average 0.71% over the period (after 0.48% in the previ-
ous period), while underlying turnover remained virtual-
ly unchanged at €46.2 billion.
At the beginning of the November-December 2010 main-
tenance period, the Eurosystem conducted an additional
six-day liquidity-providing fine-tuning operation in order
to bridge the gap between the last expiring six-month

27tender (repayment of €36 billion) and the next main refi-
nancing operation. However, as demand was only just
under €13 billion in this six-day tender, the outstanding
tender volume declined to €514 billion and rose only
slightly to up to €525 billion by the end of the period.
Nevertheless, the EONIA fixings gradually decreased dur-
ing the period and were – at an average of 0.58% – no-
ticeably lower than in the previous period. Underlying
unsecured turnover also declined to an average of €41.1
billion. By contrast, turnover of secured overnight money
on Eurex Repo’s GC Pooling trading platform rose to
€12.4 billion on average over the period after it had al-
ready increased to an average of €9.7 billion in the previ-
ous period (period before that: €8.0 billion). Recourse to
the deposit facility averaged €45 billion over the period,
whereas the marginal lending facility was used percep-
tibly more in this period (€1.9 billion on average) than in
the two other maintenance periods of the period under
review (only €0.8 billion and €0.5 billion respectively).
The six-week long maintenance period December 2010-
January 2011 included the expiry of the last 12-month
tender, which resulted in a total of €97 billion maturing
shortly before Christmas. In order to mitigate the liquid-
ity outflow and to prevent possible tensions around the
Christmas holiday period and the end of the year, the
Eurosystem conducted a liquidity-providing thirteen-day
bridge operation in addition to the regular three-month
tender. This tender settled on the maturity date of the
12-month tender and also covered the year end. Of the
total of €201 billion maturing on 23 December, around
€170 billion was ultimately rolled over into the bridge
tender (€21 billion) and the three-month tender (€149
billion). Furthermore, credit institutions noticeably raised
demand for liquidity in the last main refinancing oper-
ation of the year by over €34 billion, which meant that
the turn of the year passed off smoothly from a liquidity
management point of view. Owing to the somewhat
higher liquidity supply, recourse to the deposit facility
also increased in this maintenance period to €66 billion
on average. The EONIA, which had stood at 0.72% at the
beginning of the period, subsequently steadily decreased
to as little as 0.36%. In addition to the comfortable li-
quidity conditions, the high level of credit institutions’
current accounts in the first days of the maintenance
period, which allowed reserve requirements to be met
early (frontloading), led to falling overnight rates. Only
at the end of the year and the end of the maintenanceperiod was the EONIA – in line with seasonal patterns –
fixed distinctly higher at 0.82% and 0.81% respectively.
At the same time, on average over the period, unsecured
EONIA turnover (€40.4 billion) as well as secured over-
night turnover on GC Pooling (€12.4 billion) were virtual-
ly unchanged compared to the previous period.
In the subsequent maintenance period (January-February
2011), the EONIA rose markedly and on several occasions
exceeded the main refinancing rate of 1.00% as a result
of perceptibly lower excess liquidity.Factors determining bank liquidity1

just under 0.8% on the secured money mar-ket as this report went to press, which is justunder 30 basis points higher than at the endof the third quarter. The yield spread be-tween the unsecured and secured moneymarket rate (depo-repo spread), which canbe interpreted as a risk premium, also experi-enced strong volatility in the fourth quarter.Due to a marked rise in the secured interestrate following the expiry of the second12-month tender, the interest rate spread onthe three-month maturity narrowed toaround 23 basis points – its lowest level sincethe start of the financial market turmoil inAugust 2007. By the turn of the year, the riskpremium had doubled to just under 46 basispoints, but narrowed once again to around30 basis points by mid-February.
Monetary developments in the euro area
Monetary expansion in the euro area weak-
ened perceptibly in the last quarter of 2010after having accelerated noticeably duringthe two previous quarters. In seasonally ad-justed and annualised terms, the three-month rate of the broad monetary aggregateM3 amounted to just under 1% in the finalquarter of 2010, and was therefore almost 3percentage points below the correspondingvalue for the months July to September. Theannual growth rate of M3 rose from 1.1% to1.7% during the same period, which was, inpart, attributable to a base effect, however.
Looking at monetary assets, growth in over-
night deposits was again less in the reportingperiod than in the preceding quarters. As cur-
rency in circulation was simultaneously evenreduced slightly from October to December,the seasonally adjusted and annualised three-month rate for the narrow monetary aggre-gate M1 fell to 1
1/2% in this period, its lowest
level since mid-2008.
Furthermore, monetary growth during the re-
porting quarter was also weakened by devel-opments in other short-term deposits, whereholdings fell slightly on the quarter. Their sea-sonally adjusted and annualised three-monthrate of -1
1/2% was noticeably below that of
the previous quarter. A determining factor inthis development may be the fact that, in thefourth quarter, interest rates at the long endof the yield curve rose more sharply than atthe short end. The increasing interest rate dis-advantage of short-term deposits could havecaused investors to shift into longer-term in-vestments.
M3 growth was strengthened by positive de-
velopments in marketable instruments duringthe reporting period, which was chiefly dueto sharp growth in repo transactions. Al-though these transactions were, as usual,undertaken mainly by other financial inter-mediaries, there was also clear demand forthis investment from non-financial corpor-ations again for the first time since mid-2009.This growth went a long way towards com-pensating for the ongoing reduction inmoney market fund shares and short-termbank debt securities, particularly as this hadslowed overall in comparison to the first halfof 2010.

29Among the counterparts of M3, lending by
banks resident in the euro area to domesticnon-banks was again of particular signifi-cance for monetary expansion in the finalquarter of 2010. The extraordinarily sharprise in MFI loans to government during the re-porting period is particularly striking. The risewas, however, largely attributable to transac-tions conducted between the Hypo RealEstate (HRE) Group and the FMS Wertman-agement resolution agency. The latter oper-ates as a public-law entity for the HRE groupand is for statistical purposes classified as partof the government sector.
By contrast, lending by banks to the domestic
private sector weakened significantly duringthe reporting quarter, which on balance wassolely the result of lower securitised lending,however. Yet unlike securitised lending,unsecuritised loans with a seasonally adjustedand annualised three-month rate of justunder 2
1/2% grew virtually just as fast as dur-
ing the third quarter. In sectoral terms, loanswere primarily granted to households, wherestrong growth was once again driven byloans for house purchase, which make up thelion’s share of household borrowing and con-tinue to benefit from historically favourablefinancing conditions. By contrast, loans tonon-financial corporations decreased notice-ably during the period under review with aseasonally adjusted and annualised three-month rate of just over -2%, after havingrecorded noticeable growth in the previousquarter for the first time in six quarters.Judging by the results of the quarterly banklending survey for the euro area, the subduedunderlying demand for loans was primarilyattributable to the good availability of in-
ternal funds for non-financial corporations.Furthermore, euro-area banks’ lending oper-ations to the domestic private sector in themonths October to December were charac-terised by a strong rise in loans to other finan-cial intermediaries. However, as such loansmainly constitute indirect interbank business,they are not per se accompanied by lending
to the private non-banking sector.
Finally, M3 growth in the final quarter of
2010 was again restrained by a significantrise in monetary capital, meaning longer-termdeposits, bank debt securities and banks’capital (which are not part of M3), increasedby a seasonally adjusted and annualisedthree-month rate of just under 4% as this re-port went to press.

30noticeable outflows of funds from net exter-
nal assets of banks (MFIs) vis-à-vis non-euro-area residents. This factor, which also sub-dues M3 growth, must partly be seen in con-nection with the transfer of HRE Group assetsto their resolution agency, however.
Considered as a whole, the underlying mon-
etary dynamics – in other words, that monet-ary growth that is ultimately relevant to infla-tion – remained muted in the fourth quarterof 2010. In line with this, inflation risk indica-tors based on monetary data continue to indi-cate that there is no pronounced risk to pricestability in the euro area over the policy-relevant horizon. However, the high degreeof uncertainty associated with these indica-tors at present should not be overlooked.
German banks’ deposit and lending
business with domestic customers
The upward trend in deposit growth among
German banks, which has been observedsince the start of 2010, did not continue inthe final quarter. In fact, the seasonally ad-justed and annualised three-month rate forbank deposits fell to 1% compared with3
1/2% in the previous quarter. This was
fuelled by waning momentum in short-termbank deposits, which in turn was presumablymainly attributable to the recent rise in theremuneration of longer-term investments. Asin the euro area as a whole, highly liquidovernight deposits received fewer net inflowsagain on the quarter, which is likely dueto their comparatively low remuneration.

31posits (redeemable at notice of up to three
months), especially from households, wereon a par with the preceding quarters. Short-term time deposits (with an agreed maturityof up to two years) declined again in the finalquarter of 2010 after recording slight net in-flows in the previous quarter, albeit at a sig-nificantly reduced pace than in the precedingquarters.
Longer-term bank deposits were reduced fur-
ther overall in Germany in the last quarter of2010, but at a slower rate than in the previ-ous quarter. The general upward tendencyobserved for yields in Germany was notmatched by interest rates for longer-term de-posits. Longer-term time deposits (with anagreed maturity of over two years) weretherefore reduced further by insurance com-panies and pension funds, which traditionallyrepresent the most important investor groupin this area. These deposits stagnated acrossall sectors in the final quarter. Moreover,households reduced their holdings of long-term savings deposits (redeemable at noticeof over three months) more or less as stronglyas in the two preceding quarters.
Domestic banks’ lending business with do-
mestic customers enjoyed an extraordinarilystrong revival in the final quarter of 2010.This increase, which was stronger than thatfor the euro area as a whole, was reflected ina rise in the seasonally adjusted and annual-ised three-month rate from just over -2
1/2%i n
the third quarter to 13% in the reportingperiod. This revival is, however, mainly ex-plained by transfers between the bankingand government sectors in connection withthe establishment of the FMS Wertmanage-
ment resolution agency by the HRE Group.Credit to the domestic private sector also in-creased strongly in the reporting period,however. This was due to German banksacquiring securities from private issuers and,more significantly in terms of volume, bythem increasing their holdings of privatesector loans with a seasonally-adjusted andannualised three-month rate of just under4% in the fourth quarter, after just under-3% in the previous quarter. But the vast ma-jority of these holdings are loans to financialcorporations, which had decreased sharply inthe previous quarter and have been excep-tionally volatile on the whole since the finan-cial crisis intensified in the autumn of 2008.Lending and deposits of monetary

32In addition, domestic households also in-
creased their debt levels further. But growthin lending to households, at a seasonally ad-justed and annualised three-month rate of1
1/2%, compared with just over1/2% in the
previous quarter, was still weaker than in theeuro area as a whole. The growth in Germanystemmed both from loans for house purchaseand consumer loans, with the former likely tohave benefited from favourable mortgagerates and the latter from households’ optimis-tic expectations regarding the economy.Domestic non-financial corporations slightlyreduced their net borrowing/loans fromdomestic banks again in the final quarter of2010, particularly in the short-term segment.Although the annualised and seasonallyadjusted three-month rate rose from just over-1
1/2% to just under -1%, it could not matchthe positive growth observed in the second
quarter of 2010. Therefore, looking at 2010as a whole, the level of corporate exposurestagnated with fluctuating monthly changes.The German economy’s sharp upward move-ment in 2010 has therefore not yet led toaccelerated lending to the corporate sector.One factor was probably that the economicupswing provided non-financial corporationswith better access to alternative sources offunding, particularly internally generatedfinancial resources.
The results of the latest Bank Lending Survey
(BLS) indicate slightly more relaxed credit sup-ply conditions in Germany during the lastquarter of 2010. The positive risk assessmentby the participating banks, especially thegood expectations regarding general eco-nomic activity, was the main reason for thesomewhat eased credit standards for loans tosmall and medium-sized enterprises and inthe consumer credit business. The marginsfor average-risk loans contracted in almost allbusiness areas, whereas higher-risk loan mar-gins expanded – except for loans for con-sumption purposes. In this credit segment,demand also stagnated, while there was anoticeable increase in interest from house-holds in loans for house purchase and fromenterprises for funds for fixed investment aswell as inventories and working capital.Banks expect credit standards to ease furtherin the first quarter of 2011, and as usual ap-pear optimistic as regards demand expect-ations.

33Deuts che Bun desbankFourth spe cial survey on German banks’
len ding to domesti c enterprises
In January 2011, the Deuts che Bun desbank con ducted 
its fourth spe cial survey amon g sele cted German 
banks.1 The main aim of this survey is to gauge how 
banks expe ct their len ding business with domesti c 
non-ﬁ  nan cial corporations to develop over the next 
twelve months. This time, the banks were also aske d 
what measures they are likely to take in response to the ti ghter re gulations in the context of Basel III.
2 
Like the previous surveys, the current roun d does not 
indicate any bottlene cks in relation to bank loans 
to enterprises. The survey parti cipants expe ct loan 
volume to rise si gniﬁ cantly in 2011, pre dominantly 
due to loans to small an d me dium-size d enterprises 
(SMEs). A contri butory fa ctor in the stron g growth in 
new len ding is the in crease d use of existin g credit lines. 
Repayments, parti cularly by lar ge enterprises, continue 
to have a dampenin g effe ct on the credit a ggregate. 
Write- downs are now virtually ne gligible.
The surveye d banks believe that the expe cted rise in 
the loan volume will, as before, be attri buta ble in par-
ticular to the e conomi c upturn as well as to in crease d 
corporate deman d for loans to ﬁ  nan ce investment an d 
exports (see a djacent chart). This development will 
also be supporte d by banks’ in creasin g willin gness to 
grant syn dicate d loans, by their goo d liquidity position, 
increasin g access to the se con dary market for loans an d 
to the se curitisation market, as well as hi gher deman d 
for loans as a repla cement for internal ﬁ  nan cing. Thus 
the expe cted growth in len ding stan ds on a consi der-
ably broa der base than a year a go. A ccording to the 
respon dents, greater competition from other banks, 
the in crease d importan ce of the capital market as an 
alternative sour ce of fun ding as well as hi gher capital 
costs for the surveye d institutions in the case of loans 
to lar ge enterprises will have a dampenin g effe ct in 
2011. Despite growth in len ding an d the strains from the 
euro-area soverei gn debt crisis, the surveye d banks 
fore cast risin g capital ratios for 2011. They aim to 
achieve this pre dominantly by retainin g proﬁ  ts, raisin g 
new e quity an d re ducing other risk-wei ghte d assets. In 
the wake of “Basel III”, the institutions currently plan 
in parti cular to raise their re gulatory capital.

The margin policy wassimilar in both reference areas: the marginsfor higher-risk loans were increased, in somecases noticeably, as in Germany, whereasthey remained virtually unchanged for theaverage borrower. Net demand rose notice-ably in the euro area as a whole but still lessthan in Germany.
The survey round for the fourth quarter of
2010 again contained ad hoc questions on
the impact of the financial crisis on wholesalefunding, capital costs and the willingness ofthe participating banks to lend. They indi-cated that access to wholesale funding hadnot changed, and only conditions for access-ing the money market had improved on thequarter. At the same time, over one-third ofthe German bank managers surveyed saidcapital costs were higher in the wake of the
financial crisis, while one-quarter of themspoke of some impact on their willingness tolend. The European survey participants saidthey had difficulties in bond market financingand once again said their capital position hadconstrained lending more than did Germaninstitutions.
In the final quarter of 2010, German bank
lending rates developed unevenly but did riseslightly overall. Rates for long-term loans forhouse purchase increased to 3.8%. Rates forlong-term, small-scale loans to non-financialcorporations grew at a similar pace, whereaslarge-scale loans with long rate fixationcheapened somewhat to 3.6%. Conditionsfor short-term enterprise loans also edgedupwards and stood at 3.8% and 2.8% re-spectively at the end of the year, dependingon the size of the loan.

Developments in the international financial
markets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and inearly-2011 were influenced above all by themore favourable global economic outlook aswell as by the debt crisis in several euro-areaperipheral countries. In the United States andJapan, market participants’ confidence in theeconomic recovery grew. In the euro area,upbeat German growth prospects made asubstantial contribution to the more benignoutlook. In this setting, capital market ratesrose worldwide. This was also reflected inhigher yields on the international corporatebond markets. On the international equitymarkets, the reversal of previous safe-havenflows as well as positive corporate results andimproved expectations of earnings growth onboth sides of the Atlantic led to sharply high-er stock prices. At the same time, investor un-certainty declined perceptibly. The exchangerate developments of the euro show no clear-cut tendency in light of the conflicting deter-minants. Of the euro-area peripheral coun-tries, market participants focused on Ireland.At the end of November, given the enormousburdens for the state budget as a result ofthe financial sector restructuring process, Ire-land formally requested the rescue packageoffered by the EU.

37tries of the euro area drove foreign exchange
market developments, too. At the beginningof November, following the Federal Reserve’sdecision to purchase further governmentbonds worth a total of US$600 billion (in anenvironment of still subdued economic ex-pectations for the United States), the euro-dollar exchange rate climbed to US$1.42.This was the highest level since January 2010.However, as the financial and governmentcrisis in Ireland intensified and the threat of acredit rating downgrade for Portugal evolved,the friendly sentiment turned against theeuro, and it came under downward pressure.In addition, the US dollar received a boostfrom unexpectedly favourable US labour mar-ket data. By the end of November, the eurohad slipped to US$1.30. The single currencyinitially stabilised somewhat in the time thatfollowed, before further positive economicdata from the United States again burdenedthe euro-dollar exchange rate at the begin-ning of the new year.
The euro began to rally strongly around mid-
January after worries about the sustainabilityof public finances in the euro-area peripheralcountries were eased somewhat by thesuccessful auction of Portuguese sovereignbonds, reports of the Japanese government’splans to buy European debt securities and thesuccessful placement of the EFSF’s inauguralbond. Moreover, the publication of the Ifobusiness climate index for Germany, whichwas again better than expected and reacheda new record high, gave the euro an add-itional boost. As this report went to press, theeuro stood at US$1.36, somewhat below thelevel recorded at the end of September andabout 1
1/2% above its level at the start of
2011.
After the euro at first fluctuated around the
114 yen mark in October last year, it subse-quently depreciated somewhat when Japanpresented unexpectedly favourable economicgrowth figures, falling in the first half of Jan-uary 2011 to as low as 107 yen. When the Ifobusiness climate index was announced andExchange rate of the euro

38the euro-area sovereign bond markets grad-
ually calmed down, the euro subsequentlyappreciated on a broad front. By contrast,the downgrading of Japan’s creditworthinessand less favourable economic data put astrain on the yen around the turn of the year.As this report went to press, the euro stoodat 113 yen, or 4
1/2% above its value at the be-
ginning of the year.
Against the pound sterling, too, the euro ini-
tially lost value in November as a result of thedebt crisis affecting several euro-area coun-tries. However, the losses were comparativelyslight, and were almost totally reversed bythe end of the year. Market participants’speculations that the Bank of England mightraise interest rates to counter growing infla-tionary pressures in the United Kingdomstrengthened the pound sterling in the firsthalf of January, causing the euro-pound ster-ling exchange rate to fall from 0.86 poundsterling to 0.83 pound sterling. The an-nouncement of a negative growth rate forthe UK economy in the fourth quarter subse-quently burdened the pound sterling, how-ever. As this report went to press, the eurowas trading at 0.84 pound sterling.
Following the accession of Estonia to the
euro area, the euro effective exchange rateindex has been calculated vis-à-vis 20 insteadof 21 major trading partners since the begin-ning of the year. Since the end of September,the euro has depreciated somewhat on aver-age (-2%) against the currencies of thesecountries. In December, the single currencyfell to a new low against the Swiss franc,which is apparently considered a compara-tively safe investment haven in times of
heightened nervousness in the financial mar-kets. However, the euro began a compara-tively strong recovery, also against the Swissfranc, at the beginning of the new year.
As this report went to press, the effective ex-
change rate of the euro was
1/2% above its
level at the turn of the year and on par withits value at the launch of monetary union. Inreal terms, ie taking account of the simultan-eous inflation differentials between the euroarea and its major trading partners, it wastherefore still well above its longer-term aver-age. This indicates an unfavourable pricecompetitiveness of euro-area suppliers.
Securities markets and portfolio
transactions
Government bond yields in large industrial
countries rose significantly during the fourthquarter of 2010 and into 2011. Since end-September 2010, the yield on ten-year Bundshas increased by 1 percentage point to 3
1/4%,
while the yield on US Treasuries of the samematurity moved up by just over 1 percentagepoint to 3
1/2%, and that for bonds of the Jap-
anese central government climbed by 40 basispoints to just over 1
1/4%. In an environment
of sometimes high uncertainty, yield move-ments – as gauged by the implied volatility ofoptions, which was above the five-year aver-age – reflect above all the growing signs of astronger economic upturn. This upturn hasbeen visible not only in higher real interestrates but also – with food and commodityprices on the increase – in rising inflation ex-... and against

39pectations. Credit risk premiums also went
up in the market segment for public sectorbonds, probably driven inter alia by investors’
worries about the extent to which the bur-dens caused by the rescue packages mightjeopardise the general sustainability of gov-ernment debt in individual European coun-tries. In the United States the announcementat the beginning of November that therewould be renewed purchases of sovereignbonds briefly caused yields to fall before theeconomic recovery and higher inflation ex-pectations there, too, drove them up again.
The worsening of Ireland’s problems in the
final quarter of 2010 had a decisive impacton yield spreads in the euro area. Supportmeasures for the financial sector going wellinto the double-digit billions of euro onceagain put the Irish government budget undersubstantial pressure. Irish risk premiums onthe capital markets rose to all-time highs,pulling premiums of other peripheral coun-tries up with them. Ireland requested inter-national assistance at the end of November.However, the situation on the capital marketsdid not ease dramatically at first. Instead, thegulf between the financing conditions of indi-vidual countries widened further on thewhole, not least as a result of market partici-pants’ growing sensitivity with regard tothe sustainability of public debt. The GDP-weighted yield spread of long-term euro-areagovernment bonds over Bunds rose to an all-time high of almost 190 basis points beforeshedding 30 basis points by the end of Jan-uary 2011; on balance, it was 2 basis pointsabove the level recorded at the end of Sep-tember 2010.During the course of the final quarter of
2010 the German yield curve shifted upwardsat the long end, and interest rates have risenat the short end, too, since the beginning ofthis year. On the whole, higher real interestrates and increasing breakeven inflation ratesled to a sharper increase for ten-year bondsthan for short-dated Federal securities. In thelatter case, the rise in yields was driven by thereduction of excess liquidity on the moneyYield spreads

40market and expectations of interest rate in-
creases that had been moved forwards. Thedifference between ten-year and two-yearyields widened accordingly by 35 basis pointsto 200 basis points, and is still well above itsfive-year average of just more than 110 basispoints. Above all, this development may beattributed to the fact that market participantsnow expect a quicker normalisation of inter-est rate conditions on the money market anda lasting increase in interest rates.
In the period under review, the changed
interest rate environment was also reflectedin higher yields on European corporatebonds. Moreover, the yield dispersion be-tween the countries increased – as with sov-ereign bonds –, with banks in several periph-eral countries reporting an especially sharprise in debt financing costs. All in all, at the
end of the reporting period, yields on BBB-rated, euro-denominated corporate bonds– as measured by the iBoxx bond index,which comprises bonds issued by banks andnon-banks – were, at 5
1/2%, just more than
1/2percentage point above the figure at the
end of September.
By contrast, the corresponding interest rate
spreads over German Bunds narrowed byabout 40 basis points. On the one hand, thisreflects the fact that market participants tooka somewhat more optimistic view of enter-prises’ credit risk despite the higher yields,which is also expressed in the fall in price un-certainty observed on the equity markets andin lower credit derivative indices comparedwith September. On the other hand, a declinein the liquidity premium demanded by invest-ors is likely to have played a part. The bottomline is that the financing conditions for enter-prises on the capital market are not to beconsidered unfavourable given the improvedeconomic outlook.

41with €3241/2billion in the previous three-
month period. However, taking into accountthe redemptions and changes in issuers’ hold-ings, which were unusually high due to theFMS-WM transactions, domestic issuers in-creased their capital market borrowing byonly €5 billion. In the fourth quarter, foreigndebt instruments totalling €110 billion weresold in the German bond market. These highsales figures were attributable primarily tothe transfer of assets from abroad followingthe foundation of FMS-WM in October 2010.Thus, the total outstanding volume of bondsin Germany rose by €115 billion in the quar-ter under review.
During the same period, the outstanding vol-
ume of public sector debt securities droppedby €85
1/2billion. This unprecedented decline
is likewise due mainly to the transactions con-ducted by FMS-WM, which redeemed theSOFFIN-guaranteed bonds it had taken overfrom HRE in October and successively re-placed them with its own issues. At the sametime, FMS-WM strongly expanded holdingsof its own bonds temporarily. Both the re-demptions and the increased holdings of itsown paper more than offset the large issu-ance volume, leading to negative net sales.

In addition, the Federal government itself is-sued, above all, 10-year bonds worth €15 bil-lion as well as Treasury discount paper(Bubills) worth €3 billion and 2-year FederalTreasury notes (Schätze) worth €1 billion. Onthe other hand, it redeemed 5-year Federalnotes (Bobls) and 30-year bonds (€8 billionand €3
1/2billion respectively). The Federal
states tapped the bond market for €2 billionnet in the fourth quarter of 2010.While there was a decrease in public debt
outstanding, a growth of almost equal di-mensions was posted for debt instruments is-sued by credit institutions worth €83 billion.Thus, only the outstanding volume of otherbank debt securities which can be structuredflexibly rose (€96 billion). As mentionedabove, HRE played an important role in thiscontext by transferring extensive holdings ofits own SOFFIN-guaranteed bonds to FMS-WM. By contrast, net redemptions of publicand mortgage Pfandbriefe totalled €9 billionand €2
1/2billion respectively, while debt se-
curities issued by specialised credit institutionsto the tune of €2 billion were redeemed.Investment activity in the German

On the whole, non-bankfinancial enterprises were especially activeissuers (€5 billion). Non-financial corporationstapped the capital market in the amountof €1 billion, after redeeming paper worth€2 billion in the previous quarter.In the fourth quarter of 2010, debt securities
in Germany were purchased exclusively bydomestic non-banks, which added €135 bil-lion (net) worth of fixed-income securities totheir portfolios; these were foreign debtinstruments (€131
1/2billion) and domestic
paper issued by private borrowers (€120 bil-lion). These figures, too, very largely reflectthe takeover of securities of the HRE Groupby FMS-WM. Foreign investors increasedtheir holdings of German debt securities by€9 billion. By contrast, domestic credit insti-tutions sold fixed-income securities worth€29 billion; the focus here was on foreignbonds.
The international equity markets were
marked by brighter economic prospects inthe fourth quarter. In the United States, con-fidence grew following the publication oflargely favourable economic data. Moreover,the expectation of many market participantsthat the expansive US monetary policy wouldcontinue for some time is likely to have bol-stered the equity markets. In the euro area,equity prices received a boost from marketparticipants’ pronounced optimism with re-gard to German economic growth, which isalso spilling over to other countries throughincreased imports. Another positive factorwas that, after Ireland opted to make use ofthe rescue package, several peripheral coun-tries were able to place new sovereign bonds.This seems to have encouraged investors to li-quidate safe-haven positions and invest thefreed-up funds on the equity markets.

went to press.
On both sides of the Atlantic, the brighter
economic prospects had a positive impact oncorporate results and on future growth ex-pectations, which improved in both casesone-year-ahead and looking further into thefuture. In this setting, the capital market rate,which was also up, did not perceptibly damp-en equity prices. Measured against thebroad-based CDAX and S&P 500 indices,German and US equities have therefore madesharp price gains of 19% and 17% respect-ively since the end of September, with Euro-pean equities (Euro Stoxx) appreciating 12%.
The excess return investors demand for an in-
vestment in European shares (Euro Stoxx) ascompared to a safe investment, which can becalculated using a dividend discount model,slipped just less than
1/2percentage point to
around 63/4%. Despite the decline, it there-
fore remains clearly above the five-year aver-age (about 5
1/2%). This indicates that risk
aversion among investors active in the overallmarket is still above average, despite the dis-tinct price gains, and that the valuation ofequities is not especially high. The implied riskpremium for exposure to European bankingstocks was almost unchanged at the end ofthe reporting period at just under 6
1/4%. This
was because not only equity prices but alsolong-term earnings expectations for bankswere down. Apparently, investors continueto demand less risk compensation for holdingbank shares than for holding other equities.Major items of the balance of

44Issuance on the domestic stock market picked
up significantly in the fourth quarter of 2010.Domestic enterprises issued €11
1/2billion in
new shares, compared with €1 billion in themonths July to September. This was duemainly to a capital increase by a credit institu-tion. The volume of outstanding foreign equi-ties in Germany increased by €11
1/2billion.
Shares were purchased by resident non-banks and by credit institutions (€16
1/2billion
and €9 billion respectively). Whereas creditinstitutions primarily purchased German equi-ties, German non-banks mostly bought for-eign stocks. By contrast, foreign investorsscaled back their holdings of German equitiesby €2
1/2billion, above all by unwinding port-
folio investment.
In the reporting period, domestic mutual
funds recorded a net inflow of €26 billion,compared with €23 billion in the previousquarter. The fresh money mainly benefitedspecialised funds reserved for institutional in-vestors (€23
1/2billion). Among funds open to
the general public, share-based funds inparticular attracted positive inflows giventhe cheerful sentiment in the stock markets(€4 billion), followed by mixed securities-based funds, mixed funds and funds of funds(€
1/2billion each). By contrast, bond-based
funds and open-end real estate funds record-ed outflows (-€2 billion and -€
1/2billion re-
spectively). Sales of foreign mutual fund unitsin Germany totalled €3 billion.
Mutual fund shares were bought overwhelm-
ingly by domestic non-banks, which placed€26 billion worth of such shares in their port-
folios, the vast majority being domestic fundshares (€25 billion). Credit institutions in-creased their exposure to mutual fund sharesby €2 billion, buying only foreign fund shareson balance. Non-resident investors increasedtheir holdings of domestic fund shares by€1 billion.
Direct investment
Direct investment was almost balanced in the
fourth quarter of 2010, compared with netcapital inflows of €11 billion in the July toSeptember period. This development was at-tributable mainly to an increase in cross-border investment by German enterprises,which supplied their foreign branches with€10
1/2billion; in net terms this consisted only
of equity capital (€12 billion). The increase inforeign investment by German enterpriseswas primarily due to direct investment by thechemical industry (€6 billion), manufacturersof transport equipment (€4

45Economic conditions
in GermanyMacroeconomic situation
The German economy continued its cyclical
recovery in the fourth quarter of 2010.According to the flash estimate released bythe Federal Statistical Office, seasonally andcalendar-adjusted real gross domestic prod-uct (GDP) rose by 0.4% quarter on quarter inthe final three months of 2010, thus display-ing somewhat weaker growth than in thesummer. However, this result probablyunderstates the underlying economic mo-mentum, as the extremely cold and snowywinter weather caused severe disruptions inthe construction and transport sectors inDecember. The rapid upward movement ofthe past 18 months has put the Germaneconomy on course for normal capacity util-isation, and production capacity in some sec-tions of the economy has already exceededaverage utilisation. Overall output at theend of 2010 was 4.0% up on the year incalendar-adjusted terms. This was no morethan 1.4% below the level of output duringthe most recent cyclical peak in the first quar-ter of 2008.
One reason for the favourable overall eco-
nomic situation in Germany is the distinctlyoptimistic sentiment among businesses andconsumers, which has strengthened thedomestic forces of growth. Firms are invest-ing in new plant and equipment, increasingworking hours and recruiting additional staff.As a result, employees’ income is rising andpressure on the labour market is being eased,which is boosting households’ propensity topurchase, thereby providing noticeable im-petus to consumption as well as housingContinuing

46construction. This strong and broadly based
cyclical expansion of the German economy isalso having a knock-on effect on its tradingpartners – especially in the European Union –in the form of higher spending on imports.However, the upturn continues to be sus-tained by buoyant demand for German in-dustrial products, particularly from non-euro-area countries – as is to be expected giventhe openness of the German economy. Thelarge measure of confidence in the Germaneconomy is derived to a major extent fromthe expectation that this trend will continue.
In this situation, the fact that export growth
was probably not as strong in the fourthquarter of 2010 as before did not lead to asignificant slowdown in the pace of economicactivity. According to the foreign trade statis-tics, real exports of goods during the report-
ing period were only
1/4% up on the volume
of the preceding quarter in seasonally adjust-ed terms. This followed an average increaseof 4
1/4% in the first three quarters of 2010.
This slower pace was due, above all, to slug-gish sales to euro-area partner countries. Bycontrast, exports to non-euro-area countriescontinued to expand. Exports to China andthe United States are likely to have increasedmarkedly in the reporting period followingthe hiatus in growth in the third quarter.There was also growth in sales to central andeast European countries. By contrast, thevolume of exports to Japan and the OPECcountries failed to match the high level of thepreceding quarter. This slowdown in exportgrowth affected producers of intermediateand capital goods. In fact, it is likely thatfewer consumer goods were exported in thefinal three months of the year in seasonallyadjusted terms than in the third quarter.
Strong growth in investment in machinery
and equipment again helped to offset themixed quarterly figures for foreign demand inthe reporting quarter. The available indicatorssuggest that one area in which enterprisesare investing is the vehicle fleet. New machin-ery was also procured in large quantities. Inview of the fact that many firms have reachedor, in some cases, even exceeded their plants’normal capacity utilisation, favourable salesforecasts are increasingly raising the issue ofcapacity extensions. The scope for internalfinancing created by the excellent profitabilitysituation and, not least, the discontinuationof declining-balance depreciation rates formovable fixed assets were sufficient reasonsOverall output

47for stepping up fixed asset formation towards
the end of the year. The fact that large-volume capital goods grew more stronglythan IT and electrical equipment points totax-motivated anticipatory effects having amarked influence.
Construction investment would probably also
have supported growth in the fourth quarterof 2010 if the early onset of winter had notconsiderably curtailed construction output inDecember. Measured as an average for Ger-many as whole, there were 17 ice days
1in
December – a number not even remotelymatched in any December during the past40 years and which corresponded to theextreme figure recorded in January of lastyear. Nevertheless, it should be taken intoaccount that the winter break in outsideconstruction work usually begins as early asmid-December. While, in public construction,there is a noticeable gradual decline from theheightened level of output due to the eco-nomic stimulus packages, there has been asteady rise in commercial orders. Added tothis is a perceptible recovery in private hous-ing construction. At all events, the last timethe number of new construction permits forapartments was as high as in the second halfof 2010 was in mid-2006 – in other words,prior to the considerable increase in thestandard rate of VAT.
Private consumption has emerged as another
factor stimulating domestic demand. Themoderate increase in the fourth quarter of2010 is consistent with a slow but steadyrecovery in consumption. In the reportingperiod, retailers benefited, in particular, fromhouseholds’ eagerness to spend in Christmas
trade. This is indicated by the fact that retail-ers, according to the Ifo business survey,were rating their business situation as de-Underlying trends

48cidedly positive in December.2Furthermore,
there was a seasonally adjusted increase insales of new passenger cars in the fourthquarter. As a result of the cold winter wea-ther and heavy snowfalls at the end of theyear, there was, on the one hand, an increasein purchases of heating oil. On the otherhand, the associated restrictions on mobilityled to a reduced consumption of fuel. House-holds’ scope for expenditure has increasedperceptibly on the year owing to the recoveryin actual earnings and the increase in employ-ment. A heightened propensity to consume isindicated by a perceptible decline in the sea-sonally adjusted household saving ratio in thesecond half of 2010 compared with the firsthalf of the year and by the fact that it wasprobably only slightly higher than in 2009.This is likely to be influenced by very optimis-tic income prospects, reflecting the expect-ation of more favourable wage develop-ments.
Imports in the fourth quarter of 2010 failed
to keep step entirely with overall demand.Seasonally adjusted real imports of goodswere an estimated 1
1/2% down on the third
quarter. Given the sharp rise in cost prices,less energy may have been procured for com-mercial purposes at the end of the year.There was also an absence of additional in-ventory cycle impulses. The underlying trendin the procurement of imported intermediategoods is now probably being determined bycurrent production. While there was littlechange in the volume of imported consumergoods compared with the third quarter inseasonally adjusted terms, there was an iden-tifiable increase in imports of capital goods.Given enterprises’ heightened demand for
motor vehicles and machinery, it is not sur-prising that these categories of goods were atthe forefront of growth in imports.
Sectoral trends
Industrial output in the final three months of
2010 was 2
1/2% up on the quarter in season-
ally adjusted terms. In contrast to the firstyear of the cyclical upturn, when output ofintermediate goods showed the largestgrowth, capital goods have now taken thelead. In the reporting quarter, this growthlead was especially marked due to the consid-erable expansion in the production of motorvehicles and machinery. Seasonally adjustedoutput of capital goods showed a 6% in-crease overall, while production of intermedi-ate goods was no higher than in the previousquarter. Consumer goods output was
1/2%
down in the final quarter.
According to the Ifo surveys, average manu-
facturing capacity utilisation in January 2011,at more than 84% of normal full capacity,matched its longer-term average.
3A sharp
increase in output over the past months hasled to capital goods now having reached thisbenchmark, too, whereas capacity utilisationby intermediate and consumer goods pro-ducers essentially remained unchanged. Acombined overview of the cyclical utilisation

consumption.

49indicator and the order-capacity index in the
production-demand scheme suggests thatindustrial activity has now largely overcomethe deep trough of the extremely severerecession.
In seasonally adjusted terms, construction
output in October and November 2010 waswell up on the quite high figure for thesecond and third quarters. The building in-dustry and civil engineering had an equal partin this increase. This was followed in De-cember by a weather-related slump. Naturallyenough, this affected civil engineering(-28
1/4% down on November) more than the
building industry (-211/2%). On a quarterly
average, the construction sector recorded a6
1/4% decline in output compared with the
third quarter.
In the past months, trade has no longer been
benefiting across all subsectors from thecyclical improvement. In seasonally adjustedterms, there has been an underlying trend ofstagnation in real wholesale sales, particularlysince the middle of 2010. There is likely tohave been a fall in turnover for the hotel andrestaurant sector and, in view of the adverseweather conditions at the end of the year, forthe transport sector, too. At all events, inDecember 2010 the mileage of domesticcarriers’ toll-liable vehicles was a seasonallyadjusted 5
3/4% down on the month. By con-
trast, business-related services continued topick up discernibly at the end of the year. Animprovement in assessments of the situationis shown for the fourth quarter by the rele-vant Ifo surveys as well as the ZEW survey onthe ICT-intensive services sector.Employment and labour market
The labour market recovery continued in the
fourth quarter of 2010. According to thefigures of the Federal Statistical Office, theseasonally adjusted number of persons inwork in Germany went up by 98,000, or0.2%, compared with the average of thethird quarter. The vast majority of these wereprobably persons in employment subject tosocial security contributions. The FederalEmployment Agency estimates that theseasonally adjusted number of persons inemployment subject to social security contri-butions was 102,000, or 0.4%, higher inOctober and November than on an averageof the third quarter.

50working exclusively in low-paid part-time
jobs. “One-euro jobs” have been reducedconsiderably over the past few months, how-ever. The debate on the potential “crowding-out” effects of such jobs may have played apart in this.
Almost all sectors of the economy are now
experiencing growth in employment. Like inthe third quarter, only just over one-quarterof the increase in employment subject to
social security contributions was due to tem-porary employment, while the figure for thefirst quarter of 2010 had been as high asone-half. Manufacturing firms increasinglyexpanded their core workforces. Given thepositive outlook for the economy, this strat-egy appears appropriate. Moreover, actualworking hours in large parts of industry arenow at a normal level or higher. In manufac-turing, the average number of hours workedper employee in the fourth quarter of 2010was no longer significantly lower than duringthe most recent cyclical peak in the first quar-ter of 2008. There was also an increase injobs in the business-related services sector.Among public and private services, there wasa sharp increase in jobs in the healthcare andeducation sectors.
The use of short-time working arrangements
for economic reasons showed no more thana slight decline in October and November.The Federal Employment Agency estimatesthat 185,000 persons were still affected inNovember 2010, which is roughly one-eighthof the peak figure during the crisis. There wasa noticeable increase in the number of newlyregistered short-time workers during thereporting period, however. As the cyclicalrecovery is now well advanced across theindustrial sector, this may be an indicationthat those enterprises which fell behindunder the changed market conditions follow-ing the crisis are taking up the extendedoptions for use that are still in place. This isalso suggested by the fact that the number ofshort-time workers is several times higherOutput in industry

51than the level reached during the preceding
upswing.
Unemployment declined only slightly during
the fourth quarter. The official unemploy-ment figure for the fourth quarter of 2010, ata seasonally adjusted 3.15 million, was onlyabout 37,000 lower than in the third quarter.The unemployment rate fell by 0.1 per-centage point to 7.5%. The decline tookplace predominantly among recipients ofunemployment insurance benefits. Duringthe economic recovery, recipients of un-employment benefit II have also increasinglyfound new employment, however. SinceNovember, the number of persons receivingbasic social benefits has nevertheless alsobeen increasing again. The key factor behindthis is likely to be the massive reduction in“one-euro” jobs. Even so, in comparison withofficial unemployment, underemploymentas recorded by the Federal Labour Agency– which is based on supply in the primarylabour market and therefore includes allpersons involved in labour market policymeasures – was falling without any loss ofmomentum up to the end of the periodunder review, which suggests a continuingperceptible cyclical effect. Official unemploy-ment in the fourth quarter was 276,000down on the year. Underemployment – ex-cluding short-time work, for which quarterlydata are not yet available – fell by as much as389,000 compared with the same period of2009. After the start of the year, the season-ally adjusted official unemployment rateshowed a further fall, standing at 7.4% inJanuary 2011.

52According to leading indicators, the outlook
for the labour market remains very positive.The seasonally adjusted number of vacancieshad shown a further increase by January2011 and was already higher than theaverage for the “boom year” of 2007.The growth rate in vacancies in the manufac-turing, trade, and logistics sectors as well asin business-related services (which includestemporary employment) was especially high.The level of resident temporary workersmight soon be dampened by temporary workagencies increasingly establishing branches inthe new EU member states – especially inPoland – in preparation for the complete freemovement of workers from the EU accessioncountries starting in May 2011. Staff maythen be recruited in those countries for em-ployment in Germany. The Ifo employmentbarometer, which provides information onpersonnel planning in trade and industry overthe next three months, showed a furthersharp rise from the peak reached in the finalquarter of 2010.
Wages and prices
In the 2011 pay round, the trade unions are
focusing on pushing through wage increases.The scale of the pay claims, ranging from 5%to 7% depending on sector, is considerableoverall. Firms’ positive orders situation alongwith employers’ willingness to compensatetheir employees for losses of income duringthe crisis might result in comparatively highagreed rates of pay. This is reflected in thelatest collective pay settlement for Volks-wagen, which (including one-off payments)provides for a large wage increase this year
but, with an eye to the long-term cost bur-den, remains within reasonable bounds.
In the final quarter of last year, pay rate in-
creases were nevertheless still being shapedfor the most part by the pay agreements con-cluded during the crisis; at most, these pro-vided for moderate rises in wages and salar-ies. The Bundesbank’s pay rate statistics showthat the increases in negotiated rates of pay,at 1.5% on the year, were no longer quite asmoderate as in the third quarter (+1.1%). For2010, this gives an average increase in nego-tiated rates of pay of 1.6%, compared with2.0% in 2009.
4Actual earnings in 2010 in-
creased by an average of 2.2% year on year.The wage drift on a monthly basis turnedpositive and amounted to 0.6 percentagepoint, compared with -2.2 percentage pointsin the crisis year of 2009. The sharp decline inshort-time work and extended working hoursare the key reasons for this reversal of thesituation. Against this backdrop, the wagedrift on an hourly basis changed sign and, at-1.8 percentage points, was in negative terri-tory last year.
At the beginning of 2011, the generally bind-
ing minimum wages for the waste disposalsector,
5electricians, office cleaners and the
roofing industry were raised by an average ofroughly 2%. Negotiations are currently tak-
4The growth rate for basic pay including lump-sum and
one-off payments amounts to 1.7%, which comes quite
close to the comparable negotiated pay index of the WSI
(1.8%), which, however, excludes civil servants. The Fed-
eral Statistical Office, whose index likewise excludes civil
servants, reports an increase of 1.6% for the basic nego-
tiated rates of pay.

53ing place in the political sphere concerning
the introduction of a minimum wage in thetemporary labour sector. This is due to fearsthat complete freedom of movement forworkers within the EU from May 2011 (withthe exception of Bulgaria and Romania)might lead to competitive wage undercuttingby central and east European personnel re-cruitment agencies.
The price climate in Germany deteriorated
noticeably in the fourth quarter of 2010. Thiswas due essentially to a sharp acceleration inthe prices of energy, industrial commoditiesand food on the world markets in the wakeof the global upturn, which were reflectedmainly in higher inflation rates at the up-stream stages of sales and production. Im-ports were 2.7% more expensive in seasonal-ly adjusted terms compared with the previousquarter. There were particularly marked in-creases in the case of energy (11.5%) andintermediate goods (2.3%). Although theprice increase for consumer goods was com-paratively moderate at 0.6%, the rise wasnevertheless noticeably sharper than its long-er-term trend. It was only the prices of capitalgoods that eased again somewhat for thefirst time in a long while. By and large, thispattern is also apparent in German industry’sdomestic and export sales prices, albeit withsmaller amplitudes in most cases. This led toa marked deterioration in the terms of trade.
This accelerated increase in prices is, to a con-
siderable extent, the result of prices returningto their pre-crisis levels. As with the recoveryof the real economy, this is being accom-panied temporarily by higher rates of priceincrease. Import prices in the final quarter of
2010 were back at their pre-crisis level. Ifenergy is excluded, import prices werealready well above their level before the crisis.Much the same applies to export prices. Thedepreciation of the euro against the curren-cies of major trading partners is likely to haveplayed a part in this. Despite sharp rates ofincrease, domestic sales prices of industrialproducts were, on the whole, still below theirlevel prior to the crisis; if energy is excluded,they were higher than before the crisis.
Despite the pick-up in construction activity,
the rise in construction prices was moderate.They were 0.3% up on the quarter and 1.5%on the year. According to the figures of theAssociation of German Pfandbrief Banks ( Ver-
band deutscher Pfandbriefbanken, vdp), the

For the ﬁ  rst time in years, house pri ces in Germany rose 
noti ceably a gain in 2010. A ccording to Bun desbank 
calculations base d on Bulwien Gesa A G data, there was 
a 2½ % in crease on the year in the pri ces of new an d 
existin g semi- deta ched houses as well as of owner-
occupie d apartments durin g the reportin g perio d. The 
pri ces of new properties rose more sharply than those 
of existin g properties. There was a comparatively 
marke d in crease in the pri ces of new owner-o ccupie d 
apartments, in parti cular, whilst the pri ces of new 
semi- deta ched houses an d existin g owner-o ccupie d 
apartments went up mo derately an d existin g semi-
deta ched houses cost only mar ginally more. There 
was a very sharp rise in the pri ce of owner-o ccupie d 
apartments in ur ban areas (5 %).1
Other in dicators conﬁ rm the basi c con clusion of an 
upwar d tren d in pri ces, althou gh differen ces in the 
scale of the in crease are to be seen in the context of 
statisti cal measurin g un certainties. A ccording to the 
annual results of the Asso ciation of German Pfan dbrief 
Banks ( Verband deuts cher Pfandbriefbanken , vdp), the 
pri ces of owner-o ccupie d housin g went up by 0. 6% 
in 2010. The pri ces of resi dential housin g in crease d 
somewhat more sharply (+0.7 %) than those of owner-
occupie d apartments (+0.2 %). However, the upwar d 
pressure on pri ces a ccelerate d signiﬁ cantly over the 
year, espe cially in the case owner-o ccupie d apart-
ments. A ccording to the he doni c house pri ce in dices 
pu blishe d by Hypoport A G, new resi dential buildings 
recorded the sharpest rise in pri ces (3¼ %), whereas 
the pri ces of existin g owner-o ccupie d apartments an d 
semi- deta ched houses went up less sharply at +2½ % 
and +2 % respe ctively.2
The re cent in crease in resi dential property pri ces is 
likely to have been the result of a pi ck-up in deman d in 
the housin g market owin g to the current ex ceptionally favoura ble ﬁ nan cing con ditions. The overall optimisti c 
sentiment an d the si gniﬁ cant improvement in the 
labour market outlook are also likely to have playe d a 
part in this. By contrast, the resi dent population ha d a 
more dampenin g effe ct. Given that new constru ction 
activity has been su bdued for a num ber of years, the 
supply si de has now a djuste d to stru ctural deman d to 
such an extent that even mo derate deman d impulses 
can tri gger conspi cuous pri ce rea ctions.3
Househol ds were re ceivin g mort gage loans at his-

at an avera ge rate of 3. 6%, thus un dershootin g the

The pri ce rea ction on the housin g market was a ccom-

housing continued: following a 0.7% in-crease in the third quarter, they went up by0.6% in the final three months of the year.There was a year-on-year increase of 1.5%.(For a review of 2010 as a whole, see the boxon pages 54-55.)
Consumer price inflation accelerated signifi-
cantly towards the end of 2010. Prices in-creased by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% com-pared with the third quarter. The unfavour-able weather conditions played a part in this.Seasonal food products were a seasonally ad-justed 3.3% more expensive than in the thirdquarter. The weather is also likely to havebeen a factor behind the sharp increase inthe prices of heating oil and fuel, which aver-aged 7%. In the case of other goods and ser-vices, the increase remained within narrowbounds. Overall, consumer prices were 1.5%higher year on year.
At the beginning of 2011, there was a further
acceleration in the rate of inflation to 2.0%(according to the national CPI and the HICP).Given the higher prices in the internationalagricultural and energy markets and the pick-up in economic activity, it is unlikely that therates of price increases will moderate signifi-cantly over the next few months.

are benefiting from their presence in stronglyexpanding markets outside Europe, particu-larly as the pace of economic recovery in theUnited States has picked up significantly oflate. Impulses from the euro area are likely toremain fairly muted, however. As this salesmarket is of considerable importance for theGerman economy, a certain degree of slow-down in economic activity cannot be ruledout if orders from this region remain weak.

from euro-area partner countries (leavingaside the large order last August) were largelymoving sideways.

many itself. In the fourth quarter, producersof capital goods received fewer orders fromthe rest of the euro area, whereas domesticorders for machinery, vehicles and equipmentshowed a seasonally adjusted increase of5
1/4%. The sharp increase in orders for these
goods received from countries outside theeuro area was, in fact, even more marked atsomewhat more than +10% on the thirdquarter. Demand for intermediate goods roseonly moderately in the reporting period(+
3/4%), with the slowdown affecting all the
regions. By contrast, consumer goods were insomewhat greater demand in the fourthquarter (+
3/4%), compared with -11/2% in the
preceding three-month period.
This regained dynamic in the flow of orders is
consistent with the extremely optimistic senti-ment in manufacturing. According to theIfo surveys, the business climate showed afurther marked improvement at the begin-ning of 2011. To a large extent, firms arebasing their expectations on exports. Domes-tic factors appear to be playing a key role,too, however. According to the Ifo Invest-ment Survey and the latest survey by theGerman Chamber of Industry and Commerce(DIHK), industrial enterprises, in particular,want to significantly step up their investmentin new production facilities in the currentyear. This suggests that the increase in fixedcapital formation is being accompanied by anongoing rise in the need for labour. The in-crease in the number of reported vacanciesand the relevant current survey findings are
likewise positive evidence of this. As a resultof integration effects, the trade sector andtransport as well as business-related serviceswill probably benefit from the continuing up-turn in industrial activity.
Enterprises’ plans for expansion should give
an additional boost to commercial construc-tion. Orders from industry received by theconstruction sector in October and November2010 were a seasonally adjusted 1

the average of the third quarter, in whichthere had been growth of

Private consumption is likely to continue sup-

Households are optimistic in view ofthe upturn on the labour market and the pro-spect of sizeable growth in earnings.

59Public finances* General government budget
Public finances in Germany developed more
favourably in 2010 than had been anticipatedat the height of the crisis. However, thisshould not mask the existence of substantialfiscal problems and the need for large-scaleadjustment. According to initial data fromthe Federal Statistical Office, the general gov-ernment deficit ratio rose to 3.5%, althoughthe buoyant economy and positive one-offeffects significantly eased the burden on pub-lic coffers (see box on pages 60 and 61). Thisrise was predominantly due to the consider-able structural deterioration stemming fromexpansionary fiscal measures, but the assist-ance provided to financial institutions alsodrove up the deficit perceptibly. Furthermore,the debt ratio reached a new high at the endof 2010, estimated at well over 80%. Thevery sharp increase can be attributed mainlyto the assumption of risk assets and liabilitiesby the government sector in connection withsetting up resolution agencies for parts ofHypo Real Estate (HRE) and WestLB.
The government revenue ratio fell by 1.4 per-
centage points to 43.1 % in 2010. Fiscalmeasures were a major contributory factor inthis decrease (particularly the greater tax de-ductibility of insurance contributions and theeconomic stimulus packages), while in thearea of social security funds, shortfalls arisingfrom the lower general contribution rate to

60Deutsche BundesbankThe structural development of public finances in Germany
– results of the disaggregated framework for 2010 –
According to provisional data from the Federal
Statistical Office, the general government deficitin Germany (as defined in the national accounts)increased to 3.5% of gross domestic product(GDP) in 2010 after it had stood at 3.0% in theprevious year. Using the disaggregated frame-work for analysing public finances,
1it is possible,
firstly, to estimate the role played by cyclical andspecific temporary effects and, secondly, to iden-tify other changes, referred to here as structuralchanges, in the revenue and expenditure ratiosand their major determinants. The main resultsof this analysis for 2010 are presented below.
2
The results show that, taken in isolation, favour-able cyclical influences caused a decline in thedeficit ratio of 0.4 percentage point. The effectis considerably lower than suggested by thestrong increase in GDP, as important macroeco-nomic reference variables for government rev-enue (gross wages and salaries, private con-sumption) grew at a much weaker pace. In add-ition, clearly identifiable specific temporary ef-fects (including the proceeds from the radio fre-quency auction and higher insolvency benefitcontributions) reduced the deficit by 0.2 per-centage point.
3Hence, the 2010 deficit – adjust-
ed for these cyclical and specific temporary ef-fects and in relation to trend-GDP – increasedconsiderably by 1.1 percentage points.
While the unadjusted revenue ratio fell very
markedly by 1.4 percentage points, the declinein the structural ratio (structural revenue in rela-tion to trend-GDP) was more moderate (-0.7 per-centage point). The determining factor for the
weaker decline was that the short-term changesto the growth structure are not reflected in thestructural ratio as it is geared towards longer-term assessment base trends. The trend growthrates of the macroeconomic reference variablesthat are particularly important for public fi-nances even exceeded those of GDP, which hada slight ratio-boosting effect (positive decoup-ling of the assessment bases) of +0.2 percentagepoint. By contrast, legislative changes caused asharp reduction in the ratio (-0.9 percentagepoint). This was mainly attributable to tax cuts(especially greater tax deductibility of insurancecontributions, economic stimulus packages).Added to this was the lowering in the generalcontribution rate to the statutory health insur-ance scheme on 1 July 2009, the full annual ef-fect of which was not felt until 2010.
The unadjusted expenditure ratio decreased by
0.9 percentage point in 2010, while the ratio ofstructural expenditure (to the more stabletrend-GDP) increased by 0.5 percentage point.Public finances profited from a further slight de-cline in the interest expenditure ratio which wasattributable to the very favourable financingconditions.
4The structural ratio of other ex-
penditure (primary expenditure) went up by 0.6percentage point. Social payments shot upowing to the further increase in child benefit aswell as the relatively strong rise in expenditureon healthcare and old-age provision. In contrastto this, the decline in labour market expenditureas well as the expiration of the child bonus and

61the car scrappage scheme, which was recorded
in this item, had a dampening effect on the in-crease. In addition to social payments, the cap-ital transfers in connection with the support ofHypo Real Estate were also partly responsible forthe growth in the structural expenditure ratio.
Overall, it is apparent that there is a consider-
able structural deterioration in public finances,which has, however, been partly obscured by fa-vourable cyclical development and other tem-
porary relief effects. The increase in the struc-tural deficit is largely the result of extensive taxmeasures, relatively strong growth in expend-iture on social benefits and financial market sup-port measures.

62the statutory health insurance scheme and
additional revenue from raising insolvencybenefit contributions largely cancelled eachother out. The decline in the ratio is alsoattributable to the fact that gross wages andsalaries and private consumption, both ofwhich are important reference variables forrevenue, grew at a much weaker pace thangross domestic product (GDP).As a result of economic recovery, the govern-
ment expenditure ratio dropped to 46.6%from 47.5%, after soaring by 3.7 percentagepoints in 2009. These fluctuations largelymirror the cyclical development of GDP in theratio’s denominator. The cyclically-adjustedexpenditure ratio went up for the third yearin a row. In particular, the effects of the fur-ther increase in child benefit, the relativelystrong rise in spending on healthcare servicesand the higher capital transfers owing to sup-port measures for HRE were felt in 2010. Bycontrast, the expiry of the car scrappagescheme and the child bonus, as well as theproceeds received in May from the auctionof radio frequencies, all had an alleviatingeffect.

The deficit ratio could potentially drop to-wards 2% in 2011, provided (as is assumedhere) the burdens arising from the financialmarket support measures decline and alllevels of government initiate the correctionsnecessary, not least to comply with budgetaryrules. Continued positive economic develop-ments are likely to support a decline in thedeficit. Furthermore, following two years of avery expansionary fiscal policy stance, fiscalmeasures are depressing the deficit on bal-ance. Various economic stimuli – for example,in the area of active labour market policyor lowering the contribution rate to the un-employment insurance scheme – are beingphased out.

63made in connection with the Federal Govern-
ment’s consolidation package from the sum-mer of 2010. Furthermore, the contributionrate to the statutory health insurance schemehas been raised and the healthcare reformcould dampen growth in expenditure. A con-tinuation of the favourable labour market de-velopment could also contribute to a struc-tural improvement.
Despite the expected reduction in the deficit,
fiscal policymakers still face a huge restruc-turing task, as is abundantly clear from cen-tral, state and local government budgets.The medium-term objective of a structurallyclose-to-balance budget is still a long way off.The debt ratio has exceeded the 60% refer-ence value ever since 2002. It rose very sharp-ly again during the crisis, even though itshould be borne in mind that the rise is large-ly offset by an increase in financial assets inconnection with financial market supportmeasures. However, overall, the burdenplaced on future generations has increasedsignificantly. Furthermore, during the finan-cial and sovereign debt crisis, Germany as-sumed substantial risks from guarantees,which should by no means be disregarded.Against this backdrop, concessions in termsof the planned consolidation are not advis-able. Instead, the better performance interms of national and European budgetaryrules should be used to implement budgetaryconsolidation as planned, taking advantageof the current very positive conditions toreduce deficits more quickly.
Confidence in the soundness of public fi-
nances remains extremely strained in severaleuro-area countries. The corresponding risk
premiums mean that these countries can onlytap the capital market for funds at high inter-est rates or that they require financial assist-ance. Action will be required primarily fromthe stricken countries themselves to improvethis situation on a sustainable basis by elimin-ating the root causes of the problem. Theyneed to rapidly lower their government def-icits, restructure their financial systems andimplement comprehensive structural reformsto enhance economic growth. Financial as-sistance from other countries can at most buytime to allow the necessary adjustment pro-cesses to be spread over a longer period. Asthings currently stand, the euro rescue shieldagreed in May 2010 would appear to providea sufficient range of instruments.
Nonetheless, the possibility of adding new
instruments to the rescue package, whichruns to 2013, is currently being floated. Onedemand is that the European Financial Stabil-ity Facility (EFSF) should buy up governmentbonds of the affected countries on the sec-ondary market. That would, however, ab-solve private sector creditors and nationalpolicymakers of even more of their responsi-bility and possibly result in the taxpayers inthe financing countries having to shouldermore and potentially large-scale risks. Bondbuybacks by the country itself using low-costloans extended by the EFSF are being pro-posed, as is the idea that bonds acquired bythe EFSF cheaply should be passed on to thedebtor country below par. In economic terms,this would, like the reduction of the agreedinterest rate conditions, involve an additional,intransparent intergovernmental transfer.

64Deutsche BundesbankTowards a European Stability Mechanism
In the context of the European Council meeting on
16-17 December 2010, the euro-area member states
agreed to establish a permanent mechanism to sa-
feguard the financial stability of the euro area as a
whole. This future European Stability Mechanism
(ESM) will replace the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stabilisa-
tion Mechanism (EFSM), both of which are to re-
main in force until June 2013. In this context, the
European Council decided to amend Article 136 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union (TFEU) accordingly; as of 1 January 2013, a
new, third paragraph is to be added with the follo-
wing wording: “The Member States whose cur-
rency is the euro may establish a stability mecha-
nism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard
the stability of the euro area as a whole. The gran-
ting of any required financial assistance under the
mechanism will be made subject to strict conditio-
nality.”
Like the EFSF, the ESM is to be established on the
basis of an intergovernmental agreement. All
decision-making powers regarding assistance mea-
sures designed to safeguard the financial stability
of the euro area as a whole therefore rest with the
member states. The European Union will not un-
dertake any further financial involvement of its
own in this area and the EFSM, as an instrument
established under Union law, will cease to exist in
June 2013. Upon its introduction in May 2010, the
EFSM was explicitly based on the derogation provi-
ded for in Article 122 (2) of the TFEU. In its conclu-
sions of 16-17 December 2010, the European Coun-
cil thus agreed that Article 122 (2) of the TFEU will
no longer be needed for the purposes in question.
Article 136 of the TFEU was incorporated into pri-
mary Union law through the Treaty of Lisbon in
December 2009 and forms part of a chapter on spe-
cial provisions for member states whose currency is
the euro. It allows these member states to coordi-
nate their fiscal policy above and beyond the provi-
sions of general EU law. Article 136 (1) and (2) ofthe TFEU in its current wording also offers specific
procedures for this purpose based in Union law.
Conversely, the text of the planned amendment,
which refers to the possibility of setting up the Eu-
ropean Stability Mechanism, makes no provisions
for any procedural rules. This can be explained by
the clear commitment to an intergovernmentally
established ESM in the conclusions of the European
Council. Moreover, the decision in favour of the
simplified procedure for revising the provisions of
Part Three of the TFEU pursuant to Article 48 (6) of
the Treaty on European Union (TEU) is also connec-
ted with the intergovernmental nature of the ESM.
Such a simplified revision procedure may be ap-
plied only if competences already assigned to the
European Union are not expanded as a result of
the amendment and, accordingly, no new responsi-
bilities are transferred to Union level. In this sense,
the new Article 136 (3) of the TFEU merely confirms
the existence of an option available to member sta-
tes on account of their individual sovereignty to
act within the framework of their financial auto-
nomy.
The choice of wording for the revision and exten-
sion of Article 136 of the TFEU reflects some impor-
tant decisions taken by the European Council with
regard to the architecture of the future European
Stability Mechanism. First, the wording stresses the
need for there to be a risk to the stability of the
euro area as a whole as opposed to turmoil that is
restricted to one or a few member states. Second,
the fact that the ESM is to be activated only when
such action is indispensable emphasises that other
possible solutions are to be given priority. The ad-
ditional stipulation that the granting of any requi-
red financial assistance under the mechanism is to
be made subject to stringent conditions enshrines
in Union law the requisite strict conditionality atta-
ched to all such assistance.
Furthermore, the European Council’s conclusions
set out further key elements of the decision-
making structure and design of the new mecha-

65nism. For instance, they contain the explicit requi-
rement that the mechanism be activated by mutual
agreement of the euro-area member states. This re-
presents a continuation of the EFSF rule that each
country providing financial assistance has to agree
to this action, thus ensuring that the individual
member states retain decision-making authority
over their own finances. The intergovernmental
nature of the arrangement is also emphasised by
the fact that EU member states whose currency is
not the euro may participate in measures taken un-
der the future mechanism on an ad hoc basis, as
was the case with the Irish rescue package, which
included bilateral loans from the United Kingdom,
Sweden and Denmark.
Moreover, the European Council took on board
the declarations in the statement made by the Eu-
rogroup finance ministers on 28 November 2010
stipulating that the future ESM will be based on
the current EFSF and will function according to the
EFSF’s rules. In this context, one particularly impor-
tant aspect is the absence of joint and several liabi-
lity for all exposures. Instead, liability corresponds
to individual shares for which there are absolute
size limits. In addition, the funds borrowed on the
financial market are to be relayed to the financially
distressed member state in the form of loans. As
with the Greek assistance, the due interest is to be
supplemented by processing costs and an appro-
priate margin. The credit conditions are elaborated
by the European Commission – in this case acting
on behalf of the member states – in liaison with
the ECB and the IMF; in line with the requirement
for strict conditionality, they contain an economic
adjustment programme to which the member state
receiving assistance commits.
The agreement concerning concrete modifications
to the EFSF rules effective in October 2010 was like-
wise taken on board by the European Council.
They are designed to provide for a case-by-case
participation of private creditors in full compliance
with IMF guidelines. Any provison of financial assi-stance is preceded by a “debt sustainability analysis
conducted by the European Commission and the
IMF, in liaison with the ECB.” Where this analysis
concludes that the member state in question is sol-
vent, private creditors are to be encouraged to
maintain their exposure in line with IMF practices.
However, if the completed debt sustainability ana-
lysis deems a country to be insolvent, ie over-
indebted and carrying an unsustainable debt bur-
den, the member state in question has to negotiate
a comprehensive restructuring plan with its private
sector creditors in line with IMF practices with a
view to restoring debt sustainability. Only once
debt sustainability has been achieved through
these measures may the ESM provide liquidity assi-
stance.
In order to facilitate the participation of private
creditors, standardised and identical collective ac-
tion clauses (CACs) will be included in the terms
and conditions of all new euro-area sovereign
bonds starting in June 2013. This will enable the
creditors to pass a qualified majority decision
agreeing a legally binding change to the terms of
payment (standstill, extension of the maturity, in-
terest rate cut and/or haircut) for all creditors. It
will also prevent individual creditors from refusing
to sign up to an agreement in the hope that they
might secure more favourable conditions for them-
selves (the “free rider” problem). A further key
change to the current EFSF rules is that the ESM
loans are to be given preferred creditor status and
are thus senior to all private creditors’ claims and
junior only to IMF loans. This clear signal to the
markets is aimed at safeguarding public funds and
thus ultimately protecting taxpayers in the coun-
tries providing assistance. By contrast, neither the
current EFSF nor the European Council’s conclusi-
ons with regard to the future ESM envisage capital
accumulation at these institutions, the option to
purchase government bonds on the secondary mar-
ket or programmes which can be activated in ad-
vance of the onset of payment difficulties.

66In order to be able to better prevent similar
sovereign debt crises occurring in the future,distortions must be detected at an earlierstage and more decisive action taken tocorrect them. In addition to strengtheningthe Stability and Growth Pact, extendingmacroeconomic surveillance of serious distor-tions and improving the regulation and super-vision of financial markets, the discipliningeffect of the financial markets also plays animportant role in this context. It is thereforeessential that the incentives for creditorsto adequately price risk, thereby ensuring asound fiscal policy, are by no means reduced,but are instead increased in future.
This is also an issue with the future European
Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is to be setup lest intensified prevention measures proveinsufficient. At the end of November 2010,the euro-area finance ministers establishedimportant cornerstones for the ESM, whichthe European Council confirmed in December(see also the box on pages 64 and 65). TheESM will accordingly be based on the EFSF inits current form. Financial assistance is per-mitted only if the stability of the euro-area asa whole is at risk and is to be conditional on astringent economic and fiscal programme ofadjustment. In the event of a liquidity crisis,private sector creditors are to be encouragedto maintain their exposure while, in the eventof insolvency, private sector creditors and therespective debtor country must reach a com-prehensive agreement on restoring debt sus-tainability as a condition for financial assist-ance. To protect the taxpayers in the coun-tries providing assistance, ESM loans are tobe given preferred creditor status and themechanism is to take the form of a bilateral
agreement in which decisions regarding sup-port measures are unanimously agreed by thecountries providing assistance. At present,negotiations are ongoing with the objectiveof finalising the mechanism by March. Someof the proposals being discussed – for ex-ample involving secondary market purchases,extending joint liability (Eurobonds) or per-ceptibly lowering the interest charged onESM loans – reduce incentives for sound fiscalpolicy and contravene important basic prin-ciples of the currency union such as subsidiar-ity, national fiscal responsibility and the nobail-out principle (see the box on pages 68and 69).

68Deutsche BundesbankThe debate on secondary market purchases by the future European Stability Mechanism
After the European Council established the cor-
nerstones for the European Stability Mechanism(ESM) in December 2010, the concrete imple-mentation details are currently being discussedwith a view to a European Council decision inMarch. One proposal under consideration is forthe future mechanism to allow secondary mar-ket purchases of government bonds of a countryin distress. This includes the suggestion of sover-eign debt buybacks financed via ESM loans. Themain envisaged objectives are to involve privatesector creditors in crisis resolution, stabilise bondprices, provide aid to countries requesting assist-ance, improve conditions for primary market is-suance and to safeguard financial market stabil-ity.
However, if secondary market purchases were to
be allowed, this would imply a move away fromthe principle agreed by the Eurogroup ministerson 28 November 2010 (and endorsed by theEuropean Council in December) to base thefunctionality of the future ESM on the design ofthe EFSF from November 2010, as this instrumentis not part of the EFSF. Moreover, the proposalappears questionable on economic grounds andits concrete implementation would raise seriousproblems inter alia regarding price-setting, pur-
chase volume and transparency.
A fundamental misgiving is that the secondary
market purchases under discussion would meanintervening in the market process and thus dis-torting prices and incentives. The creditors ofthe country in question would benefit from thisarrangement as their exposure would be re-duced and, as a result, the risks that they as-sumed previously would be transferred to thecountries providing assistance or to any other
existing private sector creditors. If indirect or dir-ect buybacks of debt of a country receiving as-sistance were allowed as well,
1this would
amount to a transfer to this country whichwould be all the higher, the lower the interestrate charged for the buyback loan.
As a rule, the only way to permanently lower
the risk premium which the markets charge ascompensation for default risk, and which largelydetermines interest rate levels and bond prices,is to improve expectations of the long-term sus-tainability of a country’s public debt and thusalso of its contracted debt servicing. The key pre-requisite for gaining the trust of potential cred-itors is that the adjustment process, in the senseof a substantial improvement in the generalgovernment primary balance, is considered cred-ible (for instance, because it is largely complete)and that the escalation of the country’s indebt-edness is halted and seems likely to be reversedin the near future.
Buybacks of bonds that are being traded below
their face value would result in an ad hoc nom-
inal reduction in the debt ratio of the countryrequiring assistance. However, the size of the re-duction would be limited and the primary bal-ance adjustment requirement would be easedonly marginally. For instance, repurchasing 50%of an outstanding sovereign debt amounting to150% of GDP at an average market price of thebonds of 80% of their face value would cut thedebt ratio by a mere 15 percentage points innominal terms.
2This would probably reduce the
medium-term consolidation requirement by lessthan 1% of GDP in many cases, which would be

and finance them using low-interest ESM loans. On the other hand,bonds purchased by the ESM at a low price could be passed on to thedebtor country, resulting in an ESM claim on the country concerned

69highly unlikely to dispel market doubts notice-
ably. Conversely, if assistance programmes werelaunched on a sufficiently large scale to reducethe distressed country’s debt ratio significantly,market concerns would refocus on the associ-ated huge burden incurred by the assistingcountries. This danger is especially evident giventhat, in order to ensure equal treatment, suchan arrangement would have to be granted to allcountries experiencing serious payment difficul-ties. Furthermore, the (hidden) transfer associ-ated with such buyback programmes would gen-erally reduce incentives for recipient countriesto pursue an appropriate fiscal policy. Whilestates with an unsound budgetary policy couldcount on receiving assistance, countries withsound finances would be called on to provide fi-nancing.
Moreover, lower interest rates resulting from
secondary market purchases are irrelevant fornew borrowing by countries that are benefitingfrom an assistance programme because they aregenerally financed by means of ESM loans forthe period considered necessary for stabilisationand are thus not reliant on capital market bor-rowing. For countries that are not benefitingfrom an assistance programme, secondary mar-ket purchases would contravene the principlethat financial assistance may only be provided ifthe stability of the euro area as a whole is at riskand if a tough economic and fiscal policy adjust-ment programme is in place.
If secondary market purchases were to contrib-
ute to supporting the market price of sovereignbonds of the country requesting assistance, thiswould benefit bond sellers and might temporar-ily reduce existing private sector creditors’ write-
downs. However, this kind of financial marketsupport would be totally unfocused and thuscostly. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out thatprecisely those institutions that are especially vul-nerable would choose not to reduce their bondportfolios even at a higher price so as to avoidthe requisite need for write-downs, and so mightnot benefit at all. Moreover, this very broad formof financial market support would carry no con-ditions for financial institutions, with the resultthat they might ignore or underestimate the riskof their exposure ex ante and hence that market
mechanisms would be weakened.
However, it is also possible that given the pre-
ferred status of ESM loans – which is a crucial re-quirement from the perspective of taxpayers inthe countries providing assistance – secondarymarket purchases may actually trigger a fall inbond prices. This is because purchases would in-flate the risks for any remaining private sectorcreditors of the country receiving assistance. Thiscould heighten the pressure to sell and thuslower prices. If the remaining bonds do not havea wide float, then secondary market purchasescould even jeopardise financial stability.
All in all, it appears doubtful whether the ob-
jectives set out by the European Council in De-cember would be adequately taken into consid-eration if the ESM is given the opportunity ofintervening directly or indirectly in the sovereignbond market of countries with solvency prob-lems. In any case, this would contravene import-ant basic principles of the currency union such assubsidiarity, national fiscal responsibility and theno bail-out rule.
market interest rates. In all other cases (assuming the maturity of the
loan is the same), this merely constitutes swapping a bond with ahigh nominal value and a low interest coupon for a loan with a lowernominal value and a higher interest rate, which in terms of present
value is the same.

72lion10subtracted from this figure. This would
produce a structural deficit for 2010 ofaround €38 billion (or just under 1.6% ofGDP), which ought to form the base value forthe following years.
11In order to comply with
the provision of a gradual reduction up to2016, the limit for structural new borrowingwould then be around €33 billion in 2011and approximately €29 billion in 2012.
However, the 2011 budget was based on an
upper limit derived from an outdated esti-mate from summer 2010, which is just over€12 billion higher. Keeping this inflated value,thereby creating additional scope for govern-ment borrowing during the rest of the transi-tional period too, would clearly violate thelegislative intent of the debt brake, which isunambiguously documented. The plannedreduction path should therefore be corrected,not least with regard to the 2012 draftbudget to be drawn up this spring and therelated financial plan up to 2015,
12in order
to ensure the necessary fiscal policy consist-ency in the period of consolidation up to2016.
The 2011 budget plan envisages net borrow-
ing of €48
1/2billion. Compared with the
actual value recorded for 2010, this stillconstitutes a rise in planned structural netborrowing of around €3 billion. Even the oldborrowing limit based on investment expend-iture, which was regarded as not strictenough, would still be overshot by €12 billiondespite the rapid economic recovery and thefact that the previous exemption clause couldno longer be invoked. However, if the out-come for 2010, which is much more favour-able than previously forecast, particularly in
the case of tax revenue and interest expend-iture, is carried forward into 2011, a signifi-cant improvement in the result is expected,provided no deficit-boosting measures aretaken in the short term. It would therefore bepossible to achieve a structural deficit thatalso complies with the updated reductionpath. Given that the deficit is still extremelyhigh, the resolute reduction of structural netborrowing must remain a top priority. Anyconcessions in terms of the planned consoli-dation measures would be unacceptable be-fore the prescribed target for 2016 isachieved. The new German budgetary rulesare also being widely observed at an inter-national level and the Federal Government iscampaigning for similar rules to be imple-mented in other euro-area members states.This makes it all the more important for theprovisions to be rigorously implemented at anational level.
The deficit of central government’s off-
budget entities fell by €14 billion to €7 billion
10At EU level, the cyclical adjustment procedure was
changed to a modified estimation method with effect
from autumn 2010. Central government is likely to
change its national budgetary rules accordingly. See also
Deutsche Bundesbank, Requirements regarding the cyclic-
al adjustment procedure under the new debt rule, Month-
ly Report, January 2011, pp 55-60. If the new cyclical ad-
justment procedure were to be used, the cyclically-in-
duced budgetary burden would be somewhat greater.
11The debt limit is not tied to the deficit, but to net bor-
rowing, which is regularly lower by the amount of coin
seigniorage.
12See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), op cit, p 56.
Possible differential amounts arising from an inflated
scope for borrowing not being exhausted would be
credited to the control account. These amounts would
therefore not be available when drawing up a budget
that complies with the constitutional requirements, but
could be used to offset any future deviations from the
budget plan that lead to the deficit limit being overshot.
This would also ultimately result in an increased scope for
new borrowing.Deficit limit

Even if delays in the outflow offunds are taken into account, the investmentprogramme triggered only a very moderateincrease in output during the acute crisis.

The majority of the stimulus impulses cameduring the recovery phase and therefore,from an economic policy perspective, appearto no longer be required. The Special Fundfor Financial Market Stabilisation (SoFFin),whose guarantee and remaining loan author-isations were largely transferred to the Re-structuring Fund (a new special fund) whenthe period of assistance expired at the end of2010, recorded a deficit of €2

2010. A marked decline in capital transfers tocredit institutions resulted in a drop of €14billion on the year. The extensive assumptionof liability in connection with bad banks is notreflected in the cash deficit until there is anactual outflow of funds, meaning that thetransfer of exposures to the resolution agen-cies of WestLB and HRE has not yet had animpact on the deficit.

State government’s core budgets recorded a
deficit of €211/2billion in 2010, compared
with €251/2billion one year previously. After
adjustment for the exceptional burden arisingfrom the recapitalisation of BayernLB in2009, which no longer had an impact, thiscorresponds to a €3 billion deterioration inthe fiscal balance. Nevertheless, the deficitresult was considerably more favourable thanthe figure of €34
1/2billion estimated in the
budget plans. Revenue rose by 2% overallvis-à-vis 2009. This was mainly attributable toboth tax receipts, which – in addition to thecompensation for the transfer of motor ve-hicle tax receipts to central government inmid-2009 – rose by 2%, and transfers fromthe Investment and Repayment Fund as partof the second economic stimulus package.Expenditure went up by
1/2%. If the excep-
tional burden in connection with BayernLB,which no longer had an impact, is removedfrom the calculation, expenditure would haverisen by as much as 3%. The increase wasdue, not least, to developments in staff costs,which are particularly important for stategovernment budgets, and other operatingexpenditure. However, seen in isolation, themeasures taken by central government in theprevious year to stabilise the economy also re-sulted in a knock-on increase in expenditureof around 1%.
13There are accounting delays between output and the
outflow of funds, but these are scarcely more than a few
weeks and should therefore have barely any impact.

74The state government budget plans, not all of
which have been finalised, forecast a markedincrease in the deficit for 2011 comparedwith the actual figure recorded for 2010.As the tax estimate from November 2010– which was €8
1/2billion more favourable
than the figure estimated in May 2010 – hasnot been taken into account completely, thetotal deficit should be considerably lowerthan the figure currently being forecast in thebudget plans. However, it is not yet possibleto foresee a significant improvement on the2010 result, even if the further pick-up ineconomic developments is taken into ac-count.
The high deficits need to be reduced quickly.
Carrying on invoking the exemption clausethat borrowing serves to avert a disruption ofthe macroeconomic equilibrium, within theframework of the previous borrowing limitswhich still apply in most federal states, wouldseem extremely dubious given the favourablemacroeconomic developments. Insofar asboth central and state government switch tothe new debt brake before 2020, it is essen-tial that the related deficit reduction path isappropriately defined and firmly anchored. Itshould be borne in mind that the long transi-tional period was intended to be a concessiononly for individual federal states with particu-larly large structural fiscal imbalances. In lightof this, some federal states that have re-formed their budgetary rules have even com-pletely done away with a further transitionalperiod or have at least limited it to a fewyears.
15A rapid return to sound budgets is
absolutely essential, particularly for thosefederal states confronted with high pension
claims.

Statutory pension insurance scheme
The statutory pension insurance scheme post-
ed a surplus of just over €11/2billion in 2010.
The financial result was thus significantly bet-ter than both the slight surplus recorded in2009 and the deficit of just over €3
1/2billion
forecast one year previously. This morefavourable development is almost solely dueto higher contribution receipts owing to posi-tive macroeconomic developments. Overall,revenue increased by just over 2% andexpenditure rose by 1
1/2%. The statutory
pension insurance scheme’s reserves weretopped up to €18
1/2billion or 1.1 of monthly
expenditure.
In 2010, contribution receipts were up by just
over 2% on the year. At almost 21/2%, the
increase in employees’ compulsory contribu-tions was somewhat sharper, with growthduring the course of the year accelerating tojust over 3% in the final quarter. By contrast,contributions for recipients of unemploymentbenefits were down by 5
1/2% on the year.

7521/2% overall. This was attributable, in par-
ticular, to the continuation of the generalcentral government grant in line with the per-ceptible wage rise in 2008.
Spending on pensions rose by just over 1
1/2%
in 2010. The growth rate of 3% in the firsthalf of the year, despite a relatively weakincrease in the number of pensions, stillreflects the high mid-2009 pension increase.By contrast, following the waiver of thepension adjustment of 1 July 2010, there wasonly a slight rise of less than
1/2%. The pen-
sion insurance scheme’s spending on healthinsurance contributions for pensioners evenfell slightly because the general contributionrate to the health insurance institutions wascut from 15.5% to 14.9% in mid-2009.
In 2011, the financial situation of the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme could deteri-orate somewhat. The contribution trend canbe expected to be even more positive thanone year previously. Furthermore, pensionexpenditure is likely to grow at a slower pacebecause the mid-2011 pension adjustmentwill be lower than the high mid-2009 in-crease (which also affected the first half of2010).
17However, all of this will be set
against revenue shortfalls of just over €2 bil-lion owing to central government’s consolida-tion package. In particular, central govern-ment will no longer transfer any contributionson behalf of recipients of unemploymentbenefit II. However, the knock-on effect of areduction in pension expenditure will not befelt until later. In addition, this is likely toresult in additional spending on pensions forpersons with a reduced earning capacity.
18Furthermore, higher expenditure on the basicallowance for elderly persons can be expect-ed in future. Nevertheless, overall, there willthus be a greater concentration of transferbenefits on persons in need.Finances of the

17Pensions were raised on 1 July 2009 – by 2.41 % in
western Germany and 3.38% in eastern Germany. The
discretionary suspension of the “Riester reform steps”,
which have a dampening effect on the pension increase,
was, of course, a contributory factor here. By contrast,
the “Riester reform steps” will result in the mid-2011
pension adjustment being just over 0.6 percentage point
lower. Furthermore, for the first time, those pension cuts
that were in principle deemed necessary according to the
formula but waived owing to the safeguard clause will be
clawed back by halving the calculated pension increase.
18Under current law, the number of years for which a
person has received unemployment benefit II reduces
their pension entitlement based on benefits. In future,
these years with particularly low contributions will no
longer reduce the underlying average earnings, as they
will only be taken into account as non-contributory
periods.Moderate rise

76Federal Employment Agency
The Federal Employment Agency recorded a
deficit of just over €8 billion in 2010. Justunder €3 billion of this could be offset bydrawing upon reserves. Central governmentassistance was required to cover the remain-ing just over €5 billion. On an exceptionalbasis, in 2010 this assistance took the form ofa non-repayable grant. Overall, there was amarked improvement in the Federal Employ-
ment Agency’s financial situation comparedwith the previous year’s deficit of almost €14billion. Nevertheless, the deficit was veryhigh, despite the unemployment rate reach-ing its lowest level since German reunifi-cation. The Federal Employment Agency’spension fund, which finances the pensions ofits civil servants, recorded a surplus of justunder €
1/2billion and its reserves amounted
to almost €4 billion at the end of 2010.19In
consolidated terms, the deficit was thereforesomewhat lower.
The Federal Employment Agency’s revenue
went up by 8% in 2010. The main reason forthis was not the regular contribution receipts,which nevertheless increased by 2
1/2%, but
revenue from insolvency benefit contribu-tions, which more than quadrupled after thecontribution rate was raised from 0.1% to0.41 %. Furthermore, both the rule-basedcentral government grant, which is linked tothe development of turnover tax receipts,and central government administration costreimbursements exceeded the previous year’sfigures, at times significantly.
By contrast, expenditure declined by almost
6%. In absolute terms, unemployment benefit(-4%), short-time working benefits (-20%),insolvency benefit payments (-54%) and ac-tive labour market policy measures (-7%, in-cluding refunds of social contributions forFinances of the

contributed to the decline in more or lessequal measure. Overall, this reflects the posi-tive economic developments.
In its budget plan, the Federal Employment
Agency expects a deficit of €5
1/2billion for
2011. Although the contribution rate to theFederal Employment Agency has been raisedfrom 2.8% to 3.0%, the contribution rate forinsolvency benefit payments, which is alsolinked to the wage sum, has been temporarilylowered from 0.41 % to 0%. In 2010, receiptsfrom insolvency benefit contributions ex-ceeded payments by just over €2 billion,thereby more than offsetting the €1 billion
shortfall from 2009.
20Overall, in light of
the current macroeconomic projections, theplanned deficit appears to be pessimistic, es-pecially since in its Annual Economic Reportthe Federal Government is now expectingmore favourable developments with regardto both wages and employment.
20Separate calculations are made for insolvency benefit
payments and contributions charged. The contribution
rate for a given year is to be set so that estimated rev-
enue covers forecast expenditure, taking into account
previous surpluses and deficits. An excess of €11/4billion
is thus calculated for the end of 2010, while expenditure
of just under €1 billion is estimated in the 2011 budget
plan.2011 deficit
