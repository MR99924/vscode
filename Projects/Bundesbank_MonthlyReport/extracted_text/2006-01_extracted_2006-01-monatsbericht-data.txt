IndustryIndustrial business activity remained buoyant
in November. This was mainly evidenced bypositive developments in demand. In season-ally adjusted terms, new orders showed a fur-ther sharp rise with the year-on-year increasegoing up to 13
1/C252%. Taking October and No-
vember together, seasonally adjusted incom-ing orders were 3
1/C252% up on their already
high level of the third quarter.
As for some time, orders received from
abroad were the main driving force. On atwo-month average, they were 5% up on thethird quarter, with large-scale orders for theconstruction of air transport equipment play-ing a main role. There was also growth in do-mestic demand, albeit at a slower pace thanin export business. In the first two months ofthe fourth quarter, domestic demand was2
1/C254% up on the summer. All in all, develop-
ments in industrial orders promise to gener-ate robust stimuli for overall output.
Industrial output did not immediately follow
the favourable demand in November andwas, in fact, somewhat weaker than itsstrong showing in October. There were cut-backs, in particular, in the production of con-sumer goods, while output in intermediateand capital goods held up. After adjustmentfor seasonal and working-day variations, theoverall fall in output was moderate, however,with the year-on-year increase going up to+5

6put was 11/C252% higher than the average for
the third quarter.
In line with the continuing sharp expansion in
foreign demand, a large part of productionwas again intended for export. Although ex-ports in November did not quite match theOctober figure in seasonally and working-day-adjusted terms, the two-month period ofOctober and November was almost 1% upon the monthly average of the third quarter.In November, imports, too, were clearly downon the month. Nevertheless in terms of value,imports were so high in October that thetrade surplus on an average of the twomonths was somewhat lower than in thethird quarter. However, around half of the in-crease in imports was due to higher prices.
ConstructionFollowing an increase in October, construc-
tion output slowed down again in Novemberafter adjustment for seasonal and working-day variations. However, average output inOctober and November still held up at thethird-quarter level, which confirms the im-pression of a trend towards stabilisation inconstruction output. In this two-monthperiod, the year-on-year fall narrowed toaround 1%, compared with as much as 2
1/C252%
in the third quarter.
However, in October, the most recent month
for which data are available, incoming con-struction orders declined again in seasonallyadjusted terms, and no longer showed ayear-on-year increase. Thus, business failed tocarry on the good performance of the previ-Economic conditions in Germany*

7ous months, which had partly been shaped
by a number of large orders. Only demandfor housing construction remained largelystable, whereas orders for industrial and pub-lic sector construction declined.
Economy as a wholeOverall, on the basis of the data available so
far and in seasonally and working-day-adjust-ed terms, real GDP growth in the fourth quar-ter of 2005 appears to have slowed downnoticeably again compared with the strongincrease in the third quarter. Although indus-trial output in October and November wasclearly up on the preceding months, exportsare likely to have been only slightly higherthan the positive figure already achieved inthe period from July to September. Net ex-ports’ mathematical contribution to growthwas dampened by the simultaneous increasein imports. In Germany, the pick-up in invest-ment in machinery and equipment seems tohave continued, whereas construction invest-ment probably held up at the level reached inthe third quarter. Judging by retail trade sales,private consumption still tended to be weak,however.
Labour marketAccording to the initial estimate of the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the seasonally adjustednumber of persons in work – which had beenrevised downwards for the period up tospring 2005 owing to a significant overesti-mation of developments in the case of low-paid part-time workers (mini-jobs) – wasnearly unchanged at 38.72 million in Novem-ber. This was roughly 191,000, or 0.5%,
lower than in the same period of 2004.According to data available at present, thereduction in employment subject to socialsecurity contributions was slowing down atthe end of the period under review. However,robust information is available only up to themiddle of 2005.
According to the figures of the Federal Em-
ployment Agency, there was a very sharp fallin registered unemployment in December. At4.64 million, the seasonally adjusted officialunemployment figure was 110,000 lowerthan in November. The unemployment ratefell from 11.4% to 11.2%. This noticeablefall owes something to the relatively smallnumber of redundancies in construction aswell as in weather-dependent outdoor occu-pations as a whole. Added to this is the factthat the Federal Employment Agency broughtforward the date for recording the figures,which may have altered the seasonal pattern.
PricesPrices on the international energy markets es-
sentially showed a sideways movement in De-cember. On a monthly average, spot quota-tions for a barrel of Brent North Sea oil, ataround US$57
1/C252, were only slightly higher
than in November. The prices of heating oiland petrol likewise changed only marginally.In December, heating oil cost nearly just asmuch as it had done in November. In Decem-ber, the wholesale price of petrol increasedsomewhat, following marked reductions inOctober and November. In the first few daysof January, however, spot prices rose marked-GDP

8ly again. By mid-month, crude oil cost around
US$64.
At the consumer level, seasonally adjusted
prices rose slightly in December, although theyear-on-year rate went down to 2.1% from2.3% in November. The Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) was likewise 2.1%up on the year.
On an annual average, the rate of price in-
crease in 2005 was 2.0% compared with1.6% in 2004. The more rapid pace of in-crease was due mainly to the sharp rise in en-ergy prices. The average annual rate of HICPinflation amounted to 1.9%, compared with1.7% in 2004.

General government indebtedness
According to the latest calculations, the con-
solidated debt of general government (cen-tral, state and local government plus socialsecurity funds) as defined in the MaastrichtTreaty reached 31.513 trillion at the end of
the third quarter of 2005. This means thatthe debt level rose by 362 billion in the first
nine months of the year.
Figures are already available for central gov-
ernment indebtedness in 2005 as a whole.These figures show that central governmentdebt increased by 335
1/C252billion.2Bunds ac-
counted for 3261/C252billion of this amount. The
first issue of a US dollar Bund with a nominalvalue of US$5 billion raised the equivalentof just under 34 billion. According to the
Federal Ministry of Finance, the issue wasfully hedged against currency risks. In netterms, Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) andfive-year Federal notes (Bobls) were stockedup by 38
1/C252billion and 351/C252billion respectively
while loans against borrowers’ notes were re-deemed in the amount of 310
1/C252billion. Cen-
tral government raised a further 341/C252billion
in the money market.
Taking into account central government’s as-
sumption of joint responsibility for the Ger-man Unity Fund’s debt on 1 January 2005,the share of Bunds in the total debt rose by1 percentage point to almost 58%. The rela-tive weight of Bobls (19%) remained roughlyunchanged. By contrast, the share of two-year Sch/C228tze rose by
1/C252percentage point to
just over 12% while that of loans against bor-rowers’ notes declined further (to less than2%). Thus, the trend towards securitised debtcontinued.
In 2005, the low level of interest rates pro-
duced significant advantages for central gov-ernment in the refinancing of maturing secur-ities. The greatest refinancing advantagesconcerned Bunds. While the average coupon

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly Monthly Re-
ports (February, May, August and November), by con-
trast, contain a detailed description of general govern-
ment budget trends during the preceding quarter. De-
tailed statistical data on public finances are published in
the Statistical Section of the Monthly Report.
2The increase in market debt recorded here may differ
from the net borrowing recorded in the budgetary ac-
counts owing mainly to the fact that the funds raised in a
calendar year can be attributed to a different fiscal year.
The 2005 budget plan envisaged net borrowing of 322
billion. According to the preliminary results, actual net
borrowing amounted to just over 331 billion.Consumer

9of matured securities weighted by volume
was roughly 6.9%, the average yield on newissues, including 30-year Bunds, was justunder 3.6%. Central government also madesignificant savings in refinancing Bobls. Herethe average issue yield (2.8%) was about2 percentage points below the weightedaverage of the coupons on the matured se-curities. The comparative refinancing gain ontwo-year Sch/C228tze was limited to roughly tenbasis points. At the short end, financing viaBubills in the tender allotments was slightlymore expensive than in the previous year.Overall, the annual interest costs probablydeclined by roughly 31
1/C252billion as a result of
the favourable refinancing conditions. Thisshould more than compensate for the add-itional burdens caused by the growth in debtlast year.
The Federal Government has not yet present-
ed a new draft budget for 2006. In the con-text of the coalition deal, however, there hasbeen talk of net borrowing of 341 billion. The
issuance plan presented by the German Fi-nance Agency foresees a gross issue volumeof3230 billion. With redemptions of 3195
billion, this means that new capital marketborrowing of 335 billion net is planned. As
last year, central government reserves the op-tion to issue inflation-linked Bunds and Bundsdenominated in foreign currencies. Given cur-rent market conditions, there is distinct po-tential for securing further savings in interestcosts when refinancing maturing securitiesthis year, too.Local government finances
According to the latest figures on local gov-
ernment finances from the Federal StatisticalOffice,
3the fiscal balance was developing
favourably at the end of the period underreview, continuing the trend in the first halfof the year. After a deficit of just over 3
1/C252bil-
lion a year earlier, a balanced result wasachieved in the third quarter of 2005. This de-velopment is due to the ongoing positivetrend in total revenue (+5%). In particular,net revenue from local business tax increasedsharply (+10
1/C252%) even if there was a slight
deceleration at the end of the period underreview. Furthermore, the 4

10grants from state government was more than
offset by grants received in connection withthe implementation of the Hartz IV reform.Total expenditure also rose significantly onthe year. At 3%, however, the increase wasstill well below that of revenue. The rise in ex-penditure was due largely to the increase inspending on social benefits (+12%), whichwas especially sharp in eastern Germany. Therise in local government spending of almost31 billion resulting from the assumption of
the costs of accommodation for recipients ofunemployment benefit II was, however, ac-companied by additional revenue from cen-tral government for its share in housing bene-fit payments ( 3
3/C254billion) and by payments
from state government, likewise as a conse-quence of the Hartz IV reform (just under3
1/C252billion).4Compensation of employees in-creased somewhat more sharply on the year
(at 2%) than it had done in the previous quar-ters. The decline in fixed capital formationslowed to 3
1/C252%.
In the first three quarters of 2005, taken to-
gether, total revenue was up by 31/C254% while
expenditure rose by 21/C254%. This results in a
cumulative deficit of almost 34 billion, which
is significantly lower than in the same periodof 2004 (almost 35 billion). Given the on-
going positive development of revenue ex-pected in the final quarter, a smaller deficitcan be expected for the year as a whole incomparison with 2004 (just under 34 billion).
However, the financial situation of many localgovernments remains strained. For example,the volume of cash advances continued togrow to just under 324 billion, or just over
one-fifth of the total debt. Cash advances aresupposed to be used only to bridge short-term liquidity constraints but are clearly beingused to a significant extent to finance currentexpenditure on a longer-term basis.
In a year-on-year comparison, the Hartz IV
reform did not provide significant net relieffor local government budgets (excluding citystates) in the first three quarters. While thecumulative expenditure on social assistancefor persons outside of institutions declined byalmost 35 billion, spending on accommoda-
tion and other benefits for recipients of un-employment benefit II amounted to 37

11received from central government for its
share in housing benefits, and payments fromstate government in connection with the im-plementation of the Hartz IV reform ( 33 bil-
lion in total), relief in the first nine months ofthe year vis-/C224-vis the same period in 2004amounted to almost 3
3/C254billion. Central and
state government agreed on an audit reviewdesigned to examine whether the total an-nual relief of 32
1/C252billion promised to local
government (including city states) has actual-ly been provided. This is not merely a simplecomparison with the situation in the previousyear. Instead, recipients of unemploymentbenefit II who are now receiving benefitowing to unfavourable labour market devel-opments or for other reasons (including thoserelated to the reform itself) and who wouldnot have been entitled to unemployment as-sistance under the former law are classified asformer recipients of social assistance. Calcu-lated in this way, the relief for local govern-ment is considerably higher at just over 36 bil-
lion for the year as a whole. This would havejustified central government abolishing itsshare in housing benefit payments. However,the Federal Government has now decided towaive this right for 2005 and 2006. Com-pared with the plans from mid-2005, this willprovide relief of just over 33
1/C252billion for local
government in the current year.
Securities markets
Bond marketIn November, domestic borrowers issued
bonds in Germany to a market value of 381.1billion, compared with 386.3 billion in Octo-
ber. After deducting redemptions and adjust-ing for changes in issuers’ holdings of theirown bonds, net sales, at 31.5 billion, were
slightly up on the month ( 30.7 billion). At the
same time, net sales of foreign bonds andnotes in the German market increased from35.2 billion in October to 311.1 billion. At
312.6 billion, total funds raised in the market
in November were noticeably higher than inOctober ( 35.9 billion).
In net terms, of the domestic issuers, the pub-
lic sector alone recorded inflows of newfunds ( 39.9 billion) in November, having cut
their capital market debt by 31.9 billion in
October owing to high redemption commit-ments. The Federal Government raised 36.3
billion net from sales of its own debt secur-ities following net redemptions in the amountof35.0 billion in October. On balance, it is-
sued mainly ten-year Bunds ( 35.1 billion) to-
gether with a limited number of five-yearfederal notes (Bobls, 31.1 billion), two-year
Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze, 30.6 billion)
and 30-year bonds ( 30.2 billion). By contrast,
there were net redemptions of Treasury dis-count papers (Bubills) and Federal savingsnotes ( 30.6 billion and 30.1 billion respective-
ly). State government borrowed somewhatmore on the bond market ( 33.9 billion net)
than in October ( 33.1 billion).
In contrast to the public sector, credit institu-
tions redeemed around 38.2 billion net worth
of debt securities in the period under reviewfollowing net sales of 31.1 billion in the
previous month. There was a marked declineof36.7 billion in other bank bonds outstand-

12ing, followed by outstanding debt securities
of specialised credit institutions ( 32.2 billion)
and mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 30.4 billion).
However, there were sales of public Pfand-briefe worth 31 billion net.
Domestic non-financial enterprises reduced
their borrowing in the bond market by 30.2
billion in November. On balance, they re-deemed only short-dated commercial paper(31.8 billion) and issued 31.7 billion net
worth of corporate bonds with maturities ofmore than one year.
In November, as in the previous month, do-
mestic debt securities were, on balance, pur-chased solely by foreign investors ( 39.6 bil-
lion), who, in net terms, bought only public-sector debt ( 312.4 billion). By contrast,domestic credit institutions and non-banks
reduced their holdings of domestic bonds by36.2 billion and 31.9 billion respectively. Non-
banks scaled back their investment mainly inpublic sector paper ( 34.9 billion); in addition,
they removed foreign debt securities andprivate-sector bonds from their portfolios(31.5 billion and 31.3 billion respectively).
Credit institutions, however, shifted their in-vestment from private sector paper (- 34.3 bil-
lion) to government paper ( 32.4 billion).
Furthermore, they invested 312.6 billion in
foreign bonds.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
picked up sharply in November. Overall, Ger-man enterprises placed new shares with amarket value of 34.9 billion, having issued
only 30.6 billion worth in October. The in-
crease is attributable mainly to equity injec-tions by a number of public limited com-panies. Against the backdrop of an exchangeof shares in connection with a large inter-national takeover, foreign shares were soldfor a net total of 323.4 billion, mainly to non-
banks ( 315.7 billion). On the other hand, for-
eign direct investors purchased Germanshares valued at 318.9 billion net, while for-
eign portfolio investors sold German sharesfor around 33 billion net.
Mutual fund sharesIn November, domestic mutual funds saw in-
flows of 32.4 billion, most of which accrued

Balance of payments
The German current account recorded – in
unadjusted terms – a surplus of 38.1 billion in
November, up 32.0 billion on the month. This
can be attributed mainly to a larger trade sur-plus. At the same time, there was a fall in thedeficit on invisible current transactions, whichcomprise services, income and current trans-fers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus in November went up by 31.1 billion on
the month to 313.3 billion. The seasonally ad-
justed surplus rose by 31
1/C254billion to 314 bil-
lion as imports of goods fell more sharplythan exports of goods. Imports of goodswere therefore 4% down on the month inseasonally adjusted terms, whereas exports ofgoods fell by only 1
1/C252%. In October and No-
vember as a whole, however, imports werestill only 1
3/C254% and exports 1% above the re-
spective level in the third quarter.Major items of the balance

14The deficit on invisible current transactions
amounted to 34.0 billion in November, down
30.3 billion on the month. The main reason
for this was that the deficit on services de-creased by 31.0 billion to 31.9 billion. The
deficit on current transfers, however, went upby30.5 billion to 32.8 billion. In addition, net
cross-border income fell by 30.2 billion to
30.7 billion.
Financial transactions in November were
greatly influenced by the completion of amajor corporate acquisition. In the area of dir-ect investment, there were net capital im-ports amounting to 319.4 billion. Foreign en-
terprises increased their investment in Ger-many by 320.2 billion net. The aforemen-
tioned acquisition of a participating interestaccounted for a significant proportion of this.German parent companies supplied their for-eign affiliates with funds worth 30.9 billion
net in November.
The transaction in the area of direct invest-
ment financed by an exchange of shares sim-ultaneously led to a countermovement inportfolio investment, which recorded net out-flows of funds amounting to 326.6 billion.
This can be put down mainly to the cross-border investment of German investors, whoadded foreign securities worth 333.4 billion
to their portfolios (compared with 37.1 billion
in the previous month). They focused on theacquisition of equities ( 321.0 billion) as well
as bonds issued by foreign borrowers ( 311.6
billion). Foreign investors purchased Germansecurities for 36.8 billion in the period under
review (compared with 39.5 billion in Octo-
ber). This was borne by the demand for Ger-man debt securities. There was again in-creased interest in public bonds in November(39.1 billion), whereas there was compara-
tively little demand for private-sector bonds(32.0 billion, compared with 311.0 billion in
October). As in the previous few months, for-eign investors sold a net amount of short-term interest-bearing paper ( 31.6 billion).
They also sold domestic public companyshares ( 33.0 billion).
Non-securitised credit transactions resulted in
net capital exports amounting to 33.3 billion
in November. Whereas enterprises and indi-viduals as well as general government trans-ferred net amounts of (mainly short-term)funds abroad ( 32.9 billion and 32.3 billion, re-
spectively), the transactions of the bankingsystem, which are essentially a reflection ofall other cross-border current and financialtransactions, led to outflows of fundsamounting to 38.5 billion net. Net capital im-
ports to the credit institutions ( 36.2 billion)
contrasted with outflows of 314.7 billion net
from the Bundesbank. The latter can be at-tributed almost exclusively to the increase inclaims within the large-value payment systemTARGET.

vember – at transaction values – by 31.1 bil-

of German direct
investmentMost of the eight new central and east
European EU member states have post-ed large current account deficits overthe past few years. This reflects thereal transfer of resources that istypically associated with the economiccatching-up process in these countries.Foreign direct investment plays a spe-cial role in this context. Not only doesit have a direct impact on the balanceof payments through the transfer ofcapital; in the long term, the ongoingoperations of subsidiaries also influ-ence foreign trade and profit distribu-tions and hence the current account ofthe host country. The increased inte-gration into the international divisionof labour arising from foreign directinvestment should generally promotethe sustainability of the foreign tradepositions of the new EU memberstates. However, the net effect on thebalance of trade depends strongly onthe motivation of foreign investorsand the sectors to which the subsidiar-ies belong. In this respect, it can beshown that it is, above all, foreign dir-ect investment in technology-intensivesectors which has a positive impact onthe balance sheet performance of therecipient country.

16up processes, they may also pose a major
obstacle to the future monetary integrationof the central and east European economiesinto the euro area, especially in the event ofimbalanced developments. Exchange rate ad-justments that might hamper the conver-gence process cannot be ruled out a priori ,
particularly if there are marked currentaccount imbalances.
1
Fundamentally, therefore, the sustainability ofthe external economic position of memberstates should be examined at each stage to-wards deeper monetary integration. For ex-ample, the Baltic economies, upon accessionto the European Exchange Rate Mechanism(ERM II), rightly undertook to make a substan-tial reduction in their current account deficits,even though participation in ERM II is not tiedto the same strict economic requirements asaccession to monetary union.
2
Following accession to monetary union, ex-change rate adjustments are, by definition,impossible. In order to prevent tensions with-in the single currency area and the resultantadjustments to the real economy, Article 121 (1)of the EC Treaty stipulates that the EuropeanCentral Bank and the European Commissionshall also take into account the status and de-velopment of current accounts when carryingout convergence assessments.Development and structure of the
current accounts in the central andeast European EU member states
The current accounts in the central and east
European economies of the Czech Republic,Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,Slovakia and Slovenia have shown significantfluctuations throughout the period since1994. While, at the start of this period, thecurrent account deficits were still generallymoderate or the current accounts were evenin surplus in some cases, the balances be-came increasingly negative in the mid-1990sas economic activity increased and trade rela-tions were intensified. The Russia crisis in1998 and the subsequent general economicdownturn brought about a temporary slightreduction in deficits. However, there was arenewed sharp rise in deficits at the start ofthe new millennium. According to estimates,the current account situation in the majorityof countries studied was only set to easeagain somewhat in 2005.
In the past two years, four out of the eight
new central and east European EU memberstates posted a deficit of over 6% of grossdomestic product (GDP). On an average ofthis period, the negative balances in relationto GDP were highest in the Baltic economies.While Lithuania has reduced its deficits con-siderably from just under 12% to below 9%over the past few years, Estonia and Latvia’sMonetary

Whether the existing current account bal-ances represent sustainable external positionscannot be determined solely by the size ofthe deficits. Instead, account also has to betaken of further indicators such as the com-position of capital inflows, the developmentof currency reserves, the stability of the finan-
cial sector, and existing foreign debt.
A more detailed examination of the counter-
parts of the current account in the centraland east European economies reveals amarked rise in foreign direct investment inthe mid-1990s. In Poland, this trend has evencontinued up to the present. In all the othercountries, however, the relative importanceof direct investment when compared withother capital inflows has decreased duringthe past few years. As a mirror image of this,loans from abroad, as at the start of thetransformation process, have again account-ed for an increasing share of the total inflowof funds. Portfolio investments have likewisebecome more important over the past fewyears and now constitute a major item in cap-ital movements, above all, in the larger econ-omies under study.
Viewed in isolation, unfavourable develop-
ments in the financing structure, such as thetrend decline in the importance of foreigndirect investment, might increase the risk ofshort-term and abrupt capital movements.However, this is offset by the fact that thebuild-up of reserve assets in the countriesconcerned is continuing at a rapid pace. Cap-ital inflows therefore remain greater than thefinancing requirements of the current ac-count. Taken by itself, this bolsters the sus-tainability of the current accounts.

19the potential for defending the exchange

The stability of the financial sector in the cen-
tral and east European EU member states hasgenerally improved over the past few years.

Alongside improved financial supervision, thisis also due to the large foreign holdings in thenational credit institutions. In some countries,the level of foreign shareholders amounts toalmost 100%. However, the sharp rise inlending recently could point to certain signsof overheating, which experience has shownto harbour risks when combined with largecurrent account deficits.
Foreign debt does not currently pose a serious
problem for most of the central and eastEuropean economies. It is only in Estonia,Hungary and Latvia that foreign debt is com-
paratively high and significantly above thethreshold of 60% of GDP which is often re-garded as critical.
5The ongoing development
in these countries therefore has to be moni-tored closely. Foreign debt is slightly above60% of GDP in Slovenia, too. Given a currentaccount that is almost in balance, this ap-pears to be less of a problem, however.Financial indicators of the central and east European member states in 2004

20Besides the external financing aspect, the
causes of current account developments arealso relevant for assessing the sustainability ofcurrent account balances. These causes arethe focus of the studies presented here,which aim to point out the risks that exist andto indicate the extent to which a reduction inthe prevailing current account deficits can beexpected in the new EU member states in themedium term.
The current account as a reflection of
an economy’s savings and investmentdecisions
The domestic counterparts to the current ac-
count form the starting point of the investiga-tions. To this end, the development of thecurrent account is interpreted as the result ofthe aggregated savings and investment deci-sions of an economy. By definition, the cur-rent account balance corresponds to the dif-ference between domestic saving and homeinvestment. The determinants of private sav-ing thus constitute key explanatory variablesof a country’s current account balance.
The “stage of development hypothesis” as-
sumes that the saving ratio is influenced bythe relative income level of a national econ-omy. The national per capita income in rela-tion to the per capita income of a givenbenchmark country indicates an economy’sstage of development. If consumption smooth-ing over time is assumed, households in econ-omies that are catching up will initially bor-row from abroad in the expectation thatincomes will rise. As the standard of livingconverges, the saving ratio is likely to rise ac-
cordingly, however, thus allowing a reductionin external debt over the longer term. Econo-metric analyses of the determinants of cur-rent account balances in the eight new cen-tral and east European EU member states doindeed show that the comparatively low percapita income of these countries has a nega-tive impact on their saving ratio. (See com-ments on page 21 for more details.)
The real exchange rate also represents a
major determinant of the current account.A previously anticipated real appreciation,through the associated gains in purchasingpower, has an impact on intertemporal con-sumption decisions similar to that of an in-crease in per capita income. By contrast, anunforeseen long-term appreciation is accom-panied by a positive wealth effect, which hasa negative impact on the saving ratio.
6
Owing to these opposing transmission chan-nels, the effect of the real exchange rate onthe current account can ultimately only becalculated empirically.
According to the results of the econometric
analyses presented here, the ongoing rise inthe real exchange rate has tended to increasethe current account deficits in the new EUmember states. This suggests that the exter-nal purchasing power gains associated with areal appreciation were only used for addition-al consumption once the gains actually oc-curred rather than being anticipated as com-
6The impact of the real exchange rate on saving and
consumption decisions considered here is independent of
potential changes in price competitiveness. See explana-

21Empirical studies on the determinants of current accounts in the
new EU member states of central and eastern Europe
As part of a panel analysis, major determinants of the cur-
rent account balances in the new EU member states of cen-tral and eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) wereexamined on the basis of quarterly data for the years 1994to 2004. The starting point for this was the followingregression equation for the current account balance orsavings-investment gap.
CAGDP
i;t¼/C130þ/C131RELGDP i;tþ/C132FINGDP i;tþ
/C133INV GDP i;tþ/C134REER i;tþ/C135RIR i;tþ
/C136M2GDP i;tþ"i;t
CAGDP denotes the ratio of the current account balance to
gross domestic product, while RELGDP is defined as a loga-rithm of relative per capita income in relation to Germany.The government budget balance (FINGDP) and investments(INVGDP) are measured as ratios to gross domestic productand are thus comparable between the countries. The loga-rithm of the real effective exchange rate (REER) rises in theevent of a currency appreciation and falls in the event of adepreciation. The real interest rate (RIR) and the moneystock in relation to gross domestic product (M2GDP) wereincluded in the study as financial market variables.
Positive signs are expected for /C13
1,/C132and/C135and a negative
sign for /C133. According to theoretical considerations, the re-
lationship between the real exchange rate and the currentaccount ( /C13
4)i s a priori just as indeterminate as the net
effect of a growing financial sector ( /C136). The absolute
values of /C132and/C133should lie between zero and one since
the associated variables, as components of the savings-investment decision, do have a direct influence on thecurrent account but can be at least partially offset by ad-justments to private saving. Panel unit root tests confirmthe stationarity of the variables.
1
Two estimation methods are compared. A feasible general-ised least squares estimate (FGLS) takes account of fixedcountry effects, panel-specific autoregressive terms, a het-eroscedastic error structure and a contemporary correl-ation between the countries. By contrast, an instrumentvariable estimator
2(IV) allows an explicit modelling of the
dynamics by means of a lagged endogenous variable. Inthis way, the Nickell bias, which arises in the static estimatewhen calculating the autoregressive terms, can be avoided.Furthermore, selecting the appropriate instruments meansthat any endogeneity, ie repercussions which the currentaccount has on the independent variables, is accommo-
dated in the model. These advantages of the dynamic esti-mator contrast with it being less efficient than the staticmodel. The table shows the results of the FGLS estimateand dynamic IV estimator.
The static and dynamic estimators produce comparable re-
sults, ie the results are quite robust with respect to the esti-mation method. All the variables display the expected sign.The current account deficits are largely due to the conver-gence process. This is suggested by the significance in theestimate of the low per capita income and investment. Thereal exchange rate has a negative impact on the current ac-count. The positive wealth effect of a real appreciation evi-dently depresses private savings. However, the develop-ment of the financial markets boosts net saving. With theexception of the money stock in the FGLS estimator andthe real exchange rate in the IV estimator, the parametersare significant. The Wald test confirms the significance ofthe variables overall and the “adjusted R
2” is 0.5.

at the start of the transformation process.7
Furthermore, the investment ratio is used toexplain the domestic saving ratio. A strongcorrelation between the two variables is ex-pected if, for instance, access to the inter-national capital markets is restricted. Otherreasons for a marked correlation and/or inves-tor’s preference for domestic markets are dis-cussed in the literature under the subject of“home bias”.
8
The empirical studies clearly show that, in theperiod under review, between 5 and 8 per-centage points of the current account deficitsof the new EU member states were due tothe economies’ dynamic investment activity.The real convergence process is thus likely tocontribute to the reduction of the current ac-count deficits through a longer-term slowingof capital accumulation as well.
The conditions in the financial markets and
the effectiveness of the financial sector alsoexert an influence on an economy’s invest-ment and saving. A significant incentive tosave is provided by the level of the real inter-est rate, which implies a positive correlationwith the current account balance. A com-monly used variable for the size and develop-ment of the financial sector is the ratio of themoney stock M2 to GDP .
9The thinking be-
hind this is that a sophisticated banking sys-tem offers increased investment options,thereby enhancing the attractiveness of sav-ing. On the other hand, it also makes con-sumer borrowing easier. The nature of the re-lationship between this variable and the sizeof the current account balance is therefore
a priori indeterminate.
According to the estimates performed in this
respect, the impact of financial market devel-opments on the size of the current accountbalances has been minor up to now. How-ever, an ongoing improvement in financialintermediation seems, on balance, to be hav-ing a positive effect on saving. The incentivesprovided by more efficient investment optionsevidently outweigh easier access to consumercredit.
Finally, fiscal policy should also be incorpor-
ated into the analysis as a further macroeco-nomic factor influencing the private savingratio. Within the scope of the intertemporalcurrent account approach,
10Ricardian equiva-
lence is assumed to apply, according to whichan increase in public borrowing is fully offsetby an adjustment of private saving so thathigh public sector deficits ultimately have noimpact on aggregate domestic saving.
However, the relevant empirical studies con-
tradict this assumption. Rather, they suggestthat the fiscal policy of the new EU memberstates has contributed to the – in some cases –

ciations, some of them sharp, of the central and east

23high current account deficits. The estimates
confirm what is known as the “twin deficithypothesis”, which states that governmentbudget deficits are a burden on an economy’scurrent account position. While this effect isnot particularly significant in the countriesunder review, that does not alter the natureof the relationship observed here. The expan-sionary stance of fiscal policy in some in-stances is not without risks. It can, for ex-ample, crowd out private investment in thecapital markets. Furthermore, in the case ofpublic expenditure, there is the risk of it notbeing amortised over the long term.
The values estimated for the new EU member
states in a panel analysis may be interpretedas a kind of benchmark, or as the “normal”level of the current account position that iscompatible with the current stage of develop-ment of the economies.
11The deviations re-
sulting from a comparison of these valueswith the actual current account balances en-able statements to be made, albeit with somequalifications, on the sustainability of theexisting current account deficits.
12It is appar-
ent that the size of these deviations has de-creased in almost all the countries during theperiod under review. This means that the sig-nificance of exogenous disruptions and ofother factors not included in the analysis hasevidently become less over time.
In most years during the reference period,
Hungary posted current account deficitswhich are larger than is consistent with the“degree of maturity” of the economy. Muchthe same applies to Estonia, where the re-siduals of the estimates have risen markedlyover the past three years. Deficits of this kind,
which are inconsistent with the state of thereal convergence process, point to a possibleneed for adjustment. This is all the more thecase as the current account deficits of thecited countries are among the highest in thenew EU member states. The picture looksbetter for Hungary, however, if the relation-ship between direct investment and foreigntrade is taken into account (see page 31).
On the whole, the results of the study sup-
port the assumption that developments inthe current accounts of the economies ofcentral and east Europe do not point primarilyto existing problems of competitiveness butare instead closely linked to the economiccatching-up process and buoyant investmentactivity. It may therefore be expected that anincreasing convergence of per capita incomesand a further expansion of the financial mar-kets will help to reduce the current accountdeficits.
Despite the progress towards convergence al-
ready achieved and increasing convergence inthe standards of living in the period under re-view, it has not been possible so far to ascer-tain any significant and steady reduction inthe current account deficits. This is likely tobe due, not least, to the ongoing appreci-ation of the real exchange rate, which like-wise reflects the economic catching-up pro-

Long-term effects of foreign direct
investment on the trade balances ofthe new EU member states
The major importance of investment with re-
gard to the size of the current account def-icits in the new EU member states could berelated to the particular role played by foreigndirect investment. Not only does foreign dir-ect investment affect the balance of pay-ments immediately at the time of the inflowof capital; in the long term, the subsidiaries’cross-border flows of trade and income alsohave a sustained impact on the current ac-counts of the host countries. The direction ofthe effect essentially depends on the purposeof foreign investment and the on-site avail-ability of necessary raw materials and semi-finished products.
Accordingly, in addition to the saving and in-
vestment decisions examined, the scale andstructure of accumulated capital inflows fromabroad are also important for the long-termoutlook of the current account in a givencountry’s economic catching-up process. Thecore issue here is whether the imports and ex-ports of the host country act as a comple-ment to or a substitute for stocks of foreigndirect investment. Transfers of income be-tween the parent and subsidiary are heavilydependent on other factors, such as theunderlying tax conditions and the economicsituation. The following studies are thereforeconfined to the relationship between foreigndirect investment and the balance of trade of
the new central and east European EU mem-ber states.
Since the start of the economic transform-
ation process in the early 1990s, the eightnew EU member states in central and easternEurope have been attracting a growingamount of foreign direct investment. Al-though foreign trade has also been increasingsteadily during this period, it has failed tomatch the mostly two-digit growth ratesposted by stocks of direct investment. To-wards the end of 2004, the level of foreigndirect investment in the region amounted totwo-thirds of annual exports and imports,compared with less than one-quarter tenyears earlier.
The increase in foreign trade over time and
the simultaneous build-up of foreign corpor-ate ownership do not in themselves permitany conclusions to be drawn about possiblecausal relationships between these factors.Theoretical considerations give reason to as-sume that the outsourcing of production pri-marily to reduce wage costs, or to exploitother locational advantages, has a positive ef-fect on the balance of trade of the host coun-try in the longer term. If, however, the motiveof the foreign parent company is to gain ac-cess to the market, the subsidiary often actspurely as a marketing company and henceprimarily stimulates imports from the countryof origin. Finally, horizontal direct investmentconsists in establishing parallel productionsites. Typically, these serve to cirvumventtrade barriers or to reduce transport costs.This kind of foreign investment therefore

25tends to act as a substitute for foreign trade.
There is therefore no clear relationship thatcan be derived a priori between direct invest-
ment and foreign trade, which means thatthis question can only be answered empirical-ly.
Initially, it is apparent that both exports and
imports behave in a manner which is comple-mentary to the stock of foreign direct invest-ment (see explanatory notes on pages 26-27).The positive impact of direct investmentstocks on the exports of the host countrywould suggest that the subsidiaries supplyintermediate goods or finished products tothe group’s parent company or that the for-eign subsidiaries are used as a platform forexports to third countries. Cross-sectoral rela-tionships between different enterprises andindustry sectors could also play a part andcould have a positive impact on the competi-tiveness of the location. Such spillover effectsarise, for instance, from transfers of technol-ogy or from the emergence of regions with aspecific economic profile.
Imports are likewise boosted by the presence
of foreign enterprises. This may be due to thesubsidiaries obtaining intermediate goodsfrom their home country or acting as salescompanies with a prime focus on the goodsproduced by the parent company being mar-keted abroad. Finally, it is possible that someof the foreign-based branches of multination-al companies are equipped with capital goodsfrom domestic production.
The overall impact of foreign direct invest-
ment on the trade balances of the eight newEU member states in central and eastern Eur-
ope cannot be determined clearly at themacro level in empirical terms either. General-ly, however, the presence of foreign enter-prises leads to greater integration of the hostcountries into the international division of la-bour, which is reflected in an increased ex-change of goods and services with othercountries. The long-term nature of these busi-ness relationships should a priori boost the
sustainability of existing current account def-icits.
These results are consistent with a number of
other empirical studies using macroeconomicdata, which, as a rule, have likewise been un-able to ascertain that direct investment hasany clear impact on the trade balances of the

26Deutsche BundesbankEmpirical studies of direct investment and the trade balance
The empirical study on the impact of direct investment on foreign
trade is based on a panel of the eight new central and east EuropeanEU member states. The observation period runs from 1994 to 2004. Ina first step, the relationships are analysed at the aggregated level.The regression equations for exports and imports are
EXP
i;t¼/C110þ/C111GDP i;tþ/C112REER i;tþ/C113FDI /C0INi;t/C01þ

/C124FDI /C0OUT i;t/C01þ/C17i;t
EXP and IMP denote real exports and imports of goods and services.
GDP stands for the real gross domestic product of the country underreview and serves as a measure of the size of the economy. The realeffective exchange rate (REER) indicates price competitiveness. Thereal effective exchange rate rises with an appreciation of the domes-tic currency and falls with a depreciation. The converse developmentapplies to price competitiveness. FDI_IN denotes the stocks of foreigndirect investment in the country under review while FDI_OUT standsfor that country’s direct investment abroad. Both are calculated atconstant exchange rates and prices.
1All variables are captured as
logarithms.
A positive sign is expected for /C111,/C121and/C122and a negative sign for /C112.
The signs for /C113,/C114,/C123and/C124area priori uncertain and can only be
determined empirically. Unit root tests indicate that the individualtime series are integrated from grade 1. An examination of the re-siduals as part of the two-stage Engle-Granger procedure producescompelling evidence for the existence of a cointegration relation-ship.
2Additionally, in order to take account of a possible endogene-
ity, the two regressions were estimated by means of a dynamic OLSprocedure (DOLS). Furthermore, fixed country and time effects wereincorporated and the variance-covariance matrix was adjusted usingWhite’s procedure in order to correct for distortions caused by hetero-scedasticity. The results are shown in the table on the page opposite.
Gross domestic product has a significantly positive impact on exports
and imports. Contrary to expectations, an appreciation of the real ex-change rate is associated not just with higher imports but also withhigher exports. This could be due to the fact that the economic catch-ing-up process tends to bring about a real appreciation of the domes-tic currency without impairing price competitiveness.
3Foreign direct
investment is basically a complement to the foreign trade of thesecentral and east European economies. With respect to direct invest-ment abroad by the new EU member states, however, this effect is sig-nificant only for exports, which is probably due, not least, to the smallscale of such investments.At the sectoral level, the examination of which is confined to the bi-
lateral relations between Germany (suffix D) and the new EU memberstates in central and eastern Europe (suffix i), a study is made initiallyon the impact of direct investment in the three sectors of manufac-turing (FDI_VG), agriculture and raw materials (FDI_PS) and services(FDI_DL) on trade in industrial goods. Instead of GDP, industrial out-put (IND) now serves as a measure of the importance of manufactur-ing, while price competitiveness is measured by the relative unitlabour costs in manufacturing (ULC).
The sectoral regressions are also estimated by means of a dynamic
OLS procedure (DOLS) incorporating fixed effects, with panel-correct-ed standard deviations allowing for the contemporaneous correl-ation, which is more prominent here. In order to correct for hetero-scedasticity, the observations were weighted sectorally according totheir variance. Serial correlation was taken into account by incorpor-ating autoregressive terms. The regression equations are

At the sectoral level, too, the size of the economies is crucially import-
ant for the size of trade flows. With increasing price competitiveness(declining relative unit labour costs), exports can be expanded, whileimports decline. Direct investment again shows a complementary re-lationship with foreign trade, with the exception of direct investmentin the services sector, which stimulates only imports – not exports – ofindustrial goods.
Finally, a distinction was made within manufacturing between tech-
nology-intensive and less technology-intensive sectors.
4The aim is to
identify the direct trade effects of direct investment in a given sector(FDI_SEC) separately from the indirect effects arising from direct in-vestment in the other hi-tech sectors (FDI_HIGH) and low-tech sectors(FDI_LOW). In line with the earlier estimates, the following regressionequations are used.

Trade in hi-tech sector goods is strongly influenced not only by direct
investment in the relevant sector but also by direct investment inother technology-intensive sectors. At the cross-sector level, however,

anced statements regarding the interplay ofdirect investment and foreign trade in thenew central and east European EU memberstates calls for an analysis of data with agreater degree of disaggregation. Such an ap-proach would be more likely to permit an as-sessment of the effects of structural changesduring the catching-up process as well as anevaluation of their impact on the currentaccount.

Owing to limited data availability, sectoralstudies are unable to include all foreign directinvestment in the countries under review andtheir external trade relations. However, theBundesbank’s direct investment microdata-base (MIDI), in conjunction with the foreigntrade statistics of the Federal Statistical Of-fice, does permit a detailed analysis of thesecountries’ bilateral relations with Germany.As German firms are playing a major role inthe establishment of subsidiaries in the eightcentral and east European EU member states,the analysis of German direct investmentshould allow significant conclusions to bedrawn concerning the general importance ofthe foreign presence in the region.
A further limitation to the sectoral studies
presented here is posed by the focus oncross-border trading of industrial goods.Trade in agricultural products and raw mater-ials is largely dependent on other factors,such as the availability of natural resources.And the exchange of services is subject to anumber of special factors which render acomparison with the rest of foreign trade un-productive and call for separate treatment.
15By far the largest amount of German directinvestment in the eight new EU memberstates in central and eastern Europe has beenin the manufacture of transport equipmentand in the chemicals industry.
16In 2003, the
most recent year for which relevant data arecurrently available, these two sectors ac-counted for 35 billion and just under 34 bil-
lion respectively in the group of countriesunder review, which is equivalent to one-thirdand one-quarter of German direct investmentstocks in manufacturing. The information andcommunications sector (ICT) has also showna steady growth in German subsidiariesabroad. However, the valued stock at the endof 2003 was less than half of the correspond-ing book value in the two leading sectors.
With a trading volume of some 320 billion
each, transport equipment and ICT goodsrank first with respect to trade flows, too,closely followed by machinery and equip-ment. Interestingly, the initial trade balancedeficits vis-/C224-vis Germany have fallen overtime in all of these sectors. In the ICT sectorand in the manufacture of transport equip-

problem which limits the informative value of empirical

30ment, the eight central and east European
countries have now even become net export-ers. In the chemicals industry, however, thetrade balance deficit vis-/C224-vis Germany hassteadily expanded. By contrast, in other sec-tors, namely the textile, wood and paper in-dustries, the countries under review havebeen posting trade surpluses ever since theystarted opening up to foreign trade.
Looking first of all at the impact of direct in-
vestment in manufacturing, agriculture andraw materials, and services on trade in indus-trial goods, it is apparent that the relation-ships with both the exports and imports ofthe host country are generally complemen-tary.
17It is only in the services sector that the
trade effects of foreign subsidiaries are con-fined to stimulating imports. This is probablydue to the fact that sales companies play adominant role in this sector. The relationshipbetween the trade balance and direct invest-ment within the manufacturing sector is inde-terminate, as it is when viewed as an aggre-gate, since both exports and imports arestrengthened. The same is also true of the in-direct impact of direct investment in agricul-ture and raw materials on trade in industrialgoods.
As has already been shown, however, the
manufacturing sector itself does not repre-sent a homogeneous group but comprises anumber of very different branches of industry.Activities range from the manufacture of tex-tiles, which is relatively undemanding from atechnological viewpoint, to highly complexproduction processes in information andcommunications technology. As the level oftechnology rises, the links between the vari-
ous sectors resulting from the shared use ofhuman capital, knowledge transfer and in-creasing product diversification generally alsogrow, so that greater cross-sectoral trade ef-fects may also be expected from direct invest-ment in hi-tech sectors.
The distinction made in the empirical studies
presented here between a group with hi-techsectors and a group of “low-tech” sectorsrepresents a compromise between the re-quirement for an adequate size and sufficienthomogeneity of the sectors, although theclassification of the various branches of in-dustry according to the input of technologyinto the production process is undoubtedlyopen to question when applied to individualenterprises. Broadly speaking, however, itseems reasonable to allocate the metal-working industry, the manufacture of ma-chinery and equipment, information andcommunications technology and the manu-facture of transport equipment to the groupwith more hi-tech production processes. Onthe other hand, the manufacture of foodproducts, beverages, tobacco, apparel andleather, wood and paper processing and thechemicals industry have been ranked as lesstechnology-intensive.
18
17While, for the reasons cited, only the manufacturing
sector is used for exports and imports, this model specifi-
cation also takes account of the agriculture and services
sectors in the case of direct investment in order to cap-
ture cross-sectoral relationships.
18The classification of sectors is generally similar to the
method used by the European Central Bank, although
this study makes a distinction between only two sectors,
ie a hi-tech sector and a low-tech sector. See European

31From the perspective of the host countries,
further direct trade-enhancing effects can benoted in the hi-tech sector arising from directinvestment within a single branch of industry.Positive spillover effects on the exports ofother industry sectors are an equally import-ant factor. Such effects may be explained bytechnology transfers or the accumulation ofhuman capital by pioneering companies,which makes the location attractive for othercompanies to export themselves. On theother hand, the imports of technology-intensive sectors are negatively influenced bydirect investment in other hi-tech branches.Here, too, agglomeration effects may be afactor if, for instance, the establishment ofsuppliers means that intermediate goodswhich used to be imported can be manufac-tured locally.
The close relationship between direct invest-
ment and foreign trade observed for themanufacturing sector as a whole and for thehi-tech sector in particular cannot be con-firmed for the cross-border trading of goodswith less technologically demanding produc-tion processes. The estimated parameters are,in the main, insignificant and do not revealany systematic impact on exports and im-ports. In the case of the central and eastEuropean countries examined, foreign tradewith Germany in these product areas is evi-dently determined largely by other factors.
Overall, German direct investment in the hi-
tech sector clearly has a positive impact onthe trade balances of the central and easternEuropean countries studied. This positive ef-fect is due, in particular, to indirect spillovereffects among the individual industry sectors
which boost exports while tending to reduceimports. By contrast, direct investment in lesstechnology-intensive sectors is of secondaryimportance for the development of the tradebalance.
The described relationships between direct in-
vestment and external trade in the new EUmember states clearly show that the presenceof foreign companies is a major factor forthe sustainability and long-term balancing ofexisting current account deficits. This is espe-cially true of those countries registering sig-nificant capital inflows in sectors with techno-logically demanding production processes.
A comparison of German direct investment
and bilateral trade balances confirms thateconomies in which technology-intensive sec-tors have a comparatively strong positionhave only low deficits in their trade in goodswith Germany or, in fact, post surpluses.These countries are the Czech Republic, Slo-vakia, Hungary and Slovenia. On the otherhand, in the Baltic economies, which havelarge trade balance deficits vis-/C224-vis Germany,direct investment in the hi-tech sector is ofalmost negligible importance. In this respect,they can hardly expect any positive impulsesfor reducing their trade balance deficits in thefuture either. Direct investment from othercountries is on a scale quite similar to that ofGerman foreign subsidiaries in terms of thetechnological intensity of the production pro-cesses. What has been said above thereforealso applies to the outlook for the overalltrade balances in the countries under review.

The current account deficits in the new EU
member states of central and eastern Europeare primarily due to factors associated withthe economic catching-up process. As realconvergence progresses, the external eco-nomic situation of most of these countriesshould gradually ease. Nevertheless, the risingexternal debt is not without risks. Problemscould occur, above all, if setbacks in the con-vergence process were to disappoint the re-turn expectations of foreign investors. Fur-
thermore, a real appreciation of the centraland east European currencies accompanyingthe economic catching-up process will ham-per a reduction in current account deficits byinfluencing saving and consumption deci-sions.
The Eurosystem requirement for a sufficient
degree of real convergence to be achievedprior to accession to European monetaryunion is therefore also justified given the ef-fects on the current account situation. Joiningthe euro area too early would make it difficultto set an adequate conversion rate. With im-perfect price flexibility, a misvaluation couldexpand the current account positions in Eur-ope and give rise to matching adjustmentcosts.As a percentage of national GDP

33The structure and scale of foreign direct in-
vestment are of special importance for thelonger-term outlook of external economic de-velopments. From the German perspective,the manufacture of transport equipment andthe chemicals industry, in particular, arestrongly represented in the new EU memberstates. Direct investment influences the bal-ance of payments not just in the year of thecapital transfer but also in the long term, be-cause the current business activity of the en-terprises concerned has an impact on inter-national trade relations. At both the aggre-
gated and sectoral levels, the empirical stud-ies confirm a complementary relationship be-tween foreign direct investment and the for-eign trade of the recipient country. In otherwords, both the exports and imports of thehost country are stimulated by the presenceof foreign enterprises. Above all, foreign in-vestment in technology-intensive sectorsmakes a valuable contribution to the sustain-ability of the host country’s foreign trade pos-ition.

35Securities market
regulation: inter-
national approachesThe organised interaction of buyers
and sellers in securities markets servesthree key purposes: price discovery,liquidity provision and the reductionof search and information costs. In aworld of perfect markets and perfectcompetition, there is no welfare-theoretical justification for interven-tion in market mechanisms – but thestory is altogether different if theseconditions are violated. Reasons tojustify such regulations include invest-or protection, enhancement of themarkets’ ability to function and thesafeguarding of systemic stability.
Central banks have an interest in secur-
ities market regulation issues parti-cularly because of their core task ofsafeguarding purchasing power andfinancial stability. In a “global village”,regulation is at once in a (financialcentre) competitive situation yet isincreasingly being conducted in aframework of international cooper-ation. Rulemaking in the EuropeanUnion is dedicated to the creation of asingle market for financial services.
This article discusses reasons for regu-
lation and describes the principles,forms and development trends ofsecurities market regulation. It alsoprovides an overview of key nationaland international players in securitiesregulation.

36Reasons for regulation
If securities markets perform their intended
functions (to reach an equilibrium, ie amarket-clearing price; to provide selling andbuying opportunities, ie liquidity; and toreduce transaction costs) efficiently, ie at thelowest possible costs, there is no (or at leastno exclusively welfare-theoretical) justificationfor public intervention. The conventionaljustification for regulation is therefore that,because exchanges on securities markets leadto external effects (for non-participating andtherefore non-considered third parties), thereis a public interest in protecting potentiallydisadvantaged parties for reasons of marketstructure (the number and size of sellers,economies of scale and network effects) andowing to information asymmetry. In this light,the regulation and supervision of securitiesmarkets is important for investor protection,the safeguarding and maintenance of a func-tioning competitive framework and the pre-vention of potential systemic risks.
Markets that adequately fulfil their functions
of price discovery and ensuring opportunitiesfor competitive trading promote – in competi-tion with financial institutions – the efficientallocation of capital. Consequently, economicresources are deployed appropriately and riskis assigned to those parties who are best ableto bear it. This represents the optimum utilisa-tion of an economy’s growth and employ-ment potential.
The markets’ role in price discovery is particu-
larly important for allocative efficiency: underoptimum conditions, a price that establishes anequilibrium between the supply of and
demand for financial assets reflects all theinformation relevant to its assessment. If allmarket players are price takers (ie do not haveany market power) and markets exist for allgoods or environmental conditions, decentral-ised management through relative prices isable to bring about the optimum coordinationof all activities. No other allocation of resourcesthat could improve the welfare of consumersor producers without being disadvantageousto one of the parties is conceivable.
Real markets, however, are not quite so per-
fect: in these markets, the obtaining andprocessing of information is not free, trans-actions consume resources and goods are ex-changed at non-equilibrium prices.
1The first
two aspects are particularly relevant to secur-ities markets. Financial markets – like financialinstitutions – exist precisely because informa-tion is incomplete and because the executionof transactions in these places is not cost-free. The economics of information, which iswidely applicable to the financial markets,therefore eases the rigorous assumptionsabout information requirements and marketperfection.
2It thus allows the consequences
of imperfect or even non-existent markets
1See T Gehrig (1993), Intermediation in Search Markets,
inJournal of Economics and Management Strategy ,
pp 97-120. Gehrig explains the coexistence of very differ-
ent price discovery mechanisms in real markets, in which
there are costs associated with finding trading partners.
He distinguishes between search markets where trading
partners come into direct contact (housing markets and
bazaars) and intermediated markets in which middlemen
organise price discovery.

37and of asymmetric information to be ad-
dressed. Hence, it provides an appropriateperspective as a relevant and viable yardstickfor setting rules for governing securitiesmarkets. Therefore, the main practical issueis to use regulation and supervision to createthe conditions under which securities marketscan effectively fulfil their intermediary role –with due consideration to the true character-istics of real markets.
The price discovery process is facilitated by
liquid markets. Liquidity represents the oppor-tunity of finding – at a reasonable cost – atrading partner at any time, ie to trade in largeamounts without biasing the price againstoneself (called “market impact”, ie a pricemarkdown owing to large orders requiringrapid execution). Liquid secondary markets en-able investors to divest themselves of their se-curities at low cost in the event of funds beingneeded unexpectedly. Liquid securities marketstherefore, at the same time, increase willing-ness to invest in such paper in the first place.Thus, the main objective of regulation effortsis to lend support to the structural frameworkthat can ensure deep, broad and robust – inshort, liquid – markets.
Liquid markets, however, do not guarantee
that the discovered price actually matches thefundamental value. A market may thus beable to balance supply and demand at verylow costs – therefore being technically or op-erationally efficient – without simultaneouslybeing able to ensure that the discovered priceaccurately reflects all of the economicallyrelevant factors.
3Such deviations between
technical/operational and fundamental effi-ciency are, at the same time, a sign of poten-
tially considerable mispricing which – in theevent of an abrupt return to more fundamen-tally justified valuations – can also causefinancial stability problems.
Information asymmetry between investors and
borrowers is a systemic feature of financialmarkets. However, this is associated withproblems relating to their proper functioning.The disclosure requirements which issuers,especially those in primary markets (see, forinstance, the Prospectus Directive adopted bythe EU), must meet, are intended to allowinvestors to form an opinion that would be un-feasible in the absence of such information.However, total transparency is not possible.Under certain circumstances, it would even befraught with difficulties. That much is obviousat the individual level. This is evidenced, forinstance, by the objections of secondary mar-ket players to the disclosure of consolidatedorder books. Were the latent demand of in-vestors to become known, this would under-mine intermediaries’ business models andcould, in macroeconomic terms, lead to re-duced liquidity, thus causing an increase inboth transaction costs and price dispersion.

Finally, the structure of a number of securitiesmarkets deviates from ideal competitive con-ditions.

38fewer and fewer vendors on the stock ex-
changes, they are becoming larger and larger.The barriers to entry are high (owing to highoverhead costs and the resultant economiesof scale). The same applies to the infrastruc-tures on which the securities markets arebased, such as the payment and settlementsystems used for providing securities services.These systems, too, are characterised byconsiderably degressive overhead costs. Inaddition, their attractiveness generally in-creases commensurately with the numberand volume of transactions conductedthrough them, ie network externalities exist.These, too, promote the concentration ofsecurities trading on a few markets and plat-forms. In the world of stock exchanges, sucha trend towards agglomeration has beenevident for some time. In most countries, thistrend has intensified to the detriment ofregional financial centres – particularly due toimprovements in information technology.This technology makes it possible to deal ininformation-sensitive financial assets morecost-efficiently, thereby leading to implicitstandardisation.
6
Consequently, the few remaining sellerscould exploit their market power to the detri-ment of buyers and, possibly, have less incen-tive for innovation and technological pro-gress.
7The positive effects of concentrating
market liquidity on a few platforms, however,include the more rapid execution of tradesand the improved possibility of buying or sell-ing major holdings of securities at largelystable prices. Focusing on one or only a veryfew networks, however, is not the only wayto exploit economies of scale. Alliances andcooperation agreements among diverse mar-
ketplace operators could create the above-mentioned positive externalities.
8Competi-
tion between the trading systems of severalmarketplaces also holds out the promise ofpotential advantages in the form of lowercosts, extended trading hours and greaterproduct variety. To that extent, another regu-latory aim could be to ensure robust variety,which ultimately serves to maintain competi-tion and to keep monopolistic structuresunder control.
An additional justification for securities regu-
lation is the limitation of systemic risks. Suchcrises can cause considerable damage to thereal economy. Regulatory intervention istherefore aimed at limiting the systemic riskson the markets. Effective securities marketregulation therefore promotes market integ-rity and enhances the stability of the financialsystem.
Principles of regulation
Regulation is obviously not an end in itself.
The regulatory framework therefore has to beassessed in terms of its effectiveness. It mustbe operationally efficient, ie fulfil the desired

39functions. The best reflection of the quality of
effective securities regulation is the extent towhich it ensures a functioning market mech-anism.
The benefits of regulation have to be com-
pared with the costs, as regulation ties upresources on the part of both the financialindustry and supervisors. It generates costswhich are ultimately passed on to the marketplayers. In addition, opportunity costs arecreated if market players’ preferences are meteither only partially or not at all, or if innov-ation is hampered. This is a danger thatgenerally exists in an overregulated environ-ment. Although, in practice, it is difficult tocarry out a cost-benefit analysis, it is an indis-pensable element of a sound regulatoryframework.
In addition, regulation ought to be competi-
tively neutral as a general rule. It shouldcreate equal competitive conditions for allmarket players without giving preferentialtreatment to or discriminating against anygiven player. Regulators should also avoidrules that set up barriers to entry or othercompetitive hurdles which hamper innovationor permit entrenched monopolistic revenue.
Finally, regulators have to carefully assess the
implications of securities market regulation,starting with national markets but also look-ing at cross-border activities. In a world ofinternationally integrated markets, these twodimensions are inseparably linked. Regulatorsand supervisors should be required not onlyto conduct a cost-benefit analysis – bothbefore and after a regulatory measure – butalso to meet stringent transparency stand-
ards. Such an approach can help to reveal un-necessary regulation and thus to introducederegulation measures.
Forms and development trends
of regulation
The regulatory framework for securities
markets is, in principle, based on two differ-ent forms. Under statutory regulation, thestate directly influences the market byprescribing rules for the market to follow andby conferring upon a supervisor, ie a govern-ment authority, the powers necessary tomonitor and enforce compliance with theserules. This contrasts with self-regulation, inwhich market players independently monitorcompliance with rules which they haveagreed among themselves and undertaken tofollow.
9This is often complemented by
framework conditions developed by agovernment supervisor. Self-regulation makesuse of market players’ expertise in financialmarket issues. It is thus also able to reactmore flexibly and quickly to market develop-ments. A stated justification for self-regulation is also that the “securities indus-try” has a vested interest in functioningmarkets and protecting its reputation. Self-regulation can also pre-empt or evenavoid statutory regulation. Moreover, self-developed standards can serve as a guidelinefor statutory regulations. One of the dangersof self-regulation, however, is that establishedmarket operators can seal off their markets,

40thereby setting up barriers to new entrants.
Even more, self-regulation (of service pro-viders) has also, at times, been exploited atthe customers’ expense.
10Securities regula-
tion in most countries is therefore based on acombination of the two forms of regulation,though the specifics vary from one country toanother.
The importance of self-regulatory bodies in
setting down the framework conditions forthe regulation of securities markets variesconsiderably in an international comparison.Whereas they are rather significant in theUnited States, they do not play any role in theUnited Kingdom and are hardly of any im-portance in Germany. In the EU, priority isgiven to the statutory approach to regulation.This is reflected especially in the implemen-tation of the 1999 Financial Services ActionPlan. In December 2005, the Commission,following a round of consultation, presentedthe basic elements of its financial servicespolicy for the next five years.
11The main fea-
ture of this strategy is that new statutoryregulation initiatives are envisaged for only afew areas (such as the retail markets). More-over, all new legislative projects must complywith the principles of “better regulation”,which attach major importance to, inter alia ,
the accountability of regulators.
Until the mid-1980s, efforts were made in
the European Community to achieve totalharmonisation of national capital marketlegislation, but failed owing to the resistanceof the member states. Total harmonisationwas unable to do sufficient justice to thespecial characteristics of national markets anddid not appear to be politically appropriate
for protecting the markets.
12As early as
1979, the European Court of Justice, in its“Cassis de Dijon” judgment, determined thatthe Treaty of Rome implicitly contains themutual recognition of national laws; totalharmonisation was therefore not a prerequis-ite for the establishment of the European In-ternal Market.
13This heralded a change in
outlook from the total harmonisation ap-proach to the principles of minimum harmon-isation and mutual recognition. The Commis-sion can set minimum standards for areas inwhich harmonisation is regarded as beingnecessary. At the same time, competition forcross-border financial products has beenfacilitated by the introduction of the “Euro-pean passport”. With this more casuistic andpragmatic approach, the European Commis-sion is seeking to create the conditions for
10Collusion to the detriment of investors can often
occur even in the absence of institutional conditions; one
example is the 1995 NASDAQ price-fixing scandal which,
in the end, led to a decimalisation of pricing (formerly
pricing in1/C258increments). See W Christie and P Schultz
(1995), Did Nasdaq Market Makers Implicitly Collude?, in
Journal of Economic Perspectives , Vol 9, pp 199-208.

5 December 2005.
12The European Community already made attempts to
harmonise national capital market regulation in the EU/
EC countries in the 1960s and 1970s. The 1957 Treaty of
Rome enshrined the dismantling of non-tariff trade
barriers and the promotion of the free trade of goods
and services (including financial services) between the
member states. The Treaty of Rome originally envisaged
the principle of “host-country regulation”. However, this
principle tended rather to entrench the continued exist-
ence of fragmented and inefficient financial markets, as
the individual EU countries often used the available legal
and supervisory scope to shield their home markets from
competition. See P Howells and K Bain (2004), loc cit ,
pp 378 ff.
13In addition, a Commission White Paper on Complet-
ing the Internal Market (the “Cockfield Report”) pub-
lished in 1985 proposed introducing the principle of
home-country regulation, which was enshrined a year
later in the Single European Act. See P Howells and K Bain

41the gradual realisation of a single internal
market for financial services in Europe (seealso page 46, “Financial Services ActionPlan”).
Regulatory policy is a key locational factor.
The globalisation of financial markets hasmade it possible for investors and capital-seeking companies to switch to lightly regu-lated or completely unregulated markets. Thisopt-out option has led to displacementcompetition between different regulatorysystems (known as “regulatory arbitrage”).If regulatory requirements involve high finan-cial and staff input for regulated parties,market players have a strong incentive toswitch to countries with less regulation andthus lower costs. On the same vein, potentialhost countries have an incentive to reducethe relative intensity of their regulations inorder to attract capital and business. Coun-tries’ efforts to outdo each other in reducingregulatory standards can trigger a downwardspiral, also known as a “race to the bottom”,at the end of which only minimum regulatorystandards, at best, can be enforced, makingmarket events increasingly opaque andrisky. These problems are, for instance, at theheart of the current international debate onhow to properly supervise the hedge fundindustry.
In contrast, it is also possible to imagine a
“race to the top”, in which the regulatorysystem with the highest standards wins theday. If the benefits of participation in themore heavily regulated market at least makeup for the costs involved, market players willaccept the stricter regime, for example, theTwo angles to regulation
There are two different approaches to
explaining government regulation.One explanation for regulation is asthe government’s aforementioned re-action to functional deficits. This nor-mative view contrasts with the positivetheory of regulation (“capture the-ory”), which ultimately sees the regula-tory framework as being the result of a“market for regulation”.
1This theory
indicates that it is difficult, in manycases, to pinpoint a public interest thatcan be protected by the regulatoryframework. It also draws attention tothe fact that the state is apparentlyalso quite capable of failure. Capturetheory imputes a direct interest on thepart of particularly affected marketplayers for regulation that is to theiradvantage (demand for regulation).The real architects of regulatory struc-tures are therefore identified as beingindividual players, especially financialmarket players, who call for regulatoryintervention – often as protectionagainst market access and additionalcompetition.
1Stigler’s work, in particular, has been seminal in this
field. See, for instance, G J Stigler (1971), The theory ofeconomic regulation, in Bell Journal of Economics and

42Sarbanes-Oxley rules.14When implementing
comprehensive regulations, countries withespecially large and attractive capital markets– in terms of both production and distribution– are at an advantage. They thus take thelead in setting standards. Financial marketplayers from other countries wanting to tapinto or keep their foothold in these marketsaccordingly have an incentive to subjectthemselves to these regulatory standards.A high standard of regulation can also be re-garded by investors as an advantageous signof quality. More weakly regulated marketscould then feel pressure to tighten their ownregulatory standards in order to maintain orregain their competitiveness.
National and international securities
regulation agents
The regulation of a market for trading se-
curities evolves as a result of the constantinteraction of industrial and market structuresand associated regulatory measures. To thatextent, the status quo of a financial system’ssecurities regulation framework also alwaysmirrors this financial system’s historical devel-opment and particular structural features.
15
The increasing integration of securitiesmarkets is not without consequences for theregulation of these markets and the organi-sation of such regulation. Internationallyactive financial service providers and issuersare confronted with numerous national rulesand regulations. National securities regula-tions should therefore be implemented in thelight of international developments andneeds.The elimination of barriers to the cross-border
exchange of financial services and the cre-ation of a “level playing field” for the produc-tion and distribution of financial products isimportant for the efficiency of the financialmarkets and thus, above all, for their users, ieinvestors and capital seekers. For EU coun-tries, securities regulation has been increas-ingly shifting to the European level. This hasresulted in ex ante coordination, which is ex-pedient owing to the ever-advancing integra-tion of European markets. European rules,however, could lead to implicit locational ef-fects for national markets. The safeguardingof the stability of the securities markets isthus no longer a task for national supervisorsalone.
The regulatory framework of the German fi-
nancial system and thus also of the securitiesmarkets in Germany is increasingly being de-fined at the European level. One such way isthrough regulations that enter into force dir-ectly and another is through directives thatmust be transposed into national law (seebelow regarding the regulatory process inEurope). The framework for German ex-changes, however, is still provided largelynationally. Owing to the historical fragmenta-tion of the German stock exchange land-

to listed US companies and their foreign subsidiaries but
also to foreign companies listed on a US stock exchange

43scape, the stock exchange and securities
supervision systems in Germany were highlydecentralised for a long time. This also appliesto the vast majority of other national stockexchange systems, however.
16Only since
1995 has securities supervision been conduct-ed at a Federal level. The regulatory andsupervisory tasks are currently performed in athree-pronged system by the Federal Govern-ment, the states and each stock exchange’sself-regulatory institutions.
At the Federal level, securities supervision is
the domain of the German Federal FinancialSupervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f/C252r
Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, or BaFin). BaFin
was created through the amalgamation ofthe Federal Banking Supervisory Office (Bun-
desaufsichtsamt f/C252r das Kreditwesen, or
BAKred), the Federal Supervisory Office forInsurance Enterprises (Bundesaufsichtsamt
f/C252r das Versicherungswesen, or BAV) and the
Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trad-ing(Bundesaufsichtsamt f/C252r den Wertpapier-
handel, or BAWe) in May 2002, and reports
to the Federal Ministry of Finance. As one ofthe predecessor agencies, BAWe was estab-lished by the Second Financial Market Promo-tion Act (Zweites Finanzmarktf/C246rderungs-
gesetz) of 1994 and given responsibility for
supervising German securities markets witheffect from 1 January 1995. This was the firsttime that the Federal Government had beengiven the power to supervise securities trad-ing.
17The legal and market supervision18of
stock exchanges,19and thus of trading on
stock exchanges, however, is still within theremit of the respective Federal states. Super-vision of exchanges is the responsibility ofeach respective state’s finance ministry or
ministry of economic affairs.
The exchanges’ self-regulatory bodies are an
additional element of German exchange andsecurities supervision. Each exchange issues aset of stock exchange rules and regulationswhich it presents to the state supervisor forapproval. Moreover, exchanges are requiredto set up “Trading Surveillance Offices” (Han-
dels/C252berwachungsstellen) , whose task is to
independently monitor the trading and settle-ment of trades at the exchange. If problemsoccur, they inform the stock exchange super-visory authority and the exchange manage-ment, of which they are independent. TheTrading Surveillance Offices are a hybrid ofstatutory regulation and self-regulation.
Financial market regulation in the United
Kingdom has changed profoundly in the pasttwo decades.
20By tradition, the system was
based strongly on self-regulation by ex-changes and organised market players (iereputation-based supervision). Although the

17By contrast, BAKred, which was created in 1962, was
solely responsible for supervising market entry and the
solvency of credit institutions and financial services insti-
tutions, and thus for ensuring the functional viability of
the German banking system.
18Legal supervision means monitoring compliance with
existing rules and regulations under stock exchange law.
Market supervision means checking to ensure that stock
exchange trading is being conducted properly in accord-
ance with the terms and conditions of business, estab-
lished trading practices and the stock exchange rules and
regulations.
19Cash exchanges include those in Berlin-Bremen,
D/C252sseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and
Stuttgart. In addition, the “Warenterminb/C246rse Hannover”
(Hanover Commodity Exchange), the European Energy
Exchange in Leipzig and the German derivatives
exchange EUREX are monitored.

44state provided a framework, it did not
constantly intervene. Regulators, however,always reserved the right to intervene at theirdiscretion. The increasing internationalisationof financial markets, the growing importanceof new financial products, communicationtechnology innovations, as well as severalfinancial scandals in the United Kingdom inthe mid-1980s all paved the way for the “bigbang”, which led to a much more rule-basedsecurities regulation framework in the UnitedKingdom.
21The Financial Services Act of
1986, which entered into force on 29 April1988, was intended to create a modern, morecompetitively-oriented regulatory system. Themain supervisory authority created by the Act,the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), en-trusted several self-regulatory organisations(SROs) with the task of supervising the re-spective markets. However, some of the indi-vidual SROs’ spheres of responsibility over-lapped and SROs competed with each otherfor members. Owing to apparent and serioussupervisory deficits, further profound changesin the United Kingdom’s securities regulationwere implemented in May 1997. The principleof self-regulation was jettisoned in favour ofstatutory regulation. To that end, the FinancialServices Authority (FSA) was created to suc-ceed the SIB with effect from 1 June 1998.Until the FSA completely assumed its regula-tory powers at the end of 2001, the existingorganisations continued to perform their pre-vious tasks. In parallel, the Bank of EnglandAct of 1998 transferred responsibility forsupervising the banking system and the inter-bank money market from the Bank of Eng-land to the FSA. The FSA completely assumedits regulatory powers through the FinancialServices and Markets Act (FSMA) in 2000. The
FSMA gave the FSA four regulatory objectives:the creation and maintenance of market con-fidence, public awareness, consumer protec-tion and combating financial crime. Since au-tumn 2004 the FSA has also been responsiblefor regulating the mortgage market and,since January 2005, for supervising general in-surance business. The FSA is thus evolvingmore and more into a cross-sector supervisor.It maintains an intensive dialogue with marketparticipants and involves them in the decision-making process through, for instance, con-sultation procedures.
The regulation of the US securities markets by
tradition stresses the principle of self-regulation. However, since the 1930s, iefollowing the banking and stock exchangecrisis, the government has also issued distinctframework regulations. The leitmotif ofsecurities regulation in the United States is toensure that an investor has all the informa-tion about the issuing company and the mar-kets that he needs to make an independentinvestment decision. Another feature that isdistinctive of the USA is the large number ofagencies involved in the regulation and super-vision of the securities markets.

45sion (CFTC) – are SROs which are responsible
for laying down the specific rules and regula-tions under which exchanges and marketplayers operate. They are also responsible forthe proper conduct of securities trading andfor sanctioning violations of the stock ex-change rules and regulations. Along with theregistered exchanges as SROs, the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers (NASD) alsoplays a key role. As a self-administrative body,the NASD supervises the NASDAQ
23electron-
ic exchange (to which it was closely linkeduntil 2000) and the over-the-counter (OTC)markets as well as the persons active in thesecurities industry. It defines standard tradingpractices and monitors brokers and dealers.
24
The task of the SEC, which is a federal super-visory agency (with a mandate from the USCongress), is to constantly monitor the func-tioning of this self-supervision and, if neces-
sary, to intervene in stock exchange activitiesfor regulatory purposes.
25The SROs are re-
sponsible for fleshing out the details of whatconstitutes permissible trading practices. Al-though the SEC has thereby delegated partof its control and steering functions, it still re-serves the right to supplement or amendexisting trading rules. If an SRO wants toamend any rules, these amendments have tobe submitted to the SEC for approval. Newsecurities have to be registered with the SECOverview of how regulation is organised

Congress passed the Maloney Act, which extended the
scope of monitoring to the previously unsupervised OTC
market. The NASD was established on the basis of this
Act.

46prior to issue and the SEC checks for compli-
ance with the formal rules regarding the in-formation to be disclosed. Securities traders(brokers and dealers) are also required toregister with the SEC before they are permit-ted to conduct securities transactions. As aCongressional commission, the SEC is also re-quired to report to Congress on a regularbasis and to apply for a renewal of its man-date. Additionally, each US state has its ownsecurities supervisory authority, which regu-lates intra-state securities trading and has itsown regulatory and sanctioning powers.However, the provisions of an individual stateapply only to securities trading within thatstate, not to trading between states. The fi-nancial and commodity futures markets andexchanges are regulated and supervised bythe Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC), which is a federal commission com-parable to the SEC; the SRO approach is pur-sued here as well.
Given the increasingly global nature of secur-
ities markets, regulatory authorities are in-creasingly cooperating at the level of inter-national organisations. The InternationalOrganization of Securities Commissions(IOSCO) is an international association ofnational securities regulators, SROs and ex-changes from all over the world. In Septem-ber 1998, IOSCO adopted and published the“Objectives and Principles of Securities Regu-lation”.
26These comprise 30 principles relat-
ing to three primary objectives of securitiesregulation and supervision: investor protec-tion; market fairness, efficiency and transpar-ency; and the limitation of systemic risk.These principles apply to rule-making super-visory authorities and – where nationally
applicable – to self-regulatory bodies. Theyrelate to the enforcement of rules (by super-visors), cooperation and the exchange ofinformation between supervisory authorities,the obligations of securities issuers, fund busi-ness, the requirements for market partici-pants and intermediaries, and the licensingand monitoring of exchanges and other trad-ing systems. These objectives and principlesstipulate, for instance, that rule-makingsupervisory authorities should be independ-ent of external political and economic influ-ences and should be individually accountable.They should also be given extensive powersof investigation and supervision.
As a voluntary association of national author-
ities, IOSCO can only issue recommendations;however, market discipline is quite capable ofgiving these recommendations the characterof regulations. In 2003, IOSCO thereforeadopted a comprehensive methodology for acriteria-based, graded assessment of thestatus of implementation of IOSCO principlesin the individual jurisdictions, which can alsoserve as a basis for the development of prac-tical action plans to remedy deficits. There aretwo main purposes behind the detailedspecification of the individual principles andthe setting of benchmarks: to make self-assessment easier for jurisdictions, and toserve as tools to be used by the World Bankand the IMF in their Financial Sector Assess-ment Programmes, with which they, forexample, assess the quality of supervisorystructures in individual countries.

47The comprehensive package of measures
contained in the Financial Services ActionPlan (FSAP) of 1999 is a reflection of the polit-ical will to press ahead with the creation of asingle internal market for financial serviceswithin the European Union.
27This action
plan, created to harmonise the legal frame-work, is a milestone in the process of Euro-pean integration and accordingly triggeredhigh expectations. With an agreement on thetransposition of the regulatory capital require-ments for banks and financial services pro-viders (“Basel II”) into European law havingbeen reached between the EU Council andthe Parliament in autumn 2005, the actionplan has now largely been completed.
The Lamfalussy procedure was introduced as
a procedural innovation for implementingselected legislative initiatives from the pastfew years. The intention was to remedy theshortcomings of the previous legislative pro-cess (the “co-decision procedure”
28), which
was regarded as too unwieldy, inflexible andimprecise for keeping up with current devel-opments in the securities sector.
29This pro-
cedure has been used to adopt securitiesregulation legislation since 2002.
A total of four legislative items of the action
plan have been processed using the Lam-Lamfalussy procedure
The “Committee of Wise Men”, chaired by
Alexandre Lamfalussy, presented its finalreport on the regulation of European se-curities markets on 15 February 2001. Its re-commendations included a reform of thelegislative process through the introduc-tion of a four-level procedure.
– At level 1, the member states (the Eco-
fin Council) and the European Parlia-ment make fundamental politicalframework decisions and define thescope of implementing powers.
– These framework laws are fleshed out
by implementing measures at level 2.The Commission works together withspecially convened committees – in ac-cordance with the comitology proce-dure developed by the Committee ofWise Men. For securities regulation,these are the Committee of EuropeanSecurities Regulators (CESR) and theEuropean Securities Committee (ESC),the latter comprising representatives ofnational governments. After consultingthe CESR, the Commission proposesmeasures on which the ESC then votes.The Commission, in turn, adopts themeasures.
– At level 3, the CESR develops common
guidelines and recommendations onthe national implementation of Euro-pean legislation. This is to ensure con-sistent interpretation and applicationof the rules through coordination andcooperation among national regula-tory authorities.
– At level 4, the Commission verifies the
accurate and timely transposition of EUlegislation into national law.

48falussy procedure since 2002.30Two of these
projects – the Markets in Financial Instru-ments Directive (MiFID) and the TransparencyDirective – are still pending implementingmeasures, which need to be adopted by theCommission upon a proposal by the Euro-pean Securities Committee (ESC) and follow-ing consultations with the Committee ofEuropean Securities Regulators (CESR). In thecase of the MiFID, CESR provided the Com-mission with numerous proposals for imple-menting measures in February and May2005; it did the same for the TransparencyDirective in June 2005. It is now up to theCommission to develop and adopt, in con-junction with the ESC, concrete legal acts(regulations or directives) in level 2 of theLamfalussy procedure. The Commission is notbound by CESR’s original proposals but willgenerally base its measures on these pro-posals. Although several comprehensiverounds of consultation – targeted primarily atmarket players, associations and the publicsector – were already held by securities super-visors prior to the finalisation of the CESRproposals, the Commission has decided toconduct additional rounds of consultationbefore adopting measures to implement theMiFID.
It is still too early for a final assessment of the
Lamfalussy procedure since only a very smallnumber of legislative projects have been com-pleted using this procedure. The checking ofimplementation at level 4, in particular, hasonly just begun. What is indisputable, how-ever, is that the Lamfalussy procedure hasstrengthened cooperation among the nation-al supervisory authorities and involves marketplayers in the legislative procedure through
intensive consultations. It is not possible toassess conclusively, however, the extent towhich the Lamfalussy procedure has madethe European securities legislation processfaster and more flexible. Initial experience hasshown, however, that the legislative processcan still be time-consuming even using theLamfalussy procedure. In November 2005,the Commission put forward a proposal for adirective
31moving the deadline for the trans-
position of the MiFID into national law fromApril 2006 to October 2006; the new rulesdo not even have to be applied until 1 May2007. This means that the MiFID will notcome into effect until at least three yearsafter the level 1 rules were passed – providedtransposition into national law is actually ac-complished within the (extended) deadline.
32
The complex nature of the material, as wellas controversy about the content of the rules,especially the specific shape of the transpar-ency requirements and the code of conduct,are factors behind the amended deadline. Inaddition, market players have indicated thatthe involvement of the regulatory committees
30In 2003 and 2004, the following level 1 measures
were adopted: the Market Abuse Directive (2003/6/EC)
of 28 January 2003; the Prospectus Directive (2003/71/
EC) of 4 November 2003; the Markets in Financial Instru-
ments Directive (MiFID) (2004/39/EC) of 21 April 2004,
and the Transparency Directive (2004/109/EC) of 15 De-
cember 2004. In March 2004, a directive extending the
Lamfalussy procedure to the fields of banking, insurance
and investment funds was adopted.
31Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament
and of the Council amending Directive 2004/39/EC on
markets in financial instruments, as regards certain dead-
lines (COM(2005) 253 final).
32Delays in the transposition into national law of EU dir-
ectives by member states has provoked criticism time and
again. For instance, the Prospectus Directive was trans-
posed into national law in only 5 of the 25 member states
by the 1 July 2005 deadline; Germany was one of these
5 countries.Lamfalussy

tion of the legislative process. Although the– at times – comprehensive consultationpapers give the institutions and associationsconcerned an opportunity to get involved,they also tie up considerable resources.
Conclusion
Securities markets make an important contri-
bution to the integration process and the mo-mentum of economic growth. There is a gen-eral consensus that securities markets needto be regulated as well as extensive agree-ment about the aims and principles of suchregulation. The regulatory framework mustbe adapted to both the market structure andmarket developments, and must be continu-ally refined. Flexible regulation enhancescompetitiveness and thus contributes to fi-nancial stability. In view of financial market
globalisation, it has for a long time alreadybeen impossible to regulate from a purelynational perspective. After all, the compe-tition between financial centres runs parallelto the competition between regulatory sys-tems. In order for locations to survive in thiscompetitive environment, the level of regula-tion and its degree of restrictiveness in thevarious economic areas will tend to converge.In this process, one element that will need tobe checked is whether regulatory goals canbe achieved more efficiently through self-regulation or statutory regulation. Anothermajor issue for discussion is the extent towhich the international coordination of regu-latory measures and bodies is better suited tomeeting challenges which are similar theworld over than if nations either act alone orrestructure their supervisory regimes.
