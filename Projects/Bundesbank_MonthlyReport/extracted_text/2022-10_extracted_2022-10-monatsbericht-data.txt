Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Persistent high inflation and uncertainty about 
energy supply and its costs are weighing heav -
ily on the German economy. According to sur -
veys by the ifo Institute, business sentiment de -
teriorated strongly in all sectors in September. 
The consumer climate index calculated by the 
market research institute GfK fell to a new re -
cord low. The economy is probably on the brink 
of a recession.1
Economic output may have remained more or 
less unchanged in the third quarter of 2022.2 
According to data available up to August, in -
dustry and construction increased their output 
somewhat. Furthermore, the elimination of 
most coronavirus protective measures probably 
still provided positive stimuli in some services 
sectors. By contrast, price- adjusted sales de -
clined somewhat in the retail sector. In add -
ition, economic output is likely to have fallen 
over the course of the quarter, as indicated by 
the ifo Institute’s surveys on the business situ -
ation of enterprises. There are mounting signs 
of a slowdown in construction as well.
Downward forces are likely to gain significant 
pace in the final quarter of 2022 and forthcom -
ing first quarter of 2023. In particular, the gas 
supply situation will be stretched in the coming 
months owing to the lack of Russian deliveries. 
From today’s perspective, it is fairly unlikely 
that gas will be rationed. High energy costs 
may have a similar effect, however, and lead to 
a decline in industrial production, in particular. 
This is consistent with pessimistic production 
plans and export expectations in this sector. 
Moreover, the considerable loss of purchasing 
power and households’ subdued mood for 
spending are likely to lead to a drop in private 
consumption and to spill over to consumer-  
related services. Economic output could fall sig -nificantly overall in the final quarter of 2022 
and first quarter of 2023. The extent of the de -
cline is extremely uncertain, however. Gas 
shortages, for example, would amplify down -
ward forces. These could be counteracted by 
the recently announced measures (depending 
on their design) taken by the Federal Govern -
ment to curb the high gas and electricity prices.
Industry
In August 2022, industrial output remained 
more or less the same as in the previous month 
in seasonally adjusted terms.3 Taking the aver -
age of July and August, it was up slightly by 
½% compared with the second quarter. Pro -
duction of capital goods rose steeply across 
sectors, with the manufacture of motor ve -
hicles and motor vehicle parts up particularly 
sharply. September is likely to have seen a sub -
stantial increase as well, as indicated by data 
from the German Association of the Automo -
tive Industry (VDA) on the number of passenger 
cars produced. By contrast, taking the average 
of July and August, production of consumer 
goods and intermediate goods fell markedly on 
the quarter. High energy costs weighed on in -
dustry. Production in energy- intensive sectors 
therefore fell sharply. In August, production in 
the chemicals industry and of coke and refined 
petroleum products was probably also damp -
ened by severely low water levels, which also 
affected the Rhine, and the associated restric -
tions on the transport of goods.4German econ -

After seasonal adjustment, industrial new 
orders in August 2022 saw a significant fall 
(-2½%) compared with the previous month, 
which had undergone a strong upward revi -
sion. A lack of large orders contributed to the 
decline. On an average of July and August, in -
coming orders were slightly higher than the 
previous quarter’s level (+½%). Broken down 
by region, orders from within and outside the 
euro area saw steep growth. This was offset by 
a sharp decline in domestic orders. Demand 
was lower for both consumer goods and inter -
mediate goods. By contrast, manufacturers of 
capital goods posted strong order growth 
which was attributable to orders for motor ve -
hicles and motor vehicle parts. New orders fell 
significantly compared with the peak levels in 
the summer of 2021 but were still above the 
pre- pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 
2019. Order book levels were also extremely 
high in August and are likely to continue to 
support industrial output.
After seasonal adjustment, nominal industrial 
sales were markedly higher in August 2022 
compared with the previous month (+1¼%). 
On an average of July and August, they even 
rose sharply compared with the previous quar -
ter (+3¼%). Foreign sales grew considerably 
more strongly than sales at home. Sales of cap -
ital goods rose sharply in line with develop -
ments in production, whereas sales of inter -
mediate goods were only slightly higher and 
sales of consumer goods declined somewhat. 
In August 2022, nominal goods exports saw a 
steep month- on- month rise in seasonally ad -
justed terms (+3¼%). Taking the average of 
July and August, they were well above the pre -
vious quarter (+2¼%). The increase came solely 
from higher sales prices, however; exports de -
clined in real terms (-1¾%). Exports to Russia 
increased in terms of value but this did not 
nearly make up for the earlier slump in deliver -
ies in connection with the war in Ukraine. 
Nominal imports of goods rose substantially on 
the month in August (+5¼%). By contrast, im -
ports from Russia declined, as they had done 
since April. Looking at July and August as an Industrial new

aggregate, imports of goods were up steeply 
on the quarter overall (+3¾%) but this was due 
to significantly higher import prices for energy. 
In price- adjusted terms, imports of goods were 
lower (-1%).
Construction
After adjustment for seasonal variations, out -
put in the construction sector decreased signifi -
cantly in August 2022 when compared with 
the previous month (-2%). On an average of 
July and August, however, it was somewhat 
above the second quarter (+¾%). This was due 
to a sharp increase in output in the finishing 
trades, where data are prone to revision. By 
contrast, output in the main construction sec -
tor fell markedly in both building construction 
and civil engineering. High construction prices, 
dampened household purchasing power and 
increased financing costs are squeezing de -
mand for construction services. Orders received 
in the main construction sector in July (the lat -
est month for which data are available) rose 
steeply on the previous quarter but they fell 
considerably short of the highs recorded in the 
final quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022. 
According to the ifo Institute, the reach of 
order books contracted slightly again in Sep -
tember. In addition, equipment utilisation in 
the main construction sector has been declin -
ing since March. There are thus mounting signs 
of a slowdown in construction overall.
Labour market
In seasonally adjusted terms, there was no fur -
ther rise in employment in August, with growth 
already tailing off in the previous months. The 
total number of persons in work dropped by 
4,000 on the month, although there were half 
a million more persons in employment than in 
August 2021. This is mainly due to the steep 
rise in employment subject to social security 
contributions which, however, also increased 
at a considerably slower pace recently. Short-  time work played only a minor role in July (data 
are available up until then). This was undoubt -
edly partly due to the fact that some special ar -
rangements for the use of economically in -
duced short- time work over the course of the 
pandemic had expired at the end of June 2022. 
The employment outlook remains slightly posi -
tive, despite gloomier expectations for eco -
nomic growth. Demand for labour is high in 
many sectors. There is therefore no reason to 
assume a significant deterioration in the labour 
market across the economy in the final quarter 
of 2022 and first quarter of 2023. However, the 
very tight situation, with many vacancies and 
low employment levels in enterprises, is likely 
to ease.
Registered unemployment increased only mar -
ginally in September, following a considerable 
rise in the previous three months, mainly owing 
to the inclusion of Ukrainian refugees. In sea -
sonally adjusted terms, the number of un -
employed persons went up by 13,000 to 2.51 
million. Rounding meant that the unemploy -
ment rate remained unchanged at 5.5%. The 
impact of Ukrainian refugees on unemploy -
ment was small in September as the inclusion 
of further refugees in the unemployment statis -
tics roughly balanced out persons no longer 
counted among the unemployed. Persons not 
being included in the statistics due to participa -
tion in integration and language courses played 
a role in this. This also explains the significant 
further increase in total underemployment, as 
persons taking part in active labour market pol -
icy measures and integration measures are 
counted in that figure. According to the Fed -
eral Employment Agency, registered unemploy -
ment went up minimally in September, even 
without the refugee effect.5 The IAB barometer 
shows a further rise in unemployment for the 
next few months, although the extent of this 
increase is likely to remain manageable.Construction

Prices
The price of Brent crude oil initially came under 
pressure owing to the flagging global economy 
and was down by 8% in September compared 
with the previous month. Following the recent 
decision by OPEC and its partners to cut their 
production target by 2 million barrels per day 
from November, the price rose at times. Most 
recently, it fell back to US$89 per barrel. Crude 
oil futures were trading at significant discounts. 
European gas prices dropped considerably in 
recent weeks. This was probably largely due to 
persistently high liquefied gas imports, price 
and weather- related savings and already well-  
stocked European gas storage facilities. Futures 
contracts suggest significant price rises again in 
the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter 
of 2023.
The exceptionally high price increases seen in 
the past few months at the upstream stages of 
the economy continued. This was mainly due 
to sustained price pressures in the European 
energy markets. In comparison to the previous 
year, import prices rose by around 33% overall 
and prices of domestic products by around 
46% in August. Domestic prices for electricity 
and gas tripled, for example. Even excluding 
energy, price growth remained in double- digit 
territory at both stages of the economy.
With the launch of the €9 ticket for local pub -
lic transport and the fuel rebate in June, high 
consumer price inflation weakened slightly for 
a time. Price growth already picked up pace 
again in July and August, however, even though 
both relief measures were still in place. After 
they had expired as of September, both public 
transport and fuel became significantly more 
expensive. This led to steep price increases for 
energy and services. Moreover, inflation in food 
and industrial goods gained momentum again. 
In September, the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP) rose by a total of 10.9% on 
the year, compared with 8.8% in the previous 
month.6 The last time double-  digit inflation 
was measured in Germany was in 1951. Infla -tion is likely to remain in the double digits over 
the next few months, even if several new relief 
measures come into effect, such as the reduc -
tion of the VAT rate on gas and district heating 
from October. Inflation will not necessarily be 
impacted by the government paying gas bills in 
December. This will depend on how govern -
ment subsidies are paid to households and thus 
on how they are reflected in the official price 
measurement.
Public finances7
Local government finances
Local governments (core budgets and off-  
budget entities) closed the second quarter of 
this year with a surplus. At €3½ billion, it was 
€½ billion higher than in the second quarter of 
2021. Revenue saw a steep rise of just under 
9% (+€6½ billion). At 15% (+€4 billion), growth 
in tax revenue was considerably stronger still. 
After deducting shares accruing to other gov -
ernment levels, receipts from local business tax 
– a large revenue item – increased by as much 
as 25%. Transfers from state government grew 
by 3½% (+€1 billion). Revenue from fees rose 
by 11%, and was thus somewhat above its pre-  
pandemic level. In part, this reflects the fact that 
pandemic- related restrictions on fee- charging 
public institutions had come to an end.
Total expenditure also grew robustly (+8%). 
One cost item, personnel expenditure, rose 
equally steeply. Once again, this was partly due 
to a special effect caused by a change in the 
booking of a civil servants’ pension fund in 
Baden-  Württemberg. Spending on social bene -
fits grew by 5%. Owing to the increase in the Crude oil price

7 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

number of refugees, spending on benefits for 
asylum seekers more than doubled (a rise of 
just over €½ billion), and integration assistance 
likewise rose sharply. However, accommoda -
tion costs for recipients of unemployment 
benefit II and expenditure on social assistance 
for those in need of long- term care both fell. 
This clearly reflected the favourable labour mar -
ket conditions and the expansion of long- term 
care insurance benefits. Other operating ex -
penditure saw a particularly large increase 
(+11%, or +€2 billion). Fixed asset formation 
grew by 6% as a result of rising construction 
investment (+7%). The growth seen in con -
struction investment and other operating ex -
penditure was probably due, not least, to the 
sharp rise in prices.
Following the significant improvement re -
corded in the first half of the year (+€4 billion 
compared with 2021), a surplus is again likely 
to be recorded for the year as a whole (balance 
for 2021 as a whole: €4½ billion). In the second 
half of the year, however, inflation will prob -
ably increasingly make itself felt. At the same 
time, tax revenue is likely to weaken given the 
gloomier macroeconomic setting. It is there -
fore to be expected that local business tax will 
lose its momentum. The deterioration in the 
business situation of municipal energy supply 
companies could also have a negative impact 
on the balance. In previous years, these com -
panies’ profits had still often offset deficits re -
corded by local government facilities such as 
local public transport operators.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €130.1 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in August 2022 was down on 
July’s  figure (€148.7 billion). After deducting 
the significantly lower redemptions and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €25.0 billion. The out -standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany fell by €7.3 billion in the reporting 
month, which meant that the outstanding vol -
ume of debt instruments in the German market 
rose by €17.7 billion overall.
During the reporting month, the public sector 
issued debt securities worth €20.3 billion net 
(following net redemptions of €17.0 billion in 
July). On balance, central government was the 
sole issuer of new securities (€23.5 billion), 
chiefly in the form of ten- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds: €6.1 billion) and two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze: €6.1 billion), as well as 
30- year Federal bonds (Bunds: €4.8 billion) and 
five- year Federal notes (Bobls: €4.5 billion). 
State and local governments redeemed their 
own bonds worth €3.3 billion on balance.
Domestic credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €2.5 billion net in August, 
following net redemptions of €7.0 billion in 
July. On balance, growth was seen primarily in Prospect of local

the outstanding volume of mortgage Pfand -
briefe (€3.2 billion), but also, to a lesser extent, 
in the outstanding volume of other bank debt 
securities (€0.6 billion). By contrast, public 
Pfandbriefe and debt securities issued by spe -
cialised credit institutions, which include, for 
example, public promotional banks, were re -
deemed in net terms (-€0.8 billion and -€0.4 
billion, respectively).
In August, domestic enterprises issued bonds 
with a net value of €2.2 billion, compared with 
€11.0 billion one month earlier. Other financial 
intermediaries were the chief issuers on bal -
ance.
Foreign investors, in particular, were major pur -
chasers of bonds in August, acquiring German 
debt securities in the amount of €18.3 billion 
net. Domestic non- banks expanded their bond 
portfolios by €10.3 billion in net terms, concen -
trating mainly on domestic paper. By contrast, 
domestic credit institutions and the Bundes -bank sold bonds worth €10.2 billion net and 
€0.7 billion net, respectively.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €0.1 billion in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market fell by €1.9 bil -
lion during the same period. On balance, do -
mestic non- banks were by far the main pur -
chasers of shares (€0.7 billion). Domestic credit 
institutions added €0.2 billion to their holdings, 
while foreign investors reduced their equity ex -
posure in Germany by €2.6 billion on balance.
Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€6.9 billion in August, compared with €2.8 bil -
lion in July. On balance, specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the sole 
beneficiaries (€7.2 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, new shares were placed on the 
market primarily by mixed securities funds 
(€4.4 billion), as well as equity funds and open- 
end real estate funds (€1.7 billion and €1.5 bil -
lion, respectively). The outstanding volume of 
foreign mutual fund shares distributed in Ger -
many increased by €0.4 billion during the 
month under review. On balance, solely do -
mestic non- banks purchased mutual fund 
shares in August (€7.9 billion). The bulk of 
these were domestic mutual fund shares. Do -
mestic credit institutions reduced their fund 
portfolios by €0.5 billion, while foreign invest -
ors were only marginally active in the German 
market. 
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of only €0.6 billion in August 2022, down €4.8

plus. The deficit on invisible current transac -
tions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income, changed only 
slightly.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account contracted by €5.0 billion to 
€3.5 billion because receipts fell and expend -
iture rose sharply.
The deficit on invisible current transactions de -
clined slightly by €0.2 billion to €2.9 billion in 
August. The increases in the balances of pri -
mary and secondary income were almost offset 
by the expansion of the services account deficit 
by €1.6 billion to €8.8 billion. Services receipts 
were down overall, mainly due to lower re -
ceipts from charges for the use of intellectual 
property and other business services. In add -
ition, expenditure rose, largely owing to higher 
expenditure on transport services and – as is 
typical for this time of year – on travel. By con -
trast, net receipts on primary income went up 
by €0.9 billion to €11.6 billion. Total receipts re -
mained virtually unchanged, also because 
lower receipts from direct investment and 
higher receipts from portfolio investment 
broadly balanced each other out. Expenditure 
fell, however, with declining dividend payments 
to non- residents from portfolio investment 
contributing to this decrease. Moreover, the 
deficit on secondary income narrowed by €0.9 
billion to €5.6 billion, chiefly linked to lower 
general government expenditure on current 
transfers relating to international cooperation.
In August 2022, the financial markets con -
tinued to be shaped by the environment of 
high inflation rates, with the economic outlook 
deteriorating at the same time. Germany’s 
cross- border portfolio investment generated 
net capital imports of €24.9 billion (July: net 
capital exports of €5.4 billion). Foreign invest -
ors added German securities worth €15.6 bil -
lion net to their portfolios, purchasing bonds 
(€22.9 billion) whilst offloading money market 
paper (€4.6 billion) and shares (€2.6 billion). By

Direct investment recorded net capital exports 
of €12.7 billion in August (July: €14.1 billion). 
The main reason for this was that domestic

abroad with additional funds worth €43.7 bil -
lion via intra- group lending. In addition, they 
boosted their equity capital by €8.8 billion, pri -
marily through reinvested earnings. Conversely, 
foreign enterprises increased their investment 
in Germany by €39.8 billion, issuing intra- group 
loans to the tune of €39.6 billion and raising 
their equity capital by €0.2 billion.Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these

capital exports amounting to €41.1 billion in 
August (following net capital imports of €34.9 
billion in July). The Bundesbank’s net external 
claims went up by €47.2 billion. This rise was 
chiefly attributable to the increase in TARGET2

ever, the Bundesbank’s external liabilities also 
grew, mainly driven by a rise in deposits of 
non- euro area residents at the Bundesbank.

State government finances in 2021: 
surplus  and additional reserves from 
emergency  borrowing
The budgets of the state governments and their local governments shaped up very well in the 
second year of the coronavirus pandemic. Altogether, they recorded a surplus of €5 billion in 
2021 following a deficit of €32 billion in 2020. This favourable outcome was due not only to a 
sharp rise in tax revenue but also to the fact that the Federal Government assumed the bulk of 
pandemic- related burdens. In structural terms, the surplus was considerably higher still, as the 
structural balance excludes the unfavourable effects of the cyclical component, financial transac -
tions and temporary coronavirus- related burdens.
More specifically, half of the federal states (including their off- budget entities and municipalities) 
reported a surplus in 2021. Rhineland- Palatinate, home to the main site of a vaccine manufac -
turer, came off particularly well. In structural terms, all state government budgets were at the very 
least balanced – even without temporary coronavirus- related burdens being factored out.
Within the framework of their respective debt brakes, state governments made use of emergency 
borrowing totalling €18 billion, despite the good state of their finances. Special calculations indi -
cate that they needed only a small portion of this to close funding gaps in their core budgets and 
off- budget entities. They thus used most of this borrowing to top up reserves with which they can 
finance future budgets. These reserves may be part of the core budget or resources placed in spe -
cial funds. Rhineland- Palatinate was the only federal state to have already repaid all the emer -
gency loans it took out in 2020.
Going by budget documents and surveys, state governments held reserves of over €110 billion as 
at the end of 2021. These also include pension pots of almost €50 billion. Several federal states 
are planning to use reserves to close gaps in their budgets for some years to come. However, 
where the reserves to be used for this purpose have effectively been formed from emergency bor -
rowing in connection with the pandemic, such an approach seems questionable.
As things stand, a large surplus is on the cards for the federal states this year, and most of them 
have sizeable reserves available should budget developments take a turn for the worse. There -
fore, despite the difficult environment in which they are currently operating, further take- up of 
emergency loans at the state government level this year does not appear self- evident. Their very 
good starting position should enable the state governments to make a considerable contribution 
to the financial challenges. In any event, central government will assume the lion’s share of 
expenditure stemming from the current energy crisis.
Individual federal states’ finances still lack transparency. The opportunities offered by competition 
between the federal states risk remaining unused as long as data are difficult to compare. The 
diversity of rules in state- specific debt brakes also makes it harder to compare the structural fiscal 
positions of the federal states. In addition, important budgetary data are published with a major 
time lag in some cases. The Stability Council, in particular, remains tasked with making substan -
tial progress with respect to transparency, comparability and timely publication.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overview
State and local governments recorded a per -
ceptible surplus in 2021. This was possible due 
to taxes growing sharply and central govern -
ment assuming a fairly large proportion of 
pandemic- related burdens. Nevertheless, most 
federal states once again activated their debt 
brake escape clauses. Significant rises in sur -
pluses have so far still been on the horizon for 
the current year.
This report builds on the corresponding ana -
lyses of the annual figures for state government 
finances in recent years. Government finance 
statistics are specially processed (see the box on 
pp. 15f.) and cover the federal states and their 
municipalities. Particular focus is placed on key 
variables such as balance, debt and interest 
burden. The report presents the results for both 
the federal states as a whole and for individual 
federal states. A later section takes a closer 
look at the accounting for the state- specific debt brakes for 2021. This examines which fed -
eral states (non- city states excluding their muni -
cipalities) took out emergency loans and com -
pares the extent to which the budgetary data 
indicate a need for this. The concluding re -
marks contextualise the results and point to 
shortcomings in the transparency and compar -
ability of state government finances.

of state and local 
governments  in 2021
Federal states as a whole: 
 surplus despite temporary 
 burdens
In 2021, state governments (including off-  
budget entities and local governments) re -
corded an unadjusted surplus of €5 billion (just 
over 0.1% of gross domestic product; see the 
adjacent table, item 1, and the chart on p. 16). 
State government core budgets, meanwhile, 
posted a deficit of €6 billion. On balance, they 
used the bulk of this deficit to finance the sur -
plus of €6½ billion in their off- budget entities.1 
Local governments (core budgets and off-  
budget entities) contributed a surplus of €4½ 
billion.
From a structural perspective, the surplus of 
state and local governments was significantly 
higher still, reaching €32 billion (see the adja -
cent table, items 2-8). To calculate the struc -
tural figure, the unadjusted balance is adjusted 
for various items that obscure the underlying 
financial situation. The following are deducted:
– burdens in the amount of €9 billion stem -
ming from the unfavourable cyclical com -
ponent (Bundesbank estimate);
– financial transactions of €8½ billion;Surpluses in

Preparation of state government data and data gaps
The Bundesbank prepares the cash statistics 
for the purpose of presenting results for 
both the federal states as a whole and for 
individual state governments. The data pre-
pared in this way form the basis for the an-
alysis in the fi  rst part of the report and can 
be found in the tables on pp. 30-33:1
– The picture of the federal states’ fi  scal 
situation is supposed to be complete and 
comparable. Their off- budget entities and 
the local government level are therefore 
also included in addition to their core 
budgets. It then no longer matters for the 
results which of the entities assumes a 
given task and bears any resulting def-
icits. Furthermore, this makes non- city 
states and city states more easily compar-
able, as the latter include the local gov-
ernment level.
– Shifts in fi  nancial assets and temporary 
effects should not distort the underlying 
picture. For this reason, four adjustments 
are necessary. The fi  rst two of these four 
steps are implemented in a similar way by 
both central government and many state 
governments in their debt brakes.
– First, fi  nancial transactions (shifts in 
fi  nancial assets such as loans granted) 
are disregarded.
– Second, cyclical effects are deducted 
from the fi  scal balance. In this report, 
the Bundesbank uses its own method 
to calculate the cyclical effects on the 
basis of its spring projection.
– Third, the provisional settlement fi  gures 
for the fi  nancial equalisation scheme 
and the supplementary central govern-ment transfers are additionally taken 
into account on an accruals basis.
– Fourth, larger one- off effects are also 
generally factored out. That being said, 
none were recorded in the reporting 
year aside from the coronavirus bur-
dens that were not reimbursed by cen-
tral government. In individual federal 
states, however, there were gaps in the 
data on coronavirus burdens. Compari-
sons among federal states are therefore 
made on the basis of results that have 
not been adjusted for these burdens 
(partially adjusted structural balances).
Remaining weaknesses in the data pool
Despite the preparation of the data out-
lined above, the results and the underlying 
fi  scal policy can, in some cases, only be in-
terpreted to a limited extent.
– One problematic factor is that some state 
governments record data in a way that 
deviates from the intended methodology. 
This applies, for example, to coronavirus- 
related business aid from central govern-
ment; in some state governments, this 
was recorded as other operating expend-
iture rather than as business transfers. 
This means that expenditure categories 
are no longer comparable between state 
governments. Although coronavirus- 
related business aid from central govern-
ment was intended to be channelled 
through the state government budgets, it 
also partly affected the balance. This was 
the case where state governments had 
received the central government funds

– temporary burdens of around €9 billion aris -
ing from measures taken in response to the 
coronavirus pandemic2 (Bundesbank esti -
mate based on draft legislation and surveys). 
In particular, these include spending on coronavirus tests in schools and vaccination 
centre costs.
The excellent outturn and the notable improve -
ment on the year were driven largely by strong 
tax revenue, which rose considerably and was 
markedly higher than the figure expected by 
the Working Party on Tax Revenue Estimates 
before the pandemic (in October 2019) for 
2021.
However, it is highly uncertain to what extent 
the highly favourable structural developments 
are in fact so favourable, as it became more dif -
ficult to distinguish temporary factors from 
structural ones in the coronavirus years. For ex -
ample, it was only possible to estimate cyclical 
factors with a considerably higher degree of Dynamic tax 
developments
Structural sur -
plus potentially 
overstated by 
payment shiftsbut had not yet disbursed them. As in 
previous years, capital transfers used to 
absorb losses do not always appear to 
have been correctly separated from ac-
quisitions of participating interests. The 
latter only change the type of fi  nancial 
assets recorded, not the amount. In this 
analysis, however, the adjustment for 
fi  nancial transactions is carried out in line 
with budgetary reporting (as is the case 
for most debt brakes).
– The volume of public spending is unclear 
in some places. This is due, in particular, 
to transfer balances within the general 
government sector, which arise in cases 
where the bookings of the receiving and 
paying entities do not match. According 
to the cash statistics, state government 
off- budget entities received current trans-
fers of €43 billion from the state govern-
ment core budgets last year, whereas the core budgets only paid out €21 billion. 
For the consolidated result of core 
budgets and off- budget entities, the cash 
statistics also included core budget pay-
ments to off- budget entities from other 
items. On balance, these exceeded the 
revenue of the off- budget entities by €2 
billion, meaning that it is not possible to 
adjust them. Where internal payments 
are service charges, the cash statistics do 
not consolidate these at all. Service costs 
are then double- counted. The distortion 
increases when services for government 
entities are outsourced from the core 
budget to off- budget entities.

uncertainty more recently.3 Moreover, struc -
tural tax revenue in 2021 may be overstated by 
the fact that tax payments for which there had 
been a deferral in 2020 due to the pandemic 
were made in the meantime. Last but not least, 
it is impossible to fully gauge the financial ram -
ifications of the coronavirus pandemic that 
went beyond recorded measures, e.g. non-  
payment of fees due to the pandemic- related 
closure of various facilities.
Comparing individual federal 
states
Balances vary considerably from state 
to state
This article also presents the results and ad -
justed balances for each federal state. How -
ever, it was not possible to factor out tempor -
ary coronavirus response measures, as some 
federal states did not fully quantify these bur -
dens on request (temporary coronavirus- related 
burdens of €110 per capita were deducted for 
the federal states as a whole). As a result, the 
structural balances reported for individual fed -
eral states still include the burdens arising from 
coronavirus response measures, i.e. their actual 
structural figures are more favourable than 
shown here. The state government balances 
can therefore only be labelled as partially ad -
justed. Nevertheless, they are much more in -
formative than the unadjusted balances, as 
they exclude cyclical factors, delays in financial 
equalisation and financial transactions, some of 
which are sizeable. Detailed state- by- state re -
sults can be found in the table on pp. 30 f. To 
improve comparability between the federal 
states, figures are given below relative to the 
population size of each federal state.
In unadjusted terms, half of the federal states 
(including their municipalities) closed 2021 with 
a surplus. Rhineland- Palatinate recorded the 
highest surplus, at €710 per capita. The largest 
deficit (€570 per capita) was posted by Berlin.The partly adjusted balances of the federal 
states still varied considerably in 2021, but to a 
lesser extent. Looking at the federal states as a 
whole, the partially adjusted surplus amounted 
to €270 per capita. At €600, Rhineland-  
Palatinate again recorded the highest surplus 
(see the table on pp. 30 f., item 7). This state is

3 Uncertainty is also reflected in the rather high revision of 
the cyclical component in 2020. Cyclical factors in 2020 are 
no longer assessed as unfavourably as they were in last 
year’s report (improvement of €6½  billion): macroeco -
nomic developments are not as far below trend levels any -
more due to calculations using new data and projections 
revising trend levels downwards. The cyclical component of 
2021 could be revised in a similar way, especially if energy 
shortages have a greater dampening impact on macroeco -
nomic developments than assumed in the 2022 spring pro -

creased sharply.4 At the lower end of the range, 
Bremen’s budget was balanced. In the absence 
of budgetary recovery assistance from central 
government, Bremen as well as Saarland would 
have recorded large partially adjusted deficits 
(€590 and €270 per capita, respectively).
State government and local government tax 
revenue accounted for just over two- thirds of 
their total revenue, rising sharply overall. How -
ever, there are considerable differences in per 
capita revenue. For example, the spread among 
the non- city states reached €880, with the fig -
ure for Hesse (€5,900) being 18% higher than 
that of Saxony-  Anhalt (see also the tables on 
pp. 30 f., item 19). There are multiple reasons 
for these differences. For example, the financial 
equalisation scheme (including supplementary 
central government grants that are dependent 
on financial capacity) does not fully even out 
varying levels of tax revenue. It should also be 
borne in mind that state and local governments 
sometimes have different tax rates and multi -pliers. Differences in revenue resulting from this 
remain hidden in the financial equalisation 
scheme. The way the scheme is set up,5 the dif -
ferences remain smaller and the ranking 
changes. In 2021, the spectrum ranged from 
just under 98% in Bremen to 108% in Bavaria.6
In addition to strong tax revenue, almost all 
federal states received higher central govern -
ment grants (see the table on pp. 32 f., item 
21). This was due primarily to an increase in 
central government funds for transfers to en -
terprises in 2021 in response to the coronavirus 
pandemic. To the extent that state govern -
ments pass on these funds as intended, they 
do not ease the burden on state government 
budgets.7 However, according to a survey of 
finance ministries, some federal states did not

high financial capacity and was required to hand over VAT 
funds to recipient federal states under the financial equal -
isation scheme. This comparison is based on the provisional 
settlement of financial equalisation for 2021. Nevertheless, 
Rhineland-  Palatinate’s structural position remains over -
stated by around €200 per capita. The main reason for this 
is that the exceptional increases in local business tax in 
2021 are not reflected in the financial equalisation scheme 
until 2022. For more on this and on further distortions, e.g. 
from the lagged allocation of corporation tax to other fed -
eral states that are home to operating sites, see Weiß et al. 
(2022).

overall, while the result for the current year is 
correspondingly less favourable.8
Looking at the federal states as a whole, ex -
penditure growth was mainly concentrated in 
the categories of other operating expenditure, 
personnel and current transfers to enterprises. 
The differences between individual federal 
states were considerable in some cases. These 
are only partly attributable to federal states fo -
cusing on different areas of expenditure; they 
are also due, amongst other things, to the fact 
that the federal states do not record business 
aid financed from central government funds in 
a uniform manner. It seems to be not least for 
this reason that payments to enterprises and 
other operating expenditure, for example, vary 
so widely from state to state. The central and 
state government budgetary planning system 
to be used throughout Germany is actually in -
tended to prevent such discrepancies in record -
ing methods. Action is needed to ensure that 
identical forms of expenditure are also identi -
cally categorised.
Social benefits at the local government level 
are the prime component of transfers to house -
holds (see the table on pp. 30 f., item 14). How -
ever, they do not reflect the actual burdens at 
the state and local government level as central 
government partly offsets burdens, leaving 
state and local governments with correspond -
ingly higher revenue. For example, central gov -
ernment pays just under three- quarters of the 
accommodation costs for recipients of un -
employment benefit II. In the case of the basic 
allowance for the elderly and for persons with 
reduced earning capacity, it even reimburses 
the transfers in full.9
Debt and interest burden across the federal 
states
On aggregate, the per capita debt of state and 
local governments stood at €10,000.10 Bremen 
recorded by far the highest figure of just over 
€54,000, followed by Hamburg with slightly 
more than €21,000. At the other end of the scale, Bavaria and Saxony each reported around 
€2,800.
Although the budgets as a whole recorded a 
surplus, aggregate debt rose by a total of 
€9 billion, or €110 per capita (see the table on 
pp.  32 f., item 23). The fiscal balance and 
change in debt diverged even more strongly in 
some federal states: among non- city states, per 
capita debt grew most strongly in North Rhine- Comparability

8 The situation in Bavaria is different. Undisbursed receipts 
from central government for business aid were evidently 
still included in the monthly cash statistics at the end of the 
year. Revenue from central government of €2 billion (€160 
per capita) was taken off the books when they were 
closed, which appears to have prevented there being a leg -
acy burden in the current year.
9 The notable increase in transfers in Saarland appears to 
be due to a misclassification of central government-  
provided coronavirus aid for businesses.
10 The figures presented here are taken from the debt stat -
istics of the Federal Statistical Office. These cover debt to 
the non- public and public sectors. Debt as defined under 
budget law can additionally include unused borrowing au -
thorisations, which are thus available as a reserve. The cor -
responding amount of borrowing on the capital market is 
then still outstanding.Deutsche Bundesbank

Westphalia (+€640). At the same time, how -
ever, the state closed the year with a moderate 
surplus. Although Bremen recorded a slight 
deficit, its per capita debt fell most sharply from 
a high level (-€4,180), with the state repaying 
loans related to interest rate derivatives. These 
derivatives hedge long- term interest rate condi -
tions. As market interest rates rose, the nega -
tive market value of the derivatives fell below 
their end-2020 level, and Bremen required less 
cash collateral to finance them.11
The calculated average rate of interest on 
debt12 continued to fall on the year for the fed -
eral states as a whole, but only slightly, declin -
ing to 1.5% (see the tables on pp. 30-33, item 
24 in each case). Although federal states are 
able to borrow under similar conditions, there 
are significant differences between their aver -
age rates of interest. The reasons for this con -
cern debt structure (e.g. varying fixation periods 
and times at which loans were taken out) and 
interest rate hedges. Differing premia on bond issues probably also contributed to the vari -
ance.13 However, data on such factors are 
often lacking. Last year, the highest average 
rates of interest were calculated for Baden-  
Württemberg (3.1%). As in the previous year, 
Saxony recorded the lowest average rate of 
interest (0.9%). In Baden-  Württemberg, aver -
age rates of interest rose particularly signifi -
cantly, climbing by 0.5 percentage point. How -
ever, this is due solely to one debt instrument, 
which accumulated interest obligations for a 
decade that fell due last year.14 The average 
rate of interest fell most sharply in Bavaria, 
where debt increased particularly strongly in re -
lation to its starting point in 2020 without 
interest expenditure rising in the process.
Besides interest expenditure, some federal 
states also generate considerable interest in -
come. Interest payments between core budgets 
and off- budget entities (transactions that the 
government finance statistics do not consoli -
date) often play a key role in this context. The 
net interest burden denotes the difference be -
tween interest expenditure and interest income 
and, in this respect, the total burden arising 
from debt instruments issued and purchased. 
The largest net interest burden (per capita) was 
recorded by the city states and Saarland (see 
the table on pp. 30 f., item 8). In Bremen, the 
net interest burden accounted for 8% of total 
expenditure, which was attributable to current 
payments for derivatives to a significant ex -
tent.15 In Saarland, its share amounted to 4%. 
However, these particular states receive special 
support of €400 million per year in each case

for their debt burdens, which are well above 
average. Deducting this budgetary recovery as -
sistance provided by central government from 
their net interest burden, the ratios fall to 3% in 
Bremen and -1½% in Saarland. By way of com -

State government debt 
brakes in 2021
Difficult to keep track of debt 
brakes
The federal states have designed their debt 
brakes very differently.16 As a result, their ac -
counts can be compared to a limited extent 
only. Furthermore, not all states have yet pro -
vided comprehensive accounts for 2021.17 The 
overview presented in this article is therefore 
incomplete.
In particular, the way in which reserves, special 
funds and budgetary authorisations carried for -
ward to subsequent years interact with the 
debt brakes is confusing. Yet it is these very re -
lationships that proved especially significant 
during the coronavirus crisis, as the federal 
states in some cases took out extensive emer -
gency loans to top up reserves and special 
funds. In some instances, borrowing authorisa -
tions, too, are carried forward to future years 
(see also the box on p. 25).
The coronavirus pandemic meant that state 
governments (much like central government) 
were in a difficult situation until well into last 
year. Against this backdrop, most state govern -
ments (as well as central government) once 
again activated their debt brake escape 
clauses. Berlin, Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania, 
Rhineland-Palatinate and Thuringia, however, 
did not, planning instead to use reserves to bal -
ance their budgets. Rhineland- Palatinate was an exception, only reporting net cyclical bor -
rowing in its budget plan.
In response to the Bundesbank’s requests for 
information or in budget documents, the fed -
eral states (non- city states excluding the local 
government level) reported taking out emer -
gency loans in excess of €18 billion (€220 per 
capita) on balance overall in the 2021 financial 
year. At the same time, the federal states as an 
aggregate, including their off- budget entities, 
recorded a surplus (before adjustment). The 
following section gauges the extent to which 
the various states have used these emergency 
loans to build reserves.
Bundesbank calculation 
 approximates structural annual 
financing needs
In this report, the Bundesbank provides a calcu -
lation of the structural fiscal balances approxi -
mate to the debt brake for the federal states 
for analytical purposes. The results indicate the 
extent to which borrowing under the escape 
clause (or recourse to existing reserves) would 
have been necessary to finance a structural def -
icit incurred in 2021.
Specifically, this back- of- the- envelope calcula -
tion is based uniformly on the balance of state 
governments’ core budgets and off- budget en -
tities, even though some states do not include 
off- budget entities in their debt brakes. This en -
sures that the actual budgetary situation is not 
obscured by, for instance, core budgets pre-  
financing off- budget entities. In addition, fo -
cusing on the balance takes into account the 
fundamental principle of budgets operating on 
an annual basis, because the balance only 
covers cash inflows and outflows for the period Comparison

in question and is therefore not influenced by 
the fact that funds have been withdrawn from 
or added to reserves. By contrast, changes in 
reserves do have an impact on net borrowing 
in the budget (the target variable underlying 
most debt brakes): it falls if existing reserves are 
used and rises when reserves are formed.
In line with the rules for all debt brakes, the 
local government level is included for city states 
only. Cyclical effects and financial transactions 
have also been adjusted in accordance with 
state- specific rules based on the data provided 
by the federal states. The calculations thus indi -
cate which emergency loans would have been 
necessary to cover the financing needs of the 
federal states and their off- budget entities, fol -
lowing state- specific adjustment rules.
This calculation of structural financing require -
ments approximate to the debt brake is then 
compared with the emergency borrowing re -
ported by the federal states. The difference in -dicates the extent to which reserves were ei -
ther formed from emergency loans or used to 
limit the scope of emergency borrowing. If, for 
example, a state tops up reserves, the emer -
gency loan taken out is higher than the balance 
calculated by the Bundesbank here.
Calculations point to high 
levels of reserve formation 
in individual federal states
Five states concluded 2021 without new emer -
gency loans on balance. Rhineland- Palatinate 
deserves particular mention here, as it repaid all 
of its emergency loans taken out in the previ -
ous year. While Schleswig- Holstein repaid 
somewhat more emergency loans per capita 
than Rhineland- Palatinate, this was only a small 
fraction of the very large amount that the state 
had taken out in 2020. According to its longer-

ade. Berlin, Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania and 
Thuringia left their respective stocks of emer -
gency loans unchanged. Thuringia and Berlin 
used previously formed reserves to finance 
their deficit.
In total, state governments took out new emer -
gency loans in excess of €220 per capita. Baden-  
Württemberg, Hesse and Saxony remained well 
below this figure. In Baden-  Württemberg, how -
ever, the favourable structural balance (calcu -
lated with a considerable cyclical burden)18 
would have enabled it to repay a significant 
amount of its emergency loans. Instead, it in -
creased its reserves using new emergency bor -
rowing and at the expense of its control ac -
count. Meanwhile, Hesse recorded a structural 
deficit. In this case, the unadjusted surplus 
achieved was not sufficient to offset the high 
level of cyclical relief calculated on a state-  
specific basis. The calculation suggests that, on 
balance, Hesse used reserves to limit new debt 
resulting from the pandemic. In Saxony, trans -
fers to the pension fund caused its deficit to be 
lower than its take- up of emergency borrowing. 
In making relatively high annual transfers to the 
pension fund, the state is complying with a re -
quirement set out in its constitution.
Emergency borrowing stood above the average 
of €220 per capita – in some cases only slightly 
so  – in eight federal states. Bavaria, North 
Rhine-  Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saarland and 
Hamburg (in ascending order) recorded up to 
€500. Bavaria, Hamburg and Saarland had 
structural financing needs. In Bavaria and Saar -
land, however, these were considerably lower 
than the emergency loans they took out.19 The

gency loans (above €500 per capita). Accord -
ing to the back- of- the- envelope calculation, 
these states, too, used the emergency loans to 
build up reserves – to a large extent in some 
cases.
However, using emergency loans to build up 
reserves for the future seems questionable. It 
makes budgets less transparent and under -
mines the principle of annuality. Using reserves 
at a later date to finance expenditure not re -
lated to the crisis would – at the very least – be 
incompatible with the intention of the debt 
brake.20 Instead, in a better- than- anticipated 
financial situation, it would stand to reason 
that fewer emergency loans be taken out or 
that existing ones be repaid. Should the situ -
ation flare up again in the following years, it 
would then be up to the state parliaments to 
declare a new emergency. This would need to 
be justified by the developments at that time. 
New, targeted emergency borrowing would 
then be approved as appropriate. At the same time, the choice of specific crisis management 
measures would need thorough justification.
Repayments
The debt brakes require the federal states to 
draw up repayment schedules for the emer -
gency loans they take out. At the end of 2021, 
the federal states reported a total volume with 
pending repayment of €71 billion (€850 per 
capita). Some states are planning to take out 
additional emergency loans this year as well. 
On the other hand, sizeable reserves are avail -
able (see also the box on p. 25) with which the 
federal states could repay emergency loans. If 
they were to make use of these, repayments 
would not burden their budgets. The repay -

State government reserves as at the end of 2021

government reserves. Even using the 
budget accounts for 2020, which are now 
available, it would only be possible to com-
pile such an overview with a great deal of 
effort. The number of reserve pots is too 
large. Although the use of such funds is re-
stricted by law, it stands to reason that they 
could be mobilised, if necessary, for other 
purposes – possibly via legislative changes. 
Gathering data on reserve stocks is import-
ant in order to better gauge the state of 
state government fi  nances. These data are 
therefore signifi  cant, not least for Germa-
ny’s central fi  scal surveillance body, the Sta-
bility Council. Consequently, it is vital for 
the Stability Council to ensure the availabil-
ity of better, clearer data.
For this Monthly Report, the state govern-
ments were asked about their reserve stocks 
as at the end of 2021. They provided more 
detailed information on stocks in pre- 
 fi  nanced special funds and reserves. In add-
ition to these, other reserves may also exist. 
For example, some state governments are 
incurring budget liabilities (which count to-
wards the debt brake) and, at the same 
time, carrying forward expenditure appro-
priations funded by these liabilities (residual 
expenditure) to later years. In Bavaria’s 
2021 budget accounts, for example, these 
amounted to €14 billion (including residual 
expenditure connected to the pandemic). In 
Baden-Württemberg’s 2020 budget ac-
counts, they came to just under €7 billion. 
In addition, there is scope for expenditure 
of €4 billion stemming from unused bor-
rowing authorisations from previous years. 
In the survey, however, this stock was not 
reported as reserves.
The state governments reported stocks of 
around €110 billion in reserves and special 
funds. The stocks listed below include both 
new reserves resulting from the coronavirus 
crisis and older reserves:– The reported general reserves increased 
somewhat, reaching €33 billion by the 
end of 2021. The general reserves per 
capita are particularly high in Bremen 
and Berlin.
– The cumulative surpluses from 2020 and 
2021 created reserves of €12 billion in 
coronavirus special funds. Hesse dis-
solved its special fund with reserves of 
just under €1 billion following a ruling by 
the state’s constitutional court. The per 
capita increase in Saxony-Anhalt was 
particularly large. This state formed its 
coronavirus special fund via borrowing in 
the core budget at the end of 2021.
– Reserves in pre-fi  nanced off-budget en-
tities for investment purposes fell by just 
under one-third to €7 billion. Transfers to 
other reserve pots appear to have con-
tributed to this decline.
– Civil servant pensions place a consider-
able burden on state government 
budgets, especially in the western Ger-
man states. State governments provi-
sioned the largest amounts overall for 
these costs. The reported stock rose sig-
nifi  cantly, climbing by one-tenth to 
€49 billion. At €2,340 per capita, Saxony 
has by far the highest provisions in rela-
tion to the size of its population. Other 
state governments have stopped fi  lling 
up such stocks in recent years and – as in 
the case of Saarland and Bremen, for ex-
ample – are already drawing markedly 
on these reserves.
The other reserves reported by the state 
governments come to €7 billion. The bulk 
of this total was attributable to a collective 
item reported by Schleswig-Holstein, which, 
as evidenced by the 2020 budget accounts, 
largely constituted provisions for pandemic- 
 related budgetary burdens.Deutsche Bundesbank

vary considerably. Rhineland- Palatinate has al -
ready repaid its emergency loans in full. By con -
trast, the total repayment burden stemming 
from emergency borrowing is particularly high 
in Berlin (at around €1,990 per capita),21 
Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania and Schleswig-  
Holstein (at around €1,750 per capita in each 
case). The repayment deadlines are also very 
different: the longest deadlines are in North 
Rhine-  Westphalia, at up to 50 years.
Concluding remarks
Use of emergency borrowing 
and outlook
The debt brakes allow higher loans to be taken 
out if required in an emergency. However, there 
is a risk of excessive recourse to the escape 
clauses undermining the debt brakes. Emer -
gency borrowing in connection with the 
coronavirus crisis should therefore only be used 
for measures that are necessary to combat this 
specific crisis. This also applies to the use of re -
serves built up from emergency loans. Further -
more, the fundamental principle of budgets 
operating on an annual basis implies that emer -
gency borrowing authorisations should be for a 
specific financial year. An improvement in 
budgetary developments can mean that emer -
gency loans are no longer needed. In that case, 
it would not make sense to set these borrow -
ing authorisations aside for later use. In the 
spirit of the debt brake, then, there is much to 
be said for the states promptly liquidating re -
serves that they have ultimately built up using 
emergency loans justified by the coronavirus 
pandemic. This would prevent inappropriate 
use of funds and reduce the subsequent repay -
ment burden.
State government finances have so far re -
mained in good shape this year. To date, there 
are signs of a sharp rise in unadjusted sur -
pluses. This is due to very high tax revenue, 
which is considerably higher than was forecast 
in the last pre- crisis tax estimate for 2022. An -other reason for the surpluses is that central 
government bears most of the non- tax burdens 
associated with the pandemic and the war in 
Ukraine. This is reflected not least in the very 
different budgetary positions of central govern -
ment and the state governments. More specif -
ically, central government is likely to still record 
a large structural deficit in 2022. By contrast, 
the structural state government budget surplus 
could even be higher than before the corona -
virus crisis. Based on their favourable budgetary 
situation and sizeable reserves, it does not ap -
pear self-  evident that state governments will 
need to take out emergency loans again this 
year.22
The future outlook is fraught with uncertainty 
as a result of the war in Ukraine and the asso -
ciated energy crisis. Real growth is weakening, 
but price dynamics are increasing government 
revenue. Overall, state governments will enter 
next year with a good structural starting pos -
ition. Central government is assuming the bulk 
of burdens resulting from the fallout of the 
Ukraine war, such as the energy crisis. The 
good financial situation should enable the fed -
eral states to make a considerable contribution 
to the current financial challenges. The new tax 
estimate at the end of October will provide an 
updated basis for budget planning.Do not under -

21 The high repayment burden in Berlin is due to the fact 
that the emergency loans taken out there in 2020 were 
also for cyclical burdens. The latter amounted to €620 per 
capita.
22 Saarland is pursuing its own course. It receives extensive 
budgetary recovery assistance from central government, 
not least to help shoulder its very high debt. In order to 
cope with elevated transformation burdens, partly as a re -
sult of the Ukraine war, Saarland is planning to launch a 
credit- financed special fund of €3 billion (just over €3,000 
per capita and thus, for example, higher than Bavaria’s 
total per capita debt), for a term of one decade. The funds 
are intended to finance the restructuring of industrial sites, 
but also to finance energy efficiency improvements in 
state- owned buildings and investment in universities. The 
projects have yet to be outlined in detail. To a large extent, 
however, they relate to the state’s normal tasks and do not 
appear especially linked to an emergency situation caused 
by the war in Ukraine. Hence, such extensive additional 
borrowing is inconsistent with the intention of the escape 
clause and is even less in keeping with central govern -
ment’s budgetary recovery assistance.Deutsche Bundesbank

Cyclical adjustment should be 
reviewed
Cyclical components are calculated differently 
by each federal state and can vary widely. For 
example, despite the sharp economic down -
turn, the tax level procedures for 2020 identi -
fied almost no negative cyclical components. 
These procedures, in particular, require high re -
serves or safety margins. If these reserves or 
margins are depleted at the start of a down -
turn, it is no longer possible to maintain a 
steady budget under the regular debt brake. 
Hamburg’s tax trend procedure should actually 
have done better here. Yet, in 2020, calcula -
tions using this procedure identified consider -
able cyclical relief.23
The impact of cyclical effects on state govern -
ment finances (see the table on p. 22, column 
3) continued to range from high relief (for ex -
ample, in Bremen, at €600 per capita) to per -
sistently large burdens (in Berlin, for instance, 
at €210 per capita) in the 2021 reporting year. 
Given the state government financial equalisa -
tion scheme and the similarity of economic de -
velopments across Germany, this is difficult to 
comprehend and economically unconvincing. 
Where cyclical components are so different, 
the structural key figures of the states’ debt 
brakes cannot be compared either. To ensure 
that the comparison across states is meaning -
ful, alternative calculations, such as those pre -
sented in the first part of this report on finan -
cial results, are therefore required. The tables 
agreed by the Stability Council for debt brake 
accounting for all state governments are not 
suitable for this purpose,24 as they are not suf -
ficiently harmonised.
Initial experience with cyclical adjustment at 
the central and state government levels sug -
gests that most procedures should be revised. 
It seems expedient to look into harmonising 
the various cyclical adjustment procedures 
practised by state governments. The Bundes -
bank has presented a proposal to reform cen -
tral government’s cyclical adjustment proced -ure: namely, introducing an estimation error 
component, which could stabilise budgetary 
policy.25 This would benefit state government 
finances, in particular, where expenditure vol -
umes are more rigid than at the central govern -
ment level. The procedure would therefore also 
be closer to a tax trend procedure, such as the 
one used by Rhineland- Palatinate.
Essential to enhance dataset
The Stability Council is Germany’s central insti -
tution for fiscal surveillance. Budgetary surveil -
lance would benefit from the publication of an 
informative set of data.26 Even in less uncertain 
times, it is very difficult to obtain an overview 
of the need or scope for action in the individual 
federal states. Conducting even a retrospective 
analysis of fiscal developments, structural 
budgetary positions, reserve stocks and repay -
ment obligations is immensely challenging. In 
order to be able to monitor budgets effectively, 
meaningful data on respective state govern -
ment budget outturns and budgetary planning 
as well as on the need for action are required. 
A major step in the right direction would be for 
each state to provide clear information show -
ing how each new tax estimate affects its 
budget. In a similar vein, regular updates could 
be made to show what state- specific budget -
ary effects are caused by changes in tax law 
enacted in the meantime and what cyclical 
components arise as a result of a new macro -
economic projection by the Federal Govern -
ment. Available reserves would have to be 
clearly presented. This should not just apply to 
the current budget at any given time, but also 
to plans for the following years.States use differ -

Generally speaking, the benefits of the federal 
system should be put to better use. It would be 
expedient to present the budget outturns of and public services rendered by the individual 
federal states on the basis of a robust set of 
data to aid comparability between the states.Make better use

Member States’ financial relationships with 
the EU budget and the Next Generation EU 
off- budget entity in 2021
Last year, the regular EU budget amounted to €165 billion, or just over 1% of the European 
Union’s gross national income (EU GNI). As usual, this was financed by the EU Member States 
roughly in proportion to the sizes of their economies, with each contributing around 1% of their 
respective GNI. Cohesion and agricultural policy once again accounted for more than two- thirds 
of expenditure. The vast majority of EU budget expenditure takes the form of earmarked transfers 
to individual Member States. Relative to their GNI, Member States with weaker economies tend 
to receive more transfers than those with stronger economies. In 2021, ten Member States were 
net contributors; these included Germany, which contributed 0.6% of its GNI. The other 17 coun -
tries were net recipients.
The EU budget generally redistributes financial resources from higher- performing Member States 
to lower- performing ones (as measured by per capita GNI). With few exceptions, the per capita 
incomes of net contributors are above the EU average, while those of net recipients are below it. 
Furthermore, within the two groups, the amounts of per capita net contributions are roughly con -
tingent on economic performance.
In addition to the regular EU budget, 2021 saw the inaugural year of the Next Generation EU 
(NGEU) off- budget entity, which is set to operate for a total of six years. Initially, EU Member 
States are not paying contributions for NGEU, as it is being financed by joint borrowing. These 
debts are to be repaid out of the EU budget between 2028 and 2058. During that period, Mem -
ber States will make commensurately higher contributions or assign revenue from other sources 
to the EU. In 2021, the first year of NGEU disbursements, the transfers paid out of the off- budget 
entity amounted to €54 billion, or just under ½% of EU GNI. This represents around one- eighth 
of the total allocated NGEU transfers.
The final, net contributions to NGEU will only be known for certain once the loans taken to 
finance the package have been repaid. Nevertheless, it is possible to estimate these at present, so 
as to give a more comprehensive picture of the Member States’ financial relationships with the 
EU. As things stand today, it is to be assumed that Member States will continue to finance future 
EU budgets roughly in line with their shares of GNI. It therefore makes sense to take the current 
GNI shares as a funding key for NGEU transfers. When viewed in those terms, the net contribu -
tors in the EU budget generally prove to be similarly positioned when it comes to NGEU. For 
instance, Germany’s net payments to NGEU amounted to 0.3% of its GNI in 2021. Italy was the 
only Member State that turned from a net contributor to a net recipient on balance as a result of 
NGEU. For most of the 17 countries that were net recipients of the EU budget in 2021, NGEU 
increased the net payments received. The allocated NGEU transfers are thus set to echo the redis -
tribution pattern seen with the EU budget.Deutsche Bundesbank

Member States’ net contri -
butions reveal financial 
relationships  with the EU
Aim of the article
This article looks at the financial relationships 
between the EU and its Member States. To this 
end, Member States’ net contributions to the 
EU budget and NGEU in 2021 are calculated.
The net contributions to the EU budget and 
NGEU reveal whether a given Member State’s 
financial relationship with the EU relieves or 
burdens its finances on balance. In this way, 
they shed light on the extent to which financial 
resources are redistributed between the coun -
tries of the EU. The degree of reallocation and 
the instruments used to achieve it are the sub -
ject of mutual agreement between the Mem -
ber States. The net contributions are the result 
of these agreements.
The figures on net contributions should be in -
terpreted with caution. In particular, they do 
not provide a measure of the benefits that EU 
membership brings to a country, as these are 
far more multi- faceted than the financial rela -
tionship alone. For example, enterprises and 
households in all Member States benefit from 
the single market and its four freedoms (free 
movement of persons, goods, services and 
capital). In addition, payments that flow to in -
dividual Member States can also have positive 
spillover effects on other countries. This article 
does not discuss such effects, nor does it cover 
other, non- economic ones. Instead, its goal is 
to provide a transparent picture of the payment 
flows associated with the EU’s common 
budgets. Using the data available from the 
European Commission, the article depicts the 
payment flows relevant for net contributions in 
2021 (see the adjacent box). In addition, it 
compares the 2021 net contributions with 
those of previous years.Article outlines

Up to and including 2018, Member 
States’ net contributions could be taken 
from the European Commission’s an-
nual Financial Reports. The Financial Re-
port contained Member States’ operat-
ing budgetary balances,1 which are a 
suitable measure of net contributions 
and are also used as such in this article 
(see the box on p. 38).
For 2019 and subsequent years, the 
European Commission replaced the 
Financial Report with the Integrated 
Financial and Accountability Reporting,2 
which no longer shows operating 
budgetary balances. However, operat-
ing budgetary balances were still initially 
included in the fi  gures published on the 
European Commission’s website.3
For 2020 and 2021, information on the 
Member States’ net contributions is no 
longer provided. However, the net con-
tributions can be derived from the EU 
budget’s annual spending and revenue 
fi  gures, which were last published by 
the European Commission on 28 Sep-
tember 2022.4 For 2021, these fi  gures 
also contain a breakdown of expend-
iture and revenue by country for the 
Next Generation EU (NGEU) instrument.

Overview of the EU budget 
and NGEU
The EU budget is used by the Member States to 
finance joint spending. They determine the na -
ture and volume of expenditure in advance, 
drawing up a seven- year financial framework. 
The current financial framework covers the 
period from 2021 to 2027 and provides for an -
nual revenue and expenditure equivalent to 
around 1% of EU GNI.1 These are roughly the 
same as the amounts involved in the 2014 to 
2020 financial framework. Expenditure prior -
ities have also shifted only minimally (see the 
chart above). Owing to Brexit in 2020, EU 
Member States drew up the financial frame -
work without the United Kingdom.
Most of the EU’s budgetary expenditure flows 
to the Member States in the form of earmarked 
transfers. Within the Member States, it finances 
projects and spending in the pre- agreed areas. 
Own resources are the dominant source of rev -
enue for the EU budget. These include customs 
duties (traditional own resources) and pay -
ments from Member States (also known as 
contributions). Member States’ payments are 
determined on the basis of various national 
metrics: gross national income (GNI- based own 
resource), (standardised) value added tax rev -
enue (VAT- based own resource) and, more re -cently, also the amount of non- recycled plastic 
packaging waste (plastics own resource). 
Alongside the own resources, a smaller role is 
played by other EU budget revenue sources 
such as antitrust penalties or fines paid by 
Member States. The EU budget is balanced 
every year. In principle, there is no provision for 
debt financing. GNI- based own resources are 
therefore calculated in such a way as to ensure 
that EU budget expenditure is always covered.
Calculating net contributions
Individual Member States’ financial relation -
ships with the EU budget are generally not bal -
anced, resulting in either a positive or negative 
net contribution. In broad terms, this is repre -
sented by the difference between a Member 
State’s payments received from the EU budget 
and its payments made to the EU budget. If the 
balance is positive, the country receives net 
payments from the EU budget and is thus a net EU budgetary 
framework for 
2021 to 2027

1 GNI was selected as the reference variable for the EU 
budget. Gross national income and gross domestic product 
(GDP) differ in the extent to which household income is in -
cluded. GNI encompasses the entire income of all resi -
dents, regardless of whether it was generated domestically 
or abroad. GDP , on the other hand, only incorporates total 
income generated domestically. The difference between a 
country’s GNI and GDP is typically small; in the cases of Ire -
land and Luxembourg, however, GDP is significantly higher 
than GNI.Deutsche Bundesbank

Operating budgetary balances as a measure 
of net  contributions to the EU budget
Net contributions to the EU budget should 
show whether a country is a net contribu-
tor or a net recipient in terms of the EU 
budget. To this end, this article uses the 
concept of the European Commission’s op-
erating budgetary balances.1 This box de-
scribes how the operating balances are cal-
culated.
First, certain categories are excluded from 
the total revenue and expenditure of the EU 
budget:
– Only the GNI own resource, the VAT 
own resource and the plastics own re-
source are included on the revenue side 
of the EU budget. Customs duties, on 
the other hand, are not taken into ac-
count because Member States collect 
tariffs at the EU’s external borders on be-
half of the EU and pass them on to the 
EU budget. Owing to the single market 
and the tariff- free trade within the EU, 
these cannot be assigned to individual 
countries in any meaningful way. This is 
illustrated particularly clearly by the 
Netherlands and Belgium, which col-
lected a large share of the customs rev-
enue because of the major ports located 
in Rotterdam and Antwerp. However, 
the tariffs primarily apply to products 
destined for other EU countries. As a re-
sult, the two countries’ fi  nancial burden 
would be overstated if the customs du-
ties transferred were to be included in 
the payments to the EU.
– On the expenditure side, of the expend-
iture that fl  ows to the Member States, 
only the operating expenditure is taken 
into account. To do so, administrative ex-
penditure is factored out. This is because 
it is used to fi  nance services that benefi  t 
the EU as a whole, such as to pay the 
salaries of those working for EU institu-tions. A disproportionately large share of 
the administrative expenditure fl  ows to 
Belgium and Luxembourg, where the 
major EU institutions and their staff are 
based. If administrative expenditure were 
to be taken into account, the share of 
the payments from the EU budget to 
these countries would be too high. From 
2021 onwards, the debt servicing costs 
(interest and repayments) for transfers 
from the Next Generation EU (NGEU) 
off- budget entity will also be disre-
garded. NGEU debt servicing costs are 
paid from the current EU budget. This 
article reports the net contribution for 
NGEU separately, thus preventing double 
counting. (For details on the calculation 
of net contributions in connection with 
NGEU, see p. 39.) In 2021, however, debt 
servicing costs were still negligible at €3 
million.
Second, a correction is made to ensure that 
payments to the EU budget correspond to 
payments from the EU budget, despite the 
adjustments to revenue and expenditure.
– Member States’ payments to the EU 
budget are adjusted proportionally so 
that their sum corresponds to the total 
operating expenditure. In technical 
terms, the balance of customs duties on 
the one hand and administrative expend-
iture and NGEU debt servicing costs on 
the other is allocated proportionally to 
the Member States. The share that a 
country contributes to the fi  nancing of 
the EU budget remains unchanged. The 
difference between operating expend-
iture and the adjusted payments to the 
EU budget yields the reported net contri-
butions to the EU budget.

recipient. If the balance is negative, the country 
makes net payments to the EU budget and is 
thus a net contributor. A more detailed explan -
ation of how net contributions are calculated 
can be found on p. 38 of this report.
The EU budget was accompanied by the NGEU 
off- budget entity for the first time in 2021. Set 
to run until 2026, NGEU is intended to disburse 
transfers totalling approximately €420 billion 
and loans of up to €390 billion to Member 
States over its lifetime.2 Although this off-  
budget entity is being financed through bor -
rowing rather than by contemporaneous con -
tributions from Member States, it is possible to 
calculate net contributions for NGEU, too (see 
the adjacent box). This allows the financial rela -
tionships between the EU and its Member 
States to be depicted more accurately in eco -
nomic terms.
The EU budget in 2021
The 2021 EU budget comprised expenditure of 
around €165 billion.3 This equates to just over 
1% of EU GNI. Roughly €10 billion of this was 
allocated to administrative expenditure, which 
has been disregarded for the purposes of cal -
culating the net contributions discussed in this 
article (see the box on p. 38). At 6%, the share 
of total expenditure accounted for by adminis -
trative expenditure remained unchanged com -
pared with the 2014 to 2020 financial frame -
work.4 Around €20 billion of expenditure was 
covered by EU customs revenue, which has 
likewise been excluded from the calculations of 
net contributions.
At 12%, the share of customs duties in total 
own resources was somewhat lower than in 
the 2014 to 2020 financial framework, in which 
it averaged just under 15% annually. This was 
partly due to the fact that Member States are Additional net

downCalculating net contribu-
tions in connection with 
NGEU
The Next Generation EU (NGEU) off- budget 
entity has a number of differences compared 
with the EU budget. These need to be taken 
into consideration when calculating net con-
tributions.
– Ultimately, NGEU is also fi  nanced through 
contributions from Member States. How-
ever, unlike the regular contribution- 
funded EU budget, these payments will 
only become due in later years. This is be-
cause, initially, the EU will borrow in order 
to fi  nance NGEU. For 2021 to 2027, the 
current EU fi  nancial framework allows 
only for interest payments on NGEU 
loans. For the period thereafter, Member 
States are obligated to provide the EU 
budget with suffi   cient funds to repay the 
loans. In this way, it is planned that the 
debts incurred for NGEU transfers will be 
successively repaid out of the regular EU 
budget from 2028 to 2058.
At present, Member States fi  nance the EU 
budget largely in accordance with their 
GNI shares. It seems plausible that this 
will continue to be the case in the future, 
even if additional own resources are used 
to fund the EU budget. As things stand 
today, the contribution burdens of NGEU 
transfers may therefore be allocated to 
the Member States according to their GNI 
shares in the respective years in which the 
transfers are disbursed. This results in the 
same net contributions as would be paid 
if the Member States were to fund NGEU 
via the regular EU budget instead of 
through borrowing. This is because add-
itional expenditure in the EU budget is 
fi  nanced by the Member States through 
higher GNI- based own resources and 
thus in accordance with their GNI shares.
– This box takes account only of NGEU 
transfers to Member States. NGEU loans 
are not included, as the borrower Member 
States are expected to service the associ-
ated debts in full themselves. As a result of 
their interest rate conditions being more 
favourable than those prevailing on the 
market, the loans in fact contain a transfer 
component as well. However, this is not 
taken into consideration in this report.2 All NGEU figures are shown in current prices.

now entitled to retain a larger share of customs 
revenue as flat- rate compensation for the col -
lection costs that they incur (25% instead of 
the previous 20%). The Netherlands and Bel -
gium are the main beneficiaries of this increase. 
This is because they account for a dispropor -
tionately large share of customs receipts, while 
their actual collection costs are likely to be sig -
nificantly lower. Consequently, the flat- rate 
compensation arrangement for collection costs 
is sometimes also seen as a hidden rebate for 
those countries. No further consideration is 
given to this in the following discussion, how -
ever.Operating expenditure  
in the EU budget
Operating expenditure totalled around €155 
billion in 2021. That year, cohesion policy ac -
counted for the largest share (approximately 
€68 billion), followed by agricultural policy (ap -
proximately €56 billion). The remaining €31 bil -
lion was allocated across the spending areas of 
research and infrastructure, external action and 
security and citizenship. The payments from 
the EU budget received by Member States dif -
fer significantly in relation to the sizes of their 
economies (see the adjacent chart). In 2021, 
the (unweighted) average ratio stood at 2% of 
each Member State’s GNI. Croatia had the 
highest ratio of 4% of GNI, while the Nether -
lands had the lowest at 0.3% of GNI.
Member States’ payments 
to the EU budget
Member States’ payments to the EU budget 
covered around €140 billion of expenditure in 
2021. By far the largest part of this was attrib -
utable to GNI- based own resources, which ac -
counted for 73% of total own resources (un -
changed from the annual average from 2014 
to 2020). The share of the VAT- based own re -
source, which is now calculated using a new 
method, stood at 11% in 2021 (13% on aver -
age from 2014 to 2020).
In 2021, Member States also contributed the 
plastics own resource to the EU budget for the 
first time. This comprised 4% of total own re -
sources. The relative burden among the coun -
tries shifted only slightly as a consequence of 
the plastics own resource (see the chart on 
p. 41), which was mainly due to its small size. 
In addition, Member States agreed on different 
flat- rate cuts for many countries. As a result, 
there is less variation between Member States 
with regard to the ratio of the plastics own re -
source to economy size.High degree of

All in all, Member States financed the 2021 EU 
budget roughly in line with the sizes of their 
economies: as in the past, payments did not 
differ significantly in relation to GNI (see the 
chart above). The chart also includes the re -
bates for Austria, Denmark, Germany, the 
Netherlands and Sweden. The Netherlands re -
ceived the largest rebate, at just under 0.2% of 
its GNI, while Germany received the smallest, 
at less than 0.1% of GNI. The (unweighted) 
average of own resources excluding customs 
duties across all EU Member States stood at 
just under 1.0% of each country’s GNI in 2021. 
The contributions of individual countries ranged from just under 0.8% of GNI in the Nether -
lands to just over 1.1% of GNI in Portugal.

the EU budget.
The adjacent chart shows the country- by- 
country distribution of NGEU funding over the 
past year in relation to each Member State’s 
GNI. At just over 1.5% of their respective GNI, 
Greece, Spain and Croatia received the largest 
shares of funds, whilst Ireland, the Nether -
lands, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Denmark and 
Germany received the smallest payments, 
amounting to less than 0.1% of GNI. RRF funds, 
which are generally earmarked, flow to Mem -
ber States at different speeds (see the chart 
below). In 2021, 14% of the total allocated 
funding was channelled to the Member States. 
Spain made the largest withdrawals, calling on 
25% of its allocated funds. RRF funds are yet to 
be received by seven Member States, including 
Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland. Relatively large 
amounts of funding have been allocated to 
these countries. In the cases of Poland and 
Hungary, disbursement has been delayed 
owing to conflicts in connection with the “rule 
of law” clause.5 In addition, no RRF funds were 
channelled to Finland, Sweden, the Nether -
lands or Ireland in 2021.
NGEU financing shares
In order to determine Member States’ net con -
tributions to NGEU, NGEU financing shares are 
compared with NGEU transfers received (see 
the box on p. 39). It is assumed that Member 
States will finance NGEU transfers according to 
their GNI shares in the respective year of dis -
bursement. As NGEU transfers amounted to 
0.4% of EU GNI in 2021, each Member State is 
deducted 0.4% of its GNI for NGEU transfers. 
Consequently, countries that received more 
than 0.4% of their GNI in NGEU funds in 2021 
are recorded as net recipients and countries 
that received less are recorded as net contribu -
tors.RRF transfers

Development of net 
 contributions to the EU 
budget and NGEU
EU budget and NGEU taken 
together
In 2021, Member States’ net contributions con -
sisted of two components for the first time: the 
net contribution from the EU budget and a net 
contribution from NGEU. On balance, nine of 
the 27 EU Member States were net contribu -
tors (see the adjacent chart). Germany’s net 
payments were the highest relative to its GNI, 
at 0.9%, followed by the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Denmark, Finland, France, Austria, Ireland and 
Belgium. NGEU was a factor for all these coun -
tries being net contributors. For example, ex -
cluding NGEU would have lowered Germany’s 
net contribution by 0.3  percentage point to 
0.6% of GNI. The 18 remaining EU Member 
States were net recipients. Relative to their 
GNI, Croatia and Greece received the highest 
net payments, amounting to more than 4%. 
Lithuania and Latvia ranked third and fourth, 
with net payments of more than 3% of GNI. 
Most of these countries received net payments 
from both the EU budget and NGEU, though 
the net payments from the EU budget were 
generally considerably larger. Only in the case 
of Spain were the net payments from NGEU 
higher. This was due to the fact that Spain 
withdrew a particularly large share of its RRF 
funds in 2021. Hungary, Bulgaria and Poland 
are recorded as net contributors to NGEU in 
2021, as no RRF funds have yet been chan -
nelled to these countries. However, this will 
change if they receive the RRF transfers that 
they have been allocated. Luxembourg is a net 
contributor to NGEU, but it receives larger net 
disbursements from the EU budget, making it a 
net recipient overall. Italy would have been a 
net contributor solely on the basis of the EU 
budget, but became a net recipient as a result 
of NGEU.Comparison with average 
net contributions from 2014 
to 2020
Both RRF and EU budget funds have been 
channelled unevenly to Member States over 
the years. This means that, even within a given 
financial framework, the level of net contribu -
tions can fluctuate from year to year and the 
ranking of countries in this respect can vary.

2020 financial framework, however, the groups

virtually unchanged in 2021 (see the upper ad -
jacent chart).
Compared with the average from 2014 to 
2020, Germany’s net contribution to the EU 
budget rose from 0.4% to just under 0.6% of 
its GNI. This was partly due to the fact that the 
United Kingdom was no longer a net contribu -
tor following its withdrawal from the EU. The 
German share of EU GNI increased from just 
under 22% to just over 25% as a result of 
Brexit. The German financing contribution to 
the EU budget rose accordingly. Among the net 
recipients, Croatia saw the steepest rise in its 
net payments, which amounted to around 
1.5  percentage point. Bulgaria and Hungary, 
amongst others, received significantly less 
funding.Germany’s net

Net contributions and 
 economic performance
Member States decide jointly how to redistrib -
ute funds through the EU budget and NGEU. In 
this context, it appears reasonable to reallocate 
these funds from higher- performing Member 
States to lower- performing ones. This can be 
measured, for example, in terms of per capita 
GNI. With regard to the EU budget, all net con -
tributors except Italy have a per capita GNI 
above the EU average and all net recipients ex -
cept Luxembourg have a per capita GNI below 
the EU average. In addition, the amount of the 
net payments made or received is based on 
economic performance. While this does not 
apply in the case of every individual country, it generally holds true. Per capita net contribu -
tions show a stronger response to differences 
in performance among net recipients than 
among net contributors. This pattern has been 
observed in the past and continued in the first 
year of the current financial framework (see the 
lower chart on p. 44).
NGEU transfers, as provided for in the alloca -
tion key, also tend to vary according to each 
Member State’s economic performance (see 
the chart above). As the very uneven outflow 
of NGEU transfer payments would distort the 
picture, the chart for 2021 shows the annual 
average net contribution over the entire frame -
work period of six years.Net contribu -
tions continue

The validity of interest parity in times 
of  crisis
A theoretical relationship exists between exchange rate developments and the interest rate differ -
ential between two currency areas. This relationship is referred to as interest parity. Here, a dis -
tinction is made between covered and uncovered interest parity. With covered interest parity, 
cross-  border investments are hedged against exchange rate changes. There is therefore no 
exchange rate risk when the transaction is concluded. In theory, the interest rate differential 
between the currency areas should correspond to the rate of change between the forward and 
spot rates. It should not be possible in this case to make a risk- free profit through trading (inter -
est rate arbitrage). With uncovered interest parity, investments in the other currency area are not 
hedged against exchange rate changes. Under simplified assumptions, the interest rate differen -
tial should correspond to the rate of change between the present and expected future spot rates.
This article begins by examining empirically whether interest parity in its various forms applies for 
the period up to the end of 2021. The analysis focuses primarily on the income from investing in 
three- month money in euro or alternative currencies. The observation period covers various cri -
ses, in particular the global financial crisis that began in 2007. It can be seen that the relationship 
between the interest rate differential and the exchange rate changed following the onset of the 
financial crisis. This was true of both forms of interest parity.
For example, deviations from covered interest parity are clearer and longer lasting than before 
the crisis. This applies not only between the euro and the US dollar, but also to a large number 
of other currency pairs. At first glance, such deviations from covered interest parity contradict the 
assumption usually made in financial market theory that risk- free profit opportunities cannot 
occur if market participants behave rationally. However, more detailed analyses show that the 
observed violations of covered interest parity are indeed compatible with rational behaviour. This 
is because financial market conditions have changed since the financial crisis. Important condi -
tions for the validity of covered interest parity were often no longer met to the same extent as 
before. For example, counterparty risk increased markedly during severe financial market turmoil, 
and financial market participants demanded a premium for taking it on. In addition, the costs of 
interest arbitrage were increased by the Basel III decisions, which were phased in as of 2013. This 
contrasted at times with one- sided and relatively price- inelastic demand for exchange rate hedg -
ing. Taken together, these factors allowed marked deviations to arise even outside times of crisis.
Since the financial crisis, a change has also taken place in the relationship between the exchange 
rate and interest rates on investments without exchange rate hedging. Trade strategies such as 
currency carry trades previously played a major role in this relationship. Market participants who 
were typically speculative preferred to invest in the currency that offered higher- interest invest -
ment opportunities. The associated capital movements led to a simultaneous appreciation of the 
higher- interest currency. Evidence of this empirical relationship, which is contrary to uncovered 
interest parity, can no longer be found in the period since the global financial crisis. However, it 
cannot be ruled out that this trading strategy will regain importance as interest rate differentials 
between the currency areas now grow larger again.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Interest parity theory describes the relationship 
between interest rate differential and exchange 
rate, taking into account the investment behav -
iour of investors. This theory states that, under 
some assumptions, the expected return on a 
fixed- interest investment in domestic currency 
matches that on an equivalent fixed- interest in -
vestment in foreign currency. Covered and un -
covered interest parity are distinguished via 
their different treatment of exchange rate risks. 
With covered interest parity, investors hedge 
their open foreign currency position by means 
of a forward transaction. With uncovered inter -
est parity, on the other hand, the open foreign 
currency position is left unhedged.
For example, fairly stable regularities can be 
found up to the outbreak of the financial crisis 
under covered interest parity. Deviations from 
covered interest parity were generally relatively 
small in the early years of monetary union and 
– taking into account transaction costs – were 
likely due to data imperfections rather than 
market inefficiencies, according to an empirical 
study in the 2005 Monthly Report.1 Since Au -
gust 2007, however, significant and longer-  
lasting deviations have been observed, some -
times even during calm market phases. This ap -
plies not only to the relationship between the 
euro and the US dollar, but also to that be -
tween the euro and a large number of other 
currencies. The more pronounced deviations 
from covered interest parity since then raise the 
question of why seemingly safe profit oppor -
tunities arising from arbitrage transactions are 
not exploited.
By contrast, empirical support for the un -
covered interest parity theory was low even be -
fore the outbreak of the financial crisis. The 
theory states that the currency in which the 
higher- interest, otherwise equally safe invest -
ment is denominated depreciates against the 
currency with the lower- interest investment 
over the term, so that the expected return on 
domestic and foreign interest instruments is the same. However, one result of the empirical 
studies conducted at the time was that the 
higher- interest currency appreciated on aver -
age over the investment period. This is consist -
ent with the empirical results of numerous pre -
vious studies.2 The observed phenomenon is 
also related to the fact that currency carry 
trades were, on average, a profitable invest -
ment strategy as investors often received, in 
addition to the higher interest rate at which 
they invested using this strategy, a return from 
currency appreciation.3 At the beginning of the 
new millennium, the question of why the un -
covered interest parity theory could not be 
confirmed well empirically was the subject of a 
large number of theoretical and empirical 
papers.4
This report takes the scientific debate as an op -
portunity to re- examine the relationship be -
tween interest rate differentials and the ex -
change rate both theoretically and empirically. 
The main focus is on differences in return be -
tween money market investments in other cur -
rency areas and those in the euro area.5 By

3 At first glance, the result of these studies, i.e. that inter -
est rate differentials forecast excess returns, contradicts the 
assumption of rational expectations, and has been dis -
cussed in the literature as the “uncovered interest rate par -
ity puzzle” or “forward premium puzzle”. See Engel et al. 
(2022).
4 A comprehensive overview of the empirical papers on 
this topic can be found in Engel (2014). See also the above- 
mentioned article in the Monthly Report, Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2005).
5 In keeping with the relevant literature, the empirical an -
alysis is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate 
(LIBOR), which is now only calculated for the US dollar. The 
calculation was discontinued for other currencies at the 
end of 2021. The investigation period therefore ends on 
31 December 2021. Following news in 2012 of manipula -
tion in connection with the setting of reference rates, not -
ably LIBOR and EURIBOR, the global system of reference 
rates underwent fundamental reform (see Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2020)). One result was that LIBOR was initially re -
formed before being replaced by new reference rates from 
2022. For the euro area, it is to be superseded by €STR 
(euro short-  term rate), which the European Central Bank 
(ECB) only began publishing in October 2019 and is only 
available retroactively for the period up to March 2017. This 
is the reason why the empirical examination uses LIBOR 
rates for the longer-term period under review.Deutsche Bundesbank

at interest rate differentials vis- à- vis the United 
States. The report consists of two sections. It 
deals, first, with covered interest parity and 
presents various explanatory approaches for 
the observed deviations from the relationship it 
postulates. Next, it looks at uncovered interest 
parity and examines whether, using the afore -
mentioned hypothetical currency carry trade 
strategy, interest- rate speculators would still 
have been able to generate profits on average 
in recent years.
In this context, the relationship between the 
transatlantic interest rate differential and the 
euro exchange rate against the US dollar has 
been linked, amongst other things, to several 
crises that have weighed on the international 
financial markets in recent years. The first to be 
mentioned is the global financial crisis, which 
began in mid- 2007 in the US mortgage market 
and expanded into an international crisis the 
following year. Second, the sovereign debt cri -
ses in the euro area affected foreign exchange 
market developments, which first came to a 
head in October 2009 with the downgrade of 
Greek creditworthiness and then intensified 
further. Third, the global spread of the corona -
virus from the spring of 2020 onwards and the 
Russian war of aggression against Ukraine 
which began in February 2022 have been 
weighing on the global economic outlook. In 
each of the affected currency areas, the crises 
led central banks to recalibrate their monetary 
policy at different points in time and thus asym -
metrically. This was reflected in changing inter -
est rate differentials. In the academic literature, 
the interest rate differential “breathing” in this 
manner is usually cited as an important cause 
of exchange rate fluctuations.
Covered interest parity and 
euro- US dollar exchange rate
According to the covered interest parity theory, 
under the assumptions of an efficient foreign 
exchange market, the interest income from a 
US dollar investment should match that from an equivalent euro investment plus the rate of 
change of the euro expected in the forward 
market.6 This rate of change in the exchange 
rate expected in the forward market is referred 
to as the swap rate and is derived from the dif -
ference between the forward and spot quota -
tion of the euro- US dollar exchange rate based 
on the spot rate.7 As the forward rate is already 
fixed today, there is no exchange rate risk. The 
difference between euro area and US interest 
rates plus the swap rate is referred to as the 
basis or the cross- currency basis. If covered 
interest parity exists, this basis should be close 
to zero. If this is not the case, the theory sug -
gests there is a possibility of generating safe Crises with a 
potential impact 
on interest 
 parity

6 In such a formulation, it is assumed that no risk premia 
are demanded that can also be reflected in the forward 
rate. The prerequisites for an efficient foreign exchange 
market include free movement of capital, no transaction 
costs, rational actors, information efficiency and complete 
market transparency.

(arbitrage) profits from the interest rate differ -
entials. However, since safe profits should be 
excluded, deviations from covered interest par -
ity are generally a phenomenon that requires a 
specific economic explanation.
The following example is provided as an illustra -
tion. Let us assume there is an interest rate ad -
vantage for the United States. An interest rate 
arbitrageur borrows in euro at the lower interest 
rate in the euro area, exchanges the borrowed 
amount for US dollars on the spot market and 
invests it in a US dollar investment with the same 
maturity as the loan. At the same time, the arbi -
trageur hedges against the exchange rate risks 
and sells the repayment amount of the US dollar 
investment that will mature in the future against 
the euro on the forward market today. If the 
swap rate of the euro- US dollar exchange rate is 
positive when the contract is concluded, the 
euro trades more strongly on the forward mar -
ket than on the spot market (forward price pre -
mium). Under these circumstances, the arbitra -
geur accepts an exchange rate loss (that is al -
ready known to them today) when the US dollar 
investment amount is exchanged back. Where 
there is covered interest parity, this exchange 
rate loss that is associated with the hedging 
transaction more or less compensates for the US 
interest rate advantage.
However, if there is no covered interest parity 
and the exchange rate loss associated with the 
hedging transaction when the US dollar invest -
ment amount is exchanged back is smaller, for 
example, than the US interest rate advantage, 
the model states that the credit- financed US 
dollar investment will create a risk- free profit 
opportunity. The weaker the euro is in the for -
ward market, the greater the profit. By contrast, 
the credit- financed foreign investment would 
make a loss if the forward price premium for 
the euro and the resulting price hedging costs 
were greater than the interest rate differential.
Up until the onset of the global financial crisis, 
the swap rate approximately compensated for 
the differences in money market rates between the currency areas. As mentioned above, after 
taking transaction costs into account, the ob -
served deviations from covered interest parity 
pointed to data imperfections rather than to 
market inefficiencies, and were negligible, all in 
all. During the course of 2008, however, a rela -
tively large deviation emerged. In the money 
markets, US dollar interest rates based on the 
LIBOR rate fell below the corresponding inter -
est rates in the euro area without the swap rate 
simultaneously taking a negative value, thus 
compensating for the change in the interest 
rate differential.8 A deviation from covered 
interest parity arose (in this case, a negative 
dollar basis) which, with the opposite sign, cor -
responds to a positive euro basis.9
In September 2008, following the bankruptcy 
of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, a 
positive swap rate even came into effect in the 
short term, although the interest rate differen -
tial between the United States and the euro 
area remained negative. Thus, the forward ex -
change rate of the euro against the US dollar 
rose above the spot rate; the forward markets 
priced in an appreciation of the euro. An invest -
ment in the euro area was therefore doubly lu -
crative, owing both to the interest rate advan -
tage in the euro area and to the forward price 
premium of the euro. The covered interest par -
ity deviation increased and peaked at 289 basis 
points annualised in terms of three- month 
money and expressed as a euro basis. A similar 
reaction was observed during the intensification 
of the euro area sovereign debt crises in No -
vember 2011, when the euro basis rose to as 
high as an annualised 149 basis points. Al -
though it gradually decreased again until mid-  
2014, there were also longer- lasting deviations 
from covered interest parity despite relatively 
calm market phases in the time that followed.
In recent years, however, such covered interest 
parity deviations have remained comparatively An example

small. For example, the euro basis expanded 
once again as the coronavirus spread world -
wide from March 2020 onwards, but peaked at 
no higher than 75 basis points before declining 
again in the second half of March. This was 
partly due to coordinated action by the Euro -
system and the Fed as well as the central banks 
of Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan and 
Switzerland, which had agreed on additional 
measures to strengthen the provision of US 
dollar liquidity.10 This supported the euro 
against the US dollar in the spot market, redu -
cing the existing forward price premium of the 
euro and the underlying expectation of appre -
ciation.
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has 
had relatively little impact on deviations from 
the covered interest parity of the euro. Since 
February 2022, the interest rate differential be -
tween three- month LIBOR for the US dollar and 
three-  month EURIBOR has widened. This is 
largely attributable to expectations of a faster 
monetary policy normalisation in the United 
States than in the euro area, which has grown 
further in intensity on the back of the Ukraine 
war. At the same time, however, the forward 
market has experienced a positive swap rate, 
which means that the euro has been trading 
more strongly on the maturity date of the for -ward contract. As a result, the euro basis has 
hardly reacted to the war in Ukraine.
Even recently, although fragmentation risks 
have been discussed in the euro area and the 
ECB Governing Council in July 2022 approved, 
against this background, the establishment of 
an instrument to protect monetary policy trans -
mission (Transmission Protection Instrument, 
TPI),11 the euro basis has remained at a com -
paratively low level.12… but relatively

10 As part of this coordinated move, it was agreed that in 
order to enhance the provision of US dollar liquidity, US 
dollar swaps with a seven- day maturity would no longer be 
offered only weekly, as hitherto, but on a daily basis. This 
evidently alleviated market participants’ concerns regarding 
providing the banking system with US dollar liquidity and 
the prospect of a shortage of US currency. The hitherto 
negative dollar basis of the euro, the yen and the Swiss 
franc, which is an indicator of tension in the foreign ex -
change market, subsequently declined rapidly and the high 
level of exchange rate volatility fell markedly. The measure 
therefore helped calm the market.

will be able to make secondary market purchases of secur -
ities issued in jurisdictions experiencing a deterioration in 
financing conditions not warranted by country- specific fun -
damentals, to counter risks to the transmission mechanism 
to the extent necessary.” See European Central Bank 
(2022).
12 EURIBOR has been used to calculate the euro basis as of 
2022 because LIBOR values for the euro were no longer 
made available after 31 December 2021. In the past, the 
three- month EURIBOR for the euro was closely correlated 
with LIBOR. A comparison with the aforementioned crises 
is therefore generally possible, but should be interpreted 
with caution, subject to differences in datasets.Deutsche Bundesbank

On the interpretation of the dollar or euro basis
According to the covered interest parity 
theory, the returns on a domestic invest-
ment and a foreign investment hedged by a 
forward transaction are equal. International 
interest rate differentials on the money 
market are thus roughly offset by the swap 
rate, i.e. the percentage deviation of the 
forward rate from the current spot rate in 
relation to this spot rate. If this is not the 
case, there are risk- free profi  t opportunities 
(if transaction costs are disregarded), which 
would theoretically be directly reduced by 
interest rate arbitrage. Where it denotes the

In contrast to theory, however, longer- 
lasting deviations from covered interest par-
ity have been observed empirically since 
2007. In the extensive literature on this 
topic, this deviation is generally referred to 
as a basis, or more specifi  cally the cross- 
currency basis. The cross- currency basis is a 
dimensionless variable expressed in per-
centage points. How it is formulated de-
pends on the choice of reference currency. 
The literature mostly looks at the cross- 
currency basis of the US dollar. If the part-
ner currency is the euro, the cross- currency 
basis of the US dollar (the dollar basis) can 
be written as follows:(2) dollar basiseuro

The exchange rate weuro is defi  ned here in 
units of US dollar per euro.2 The academic 
literature on this topic focuses in particular 
on the frequently observed phenomenon of 
a negative dollar basis. The dollar basis can 
be interpreted as the difference between 
direct US dollar fi  nancing and “synthetic” 
US dollar fi  nancing.3 The difference be-
tween these two fi  nancing options played a 
role in the fi  nancial crisis, when foreign 
commercial banks were no longer able 
to  directly refinance their US dollar- 
 denominated liabilities via US dollar loans in 
1 The no- arbitrage condition can be derived as fol-
lows: an interest rate arbitrageur receives a safe return 
of (1+i ) for a certain investment amount A expressed 
in domestic currency and invested domestically. If, in-
stead, the arbitrageur were to invest investment 
amount A abroad, they would fi  rst have to convert it 
into foreign currency units on the spot market. The re-
turn on the alternative foreign investment in foreign 
currency is therefore [(1+i*)·wK
t] A. It is assumed that 
the interest rate arbitrageur hedges against exchange 
rate risks on the forward market; they sell the income 
from foreign investment expressed in foreign currency 
at t in a forward transaction t +k at the forward ex-
change rate 1 /wT
t,t+k for domestic currency and receive 
[(1+i*)·wK
t/wT
t,t+k] A. The risk- neutral interest rate arbi-
trageur is indifferent to investing domestically versus 
investing abroad if the yields from the investments are 
equal. This condition is met if (1+i ) A = [(1+i*) · wK

3 A negative dollar basis means the cost of direct US 
dollar fi  nancing is lower than the cost of synthetic US 
dollar fi  nancing. At the same time, from the perspec-
tive of an investor from the United States, the yield on 
a money market investment in the euro area is higher 
than that on a comparable investment in the United 
States.Deutsche Bundesbank

the US interbank market (direct US dollar 
fi  nancing).4 Instead, they relied on synthetic 
fi  nancing. This is where a loan is taken out 
in a currency other than the US dollar, i.e. in 
euro, for example, and then exchanged for 
US dollars. At the time of transaction t, the 
loan amount denominated in euro is sold 
against US dollars using a swap transaction 
at the then- valid spot rate weuro K and at the 
same time bought back at the forward ex-
change rate weuro T agreed today for the end 
of the term t+k. The dollar basis of the euro 
as the difference between the money mar-
ket rates in the United States, idollar, and the 
sum of the money market rate in the euro 
area, ieuro, and the swap rate exactly corres-
ponds to the difference between the two 
types of fi  nancing described. The cost of 
synthetic dollar fi  nancing is higher than the 
euro interest rate, ieuro, only if the forward 
exchange rate of the euro is traded at a 
mark- up against the spot price, i.e. where 
weuro T > weuro K. A negative dollar basis im-
plies that the cost of direct US dollar fi  nan-
cing is lower than the cost of synthetic US 
dollar fi  nancing. At the same time, from the 
perspective of an investor from the United 
States, the yield on a money market invest-
ment in the United States is lower than that 
of a comparable investment in the single 
currency area.

of the dollar basis. The euro basis corres-
ponds exactly to the US dollar basis with

tTransaction costs have not been taken into 
account in previous analyses of the cross- 
currency basis. The equations assume that it 
is possible to buy and sell at the same rate. 
In fact, however, two rates are usually 
quoted in the fi  nancial markets. First, the 
bid rate, i.e. the price at which a currency 
can be sold from an arbitrageur’s perspec-
tive. Second, the ask rate, at which it can 
be purchased from an arbitrageur’s per-
spective. The bid rate is, in this case, below 
the ask rate.6 In the case of synthetic euro 
fi  nancing, which an interest rate arbitrageur 
would use when the euro basis is positive, 
the relevant factors are the euro ask rate 
(purchase of euro today, i.e. at t ) for the 
spot transaction described above and the 
euro bid rate (sale of euro at the forward 
rate known today, i.e. at t, at time t+k ) for 
the forward transaction.7 If the conditional 
equation for the cross- currency basis of the 
euro (3) is corrected by the transaction costs 
resulting from the bid- ask spread, the fol-
4 See also pp. 56.
5 If the euro basis is positive, the cost of direct euro 
fi  nancing is higher than the cost of synthetic euro 
fi  nancing.
6 From an arbitrageur’s perspective, under these cir-
cumstances, buying and selling the euro at the same 
time entails a loss that usually represents the transac-
tion costs.
7 In the case of synthetic euro fi  nancing, a US dollar 
loan is taken out in the US money market at the fa-
vourable US interest rate itdollar. The US dollar loan 
amount is exchanged for euro on the spot market. This 
means that the arbitrageur purchases euro today, i.e. 
at t, on the spot market at the ask rate w (ask)teuro K. In 
order to be able to repay the US dollar loan amount at 
maturity t+k, without exchange rate risks, the arbitra-
geur sells the euro amount set to be freed up at t+k in 
a forward transaction at the bid rate w (bid)t,t+k   euro T

correction factor!
As the correction factor of synthetic euro 
fi  nancing is positive,10 the costs of synthetic 
euro fi  nancing on the basis of the actual bid 
and ask rates are higher than those shown 
in the (uncorrected) cross- currency basis. 
The positive, unadjusted euro basis is there-
fore reported as too high.11
Transaction costs, which are refl  ected in 
bid- ask spreads, mean that the uncorrected 
cross- currency basis overestimates arbitrage 
opportunities. A necessary but insuffi   cient 
condition for arbitrage is that the uncor-
rected cross- currency basis is higher in 
terms of value than the transaction costs 
captured in the correction factor. This was 
indeed the case when the euro basis ex-
panded markedly against the US dollar dur-
ing the crises and between 2015 and 2020. The observed deviations from covered inter-
est parity can therefore only be explained to 
a small extent by the bid- ask spread.
8 The correction consists of replacing the swap rate on 
the basis of mid- market rates with the swap rate on 
the basis of euro ask- spot and bid- forward rates. The 
euro basis (equation (3)) is thus: euro basistdollar = iteuro 
– itdollar + (w(bid)t,t+k  euro T – w(ask)teuro K)/ w(ask)teuro K. Refor-
mulation produces: euro basistdollar = iteuro – itdollar + 
(w(bid)t,t+k  euro T/ w(ask)teuro K – 1). 1 can be replaced by the 
expression – (wt,t+k  euro T – wteuro K)/wteuro K + wt,t+k  euro T/wteuro K. 
Taking into account the relevant bid and ask rates, the 
euro basis is therefore: euro basistdollar = iteuro – itdollar + 
w(bid)t,t+k  euro T/ w(ask)teuro K + (wt,t+k  euro T – wteuro K)/wteuro K – 
wt,t+k  euro T/wteuro K. Finally, reformulation produces equa-
tion (4). For information on the importance of the 
spread between bid and ask rates in the event of devi-
ations from covered interest parity due to a decline in 
market liquidity, see Borio et al. (2016b), pp. 48-49.
9 If the euro basis were negative, the foreign ex-
change trader would, by contrast, sell euro on the spot 
market and buy it back on the forward market. In 
these circumstances, the selling price of the euro (bid 
rate) would be relevant for spot transactions and the 
purchase price of the euro (ask rate) would be relevant 
for forward transactions.
10 The correction item is positive because the mid- 
market rate (w ) is lower than the ask rate and higher 
than the bid rate.
11 The bid and ask rates differ for money market in-
struments, too, although this is not taken into account 
in the above equation. If these transaction costs were 
also taken into account, the correction factor would 
be even greater.Euro basis and transaction costs

Causes of uncovered interest 
parity deviations
Risk premia, the resulting liquidity bottlenecks 
in foreign currencies, additional regulatory pro -
visions for banks and unilateral monetary policy 
easing measures are cited in the academic lit -
erature as possible causes of a violation of 
covered interest parity. The aforementioned 
reasons either contribute to a shift in the de -
mand for exchange rate hedging13 or to a re -
duction in arbitrage opportunities.
In times of crisis, investors often weight their 
portfolios more heavily in favour of US dollar-  
denominated securities because these invest -
ments are considered to be particularly safe. As 
a result, the euro and other major currencies 
frequently trade weaker against the US dollar 
on the spot market.14 Empirical evidence shows 
that a positive euro basis can build up in such 
times. This is because, in these cases, risk and 
market players’ aversion to risk increase so 
sharply that trading activity, which could ex -
ploit profit opportunities, decreases or even 
dries up completely.
This is mainly due to credit risk. With covered 
interest arbitrage, arbitrageurs do hedge 
against exchange rate risk. However, the risk of 
a counterparty defaulting is not covered. In 
such a case, the profit opportunities resulting 
from a covered interest parity deviation are 
therefore not risk- free. If interest rate arbitra -
geurs are risk- averse and institutions in the dif -
ferent currency areas are affected by a default 
risk to varying degrees, the relatively safer 
counterparty demands a premium for assum -
ing the relative counterparty risk. This premium 
is likely to be high, especially in times of crisis, 
and it is reflected in a deviation from covered 
interest parity. The amount of the premium is 
influenced, in particular, by market participants’ 
attitude to risk and the level of the assumed 
relative counterparty risk.
The relevant literature often uses the Cboe 
Volatility Index (VIX) of the S&P 500 stock index as an important measure of general risk appe -
tite in the financial markets.15 A more specific 
measure of counterparty risk is the LIBOR- OIS 
spread. Unlike LIBOR, the rate at which banks 
provide each other with unsecured loans on 
average, the overnight index swap (OIS) in -
volves only the difference between the interest 
payments owed to each other being ex -
changed. The OIS therefore entails a compara -
tively low credit risk. For this reason, the litera -
ture uses the LIBOR- OIS spread for the euro to 
approximate the systemic risk of euro area 
counterparties defaulting.16 Empirically, it can 
be observed that, especially in times of crisis, The US dollar

the VIX and LIBOR- OIS spreads have a positive 
relationship with the euro basis against the US 
dollar. All three variables often rise markedly in 
times of financial turmoil.17
Our own econometric estimates point to the 
importance of relative counterparty risk in the 
banking sector when explaining the euro basis 
against the US dollar.18 They show that invest -
ors taking counterparty risk into consideration 
when financial markets are strained can be one 
reason for the covered interest parity deviations 
that have been identified.
As a result of the sharp loss of confidence in 
the interbank sector from mid-  September 2008 
onwards, some players apparently withdrew 
from those markets that are important for 
interest rate arbitrage during this period. A US 
dollar shortage ensued in the sense that Euro -
pean banks were no longer able to refinance 
their US dollar- denominated loans – raised, for 
example, to invest in the US mortgage mar -ket – through the US interbank market. Since 
dollar financing through US commercial banks 
almost came to a standstill at that time, Euro -
pean banks began to finance their dollar liabil -
ities indirectly by entering a swap. To do so, 
they were able to obtain euro loans from the 
Eurosystem, which they transferred in US dol -
lars via a foreign exchange swap with other 
commercial banks. This increased demand for 
foreign exchange swaps, where euros were 
sold against US dollars on the spot market and 
bought back in a forward transaction. As de -
mand for foreign exchange swaps was largely 
one- sided because US banks were not willing 
to offer the necessary offsetting transactions at 
the given exchange rates owing to the high 
perceived counterparty risk, a forward price 
premium for the euro built up.19 This resulted in 
the aforementioned covered interest parity de -
viations of up to 289 basis points, which repre -
sented a significant increase in the price of in -
direct dollar financing.
The establishment of unlimited US dollar swap 
lines between the Fed and the ECB as well as 
other central banks as of 13  October 2008 
made it possible for banks outside the United 
States to obtain US dollar funding via their na -

19 See Baba and Packer (2009). The study concludes that, 
after the onset of the financial market turmoil, swap rates 
reflected relative counterparty risks in the period from 
9  August 2007 to 12  September 2008. In addition, it 
comes to the conclusion that “[a]fter the failure of Lehman 
Brothers in September 2008, deviations from covered 
interest parity (CIP) were negatively associated with the 
creditworthiness of US financial institutions (as well as that 
of European institutions), consistent with the deepening of 
a dollar liquidity problem into a global phenomenon. US 
dollar term funding auctions by the ECB, SNB, and BoE, as 
well as the US Federal Reserve commitment to provide un -
limited dollar swap lines are found to have ameliorated the 
FX swap market dislocations.” For data availability reasons, 
the sample period of our own econometric study does not 
begin until October 2008, meaning that the effect of the 
US dollar shortage, which pushed the euro basis against 
the US dollar to a record level at the end of September and 
was eliminated by the unlimited swap lines in mid- October, 
plays only a minor role.Deutsche Bundesbank

Empirically testing the validity of uncovered and covered 
interest parity
The validity of uncovered and covered inter-
est parity can be tested using econometric 
methods.1 The estimations for different 
periods and currency pairs presented below 
are based on data for the period from the 
beginning of 1999 to the end of 2021.2
Uncovered interest parity
To test the validity of uncovered interest 
parity between the euro area and four other 
currency areas, the United States (US), the 
United Kingdom (UK), Japan (JP) and Switz-
erland (CH), the econometric equation
ln(wK
t+k)ln(wK
t)=↵0+↵1(i⇤
k,tik,t)+" t+k
is estimated for the respective currency 
pairs using the least squares estimator.
Here, wtK denotes the spot rate in quantity 
quotation (units of foreign currency per 
euro) at time t , wK
t+k the same rate at time 
t+k, ik,t the interest rate on three- month 
money market funds in the euro area and 
i⇤
k,t the same rate abroad (US, UK, JP and 
CH). Since the interest instruments have a 
maturity of three months, the exchange rate 
change is calculated over the same period.3 
The parameter k  is set to 90 calendar days.4 
In order to avoid inherent overlaps in the 
dependent variables resulting from the use 
of daily data, only the respective end- of- 
quarter values are used in the estimations. 
The estimation results are consistent with 
uncovered interest parity if the common null 
hypothesis α0/uni00A0=/uni00A00 and α1/uni00A0=/uni00A01 is not re-
jected at a given signifi  cance level.
The following compares results for three 
different samples: the fi  rst runs from the es-
tablishment of monetary union (the fi  rst quarter of 1999) up to but not including the 
outbreak of the fi  nancial crisis (the fi  rst 
quarter of 2007),5 the second runs from the 
outbreak of the global fi  nancial crisis (the 
third quarter of 2007) to the fourth quarter 
of 2021, and the third covers both samples, 
i.e. the fi  rst quarter of 1999 to the fourth 
quarter of 2021. The full sample was sub-
divided in order to see whether the rela-
tionship between the exchange rate change 
and the interest rate differential might have 
altered.
The table on p. 58 shows the estimation re-
sults for the various samples and currency 
areas. It includes the point estimates for the 
constant α0 and the slope coeffi   cient α1, 
their individual statistical signifi  cance and 
also the results of an F- test, which is used 
to test the validity of the aforementioned 
null hypothesis implied by uncovered inter-
est parity.
While the validity of uncovered interest rate 
parity for the pre global fi  nancial crisis sam-
ple must be rejected at a 5% signifi  cance 
level for all four currency pairs, its validity in 
the post global fi  nancial crisis sample is 
now rejected at the same signifi  cance level

of the econometric methods presented, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2005).

3 As the interest rate on three- month money market 
funds is expressed as a percentage per annum, the de-
pendent variable has been multiplied by a factor of 
400 so that the rate of change is also expressed as a 
percentage per annum.
4 If no value is available for the exchange rate at either 
time t or time t +90, the corresponding observations 
are excluded from the estimations.
5 As the value of the exchange rate from the following 
quarter is used in the calculation of the dependent 
variables, this sample already ends two quarters before 
the outbreak of the fi  nancial crisis.Deutsche Bundesbank

only for the yen.6 These results should be 
interpreted with caution due to relatively 
low estimation accuracy and unstable par-
ameter values.7 It is noticeable, however, 
that the estimated slope coeffi   cients in the 
more recent sample are signifi  cantly higher 
than those in the pre fi  nancial crisis sample 
and now all have a positive sign; in the earl-
ier sample, their signs were still consistently 
estimated to be negative. The results imply 
that since the global fi  nancial crisis – in con-
trast to beforehand – it has tended to be 
the currency in which the higher- interest in-
vestment is denominated that depreciates 
over the investment period. Despite the low 
estimation accuracy, it can therefore be 
concluded that the empirical evidence for 
the post fi  nancial crisis sample –  when 
taken as a whole – is more in line with un-
covered interest parity than is the case for 
the earlier sample running from the estab-
lishment of European monetary union to 
the outbreak of the fi  nancial crisis.
Covered interest parity
The following econometric equation (which 
is broadly similar to the above approach) is 
estimated in order to test the validity of 
covered interest parity:ln(wT
t,t+k)ln(wK
t)=0+1(i⇤
k,t–ik,t)+v t
This estimation uses all available daily data 
and not just the end- of- quarter values, as 
the forward rate wT
t,t+k (unlike the exchange 
rate 90 calendar days later) is already 
known at time t, meaning that no informa-
tion is included in the estimation that is not 
yet available at time t.8 Newey- West stand-
ard errors are again used to control for 
auto correlated residuals. If the common 
null hypothesis β0 = 0 and β1 = 1 cannot be 
rejected, this indicates the validity of 
covered interest parity.
Based on the results of the F- tests, covered 
interest parity is clearly rejected for both the 
pre and post fi  nancial crisis samples. This 
may come as a surprise initially, given that 
6 If a signifi  cance level of 10% is assumed, the validity 
of uncovered interest parity must be rejected in the 
more recent sample for the pound sterling as well.
7 The low estimation accuracy is revealed in the large 
(in absolute terms) standard errors. Rolling estimations 
point to a comparatively high degree of instability in 
the parameters, including within the respective sam-
ples.
8 In order for the dependent variable (forward price 
premium) to be expressed as a percentage per annum 
like the explanatory variable (international interest rate 
differential of three- month money market funds), the 
former was multiplied again by a factor of 400 before 
the estimations were carried out.Estimation results for uncovered interest parity*

the point estimates – when compared with 
those for uncovered interest parity  – are 
very close to the postulated values for the 
parameters. However, the estimation accur-
acy is much higher for these estimations 
than for the estimations of uncovered inter-
est parity, which increases the discrimin-
atory power of the tests and leads to the 
null hypothesis being rejected if the esti-
mated coeffi   cients deviate even slightly 
from the postulated values. Notwithstand-
ing the qualitatively unchanged test results, 
these fi  gures show that the estimated val-
ues –  in particular for the slope coeffi   -
cients – for the post global fi  nancial crisis 
sample and for every currency pair differ 
much more than before from the values 
that are in line with covered interest parity.
Therefore, a further simple econometric an-
alysis was conducted to examine the im-
pact of some of the explanatory variables 
described in this article on the euro basis 
against the US dollar, which denotes the 
difference between euro area and US 
money market rates plus the euro- US dollar 
swap rate.9 The analysis is complicated by 
the fact that data are not available for all 
explanatory variables over the full sample 
and that some of the various explanatory variables are themselves closely empirically 
related. Both factors infl  uence the statistical 
inference. The estimated econometric 
model is:

The explanatory variables are the LIBOR- OIS 
spreads in the euro area and the United 
States, the IOER- LIBOR spreads in the two 
currency areas and a Basel III dummy.10 As 
shown on pp. 56/57 and 62, the LIBOR- OIS 
spreads are intended to approximate coun-
9 For reasons of consistency with the previous estima-
tions, the euro basis was also calculated in the follow-
ing empirical analysis on the basis of the logarithmic 
forward and spot exchange rates. However, this has 
little impact on the estimation results.
10 In the literature, such equations are usually esti-
mated in fi  rst differences, as often the non- stationarity 
of the basis cannot be rejected. However, as this is not 
the case for the currency pair and three- month matur-
ity examined here, the estimation can be conducted 
with data in levels. This approach is also consistent 
with Borio et al. (2018), according to which the basis 
for three- month money market funds is stationary, 
whereas in the case of longer maturities it is usually 
necessary to assume non- stationarity. Nevertheless, 
this series also shows some persistence.Estimation results for covered interest parity*

terparty risk and the IOER- LIBOR spreads 
are intended to approximate the minimum 
limit for the cost of equity in the respective 
currency areas. IOER (interest rate on excess 
reserves) is the interest rate paid to com-
mercial banks for excess reserves at the 
central bank. The Basel III dummy has a 
value of 1 as of 2015, before which it is 
equal to 0. This is a simple way of control-
ling for regulatory changes in connection 
with the implementation of the Basel III de-
cisions.11
The estimated coeffi   cients in the above 
table all show the expected signs.12 How-
ever, only the coeffi   cients of the LIBOR- OIS 
spreads and those of the Basel III dummy 
are also statistically signifi  cant. The insignifi  -
cance of the other parameters could, how-
ever, be due to the high correlation be-
tween the corresponding variables and the 
spread variables already contained in the 
model.13 The econometric estimates iden-
tify relative systemic counterparty risk in 
particular as an important factor in explain-
ing the euro basis against the US dollar. In 
addition, they suggest that the stricter regu-
latory rules in the banking sector also have an impact on the level of deviations from 
covered interest parity.14
11 See also Du et al. (2018), in which an equivalently 
coded dummy variable is used to model the potential 
effect on the dollar basis of the introduction in 2015 of 
the leverage ratio. Its statistical signifi  cance supports 
the hypothesis that the leverage ratio introduced in 
2015 is a factor in arbitrage considerations.
12 Interest rate spreads have been added to the model 
separately for both currency areas and not in relation 
to each other, as it is not necessarily possible to as-
sume that the euro basis against the US dollar will re-
spond symmetrically to changes in the corresponding 
variables in the United States and the euro area.
13 Adding more explanatory variables, such as the VIX 
volatility index, would further exacerbate the multicol-
linearity problem, as this variable and the LIBOR- OIS 
spreads are likewise closely linearly related.
14 The marginal signifi  cance level of the Basel III indi-
cator variable is 0.06. It is thus slightly above the 5% 
signifi  cance level but clearly below the 10% signifi  -
cance level.Estimation results for the euro basis

As a result, the US dollar shortage and, in turn,

less able to explain why, since the end of 2014, 
there have been repeated instances of notice -
able and persistent deviations from covered 
interest parity, including in periods of market 
calm. Researchers from the Bank for Inter -
national Settlements (BIS) provide a possible 
explanation.23 According to their studies, two 
necessary conditions must be met for such de -
viations to occur outside times of crisis. First, 
there needs to be imbalanced and relatively 
price- inelastic demand for hedging FX risk – for 
example, FX hedging demand for US dollars 
against the euro. In this example, this led to 
market pressure towards a positive euro basis. 
Second, there must be reasons why seemingly 
risk- free arbitrage does not occur as soon as 
the basis begins to widen.
According to the studies mentioned, the rela -
tively price- inelastic demand for hedging from 
the various market participants is key to a posi -
tive basis in terms of size. Thus, banks demand 
foreign exchange swaps to hedge a currency 
mismatch on their balance sheets. Such mis -
matches can arise, for example, if a substantial 
portion of their deposits are denominated in a 
bank’s domestic currency, e.g. euro, but its ex -
posures are denominated at least partially in 
foreign currency, e.g. US dollars. Institutional 
investors like insurers and pension funds, mean -
while, hedge a portion of their international ex -
posures against exchange rate risks using for -
ward contracts.24 Non-  financial corporations 
also demand forward contracts to hedge 
against exchange rate fluctuations, for in -
stance.
Before looking more closely at the supply-  side 
reasons why seemingly available arbitrage op -portunities are left untaken, this article first 
examines whether the demand- side condition 
for the existence of a positive and relatively 
persistent euro basis against the US dollar since 
the end of 2014 has been met. The unilateral 
monetary easing in the euro area and the asso -
ciated increase in the interest rate differential 
are indeed likely to have contributed to an im -
balance in the demand for foreign exchange 
swaps.25 Hence, the difference in return prob -
ably prompted euro area investors to invest 
more money in the United States, while at least 
partially hedging the resulting exchange rate 
risks.
At the same time, the empirical evidence sug -
gests that US firms stepped up their issuance of 
euro- denominated bonds. Thus, issuance vol -
umes of euro- denominated US corporate 
bonds (reverse yankees) rose markedly be -
tween 2015 and 2018, for instance, even 
though hedging costs were high. Brophy et al. 
(2019) find that quantitative easing in the euro 
area significantly lowered credit risk premia in 
euro area bond markets. For some US firms, 
this reportedly made issuance in euro bond 
markets more attractive than in US dollar bond 
markets,26 while the hedging of the associated Significant and

20 On 13 October 2008, the Bank of England, the Bank of 
Japan, the ECB, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National 
Bank announced joint measures to improve liquidity in 
short- term US dollar funding markets. These were tenders 
of US dollar funding at 7- day, 28- day and 84- day matur -
ities at fixed interest rates for full allotment. In order to ac -
commodate whatever quantity of US dollar funding is de -
manded, unlimited US dollar swap lines were introduced 
between the Federal Reserve and the three aforemen -
tioned European central banks. See Federal Reserve (2008).
21 See European Central Bank (2016) .
22 For more information on the effectiveness of the US 
dollar swap lines, see Bahaj and Reis (2022), who use an 
empirical study to demonstrate that the swap lines put a 
ceiling on deviations from covered interest parity.
23 See Borio et al. (2016a, 2016b, 2018).
24 Borio et al. (2018) cite findings by Barclays (2015), 
which find that Japanese insurers hedge around 60% to 
70% of their exchange rate risk, while Japanese pension 
funds did not transact any such hedging for the foreign 
currency- denominated bonds in their portfolios.
25 Borio et al. (2016b) refer in this context to divergent 
monetary policies in an ultra- low interest rate environment.

currency positions contributed to an increase in 
the swap rate over and above the US interest 
rate advantage. On balance, the authors note, 
the violation of covered interest parity had 
been exacerbated by the increasing issuance of 
reverse yankees. Both effects thus had a unilat -
eral supportive impact on demand and gener -
ated the aforementioned pressure from the de -
mand side. Both euro area investors investing 
in the United States and US firms issuing euro- 
denominated bonds hedged against a depreci -
ation of the US dollar against the euro.
On the supply side, the BIS’s studies refer to 
regulatory adjustments and a change in banks’ 
risk management practices which, in combin -
ation, make it costly to expand the balance 
sheet, thus inhibiting arbitrage.27 The BIS found 
that the balance sheet expansion associated 
with arbitrage called for the provision of rela -
tively high- yielding capital once it exceeded a 
certain limit. If the euro basis only just offsets 
the cost of capital or is even less than that, ar -
bitrage is not worthwhile. Consistent with this 
approach, there is no return equalisation below 
the floor represented by the cost of equity as -
sociated with the arbitrage trade. Hence, the 
euro basis does not close.28
The Basel III decisions are cited in connection 
with the rising cost of interest rate arbitrage 
owing to a tightening of the capital rules. 
These decisions were announced in December 
2010 and envisaged the phasing-  in of add -
itional regulatory requirements for banks be -
tween 2013 and 2019.29 The reform package 
saw the Basel Committee learn the lessons 
from the financial crisis, in particular by 
strengthening the resilience of the banking sec -
tor by improving the regulatory capital base in 
qualitative and quantitative terms.
Thus, according to these decisions, the min -
imum capital requirement – i.e. the prescribed 
minimum ratio between regulatory capital and 
risk- weighted assets – has been supplemented 
by various capital buffers. These buffers were 
phased in between 2016 and 2019.30 In add -ition to stricter quantitative requirements, 
higher standards have also been set for the 
quality of equity capital. Thus, the minimum 
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was raised by a 
total of 2.5  percentage points to 4.5% be -
tween 2012 and 2015.31 Banks are thus re -
quired to hold more capital of a higher quality 
against their risk- weighted assets. This gives 
banks greater scope to absorb going concern 
losses, but it also drives up the cost of risk-  
weighted assets and thus tightens limits to ar -
bitrage.
At the same time, the regulatory requirements 
were increased to give greater consideration to 
risk and tighten the calculation of risk- weighted 
assets. This made it less easy to achieve the Interest rate 
arbitrage more 
costly due to 
regulatory 
adjustments, …

of the Basel III 
decisions …

28 For the calculation of the floor, see Du et al. (2018).
29 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2011) and Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision (2010).
30 The revision of the regulatory definition of capital and 
the introduction of new minimum requirements are dis -
cussed in Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), p. 11 and p. 19.
31 The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio expresses Common 
Equity Tier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-  weighted 
assets. The components of Common Equity Tier 1 capital 
are presented in Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), p. 11. Over -
all, the stricter regulatory requirements under Basel III result 
in additional costs for interest rate arbitrage that cannot be 
recorded directly. Du et al. (2018) use the positive differ -
ence between the interest rate on excess reserves at the 
Fed (IOER) and the US LIBOR rate/federal funds rate as a 
proxy floor for the cost of capital at US banks. This is based 
on the notion that “… [in] the absence of balance sheet 
costs, banks should borrow at the federal funds rate/ U. S. 
LIBOR rate and invest risk- free at the IOER, until the federal 
funds rate/ LIBOR rate increases and both rates are equal”. 
Capital costs are also incurred in cases where the positive 
euro basis is used to borrow at favourable interest rates in 
the United States and invest the principal in the euro area. 
The assumed profits need to be adjusted for the cost of 
capital associated with the investment. If the computed de -
viations in covered interest parity are adjusted using the 
aforementioned proxy constructed by Du et al. (2018) for a 
floor on capital costs at US banks, the hypothetical arbi -
trage profits of the euro basis against the US dollar are, ac -
cording to own calculations, around 40% lower on aver -
age for the period from 1 January 2015 to 30 December 
2018. According to the calculations of Du et al. (2018), the 
hypothetical arbitrage profits of a negative dollar basis 
against the Swiss franc, the Danish krone, the euro and the 
yen decline by around 33% on average between 1 January 
2009 and 15 September 2016. The calculations suggest 
that the deviations in the basis from covered interest parity 
since the Basel III decisions came into force can probably 
mainly be attributed to the cost of capital backing, espe -
cially as the correction represents merely the estimated cost 
floor.Deutsche Bundesbank

prescribed Tier 1 capital ratio.32 To limit a bank’s 
leverage not only relative to its risk- weighted 
assets, which are usually based on model as -
sumptions, but in general, a leverage ratio was 
additionally introduced at a general Tier 1 cap -
ital ratio of 3% of a bank’s total exposures.33 
Although the leverage ratio must be complied 
with at all times, it only needs to be disclosed 
at the end of each quarter. This means that 
swaps with terms of less than three months are 
initially only reported on the quarterly balance 
sheet if they have not yet expired at the end of 
the quarter.
One indication of the relevance of the leverage 
ratio introduced by supervisors is that quarter- 
end dates since 2015 have seen a marked in -
crease, with numerous deviations from covered 
interest parity being calculated for a one- week 
or one- month investment period. As the lever -
age ratio is calculated at a certain point in time 
in the EU and reported to supervisors on the 
basis of quarter- end levels, banks may have de -
sisted from undertaking swap transactions at 
the end of the quarter in order to report higher 
leverage ratios and save capital costs.34
A further rule under the Basel III decisions is de -
signed to safeguard bank liquidity. The financial 
crisis saw a decline in trading activity in secured 
and unsecured money markets – as exemplified 
by the US dollar shortage – which led to liquid -
ity bottlenecks in the banking sector and meant 
that short- term funding was no longer assured 
in some cases. To keep liquidity risk in check, 
measures aimed at safeguarding bank liquidity 
were adopted as part of the Basel III regime. 
Since January 2015, commercial banks have 
been required to meet a minimum liquidity cov -
erage ratio (LCR), which was phased in incre -
mentally.35 This requirement is intended to en -
sure that a bank has an adequate stock of un -
encumbered high- quality liquid assets (HQLA) 
to meet its liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day 
liquidity stress scenario.36 This rule meant that Empirical

32 Overall, the denominator in the Tier 1 capital ratio has 
increased because greater consideration is given to risk. 
Thus capital has to be set aside for over- the- counter (OTC) 
derivatives such as foreign exchange swaps to cover the 
risk of a deterioration in the derivative counterparty’s credit 
quality. Potential risk under stressed conditions is another 
factor that is accounted for. Thus, all institutions that have 
supervisory approval to use their own market risk models 
must additionally calculate a risk amount that estimates the 
expected change in value in the current portfolio in a 
stressed market situation. The idea behind this rule is for 
the denominator to also include those assets which were 
classified as safe under the previous trading book rules but 
are nonetheless a source of risk in the event of systemic 
tension.
33 The leverage ratio was initially introduced purely as an 
observation ratio before becoming a binding minimum re -
quirement in January 2018. This ratio expresses a bank’s 
Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the sum of its assets and 
off- balance sheet items, with the risks associated with an 
item being given as little consideration as possible.
34 See Abbassi and Bräuning (2021). The Basel Committee 
issued a statement (2018) in response to such leverage 
ratio window- dressing behaviour, stressing that such be -
haviour is unacceptable and that the leverage ratio should 
be complied with not only at the end of the quarter but on 
an ongoing basis. The BIS notes in this statement (2018) 
that window dressing, in the form of temporary reductions 
of transaction volumes with a view to lowering the lever -
age ratio, runs counter to the aim of sustainably reducing 
the vulnerability of the banking sector to crises. The incen -
tive to engage in window dressing can be mitigated by 
switching from quarter- end levels to quarterly averages. In 
the European Union, however, it was decided that the dis -
closure and reporting of average leverage ratios should be 
limited to “large institutions” (Article 451(2) of EU Regula -
tion No 575/  2013). The detailed reporting and disclosure 
rules were implemented in two Implementing Technical 
Standards that only entered into force in 2021.
35 Introduced as at 1 January 2015, the LCR is defined as 
the ratio of the stock of HQLA and net cash outflows over 
the next 30 days. The term “total net cash outflows” is de -
fined as the total expected cash outflows minus total ex -
pected cash inflows in the specified stress scenario for the 
subsequent 30 calendar days. The minimum requirement 
was set at 60% in 2015 and rose in equal 10 percentage 
point annual steps to reach 100% in 2019. The rules are 
outlined in Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(2013), pp. 2-45.

the potential profits from arbitrage were lower 
than they would have been, had they been cal -
culated using LIBOR rates.
To illustrate how these factors interact, let us 
assume that US banks (via their branches in the 
euro area) are able to use the Eurosystem’s de -
posit facility and, for liquidity reasons, prefer to 
make a higher- interest investment in the pri -
vate money market.37 Under these circum -
stances, the arbitrage profits available in theory 
should be calculated not using the euro LIBOR 
but the rate on the Eurosystem deposit facility 
(for the three- month investment period under 
consideration), as in Rime et al. (2019).38 As the 
Eurosystem deposit facility rate has been below 
the euro LIBOR over extended periods since 
2015, the authors conclude that the opportun -
ities for reaping arbitrage profits that would ap -
pear to exist when calculated based on LIBOR 
rates either did not exist at all or did not exist in 
the magnitude shown.
It may be concluded overall that important 
conditions for interest rate arbitrage – condi -
tions that had previously kept deviations from 
covered interest parity to a minimum – have no 
longer been met since the financial crisis.
Uncovered interest parity 
and euro- US dollar exchange 
rate
If investors attempt to capitalise on inter -
national interest rate differentials even without 
hedging, their realised profits will largely de -
pend on how the spot rate evolves. Thus, for 
example, an investment in the United States, 
from a domestic investor’s perspective, was 
more lucrative with hindsight than an invest -
ment in the euro area if a given US interest rate 
advantage was not cancelled out or was in fact 
more than offset by an appreciation of the 
euro. Since it is not known at the time of in -
vestment how exchange rates will develop in 
future, the investor’s investment decision is de -
termined not only by the interest rate differen -tial but also by the expected exchange rate 
change. According to the uncovered interest 
parity theory, in the absence of capital controls 
and given the complete substitutability of in -
vestment alternatives, risk- neutral investors 
will, in the example described above, shift their 
portfolio into US investments as long as the US 
interest rate advantage is not eroded by an ex -
pected appreciation of the euro against the US 
dollar. This reallocation has two effects. First, it 
narrows the interest rate differential. Second, 
the capital exports to the United States result -
ing from said reallocation put downward pres -
sure on the euro’s exchange rate against the 
US dollar, all other things being equal. The the -
ory assumes that, given unchanged fundamen -
tals, the exchange rate expected when the in -
vestment is unwound is also fixed. An observed 
depreciation of the euro therefore generates 
expectations that the single currency will in -
crease in value. This mechanism, taken to -
gether, means that returns align perfectly with 
each other such that uncovered interest parity 
holds. Accordingly, if investors are risk- neutral, 
an assumed US interest rate advantage over 
the euro area for three-  month money would 
have to be offset by an expected appreciation 
of the euro against the US dollar over the in -
vestment period of three months.
An empirical study of the uncovered interest 
parity theory conducted recently by the Bun -
desbank approximates the expected adjust -
ment of the exchange rate based on its actual 
movements. This approach was already chosen Equilibrium

37 According to the remarks by the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (2013), assets are eligible as HQLA 
only if they can be converted easily and immediately into 
cash at little or no loss of value. The liquidity of an asset de -
pends on the volume to be monetised and the timeframe 
considered. Assets issued by financial institutions are con -
sidered to be relatively illiquid in times of liquidity stress in 
the banking sector. Balances held in central banks’ deposit 
facility are counted toward the required stock of high-  
quality liquid assets, meanwhile. The treatment of central 
bank balances in the LCR is outlined in Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (2015).
38 It should, however, be borne in mind that deposits 
placed in the deposit facility are callable on a daily basis, 
which thus gives rise to (minimal) interest rate risk. Covered 
interest parity, on the other hand, considers investments 
whose interest rates are fixed over the investment period.Deutsche Bundesbank

in the 2005 Monthly Report, meaning that the 
results are comparable.39 Assuming rational ex -
pectations and risk neutrality on the part of in -
vestors, the actual movement of the exchange 
rate ought to match the expected adjustment 
on average. Deviations that actually occur 
ought to be purely random in nature.
If, for individual trading days, the exchange rate 
change of the euro- US dollar spot rate over 
three months is compared with the interest 
rate differential applying in each case to three- 
month money between the United States and 
the euro area, marked deviations from un -
covered interest parity are evident, with the ex -
change rate change exceeding the interest rate 
differential many times over, on average. This 
phenomenon was evident both between early 
1999 and mid- 2005 and in the period there -
after. The empirical study presented in the 
2005 Monthly Report found, furthermore, that 
the higher- interest currency tended, on aver -
age, to appreciate more than the lower- interest one, which is at odds with the theory.40 The 
lack of evidence for the uncovered interest par -
ity theory has been the subject of a host of the -
oretical and empirical papers.41 The academic 
literature listed time- varying risk premia, fore -
casting errors concerning rational expectations 
and a phenomenon known as the “peso prob -
lem” as potential causes.

40 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2005); this article examines 
returns on hypothetical currency carry trades between the 
launch of monetary union and 30 June 2005. As outlined 
below, a currency carry trade involves borrowing funds in a 
low- interest currency and investing them in a high- interest 
currency, and not hedging the transaction.

empirical results and explanatory approaches in connection

confirmed for the subsequent period after mid- 
2005. In the sample from mid- 2005 to the end 
of 2021, the higher- interest currency appreci -
ated on roughly as many days as it depreciated 
in line with the uncovered interest parity the -
ory. Similar results can be obtained if uncovered 
interest parity is tested by regressing the actual 
exchange rate change on the interest rate dif -
ferential and a constant for different periods.42 
To this end, a dedicated analysis43 of the euro’s 
exchange rate against the US dollar, pound 
sterling, yen and Swiss franc was performed, 
with the investigation period being divided into 
two samples. The first covers the period from 
the beginning of 1999 to immediately before 
the onset of the financial crisis in August 2007, 
while the second covers the period since its 
onset to the end of 2021. The full sample was 
subdivided in this manner in order to see 
whether the relationship between the ex -
change rate change and the interest rate differ -
ential had altered.
The econometric study does indeed indicate 
that the results depend heavily on the under -
lying sample. While the validity of uncovered 
interest parity for the sample in question 
(launch of European monetary union until im -
mediately before the global financial crisis) is 
rejected for all four currency pairs considered 
here, this is only the case for the yen, statistic -
ally speaking, in the post- global financial crisis 
period. In the more recent sample, the esti -
mated slopes are all significantly higher than 
those in the pre- global financial crisis sample 
and – unlike in the earlier sample – now have a 
positive sign. The results imply that since the 
onset of the global financial crisis, it has tended 
to be the currency in which the higher- interest 
investment is denominated that depreciates 
over the investment period. Overall, then, the 
empirical evidence observed post global finan -
cial crisis has been more consistent with un -
covered interest parity than in the earlier sam -
ple. However, whether this finding is robust 
and can be traced back to an actual change in 
the underlying relationship cannot be assessed 
conclusively owing to the high estimation un -certainty and unstable parameter values, even 
within the respective estimation periods.
A currency carry trading investment strategy 
can be used to generate profits from deviations 
from uncovered interest parity. A currency carry 
trade involves borrowing funds in a low- interest 
currency and investing them in a high- interest 
currency. Since investors choose not to hedge 
these transactions, returns on currency carry 
trades crucially depend on how the exchange 
rate between the currency pair actually de -
velops up to the end of the investment period. 
A currency carry trade is particularly lucrative if 
the higher- interest currency appreciates, as 
was the case on average between 1999 and 
2005: the investor makes exchange rate gains 
on top of the interest rate advantage. Thus, if 
an investor had applied the currency carry trade 
strategy to the euro area and the United States 
in a thought experiment, they would have gen -
erated an average annualised return of around 
15% between the beginning of 1999 and mid- 
2005. Seeing the higher- interest currency ap -
preciate may have encouraged speculators to 
invest further in carry trades, which would have 
strengthened the appreciation of the higher-  
interest currency and thus the deviation from 
uncovered interest parity. On balance, the em -
pirical finding that the higher- interest currency 
appreciated on average between the beginning 
of 1999 and mid- 2005 may therefore have 
been amplified or even induced by carry trade 
strategies.
However, an assessment of more recent periods 
shows that this strategy can produce a far 
smaller return. Thus, the illustrative carry trade 
strategy described above would have produced Less empirical

42 For more on this, see also Engel et al. (2022). The 
authors test the relationship between the US dollar and 
various currencies for one period up to the end of 2006 
and a second period as of 2007. They find that the signs of 
the estimated coefficients depend on the sample examined 
and find, for the period as of 2007, that “[…] the evidence 
for a UIP puzzle is weak”. Bussière et al. (2022) conclude 
that the sign switches primarily because the correlation be -
tween interest rate differentials and expectations errors 
changes.

a loss on average (-1%) between mid- 2005 and 
the end of 2021, compared with -14% when 
the financial crisis was at its peak (defined here 
as the period between the beginning of August 
2007 and the end of 2008), and only a slim 
profit of just over 1% from then until the end of 
2021. This shows that the return on carry trade 
investments fluctuates strongly owing to the 
high volatility of exchange rates over time, and 
illustrates that carry trades are a highly specula -
tive and risky investment strategy. The turmoil 
that has repeatedly weighed on financial mar -
kets in recent years is likely to have had two ef -
fects. First, it will have dampened the appetite 
for risk, at least for a time. Second, inter -
national interest rate differentials have nar -
rowed in the global low interest rate environ -
ment. Taken together, these two factors have 
probably worsened the expected risk- return 
profile of carry trade strategies and reduced 
carry trade activity, at least temporarily.
Conclusion
The period since the global financial crisis has 
seen considerable and at times persistent devi -
ations from covered interest parity. This came 
as a surprise because it had been assumed that 
these deviations would offer foreign exchange 
market participants the opportunity to gener -
ate risk- free profits. As it turns out, though, im -
portant conditions for interest rate arbitrage, 
which had previously kept deviations from 
covered interest rate parity low, have no longer 
been met since the crisis. For example, coun -
terparty risk grew in significance for potential 
interest rate arbitrageurs, prompting them to 
demand a correspondingly high premium in re -
turn for taking on the risk of default. The Ba -
sel III decisions phased in since 2013 have fur -
thermore driven up the costs of interest rate ar -
bitrage, which reduced the scope for arbitrage 
further still. Swap lines agreed between central banks to improve banks’ liquidity in foreign cur -
rency counteract an abrupt increase in the cost 
of hedging against exchange rate risk in times 
of crisis and help stabilise financial markets.
Deviations from uncovered interest parity are 
evident throughout the full sample. Economet -
ric studies suggest, however, that the relation -
ship between the spot exchange rate and the 
interest rate differential has changed since the 
financial crisis. They indicate that unlike in the 
pre- financial crisis period, it tends to be the 
currency in which the higher- interest invest -
ments are denominated that depreciates over 
the three- month period under review. A finding 
of that kind is generally consistent with the un -
covered interest parity theory. However, these 
results are subject to a high degree of estima -
tion uncertainty. One reason for the change in 
correlation might be that the expected risk-  
return profile of carry trade strategies deterior -
ated during the low interest rate period, result -
ing in less currency carry trading activity. It can -
not be ruled out that this trade strategy will re -
gain importance as interest rate differentials 
between the currency areas grow larger again.Return on a hypothetical currency carry

Market conditions for Bunds in the 
context  of monetary policy purchases 
and heightened uncertainty
The overall state of the market for Federal securities (Bundeswertpapiere, or Bunds for short) 
– also referred to as its market conditions – is characterised by a generally very high degree of 
robustness. In conjunction with the high credit quality of the Federal Government, this is why 
Bunds enjoy benchmark status in the euro area. A sound assessment of market conditions in 
recent years is achieved by using standard and novel market indicators on volatility, price anom -
alies and, in particular, market liquidity.
Cash, future and repo markets are the three main segments in the market for Bunds. Although 
there are very close links between price and liquidity formation in these segments, there are also 
pronounced peculiarities and one- off effects at times. A look at various liquidity dimensions is 
therefore conducive to obtaining a better understanding of both the respective market segments 
themselves and their interrelationships. For example, although the Bund future market generally 
has price leadership over the cash market, liquidity shocks frequently originate in the cash market 
and can then spill over to liquidity in the future market. Phases of such temporary liquidity declines 
have been increasingly occurring in recent years. Sudden and highly symmetrical transactions by 
multiple agents, such as at the beginning of the COVID-  19 crisis, are capable of triggering price 
swings and rapid changes in the liquidity situation in all Bund market segments. This can be illus -
trated for the Bund future market, in particular, very well with the help of a novel indicator to 
measure market resilience.
The changes observed in the market for Bunds since 2015 have been driven, above all, by the 
Eurosystem’s role as a “monetary policy buyer”. Although trading volumes and market- making 
activities may initially increase as a result of central bank purchases, in a tense market environ -
ment characterised by a high propensity to sell, this could even temporarily reduce transaction 
costs of purchased bonds. By reducing “free float”, however, the extensive central bank purchases 
lead to scarcity effects and, in some cases, to price anomalies for these bonds, too. Mitigating 
measures taken by the Eurosystem, such as the securities lending facility, can only partly offset 
these effects. In the long term, therefore, reductions in Eurosystem holdings are likely to have a 
positive impact on market conditions for Bunds.
The current high level of uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, which is associ -
ated primarily with Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, is also impacting on the indica -
tors of market conditions for Bunds. In this environment, too, the obvious contribution a central 
bank can make towards ultimately more relaxed market conditions is to keep medium- term infla -
tion expectations as firmly anchored as possible.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The overall state of a market, known as the 
market conditions, is determined by its players, 
its structure and its framework conditions.1 
Market liquidity – i.e. the tradability of secur -
ities – is a significant and measurable compon -
ent of market conditions. In addition, a high 
level of volatility can be a reflection of increased 
information processing but can also indicate a 
change in market conditions, especially if it is 
associated with reduced market liquidity and 
(price) anomalies. This report aims to assess the 
market conditions for Bunds as holistically as 
possible and thus looks at many of these facets.
Market conditions for Bunds are of particular 
interest because they represent a benchmark in 
the European sovereign bond market. Financial 
markets are subject to a myriad of influences 
and constant changes, making the need for a 
benchmark as a guidepost for market partici -
pants particularly clear. Benchmark bonds mir -
ror the current, broad market conditions and 
should therefore be as free as possible from the 
influence of idiosyncratic factors such as high 
and volatile default and liquidity risks. At the 
same time, they also constitute a key bench -
mark for macroeconomic financing conditions, 
which are also influenced to a large extent by 
monetary policy decisions.
Owing to its high credit quality and the ease 
with which its bonds are tradable, the Federal 
Government has the status of benchmark is -
suer in the euro area. This means that Bunds 
are generally in high demand and are used in 
many portfolios held by institutional investors, 
such as insurers or pension funds, as a risk- free 
investment and as a benchmark for other asset 
classes.2
The generally high market liquidity of Bunds is 
a decisive factor behind their benchmark sta -
tus. A salient feature of a liquid market is that 
high volumes of a security can be bought or 
sold at low transaction costs with no significant 
impact on its price. Liquidity3 in financial mar -kets depends largely on the market participants 
involved. A liquid market is associated with a 
low resale risk and thus attracts market partici -
pants which, by wanting to purchase a security 
or offering to sell a security, in turn create 
liquidity. It is especially in times of heightened 
volatility that a liquid market is of particular im -
portance.
Episodes of liquidity slumps are rare, but they 
can occur in isolated cases even in the most 
liquid markets with benchmark status. How -
ever, such episodes have been unusually fre -
quent in the recent past, as was the case at the 
beginning of the COVID-  19 crisis in March 
2020. Moreover, in the last few years, monet -
ary policymakers, academics and practitioners 
have been wondering about the extent to 
which non- standard monetary policy measures, 
such as large- scale asset purchase programmes, 
have been impacting on market liquidity by re -
ducing free float, contributing to such episodes 
and potentially structurally altering the market 
conditions for benchmark bonds.
In- depth insights into these observations are 
provided by studies that examine the dimen -
sions and interrelationships of the market con -
ditions for Bunds in the various, albeit inter -
linked segments – the cash market, the future 
market and the repo market. In focusing on re -
cent years, they also look into the effects of the Market condi -

1 Whereas some facets of market conditions are static or 
slow to change (for example, statutory provisions or mar -
ket structure), other aspects of market conditions (such as 
participants’ trading activities and liquidity) are in a con -
stant state of flux. The facets differ not only with regard to 
the time dynamics but also to their conduciveness to a 
quantitative description: rules or market structures, in par -
ticular, can be described in qualitative terms, whereas mar -
ket activities and market liquidity lend themselves better to 
a quantitative analysis. As regards the two lattermost 
facets, market liquidity is also characterised by a generally 
much greater degree of transparency and data availability 
than market participants’ activities (for instance, who pur -
chased a given security?). Against this backdrop, the article 
will primarily focus on well- measurable components of 
market conditions such as market liquidity, volatility or 
price anomalies.

regime change from monetary policy easing to 
a monetary policy tightening cycle.
Key market players and 
 market segments
With regard to market conditions, market par -
ticipants can be divided into two groups: in -
vestors and liquidity providers. Since the start 
of the large- scale asset purchase programmes 
in 2015, the Eurosystem central banks have 
entered the scene as key market players. Unlike 
the other groups, their motive is not to make a 
profit. Investors represent the majority of the 
players and use trading venues, via which they 
implement their transaction decisions.4 The 
second group, composed of dedicated liquidity 
providers (market-makers or dealers),5 plays a 
particular role. These agents’ business (sub-)
model is aimed at generating earnings through 
the constant and, mostly, simultaneous buying 
and selling of securities. To this end, they pro -
vide other market players with transaction 
offers with executable prices and quantities 
(“quotes”), thereby enabling investors to imple -
ment their trading orders almost permanently 
and quickly. A liquid market usually features a 
large number of liquidity providers, a highly 
competitive market among them and high de -
mand for the respective security, which makes 
transactions inexpensive and simple to effect. 
Moreover, market-makers’ purchasing and sell -
ing capacity in the market has a stabilising ef -
fect on the trading process and often helps to 
contain short- term, strong market swings.
In very liquid market segments, such as the 
Bund future market, ten- year Bund futures 
alone can account for a combined total of sev -
eral hundred thousand individual transactions 
on a normal trading day. In this complex inter -
play between buyers and sellers, the cumula -
tive sales decisions can potentially significantly 
exceed market-makers’ absorption capacity for 
a short period, or an abrupt onset of buying 
pressure can exceed liquidity providers’ ability 
to deliver. In addition, market participants can impair the functioning of the market by with -
drawing previously issued buy and sell orders 
from the market even prior to execution.6 In 
these cases, liquidity deteriorates, and the mar -
ket is more exposed to sharp price swings. 
Dealing activity in such a market is therefore 
the result of close interaction between invest -
ors and market-makers. It is therefore import -
ant to look at all market participants across the 
varying market segments in order to obtain a 
holistic understanding of the market.
The cash market
Trading in Bunds takes place largely over the 
counter (OTC). Investors usually issue requests 
for quote (RFQs) via electronic trading plat -
forms in order to subsequently receive offers 
from dealers. In the secondary market for 
Bunds, these are mostly large banks (dealer 
banks), which are also members of the Bund 
Issues Auction Group of the German Finance 
Agency,7 and which often maintain close rela -
tionships with other market participants. Not Dealers and

4 At regular stock exchanges, these transaction decisions 
are mostly entered as a buy or sell order into an electronic 
order book by the investor (or an intermediary such as a 
broker or a bank). There are, in principle, two types of 
orders: market orders and limit orders. A market order ex -
presses an investor’s desire for the order to be executed in 
the most timely manner possible without a specific price 
limit. In a limit order, by contrast, the investor specifies a 
fixed maximum ask price or minimum bid price at which 
they wish to execute. However, the actual execution can -
not be guaranteed and depends on the security’s price 
movements and the liquidity situation at the respective 
trading venue. Limit orders that cannot be executed imme -
diately are transferred to the order book and, along with 
other pre- existing limit orders, represent the aggregate 
market interest in buying or selling a particular security.
5 On OTC trading platforms, which are a major factor in 
the secondary market for Bunds, continuous market-  
making generally does not occur; instead, dealers submit 
quotes following a request for quote (RFQ).
6 Such sharp declines in orders in an order book are also 
referred to as “liquidity evaporation” or “dry- ups”. They are 
often observed, for instance, in the last few minutes before 
significant and fixed dates for the publication of macroeco -
nomic data or monetary policy decisions.
7 A special feature of this auction group is that – unlike 
standard procedures in other sovereign bond markets  – 
they are not under any further obligations (such as regard -
ing market-makers) above and beyond a small minimum 
purchase amount in the primary market. See also https://

only banks but also hedge funds contribute to 
liquidity in the OTC cash market, but their im -
portance is more difficult to quantify.8 A smaller 
percentage of Bunds are traded on conven -
tional exchanges, where the Bundesbank, too, 
conducts market management operations on 
behalf and for the account of the Finance 
Agency.9,10 In addition, exchange trading be -
tween banks takes place on the Italian limit 
order book platform, MTS.11
The largest group of liquidity providers in the 
cash market, the dealer banks, obtain Bunds 
from the Finance Agency on the primary mar -
ket.12 In the past, the trading partners of these 
dealer banks in the secondary market were also 
mostly banks. However, the share of banks fell 
from 50% at the beginning of 2018 to 38% in 
July 2022 (see the chart above). Over the same 
period, the share of financial institutions that 
are not banks or brokers13 in the monthly trad -
ing volume with the dealer banks increased 
from 36% to 49%. There are several possible 
reasons for this development, such as new 
regulatory requirements or changing business 
models. A further reason could be that banks 
without access to primary market issues pur -
chased Bunds on the secondary market but, 
since 2014, have been holding a steadily dimin -
ishing amount of these.14 Banks are usually 
monetary policy counterparties of the Eurosys -tem and thus have access to the deposit facil -
ity. Given that the interest rate on many Bunds 
had in recent years remained below the deposit 
facility rate over longer periods of time, this fa -
cility gave them a more attractive substitute for 
holding high- quality liquid assets (HQLA).

8 In this vein, they can contribute to levelling out valuation 
differences, such as between the Bund cash and future 
market, via relative value trades (see pp. 79 ff.).
9 These market management operations are targeted at 
prices which do not discriminate between different types 
of market participants such as institutional and private in -
vestors.
10 The Finance Agency’s data generally show with whom 
the Bund Issues Auction Group is trading in the secondary 
market. The members of the Auction Group report their 
dealing activities to the Finance Agency, which then makes 
these data available in aggregated form. If, for instance, a 
bank that is not a member of the Auction Group conducts 
a transaction with a hedge fund, this trade is not contained 
in the statistics. The Auction Group, however, covers a 
large swathe of the market.

chase programme (PEPP)15 were discontinued 
in March 2022, however, a declining trend has 
become visible.16 By contrast, the share of the 
trading volume of Bunds accounted for by the 
Finance Agency itself is growing.17
The composition of investor groups for Bunds 
impacts on market functioning inasmuch as, 
for many of these groups, Bunds represent a 
long-  term investment. These long-  term invest -
ors are typically insurers, pension funds or for -
eign central banks. The securities in their port -
folios are then often no longer available for 
market trading. The “free float”18 of an asset 
class, i.e. the amount which is, in principle, 
available for trading, is of major importance for 
market functioning and market liquidity.
In the wake of the Eurosystem’s asset purchase 
programmes, both the relative and absolute 
free float of Bunds fell between 2014 and the 
end of 2021. The share of free float in the out -
standing volume decreased by around 22 per -
centage points to 31%.19 The reduced volume 
of assets available for trading increasingly led 
to periods of scarcity that negatively affected 
market conditions. Following the ECB Govern -
ing Council’s decision in late 2021 to discon -
tinue net purchases under the PEPP from the 
end of March 2022, the relative free float re -
bounded slightly in the first half of 2022.20

turned to positive territory, this could attract

15 This was a temporary asset purchase programme of pri -
vate and public sector securities implemented to counter 
the threats posed by the extraordinary economic and mar -
ket conditions on the ability of the Eurosystem to fulfil its 
mandate. It was launched on 26 March 2020 and ran in 
addition to the asset purchase programme (APP). Its ori -
ginal envelope was €750 billion but was increased over the 
programme’s lifetime to a total of €1,850 billion.
16 The central bank share also includes non- Eurosystem 
central banks.
17 In its auctions, the Finance Agency regularly sets aside a 
share of securities for market management purposes, most 
of which are then allotted to secondary market operations 
following the auction. In addition, it can also step up its 
own proprietary holdings. See https:// www.deutsche-

18 Free float refers to holdings of an issuance that are 
freely available for trading – as opposed to the stock held 
by investors who acquire bonds and then hold them to ma -
turity (known as “buy and hold investors”). There is no uni -
form definition of free float. However, using the Eurosys -
tem’s Securities Holdings Statistics by Sector (SHSS), this 
can be approximated by the sum of private sector holdings 
less insurers and pension funds. Assets in circulation not 
captured by the SHSS are assigned in equal shares to free 
float and buy- and- hold investors. Under this approach, free 
float is interpreted in a broader sense, as many investment 
funds and banks likewise hold instruments to maturity. 
These percentage shares can only be estimated, however, 
and have therefore not been recorded. Further details on 
the data chosen and the analysis for the December 2014 to 
December 2021 period can be found in the May 2022 
issue of the Monthly Report. See also Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2022a).
19 As a result of the higher net issuance stemming from 
the fiscal measures and the monetary policy measures 
taken, percentage and absolute free float have diverged 
since the second quarter of 2020. The Federal Govern -
ment’s strong issuance activity during the pandemic ex -
ceeded the Eurosystem’s purchases of German government 
bonds. However, a large percentage of the issues were re -
tained, thereby increasing the Federal Government’s pro -
prietary holdings. The percentage share of the free float 
thus declined further to around 30% at the end of the 
period under review. However, at the same time, the abso -
lute volume in free float rose slightly by just over €38 billion 
to a little more than €500 billion. See also Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2022a).

bers in the low interest rate environment (see 
p. 73 f.). This ought to help increase free float 
as banks generally participate actively in trad -
ing. The Federal Government’s net new issu -
ance is another key determinant. Higher sover -
eign debt boosts supply in the market and thus 
also tends to increase free float.
Cash market dealers do not necessarily have to

ships, external market contacts or the repo 
market (short covering).
The repo market
Repo transactions are the most important in -
strument in the secured money market, which 
also includes instruments such as securities 
lending and securities swaps.21
A repo consists of two transactions in which a 
sum of money is exchanged for a security. At 
the start of the transaction, the repo buyer is 
lent a security as collateral for a pre- defined 
period of time and compensates the repo seller 
with a monetary amount. The repo market is therefore also of central importance when 
looking at liquidity (and liquidity provision) in 
the cash market. The overwhelming majority of 
trades in this market are conducted via central 
counterparties (CCPs).22,23 If, after a transaction 
has been concluded on the cash market, the 
dealer cannot obtain the security directly, they 
can temporarily cover their demand for this 
security via the secured money market. To do 
so, they enter into a specific collateral (SC) repo 
transaction in which this security has been 
posted as collateral.24 If demand for this par -
ticular security in the repo market rises and 
there is little free float, the price that repo 
buyers have to pay to borrow this security also 
rises. This leads to a higher scarcity premium,

tions between the CCP and the respective counterparty.

24 In addition to these securities- driven SC transactions, it 
is also possible to borrow or lend a security from a pool of 
several securities against cash collateral. In these cases, 
transactions are liquidity-  driven, as the repo buyer cannot 
influence what security they are provided with as collateral.Deutsche Bundesbank

and SC rates. Such tensions in the repo market 
can make it more difficult to intermediate be -
tween buyers and sellers of Bunds on the cash 
market.
Secured euro money market rates have gener -
ally been below the Eurosystem’s deposit facil -
ity rate in recent years. This has been driven by 
not only the scarcity of securities but also high 
central bank balances. These were created, in 
particular, by non- standard monetary policy 
measures, such as asset purchases, and en -
courage a concentration of money market ac -
tivity on transactions between market partici -
pants that have access to central banks ac -
counts and those that do not.25
The future market
Bund futures26 are standardised futures con -
tracts on notional Bunds. They are traded exclu -
sively on the electronic Eurex futures exchange. 
Market participants can use Bund futures to 
hedge their bond positions or to speculate on 
changes in interest rates or prices in Bunds with 
different maturities. They serve as a pricing and 
hedging instrument for liquidity providers in the 
cash market. Turmoil in the future market can 
therefore also make it more difficult to provide 
liquidity in the cash market and vice versa. 
What sets the Bund future market apart from 
the Bund cash and Bund repo market is a high 
level of standardisation and centralisation and 
thus large trading volumes with a significant 
share of high- frequency traders.27 This means 
that it usually has price leadership over the cash 
market (see the box beginning on p. 79).
Only a relatively small percentage of market 
players trading in Bund futures have direct ac -
cess to the Eurex futures exchange. Following 
the entry into force of the European Markets 
Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), there now 
exists an extensive derivatives transaction regis -
ter which represents the Bund future market. 
The data also contain those market participants 
who do not have direct access to the Eurex fu -tures exchange and thus cannot participate dir -
ectly in Eurex clearing. An analysis of EMIR data 
from January 2020 to July 2022 shows that 
these mostly smaller market participants, such 
as investment funds or other non- banks, par -
ticipate indirectly in trading via clearing partici -
pants, known as client clearers, which have dir -
ect access to Eurex. This causes business activ -
ities to be highly centralised as client clearers, 
which include banks, in particular, are involved 
in more than four out of five Bund future trans -
actions – often, but not only, as intermediaries.
High- frequency traders are an additional im -
portant factor: they are involved in at least 
one- quarter of all transactions. Although they 
account for a large number of transactions, 
they have a relatively small volume per transac -
tion compared with other market players such 
as banks.28 In addition, high- frequency traders 
operate mainly on an intraday basis and thus 
short- term, which is why they have only a few 
open positions at the end of the day. They pur -
sue a variety of different trading strategies, 
such as “news trading”, in which they use their 
speed advantage to generate short- term profits 
in anticipation of and following the publication 
of key macroeconomic data. Most high-  
frequency traders, however, act as liquidity pro -
viders, such as via “market-maker strategies”. 
Yet empirical studies show that, especially in an 
environment of heightened uncertainty, such Bund futures are 
an important 
pricing and 
hedging 
instrument

26 The term Bund futures is used here as a synonym for 
the various futures contracts where Bunds are the under -
lying instrument. These notional Bunds have maturities of 
two (Schatz future), five (Bobl future), ten (Bund future) 
and 30 years (Buxl future). The nominal value of a contract 
is €100,000.
27 High-  frequency trading (HFT) is an algorithmic trading 
technique using special computer hardware and particu -
larly fast data connections to the stock exchange. It is char -
acterised by very high daily order counts, relatively small 
order sizes and, in most cases, very short holding periods 
for the positions taken. HFT algorithms are capable of re -
sponding extremely quickly to changes in the market and 
to news.
28 High- frequency traders trade an average of four Bund 
future contracts per individual transaction. At 14, 26 and 
131 contracts per transaction respectively, banks, pension 
funds and insurers have considerably higher contract- to- 
transaction ratios.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

as the publication of important data, they often 
withdraw quickly by deleting previously submit -
ted trading orders.29 This is also reflected in the 
EMIR data, as high- frequency traders, in par -
ticular, are cautious immediately before antici -
pated, landmark ECB Governing Council deci -
sions, such as on 9 June 2022, when the end of 
net asset purchases and the prospect of initial 
interest rate moves were announced. However, 
their activities increase once the news is known. 
By contrast, the number of market players 
across all sectors in a volatile market environ -
ment, such as at the outbreak of the COVID-  19 
pandemic or the Russian war of aggression 
against Ukraine, has temporarily increased. 
These are usually additional investors who are 
otherwise active in the Bund future market at 
only irregular intervals and mostly on a small 
scale and who are now using future contracts 
to adjust their positions. Cumulated and sym -
metrical transactions by these irregular market 
agents could then cause a trend reduction in 
liquidity.
The Eurosystem’s impact  
in its role as a market player 
since 2015 
The Eurosystem’s share of holdings in the Bund 
market has been steadily growing since pur -chases of bonds issued by euro area central 
governments, agencies and European institu -
tions under the public sector purchase pro -
gramme (PSPP) began in 2015. High monthly 
net purchases have made the Eurosystem the 
largest holder of Bunds. It has therefore as -
sumed a prominent position as a market agent.
From a theoretical point of view, it is unclear 
whether central bank purchases have positive 
or negative effects on liquidity or market func -
tioning. On the one hand, asset purchases can 
stimulate trading volumes since purchases gen -
erally encourage portfolio adjustments. More -
over, the presence of the central bank as a 
large, solvent and reliable buyer may increase 
market-making activities since it can reduce un -
wanted positions more quickly and also exe -
cute larger orders more easily (the “backstop” 
buyer channel30). This could also enhance 
market-makers’ willingness to hold larger bond 
portfolios, which would then facilitate trading 
between market participants.31Central bank

Relationship between the Bund future and cash market
The standardisation of Bund future contracts 
and the signifi  cantly lower need for funds 
compared with cash market transactions re-
sult in a signifi  cant share of high- frequency 
trading in the Bund future market as well as 
very liquid trading under normal conditions. 
For instance, the prices of Bund futures react 
extremely quickly to news.1
By contrast, Bunds in the cash market are 
largely traded over the counter (OTC) via vari-
ous electronic trading platforms. The cash 
market is therefore more fragmented and 
opaque compared with Bund futures trading 
on Eurex. In addition, at over 60 Federal 
securities, the number of securities traded 
here is signifi  cantly greater than the four types 
of maturity- dependent Bund futures. The 
transaction fi  gures are lower (and less trans-
parent) than those for Bund futures, which 
means that price discovery processes take 
place less regularly.
The future and cash market are closely inter-
twined, as signifi  cant price differences result 
in arbitrage opportunities. Sellers of futures 
must deliver a Bund of their choice from a 
basket of eligible bonds to the future buyer 
on the maturity date. One of these bonds 
– the cheapest- to- deliver (CTD) bond – is the 
cheapest for the supplier. In an effi   cient mar-
ket, the prices of the CTD bond and the asso-
ciated future should therefore correspond 
after applying a conversion factor that ap-
proximates the maturity and coupon differ-
ences between the actual and the notional 
bond. Recently, CTD prices in the Bund market 
have exceeded the adjusted future prices on a 
regular basis, possibly driven by the scarcity of 
Bunds induced by central bank purchases.2 
This difference is known as the cash- future 
basis (CFB) and is regarded as an indicator of 
market functionality. A positive CFB indicates 
relatively high prices in the cash market. Mar-
ket participants could benefi  t from these price 
differences by short selling the bond and buy-
ing the future at the same time.3 The price dif-ference is gross income. At maturity, the arbi-
trageur receives the CTD from the future seller 
and can return it to the borrower. In principle, 
this arbitrage opportunity ensures that prices 
in both markets diverge only temporarily and 
to a limited degree in most cases. However, a 
lack of market liquidity and high trading costs, 
bond scarcity in the cash and repo markets, 
regulatory barriers or market turbulence can 
limit arbitrage opportunities and explain the 
existence of the CFB.
Up until the end of the 1990s, price discovery 
primarily took place in the cash market. Since 
then, new technologies, standardised con-
tracts and the low use of funds have essen-
tially caused price leadership to become es-
tablished in the future market.4 Recent studies 
also confi  rm that price discovery for both US 
and euro government bonds primarily takes 
place in the future market.5
On electronic trading platforms such as the 
Eurex futures exchange, transactions in Bund 
futures are settled via a central limit order 
book. All bid and ask quotes, which include 
the corresponding prices and quantities, are 
collected here. These quotes are binding. 
Similarly to Eurex, data from the Italian trad-
ing platform MTS6 can also be used to con-
struct a limit order book with a timestamp in 
seconds for the cash market for Bunds. Al-
though the share of actual transactions is 
small compared with the OTC cash market, 
market participants consistently quote binding 
prices and quantities here.

(2016).

the replication business and to receive the Bund for 
short selling.
4 However, large transactions in the cash market can 
also affect prices in the future market. For more infor-
mation, see Upper and Werner (2007).

An analysis based on the high- frequency order 
book data from MTS and the Eurex futures ex-
change confi  rms that the price leadership of 
futures can also be found in the market for 
Bunds. To this end, a simple bivariate vector 
autoregressive (VAR) model is used to test for 
Granger causality between futures and cash 
prices.7 The analysis is applied on an intraday 
basis to all of the days from January 2020 to 
June 2022 individually, as well as to a total of 
12 different frequencies. It is thus clear how 
long the transfer takes between markets and 
whether the transfer signifi  cance and duration 
differ on individual days. A distribution of the 
signifi  cances (shown as p- values) across all the 
individual days considered helps to categorise the results. P- values below 0.1 can be con-
sidered statistically signifi  cant.
The results show that futures prices have a 
signifi  cant impact on prices in the MTS cash 
market within two seconds. After more than 
one minute, the effect is no longer detectable 
(see the upper panel of the adjacent chart). 
The spillover effect tends to be less signifi  cant 
on particularly volatile days. Conversely, there 
is no consistent signifi  cant spillover from cash 
prices to futures prices.
In addition, a similar analysis in the literature 
reveals a spillover of both price volatility8 and 
liquidity in the future market to liquidity in the 
cash market for sovereign bonds.9 This rela-
tionship is not confi  rmed for Bunds in short 
frequencies. The reverse is true since, on par-
ticularly volatile days,10 liquidity from the cash 
market partly spills over to liquidity in the fu-
ture market (see the lower panel of the adja-
cent chart) as well as partly to the volatility of 
futures.11 This effect can be seen, for instance, 
during the COVID- 19 pandemic or Russia’s 
war of aggression against Ukraine, when tem-
porary shocks began. These shocks initially oc-
curred in the cash market and then spilled 
over to the Bund future market.
The empirical studies confi  rm the close inter-
connectedness of the two markets in both di-
rections. Therefore, it is always advisable to 
view these markets together when assessing 
market conditions.

On the other hand, in addition to regulatory32 
factors, asset purchases affect the quantity of 
securities available on the market. As a result, 
central bank purchases can be seen as shocks 
to the available supply of bonds because free 
float in this market segment is reduced.33 This 
could impact adversely on liquidity and market 
functioning because the purchase of a certain 
bond on the market is associated with higher 
costs or search frictions.
Moreover, due to the relatively stable monthly 
volume targets (over a long period of time), 
central banks respond to current price and 
liquidity conditions when conducting purchases 
only with a time lag, which could disrupt price 
formation in the market. That, in turn, could 
discourage market participants from being in -
volved in trading. If the frequency and target 
volume of a purchase programme are very high 
relative to the usual trading activities in the 
market segment and to bond issuance, this can 
likewise have a negative effect on market func -
tioning. In that case, the markets could have 
trouble processing the unusually large amount 
of capital flows. Lastly, information asymmet -
ries between the central banks’ direct trading 
partners and other market participants could 
lead to imbalances and disincentivise the latter 
from participating in trading.34
Empirical evidence on the 
 impact of extensive purchase 
programmes on market 
 liquidity
Whereas the impact of the announcements 
concerning the PSPP (stock effects) is clearly as -
sociated with falling bond market yields,35 the 
empirical evidence for effects directly following 
the purchase (flow effects) is not conclusive.36 
The few studies which look at the impact on 
sovereign bond market liquidity likewise fail to 
reach clear- cut conclusions.
For the European bond market, there is evi -
dence that purchases in less liquid markets lead to improved liquidity ratios.37 This does not 
hold for high- demand Bunds, though, for 
which it was found that central bank purchases 
improve liquidity in the short term but impair 
liquidity in the longer term.38 The scarcity of 
bonds turns out to be of crucial importance for 
liquidity. If a bond is particularly scarce, it is also 
more difficult or more expensive to trade, 
which in turn implies worse market liquidity. 
Similar results are obtained by studies on the 
Japanese government bond market which 
examine the impact of the Bank of Japan’s 
bond buying programme. These studies like -
wise show that market liquidity deteriorates 
relative to the outstanding volume particularly 
as from a certain threshold of the Bank of Ja -
pan’s bond holdings.39 On the other hand, no 
impact of the Federal Reserve System’s pur -
chases of US Treasuries on various liquidity 
ratios could be identified.40
In the box beginning on p. 83, the effects of 
the purchases on the market liquidity of Bunds 
are examined in greater detail, taking into ac -
count the monetary policy normalisation that 
began in December 2021. While the results for 
the full period of net asset purchases (2015 to 
2022) are inconclusive – the bid- ask spread ex -
pands while the order book depth increases – 
the exit announcements lead to a deterioration 
in liquidity indicators.… but also lead 
to higher costs

dence regarding

liquidity not

an increase in structural demand for HQLA such as Bunds 
(where they are remunerated above the deposit facility); 
the leverage ratio (LR), on the other hand, makes it more 
expensive to expand the balance sheet and thus also to 
hold Bunds.

The results in the literature for the repo market, 
on the other hand, are conclusive: PSPP and 
PEPP purchases amplify scarcity effects, and the 
scarcity premium for bonds rises accordingly.41 
Moreover, the scarcity effects are particularly 
strong for bonds held primarily by long- term 
buy and hold investors such as insurers or pen -
sion funds,42 which tend to reduce free float.
The experience of various central banks like -
wise corroborates the empirical results that 
non- standard monetary policy measures have 
positive effects particularly in markets with high 
liquidity premia, as these are reduced by the 
purchases. On the other hand, adverse effects 
result if the measures are in effect for an ex -
tended period of time or their scope is large. In 
addition to reduced market- making or lower 
investor participations, scarcity effects regard -
ing government bonds are of major import -
ance particularly where central bank purchases 
or already purchased bond holdings are very 
high relative to the outstanding volume or issu -
ance is very high, thus reducing free float con -
siderably.43
Approaches to mitigating 
the “free float” problem
Central banks have been pursuing a variety of 
measures to mitigate the negative side effects 
of the extensive asset purchases. First, certain 
rules are taken into account when implement -
ing the purchase programmes (for instance, en -
velopes are limited by issuer and bond issuance 
and, where possible within the scope of these 
and other restrictions, the purchase of particu -
larly scarce instruments is avoided). Moreover, 
attempts are made to purchase the bonds in a 
market- neutral44 manner in order to avoid 
interfering with the relative price formation 
process and mitigate unintended side effects.
The Eurosystem central banks have recently 
used a considerable amount of flexibility to im -
plement the PEPP programme in some cases, 
rather than a predefined, strict monthly envel -ope, in order to adjust the exact amount and 
timing of purchases to suit monetary policy 
needs. For instance, although the PEPP was 
geared in principle to the capital key of the na -
tional central banks, fluctuations in the distri -
bution of purchases over time, across asset 
classes and across countries were also possible. 
The objective pursued here by the ECB Govern -
ing Council was to effectively avert pandemic- 
related risks to the smooth transmission of 
monetary policy.
Securities lending by Eurosystem central banks 
was introduced to support liquidity in the cash 
and repo markets.45 Under this scheme, sover -
eign bond holdings under the Eurosystem’s 
PSPP and PEPP are available for lending through 
repo transactions. The idea behind the conser -
vative pricing of securities lending is to support 
market liquidity particularly in periods of stress 
without affecting repo market activity in nor -
mal times (backstop function).46 Recent studies 
have analysed the impact of Eurosystem secur -
ities lending activities on the scarcity premium 
in the repo market. They show that securities 
lending was actually successful in mitigating 
tensions in the repo market for both Bunds and 
other European sovereign bonds. For Bunds, 
however, the effect is less pronounced than the 
quantified contribution of PSPP purchases to 
the scarcity premium.47 A further study ana -
lyses an adjustment to the price conditions of 
securities lending. More favourable conditions 
increase the volume of securities lending and 
tend to improve market liquidity.48 In principle, 
modifications of securities lending conditions 
need to ensure that the backstop function is … and depends 
on the scope 
and duration of 
the programme

Empirical analysis of the effect of central bank purchases 
on market liquidity
The effect of Bundesbank purchases under 
the public sector purchase programme 
(PSPP) and the pandemic emergency pur-
chase programme (PEPP) on market liquidity 
can be empirically examined using panel re-
gressions. The results also provide informa-
tion on how liquidity measures respond to 
announcements of the launch of, modifi  ca-
tion to and exit from the two purchase pro-
grammes. MTS1 data for the Bund cash 
market from 2015 to 20222 are used as the 
dataset, with the more recent period since 
the PEPP was launched (2020 to 2022) 
being considered separately.
Based on a difference- in- differences regres-
sion analysis, it is possible to measure the 
effect on market liquidity of purchased 
bonds relative to bonds not purchased. 
Both the effect of whether a purchase takes 
place and the effect of the actual purchase 
volume (€ million) on the bid- ask spread 
and on depth are examined.3 In order to 
separate the purchase effect from possible 
other infl  uences on bonds, we control for 
various bond- specifi  c factors (repo scarcity 
premium and repo volume, eligibility, pur-
chase one day prior and multiple purchases 
per bond, age, maturity). In addition, gen-
eral developments in the bond market are 
taken into account using variables such as 
yield spread, volatility and month- end ef-
fects.
The results in the table on p. 84 show that 
central bank purchases lead to a 0.9 basis 
point increase in transaction costs (relative 
bid- ask spread) on the day of the purchase. 
This result hinges on the purchase and less 
on the purchase volume. In the analysis for 
the period from 2015 to 2016, however, 
there is a decrease in transaction costs of purchased bonds relative to bonds not pur-
chased, as expressed by the bid- ask spread.4 
A similar result can be seen when looking at 
the more recent period since the launch of 
the PEPP (March 2020 to July 2022): the 
bid- ask spread falls – at least depending on 
the volume purchased – by around 1.1 basis 
points per €100 million of purchases.
One possible reason for these period- 
dependent results could be the respective 
interest rate developments. In both the 
spring of 2015, during the Bund tantrum,5 
and in the fi  rst half of 2022 owing to ex-
pectations of an exit from the era of low 
rates, the interest rate level rose distinctly 
and with it, temporarily, the pressure to sell. 
In this setting, purchases by the central 
bank had a particularly dampening effect 
on the interest rate level and illiquidity, and 
temporarily overshadowed the effect of the 
relative scarcity of heavily purchased Federal 
bonds. In these phases, purchases thus sup-
port liquidity. During the full period, by con-
trast, the more dominant effect seems to 
be that central bank purchases lead to rela-
tive scarcity, evidenced by an increase in the 
transaction costs of the specifi  c purchased 
bond, for example.
Bonds that are eligible but which are not 
purchased on that day have lower bid- ask 
spreads than bonds that are not eligible. 
This is shown by the signifi  cantly negative

eligibility effect in the full period (panel A). 
Pure eligibility therefore already leads to a 
lower liquidity premium.
Order book depth at the best bid and ask 
price increases as a result of PSPP and PEPP 
purchases. For a daily purchase volume of 
€100 million, depth sees an increase of 
€0.43 million in the full period. The fact 
that there is a close link between large cen-
tral bank purchases and market depth is in-
tuitive, on the one hand, as purchases 
should have a strong impact on the avail-
able depth in the order book of the inter-
dealer platform. The positive sign suggests 
that central bank purchases have contrib-
uted to greater resilience and have actually 
supported market- making activities. 
Amongst other things, this may be because 
the central bank’s presence as a reliable, 
major buyer in the market for Federal secur-ities gave rise to a certain degree of compe-
tition among market- makers to trade with 
the central bank.
In the early days of the PSPP , the opposite 
was the case: order book depth decreases 
with the purchase volume. This could indi-
cate that there was some adjustment effect 
to the purchase programmes over time and 
that the predictability of purchases also 
played a role for market participants.
Furthermore, the announcements of PSPP 
and PEPP cause the bid- ask spread to rise by 
just under 5 basis points (PSPP) and around 
7.5 basis points (PEPP) on the day of the an-
nouncement (see the lower section of the 
table above, panel A). However, depth in-
creases for the PSPP announcement and 
decreases for the PEPP announcement.Results of the difference-in-differences regressions*

Approaches to quantifying 
market conditions
A central factor for the market conditions and 
the benchmark status of the market for Bunds 
is the high market liquidity that it generally en -
joys, as this provides information on whether 
the market is functional at any given point in 
time. However, market liquidity is a multi-  
layered concept that cannot be viewed in isol -
ation by looking at individual indicators alone. 
A simultaneous analysis of different dimensions 
of trading activity is, in fact, crucial. The litera -
ture usually distinguishes between the four 
liquidity dimensions depth, width, immediacy, 
and resilience, which are explained briefly 
below. Depth measures the market’s ability to 
process the execution of large market orders 
for a security without this having a significant impact on its price. Possible indicators are the 
number and volume of buy and sell orders – 
both at the best bid and ask price and at lower 
order book levels. Width refers to the spread 
between the bid and ask prices in a market 
(bid- ask spread) or their relative distance to the 
mid- price (relative bid- ask spread). Width meas -
ures the transaction costs incurred when buy -
ing or selling a security. The “wider” the spread, 
the more expensive and thus illiquid the market 
is. Immediacy measures the time needed to 
execute a transaction of a certain size. The 
shorter the time period, the more liquid the 
market in question is. Possible indicators are 
“time to unwind”49 or, more generally, indica -
tors used to measure how long it takes to dis -Market liquidity 
is an essential 
component of 
a functioning 
marketLiquidity indicators deteriorated in response 
to the announcement effects on the ter-
mination of PSPP and PEPP purchases (see 
panel B in the table on p. 84). The bid- ask 
spread widens signifi  cantly upon the an-
nouncement of the exit from PEPP , whereas 
there is a slight narrowing on the day the 
exit from the PSPP was announced, al-
though this is weaker than the increase six 
months earlier and probably also due to 
general selling pressure in the context of 
higher interest rate expectations.
In both cases, order book depth recedes 
somewhat, but signifi  cantly only for the an-
nouncement of the termination of the PSPP . 
One factor in this could be that market par-
ticipants perceive the PSPP exit as putting 
an end to monetary policy purchase pro-
grammes and expect less trading activity in 
the future.
49 The time it takes to settle a US$5 million position – see 
Bank for International Settlements (1999). This measure is 
important in practice, but in the empirical analysis strongly 
depends on the data used and can therefore easily lead to 
inaccuracies in the calculation. It is therefore not used in 
the analyses on which this article is based.Deutsche Bundesbank

cover a security’s price.50 Resilience describes 
the speed at which a market returns to near 
“normal” market behaviour in the event of fluc -
tuations in key trading metrics (e.g. the security 
price) following a shock, for example in re -
sponse to new information or a large market 
order. Possible measures are ticket size51 or the 
market efficiency coefficient.52 In addition, this 
chapter also presents a new method for meas -
uring resilience for the Bund future market.
The actual trading volume is often used as an 
additional indicator of market liquidity. How -
ever, in some instances, a high trading volume 
correlates with a deterioration in other liquidity 
dimensions. Nevertheless, it is important for 
quantifying market conditions, as high trading 
volumes often indicate exceptional market situ -
ations.
Price volatility also has an important role to 
play in assessing market conditions. Periods of 
high volatility often point to increased uncer -
tainty among market participants in terms of 
their risk assessment for the security con -
cerned. Volatility can thus be an indication of 
market stress and is considered a measure of 
risk. However, it also occurs as new informa -
tion is priced into a security. Generally, volatile 
price developments up the risk for dealers and 
market-makers, which is why they sometimes respond by increasing the cost at which they 
provide liquidity (higher bid- ask spread) or by 
reducing their provision of liquidity (lower mar -
ket depth).
Finally, market conditions and inefficiencies can 
lead to (price) anomalies. For example, the Eu -
rosystem’s asset purchase programmes re -
duced the free float (see p. 75), causing a cer -
tain scarcity of many bonds. This can be seen, 
amongst other things, in rising scarcity premia 
in the repo market for Bunds that are particu -
larly sought after. Consequently, price differ -
ences between bonds which are otherwise 
broadly similar may become more frequent.53
One example of such price anomalies are yield 
deviations between ageing, originally long-  
dated Bunds and short- dated Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills) with the same residual maturity. 
Since 2017, these deviations have increasingly 
affected ask yields54 and, from 2020 onwards, 
are also more evident in mid yields.55 In an effi -
cient, frictionless market, if these bonds have 
the same residual maturity, they should also 
have the same yield. With the abolition of the 
maturity restriction (from a remaining maturity 
of 70 days) and the increase in the purchase 
limit under the PEPP , the ageing Bunds were in -
creasingly purchased, and have since then 
traded at higher prices than short- dated bonds 
with the same residual maturity. The shorter 
the residual maturity, the more pronounced the 
difference was. Before the start and at the be -Trading volume

52 The market efficiency coefficient measures the ratio be -
tween short- term and longer- term price changes: large 
short- term price changes accompanied by constant long-

and therefore point to decreasing liquidity; see Da Silva 
(2013).
53 This can be quantified, for example, using “spline 
spreads”, in other words, yield deviations from the esti -
mated yield curve. However, these can also increase due to 
shifts in the yield curve.

ginning of the PSPP , the relationship had been 
the reverse, i.e. the yield on Bubills was higher 
than the yield on ageing, originally long- dated 
Bunds, mainly because Bubills are more liquid. 
Regression analyses have been used to show 
that PEPP purchases now promoted the abnor -
mal56 yield spreads. Moreover, the higher issu -
ance volumes of Bubills from 2020 onwards are 
probably also a key reason why Bubills have 
higher yields in relative terms. Since the deci -
sion to end the PEPP in December 2021, the 
positive deviation of short- dated and ageing 
bonds with the same residual maturity has 
come back down again, and has even entered 
negative territory at times. However, it has risen again significantly over the course of 
2022.
The difference in the price of bonds with the 
same residual maturity but issued by agencies 
with the same default risk, such as the Federal 
Republic of Germany and Kreditanstalt für 
Wiederaufbau (KfW), could also point to cer -
tain scarcities in the market for Bunds. A small

may be fundamentally justified, for example, 
because Bunds have higher issuance volumes. 
This difference can be understood as a liquidity 
premium57 for KfW bonds as compared to 
Bunds. However, it has widened sharply of late, 
which illustrates the particularly high demand 
for Bunds and the scarcities that this has 
caused. Price anomalies between the Bund 
cash and the Bund future market, two very 
closely related markets, are examined in the 
box on pp. 79 ff.
The dimensions outlined above suggest that a 
comprehensive assessment of market condi -
tions must necessarily be based on a holistic 
approach encompassing a wide range of indi -
cators. At the same time, however, it is desir -
able to use as few indicators as possible to 
present market conditions in order to better 
understand and communicate the outcome. 
The wide- spread method of principal compon -
ent analysis58 can be employed to reduce the 
number of dimensions used to explain an em -
pirical situation without significantly curtailing 
the information content of the resulting com -
posite indicator. Indicators that can be used to 
measure market conditions empirically will 
therefore be presented below.
A principal component analysis can be used to 
calculate a liquidity score from the nine liquid -
ity indicators on the Bund cash, Bund future 
and SC repo market (see the table on p. 87).59 
By contrast, the level of intraday volatility is 
shown individually for the cash and the future 
market, as no aggregation is necessary. Devel -
opments in the four indicators of possible price 
anomalies can be clearly seen in their first prin -
cipal component.60 Moreover, all 15 indicators 
can be merged into a cross- segment composite 
indicator (overall market composite indicator, 
or MCI).61 The MCI thereby maps events in the 
three segments cash, Bund future and repo 
market on a daily basis. To make interpretation 
easier, all indicators are normalised to values 
between 0 and 100.The high- frequency indicators on the Bund fu -
ture market can be used to represent a com -
posite indicator (future market composite indi -
cator, or FCI) for which measured values are 
available for every second of trading. It is pri -
marily intended to allow an analysis of dynamic 
processes and developments on small time 
scales (for example, market reactions to the 
publication of economic data or monetary pol -
icy decisions) on an intraday basis.62 The possi -
bility provided by the FCI of examining short 
time scales is particularly important given that 
market conditions are heavily influenced by al -
gorithmic trading strategies.
Overall, the indicators (see the chart on p. 88) 
and the resilience indicator presented in the 
box on pp. 90 f. represent clear and comple -
mentary methods for quantifying market con -
ditions. They can help to bundle dynamic mar -
ket developments that are driven by numerous 
simultaneous factors and thus make them eas -
ier to understand and communicate. Essen -Holistic analysis

58 Principal component analysis is a statistical method that 
extracts common time- varying determinants from several 
correlated variables. Each determinant is a linear combin -
ation of the variables used. In most cases, only one or two 
common factors, known as the principal components, are 
considered, as these generally explain the majority of the 
total variance in all the variables included. See also 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2008).
59 The liquidity score is calculated from the first (46% of 
variance) and the second principal component (17% of 
variance), weighted by their empirical explanatory power. 
The first principal component is determined relatively 
evenly from all input variables – except trading volume. 
Trading volumes and other indicators are inverted in some 
cases so that low (high) values always represent good 
(poor) liquidity.
60 It represents 48% of the variance of the input variables.
61 The first principal component of the MCI represents 
45% of the variance of all individual indicators and is ex -
plained relatively homogeneously by all remaining indica -
tors. The second principal component represents 12%. The 
MCI is derived from the first and second principal compon -
ent weighted by their empirical explanatory power. Apart 
from the three inverted volume indicators, all individual in -
dicators are positively correlated. The volume indicators are 
key determinants of the second principal component.
62 With the exception of a few details, the model is de -
signed using the same procedure as for the first indicator. 
Important differences are the much larger amount of data 
available for the future markets (for two and a half years, 
data are available for around 14.7 million trading seconds), 
the smaller number of individual indicators that are incorp -
orated into the model (8 rather than 15) and the use of 
four principal components rather than two.Deutsche Bundesbank

A novel approach to measuring market resilience
When it comes to measuring market condi-
tions, resilience, as mentioned above, plays a 
special role. Resilience implies that, even dur-
ing periods of high market stress, market par-
ticipants can still make investment decisions 
without complications or interruptions to 
trading as part of a continuous trading pro-
cess. In resilient markets, shocks therefore do 
not cause disruptions with prolonged phases 
of illiquidity, but instead lead rapidly to a new 
steady state and to a level of trading activity 
that does not differ signifi  cantly from that of 
the previous days.
Quantifying resilience is a complex process 
that involves a degree of discretionary scope 
and for which there is no uniform standard. 
Below, we will introduce an empirical method 
for quantifying resilience in the Bund future 
market separately from the other indicators in 
order to more clearly communicate the exact 
procedure and to allow the results to be repli-
cated.1
To measure resilience, we look at the duration 
of particularly unusual market events accom-
panied by extreme fl  uctuations in securities 
prices.2 We examine how long the price 
changes persist outside their normal range 
following a strong price shock. The more re-
silient the market is to extreme price volatility, 
the faster trading activity should normalise 
and revert to the steady state after such a 
shock.3
The calculations produce a simple indicator 
that provides information with a high tem-
poral resolution on the market’s ability to 
“process” strong price fl  uctuations. For each 
time period, the value of the indicator shows 
how many seconds an extreme price event 
lasted on average.4 Here, a higher value 
equates to weaker resilience to price fl  uctu-
ations. The longer- term trend clearly shows 
the marked period of stress at the beginning 
of the COVID- 19 pandemic (in which the mar-
ket took an average of fi  ve seconds to nor-
malise again after an extreme event) and a 
further period of reduced resilience in Febru-ary 2021. Interestingly, in recent months, the 
resilience indicator has not pointed to a 
marked decline in market resilience. This can 
be interpreted to mean that the reduction in 
market liquidity for ten- year Bund futures cur-
rently measured by the overall market com-
posite indicator and the FCI has not yet had 
the same effect on resilience up until the sum-
mer as was the case at the start of the COVID- 
19 crisis.
1 Given the fast pace at which electronic markets re-
spond, the resilience study focuses on short time scales 
(frequency: one second), which helps gain a clearer 
picture of the observed rapid market fl  uctuations and 
dynamic development processes in the order books. 
The underlying data sample is the same as that used 
for the futures market composite indicator (FCI). The 
data sample runs from 17 January 2020 until 24 June 
2022. It contains data totalling around 15 million 
seconds of trading activity. These data are taken from 
normal German trading hours (9:00 to 17:45).
2 This method is based on Danielsson et al. (2018).
3 In order to identify extreme price events, we begin 
by calculating intraday volatility for each individual 
trading day since the beginning of 2020 based on the 
one- second price changes. The point at which an ex-
treme price change begins is defi  ned as the second in 
which the percentage price change is more than fi  ve 
times the standard deviation for that day. For simpli-
city, normal distribution is assumed for the underlying 
price changes at the one- second level. In this context, 
a 5- sigma price change represents an intense and rare 
event which, for example, occurred only 1,578 times 
within the 14.7 million- second time frame for the ten- 
year Bund future under review here. This means that a 
price movement such as this occurs approximately 
once every 9,500 seconds on average. In actual fact, 
however, extreme events tend to occur in clusters. Sev-
eral “calm” days without any extreme movements may 
then be followed by a short period featuring a particu-
larly large number of major price events (volatility clus-
tering). Starting from this moment, we analyse the 
price change over the next 60 seconds, measuring the 
time that price volatility takes to return to normal 
levels. As markets and liquidity change over time, this 
normal range is not static either. The limit of the nor-
mal range is defi  ned as a fi  ve- day moving median, 
+/- two standard deviations from the last four trading 
days prior to the event and on the day of the event it-
self and thus contains data from around 140,000 trad-
ing seconds. Each successive change in the price out-
side the defi  ned normal range counts toward the dur-
ation. This means that the duration indicates the 
length of the extreme event up to the point at which 
the price movements fi  rst return to normal.
4 The average duration of an extreme price event for 
ten- year Bund futures is 1.9 seconds. This means that,

tially, the indicators identify three periods in 
which market conditions have been tense since 
2019: the COVID-  19 crisis, the Ukraine war, and 
the increasing expectations of monetary policy 
normalisation as a result of the inflationary en -
vironment.
Developments in market 
conditions in an environment 
of heightened uncertainty
The COVID-  19 crisis
In the spring of 2020, the COVID-  19 pandemic 
dominated the capital markets and led to, in 
some cases, massive disruptions in many mar -
ket segments. As of 1 March 2020, yields on 
Bunds initially declined as risk aversion rose. 
This flight to safety is not unusual in uncertain 
times.63 However, starting on 9  March, ten-  
year Bund yields temporarily spiked up 75 basis 
points within the space of eight trading days,64 thereby displaying volatility that is many times 
higher than is usual for this asset class. In this 
uncertain environment, there were also repeat -
edly periods of high illiquidity. Such price dy -
namics are exceptional for a benchmark seg -
ment such as Bunds, especially given that yields 
were rising and not falling (as is more common 
in risk- averse periods). This episode illustrates 
that even market segments generally regarded 
as very robust, such as Bunds, are not immune 
to temporary market distortions.
The turmoil was largely triggered by a global 
supply shock in leading government bond mar -
kets owing to numerous sell orders from mar -
ket participants whose liquidity needs had shot 
up at short notice (dash for cash). A prime ex -
ample are foreign central banks, for whom 
Bunds constitute an important component of The COVID-  19

euro reserve assets. In March 2020, they sold 
an exceptional volume of Bunds, possibly in 
order to allow them to intervene more flexibly 
in the foreign exchange market should the situ -
ation escalate. However, Bunds were by no 
means the only market with benchmark status 
to experience the above-  described phenom -
ena. For example, a similar supply shock also 
led to a sharp drop in the liquidity of US Treas -
ury bonds.65 Moreover, as compared with the 
Bund market, the US Treasury market came 
under comparatively greater pressure.66 In re -
sponse, the Federal Reserve System absorbed 
considerable volumes of US Treasuries. On 
18  March 2020, the Eurosystem, too, an -
nounced, that it was responding to the pan -
demic by launching a temporary pandemic 
emergency purchase programme (PEPP) of pri -
vate and public sector securities, with an initial 
envelope of €750 billion. The announcement 
and start of purchases on 26  March 2020 
helped to calm the market.
Inflation and the war 
in Ukraine
After a period of around 16 months in which 
market conditions were robust, a new market 
phase started to emerge at the end of October 
2021. This was mainly due to the high degree of uncertainty about future interest rate devel -
opments in an increasingly inflationary environ -
ment, which was initially driven by global sup -
ply chain bottlenecks. In a zero interest rate en -
vironment, bonds are particularly sensitive to 
rising interest rates, which meant that investors 
were also very uncertain about the valuations 
of Bunds. As a result, liquidity conditions de -
teriorated.
In this situation, with supply chains already vul -
nerable and inflation rising, the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine had a multiplier ef -
fect. The rapid rise in energy prices and re -
newed shocks to global supply chains not only 
weighed on the capital markets, they simultan -
eously put pressure on large swathes of the 
real economy. Faced with the sharp deterior -
ation in the outlook for inflation over the me -
dium term, the ECB Governing Council initiated 
monetary policy normalisation in the euro area 
by ending net purchases under the APP and 
PEPP monetary policy purchase programmes 
and undertaking its first interest rate hikes.

rates as a result of the inflationary environment 
and the high level of uncertainty in the real 
economy were accompanied by a decline in 
liquidity in the cash and future market for 
Bunds.
Other selected indicators, such as repo market 
rates and asset swap spreads,67 are also dis -
playing signs of certain tensions in the trade in 
Bunds. In 2022, the scarcity premium in the 
repo market again hit the record level last seen 
in 2016 and 2017, when monthly PSPP pur -
chases were carried out at their maximum vol -
ume of €80 billion. One factor here was in -
creased risk aversion as a result of Russia’s war 
of aggression on Ukraine, which has signifi -
cantly buoyed demand for Bunds, another was 
adjusted market positioning by investors due to 
expectations of an interest rate hike.68 There is 
therefore nothing yet to suggest that the scar -
city issue will ease given the end of the APP 
and PEPP monetary policy purchase pro -
grammes. Asset swap spreads have also risen 
significantly, which may be due to demand for 
hedging interest rate risk given rapidly rising ex -
pectations of an interest rate hike and market 
uncertainty about the extent of monetary pol -
icy tightening. At the Governing Council meet -
ing on 8 September 2022, the deposit rate was 
raised to 0.75%. In order to prevent an abrupt 
outflow of deposits into the market and the as -
sociated collateral scarcity in some segments of 
the repo market, the ceiling for remuneration 
of government deposits with the Eurosystem 
was removed for a transitional period up to the 
end of April 2023. This adjustment contributed 
to a slight decline in asset swap spreads and 
the scarcity premium in the repo market in Sep -
tember.
The current environment and 
the COVID-  19 crisis compared
In contrast to developments in the COVID-  19 
crisis, where market conditions normalised sig -
nificantly after around two months, market 
conditions have remained tense ever since the summer, despite a moderate recovery in April 
and May 2022.69 Given this high degree of un -
certainty and illiquidity reached in recent 
months, one might think that market condi -
tions for Bunds currently bear similarities to the 
turbulent initial phase of the COVID-  19 pan -
demic.
However, a nuanced analysis of the situation 
shows that the market phase currently being 
observed differs substantially from the period 
from mid- February to end-  April 2020. In the 
first few days of the COVID-  19 crisis, the indica -
tors moved with significantly stronger momen -Scarcity premia

67 The asset swap spread is the difference between the 
interest rate swap rate and the yield on a bond with the 
same maturity. A Bund asset swap spread combines the 
purchase of a fixed interest Bund with an interest rate 
hedge using an interest rate swap and reflects not only de -
mand for interest rate hedging but also the general liquid -
ity situation, as Bunds are considered to be the most liquid 
bonds.
68 Numerous investors went short in the cash market as a 
bet on rising interest rates and financed these positions via 
the repo market.
69 An important event in this development was the Gov -
erning Council meeting on 9  June 2022, as a result of 
which the end of net purchases under the PSPP was an -
nounced and fresh signals of monetary policy tightening 
were given. Intraday indicators such as the FCI or the resili -
ence indicator show a very strong response from investors, 
which started immediately in the first few seconds after the 
announcement of the results of the Governing Council 
meeting (13:45 CET) and saw market conditions deterior -
ate sharply. In these first few seconds, the resilience indica -
tor also registered a particularly long 5- sigma price event, 
which lasted for 12 seconds.Deutsche Bundesbank

tum than the more gradual changes observed 
since October 2021, which have taken place 
over the course of several months. Moreover, 
during the COVID-  19 crisis, market liquidity, in 
particular, deteriorated amid only temporarily 
elevated volatility (see the overview of indica -
tors on p.  88). In the current environment, 
meanwhile, volatility and price anomalies are 
above the levels seen during the COVID-  19 cri -
sis, while liquidity is comparatively less tight. 
The observation that market conditions were 
subject to greater strain during the COVID-  19 
crisis than is the case in the current environment 
is further corroborated by a supplementary 
evaluation of the resilience indicator. Looking at 
the past few months, this indicator likewise 
suggests that the market has, when experien -
cing high volatility, remained subject to extreme 
volatility for longer periods of the day overall 
than was the case a year ago. However, looking 
at the average duration of individual extreme 
price events, it is clear that the market’s resili -
ence did not deteriorate significantly up until 
the summer of 2022 (see the box on pp. 90 f.). 
Overall, the COVID-  19 crisis therefore caused a 
more severe slump in market conditions, the 
scale and dynamics of which have not so far 
been matched during the current market phase.
Overall, the current market conditions should 
be seen in the context of the exceptional 
macroeconomic and geopolitical develop -
ments. As the associated uncertainties fade, 
market conditions for Bunds should pick up 
again.Conclusion and outlook
Looking at Bunds, market conditions in general 
and market liquidity as a significant component 
have changed, not least as a result of the Euro -
system’s monetary policy purchases. Analyses 
suggest that the central bank’s net purchases 
may hurt the market liquidity of Bunds. This is 
particularly true if purchases are carried out 
over a long period of time and on a large scale. 
Central bank measures to mitigate undesirable 
side effects, such as securities lending, can 
then only partially compensate for these nega -
tive effects.
The sudden crises of the past two and a half 
years, the considerable uncertainty about fu -
ture inflation developments and, most recently, 
the transition to a positive interest rate environ -
ment have also caused certain tensions in mar -
ket conditions for Bunds and the market seg -
ments directly linked to them. Similar observa -
tions have also been made in other countries, 
such as the leading market for benchmark 
bonds, the United States.
At least some of the described stress factors are 
likely to recede over time. A central bank’s con -
tribution is to keep medium-  term inflation ex -
pectations well anchored. Looking forward, the 
Eurosystem is also likely to reduce its holdings 
of Bunds again – as other central banks are al -
ready doing  – thus helping to raise the free 
float.The current, 
exceptional 
market environ -
ment puts 
impairment 
of market 
conditions  into 
perspective Future market 
conditions 
depend on 
developments in 
the market 
environment as 
well as on cen -
tral bank activity 
and structural 
factors

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections as of 2020 Q1. Until 2019 Q4 these are compiled using Solvency I
supervisory data, supplemented by voluntary reports and own calculations.  1 Including
deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans
and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension funds on pension managers
and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical reserves "life" taking account oftransitional measures. Health insurance is also included in the "non-life insurance"
sector.  4 Own funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other
equity".  5 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by primary insurers, which
is included there.  6 Valuation at book values. The term "pension funds" refers to the
institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of Accounts. Pension funds
thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational pension schemes for the
self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  7 Change in data sources.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland,
Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were
used.  2 Includes countries belonging to the group EER-19 and additionally Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico,Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB suspends
the publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against
Russian rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation
of effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from
that date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of
Russia in conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to
the US dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 in-
cluding Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta,
from 2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia,
from 2015 including Lithuania) as well as Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  5 Euro area countries (current
composition) and countries belonging to the group EER-19.  6 Euro area countries (cur-
rent composition) and countries belonging to the group EER-42.
