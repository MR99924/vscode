Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is likely to have con -
tinued on its steep growth path in the third 
quarter of 2017, albeit with slightly less mo -
mentum than in the first half of the year. While 
brisk industrial activity remains an important 
driver of growth, as in the first half of the year, 
the economic indicators show that at the start 
of the third quarter it was somewhat more 
moderate than the continuing buoyant mood 
among industrial enterprises would imply. 
Nevertheless, the persistently high level of new 
industrial orders dampened of late only by a 
– presumably temporary – lack of large orders, 
the continued extremely buoyant construction 
activity, the exceptionally upbeat sentiment 
among consumers and the undiminished sub -
stantial growth in employment are testament 
to a very good economic situation.
Industry
Industrial activity recovered in July from its 
short but significant setback of the previous 
month and returned to the upward trend seen 
since the beginning of the year. In July, indus -
trial output was up by a seasonally adjusted 
¼% on the upwardly revised June level; it was 
thus slightly higher than the average of the 
second quarter. While output of intermediate 
goods rose significantly (+1%), producers of 
capital and consumer goods suffered some 
small setbacks (-½% and -¼% respectively). 
Holiday effects, which are often responsible for 
severe fluctuations in the summer months, 
clearly did not play a key role this year.
In July, industrial orders fell by ¾% in season -
ally adjusted terms on the month. The principal 
dampener was the low level of large orders, 
with orders otherwise up ½% in seasonally ad -justed terms. Overall, the inflow of new orders 
slightly exceeded the average of the second 
quarter (+¼%) and excluding large orders was 
up a clear 1½%. In regional terms, the lack of 
large orders was evident primarily in orders 
from the euro area, where there was a signifi -
cant decrease overall compared with the aver -
age of the second quarter (-2%). By contrast, 
domestic orders (+¾%) and orders from non-  
euro area countries (+1%) were clearly up on 
their average volume in the second quarter. In 
the breakdown by sector, orders for intermedi -
ate goods and capital goods expanded by 1% 
and ¼% respectively, while the inflow of orders 
for consumer goods contracted sharply follow -
ing the steep growth in the second quarter 
(-2¾%).
Compared with June, industrial sales decreased 
by ¼% in seasonally adjusted terms, falling 
back to the average level of the preceding 
quarter. While sales to domestic customers 
were down, turnover with counterparties from 
the euro area and non-  euro area countries in -
creased. Nominal exports of goods rose slightly 
on the month (+¼%) but were still significantly 
below the average of the second quarter 
(-1¼%). After the elimination of price effects, 
the decline was more moderate. By contrast, in 
terms of value, the imports of goods posted a 
very steep month- on- month increase (+2¼%), 
also clearly surpassing the level of the second 
quarter after adjustment for price effects.
Construction
In July, construction output rose by a seasonally 
adjusted ½% on the month, which was none -
theless slightly short of the average level in the 
second quarter (-¼%). Activity in the main con -
struction sector contracted distinctly compared 
with the second quarter (-¾%), with the de -
crease impacting both general construction 
and civil engineering. By contrast, output in the German econ-
omy remains on steep growth path in Q3 2017

finishing trades increased markedly (+½%). 
New orders in the main construction industry in 
the second quarter – the last period for which 
figures are available – fell by a seasonally ad -
justed 2½% compared with the high level of 
the first quarter. Nevertheless, a sustained wide 
range of orders, a persistently high number of 
building permits, a record high assessment of 
the current situation and improving expect -
ations indicate buoyant construction activity.
Labour market
Employment continued its steep ascent at the 
beginning of the third quarter. In July, the sea -
sonally adjusted number of persons in work 
overall in Germany went up by 42,000 on the 
month. The year- on- year rate of increase, at 
1.6% or 698,000 persons, was exceptionally 
steep. The extremely favourable overall devel -
opment is predominantly driven by the on -
going expansion in employment subject to so -
cial security contributions. However, the refer -
ence value of +809,000 employees for the 
same month one year earlier –  the estimate 
here referring to June  – has a slight upward 
bias.1 By contrast, the number of persons work -
ing exclusively in low- paid part- time jobs has 
been in decline for some time now. The num -
ber of self- employed persons, which had also 
fallen previously, seems to have stabilised of 
late, however. Leading indicators of the de -
mand for labour such as the Ifo employment 
barometer, the Federal Employment Agency’s 
BA- X job index or the labour market barometer 
of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) 
are all at a very high level, suggesting the posi -
tive job growth is set to continue in the next 
few months.Strong increase 
in employment; outlook remains favourableEconomic conditions in Germany *

Deutsche Bundesbank1 This is based on figures for employment subject to social 
security contributions being underreported for June and 
July 2016 owing to a processing error in the registration of 
jobs subject to social security contributions at the Federal 
Employment Agency. According to the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, although the figures from August last year 
onwards were corrected in spring 2017, the revision of 
June and July 2016, the first two months affected, is not 
planned until a later point in time.Deutsche Bundesbank

In August, seasonally adjusted unemployment 
was only marginally down on the month. There 
were 2.53 million persons registered as un -
employed with the Federal Employment 
Agency, with the unemployment rate holding 
steady at 5.7%. Compared with the same 
month one year earlier, 139,000 fewer persons 
were out of work, and the unemployment rate 
was 0.4  percentage point lower. The un -
employment component of the IAB labour 
market barometer moved close to the neutral 
threshold recently, which means that a more 
sideways movement is to be expected in the 
next few months.
Prices
In August, crude oil prices were up by just over 
4½% on the previous month’s level. This was 
due not only to expectations of a reduced sup -
ply, but at times also to production losses and 
lower inventories. Crude oil prices went up fur -
ther in the first half of September. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$55½, with crude oil 
futures  now being traded at a slight discount.
Import prices fell further in seasonally adjusted 
terms in July. Energy prices increased but the 
importing of other goods became distinctly 
cheaper against the backdrop of the marked 
appreciation of the euro. By contrast, the 
strengthening euro had hardly any impact on 
industrial producer prices, which were up 
slightly both in aggregate terms and excluding 
energy. The year- on- year figure fell to 1.9% 
overall in the case of import prices and re -
mained approximately constant at +2.3% in 
the case of industrial producer products sold 
domestically.
Consumer prices (HICP) continued to rise in Au -
gust, increasing by 0.1% in seasonally adjusted 
terms. Non- energy industrial goods became 
more expensive, mainly due to a significant in -
crease in clothing prices with the introduction 
of new collections. There was no decline in the prices of other non- energy industrial goods, 
despite the steep appreciation of the euro. En -
ergy and food prices went up only slightly over -
all. In the case of services, marked reductions in 
the prices of travel services were largely offset 
by other services becoming more expensive. 
Annual headline HICP inflation increased from 
+1.5% to +1.8% (with CPI also up from +1.7% 
to +1.8%), while HICP inflation excluding 
energy  and food held steady at +1.5%. In the 
autumn, headline inflation is likely to fall tem -
porarily, mainly reflecting base effects, but core 
inflation is set to pick up gradually.
Public finances
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
Overall, the statutory health insurance (SHI) 
scheme posted a slight surplus of almost €½ 
billion in the second quarter of 2017, compared 
with a deficit of €½ billion in the same period 
last year. A financial improvement was seen in 
both areas of the scheme. The health insurance 
institutions, still experiencing much weaker 
than expected expenditure growth, increased 
their surplus by €½ billion on the year, while 
the health fund reduced its deficit by just under 
€½ billion thanks to a continued rise in contri -
bution receipts. The health fund made special 
transfers – which are to be drawn from its re -
serves – totalling €½ billion, primarily to the 
health insurance institutions.
The health insurance institutions’ revenue, 
which mainly consists of transfers from the 
health fund, rose by 4½%, while growth in 
their expenditure (+3½%) was, by contrast, 
perceptibly lower. Above all, the major expend -
iture items pharmaceuticals (+2½%) and hos -
pital treatment (+3%) increased only moder -
ately. In addition, less significant items such as 
sickness benefit also saw disproportionately 
low spending growth, with home nursing even 
experiencing a substantial decline. On the 
other hand, the rise in outlays on remedies and Registered 
unemployment remains at low level

therapeutic appliances (+6%) and outpatient 
treatment (+5%), among other items, was 
above average.
The health fund’s total revenue and its contri -
bution receipts both increased by 5% (with the 
average additional contribution rate remaining 
unchanged). This was because, on aggregate, 
the expansion in gross wages and salaries re -
mained strong and the particularly large pen -
sion increase in mid-2016 continued to affect 
the rise. With growth of 3½%, the planned in -
crease of €½ billion per year in the central gov -
ernment grant (to its new standard level of 
€14½ billion per year) also made an impact. At 4½%, growth in expenditure lagged behind 
that in revenue.
For 2017 as a whole, the scheme’s finances 
look likely to be in better shape than projected 
by the group of statutory health insurance esti -
mators last autumn. In view of the sharp in -
crease in contribution receipts, the health fund 
should post a significantly better result than the 
estimated deficit of €2 billion. As things stand, 
expenditure growth will probably also be mark -
edly weaker than forecast last autumn (+5%). 
Consequently, instead of a balanced budget 
the health insurance institutions are set to re -
cord a distinct surplus again. At present, the 
statutory health insurance scheme as a whole is 
probably also benefiting on balance from the 
considerable increase of just over 1% in the 
number of insured persons. A sizeable portion 
of this rise is accounted for by immigrant work -
ers, a group with a financially advantageous 
age structure. All in all, the health insurance in -
stitutions, at least, can be expected to continue 
building up their reserves. Even disregarding 
the special grant paid this year, this will allow 
the institutions more scope to reduce add -
itional contribution rates. Rate cuts would not 
only lessen the burden on insured persons but 
would also make it easier for the health insur -
ance institutions and legislators to refuse fur -
ther demands from providers.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
finished the second quarter of 2017 with a def -
icit of €½ billion in the core area.2 This 
amounted to a deterioration of €½ billion on 
the year, due mainly to the benefit expansions 
brought in under the second Act to Strengthen 
Long- term Care (Pflegestärkungsgesetz II).  As a Strong contribu-
tion receipts improve health fund’s financesFavourable financial

has taken the receipts from 0.1 percentage point of the

ter of 2017) and transferred them to this fund.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2017

result, the additional revenue generated by the 
contribution rate rise3 of 0.2 percentage point 
was not sufficient to offset the scheme’s sub -
stantial cost increases.
While revenue increased very sharply (by 
13½%) in view of the contribution rate rise,4 
expenditure growth was much stronger still 
(+22½%). The impact of the substantial spend -
ing increases triggered by the reformed range 
of benefits can be seen in all benefit areas. 
Outlays on benefits in kind, a particularly large 
expenditure item, rose by 15%, while the less 
significant item monetary benefits saw growth 
of 45½%.
The benefit expansions introduced under the 
second Act to Strengthen Long- term Care ap -
pear to be driving up spending without a sub -
stantial time lag. As things stand, the extremely 
strong expenditure growth can be expected to 
continue through to the end of the year, which 
means that a significant operational deficit is 
likely to be recorded for 2017 as a whole. Aside 
from the recent expansion of benefits, strong 
cost pressures are set to emerge as a result of 
demographic change. Consequently, further 
contribution rate rises are foreseeable once the 
freely available portion of the long- term care 
insurance institutions’ operational reserves5 is 
fully depleted, if not before. Although the 
transfers to the long- term care provident fund 
are to be terminated in 2035 and its accumu -
lated reserves subsequently run down, this will 
only moderately curb the necessary contribu -
tion rate rises.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €86.0 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in July 2017 was slightly up on the 
June figure (€77.3 billion). However, after tak -
ing account of increased redemptions and 
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own debt 
securities, the outstanding volume of domestic bonds declined by a net €17.3 billion after al -
ready having contracted by €1.1 billion in June. 
The outstanding volume of foreign debt secur -
ities in the German market, on the other hand, 
rose by €9.8 billion, which meant that the out -Substantial

standing volume of domestic and foreign debt 
instruments in Germany decreased by €7.4 bil -
lion on balance.
The public sector redeemed own bonds total -
ling €18.2 billion net in the reporting month. It 
was mainly central government that reduced its 
capital market debt (€16.6 billion), redeeming 
primarily ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) total -
ling €15.8 billion. This contrasted with net issu -
ance of five- year Federal notes (Bobls) to the 
amount of €3.0 billion. State and local govern -
ments redeemed bonds with a net value of 
€1.6 billion.
German credit institutions reduced their capital 
market debt by €7.2 billion in July. In particular, 
the outstanding volume of other bank debt se -
curities that can be structured flexibly fell by 
€3.0 billion. There were also net redemptions 
of debt securities issued by specialised credit in -
stitutions (which include public promotional 
banks, for example) as well as mortgage Pfand -briefe (to the tune of €2.2 billion and €2.1 bil -
lion respectively). By contrast, public Pfand -
briefe worth €0.2 billion net were issued.
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises placed debt securities worth €8.2 billion 
net on the market. On balance, this was largely 
attributable to non- financial corporations. 
Other financial institutions also issued new 
bonds, however.
The Bundesbank was the main buyer of debt 
securities in July, acquiring a total net €11.6 bil -
lion worth of bonds, not least under the Euro -
system’s asset purchase programmes. Domes -
tic non- banks expanded their bond portfolios 
by €5.9 billion. The focus of buyer interest here 
was on foreign securities. By contrast, foreign 
investors sold bonds for €18.4 billion net. Ger -
man credit institutions likewise offloaded debt 
securities worth €6.5 billion net. These were 
largely domestic securities.
Equity market
In the month under review, shares totalling 
€0.5 billion net were issued in the German 
equity market. The majority of issues emanated 
from listed enterprises. Sales of foreign shares 
in Germany totalled €2.2 billion in the same 
period. Domestic non- banks in particular dom -
inated the buyers’ side of the market, adding 
shares worth €4.5 billion net to their portfolios. 
By contrast, non- resident investors and domes -
tic credit institutions sold equities in the amount 
of €1.0 billion and €0.7 billion net respectively.
Mutual funds
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded inflows 
of €9.7 billion, the lion’s share of which was 
received by specialised funds reserved for insti -
tutional investors (€5.2 billion). Of the various

tate funds (€1.4 billion) and bond funds (€1.2 
billion), albeit to a lesser extent. Foreign mutual 
funds sold shares totalling €3.9 billion net in 
the German market. On balance, domestic 
non- banks were virtually the only purchasers of 
mutual fund shares in the reporting month 
(€12.1 billion). Foreign investors and German 
credit institutions acquired mutual fund shares 
worth €0.9 billion and €0.7 billion net respect -
ively.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €19.4 billion in July 2017. The result was 
€5.6 billion down on the level of the previous 
month. This was caused in around equal meas -
ure by declines in both the goods account sur -
plus and the invisible current transactions bal -
ance comprising services as well as primary and 
secondary income.
The July surplus on the goods account was 
€2.8 billion down on the month at €22.2 bil -
lion. Exports of goods fell more strongly than 
imports of goods.
The balance of invisible current transactions, 
which had been balanced in the previous 
month, fell by €2.8 billion in July to a deficit of 
the same. This was mainly due to the services 
account deficit growing by €2.4 billion to €3.8 
billion. On the one hand, this was caused by 
the usual seasonal increase in travel expend -
iture; on the other hand, however, the high 
level of receipts from IT and other business ser -
vices in the previous month could not be main -
tained. Net expenditure in secondary income 
also rose. In this case, the deficit widened by 
€0.8 billion to €4.4 billion, mainly due to lower 
general government revenue from current 
taxes on income and wealth of non- residents. 
The slight increase in the primary income sur -
plus of €0.4 billion to €5.4 billion in the report -
ing month narrowed the deficit to a degree.Current account

In July, the international financial markets were 
characterised by robust global economic activ -
ity and the market expectations surrounding 
monetary policy in the euro area and the 
United States in particular. Against this back -
drop, German cross- border portfolio invest -
ment generated net capital exports of €33.4 
billion. More than half of these outflows were 
attributable to net sales and redemptions of 
domestic securities (€18.6 billion) held by non- 
resident investors. Much of this amount was 
accounted for by bonds (€15.9 billion), and by 
public sector bonds in particular. Furthermore, 
non- residents offloaded money market instru -
ments (€2.5 billion) and shares (€1.1 billion), 
though they acquired a small volume of invest -
ment fund shares (€0.9 billion). Domestic in -
vestors topped up their portfolios of foreign 
securities (€14.8 billion). They mostly invested 
in bonds (€9.2 billion), but also took up invest -
ment fund shares (€3.9 billion), shares (€1.1 bil -
lion), and money market instruments (€0.6 bil -
lion).
In direct investment, net capital exports of €0.3 
billion were recorded in July. New investment 
abroad by domestic enterprises (€3.2 billion) 
was attributable to an increase in equity cap -
ital, with reinvested earnings also playing a role 
(€1.2 billion). Lending to affiliated enterprises, on the other hand, turned negative in July 
(€1.2 billion) on account of a reduction in trade 
credits (€2.1 billion). Foreign direct investors 
supplied their affiliates in Germany with funds 
totalling €2.9 billion. This was done through 
the provision of additional equity capital (€1.9 
billion) as well as credit facilities (€1.0 billion) – 
and only using loans, with reduced trade 
credits.
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments, saw net capital 
imports of €16.6 billion in July. In this context, 
German claims on non- residents (€23.4 billion) 
fell more sharply than liabilities (€6.9 billion). It 
was commercial banks above all that saw cap -
ital inflows (€16.9 billion net), while enterprises 
and individuals recorded €1.1 billion. General 
government likewise posted net capital imports 
(€3.6 billion). By contrast, net capital exports 
(€5.0 billion) were predominant at the Bundes -
bank. While TARGET2 claims fell slightly in July, 
by €4.3 billion, there was also a decline in the 
Bundesbank’s liabilities, which more than made 
up for this.
Measured at transaction values, the Bundes -
bank’s reserve assets rose by €0.5 billion in July.Capital exports

Monetary policy indicators at the lower 
bound based on term structure models
Making appropriate monetary policy decisions is predicated on reliable information about the 
monetary policy stance. To this end, monetary policy indicators measure the extent to which 
monetary policy is expansionary or restrictive and form the basis for analyses examining the 
effect of monetary policy on the real economy and inflation. A short- term interest rate is typically 
used here as it serves as the starting point for policy rates.
However, in response to the financial and sovereign debt crisis, the Eurosystem set out to preserve 
price stability not only by cutting policy rates but also by adopting a set of expansionary non-  
standard measures. As increasing use was made of these unconventional measures, the informa -
tive value of the short- term interest rate as a monetary policy indicator diminished over time and 
led to a growing need for alternative indicators. This applies to the monetary policy asset pur -
chase programmes, in particular, as they are aiming to lower longer- term interest rates now that 
the lower bound on short- term interest rates has been reached.
Monetary policy indicators that take into account such measures can, in principle, be calculated 
using term structure data in conjunction with appropriate theoretical models. Examples from the 
latest research are the “shadow short rate”, the “crossing time” and the “effective monetary 
stimulus”. They are presented in this article and discussed with respect to their information con -
tent and benefit to monetary policymakers. All in all, it is clear that deriving and estimating these 
indicators is fraught with a high degree of uncertainty. Nevertheless, all individual indicators sug -
gest that the measures undertaken by the Eurosystem have enabled it to achieve an even more 
accommodative monetary policy stance.
Although monetary policy indicators are used to evaluate the monetary policy stance, it is impos -
sible to establish by means of these indicators alone whether this monetary policy stance is 
appropriate. In view of this, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy takes into account a num -
ber of economic, price, credit and financial indicators that can be interpreted in terms of their 
implications for the medium- term inflation outlook and that ultimately make it possible to gauge 
the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In response to the financial and sovereign debt 
crisis, the Eurosystem has, since 2007, set out 
to preserve price stability not only by cutting 
policy rates but also by adopting a set of non- 
standard measures designed to counteract the 
negative impact on the financial system and 
macroeconomic developments. Prior to June 
2014, the primary objective of these measures 
was to safeguard the functioning of the mon -
etary policy transmission process; however, 
given the subdued medium- term inflation out -
look and with market- based inflation expect -
ations falling, the Eurosystem subsequently 
made further cuts to monetary policy rates and 
undertook a series of further non- standard 
measures with the explicit aim of achieving an 
even more accommodative monetary policy 
stance.1
These measures included the launch of two 
series of targeted longer- term refinancing op -
erations (TLTROs), the asset- backed securities 
purchase programme (ABSPP) and the third 
covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), as 
well as the launch of the expanded asset pur -
chase programme (APP) in January 2015. The 
last of these includes not only the pre- existing 
ABSPP and CBPP3 but also the subsequently 
launched corporate sector purchase pro -
gramme (CSPP) and the public sector purchase 
programme (PSPP), the most significant pro -
gramme in terms of purchase volume. In De -
cember 2016, the ECB Governing Council de -
cided to continue conducting asset purchases 
under the APP until December 2017, or beyond, 
if necessary, and in any case until the Govern -
ing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the 
path of inflation consistent with its inflation tar -
get. In doing so, its aim is to achieve inflation 
rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium 
term.
It is crucial for monetary policymakers to be 
able to assess the impact of their measures on 
an ongoing basis and thus gauge the appropri -
ateness of the monetary policy stance. For this purpose, they need to be able to measure the 
monetary policy stance in as close to real time 
as possible. Prior to the financial crisis, this was 
reflected fairly well in short- term interest rates. 
Furthermore, in order to assess appropriate -
ness, changes in short- term interest rates were 
interpreted together with additional economic, 
price, credit and financial indicators with re -
spect to their implications for the medium- term 
inflation outlook. However, a landscape in 
which non- standard monetary policy measures 
feature heavily makes measuring the monetary 
policy stance a far more challenging task. This 
is especially true if monetary policymakers find 
themselves at the lower bound and therefore 
move away from changing policy rates, focus -
ing instead on employing unconventional 
measures in an attempt to shift the monetary 
policy stance.
This article presents a selection of alternative 
indicators for measuring the monetary policy 
stance and discusses their respective strengths 
and weaknesses. Given the key role played by 
long- term interest rates in monetary policy 
transmission and the focus of significant non-  
standard monetary policy measures on longer- 
term interest rates, the indicators presented 
here are based on term structure information 
– in other words, on interest data at differing 
maturity dates. Building on this, this article re -
veals the extent to which, in the context of the 
measures adopted by the Eurosystem in the 
low- interest- rate environment, these indicators 
signal a change in the monetary policy stance 
over time.

formation on the future path of the inflation 
rate if they are to assess the current monetary 
policy situation. Given the long and varying 
time lags in monetary policy and incomplete 
knowledge of potential changes in structural 
relationships in an economy, this information 
(and what it means for price developments) is 
particularly uncertain. The Eurosystem’s monet -
ary policy strategy therefore focuses on broad- 
based analyses of the inflation outlook and in -
corporates a number of economic, price, credit 
and financial indicators that can be interpreted 
in terms of their implications for the medium-  
term inflation outlook.
Second, central banks need indicators that en -
able them to directly assess the impact of their 
policies. It is typically assumed that there is a 
close link between the use of monetary policy 
instruments and general financing conditions, 
as well as a link between the latter and eco -
nomic developments.2 In simplified terms, 
monetary policymakers signal a change in the 
monetary policy stance by revising policy rates. 
In doing so, they steer current short- term inter -
est rates and shape expectations about how 
they will move in future. This, in turn, has an 
impact on long- term interest rate develop -
ments and, as a result of changes in general 
financing conditions, the macroeconomic en -
vironment and loan dynamics, too. As a result, 
the short- term interest rate is usually con -
sidered a sufficiently informative indicator for 
measuring the monetary policy stance and 
therefore typically has broad theoretical and 
empirical applications in the analysis of monet -
ary policy effects.3
Against the backdrop of the financial and sov -
ereign debt crisis, the informative value of the 
short- term interest rate as a monetary policy 
indicator has diminished. This was caused, in 
particular, by using non- standard monetary 
policy measures in an environment in which 
the scope for further policy rate cuts became 
increasingly constrained by the lower bound. 
For instance, some of the unconventional 
measures aim to shape the expected path of short- term interest rates, reduce the maturity, 
credit risk or liquidity risk premiums priced into 
longer- term interest rates or even improve 
banks’ financing situation by means of targeted 
long- term refinancing operations, thereby rais -
ing the credit supply.
The PSPP’s specific objective is to reduce yields 
on long- term bonds by lowering the term pre -
miums demanded by market participants for 
assuming interest rate risk (“duration chan -
nel”).4 Going beyond that, the Eurosystem is 
announcing and conducting asset purchases 
with the expectation that market participants 
will regard these moves as an indication – in 
addition to forward guidance regarding the 
future  policy rate path – that the Eurosystem 
plans to maintain its accommodative monetary 
policy stance and, in particular, low short- term 
interest rates for a prolonged period (“signal -

Term structure modelling 
at the lower bound
Analysing interest rate movements along the 
yield curve provides valuable information on 
the impact of monetary policy measures. Using 
term structure models, it is possible to investi -
gate how policy rate changes and unconven -
tional measures targeting the entire yield curve 
affect interest rates for different maturities. The 
models can provide information on the extent 
to which observed interest rates are shaped by 
market participants’ actual interest rate expect -
ations and what proportion of interest consti -
tutes compensation for taking risk.5 In particu -
lar, it is possible to use term structure models 
to measure the monetary policy stance by con -
densing information derived from interest 
movements into individual indicators, thereby 
consolidating it.
Even prior to moving into this phase of low 
interest rates, affine – ie linear – term structure 
models had been widely established as a stand -
ard model for yield curve analysis at many cen -
tral banks.6 These models describe the dynam -
ics of the yield curve under the condition of 
no arbitrage7 using several factors that, in prin -
ciple, cannot be observed. These “latent fac -
tors” are not precisely set out in economic 
terms; in other words, it is not possible to 
exactly determine the economic context in 
which they are linked to the term structure. 
However, they must possess certain statistical 
properties (and it is often possible to draw con -
clusions about economic relationships in retro -
spect based on the pattern they follow over 
time).8 Using these latent factors, it is possible 
to describe the yield curve very precisely, with 
two to three such factors usually proving suffi -
cient for this purpose. The variation of interest 
rates for different maturities is consolidated 
into several factors by means of statistical pro -
cedures and put to use in term structure model 
estimates. In this context, interest rates are aff -
ine functions of these factors – that is to say, 
they are assumed to be in a linear relationship with them. Interest rate expectations can be 
generated by forecasting factors.
Given the assumption of linearity, affine term 
structure models implicitly assume that interest 
rates and interest rate expectations can, in 
principle, be negative to any possible extent. 
The lower bound therefore constitutes a prob -
lem for this type of term structure modelling 
since the actual course of interest rates calls 
this linearity assumption into question. In add -
ition, due to the fact that interest expectations 
can adopt values below the lower bound, this 
has implications for the modelling of expect -
ations regarding future interest rate move -
ments. Furthermore, it is assumed in affine 
models that interest rate volatility is constant 
over time. At the lower bound, however, short- 
term interest rates, in particular, are likely to re -
main at that level and thus be less variable than 
in phases in which the interest rates are clearly 
above the lower bound.9
Against this background, the use of lower 
bound models to analyse interest rate dynam -
ics along the maturity spectrum has become 
increasingly widespread in recent years. This 
model class takes account of the behaviour of Analysing

5 Depending on the type of security, risk premiums are de -
manded to cover, in particular, the risk of an unexpected 
change in future short- term interest rates and unexpected 
inflation developments, but also the risk of a payment de -
fault or inability to sell quickly in the event of declining 
market liquidity.

short- term interest rates in a low- interest- rate 
environment outlined above by introducing a 
shadow short rate and a lower bound (see the 
box on pages 18 to 22 and further information 
on page 24 ff).10 It is assumed that the shadow 
short rate corresponds to the short- term inter -
est rate that is actually observed, provided the 
latter is above the lower bound.11 If the short- 
term interest rate remains at the lower bound, 
the shadow short rate falls below it as per its 
linear relationship with the statistical factors. 
The expected path of short- term interest rates 
therefore also depends on the probability of 
the expected shadow rate lying above or below 
the lower bound. Accordingly, the distribution 
of possible realisations of the expected short-  
term interest rate is restricted to values above 
the lower bound, which is key to the plausible 
modelling of interest rate expectations at the 
lower bound. As a result, the lower bound af -
fects the distribution of future potential interest 
rate realisations well before the lower bound is 
actually reached. This effect is amplified as 
interest rate expectations converge towards 
this lower bound.
The adjacent chart shows recent interest rate 
movements in the euro area based on the over -
night index swap (OIS) yield curve.12 OIS inter -
est rates are based on swap contracts in which 
two parties agree to exchange a fixed interest 
rate for a series of floating rates. These floating 
rates are indexed to the EONIA rate.13 As only 
the interest payments linked to a nominal 
amount that is to be determined are exchanged 
at the end of the contract, OIS contracts usu -
ally bear very little or no counterparty risk. Due 
to this characteristic, the contracts are not used 
as a store of value, which means that their 
prices cannot even be driven by flight to quality 
in favour of very safe and liquid forms of invest -
ment in times of crisis – a move that can, for 
instance, be observed in the prices of govern -
ment bonds, which are considered safe havens. 
Above all, however, one side of the contract, 
namely the variable interest rate, is closely 
linked to the Eurosystem’s policy rates, as the 
EONIA closely tracks the main refinancing rate in normal times and the deposit facility in times 
of high levels of excess liquidity.14 This means 
that the OIS yield curve contains largely un -
biased information about expectations priced 
in along the term structure regarding future 
monetary policy measures.OIS interest rates

environment of remarkably low interest 
rates close to zero, lower bound models have become established as extensions of 
Gaussian affi   ne multifactor models.1 Lower 
bound models make it possible to model the path of the short- term interest rate in 
such a way that it does not fall below a pre-scribed lower bound.
Similarly to the various Gaussian models, 
lower bound models assume that, on con-
dition of no arbitrage, the dynamics of the 
term structure can be described using sev-
eral infl  uencing variables (unobservable or 
observable), which are stacked as “factors” 
in the vector Xt and follow a linear vector 
autoregressive law of motion. Two different 
probability measures are assumed for this 
law of motion in the model: the risk- neutral 
probability measure Q  and its counterpart, 
the historical probability measure P, which 
generates the actual variation in interest 
rates.2
When using the risk- neutral probability 
measure,
Xt=µQ+φQXt1+⌃✏t, (1)
applies, where /u1D716t is a standard normal dis-
tributed (Gaussian) error term, µ is a con-
stant, /uni03D5 is a matrix that describes the correl-
ation of the factors with their own past val-
ues, and Σ  is a parameter matrix which 
determines the dispersion of the error terms. Under the historical probability 
measure, the factors follow the law of mo-tion
Xt=µP+φPXt1+⌃✏t. (2)The short- term one- period shadow short 
rate, sit, is an affi   ne – ie linear – function of 
these very factors, for which
sit=0+0
1Xt. (3)
applies. The observable short- term interest 
rate i1,t corresponds to this shadow interest 
rate, as long as the shadow short rate lies 
above the (potentially time- varying) lower bound lb
t. If it falls below this bound, the 
observable short- term interest rate is equal 
to the lower bound:
i1,t=max (sit, lb t). (4)
The non- linear link between the short- term 
interest rate and the shadow short rate in equation (4) is used to ensure that the short- term interest rate is not able to fall 
below the lower bound. At the same time, the expected path of the short- term interest 
rate can be shown to remain at this lower 
bound for an extended period of time, pro-
vided that the shadow interest rate is ex-pected to fall below this bound over a 
longer period of time (see the chart of the 
estimation results on page 21). The expected 
path of the observable short- term interest

weight certain future scenarios depending on their at-titude towards risk, meaning that different dynamics of 
factors are assumed when determining securities prices (Q  measure). The difference between the dy-

dynamic of the forward premiums.Deutsche Bundesbank

rates therefore depends on the probability 
of the expected shadow interest rate lying 
above or below the lower bound. The ex-
pected short- term interest rates follow a 
truncated distribution accordingly, restricted 
by the lower bound.3 Spot rates with ma-
turity n result from a non- linear function 
depending on the factors Xt together with 
the function terms of the equations (1), (3) and (4)
in,t=gn(Xt;µQ,φQ,⌃,δ0,δ1, lbt). (5)
Although this function does not have an 
analytical solution, interest rates can be de-termined using an approximation of the im-
plied one- period forward rates.4 They then 
represent the average of the implied for-
ward rates

Term and forward premiums are the differ-ence between the spot interest rates or for-
ward rates derived from the model, calcu-
lated in each case using the coeffi   cients es-timated under the risk- neutral and historical probability measures.
This box presents the estimated results of such a lower bound model for the euro 
area.5 The model is specifi  ed using three la-
tent factors and uses monthly OIS rates based on the EONIA rate, with a residual maturity of between one month and ten 
years, for the period from January 1999 to August 2017. The path of the lower bound 
is directly prescribed for the model in the form of the path of the Eurosystem’s de-
posit facility rate.6
To be able to identify more precisely the model parameters under the historical 
probability measure used to determine the 
model- implied interest rate expectations and the long- term interest rate level, add-itional survey- based interest rate forecasts 
are taken into account in this specifi  cation.7 
For this purpose, the model- implied interest rate forecasts are matched with survey data 
of concurring maturities and augmented 
with a measurement error between the two 
variables, which means that, although a certain convergence of interest rate fore-casts from the model and the surveys is

The motivation for incorporating survey data 
is the fi  nding from the literature that the models are often estimated with data sets 
that cover too narrow an observation period to suffi   ciently determine the actual variation 
of interest rates, measured against the very 
high persistence of interest rates with few 
interest rate cycles. This can sometimes pro-
duce the estimated results for the medium 
and long maturities, according to which the change in interest rates can be almost exclu-sively attributed to changes in the term pre-miums, while the long- term interest rate ex-
pectations move only marginally.9 At the 
same time, very little information about the 
long- term level of the expected short- term interest rate is provided for a model esti-mated using a data set characterised by a persisting period of low interest rates close 
to the lower bound as well as low volatility, 
as is the case in the euro area.10 If, on the 
other hand, interest rate expectations are 
linked to the survey data, the model is able 
to use this additional information to describe the expected interest rate changes more pre-
cisely. With this in mind, the estimates in-
corporate both short and long- term survey- 
based interest rate forecasts.11
The chart on page  21 depicts the model- generated path of the short- term interest 
rate in March 2016 and in August 2017. For 
the fi  rst of the two dates, it can be seen that 
the expected shadow short rate was mark-
edly negative until July 2019 due to the (ex-
pected) persistence of factors, but the short- term interest rate path remained constrained 
by the lower bound due to the truncated 
distribution characteristic. Therefore the 
asymmetry of the distribution of the short- 
term interest rate also becomes apparent, as its most likely path (modal path) has re-
mained signifi  cantly below its expected path. As a result, market participants con-
sider the most likely outcome to be that the 
short- term interest rate will remain at the 
lower bound for over 2.5 years before grad-ually increasing. The path of the short- term 
interest rate in August 2017 is compatible 
with an interest rate path scenario in which the December 2016 decision of the Govern-
ing Council of the ECB will be fully imple-
mented, followed by a subsequent tapering 
phase, and in which, in line with forward guidance, the deposit facility rate will only subsequently be raised. The model estima-
tions imply that the short- term interest rate will remain at the lower bound for just over 
another 1.7 years before experiencing a 
gradual increase.
8 Survey- based expectations are only an approximate 
refl  ection of market price expectations. On the one 
hand, this may be due to the low number of survey 
participants; on the other hand, though, it may be ex-
plained by the potential variations in the information 
available to participants and the point in time at which 
they submit their answers. Alternatively, therefore, it can be assumed that the subjective expectations of survey participants deviate from the objective statis-
tical expectations held under the historical probability 
measure P. For more information, see also M Piazzesi,

interest rate expectations falling short and excessively 
high risk premiums. See also F Geiger and F Schupp

With regard to the longer- term maturity 
segment, the chart on page 22 shows the 
model- generated decomposition of the 
fi  ve- year, fi  ve- year forward rate into the average path of the expected short- term interest rates and forward premium com-
ponents. A high degree of the variability of 
the forward rate can be explained by the change in the forward premium,
12 which 
can be seen in particular to have declined markedly in the wake of the “Greenspan conundrum”
13 between June 2004 and 
June 2006 and again in anticipation of 
widespread asset purchases since the be-
ginning of 2014, and to have remained 
negative since then.
However, the longer- term model- implied interest rate expectations have also proven to be time- varying, and have tended to be lower since the height of the fi  nancial and 
economic crisis in 2008. In order to be able to pass judgment on the economic plausibil-
ity of the level and the variability of the ex-
pected short- term interest rates in the longer- term forward rates (and therefore 
also on the forward premiums, indirectly), it 
may be advisable to perform a comparison of the expectations component with an 
equilibrium nominal short- term interest rate 
in the medium to long term derived from a 
macroeconomic model. The interest rate ex-pectations contained in the fi  nancial market prices at the long end of the term structure should position themselves at this level if it is 
assumed that the term structure refl  ects macroeconomic information, particularly with regard to long- term infl  ation expect-
ations and the equilibrium real interest rate. 
The latter is determined by estimating a nat-ural rate of interest which is consistent in the longer term with a permanently closed out-put gap and a stable infl  ation rate following the easing of all cyclical fl  uctuations.

eral Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, No 775. 
The authors use all available survey data for interest, in-
fl  ation and economic developments in the United States, and come to the conclusion that most of the variation in interest rates is driven by changes in the term premiums. 
Macroeconomic demand shocks, in particular, may ex-
plain the development of term premiums.
13 This “conundrum” was referred to in a speech by 
former US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, in order to 
illustrate the apparent breakdown of the conventional 
relationship between short- term and long- term inter-
est rates in the United States during the period of in-
creasing interest rates between 2004 and 2006. The 
increases in the federal funds rate were not initially 
transmitted to the long- term interest rates, which even declined slightly. For an account of this phenomenon, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank, Globalisation and monet-
ary policy, Monthly Report, October 2007, p 29.

Measuring the natural rate of interest: International 
trends and determinants, Journal of International Eco-
nomics, 108, Supplement 1, pp  59-75. The maturity 
perspective of the derived natural rate of interest in this model estimation is not explicitly defi  ned, but refers to a 
longer- term perspective due to the modelling strategy 
and the defi  nition of the latent variable and shock pro-cesses: “Our defi  nition takes a ‘longer- run’ perspective, in that it refers to the level of real interest rates expected 
to prevail, say, fi  ve to 10 years in the future, after the economy has emerged from any cyclical fl  uctuations 
and is expanding at its trend rate”. See T Laubach and J C Williams (2016), Measuring the natural rate of inter-est redux, Business Economics, 41, pp 57-67.Model-implied paths of short-term interest rates

Indeed, the longer- term interest rate ex-
pectations derived from the lower bound model capture the level and path of the nominal natural interest rate rather well, 
the latter in the period under review being 
primarily driven by the real natural interest 
rate path amid simultaneously stable long- 
term infl  ation expectations. This observa-tion is interesting in that the two models 
have no information directly in common in 
the estimates. While the term structure 
model solely contains term structure infor-
mation, the macroeconomic model only takes the infl  ation rate, the level of gross domestic product and the ex- ante short- 
term real interest rate into consideration in 
its estimates.15 Long- term forward rates 
thus appear to refl  ect trends in key macro-
economic variables in both real and nom-
inal terms, which play an important role in 
the formation of longer- term interest rate 
expectations.1615 For more detailed information on the estimation of 
the natural interest rate in the euro area, see Holston 
et al (2017), op cit. As the natural rate of interest is 
estimated in real terms, this rate is extended in the 
chart to include long- term infl  ation expectations (Con-
sensus Economics’ average infl  ation expectations 
stand at six to ten years), making it possible to directly compare it with the nominal interest rate expectations of the term structure model.16 For more on this topic, see also R K Crump, S Eusepi

Yield curves in the government bond markets 
are less closely linked to the deposit facility 
rate, as the market participants active in these 
markets – most notably large institutional in -
vestors – do not have access to the Eurosys -
tem’s deposit facility. This is especially true of 
large institutional investors that are non- banks. 
As a result, some safe haven government 
bonds with short and medium- term maturities 
have, in recent years, generated yields well 
below the OIS curve at times. This has been 
observed in periods of high risk aversion result -
ing from safe haven investment strategies and, 
in particular, since, in a move that was partly 
anticipated, the deposit facility was abandoned 
as the lower bound for PSPP purchases.15 The 
disparity between interest rates at the short 
end has led to the yield curve of safe haven 
bonds sometimes containing information that 
differs from the OIS curve. The indicators pre -
sented here are therefore also dependent on 
the choice of yield curve. For reasons of con -
sistency, all indicators are estimated on the 
basis of the OIS yield curve in the following 
paragraphs, even though it would also be rea -
sonable to estimate some of them based on 
government bonds considered safe.
In the light of the lessons learned from interest 
rate developments in the United States and the 
widespread view that nominal short- term inter -
est rates cannot fall far below zero due to the 
possibility of holding cash, a large number of 
model variants assume a fixed lower bound of 
(close) to zero.16 In actual fact, however, it has 
been shown not least by developments in the 
euro area that it was also possible for short-  
term money market rates to fall below zero in 
line with the gradual lowering of the deposit 
facility rate to -0.40%. Even more pronounced 
was the move into negative territory for short- 
term Bunds when, in February 2017, the yields 
on Bunds with a maturity of one year hit a low 
of -0.95%. These securities are obviously at -
tractive despite negative interest rates. This is 
probably driven not only by the cost of holding 
cash (eg storage costs, insurance etc) but also 
by regulatory and institutional aspects.If the deposit facility rate for the OIS market 
constitutes a de facto  binding lower bound, 
this means that the central bank’s perceived 
willingness to further cut policy rates also plays 
a role. Consequently, the effective lower bound 
could then be reached as soon as the central 
bank –  in the eyes of market participants  – 
takes the view that it would not be expedient 
to make further interest rate cuts due to the 
undesirable side effects of such a move running 
counter to the actual expansionary intention of 
the policy rate cuts.17
Overall, it is evident that the effective lower 
bound perceived by market participants is influ -
enced by a variety of factors and also may 
change with these over time.18 This does not 
call the existence of a de facto  binding lower 
bound in question, however, as it is still as -
sumed that this is reached either when the cost 
of holding cash is exceeded or there is an ex -
pectation that the central bank will consider 
the positive net effects of further interest rate 
cuts to have been exhausted.Yield curves of 
government bonds can also be used to derive monetary policy indicators

ance sector, as well as the investment behaviour of inter -
national, public sector entities, eg in the context of cur -
rency management, ensure that there is high structural 
demand for government bonds with a high credit rating.

Monetary policy indicators 
for the euro area derived 
from the yield curve 
Lower bound models make it possible to derive 
plausible interest rate expectations in a low-  
interest- rate environment. In addition, various 
indicators that are especially suited to measur -
ing the monetary policy stance in a low-  
interest- rate environment can be derived from 
these models. The following part of the article 
presents the “shadow short rate”, the “crossing 
time” and the “effective monetary stimulus” 
(EMS). They are all determined using informa -
tion derived from the entire yield curve. As a 
result, each of these indicators incorporates 
not only term premiums but also expectations 
regarding the future path of short- term interest 
rates. In terms of the suitability of these indica -
tors for measuring the monetary policy stance, 
however, one caveat to be noted is that yield 
curve developments can only be steered to a 
certain extent, and indirectly, through monet -
ary policy – in other words, changes in the in -
dicators do not only show changes in the mon -
etary policy stance. Other major determinants 
are, in particular, real economic developments 
and international interest rate linkages.19
The shadow short rate
From an economic perspective, the shadow 
short rate can be interpreted as the short- term 
interest rate that would materialise in the mar -
ket without a lower bound. Such an interpret -
ation seems intuitive, especially as the shadow 
short rate corresponds to the short- term inter -
est rate for as long as it is above the lower 
bound. This concept is based on the assump -
tion that investors can, in principle, also store 
their funds in cash to avoid significantly nega -
tive interest rates (cash option). As it is not pos -
sible to borrow or invest at this rate, it cannot 
be observed and does not have a direct impact 
on the financing conditions of the private sec -
tor. The shadow short rate is, therefore, a 
hypothetical interest rate resulting from an esti -mation of the yield curve, taking into account 
the value of the cash option. The cash option 
is, likewise, a theoretical concept which can 
only be estimated on the basis of theoretical 
assumptions. For this purpose, option pricing 
theory is used and combined with information 
from the yield curve.20
As a rule, it is possible to estimate the shadow 
rate in lower bound models on this basis. In 
order to ensure that the shadow rate is plaus -
ible in economic terms and can be used as an 
indicator of the monetary policy stance at the 
lower bound on interest rates, an appropriate 
bar has to be set for the specification of the 
lower bound model. Choosing the specification 
involves a trade- off of sorts between two ob -
jectives. The first objective is for the estimation 
to provide a good explanation for the observed 
interest rate developments and to obtain plaus -
ible interest rate expectations. The second ob -
jective is to generate an –  unobservable  – 
shadow short rate derived from the model (in 
other words, one that truly cannot be explained 
by the empirical model) as an indicator of the 
monetary policy stance at the lower bound.21 
The number of latent factors used in the model 
and the determination of the lower bound, in 
particular, affect the level and the dynamics of 
the shadow short rate.
The chart on page 26 illustrates this by compar -
ing shadow short rates derived from different Shadow short

right to invest his financial resources in cash at an interest 
rate of 0%, thus circumventing negative interest rates. The 
cash option is a purely hypothetical contract.

model specifications. One of the model vari -
ants is based on a less flexible specification 
with only two factors. The derived shadow 
rates are determined both for a lower bound of 
-0.4% and one of 0%, which is relatively high 
compared with the actual movement of short- 
term interest rates. This, in turn, means that the 
part of the yield curve which runs below this 
lower bound does not need to be described by 
the model and the few factors in this lower 
bound mainly depict the long end of the yield 
curve. This means that the shadow short rate 
primarily reflects the dynamics of long- term 
interest rates in the form of a linear combin -
ation of factors. In other words, the more 
strongly the shadow short rate reflected ob -
servable short- term interest rates, the more dif -
ficult it would be to deviate downwards from 
the lower bound. The changes in the shadow 
rate are therefore linked to the points in time 
when non- standard measures were announced, 
and a change in the shadow rate indicates a 
change in the monetary policy stance.22 On the 
other hand, information on actual movements 
in the short and medium- term segments is not 
taken into account in some cases, especially 
when the short and medium- term interest rates 
derived from the model run along a compara -
tively high lower bound. Consequently, monet -
ary policy measures, such as lowering the de -
posit facility rate, which mainly has an effect up 
until the medium- term segment, are only par -
tially captured by the shadow short rate.
By comparison, opting for a model with three 
factors and a lower (and more plausible) lower 
bound on interest rates of -40 basis points bet -
ter describes the yield curve as a whole.23 The 
high estimation quality ensures that the interest 
rates running above the assumed lower bound 
can be adequately described and the estimated 
interest rates do not fall below the lower bound. 
However, the model no longer allows the 
shadow rate to be noticeably below the lower 
bound. On the contrary, this has eliminated the 
sharp deviation of the shadow rate from the 
observed short- term interest rate (see the chart 
on page 26). As a result, the option of interpret -ing the shadow short rate as an information 
variable for non- standard monetary policy 
measures geared towards the long end of the 
curve is largely lost. As with the analysis of the 
short- term interest rate, this would effectively 
not show any changes in the monetary policy 
stance since mid-2011 and the non- standard 
measures would, accordingly, not be adequately 
reflected in the shadow rate. In the context of a 
specification with only two factors, the shadow 
rate thus provides a better picture of the impact 
non- standard measures have on the capital 
market as the shadow rate is more closely inter -
linked with the path of long- term interest rates. 
In addition, the shadow rate in these model 
classes is a great deal more robust to the choice 
of lower bound.24
The higher estimation quality of a three- factor 
model is imperative, however, if plausible ex -
pectations regarding the path of short- term 
interest rates and certain characteristics of 
interest rate movements at the lower bound 
are to be determined. To be applied in this way, 
the greater ability to forecast interest rates of 
the model with three factors is more import -
ant, whereas the dependence of the actual 
shadow short rate on the specification and pa -
rameterization of the model used is less import -
ant.
Overall, it is evident that the level and path of 
the shadow short rate react very sensitively to 
the respective model specifications. Against 
this background, the shadow short rate should 
ultimately only be interpreted as a qualitative 
indicator since its estimated level is difficult to Lower bound

22 See J Wu and F Xia (2016), op cit. The authors estimate 
a monetary policy VAR by replacing the federal funds rate 
with the shadow short rate as a monetary policy variable 
for the years during which the zero lower bound was bind -
ing in the United States.
23 The lower bound is based here on the lowest level of 
the Eurosystem’s deposit facility rate, which in the euro 
area is regarded as the floor for the unsecured interbank

model.
Crossing time and expected 
interest rate path
The non- standard monetary policy measures, 
including the asset purchase programmes, as 
well as the communication on future policy 
rate developments, which the Governing Coun -
cil of the ECB has linked to the duration of the 
APP , aim, amongst other things, at lowering 
the long- term interest rate by tweaking the ex -
pected course of short- term interest rates.25 
Correspondingly, the monetary policy stance is 
also reflected in market expectations regarding 
the path of short- term interest rates. The dur -
ation for which the observable short- term 
interest rate remains at the lower bound and 
the point in time when it goes back above a 
certain threshold (crossing time), can, there -
fore, potentially also be used as a measure of 
the monetary policy stance. Taken in isolation, 
the further down the line crossing time occurs, 
the more accommodative the monetary policy 
stance becomes as it indicates the expectation 
that policy rates will remain at a lower level for 
an extended period of time.The crossing time can be defined as the median 
of a large number of short- term interest rate 
paths simulated on the basis of a term struc -
ture model, ie the time when the short- term 
interest rate goes back above the 0% thresh -
old, indicating that short- term interest rates are 
returning to normal.26 The chart on page 27

crossing time since January 2015 based on a Crossing time

25 According to its forward guidance, the Governing 
Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their 
present levels for an extended period of time, and well past 
the horizon of the net asset purchases (see M Draghi, intro -
ductory statement to the ECB’s press conference on 20 July 
2017 in Frankfurt am Main). Regarding the effects of mon -
etary policy communication in the context of non- standard 
measures, see also G  Coenen, M  Ehrmann, G  Gaballo, 
P Hoffmann, A Nakov, S Nardelli, E Persson and G Strasser 
(2017), Communication of monetary policy in unconven -
tional times, ECB Working Paper No 2080.
26 The crossing time is determined by means of a Monte 
Carlo simulation by simulating several thousand paths of 
the expected short- term interest rate based on an esti -
mated term structure model. For each path, the point in 
time when it exceeds a specific pre- defined level (in this 
case 0%) is recorded. Often, the path is required to remain 
above this level for a certain amount of time (eg 12 
months) before the time is recorded. The median of the 
distribution of crossing times (lift- off distribution) deter -
mined in this way corresponds to the optimal forecast, as -
suming that market participants wish to minimise their ab -
solute forecast error. In the vast majority of cases, the me -
dian corresponds to the date when the modal path, ie the 
most likely path of the shadow rate, too, exceeds the de -
termined threshold. Deviations are possible, but should be 
limited in each case. Alternatively, the crossing time pre -
sented here could therefore also be calculated in connec -
tion with determining the modal path. See M Bauer and

lower bound model, which, due to its specifi -
cations, is capable of describing with the great -
est possible precision the term structure and 
the associated interest rate expectations (de -
tails on the model specifications can be found 
on pages 18 to 22). After the markets, at the 
beginning of 2015, had expected interest rates 
to return to positive territory within a median 
period of two years, this period continuously 
grew larger as time passed following the deci -
sion to introduce the APP in January 2015 and 
to further cut the deposit facility rate. Evidently, 
the Eurosystem was able to credibly communi -
cate a prolonged period of low short- term 
interest rates. At its peak in July 2016, the indi -
cator showed an expected return of the inter -
est rate to above 0% by July 2019, ie within a 
space of just over three years. As time pro -
gressed and against the backdrop of the yield 
curve steepening in the autumn of 2016, the 
crossing time moved closer again and is cur -
rently envisaged for mid-2019.
In contrast to the hypothetical concept of the 
shadow short rate, the crossing time, in its 
function as a monetary policy indicator, meas -
ures expectations about future observable de -
velopments. The crossing time can, therefore, 
also be verified empirically in retrospect. At the 
same time, however, the crossing time is de -
fined only at the lower bound and becomes 
uninformative as soon as the short- term inter -
est rate rises above the selected threshold 
value. Neither does it give any indication as to 
whether market participants expect a gradual 
or rapid increase in the short- term interest rate. 
It therefore makes sense to introduce an add -
itional indicator to the analysis in order to 
measure the expected pace of monetary policy 
tightening.27 The lower graph of the above 
chart thus shows the path of the short- term 
interest rate deemed the most likely by market 
participants over a period of two years once it 
has gone back above the 0% threshold. Since 
2015, this figure has remained stable between 
0.8 and 1.0  percentage point. This implies, 
ceteris  paribus,  that the rise in short- term inter -
est rates expected by market participants has been more subdued than, for example, be -
tween October  1999 and October 2000 or be -
tween December 2005 and June 2007, when 
the Governing Council of the ECB increased its 
policy rates by 2.25 and 2 percentage points 
respectively.
A further weakness of the crossing time de -
fined here as an indicator of the expansiveness 
of monetary policy is that it is not able to show 
the impact of monetary policy measures which, 
besides the expected path of short- term inter -
est rates, also have an effect through term pre -
miums. However, these effects can be cap -
tured, amongst other things, by the conditional

taining not only pure interest expectations but 
also an extra term premium.28
The chart on page 29 shows this distribution at 
different points in time between May 2014 and 
January 2015, when the Governing Council 
adopted its first TLTRO series and asset pur -
chase programmes, as well as in August 2017. 
The individual sub- graphs illustrate how the 
term premiums initially decreased steadily, 
which is reflected by narrowing distribution 
and a flattening OIS forward rate for one-  
month contracts (see also pages 18 to 22). In 
August 2017, distribution significantly ex -
panded again, which went hand in hand with 
the forward rate becoming steeper and could 
be regarded as an indication of monetary pol -
icy rates being expected to normalise. Overall, 
it appears that, by introducing the APP and for -
ward guidance, the Eurosystem has managed 
to reduce the uncertainty about future interest 
rate developments and the associated risk pre -
miums. In particular, these measures have tem -
porarily caused forward rates to drop consider -
ably.29
The effective monetary 
 stimulus
The effective monetary stimulus (EMS) aims to 
provide summarised information on the devel -
opment of forward rates, bundled in the form 
of a single indicator for measuring the monet -
ary policy stance. To this end, the EMS uses the 
“neutral” interest rate, which evens out in the 
long term, as a benchmark to put the path of 
the forward rate into perspective. The EMS is 
defined as the negative value of the integral 
between this neutral interest rate and the for -
ward rate curve.30 In other words, it compares 
two interest rate concepts, one of which aims 
to capture the current financing conditions on 
the capital markets and the other the long-  
term equilibrium level of interest rates for the 
economy as a whole. The farther the forward 
rate curve lies below the neutral interest rate, 
thus pushing down the EMS, the higher the measured degree of monetary policy accom -
modation. This means that the EMS’s direction 
of impact is defined in the same way as short- 
term interest rates. The EMS is defined both for 
normal times and for periods in which interest 
rates move along the lower bound.
Accordingly, the volume of the EMS depends 
largely on the level of the neutral interest rate, 
which can, in principle, be estimated using dif -
ferent modelling approaches as follows. The 
neutral interest rate could, say, be approxi -
mated directly from an estimated lower bound 
model as the interest rate towards which the 
forward rate (or the expected short- term inter -
est rate) converges in the very long term.31 Al-
ternatively, it could be derived from an esti -
mated macroeconomic model as an equilib -
rium interest rate which is compatible with a 
permanently closed output gap and a stable 
inflation rate.32 Besides the associated model 
uncertainty, the neutral interest rate is difficult 
to determine from an empirical perspective, 
too, not least because it is necessary to define 
the output gap as precisely as possible to ob -
tain an exact estimation. Accordingly, deter -
mining the EMS is, in many respects, contin -
gent on estimation quality and the ability to 
identify unobserved indicators; it is, therefore, 
particularly fraught with uncertainty.Distribution

28 This short- term interest rate is calculated as the ex -

probability measure that, in addition to actual expect -
ations, also incorporates a yield spread relating to the un -
certainty regarding the future interest rate path (term pre -
mium). If Jensen’s inequality term is taken into account as 
well, the future average of this interest rate corresponds to 
the forward rate with the same maturity.

Another approach is to use survey data. Ac -
cording to simple growth theory models, real 
interest rates are essentially determined by the 
rate of real economic growth.33 What follows 
from this is that nominal growth expectations 
stemming from surveys could be used as a dir -
ectly observable variable in determining a nom -
inal EMS.34 Although growth expectations from 
surveys, too, contain an element of forecasting 
uncertainty, they do not depend on the as -
sumptions made as part of a specific lower 
bound or macroeconomic model and are, 
therefore, likely to be more robust to model 
variations.
In such a model- free variant, the EMS is de -
fined as the difference between a long- term 
interest rate and long- term nominal growth ex -
pectations from surveys and can thus be deter -
mined based on observable indicators without 
using a term structure model.35 In the model-  
based variant, the EMS is the integral of the 
difference between a model- implied forward 
rate and long- term nominal growth expect -
ations.36
The model- based estimation of the EMS allows 
the indicator to be decomposed into its individ -
ual parts. Assuming the expectations hypoth -
esis of the term structure, the EMS component 
which is attributable to expectations of risk-  neutral market participants can be deter -
mined.37 Similarly, the EMS component result -
ing from the existence of term premiums, 
which risk- averse market participants demand 
for taking on maturity risks relating to long-  
dated bonds, can be determined as well.

be estimated in term structure model or deter-mined through model- free  calculationModel- based calculation allows decom-

lar for yields of differing maturities; see A Halberstadt and 
L Krippner (2016), op cit.
36 Given the high estimation quality of the term structure 
model, the interest rates and forward rates derived from 
the estimated model are almost identical with the observed 
interest rates and forward rates. Based on the same neutral 
interest rate, the model- free variant of the EMS is equiva -
lent to the model- based variant, with the exception of the 
extent of the measurement bias regarding interest rates.

Analysis of the impact of monetary policy shocks on 
 macroeconomic variables using the effective monetary stimulus indicator
Empirical studies on the impact of monetary 
policy measures conventionally use a short- 
term interest rate as a benchmark for the monetary policy stance as this forms the 
link with monetary policy rates. Such stud-
ies are often carried out using vector auto-regressive models.
For instance, in a vector autoregressive model, the impact of monetary policy is generally estimated by analysing the re-
sponse (eg in the form of impulse response 
functions) of variables that are of interest, 
such as the output gap and infl  ation, to a 
monetary policy shock (ie an unanticipated change in the monetary policy stance). The 
use of an exogenous shock makes it pos-
sible to separate the impact of the monet-
ary policy measure from the endogenous 
effects caused by other factors.1
Such model estimates can generally be used 
to demonstrate that an increase in short- 
term interest rates causes output and infl  a-
tion to fall. In a period of persistently low interest rates close to the lower bound where unconventional measures are used, 
such estimates are no longer suffi   cient and 
more detailed monetary policy indicators, such as the effective monetary stimulus 
(EMS), are required.
The EMS is defi  ned as the negative value of 
the integral between a neutral interest rate and the forward curve. It uses two interest rate concepts – one to capture the current fi  nancing conditions on the capital markets and the other to capture a long- term equi-librium level for the economy.
2 In this analy-
sis of the impact of monetary policy on Ger-
man industrial production and price devel-opments3 using the framework of a small 
vector autoregressive model with time- 
varying parameters, we have thus opted to use the EMS as an indicator for the monet-
ary policy stance as this refl  ects both con-
ventional and unconventional monetary policy measures.
4 A further major advan-
tage of using the EMS as opposed to alter-native indicators, eg a shadow interest rate, 
is that it can be determined based on ob-
servable indicators without having to use a term structure model.
5 An unobservable in-
dicator such as a shadow short rate would imply additional uncertainty for the analysis

as it is already estimated with uncertainty 
itself.6
The observation period spans the years 
from 1999 to 2015 – and thus both a period 
of purely conventional monetary policy 
(1999-2008) as well as the subsequent period in which unconventional measures were taken. In a vector autoregressive 
model, the statistical properties of a monet-
ary policy shock change if the EMS is used 
as the monetary policy variable instead of 
the short- term interest rate. If the short- 
term interest rate is used, shocks are much 
smaller in the unconventional phase be-
cause it remains at the lower bound, and 
the low volatility, too, yields only small non- 
deterministic movements. However, in the 
case of the EMS, the statistical properties of the derived shocks are very similar through-
out the observation period. This applies to 
both the size of the shocks and their per-sistence. In recent years, when an EMS 
shock has occurred, the impact thereof has lasted for a similar length of time as at the 
beginning of the monetary union (see also 
the chart on page 32).
But a key criterion for the quality of a mon-
etary indicator is, above all, whether it cap-
tures all the information needed. The EMS 
indicator includes, inter alia, information on term premiums and the market participants’ expectations about the future development 
of short- term interest rates. The central 
bank can only control these two elements 
indirectly and to a limited extent. Thus, a 
change in the indicator value or in the mon-etary policy shock under analysis can, gen-
erally speaking, be attributable to factors 
other than just the central bank’s intention to change the monetary policy stance.
However, the conventional practice of using 
a short- term interest rate as a monetary 
policy indicator in the application of a small vector autoregressive model also has disad-
vantages. For instance, even in the case of 
conventional policy rate management, the 
long end of the yield curve and thus the 
long- term fi  nancing conditions that gener-
ally drive investment decisions within the 
economy are infl  uenced not only by monet-
ary policy but also, to a certain degree, by 
other factors, such as the national real eco-
nomic setting or the international environ-
ment. Therefore, the more closely the short- 
term interest rate is linked to the develop-
ment of long- term interest rates, the more 
complete a picture of monetary policy transmission it is likely to paint. Thus, it is not only the EMS but also the short- term interest rate that are merely proxies for a monetary policy indicator that must be examined in each case to determine 
whether it is fi  t for use in practice.
With the EMS as a monetary policy indica-
tor, the model results for both the period 
before the fi  nancial crisis – when short- term 
yields were still well above zero – and the 
period of low interest rates are more plaus-ible than when a short- term interest rate is 
used. This is particularly evident in the im-
pulse responses of the macroeconomic vari-
ables to a monetary policy shock. If the 
EMS is used as a monetary policy indicator, prices and industrial production in Germany 
fall as expected in the medium term in re-
sponse to an increase in the EMS (see the 
chart on page 34); however, if the short- term 
interest rate is used, this is not the case.7 
6 The shadow short rate is an unobserved, hypothet-
ical interest rate. The estimate thereof also hinges 
heavily on the modelling assumptions. The EMS indica-
tor is more robust but is also dependent on the natural interest rate selected (see p 28f); see L Krippner (2015),

For large stretches of the observation 
period, these falls are also statistically sig-
nifi  cant, but not for the period of low inter-est rates. In the latter’s case, the estimated 
declines in both industrial production and 
prices are weaker and statistically insignifi  -
cant.
The estimate shows, moreover, that the macroeconomic variables are signifi  cantly 
infl  uenced only if unanticipated changes in the EMS indicator are considered as a whole 
– ie including the expectations and term premium components into which the 
model- based EMS indicator can be decom-posed.
8 In this aggregated view, both chan-
nels are required for the transmission of un-
conventional monetary policy measures to 
the overall economy.
The results of the analysis are similar for 
both the estimate with German macroeco-
nomic data and that with corresponding euro area aggregates. If alternative indica-
tors for macroeconomic activity and infl  a-tion are used for the estimate, the model 
results are by and large similar, thus indicat-ing that they are robust.

The volatility of the EMS has changed only 
slightly since 1999 (see the chart on page 34).38 
The decline in the EMS since 2008 reflects an 
easing of the monetary policy stance through 
non- standard measures. These measures are 
not always announced exactly at the same time 
as changes in the indicator value occur. If the 
measures had previously been expected in the 
market, this would have already become evi -
dent through the development of the indicator 
value in the run- up to the announcement. Con -
sequently, the significant decline in the EMS in 
the course of 2014 can also be explained by 
increased market expectations concerning a 
broad- based government bond purchase pro -
gramme.
Similar to the other indicators discussed here, 
the EMS is not able to provide information on 
the adequacy of the monetary policy stance ei -
ther, not least because the neutral interest rate 
used here does not take account of determin -
ants which are key to economic developments 
and thus also to achieving the monetary policy 
objective of price stability. These determinants 
and, by extension, also the concept of the neu -
tral interest rate are, however, hard to identify 
empirically.39 The information content of the 
absolute level of the EMS and thus the differ -
ence between current and neutral interest rates 
is, therefore, at best, as reliable as an estima -
tion of the neutral interest rate.
On the assumption that any potential estima -
tion error in the neutral interest rate is largely 
constant over time, the change in the EMS can, 
however, serve as an indicator for measuring 
changes in the monetary policy stance and may 
be useful for monetary policy analysis (see the 
box on pages 30 to 32).
Concluding remarks
On the basis of term structure data and models, 
it is possible to obtain meaningful indicators for 
measuring the monetary policy stance, even at 
the lower bound and when non- standard mon -etary policy measures are deployed. However, 
conclusions regarding the expansiveness of 
monetary policy based on individual indicators 
are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Fur -
thermore, any interpretation of the develop -
ment of the indicators must take into account 
that they are based on changes in financial 
market prices, which not only reflect monetary 
policy, but are also influenced by other factors.
However, the indicator dynamics provide a 
good description of the changes in the monet -
ary policy stance in terms of its direction of im -
pact. The estimations of such indicators pre -
sented in this article consistently suggest that 
the Eurosystem’s non- standard measures have, 
in fact, increased the expansiveness of the 
monetary policy stance overall.
Even in a normalising interest rate environment 
where the short- term interest rates are becom -
ing uncoupled from the negative lower bound, 
an analysis of the yield curve and its informa -
tion content, bundled into the indicators pre -
sented here, provide important additional in -
formation for monetary policy analysis. For in -
stance, the impact of policy rate changes and EMS is a consist -
ent indicator in 
phases of  standard and non- standard monetary policy
Not even EMS 
can provide information on adequacy of monetary policy stance

structure  valuable for monetary policy analysis …… even in an environment of normalising interest rates
38 As 30-year OIS rates are not available for the period 
prior to 2006, the EMS is calculated using government 
bond yields.
39 While the EMS is similar to the common monetary 
models for analysing monetary policy in that it is based on 
an interest rate spread concept, the underlying neutral 
interest rate concept does not take into account the typic -
ally modelled shocks affecting the course of the natural 
rate, which a central bank in an environment of nominal 
rigidities responds to via its interest policy. In this model 
class, the output gap, which monetary policy makers use to 
influence inflation developments through interest policy, is 
determined by the difference between the expected path 
of short- term (forward) interest rates and the time- varying 
path of the natural (forward) interest rate. See Barsky et al

the associated monetary policy communication 
on the expected path of short- term interest 
rates and on term premiums can be shown.
Finally, it should be borne in mind that, al -
though monetary policy indicators are used to 
measure the monetary policy stance, they do 
not per se  provide information as to whether 
this monetary policy stance is adequate. In 
view of this, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
strategy takes into account a number of eco -
nomic, price, credit and financial indicators that 
can be interpreted in terms of their implications for the medium- term inflation outlook and that 
ultimately make it possible to reliably gauge the 
adequacy of the monetary policy stance, which 
is something indicators derived from the term 
structure are not capable of. However, meth -
odological developments in the area of term 
structure modelling are advancing rapidly at 
present. It would, therefore, appear to make 
sense for central banks to follow these devel -
opments and to critically examine the ensuing 
monetary policy indicators in terms of their 
suitability for monetary policy analysis.Continuous

Distributed ledger technologies  
in payments and securities settlement: 
potential and risks
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has made huge strides in recent years, and it has now become 
a major testing ground for financial service providers, financial market infrastructure operators, 
central banks and the like. The Bundesbank’s interest in this topic centres around how DLT could 
be incorporated into the world of payments and settlement systems. The term “distributed ledger” 
(DL) is generally used to describe a database shared across a network which gives participants 
(“nodes”) joint rights to write, read and store entries to the ledger. Potentially, DLT offers a num -
ber of benefits due to the distributed storage of data, which can simplify reconciliation processes 
associated with complex labour- sharing value added chains. DLT is seen as having disruptive 
potential since it generally allows transactions to be carried out directly – that is, without inter -
mediaries. Developed originally for the virtual currency Bitcoin, DLT will nonetheless require exten -
sive modification if it is to be adapted to the needs of the financial sector. For one thing, the legal 
framework as it stands requires participants to be identifiable, transactions to be kept secret from 
third parties, and transactions to be settled with absolute finality. For another, transaction 
throughput needs to be high. Given the current state of the art, it is rather unlikely that DLT will 
be put to use in large- value or retail payments. In the field of securities settlement, though, the 
shrinking processing times and reconciliation costs might prove to be a more important factor 
and suggest that DLT may have its uses in this area. The Deutsche Bundesbank is analysing the 
pros and cons of DLT in a project it is running with Deutsche Börse. While this project indicates 
that DLT does indeed have its functional merits, it is still unclear whether DLT also has the edge 
over today’s technology in terms of security, efficiency, costs and speed. This article then goes on 
to discuss the possibility of providing central bank- issued digital currency. Probably the most 
pressing design question here is whether central bank- issued digital currency should be issued to 
non- banks as well. However, the implications of central bank- issued digital currency for monetary 
policy and financial stability and for the structure and business models of banks are hard to 
fathom, which is why there appears to be no realistic prospect of central bank- issued digital cur -
rency being rolled out for non- banks in the foreseeable future. In its capacity as an operator, 
supervisor and catalyst, the Bundesbank is continuing to analyse this technology so that it can 
actively shape the ongoing conversation about DLT by contributing insights of its own.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has made 
huge strides in recent years, and it has now be -
come a major testing ground for financial ser -
vice providers, financial market infrastructure 
operators, central banks and the like. Many re -
gard DLT as a disruptive technology – one that 
could trigger fundamental change, or even 
structural breaks, in the industries in which it is 
applied. In the financial sector, for instance, it 
could make intermediaries obsolete or pave the 
way for new, more efficient processes in areas 
such as payments and securities settlement. 
This development was originally set in motion 
by mounting interest in “virtual currencies” – 
first and foremost in Bitcoin, which still ranks as 
the best- known field in which DLT has been put 
to use. But attention is now increasingly turn -
ing to the underlying technology itself.
This article focuses on the role of DLT in pay -
ments and securities settlement – two areas 
which are highly important for the Bundes -
bank, given that section 3 of the Bundesbank 
Act (Gesetz über die Deutsche Bundesbank)  re-
quires the Bank to “arrange for the execution 
of domestic and cross- border payments and 
[…] contribute to the stability of payment and 
clearing systems.”
The Bundesbank fulfils this statutory mandate 
by performing three different roles. First, it de -
velops and operates major payment and settle -
ment systems, often in conjunction with other 
central banks, and in this context explores in -
novative technical capabilities which can con -
tribute to their stability and efficiency. Second, 
the Bundesbank acts as a catalyst to forge im -
provements in payment operations and settle -
ment structures. The better the Bundesbank 
grasps the practical implications of technolo -
gies or processes, the more forcefully it will be 
able to present its arguments, which always 
aim to preserve the stability and enhance the 
efficiency of payment and settlement systems. 
Third, in addition to its role as a banking super -
visor, in which it oversees individual institutions (market players), the Bundesbank also monitors 
the stability of systems and tools used in the 
field of payments and settlement. Being able to 
gauge the relative merits of state-  of- the- art 
technology is a key skill in this regard. That is 
why the Bundesbank – much like other central 
banks worldwide – has been putting a great 
deal of thought into DLT, even though this 
technology is still very much in its infancy.
This article introduces readers to the topic of 
DLT, illuminates the opportunities and chal -
lenges it presents, shows its potential for driv -
ing market change and explores the possible 
repercussions for the Bundesbank’s role in pay -
ments and securities settlement.
Functional analysis of DLT
Understanding how DLT works from a technical 
perspective and what sets it apart from the 
traditional payment and settlement system 
architecture is the first step in gauging the op -
portunities and risks it presents.
How DLT works
DLT is a special type of electronic data process -
ing and storage system. The term “distributed 
ledger” (DL) is generally used to describe a 
database shared across a network which gives 
participants (“nodes”) joint rights to write, read 
and store entries to the ledger. While trad -
itional distributed databases likewise distribute 
and store data across the entire network, en -
tries there can only be created or updated by a 
central administrator.1 DL networks differ from 
traditional databases in that no such central 
administrator is needed to manage the data -
base or ledger. New information can be pro -
vided by nodes at any time and added to the 
database by means of a validation process. 
These new data entries are added to each DLT: a prominent 
testing ground in the financial sector

node’s copy of the DL so that each node will 
always have the latest version of the entire 
database.2 The above chart shows different 
types of network model. The ability to write to 
the DL –  that is, the power of control over 
ledger updates – dictates which of these three 
models a network is assigned to according to 
this definition: in a centralised set- up, control 
lies with a single administrator; in a decentral -
ised model, with multiple nodes; and in a dis -
tributed model in the narrower sense, with 
every single node.
The most common DLT applications are based 
on blockchain technology, which has proven to 
be particularly useful for recording transaction 
histories and will be used for illustrative pur -
poses in the remainder of this article.3 In the 
case of the blockchain, the distributed ledger is 
made up of a chain of chronologically se -
quenced blocks containing one or more trans -
actions.4 The ledger is updated by generating a 
new transaction block and adding it to the 
existing chain of transaction blocks.
To synchronise additions to every node’s copy 
of the distributed ledger, the nodes need to 
have a reconciliation and validation process in 
place.5 This is normally done using what are 
known as consensus mechanisms such as proof 
of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS) or practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT). The consensus 
mechanism defines the condition which has to 
be met for new valid transactions to be added 
to the ledger. Conditions might include the de -
monstrative use of a node’s computing power 
(proof of work), evidence of the node’s share 
of units of value transferred within the network 
(proof of stake), or a minimum number of 
nodes agreeing on the validity of a given trans -
action (PBFT). These protocols serve two pur -
poses. First, they help forge agreement on

3 As a rule, DLT applications can also be run without block -
chain. In this case, the database can contain either the en -
tire history (not in block format), the net state of assets or 
information distributed across the network, or a node’s in -
dividual ledger updates applied to the preceding version of 
the ledger (see, for example, Deloitte (2016), Bitcoin, 
blockchain & distributed ledgers: caught between promise 
and reality).
4 Information contained in a transaction block are not 
stored directly in a blockchain but reduced to what are 
known as cryptographic hashes. Each new data block con -
tains the preceding data block’s hash, thus creating the 
chain structure by which the history of any transaction can 
be traced back immutably.

transactions to be added to the chain (consen -
sus); second, they help validate transactions so 
as to prevent misuse or counterfeiting, eg due 
to the renewed use of previously used assets 
by the same payer (the double- spending prob -
lem).
Cryptographic tools are used to authenticate 
nodes and verify their rights. Nodes wishing to 
add new transactions to the DL, for instance, 
have to authenticate themselves by providing 
their digital signature. Cryptographic mechan -
isms can also be used to preserve the integrity 
of the DL.
Since DLT generally allows any kind of digital 
information to be stored and distributed, it can 
also be used to record more complex contin -
gent transactions. The nodes can choose to 
make a particular transfer of assets contingent 
on certain predefined criteria being met. The 
automated process by which an algorithm re -
views those conditions and subsequently exe -cutes the transfers is often referred to as a 
smart contract. It is not, then, a special type of 
contractual agreement but a piece of program -
ming code that is automatically executed 
whenever certain conditions are met and can 
play a role in contractual performance.
Generally speaking, the network of nodes in 
which the distributed ledger is used can be 
configured as a public (“permissionless”) or pri -
vate (“permissioned”) network. A public net -
work would be open to anyone satisfying the 
basic technical requirements, while a private 
configuration would restrict data access to cer -
tain individuals or institutions. Confining net -
work access to a selected group of users can 
make sense on a number of counts, for in -
stance if there is a restricted group of counter -
parties, or participants are expected to meet 
certain minimum standards. It also hides the 
ledger from unauthorised third parties. Where, 
for instance, DLT is used to settle trade finance 
transactions, a permissioned system could re -Cryptography

Functional comparison with 
existing systems
DLT mainly differs from traditional financial 
market infrastructures in that it is designed to 
facilitate a direct electronic transfer of assets 
between nodes without the need for any 
account- holding agent to be involved. Financial 
market infrastructures, on the other hand, act 
as intermediaries in the sense of a hub and 
spoke system – that is, users route transfers of 
assets via a central institution (the hub) to other 
users. That central institution operates ac -
counts for each user and runs the system. Fi -
nancial market infrastructures, ie payment sys -
tems, securities settlement systems, central se -
curities depositories (CSDs) and central coun -
terparties (CCPs), are core components of 
today’s financial system and serve as conduits 
between different markets and participants.
Payments
In today’s financial system, there are a multi -
tude of intermediaries in the field of payments. 
Their number and variety depends on factors 
including the “institutional distance” between 
the parties sending and receiving payment.6 If 
both parties are customers with the same bank, 
that bank will be the sole intermediary. But if 
they bank with different credit institutions, 
there will be at least two intermediaries, plus a 
clearing house if the two banks do not have 
accounts with each other. Larger amounts are 
normally routed via a large- value payment sys -
tem like TARGET2. Payments across currency 
areas will involve foreign payment systems or 
correspondent banks, and perhaps also the 
central infrastructure known as continuous 
linked settlement (CLS).When DLT is used, payment is first initiated by 
the sender, followed by a consensus mechan -
ism; when that is concluded, the payment is 
added to the DL. Adding the payment to the 
DL replaces, as it were, clearing (= the process 
of determining mutual claims or liabilities and 
netting), settlement (= the settlement of exist -
ing claims or liabilities), and potentially also in -
ternal accounting, provided the parties involved 
agree that the entry they have initiated in the 
distributed ledger entails a transfer of title.
Securities settlement
Compared to payments, today’s securities trad -
ing and post- trade operations involve a far 
greater number and variety of intermediaries. 
Securities traders, exchanges, clearing houses 
or CCPs, CSDs, registrars, custodians and po -
tentially also sub- custodians all have a role to 
play in a security’s life cycle. There will be cases 
where some of these functions have been 
pooled to a degree within a single institution. 
Complexity levels are high and processes are 
error- prone, making reconciliation a very la -
borious task. DLT has the technical capability to 
reduce securities settlement to just a few pro -
cess steps. Thus, if two nodes make a matching 
declaration in the distributed ledger, the entry 
in the distributed ledger could be simultan -
eously interpreted as the trade, clearing, settle -
ment and accounting.7 All the nodes can ac -
cess the same data pool.
Prospective benefits
Due to its network structure and synchronised 
access to a common database, DLT promises to 
take transparency, operational efficiency, secur -
ity and resilience, independence from inter -
mediaries and automated contract perform -
ance to the next level.DLT enables

Transparency and immutability
A DL enables the nodes of a DLT network (un -
less defined otherwise) to view the entire data 
history.8 Transfers of assets and exchanges of 
information are thus visible to the entire net -
work. Information can be stored in a way that 
prevents it from being manipulated. That allows 
a tamper- proof record of transactions to be 
stored without any need for the nodes to trust 
each other.
Operational efficiency
Another way in which DLT might have an edge 
over traditional financial market infrastructures 
is that it could reduce complexity in the settle -
ment of financial market transactions requiring 
a great deal of reconciliation. Direct reconcili -
ation between nodes and the accompanying 
documentation could automate multiple 
process-  heavy intermediate steps and shorten 
transfer times, particularly for labour- sharing processes such as trade finance. The use of DLT 
might also drive down settlement costs, not so 
much for transaction settlement itself but po -
tentially for all the downstream post- trade pro -
cesses. While nodes will all need to have 
greater storage capabilities to maintain the 
data, it will probably be far easier to view the 
data.
Security and resilience
A decentralised system could boost the security 
of assets or information transferred across the 
network. Unlike a centralised settlement plat -
form, DLT has no single point of failure – that 
is, a point in a system that, if it failed to work 
correctly, would lead to a failure of the entire 
system. DLT’s ability to compensate for an in -
operable or compromised node is often seen as DLT generally 
offers a high level of transparency

providing enhanced protection against failure. 
If one copy of the DL is subverted by a mali -
cious actor, other copies of the DL containing 
the original data can be used to correct those 
changes. However, having multiple nodes with 
identical rights exposes a DLT to multiple pos -
sible points of attack, potentially driving up the 
cost of shielding the system from cyber risks.
Independence from intermediaries
DLT generally enables transactions or informa -
tion to be exchanged between peers (P2P) 
without the need for any intermediaries, some -
thing which is otherwise only possible with 
cash payments. In theory, DLT could do away 
with the need for dedicated systems run by 
intermediaries. That would render the inter -
mediate agents which traditionally validate 
financial   transactions obsolete from a purely 
technical perspective.
Automated contract performance
DLT promises huge potential for optimising 
processes through the automated execution of 
contractual rights using what are known as 
smart contracts. Particularly transactions which 
require counterparties to reconfirm or issue a 
guarantee stand to become more efficient as a 
result of being automated with smart con -
tracts. DLT could, for example, be used to auto -
mate interest or dividend payouts in securities 
business. These benefits do, however, depend 
on the specific design of the DLT application in 
question.
Challenges
The original blockchain for Bitcoin was created 
for a virtual currency. Its key characteristics are 
the intermediary- free, direct (P2P) transfer of 
Bitcoins, its accessibility for any participant who 
is not required to operate under their real name 
(and may operate under multiple pseudonyms), 
the complete transparency it provides across all 
transactions for all nodes, the use of the proof of work protocol as a consensus mechanism, 
the designation of the longest blockchain as 
authoritative, regardless of when the blocks 
were created, and the fact that transfers are 
confined to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain 
would need a variety of adjustments in order to 
be migrated to the real financial system. Some 
advances in DLT have already resolved the real- 
world challenges to a degree,9 but this might 
also lessen the potential benefits. If DLT is to be 
a viable proposition in the financial sector, 
however, certain rules must be complied with.
Identifiability
Anonymous transfers of assets of the kind seen 
on public DLT platforms (public ledgers) do not 
allow participants to be identified. Anti- money 
laundering legislation, however, states that it 
must be possible to unambiguously identify 
natural and legal persons. This requirement to 
“know your customer” means ascertaining the 
identity of network participants, which is why 
an application like Bitcoin – where transactions 
take place anonymously – is ineligible. A trans -
fer as a P2P transaction would then only be 
possible subject to rules which no longer guar -
antee anonymity. Thus, any application of DLT 
in the financial sector would only be possible 
with a private ledger, rather than a public one.
Confidentiality
DLT generally enables any participant to view 
the transaction history, which means that the 
confidentiality of financial transactions cannot Direct P2P 
 transactions

be assured without encryption. Even encrypted 
storage of data at every node would still not 
offer sufficient safety. If future improvements in 
hardware or software components enabled 
data to be decrypted, that would expose the 
transaction history again to all the nodes at 
which the data had been stored. This com -
promise of future confidentiality (“forward se -
crecy”) could be resolved by not having all the 
data stored at every node but exchanging them 
in sub- networks of a kind. This safeguard 
would, however, mark a significant departure 
from the fundamental principles of full trans -
parency and comprehensibility of a distributed 
database, and make DLT less tamper- proof.
Scalability and performance
Scalability and performance – as measured, for 
instance, in terms of system latency periods – 
are crucially important criteria when applying 
DLT to infrastructures with high throughput 
rates and/ or high transaction volumes during 
peak times. The scalability of DLT solutions de -
pends on the choice of technical configuration 
and especially on the consensus mechanism. 
Depending on which consensus mechanism is 
used, DLT solutions require far more data stor -
age capacity, data instructions and time to set -
tle a single transaction than a centralised finan -
cial market infrastructure. If DLT systems fail to 
reach the transaction throughput rates achieved 
by today’s financial market infrastructures, it 
would only make sense to apply them to sys -
tems which are highly complex but run at rela -
tively low transaction volumes. By way of com -
parison, the Bitcoin network settles a peak of 
roughly 350,000 transactions worldwide every 
day, and given its current configuration, it is 
thought to be running at almost full capacity. 
The German payment system alone, by con -
trast, processes more than 75 million transac -
tions on average every business day.10
Resilience compromised
Some DLT developers keen to boost perform -
ance have introduced hierarchical role concepts which assign different rights to different nodes. 
Some are given more extensive read, write and 
validation rights; others are only authorised to 
propose transactions, say. This could ultimately 
compromise the very operational resilience 
which the elimination of a single point of fail -
ure set out to achieve. If a node with extended 
rights came under attack, a malicious actor 
could potentially inflict greater damage and 
could furthermore focus its efforts on the least 
protected node (the weakest link). Under cer -
tain circumstances, then, it is far more difficult 
to guarantee data security than in the case of a 
centralised system. However, this weakest link 
dilemma would not be confined to read access 
rights. Depending on the consensus mechan -
ism used, a malicious actor could feed faulty 
data into the network. Where the PBFT proto -
col, which is currently a popular consensus 
mechanism in hierarchical DLT networks, is 
used, that form of unauthorised write access 
would, however, require a successful attack on 
the majority of validating nodes.
Finality
Financial transactions require both clearly de -
fined de jure  and de facto  finality, ie a specific 
point in time as from which a transaction may 
be considered valid. State- of- the- art RTGS sys -
tems immediately reuse incoming funds, while 
in the field of securities, financial institutions 
sometimes sell or lend securities or use them as 
collateral immediately after settlement finality. 
Some DLT consensus mechanisms, however, 
such as the proof of work protocol, only offer 
probabilistic finality. In this particular consensus 
mechanism, the longest chain of blocks is the 
valid one. There is a certain degree of probabil -
ity, however, that various nodes will have 
added different blocks to the valid chain, creat -
ing bifurcations (forks) in the chain which make 
it difficult at first to be sure which chain is the 
valid one. Only when one chain of blocks 
grows more quickly will it prevail as the au -Current DLT

thoritative chain. Transactions in the shorter 
part of the chain from the bifurcation are can -
celled retroactively. That is why these consen -
sus mechanisms are said to offer only probabil -
istic finality.
How virtual assets relate to real assets
Bitcoins, which circulate in the currently best-  
known DL network, are only ever a virtual cur -
rency; that is, they do not exist outside the 
blockchain. Bitcoins can only be transferred 
across the blockchain and cannot leave the 
blockchain. A security, by contrast, embodies a 
claim in the real world. While that security can 
be transferred via DLT, its migration onto the 
blockchain depends on the existence of a body, 
such as a central securities depository, to link 
real, off- ledger assets with the digital world. In 
other words, there needs to be a trusted body 
at least at the interface between the real world 
and DLT.11 That is not the case in the Bitcoin 
blockchain. To put it more broadly, while the 
sale of a good can be documented in a distrib -
uted ledger, that is not enough to validate the 
very existence of that good, its specifications 
and possibly also its previous ownership status. 
DLT’s assertion that it can make trustless trans -
fers a reality, then, would be confined to the 
purely virtual realm and have no points of ref -
erence in the real world.
Possible changes in the 
 market
DLT is a technical concept which is being tested 
simultaneously in a number of sectors and 
fields of application. The following section of 
this article will discuss how DLT might trans -
form the markets for payments and securities 
settlement. Judging by the above description 
of DLT’s functionalities, its actual use in the fi -
nancial sector would generally appear to be 
beneficial whenever extensive reconciliation is 
required between multiple independent partici -
pants and/ or repeated recourse to the data -
base is necessary, and whenever a complex value chain is involved. It goes without saying 
that it must be possible to digitalise assets for 
use in DLT.
Payments
Some believe that DLT has a high degree of dis -
ruptive potential in the field of payments. The 
P2P network architecture in particular is re -
garded by some market participants as being 
instrumental to an efficient, globally accessible 
asset transfer capability. Yet a nuanced analysis 
reveals that the special structural features of 
DLT will not per se  revolutionise the world of 
payments.
Payments in the euro area
The trend in the European payments space is 
towards ever- faster systems which settle pay -
ments as close to real time as possible. In large- 
value payments business, it is customary for 
payments to be settled with finality in central 
bank money directly between two banks via 
RTGS systems. In future, the TARGET  Instant 
Payment Settlement Service (TIPS) is expected 
to make the direct transfer of funds in real time 
a reality for retail payments as well. RTGS sys -
tems such as TARGET2 process payments effi -
ciently, and are optimised for fast transfers, be -
sides requiring a minimum of reconciliation. So 
far, there is nothing to suggest that the use of 
DLT for payments in a single currency area can 
achieve any efficiency gains over the estab -
lished settlement systems. As it happens, pay -
ment settlement using DLT will probably even 
become slower and more costly, depending on 
how the consensus mechanism is designed and 
which database structure is selected. From the 
perspective of today’s technical capabilities, 
there is little prospect of DLT being put to wide -
spread use in large- value and retail payments in 
Europe.Trustless trans-
fers by third  parties only  possible in cyberspace

Payments across currency areas/ trade 
 finance
The situation is different with regard to pay -
ments across currency areas. In order to be -
come a participant in RTGS systems, a bank 
must generally have a registered office, a sub -
sidiary or a branch office in the relevant cur -
rency area. If this is not the case, it has the 
possibility of maintaining what are known as 
correspondent banking relationships with a 
credit institution that belongs to the currency 
area in question. Correspondent banking is less 
standardised than centralised payment systems 
and often calls for extensive reconciliation pro -
cesses between those involved. Settlement 
takes a long time (as a rule, more than one day) 
and causes relatively high transaction costs. 
DLT and the use of smart contracts could sim -
plify some of the process stages in correspond -
ent banking or even make them superfluous 
and allow quicker and cheaper settlement for 
end users. The development of a number of 
DLT- based pilot projects for correspondent 
banking relationships has led financial service 
providers currently operating in that field to re -
view their own procedures in terms of boosting 
efficiency.
It is furthermore conceivable that DLT solutions 
could help to improve financial inclusion in 
some countries which have a poorly developed 
financial infrastructure.
In addition to this, the use of DLT in trade fi -
nance seems to offer advantages where several 
process stages have to be executed and con -
firmed step by step. DLT could, above all, make 
reconciliation between those involved easier 
and faster by automating processes that are 
settled manually at present.
Securities settlement
Many observers ascribe major potential to DLT 
in securities settlement and other post- trade 
areas. There, too, possibilities of deployment are seen in those areas where there are com -
plex transaction chains and there is a relatively 
large need for manual reconciliation between 
the parties involved in the transaction.
Reduced reconciliation workload
In the life cycle of a security, actual settlement 
of the trade is followed in many instances by a 
need to balance the amounts, say, in the case 
of capital measures such as interest payments. 
This matching process is known as reconcili -
ation. DLT could offer advantages at this point. 
Owing to the distributed, but uniform data -
base, no differences should occur at least 
within a DL. All those involved are using the 
same pool of data. Reconciliation between the 
CSDs and custodians as well as between custo -
dians and account- keeping banks could be sim -
plified by the use of DLT.12
Shortening process chains
The biggest potential advantage of DLT in se -
curities settlement lies in the possibility of com -
bining or greatly simplifying process stages.13 
Smart contracts, which allow complex se -
quences of transactions to be conducted as a 
single transaction, are one major instrument 
for this purpose. In fact, more than two parties 
can be involved as well as more than one cur -
rency and several securities. This could save 
time and would be of particular benefit if risks 
are reduced by conducting different parts of a 
transaction simultaneously.
Corporate actions and custody
The distributed storage of data when using DLT 
promises to make it easier to determine the 
current and historic securities holders, since the 
relevant information is distributed automatic -
ally in the system and is directly available. This Correspondent 
banking and trade finance seem more suited to DLT

would simplify the processing of corporate ac -
tions (eg interest payments, redemption upon 
maturity, stock splits). Above and beyond that, 
various corporate actions could be (partly) 
automated by using smart contracts by, for ex -
ample, automatically generating and conduct -
ing the transactions for the coupon payment.14 
In an extreme case, the complete life cycle of a 
security would be represented in a smart con -
tract. After issuance, such a security would not 
need any kind of additional action in order to 
be settled.
Reference data and 
 identification solutions
Many DL applications use the immutability of 
the data once they have been written and the 
distributed structure in order to store and ad -
minister unambiguous reference data and clas -
sifications on it using smart contracts. Even 
though such solutions are not designed for the 
transfer of money or securities, they do offer a 
number of applications which are indispens -
able for the settlement of financial transac -
tions, such as identity management.15 This 
might relate to updating the master data of 
participants in a financial market infrastructure, 
for example. In such kinds of tasks, DLT is char -
acterised by a large degree of automation in 
the processing of information. This is the case 
because the authorised participants in a net -
work are able to enter changes to their data 
directly into the network for validation. Once 
they have been validated, the data are updated 
immediately at all nodes. Solutions of this kind 
could be an advantage precisely in correspond -
ent banking, where it is vital to identify the par -
ticipants in a transaction unambiguously in 
order to allow the implementation of the 
“know your customer” principle on a trans -
national and secure basis.16 For the majority of 
applications in the field of finance, making 
changes to reference data without externally 
authorised verification is unlikely to be accept -
able, however.Central bank- issued digital 
 currency
In current payment systems, market partici -
pants insist on settlement in central bank 
money where large amounts are involved. 
When using DLT, the question might arise in fu -
ture as to whether central bank- issued digital 
currency could be provided for the safe settle -
ment of such larger transactions. Central bank- 
issued digital currency would rank alongside 
cash and credit balances with the central bank 
–  the latter essentially being the preserve of 
commercial banks and general government – 
as another form of central bank money, and it 
would have to be posted in the same way as 
a central bank liability on the balance sheet. 
There are several technical options in terms of 
the form this could take. Transfers could be 
value- based (like cash) or account- based (like 
deposits), anonymous or registered, its use 
could be restricted –  in terms of amount or 
payment purpose, say – and it could be remu -
nerated or, like cash, earn no interest.
The actual way this is implemented would ul -
timately determine its macroeconomic impact, 
and it is precisely this which has to be taken 
into account when making any comprehensive 
assessment.
Arguably, the most important question here 
concerns who should be authorised to use cen -
tral bank- issued digital currency, or, to be more 
precise, whether central bank- issued digital 
currency should be issued to non- banks as 
well. This is because, if that were the case, sub -
stitution effects between the different forms of 
money would have to be expected. In particu -
lar, non- banks could convert their sight de -
posits at banks into central bank- issued digital 
currency if storage as an entry on the distrib -
uted ledger appears more secure and more Decentralised 
maintenance of reference data using DLTCentral bank- issued digital currency under discussion
Should non- 
banks also have central bank- issued digital currency at their disposal?

convenient than hoarding it as cash. Significant 
parts of non- banks’ sight deposits being shifted 
onto a blockchain, however, and no longer 
being available to the credit institutions as vir -
tually unremunerated funding might have con -
siderable repercussions for the interest margin, 
the scale of lending as well as the business 
models in the banking system, and the banking 
system’s structure. Furthermore, a simple ex -
pansion of the monetary base, accompanied 
by a shift from sight deposits into central bank- 
issued digital currency and thus an increase in 
central bank liabilities, would require a corres -
ponding increase in balance sheet assets, say, 
in the form of additional refinancing operations 
that would have to be appropriately collateral -
ised. The effects on the structure and the risk 
profile of central bank balance sheets would be 
considerable.
Seen in that light, the potential monetary pol -
icy and stability policy implications of introdu -
cing central bank- issued digital currency, say on 
the basis of DLT, are manifold and –  even 
though they are currently being studied by 
some central banks – all but impossible to pre -
dict.17 Even leaving aside current uncertainty 
about the technological potential of DLT, which 
is a factor here, too, this makes its application 
to central bank-  issued digital currency seem 
unrealistic at present.
Implications and outlook
Possible implications for the 
roles of the Bundesbank
Role as an operator
By operating payment and settlement systems, 
above all for settlement between banks, the 
Bundesbank supports – along with other cen -
tral banks – the stable settlement of payments 
in the Eurosystem. In the case of DLT, the Bun -
desbank sees the use of permissioned systems 
as the sole option – in other words, private 
ledgers which allow the identification of par -ticipants. The Bundesbank is currently conduct -
ing a conceptual study together with Deutsche 
Börse in order to make a more exact assess -
ment of DLT’s potential. This study explores 
whether DLT is suitable for use in the field of 
digitally transferable currency units and secur -
ities and how efficient and stable it is. Initial 
results confirm the general functional suitability 
of DLT. The technical performance and the scal -
ability of such a system will have to be exam -
ined in further stages, however, in order to be 
able to tell whether DLT is fit for practical use.
Role as a catalyst
In its role as a catalyst, the Bundesbank sup -
ports ongoing development in payments and 
securities settlement with the aim of fostering 
stability and efficiency. New procedures and 
techniques have to hold out the promise of 
added value and fit into the existing regulatory 
system. In order to assess this, it is necessary to 
understand the procedures. One way to do this 
is to apply and analyse them oneself.
There is a need to bring together the various 
participants with diverging interests, as the in -
dustry has pronounced network features. At 
the same time, it is important not to distort 
market developments or competition between 
rival systems. Changes in the procedures and 
processes require acceptance by a majority of 
participants so that potential benefits are real -
ised. Partial changes may even be economically 
harmful, especially without complete interoper -
ability with existing systems. The generally high 
investment costs involved in system change 
coupled with low variable costs in production 
also promote technological path dependen -
cies. Without the convincing prospect of sig -
nificant efficiency gains, it is difficult to per -Implications

Blockchain research project
The Deutsche Bundesbank and Deutsche 
Börse are cooperating on a research project 
on the use of blockchain technology in pay-
ment and securities settlement between 
banks. The jointly developed prototype en-
ables the settlement of security purchases on a delivery- versus- payment basis in ex-
change for centrally issued digital coins, as 
well as the pure transfer of digital securities. In addition, it is capable of executing basic corporate actions such as interest payments 
and the redemption of securities at matur-ity. In technical terms, it uses a permissioned blockchain based on Hyperledger Fabric.
1 In 
principle, the prototype could also be based on other DLT versions.

suade market participants of the merits of new 
procedures.
In order to contribute to the cross- application 
harmonisation of DLT, the Bundesbank is also 
taking part in an initiative for the standardisa -
tion of “Blockchain and Distributed Ledger 
Technologies” organised by the International 
Organization for Standardisation. The aim of 
the initiative is to apply a uniform framework of 
reference in order to promote interoperability 
and the exchange of data between users, ap -
plications and systems which use this technol -
ogy.
Role as an overseer
In its role as overseer of payments and settle -
ment systems, the Bundesbank analyses all 
relevant developments in terms of their impact 
on the security and efficiency of the financial 
sector. At the present time, oversight in the 
case of DLT is confined to monitoring the mar -ket. If large DLT- based systems wished to start 
up operations in Germany, they would be as -
sessed on the basis of the same criteria as 
those for the current systems.
Outlook
DLT continues to be the subject of in- depth re -
search and development in the expectation 
that its use will be able to lower transaction 
costs. Transferring its original role as the tech -
nology behind the virtual currency Bitcoin to 
applications in payments and securities settle -
ment is proving to be a veritable challenge. It is 
becoming apparent that a large number of ad -
justments to the original Bitcoin procedure will 
be necessary. A purely P2P implementation 
without intermediaries is unlikely to be practic -
able in the financial sector. Added to this are 
non- functional criteria: the scalability and per -
formance of DLT are still too limited to be con -
sidered for use in high- volume applications.Operation on 
DLT basis exam-ined applying the same criteria as for existing systemsPrototype is neutral in terms of 
 monetary policy
For the blockchain- based settlement pro-cesses, the coin providing authority trans-
fers digital coins from an external cash cycle 
onto the blockchain at the start of each 
business day. They are available for network 
participants during the trading day. The 
coins are returned to the external cash cycle 
at the end of the day. Securities are made 
available for trading within the blockchain 
network by a bond providing authority. The 
securities remain on the blockchain throughout and do not leave the network 
until instruction has been received from the participant or upon maturity.Prototype meets regulatory  requirements in principle
The prototype ensures the confi  dentiality of 
transaction content using an adaptable 
rights framework. It takes into consider-ation the existing regulatory requirements and covers all business- related procedures 
for internal and external accounting and for 
regulatory reporting. This means that the 
prototype generally provides the basis for a 
practical application. However, it is a con-
ceptual study and thus far from being 
market- ready. In a further stage of the pro-
ject, the prototype will be further developed 
to allow technical performance and scal-
ability to be analysed in more detail.Deutsche Bundesbank

At present, research is being undertaken both 
into the underlying principles – the technical 
design of DLT per se  – as well as the application- 
related interfaces and the legal forms it could 
take. The fact that these developments are tak -
ing place simultaneously makes predictions es -
pecially difficult. The actual benefits of DLT are 
likely to be apparent not so much in its use in 
traditional structures and processes, but rather 
come to bear more strongly in modified struc -
tures and processes. This is countered, how -
ever, not only by the potential for persistence 
of the existing service providers but also by the 
technology- related inertia of developments in 
payments and securities settlement (path de -
pendency/ network effects). Certainly, there 
may be some isolated rapid applications of DLT 
that do not result immediately in system 
change. Nevertheless, introducing it on a broad 
front would call for a simultaneous cooperative effort on the part of virtually all those involved. 
At all events, DLT has already led to further 
work being performed on some traditional pro -
cedures in order to improve their efficiency.
Depending on one’s point of view, DLT is cur -
rently encountering a period of disillusionment 
in the face of its by no means trivial application 
in the financial system or receiving increasingly 
wide attention as a result of a growing number 
of feasibility studies, not least by central banks. 
The outcome of such experiments is uncertain. 
On the one hand, major challenges have not 
yet been mastered. On the other hand, it has 
often been the case that the real advantage of 
an innovation was not yet apparent at the early 
stages of its development. As the Bundesbank 
sees it, there are, for now, good grounds to go 
on exploring the practical applicability of DLT in 
payments and in securities settlement.Deutsche Bundesbank

The performance of German credit 
institutions  in 2016
In a challenging financial market setting of persistently low interest rates on the one hand and 
solid economic growth on the other, the profitability of German banks, as reported in the pub -
lished annual reports prepared according to the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch), 
has declined in their core business areas. With total assets also down, net interest income and net 
commission income were significantly reduced from the previous year by a total of €5.4 billion, 
dropping to €120.9 billion. By contrast, the significantly improved other operating result of €4.1 
billion had a stabilising effect, which meant that operating income just exceeded the previous 
year’s level, at €128.1 billion. On the back of somewhat lower administrative spending, the cost/ 
income ratio of German banks improved slightly to 69.2%. Overall, the heterogeneity between 
and also within the various categories of banks was particularly pronounced in 2016 on account 
of one- off factors, some of which affected specific larger banks only.
The result from the valuation of assets fell from its historically favourable level, deteriorating by 
€5.3 billion to -€8.8 billion. This was mainly due to very high value adjustments, primarily in the 
credit portfolios of shipping loans at specific big banks and Landesbanken. The savings banks and 
credit cooperatives (primary institutions), on the other hand, benefited from the healthy economic 
climate and the concomitant low need for risk provisioning in households’ credit portfolios. On 
balance, they released risk provisions built up in previous years, leading to positive results from 
the valuation of assets. The resultant higher annual results were mostly used to further bolster 
their balance sheet capital base.
The profit for the financial year before tax rose by 4.6% to €27.8 billion. Of this amount, €4.2 
billion was used to offset net losses brought forward from previous years and €7.8 billion went 
towards taxes on earnings. The revenue reserves were stocked up by €0.6 billion net and the fund 
for general banking risks by €10.8 billion on balance. The primary institutions accounted for more 
than 80% of the net transfers to this fund. Altogether, the aggregate balance sheet capital (total 
equity) for all banks arising from the profit for the financial year thus increased by €11.4 billion, 
with gross capital injections of €16.7 billion standing against high withdrawals of €5.3 billion. The 
latter were mainly used for a distribution to the parent institution in the case of one big bank and 
to offset losses in the case of two Landesbanken hit especially hard by the shipping crisis. The 
aggregate balance sheet profit rose by almost two- thirds to €4.4 billion.Deutsche Bundesbank

Banks’ business environment
The German economy’s solid growth continued 
in the 2016 reporting year. Once again, this 
was mainly driven by steeply rising private and 
government consumption. Households bene -
fited from the increase in real disposable in -
come brought about by the low inflation rate 
and favourable labour market situation. Gov -
ernment spending was stepped up largely be -
cause of expenditure on the provision of sup -
port for refugees, but also on pensions and 
healthcare. In addition, the upturn in the resi -
dential real estate market, which has persisted 
for some years now, continued. Building per -
mits for housing construction, for instance, 
stood at a total of 375,388, which was 19.8% 
higher than their prior- year level.1 The increase 
in exports was dampened by weak world trade, 
however. In particular, German enterprises’ ex -
ports to non- euro area countries was subdued. 
Against this background, industrial investment 
also remained lacklustre.
In order to counteract heightened downside 
risks to price stability in the euro area, the 
ECB Governing Council decided in March 2016 
to decrease the interest rate on the deposit fa -
cility further to -0.40%, to raise the monthly 
purchase volume of the expanded asset pur -
chase programme (APP) from €60 billion to 
€80 billion starting in April 2016, and to in -
clude corporate bonds in the purchase pro -
gramme starting in June 2016. At the same 
time, four new targeted longer- term refinan -
cing operations were announced, each with a 
maturity of four years, starting in June 2016. 
Against the backdrop of persistently weak in -
flation dynamics, the ECB  Governing Council 
decided in December 2016 to maintain its ex -
pansionary monetary policy stance and, from 
April 2017, to continue the net asset purchases 
at the reduced pace of €60 billion until Decem -
ber 2017 at least. Moreover, it decided to de -
crease the minimum residual maturity period 
for the public sector purchase programme from 
two years to one year and to also permit pur -
chases of securities with a yield (to maturity) below the interest rate on the deposit facility, 
to the extent necessary, with both decisions ef -
fective as of January 2017.
On 11 March 2016, the Act Implementing the 
Mortgage Credit Directive and Amending Ac -
counting Rules (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der 
Wohnimmobilienkreditrichtlinie und zur Ände -
rung handelsrechtlicher Vorschriften)  entered 
into force. Article 7 amended the measurement 
approach pursuant to the German Commercial 
Code for pension provisions with a residual 
maturity  of more than one year. The revised 
version extended the reference period used to 
calculate the average discount rate. For most 
banks, the one- off effect stemming from the 
first application of the amended discounting 
rules led to reversals of provisions or to signifi -
cantly lower transfer amounts and thus bene -
fited the annual results considerably (further 
information on this topic can be found in the 
box on page 55). According to the information 
contained in the annual reports of 30 institu -
tions belonging to different categories of 
banks,2 in which nearly two- thirds of the ag -
gregate total assets of the German banking 
system are concentrated, the cost savings of 
these institutions came to a total of €3.0 billion 
in the reporting year. According to the state -
ment issued by the Institute of Public Auditors 
in Germany (IDW) on the accounting for pen -
sion obligations pursuant to the German Com -
mercial Code (IDW RS HFA 30), reporting par -
ties can choose whether to disclose effects on 
profit and loss stemming from a change in the 
discount rate together with changes in fair 
value and current income from plan assets

Methodological notes
Data based on individual accounts in 
 accordance with the German  Commercial Code and on monthly  balance sheet 
 statistics
The results from the profi  t and loss accounts 
are based on the published annual reports of the individual institutions in accordance with 
the provisions set forth in the German Com-
mercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, or HGB) 
and the Regulation on the Accounting of Credit 
Institutions ( Verordnung über die Rechnungs-
legung der Kreditinstitute, or RechKredV). They 
differ in terms of their conception, structure 
and defi  nitions from the internationally cus-tomary IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) accounting standards
1 for capital 
market- oriented banking groups, which means 
that – from a methodological viewpoint – the 
respective business results and certain balance 
sheet or individual profi  t and loss items are not 
comparable across the national and inter-
national accounting frameworks.
For reasons of comparability within Germany, it 
is advisable to consider the individual accounts 
when analysing fi  nancial performance. Using group accounts would make a meaningful 
analysis  diffi   cult as, fi  rst, many German banks 
are not part of a group, meaning that their in-dividual accounts drawn up in accordance with the German Commercial Code would still have 
to be used; second, the accounts of capital market- oriented groups are prepared accord-
ing to international accounting standards.
The fi  gures for balance sheet capital (total 
equity), total assets and other stock variables 
are not obtained from the annual reports but 
are taken as annual average values on the basis of the monthly balance sheet statistics 
reported for the institution as a whole.
Reporting group
The reporting group for statistics on banks’ 
profi  t and loss accounts (profi  t and loss statis-
tics) includes all banks that are both monetary 
fi  nancial institutions and credit institutions as 
defi  ned in the German Banking Act (Kredit-
wesengesetz, or KWG), as well as being domi-
ciled in Germany. Branches of foreign banks that are exempted from the provisions of sec-
tion 53 of the Banking Act, banks in liquid-
ation and banks with a fi  nancial year under 12 
months (truncated fi  nancial year) are not in-
cluded in this performance analysis.
Elimination of the category “regional 
 institutions of credit cooperatives”
As in the monthly balance sheet statistics, the 
category “regional institutions of credit co-
operatives” is no longer reported separately in 
the profi  t and loss statistics for data protection 
reasons. The earnings data of “DZ  Bank 
AG  Deutsche Zentral- Genossenschaftsbank, 
Frankfurt am Main”, which was created in July 
2016 through the merger between “DZ Bank AG  Deutsche Zentral- Genossenschaftsbank, 
Frankfurt am Main” and “WGZ BANK AG West-deutsche Genossenschafts- Zentralbank, Düssel-dorf”, are included in the category “Banks with special, development and other central support 
tasks” in the long- term internet time series from the reporting year 2016 onwards. How-
ever, in the tables and charts, as well as in the 
tables accompanying this Monthly Report art-
icle, they are assigned to this category for the 
entire period under observation (2007 to 2016).
Calculation of the long- term averageAt the launch of European monetary union in 
1999, the reporting group relevant for calcu-
lating the money supply and for monetary an-
alysis was uniformly defi  ned by the ECB for 
the euro area as a whole and referred to as the monetary fi  nancial institutions (MFI) sec-tor. Unlike the population of banks used for the Bundesbank analysis up to that time, building and loan associations are also in-cluded. Except where another time period is 
explicitly mentioned, the calculations with re-
gard to the longer- term average cover the 
years since the launch of European monetary union, ie from 1999 to 2016.
1 IFRS- based fi  nancial statements are of relevance, for 
instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and 
oversight, concentrating on systemically important banks 
and their international business activities (including their 
foreign subsidiaries). For details, see Deutsche Bundes-

interest income or other operating income). 
The changes to the rules therefore affected dif -
ferent parts of the profit and loss account, de -
pending on the reporting practice chosen by 
the banks. The majority of the 30 banks recog -
nised the effects on profit and loss in other 
operat ing income, which thus saw savings of 
around €1.5 billion.
Alongside the ongoing low- interest- rate envir -
onment, banks are also facing challenges from 
advances in the digitalisation of financial ser -
vices. Changing customer behaviour, growing 
competition from companies with innovative 
IT- based business models (fintechs), and the 
need for higher investment in IT security are 
compounding competitive and cost pressures. 
However, the expansion of digital distribution 
platforms with tailored new branch concepts 
as well as the combination of digital solutions 
with established brands and mature customer 
bases offer significant potential for future effi -
ciency gains.The process of consolidation in the German 
banking sector accelerated in the reporting 
year. In the course of the year, the total num -
ber of credit institutions covered by statistics on 
the profit and loss accounts fell by 68, of which 
59 banks alone were attributable to the pri -
mary institutions. The following figures are 
therefore based on a reporting group compris -
ing 1,611 institutions with aggregate total 
assets of €8.4 trillion.
Net interest income down 
perceptibly
Net interest income accounts for 73.2% of 
oper ating income on a long-  term average, 
making it by far the most important source of 
income for German banks. Aside from the con -
tribution to earnings made by actual interest-  
bearing business,3 the sum of current income4 
and income from profit transfers5 also forms 
part of net interest income. These compara -
tively volatile earnings components contribute 
roughly 20% to net interest income on a long- 
term average, but relate mainly to the big 
banks with international operations. In the re -
porting year, the aggregate net interest income 
for all banks declined by 4.9% to €91.1 billion 
(71.2% of operating income). This was largely 
due to the lower sum of current income and 
income from profit transfers, which was down 
by 17.3% to €14.7 billion. The contribution to 
earnings made by actual interest- bearing busi -
ness –  net interest income in the narrower 
sense  – contracted by 2.1% to €76.4 billion.

New discounting methodology for calculating pension 
obligations 
The Act Implementing the Mortgage Credit 
Directive and Amending Accounting Rules 
(Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Wohnimmobi-lienkreditrichtlinie und zur Änderung han-delsrechtlicher Vorschriften) entered into 
force on 11 March 2016. Article 7 amended the measurement approach pursuant to the 
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch) for pension provisions with a residual 
maturity of more than one year. Pension 
obligations are liabilities that are likely to be 
incurred in the future, and provisions need 
to be set aside for these – discounted to 
their present value. These provisions are re-corded as debt in the balance sheet. Trans-
fers to pension provisions can be recorded 
as staff costs, interest paid or other operat-ing expenses, and thus diminish the annual result.
The reference period for calculating the dis-
count rate was adjusted in the revised and 
extended German Commercial Code of 
11 March 2016. The rate used to discount 
the amount required to settle the pension 
obligations over the residual maturity period is now no longer the average market inter-
est rate over the last seven years, but over 
the last ten.
The new rule is to be applied for the fi  rst 
time to the annual accounts for the fi  nan-
cial year ending after 31 December 2015.1 
The extension of the reference period means that the higher interest rates seen 
some years ago will again be taken into ac-
count when calculating the average rate – 
at least for the next few years. This will lead to an increase in the relevant discount rates and thus to a reduction in transfers to pen-sion provisions.
2 In the short term, this has 
a favourable impact on the annual result and (assuming distributions remain stable) 
shifts the balance on the liabilities side from 
debt to equity. According to the explana-
tory memorandum, this should perceptibly mitigate the negative impact of the pro-tracted low- interest- rate environment on 
the attractiveness of occupational pensions. As this impact on profi  ts stems solely from a 
change in the law and not from the busi-
ness activity itself, and so as not to under-
mine the principle of prudence, legislators 
imposed a restriction on the distribution of 
the positive difference arising from the ap-
plication of the old and new rule.3
The fi  rst- time application of the new meas-
urement approach considerably improved the annual results for the 2016 reporting 
year. For example, if an enterprise opted to 
use the simplifi  ed rule pursuant to section 
253 (2) sentence 2 of the German Commer-
cial Code and assumed a residual maturity 
of 15 years for all pension provisions, the discount rate applicable on the reporting 
date of 31 December 2016 would be 3.24% based on an average of the previous seven 
years, and 4.01% based on an average of the previous ten years. Under the old sys-tem, a settlement amount of €100 with a 
residual maturity of 15 years would have re-quired provisions of €62 in 2016, compared 
with just €55.40 under the new system. 
Pension provisions under the new rules are thus more than 10% lower.
1 However, there is an option to already apply the new 
rule to a fi  nancial year starting after 31  December 
2014 and ending before 1 January 2016.
2 For a comparison of the projected development of 
the discount rate according to the old and new 
method, assuming interest rates persist at their current 
low levels, see German Financial Stability Committee

net interest income up by €0.7 billion at one 
big bank alone, countered a larger decrease. 
Overall, the low- interest- rate environment is 
thus still weighing on banks’ results. In order to 
gain new insights into the profitability and re -
silience of German institutions (see the box on 
pages 57 and 58), the Federal Financial Super -
visory Authority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank 
conducted a third low- interest- rate survey in 
2017, following on from its 2013 and 2015 iter -
ations.
As in previous years, banks benefited from a 
favourable funding situation. This assessment 
was also confirmed by the institutions that 
regularly participate in the Bank Lending Survey 
(BLS) conducted by the Bundesbank. The inter -
est rates on the main refinancing operations 
and on the marginal lending facility which, 
together  with the rate on the deposit facility, 
constitute the Eurosystem’s key interest rates, 
remained at their historically low levels in the 
reporting year, at 0.00% and 0.25% respect -ively. Interest rates in the interbank market, 
already  negative in the previous year, kept hit -
ting new historic lows. For unsecured money 
market transactions between banks with a 
maturity  of three months, EURIBOR (Euro Inter -
Bank Offered Rate) stood at -0.32% on average 
in December, and Eonia (Euro OverNight Index 
Average), the unsecured interbank overnight 
rate, was -0.35%. Furthermore, the ongoing 
accumulation of overnight deposits benefited 
from the continued pronounced preference for 
liquidity among households, which saw their 
financial  assets grow to €5.6 trillion by the end 
of the year. Aggregated across all banks, the 
share of total assets accounted for by over -
night deposits held by domestic households 
has almost tripled since 2007 to 13%. This 
develop ment played a major role in the consid -
erable overall increase in the share of overnight 
deposits held by non- banks, which rose to 
almost  one- quarter of total assets during this 
period.Favourable

Overview of the results of the 2017 low-interest-rate survey
Following two surveys in 2013 and 2015, 
the Bundesbank and the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) this year con-ducted a third survey among roughly 1,500 
small and medium- sized German credit in-
stitutions that are directly overseen by na-tional supervisors on their profi  tability and resilience in the low- interest- rate environ-
ment.
The aim of the survey was to gain a com-
prehensive insight into the profi  t outlook of German credit institutions and to identify at 
an early stage potential risks that might 
arise, above all, in a setting of persistently 
low interest rates. The survey results will be taken into account in future supervisory ac-tivities.
The fi  rst part of the survey was used to ob-
tain the credit institutions’ planning and 
forecast data as well as earnings simula-tions for fi  ve interest rate scenarios that were defi  ned by the supervisors (constant interest rate level, positive interest rate 
shock, negative interest rate shock, inverse 
turn in the yield curve based on a static bal-
ance sheet assumption and negative inter-
est rate shock based on a dynamic balance 
sheet assumption) over the period 2017 to 
2021.
The evaluations show that the low- interest- 
rate environment continues to put German credit institutions under considerable strain, particularly those with business models that 
are predominantly reliant on interest in-come. All in all, the institutions expect to 
see a 9% drop in their profi  t for the fi  nan-
cial year before tax by 2021. Based on planned balance sheet growth of around 
10% over the same period, this corresponds 
to a 16% decline in their return on assets 
(profi  t for the fi  nancial year before tax as a share of total assets). In the previous survey, 
which was conducted in 2015, banks had anticipated a 25% decrease. The main drivers of the banks’ current assessment are expectations of higher burdens arising from 
value adjustments as well as a marked de-
cline in net interest income. Faced with 
ever- narrower margins in interest business, 
the institutions plan to increasingly tap al-ternative sources of income. For instance, net commission income is expected to make a signifi  cant contribution to stabilis-
ing their results in future. In addition, trans-
fers to the fund for general banking risks are expected to decline over the planning 
horizon. Under the planning scenario, pass-ing on negative interest rates on deposits is 
currently an option for only around one in 
four banks.
On the expenditure side, action is to be 
taken to keep the increase in administrative 
spending signifi  cantly below the expansion 
in total assets. But despite these efforts, banks expect the cost/ income ratio to rise considerably over the planning horizon to 2021, from an average of 63% of late to 
72%.
The simulations for the fi  ve interest rate scenarios defi  ned by the supervisors show that a signifi  cantly sharper drop in results would have to be expected assuming a continuing or increasingly worsening low- interest- rate environment and an inverse turn in the yield curve while assuming a 
static balance sheet. On the whole, the re-
turn on assets (based on a static balance sheet assumption in each case) would fall 
by around 40%, and by as much as around 
60% assuming a negative interest rate 
shock, although as many as around two out 
of three institutions stated that the pass- through of negative interest on deposits had already been factored into this scen-ario. Under the assumption of a positive 
interest rate shock, a slump in profi  ts due to 
value adjustments would have to be ex-
pected in the short term. However, the ori-
ginal level would be exceeded by as much Deutsche Bundesbank

The importance of market- based funding for 
German banks has been steadily declining over 
the past few years.7 The favourable liquidity 
position and the ongoing targeted balance 
sheet reductions at capital market-  oriented 
Landesbanken and mortgage banks were key 
factors in this. The downward trend did not 
continue in the reporting year, however, with 
negotiable debt securities still accounting for 
around 15% of total assets, as in the previous 
year. At €19.8 billion on balance, more debt 
securities  were actually issued than redeemed 
in the long- term maturity segment (maturity of 
more than four years) for the first time since 
2006. The yields on short- dated debt securities, 
which were negative throughout the year, are 
likely to have supported demand for bonds 
with longer residual maturity periods, the yields 
on which rebounded from the zero interest 
mark into clearly more positive territory, espe -
cially in the final quarter.The Eurosystem’s extensive asset purchases as 
part of the APP were the chief cause of an in -
crease in balances held with the central bank 
on the assets side of the banks’ balance sheets. 
At the aggregate level, excess liquidity8 thus 
saw a further strong rise and made up around 
5% of the cumulative total assets of German 
banks at the end of the reporting year, amount -
ing to just under €400 billion in the German 
banking sector. The banks’ excess balances 
held with the central bank are remunerated at 
the deposit facility rate. Altogether, German 
banks paid €1.05 billion in negative interest on 
their excess liquidity held with the Bundesbank, 
which was four times the amount in the previ -
ous year.9Decline in 
market- based fundingMassive increase in excess liquidity as 7% in the medium to long term because 
of the easing pressure on margins.
Once again, the survey was supplemented 
by a stress test covering not only interest 
rate risk but credit and market risk as well. The aim here was to test the credit institu-
tions’ resilience in a status quo scenario, 
taking into account additional stress factors 
such as an abrupt interest rate reversal, an 
increase in the number of defaults in the credit portfolio as well as a sudden rise in 
credit spreads or falling asset prices. Over a one- year stress horizon the aggregate Com-mon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio would fall by 
just under 3  percentage points, from 16.24% at end-2016 to 13.29% at end-2017, the main drivers being value effects 
on interest- bearing positions as a result of 
rising interest rates and credit spreads. The 
European Central Bank will use the stress test results in Pillar 2 Guidance as part of 
the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Pro-cess (SREP) to determine the prudential tar-get equity ratio. Institutions that are espe-
cially vulnerable are subjected to intensifi  ed supervision.
For the fi  rst time, the survey also gathered 
data on other side effects of the low- interest- rate environment. In this respect, 
the main focus was on residential mortgage 
lending and the development of credit 
standards.
In order to assess how a potential price cor-
rection in the housing market would affect 
banks’ capital levels, a residential property 
stress test was conducted on the basis of 
the data collected.1

interest- rate survey and the stress tests is available on

Negative interest rates on asset items are one 
aspect of the debate surrounding credit institu -
tions’ diminishing earnings potential. These are 
increasingly counterbalanced by interest re -
ceived from liability items, however. Therefore, 
it only makes sense to perform an overall analy -
sis. To this end, the annual reports of 30 banks, 
which were already examined to discern the 
impact of the adjustment to the measurement 
of pension obligations, were also reviewed for 
information on positive and negative interest. 
According to the reports, these credit institu -
tions paid €1.55 billion in interest on asset- side 
items in the reporting year (after €0.61 billion 
in the previous year) and received €1.29 billion in interest on liability- side items (after €0.42 bil -
lion in the previous year). These were mainly 
liabilities to banks and institutional depositors. 
Since the larger amounts affected the income 
and expenditure sides in nearly equal measure, 
the resulting net expense of €0.27 billion was 
only €0.09 billion higher than in the previous 
year. The result was unevenly distributed, how -
ever: 11 banks recorded net income of €0.13 
billion in total, one bank reported equal 
amounts of positive and negative interest, and 
18 banks posted a total net expense of €0.40 
billion.Negative

The Eurosystem’s ongoing expansionary mon -
etary policy stance and the high volume of 
asset purchases again drove down the low 
interest rate level in the money market and 
capital market. The very flat German yield 
curve10 thus shifted even more clearly into 
negative territory over the course of the year. 
Thus far, however, the zero lower bound neces-
sitated by business policy and competition has 
prevented the negative interest rate level from 
being passed through on a broad scale – par -
ticularly for deposits held by the private non-  
financial sector. According to the harmonised 
MFI interest rate statistics, the interest rate on 
the overnight deposits of domestic households 
only fell by 0.05  percentage point to 0.07% 
over the course of the year, while the rate for 
new long- term loans to households for house 
purchase decreased more distinctly over the 
same period, dropping by 0.32  percentage 
point to 1.73%. This put increasing pressure on 
margins at the savings banks and credit co -
operatives, in particular, which have business 
models geared towards  traditional lending 
business and maturity   transformation and 
where overnight deposits of domestic house -
holds as well as long- term loans for house pur -
chase account for a much greater share of total 
assets than in most other categories of banks, 
at around 30% each.The shortening of maturities on the liabilities 
side associated with the growing concentration 
on overnight deposit products meant that 
more and more loans with long interest rate 
lock- in periods were financed on a very short- 
term basis. Aggregated across all banks, the 
share of long- term loans to non- banks has 
grown only slightly since 2007, to 30% of total 
assets, while in the same period the share of 
overnight deposits held by non- banks has 
doubled to just under one- quarter of total 
assets. For the primary institutions, the share of 
long-  term loans to non-  banks has risen by 
7  percentage points to 58% in the savings 
bank sector and by 6 percentage points to 55% 
in the cooperative bank sector since 2007. In 
contrast to this, the volume of overnight de -
posits held by non- banks doubled in the same 
period to account for almost half of total 
assets. All other things being equal, this bal -
ance sheet structure may give rise to height -
ened liquidity and interest rate risk, but also to 
higher earnings owing to the greater contribu -
tion of maturity transformation.11
The declining trading portfolio volume in the 
big banks sector, the continued balance sheet 
reduction at the Landesbanken, and the 
winding- up of a major mortgage bank were 
the main factors behind the decrease in total 
assets in these three categories of banks. In the 
other categories, business expansions led to an 
increase. The aggregate total assets across all 
categories of banks contracted on balance by 
2.9% to €8.4 trillion. The interest margin, cal -
culated as the ratio of net interest income to 
total assets, shrank marginally to 1.09%.12 The

related business to interest- bearing assets,13 
also fell just slightly, to 1.52%. For the primary 
institutions, in particular, where traditional de -
posit and lending business play a major role, 
the development of interest margins can pro -
vide a key indication of their general profitabil -
ity. In these categories of banks, interest-  
bearing assets account for around 80% of total 
assets, a much higher share than for most of 
the other categories. Because of their business 
model, which focuses on traditional lending 
business and maturity transformation, the pri -
mary institutions have the highest interest mar -
gins of all the categories of banks. As a result 
of the low- interest- rate environment and com -
petition, margins in both categories of banks 
have been contracting for years. In the report -
ing year, they stood at 1.96% in the savings 
bank sector and 1.99% in the cooperative bank 
sector, falling short of the 2% threshold for the 
first time since the introduction of the profit 
and loss statistics, and also standing far below 
their prior- year levels of 2.06% and 2.14% re -spectively. In the narrower sense, too, interest 
margins were distinctly down.
The structural decline in lending that was 
feared in the run- up to the transposition into 
national law of the Mortgage Credit Directive 
was not observed in the aggregate. Loans to 
households for house purchase, with an annual 
growth rate of 3.7%, were again the main 
driver of the marked increase in the volume of 
loans to households. This growth was sup -
ported by stable consumer confidence as well 
as by the extremely favourable funding costs. 
On the back of renewed price rises for residen -
tial properties, households’ high stocks of finan-
cial assets are likely to have prevented an even 
larger increase in the volume of loans for house 
purchase.Persistent

Lending business with domestic non- financial 
corporations also saw a marked expansion, 
with an annual growth rate of 2.5%. The larg -
est growth by far was recorded in the long-  
term maturity segment. Crucial factors in this 
are likely to have been the exceptionally low 
interest rates charged on these loans coupled 
with the underlying positive economic expect -
ations. Nonetheless, the upward trend in loans 
to enterprises was dampened by industrial in -
vestment, which remains muted, and by the 
use of alternative sources of funding, particu -
larly enterprises’ own funds.
Net interest income, 
by category  of banks
In the globally active big banks sector, current 
income and income from profit transfers, which 
in total makes up almost half of net interest 
income on a long- term average, are tradition -
ally more relevant to operating business than in 
the other categories of banks. As against the 
previous year, this contribution decreased by a 
little more than one- quarter to €7.4 billion. The 
net result from interest- bearing business, on 
the other hand, benefited from the positive 
one- off effect stemming from the adjustment 
to the measurement of pension obligations at 
one big bank, rising by 4.5% to €12.7 billion. 
Overall, the net interest income of big banks 
fell by 9.1% to €20.1 billion (62.1% of operating 
income).
In the Landesbank sector, which is affected by 
restructuring measures, the decline in net inter -
est income by 8.4% to €7.5 billion (74.8% of 
operating income) was primarily due to the 
continued balance sheet reduction. At 0.77%, 
the interest margin was slightly higher than the 
previous year’s level. At the mortgage banks, 
net interest income, which had benefited from 
one- off effects at one bank in the previous 
year, shrank by almost one- third to €1.6 billion. 
With total assets down by nearly one- quarter, 
the contraction of the interest margin to 0.54% 
was thus comparatively moderate. Since net interest income is virtually the only source of 
income for mortgage banks owing to their spe -
cialised business model, its share in operating 
income slightly exceeded the 100% mark be -
cause of the negative net commission income.
The primary institutions, which have so far 
been able to stabilise their net interest income 
by increasing their lending volumes and matur -
ities, recorded significant decreases. In the sav -
ings bank sector, net interest income shrank by 
2.7% to €22.7 billion (76.4% of operating in -
come) and in the cooperative bank sector it 
was down by 2.9% to €16.6 billion (76.5% of 
operating income). As previously mentioned, 
their interest margins were below 2% for the 
first time. Mainly as a result of an improved net 
result from current income and income from 
profit transfers, the regional banks and other 
commercial banks increased their net interest 
income by 3.9% to €14.4 billion (65.5% of 
oper ating income). On the back of significantly 
expanded total assets, the interest margin in 
this category of banks, which is also heavily 
dependent  on deposit funding, dropped slightly 
to 1.52%. Given their specialised business 
model, the net interest income of building and 
loan associations fell by 11.9% to €2.5 billion 
(92.1% of operating income), reaching a new 
historic low. With total assets marginally higher, 
the interest margin narrowed distinctly to 
1.16%.
Commission margin stable
Net commission income particularly comprises 
fees for giro transactions and payments as well 
as for securities and safe custody business, and 
remuneration for brokerage activities relating 
to loan contracts, savings agreements, savings 
and loan agreements, and insurance contracts. 
Accounting for 22.3% of operating income on 
a long- term average, it is the second most im -
portant source of income, after net interest in -
come, in operating business, and has the effect 
of stabilising earnings in the low-  interest-  rate 
environment. More and more banks are down -Marked increase

sizing their offering of free services, especially 
those concerning payments and account man -
agement, in pursuit of fair and proportional pri -
cing. Depending on the business model, how -
ever, the areas of activity, the scale and the 
nature of commission- related business differ 
significantly. Driven by the marked decline in 
the big banks sector, net commission income 
aggregated across all banks decreased by 2.3% 
to €29.8 billion (23.3% of operating income). 
However, the commission margin, calculated 
as the ratio of net commission income to total 
assets, marginally exceeded the prior- year fig -
ure and, at 0.36%, matched the long- term 
average.
The relevance of net commission income to op -
erating business has steadily increased over re -
cent years, especially among primary institu -
tions. In the reporting year, net commission in -
come rose only slightly in the savings bank sec -
tor, however, to €7.0 billion (23.5% of operating 
income) and remained steady at the previous 
year’s level in the cooperative bank sector, at 
€4.6 billion (21.1% of operating income). In the 
Landesbank  sector, net commission income im -
proved by almost one- quarter to €1.2 billion 
(12.1% of operating income). This was essen -
tially due to the marked decline in expenses for 
the provision of government guarantees for 
one Landesbank. As for big banks which have 
a heavy business focus on the international 
capital markets and generated just over 36% of 
net commission income aggregated across all 
categories of banks, their net commission re -
sult fell by 8.0% to €10.8 billion (33.4% of op -
erating income). This was mainly due to nega -
tive developments in lending and securities 
business and to a one- off factor at one big 
bank in connection with the remuneration of 
services within the bank’s group. For building 
and loan associations, the lower levels of new 
business were a key factor in the drop in the 
structurally negative net commission income by 
14.8% to €0.5 billion. Unlike most other cat -
egories of banks, building and loan associ -
ations hardly receive any commission income, 
but primarily book commissions paid for con -tracts concluded and brokerage by distribution 
partners.
Trading result well below the 
previous year’s level
The trading result, which declined by €0.7 bil -
lion in the reporting year to €3.0 billion, is a 
highly volatile income component with (in the 
long- term average) a relatively low share of op -
erating income of just 2.7%. According to the 
published annual reports, the trading result 
does not stem from proprietary trading origin -
ating in the institutions but rather primarily 
from business on behalf of customers. It is pre -
dominantly big banks and Landesbank  that 
generate profit contributions in this case. While 
the trading result in the Landesbank sector al -
most doubled to €1.0 billion, it dropped by 
more than half to €1.1 billion in the big banks 
sector.

past years, income had been strongly reduced 
mainly by provisions for litigation and recourse 
risks as well as the costs of allocation to pen -
sion obligations, which had steadily risen in the 
prevailing low- interest- rate environment This 
changed in the reporting year. The other oper -
ating result improved significantly from -€2.2 
billion to €4.1 billion and almost reached 
double its long- term average, with a 3.2% 
share of operating income. Key factors behind 
this were the €2.8 billion lower expenses in 
connection with one big bank’s legal disputes 
and the positive one- off effect of the legislative 
amendment in the valuation of pension obliga -
tions, which benefited all categories of banks. In addition, the reported withdrawals from the 
fund required by the building and loan associ -
ation rules ( Fonds zur bauspartechnischen Ab -
sicherung,  FbtA) increased income by €0.6 bil -
lion. Building and loan associations took ad -
vantage of the greater flexibility regarding the 
use of this fund ushered in by the amended 
Building and Loan Associations Act (Bauspar -
kassengesetz)  and the Regulation concerning 
Building and Loan Associations (Bausparkas -
sen- Verordnung)  that came into force at the 
end of 2015.14 The original purpose of the FbtA 
was to ensure consistent waiting times, to be 
kept as short as possible, between the start of 
the home loan savings agreement and its allo -
cation, even in times when liquidity is scarce 
for lack of new deposits with building and loan 
associations. The amendment to the legislation 
means that withdrawals can also be made from 
the FbtA to offset falling income in the current 
low- interest- rate environment. In the context 
of profit appropriation, these amounts were 
largely transferred to the fund for general 
banking risks to help strengthen the balance 
sheet capital base (total equity).
Big banks’ other operating result, which had 
had a strongly negative balance for years, im -
proved significantly by €4.1 billion, moving into 
positive territory at €0.4 billion. Building and 
loan associations stepped up their result from 
€0.0 billion to €0.7 billion, thereby reaching by 
far the highest value in the reporting year since 
1999. The improvement for savings banks by 
€0.3 billion, edging just into positive territory, 
and for credit cooperatives by €0.4 billion to 
€0.5 billion are likely related chiefly to the one- 
off effect that arose from the valuation adjust -
ment of pension obligations.Other operating

Administrative spending 
down slightly
The banks’ cost side is largely determined by 
administrative spending, which comprises staff 
costs and other administrative spending.15 Total 
administrative spending fell slightly by 1.5% to 
€88.7 billion only as a consequence of declin -
ing staff costs. The ratio to total assets was 
slightly above the long- term average, at 1.06%.
Staff costs, which not only include wage and 
salary payments but also social security contri -
butions and operating expenses for pensions, 
decreased by 3.1% to €44.6 billion. This mainly 
affected the cost item for pension obligations, 
which dropped by 27.7% to €2.7 billion as a 
result of the positive one- off effect stemming 
from the amended measurement approach. 
These expenses were down by around one-  
third for primary institutions, building and loan 
associations and for regional and other com -
mercial banks, whereas in the Landesbank  sec-
tor they even plummeted by almost 90% to 
just €0.1 billion. By contrast, big banks doubled 
their transfers by €0.5 billion to €1.0 billion 
while reducing their wage and salary payments 
by €0.8 billion to €8.9 billion.
Concomitant with a renewed drop in the num -
ber of employees in the banking sector and 
moderate rises in pay agreements, wage and 
salary payments (including variable compon -
ents) were down slightly by €0.4 billion to 
€36.1 billion. The significant decline in the big 
banks sector and for mortgage banks was by 
and large offset by the mostly small increases 
for other categories of banks.
Other administrative spending includes not 
only the costs of maintaining the branch net -
work and the bank levy but also non- staff costs 
as well as expenditure on external services such 
as legal, auditing and consultancy costs and 
the costs of IT services. This spending stood at 
the previous year’s level at €44 billion. The re -
duction in the number of branches that has 
been underway for years appears to have had only a limited cost- reducing effect for primary 
institutions in particular. The successes already 
achieved here from savings and synergy effects 
are likely to have been offset partly by increased 
investment needs for IT infrastructure and se -
curity in connection with the launch of new 
online banking services. In the savings bank 
sector, other administrative spending narrowed 
slightly to €7.5 billion, while there was a mar -
ginal increase in the cooperative bank sector to 
€5.8 billion. The ratio to total assets was some -
what more favourable than in the previous year 
for both categories of banks. The decrease in 
spending in the big banks sector, which was 
predominantly caused by the lower charges 
from the group accounts for one bank, con -
trasted with an increase in spending for Lan -
desbanken as well as for regional and other 
commercial banks.Administrative

The cost/ income ratio, calculated as the ratio of 
administrative spending to operating income, 
can provide an important indication of how 
cost effective a company is. The lower this 
ratio, the more operating income is left over 
after deducting administrative spending, ie the 
more efficiently the company has been operat -
ing. In the reporting year, the efficiency of the 
German banking sector measured in this man -
ner improved by 1.2  percentage points to 
69.2%. This reduced administrative spending 
used to generate €100 of operating income by 
€1.20. German banks continue to have a very 
high cost/ income ratio compared to its long-  term average, and also by international stand -
ards, however.
For years, big banks have been among the cat -
egories of banks with the lowest cost efficiency. 
Since administrative spending fell more strongly 
than operating income, the cost/ income ratio 
of 81.4% was somewhat lower than the previ -
ous year, though it did still exceed the long-  
term average for this category of banks. With 
lower operating income and administrative 
spending, savings banks and credit coopera -
tives hovered within the usual range at 67.8% 
and 66.6% respectively. The Landesbanken im -
proved their cost efficiency on the back of a 
rise in operating income and a drop in adminis -
trative spending, reducing their cost/ income 
ratio to 63.5%. They were still far off the much 
more favourable long- term average, however. 
As a result of negative one- off factors, the cost/ 
income ratio increased significantly for mort -
gage banks to 61% compared both to the pre -
vious year and to the long- term average.
Net transfers to risk provi -
sions expanded considerably
The net valuation result comprises the effects 
of value adjustments, write-  ups and write-  
downs on accounts receivable and securities in 
the liquidity reserve. In addition, income and 
charges in connection with transfers from and 
to loan- loss provisions16 are taken into account, 
as are transfers and releases relating to undis -
closed reserves pursuant to section 340 f of the 
German Commercial Code. The net valuation 
result makes use of the cross- offsetting op -
tion17 permissible under the German Commer -
cial Code. Reallocations within the fund for Slight improve-

general banking risks pursuant to section 340g 
of the German Commercial Code are not re -
corded in the profit and loss account, but are 
recognised only in the context of profit appro -
priation as part of the present profit and loss 
analysis .
The net valuation result departed from its his -
torically favourable level, deteriorating by €5.3 
billion to -€8.8 billion. In terms of the ratio to 
total assets, at -0.11% it was nevertheless still 
notably better than the long- term average. The 
level of heterogeneity between and even within 
bank categories was very large in some cases. 
The difficult market situation for shipping 
loans18 prompted very high write- downs, espe -
cially for certain big banks and Landesbanken. 
Following a marginal net income in the previ -
ous year, the big banks sector’s net valuation 
result flipped to a net loss of -€4.0 billion. Its 
ratio to total assets fell to -0.16%, thereby once 
again reaching the long-  term average for this 
category of banks. Landesbanken transferred 
€3.7 billion to their credit risk provisions, more 
than three times the previous year’s amount. 
With a ratio to total assets of -0.38%, they 
occupied  last place among all of the categories 
of banks and performed significantly worse 
than their long- term average. In the case of 
mortgage banks, the improvement in the net 
valuation result by €0.2 billion to -€0.1 billion 
was primarily linked to the exclusion of one 
liquid ated bank. At -0.04%, the ratio to total 
assets was several times more favourable than 
the long- term average for this category of 
banks. The primary institutions that focus their 
business chiefly on lending to households 
benefited from the positive economic condi -
tions and the low risk provisioning in the pri -
vate banking business. Because the income 
from the liquidation of value adjustments was 
again higher than the depreciation charge, sav -
ings banks recorded a positive net valuation 
result  for the sixth time in succession (€1.0 bil -
lion), which was also more than 11 times higher 
than the previous year. The net valuation result 
for credit cooperatives improved from -€0.5 bil -
lion to €0.1 billion. The marginal positive net valuation result of €0.02 billion for building and 
loan associations largely resulted from one in -
stitution’s valuation gains.
Declining operating result
Aggregated across all banks, the operating 
result  after valuation of assets (operating result) 
narrowed by €3.8 billion to €30.6 billion. The 
ratio to total assets, which were likewise down, 
was nevertheless only slightly lower at 0.37%. 
Compared to other categories of banks, Lan -
desbanken had the lowest operating result. 
Owing to the extremely high net valuation 
charges, its operating result even moved slightly 
into negative territory. The operating result in 
the big banks sector experienced a massive Negative impact

one- third of the previous year’s value. Meas -
ured in terms of their total assets, big banks 
achieved second- to- last place among the cat -
egories of banks, with 0.08%. Primary institu -
tions benefited from the extremely favourable 
growth in the valuation result and significantly 
increased their operating result. The ratio of 
operating result to total assets was therefore 
once again substantially better for savings 
banks at 0.92% and credit cooperatives at 
0.88% than for all other categories of banks.

The balance shown in the other and extraor -

also the result from financial investment busi -

corded here,21 as they cannot be assigned to 
actual operating business. Overall, the structur -
ally negative balance was reduced by €5.0 bil -
lion to €2.8 billion. This improvement was 
mainly due to the gain from the complete 
liquid ation of a mortgage bank, recorded as 
extraordinary income, which strengthened the 
parent company in the big banks sector with 
€3.9 billion. Big banks thus reported a positive 
balance again for the first time since 2007. The

more than triple expansion of the Landesban -
ken deficit to €0.5 billion was primarily attribut -
able to one large Landesbank write- down on a 
subsidiary also from the Landesbanken cat -
egory. Both Landesbanken have been heavily 
affected by the negative effects of the ongoing 
shipping crisis.
Marked improvement in 
profit for the financial year 
before tax
Largely shaped by positive one- off effects 
stemming from operating business and the 
extraordinary account, the aggregated profit 
for the financial year before tax was up by 
4.6% to €27.8 billion despite a significant in -
crease in risk provisioning. Developments were 
mixed across all categories of banks. The big 
banks sector experienced an improvement in 
profit for the financial year before tax by 16.1% 
to €3.1 billion. On account of the extremely 
favour  able development in the net valuation 
result, profit for the financial year before tax 
also increased by 15.2% to €7.7 billion for 
credit cooperatives and by 13.8% to €10.2 bil -
lion for savings banks. Thus, both categories 
again exceeded their long- term averages con -
siderably. In the case of building and loan asso -
ciations, the one- off accounting factor in the 
other operating result was a key driver in more 
than doubling the profit for the financial year 
before tax to €0.9 billion. Mortgage banks re -
corded a profit for the financial year of €0.5 
billion, a reduction of more than one- third. Of 
the nine Landesbanken, seven recorded profits 
for the financial year before tax totalling €2.1 
billion. However, they were more than offset 
by the extremely high losses for the financial 
year before tax of €2.7 billion recorded by two 
of the Landesbanken particularly affected by 
the shipping crisis. Consequently, the result at 
the category level tumbled from €1.8 billion to 
-€0.5 billion.Appropriation of profit for 
the financial year
After deducting €7.8 billion taxes on income 
and the net loss brought forward of €4.2 bil -
lion, which mainly focused on individual banks 
with special, development and other central 
support tasks, individual mortgage banks and 
regional and other commercial banks, this left 
on balance a profit for the financial year of 
€15.8 billion. In order to hedge against the 
special risks of banking business and to further 
increase regulatory equity capital, €10.8 billion 
net (compared with €7.3 billion in the previous 
year) was transferred to the fund for general 
banking risks. Primary institutions in particular 
strengthened their capital positions (total 
equity). As in previous years, the savings bank 
sector (€5.4 billion) and the cooperative bank 
sector (€3.6 billion) transferred most of their 
net profit for the financial year to this fund. Re -
serves were increased by €0.6 billion net. The 
balance sheet capital (total equity) from the 
profit for the financial year aggregated across 
all banks was therefore topped up by €11.4 bil -
lion net, with gross capital injections of €16.7 
billion compared with high withdrawals of €5.3 
billion.22 This mainly related to one big bank 
and two Landesbanken.
Equity and profitability
Since 2007, German banks have strengthened 
their balance sheet capital base (total equity) 
(including the fund for general banking risks) 
by around 46% to €466 billion. The equity 
ratio, calculated as the ratio of total equity to 
total assets, increased during this period from 
3.8% to 5.6%.Uneven develop-
ments across categories of banksLarge transfers

balance sheet capital base
22 When interpreting the information on total equity, it 
should be borne in mind that the amounts transferred from 
the profit for the respective financial year do not increase 
balance sheet capital until the year after the annual ac -
counts are adopted, while withdrawals from equity items 
are to be deducted from balance sheet capital at the latest 
when the annual accounts are prepared.Deutsche Bundesbank

As a result of the exclusion of a liquidated bank 
from the category of mortgage banks, this cat -
egory’s capital base fell by almost 40% (€5.6 
billion) to just €9.5 billion. The balance sheet 
equity ratio narrowed considerably to 3.3% as 
total assets declined at the same time. This 
ratio is the lowest among the categories of 
banks. At €54.0 billion, the balance sheet cap -
ital (total equity) for Landesbanken was some -
what lower than the previous year. However, 
the equity ratio improved noticeably to 5.5% 
due to decreasing total assets. All other cat -
egories of banks stepped up their balance 
sheet capital. Big banks improved their balance 
sheet equity ratio slightly to 3.5%, though 
compared with the other categories, their 
equity ratio is still low. Since the start of the 
finan cial crisis, big banks have thus barely re -
duced their level of debt. With an equity ratio 
of 8.5% for savings banks and 8.0% for credit 
cooperatives, primary institutions again had a 
better equity position compared with other 
categories.The return on assets is the ratio of profit for the 
financial year before tax to average total assets, 
documenting profitability per €100 of assets. 
This measure improved for the entire German 
banking system for the third time in succession 
by 0.02 percentage point to 0.33%. The return 
on assets only fell for Landesbanken, banks 
with special, development and other central 
support tasks and mortgage banks. Savings 
banks and credit cooperatives recorded the 
highest profitability levels in the German bank -
ing sector with ratios of 0.89% and 0.92% 
respect ively. Mortgage banks (0.18%), big 
banks (0.12%) and Landesbanken (-0.06%) had 
the lowest profitability among the categories of 
banks.
As one- off factors affect banks in isolated 
cases, it makes sense to look at the return on 
assets for individual banks separately within 
specific categories of banks. Excluding the

nificantly benefited from one- off factors, for Equity by

example, would considerably reduce the aver -
age value of the big banks sector. Omitting the 
two Landesbanken most affected by the ship -
ping crisis would push the average return on 
assets of Landesbanken noticeably into positive 
territory. In the small mortgage bank category, 
the return on assets of individual banks differed 
markedly from the average in some cases, indi -
cating an extremely heterogeneous profit situ -
ation within this category. On the other hand, 
returns on assets were all close to the average 
for primary institutions. In the case of savings 
banks, 80% of all returns on assets hovered be -
tween 0.4% and 1.3%, and between 0.6% and 
1.4% for credit cooperatives, confirming the 
high level of homogeneity in both categories.
Balance sheet profit
On balance, German banks increased their bal -
ance sheet profit by almost two- thirds to €4.4 
billion. This was principally due to one major 
bank’s withdrawals of €3 billion from its bal -
ance sheet capital (total equity) for transfer to 
the foreign parent company. The big banks sec -
tor’s balance sheet profit therefore almost 
tripled to €4.2 billion. As the two Landesban -
ken that were severely affected by the shipping 
crisis only offset just over half their enormous 
losses for the financial year by withdrawing 
€1.4 billion from the fund for general banking 
risks and the other Landesbanken transferred 
most of their profits for the financial year (€1.3 
billion) to their balance sheet capital (total 
equity), the balance sheet profit for the Landes -
bank  sector declined substantially from €0.5 
billion to -€0.9 billion. As for savings banks and 
credit cooperatives, their balance sheet profits 
changed little (€1.6 billion and €1.4 billion re -
spectively). Mortgage banks remained at the 
previous year’s level with a balance sheet loss 
of €0.7 billion. Outlook

continue to strain the profitability of German 
banks focused on interest business. This is also 
confirmed by the findings of the latest low-  
interest- rate survey of the German banking sec -
tor, according to which the profitability of 
banks and savings banks in Germany would de -
teriorate considerably if the low- interest- rate 
environment continued or intensified. The de -
cline in the return on assets would be primarily 
due to contracting margins in borrowing and 
deposit business, such as in the area of savings 
and overnight deposits.23
The shortening of maturities on the liabilities 
side also continued in the first half of 2017, 
caused especially by the increase in the volume 
of overnight deposits of the private non-  
financial sector. Even though, viewed in isol -
ation, interest rate and liquidity risks have risen, 
the higher maturity transformation is likely to 
have had a positive effect on profitability. Since 
the interest margin’s maturity transformation 
contribution constitutes a significant source of 
income for German banks, especially primary 
institutions, the increasing steepening of the yield curve is also likely to have had a favour -
able impact since the start of 2017. In July 2017, 
the monthly average of German bond yields 
with residual maturities of ten years was 0.5% 
compared to 0.3% in December 2016. The hike 
in interest rates was also reflected in banks’ 
interest rates for new lending. The rate for 
housing loans with long interest rate fixation 
periods (1.9%) in July 2017, for instance, ex -
ceeded the 2016 year- end rate by 0.2 percent -
age point. In addition to the greater earnings 
potential from the increased maturity trans -
formation, banks can also stabilise their interest 
margin by stepping up lending. Against the 
backdrop of the favourable interest rate level 
and generally positive expectations for the 
economy and business, loans to households 
(especially for house purchase) and loans to 
non- financial corporations recorded notable 
growth particularly in the long- term maturity 
category in the first half of 2017.Increase in

Changes to the investment funds statistics: 
scope enhancements, results and outlook
The Bundesbank’s investment funds statistics show the assets in which domestic funds are invested 
and the amounts of those investments, making it possible to identify structural changes over time, 
for example, and to analyse their impact. The data are also included in the national financial 
accounts. In addition, they form the German contribution to the investment fund statistics pub -
lished by the European Central Bank (ECB) and are submitted to the analysis and data production 
system of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) – the Securities Holdings Statistics Data -
base – which records the securities holdings of financial and non- financial sectors on a security- 
by- security basis.
In July 2017, domestic investment companies managed assets worth €2,100 billion. Alongside 
monetary financial institutions and insurance corporations, with respective total assets of €7,800 
billion and €2,000 billion at last count, they are therefore among the most significant financial 
intermediaries in Germany.
The assets of open- end investment funds amounted to more than €2,000 billion, with their share 
of the euro area aggregate standing at 18%. With holdings worth more than €1,500 billion, spe -
cialised funds reserved for institutional investors accounted for three- quarters of the assets of 
German open- end funds, while retail funds held the remaining €500 billion.
As a result of the changes to the Bundesbank’s investment funds statistics, extensive data on 
domestic closed- end funds are now also available. These funds, which are particularly geared to 
the acquisition of commercial real estate, managed total assets to the tune of just under €80 
billion, which corresponded to a 21% share of the value for the euro area.
Performance indices are now publicly available for the first time for securities- based retail funds; 
these funds have seen a 54% increase in value since the beginning of 2010. Broken down by cat -
egory, equity funds grew by 100%, bond funds by 26% and mixed securities funds by 31%.Deutsche Bundesbank

Investment funds statistics
The Bundesbank uses detailed information on 
investment funds for a variety of purposes. For 
example, the funds data are used for studies on 
the impact of monetary policy measures and 
for economic analyses1 as well as for studies on 
the German shadow banking system in the 
context of the Bank’s financial stability man -
date2. For instance, if liquidity and maturity 
transformation rates are high, the investment 
fund sector – being the largest player in this 
niche – may amplify potential shocks in the fi -
nancial markets during a period of stress, espe -
cially if outflows of funds are unexpectedly 
high and liquidity buffers are low.3 Data on mu -
tual fund industry trends additionally provide 
important information for capturing income 
and financial flows in the financial accounts 
and for determining cross- border capital liabil -
ities for the international investment position. 
In addition, the data collected are passed on to 
the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority 
(BaFin) for the purpose of ongoing supervision 
and, in individual cases, forwarded to the Fed -
eral Ministry of Finance.
Statistical data collected also serve as the Ger -
man contribution to the harmonised euro area 
investment fund statistics. Data on investment 
funds’ holdings of securities are also included 
in the ESCB’s Securities Holdings Statistics Data -
base, which records the securities holdings of 
financial and non- financial sectors on a security- 
by- security basis.4
The reporting obligation for the investment 
funds statistics is based on the ECB Regulation 
concerning statistics on the assets and liabilities 
of investment funds (ECB/ 2013/ 38).5 By collect -
ing these data, the euro area central banks are 
complying with their legal obligation to provide 
the ECB with data on domestic mutual funds 
for the calculation of the euro aggregates.
For each fund established, investment manage -
ment companies and externally managed in -
vestment companies within the meaning of the German Investment Code (Kapitalanlagege -
setzbuch)  report large quantities of reference 
data. As a result, funds can be broken down 
according to different criteria, eg retail and 
specialised funds, or by type of investment, ie 
categories such as equity funds, bond funds, 
real estate funds, funds of funds, money mar -
ket funds and hedge funds. Figures on the size 
and composition of each fund’s assets, their 
share units outstanding and sold, issue and re -
demption prices, inflows and outflows of 
funds, and profit distributions are also to be re -
ported on a monthly basis.6
Each month, the aggregated investment funds 
statistics are published on the Bundesbank’s 
website.7 Besides data in a tabular form, 2,500 
time series are currently available, as well as a 
factsheet with charts showing, for example, a 
breakdown of the securities held by investment 
funds. Moreover, anonymised micro data can 
be provided for academic research.8Purpose of the

Until the end of 2008, reporting agents solely 
submitted aggregate reports. It was not until 
after the harmonised collection process for 
euro area investment fund data was introduced 
that important assets position data started 
being collected at the granular level. One ex -
ample is the publication of securities holdings 
data reported on a security- by- security basis. 
The granular data collection allows for a com -
prehensive analysis of the portfolios of domes -
tic mutual funds, broken down by type of se -
curity. The detailed data also make it possible 
to respond flexibly to new requirements as well 
as to perform individual ad hoc  analyses, for 
example to determine the extent to which 
funds hold securities of particular issuers or 
how funds’ investment behaviour changes over 
time in the wake of economic developments. 
The reporting procedure does not need to be 
adapted as often, which also means reporting 
agents save on costs. While reporting agents 
previously had to submit data on their secur -
ities positions for aggregate reporting broken 
down by type of underlying instrument, by ma -
turity or by country of issuer, for example, they 
now normally only need to provide the inter -
national securities identification number and 
the notional value or number of securities held 
when reporting on a security- by- security basis. 
In addition, the prices used by the investment 
companies to determine their net asset values 
are to be reported. All other reference data on 
issuers and securities needed for conducting 
extensive analyses are provided via the Central -
ised Securities Database9 of the ESCB.

in July 2017. In principle, there is no limit to the 
number of share units an investment company 
can issue for open- end funds. Investors have 
the right to sell fund units back to the invest -
ment company at their current redemption 
price. The right of return can, however, be sub -
ject to certain conditions, such as a minimum 
holding period for share units in real estate in -
vestment funds.
With holdings worth more than €1,500 billion, 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors accounted for three- quarters of the 
assets of open- end funds. This investor group 
includes, for example, credit institutions, insur -
ance corporations, pension funds, churches and 
foundations. Funds open to the general public 
held the remaining €500 billion, the majority of 
which being attributable to retail investors.
Closing information gaps by 
enhancing scope of invest -
ment funds statistics
Due to the increased importance of securities 
data for decisions relating to monetary policy, 
financial stability as well as microprudential and 
macroprudential issues, the scope of the statis -
tics was revised at the beginning of 2015 in 
the  context of the extended ECB  Regulation ECB/ 2013/ 38 and the introduction of the Ger -
man Investment Code which also transposed 
the EU  Directive on Alternative Investment 
Fund Managers (AIFM Directive10) into national 
law. With the inclusion of closed- end funds in 
the reporting, the amendments impacted the 
group of reporting agents covered, on the one 
hand, and the content of the reports, on the 
other. For example, the previous reporting 
scope was extended in respect of information 
concerning the purpose for which developed 
land was being used and also regarding secur -
ities lending and repurchase agreements.
The enhancements to the statistics’ scope also 
included data on exchange- traded funds 
(ETFs).11 These usually track the performance of 
stock market indices and thus do not involve 
active fund management. Considering their 
cost- effective fee structures and their ability to 
be traded simply and quickly, these kinds of 
products have high growth potential. In July 
2017, the investment funds statistics included 
over 100 domestic ETFs. Almost three- quarters 
of these were established as equity funds, 
whereas the remaining share comprised pre -
dominantly bond funds. The bulk of domestic 
ETFs physically replicate the underlying index, 
while only a few synthetically reproduce it 
using swap transactions. Domestic ETFs man -
aged assets worth a total of €53 billion in July 
2017, compared with a figure of €580 billion 
for ETFs domiciled in the rest of the euro area.12
A significant change and challenge with re -
spect to the extension of the investment funds 
statistics’ scope was that closed- end funds, 
which were previously assigned to the “grey 
capital market”, were regulated by the German Specialised funds

end funds and subject to the Bundesbank’s 
statistical reporting obligations for the first 
time. The reports include data on legacy mu -

The closed- end mutual fund 
sector
In July 2017, the 3,500 closed- end funds in -
cluded in the investment funds statistics man -
aged assets worth €78 billion in total. As a 
form of long-  term collective investment, they 
primarily invest in tangible assets, such as real 
estate, land, aircraft, renewable energy plants 
and ships. In contrast to open- end mutual 
funds, share units in closed- end funds are not 
issued continuously. Instead, equity capital is 
collected during a placement phase, in which 
the investor often knows what assets are planned to be purchased. However, blind 
pools, ie funds which raise money for non-  
specified investment goals, are also common in 
the market. It is generally not possible to return 
the closed- end fund share units until the assets 
are liquidated. Investors in closed- end mutual 
funds are predominantly retail investors.
In July 2017, closed- end mutual funds held real 
estate worth €25 billion. With an investment 
amount of €20 billion, their focus was on do -
mestic land and buildings. They invested €2 bil -
lion in real estate in other euro area countries. 
The participating interests and loans to real es -
tate companies amounted to €11 billion, €8 
billion of which was accounted for by domestic 
companies and €1 billion by the rest of the 
euro area, while their equity investment in 
other companies stood at €15 billion. The Closed- end 
funds’ invest -
ment focus on tangible assetsReal estate proves most popular type of investmentCalculating performance indices for securities-based  investment funds
Performance indices make it easier to compare the 
performance of investment funds.1 It is assumed 
that distributions and other payments to the in-
vestor are reinvested in the fund. The model for this 
is based on Deutsche Börse AG’s methodology for 
calculating corresponding indices for shares2 and 
assumes that the development of redemption prices of open- end investment funds can be equated to that of share prices of public limited 
companies. Profi  t distributions and asset payouts of 
investment funds are treated like dividend and 
bonus payments of listed companies.
The performance index of an individual collective investment undertaking is therefore calculated as 
follows:
Index f,t=RNP f,t⇥KF f,t
RNP f,t=0⇥100,
where Index represents the index value, RNP the 
redemption price, KF the correction factor for cap-turing distributions and asset payouts, f the invest-ment fund, and t the time of reporting.
The correction factor KF is calculated recursively as follows:KF f,t=RNP f,t1
RNP f,t1−(AK f,t+SUBK f,t)⇥KF f,t1
AK f,t=Af,t
ANZU f,t1,SUBK f,t=SUB f,t
ANZU f,t1,KF f,0=1,
where AK represents the distributions per unit share, 
A the total distributions, ANZU the total number of 
share units issued, SUBK the asset payouts per share unit, and SUB the total asset payouts.
The index of a particular class of investment fund is 
calculated as the average of the index values 
weighted by net asset values:
Index F ondskategorie t=⌃F ondsverm ¨ogen f,t⇥Index f,t
⌃F ondsverm ¨ogen f,t
This means that the index of a particular class of 
investment fund can change if the structure of the net asset values or the underlying indices vary.
1 Index numbers show the change compared with an 
initial or base value, which is set at 100.2 See Deutsche Börse AG, Guide to the Equity Indices of Deutsche Börse AG, version 8.2.1, May 2017, avail-
able on the Deutsche Börse AG website (www.dax- 
indices.com) under “Resources”.Deutsche Bundesbank

September 2017

funds also owned ships and aircraft worth €8 
billion.13
The investment funds statistics reporting also 
allows real estate data to be broken down by 
type of use. For example, a distinction can be 
made as to whether real estate is used mostly 
for office, residential or commercial purposes 
or for the sale and service of food. Ultimately, 
closed- end mutual funds mainly invested in of -
fice buildings, holding assets worth €12 billion. 
A further €5 billion was accounted for by build -
ings used for retail trade and food services, 
while €2 billion was invested in housing.
Significance of German 
 mutual fund sector across 
Europe
As at the end of the second quarter of 2017, 
euro area investment funds managed assets 
worth a total of €11,819 billion, with closed-  
end funds accounting for €367 billion. The re -
spective shares in the euro area aggregate of 
domestic open- end and closed-end mutual 
funds were 18% and 21%, meaning that Ger -
many makes up a significant proportion of the 
European investment fund sector.14Outlook
This is the first report in which performance in -
dices are published for selected retail investment 
funds (see the box on page 91 for calculation 
details ). These indices illustrate the performance 
of funds over time assuming that interim distri -
butions and other payments to investors are no -
tionally reinvested in the funds. This facilitates 
the comparison of performance between the dif -
ferent mutual funds. In the period from January 
2010 to July 2017, retail securities funds grew in 
value by a total of 54%, achieving an annual 
average return of 6%. Broken down by category, 
equity funds increased in value by 100% during 
this period, while bond funds appreciated by 
26% and mixed securities funds by 31%. In terms 
of returns, this corresponds to average annual 
rates of 10%, 3% and 4% respectively. These in -
dices are scheduled to be published regularly 
starting from the fourth quarter of 2017.15
Amongst other things, the aggregate data 
published on retail and specialised mutual 
funds are broken down by fund category ac -
cording to their reported investment focus. The 
categories include equity funds, bond funds, 
real estate funds, funds of funds, money mar -
ket funds and hedge funds. There are also 
plans to classify retail funds in future according 
to whether or not they comply with the 
UCITS Directive16. Undertakings are subject to
