Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 51 Economic conditions
1.1 Underlying trends: Economic recovery in Germany stalling
The economic recovery in Germany is stalling.  Real gross domestic product ( ) is GDP
likely to decline again slightly in the first quarter. The German economy continues to 
experience headwinds from various directions. Industry, in particular, is likely to remain 
sluggish. Orders for domestic industrial goods dropped further in Germany and 
abroad. Higher financing costs continue to dampen domestic demand, particularly in 
the area of investment. Heightened economic policy uncertainty is a further drag, 
especially with regard to the future direction of climate and transformation policy. 
Enterprises also perceive economic policy framework conditions, such as the growing 
burden of bureaucracy and regulation, as a barrier.  Private consumption is not 
expected to provide any major stimulus for now, either. Consumers are unsettled and 
reluctant to spend, even though their scope for spending is generally improving on the 
back of falling inflation rates and a steep rise in wages. At least the previously very high 
sickness rate is slowly easing and construction is likely to have been temporarily 
bolstered by the mild weather in February, although the sector is still navigating 
choppy waters. Overall, too, the still depressed survey indicators, such as business 
expectations as surveyed by the ifo Institute, also currently provide little evidence of an 
economic recovery for the second quarter.
1.2 Industry remains in a sluggish phase
Industry has not yet emerged from its sluggish phase and continues to struggle 
with a difficult competitive environment.  Industrial output was slightly up on the  1) 
 2) 1 According to surveys conducted by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( ), the surveyed DIHK
firms increasingly report that the economic policy framework is a business risk. Most recently, almost 60 % of 
them responded in this way. In its press release, the  reported that "growing bureaucracy, excessive DIHK
regulation, and the lack of economic policy impulses" are the areas where the firms taking part in the survey 
express most concern.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 6month in many sectors in January 2024 after seasonal adjustment.  Following a very 
weak December, higher output in the energy-intensive sectors is striking, as at the turn 
of 2022‑23. December could have been used more for holiday shutdowns or similar in 
these sectors. In spite of the month-on-month increase, industrial output contracted 
across all sectors in January compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Production of 
motor vehicles saw a particularly significant fall.  The short-term outlook is also rather 
gloomy, as weakness in demand persists. Following a sharp rise in the previous month, 
industrial new orders dropped substantially again in January, even disregarding volatile 
large orders.  A comparison with the previous quarter does not provide a brighter 
picture either. This was mainly due to foreign orders, but there were also fewer 
domestic orders. Particularly weak demand was observed for capital goods, with an 
especially sharp decline in demand from Germany and the euro area. In a long-term 
comparison, order backlogs in industry remain high and this is likely to have still 
cushioned the ongoing slowdown in demand somewhat. In January, nominal exports of 
goods increased significantly compared with December and with the fourth quarter of 
2023. However, given the persistent weakness in demand from abroad, the 
sustainability of this positive trend remains to be seen.

1.3 No stimulus from private consumption
Private consumption will probably increase only tentatively at most in the current 
quarter as well. Consumers remain unsettled. Price and seasonally adjusted sales 
declined in the retail sector in January and were below the level of the fourth quarter of 
2023. The decline was broadly based across segments. Averaged across January and 
February, motor vehicle registrations were also down on the previous quarter, 
according to data provided by the German Association of the Automotive Industry. The 
expiry of the environmental bonus for private electric vehicles led to anticipatory 
effects in December 2023 and a sharp decline in electric car registrations in January. 
Only the hotel and restaurant sector managed a slight increase in price and seasonally 
adjusted sales recently. According to surveys by the  Institute in February, the ifo
business climate in consumer-related services sectors continued to deteriorate. The 
assessment of the business situation in retail and, in particular, in the hotel and 
restaurant sector was once again lower in February. Although expectations for the next 
six months brightened somewhat in both sectors, they remained pessimistic. 
Consumer restraint is also confirmed by the  consumer climate index, which merely GfK
stabilised at a low level for March. Despite a rise in consumers’ income expectations, 
the propensity to purchase remained weak and the propensity to save was significantly 
higher.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 81.4 Labour market remains robust
The labour market remains robust in the spell of weak economic growth that has 
now persisted for some time . Seasonally adjusted employment increased by 54,000 
people in January, roughly twice as much as in the previous month. The initial estimate 
by the Federal Employment Agency – which is currently available for December 
2023 – shows that the number of employees subject to social security contributions 
went up by 19,000 on the previous month in seasonally adjusted terms. There was a 
marked increase in the number of jobs filled in business services and in the area of 
healthcare and long-term care. Furthermore, employment rose markedly in the public 
sector, energy and water supply and, once again, in the hotel and restaurant sector. By 
contrast, economic developments dampened employment in the areas of temporary 
agency work, manufacturing, trade and, to a small extent, in construction. In 
December, around 175,000 employees made use of short-time work for economic 
reasons, somewhat fewer than one month earlier. The employment outlook is stable 
overall, with most of the leading indicators of employment remaining in neutral 
territory in February. Only the  employment barometer for trade and industry ifo
continued its downward trend, in February falling to its lowest level since the first 
quarter of 2021.
Registered unemployment rose slightly in February. In seasonally adjusted terms, it 
rose again by 12,000 persons, after its previously marked increase had temporarily 
come to a halt in January. The number of people registered as unemployed increased 
to 2.7 million in February, leaving the unemployment rate at 5.9 % due to rounding. 
Compared with the previous year, the number of unemployed persons went up by just 
under 200,000, corresponding to an increase of 0.4 percentage point in the 
unemployment rate. Discounting the effects of the influx of refugees, the rise in 
unemployment among those covered by the cyclically influenced statutory 
unemployment insurance scheme was greater than among those receiving the basic 
welfare allowance. Furthermore, the nevertheless marked increase in recipients of the 
basic welfare allowance could indicate that more people are transitioning from 
receiving benefits under the statutory unemployment insurance scheme to the basic 
welfare allowance, as the period of economic weakness has now gone on for a good 18 
months. As in previous months, the outlook for the next few months has brightened 
slightly. The unemployment barometer of the Institute for Employment Research ( ) IAB
picked up somewhat in February, but remains in negative territory. Unemployment 
may therefore increase only slightly in the next three months.

1.5 Commodity prices recently mixed
Energy prices have recently developed unevenly.  While crude oil prices rose slightly, 
European gas prices saw another marginal drop. As this report went to press, a barrel 
of Brent crude oil cost $87, just over 9 % more than in January 2024. This is likely to US
have been due, among other things, to the decision of some  countries and their OPEC
partners to extend their production cutbacks. European gas prices fell by 5 % over the 
same period. The weather in Europe – which has been very favourable in the 
meantime – and the persistently stable supply of gas had a dampening effect on prices.
1.6 Inflation rate down a little further in February, core rate up
Price pressures at the upstream stages of the economy continued to decline at the 
beginning of the year, mainly owing to energy.  Import prices were down month on 
month in January, with energy prices, in particular, falling steeply. Producer prices, for 
which February data are already available, dropped moderately overall likewise due to Table 1.1b: Economic conditions in Germany, part 2

with the previous year, prices for imported goods and for domestic products were 
recently down by 8.5% and around 4.1%, respectively.  
The inflation rate is likely to fluctuate markedly in the second quarter.  The inflation 
rate may well trend down further in the coming months. While price pressures for food 
and non-energy industrial goods can be expected to decline markedly, a much slower 
disinflation process is anticipated in the services sector. This is due in part to current 
strong wage growth. However, owing to the calendar effects caused by this year's early 
Easter week, greater fluctuations in the inflation rate are expected compared with the 
previous year. Thus, the  for package holidays this year is expected to be HICP
significantly higher in March and significantly lower in April than it was last year.Consumer price growth was strong again in February.  Consumer prices rose in 
seasonally adjusted terms in February. Services prices were again raised at an above 
average rate. Prices for energy and non-energy industrial goods also saw marked 
increases, while unprocessed food prices fell sharply. The Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices ( HICP ) rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% on the month. 
Nevertheless, the rate of inflation measured in terms of the HICP  came down from 
3.1% to 2.7% relative to the previous year.  5)  This was mainly due to the year-on-year 
decline in costs for food, energy, and non-energy industrial goods. By contrast, services 
continued to show an above average inflation rate. Core inflation excluding energy and 
food held roughly steady at 3.5% (January: 3.4%).  
5 The annual rate of consumer inflation according to the national Consumer Price Index dropped from 2.9% to 
2.5%.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 112 Public finances
2.1 Statutory health insurance scheme
2.1.1 Sharp deterioration in annual result for 2023
The statutory health insurance ( SHI) scheme (comprising the health insurance 
institutions and the health fund) posted a deficit of €5 billion in 2023, according to 
preliminary figures.  The deficit was €2½ billion larger than had been expected based 
on the assumptions of the group of  estimators from the autumn of 2023.  This SHI
was mainly due to significantly higher spending on benefits by the health insurance 
institutions. The financial result of the  scheme deteriorated by €10 billion year on SHI
year.  This was largely because of lower special grants from central government. 
Instead of these, the health insurance institutions and the health fund were required to 
use reserves in 2023, which were in some cases sizeable, to finance deficits. The 
deterioration had thus been budgeted for.
At almost €3½ billion, the lion’s share of the deficit was attributable to the health 
fund  (2022: surplus of just over €4½ billion). At the end of 2023, the fund’s reserves 
amounted to €9½ billion (lower limit in 2023: €4½ billion).  The health insurance 
institutions closed the year with a deficit of €2 billion (previous year: surplus of €½ 
billion). Their reserves were thus down to €8½ billion at the end of the year (lower limit: 
€5 billion).
2.1.2 Significant reduction in revenue
The revenue of the SHI scheme was down by 3½% on the year. Contribution receipts 
saw substantial growth of just over 6%, though inflation compensation bonuses 
exempt from social contributions still had a dampening effect. Roughly 1 percentage  6)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 12point of this increase is due to the fact that supplementary contribution rates rose by 
just under 0.2 percentage point on average to 1.5 %. However, central government paid 
€28 billion less to the health fund overall:
Central government’s special funds to stabilise contributions declined by €12 
billion (to €2 billion; central government’s multi-year loan of €1 billion is not 
included).
Because pandemic-related payments have largely ceased, central government 
reduced the associated refunds by €20 billion to just under €1½ billion.
Meanwhile, central government paid additional funds to hospitals to ease the 
burden of higher energy costs (+€4 billion).

major pandemic-related payments had largely ceased. Instead, the fund was now 
passing on new funds to hospitals to help cover energy costs, but these payments were 
quantitatively much lower. By contrast, health insurance institutions’ expenditure rose 
significantly.
Health insurance institutions’ expenditure on benefits rose steeply (+5½%). This 
exceeded the expectations of the group of SHI estimators from the autumn of 2023 
by almost 1 percentage point  (additional expenditure of around €2 billion). In 
particular, spending on hospital treatment, a large expenditure item, rose steeply 
(+6½%). Payments for remedies and therapeutic appliances and for home nursing 
increased even more sharply (+9% and + 13%, respectively). Growth in outlays for 
medical treatment and pharmaceuticals, meanwhile, was below average (almost + 2% 
and + 3%, respectively). In the case of the latter, the measures introduced with effect 
from 2023 to curb spending appear to have had an impact here.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 142.1.4 Outlook for 2024 and beyond
From today’s perspective, the result for 2024 is likely to be perceptibly worse, 
however, especially among the health insurance institutions.  At the start of the year, 
the average supplementary contribution rate rose to the level determined by the 
Federal Ministry of Health as covering expenditure. However, developments this year 
are based on the significantly higher than estimated expenditure of the health 
insurance institutions from last year. If this is extrapolated as a base effect, instead of a 
balanced result the health insurance institutions will have a deficit of almost €2 billion. 
Coming in at €6 billion, the deficit for the  scheme would then be larger than in 2023.SHI
From 2025 onwards,  supplementary contribution rates are set to rise considerably 
unless this can be counteracted by the announced fundamental reform. Given the 
larger deficit in 2024, the available reserves would be used up. This alone will put 
significant upward pressure on the average supplementary contribution rate from 2025 
onwards. The announced reform plans for hospitals and  care would push it up GP
much further still. However, the Federal Ministry of Health has signalled a fundamental  
reform. It would be important for this reform to rein in the strong trend increase in 
expenditure.Based on the assumptions made by the group of SHI estimators in the autumn of 
2023, the SHI scheme is expected to post a deficit of €4 billion in 2024. This will be 
fully attributable to the health fund. The fund will transfer just over €2½ billion to the 
health insurance institutions from its reserves in order to limit the increase in 
supplementary contribution rates. Moreover, the health insurance institutions will 
receive €½ billion from these reserves for improvements in the areas of obstetrics and 
paediatrics. Finally, the health fund is likely to pay €1 billion from its liquidity reserve to 
the Innovation and Structural Funds.  9)  The health insurance institutions will post a 
broadly balanced result: expenditure should be up by 6 % on the estimated annual 
result for 2023, due in part to lagged inflationary effects on services charges. On this 
basis, the Federal Ministry of Health calculated a notional supplementary contribution 
rate of 1.7% to cover expenditure, which is 0.2 percentage point higher than previously.  
9 The group of  estimators does not take account of these transfers to the Innovation and Structural Funds in SHI

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 152.2 Public long-term care insurance scheme
2.2.1 Surplus in 2023
The public long-term care insurance scheme posted a surplus of almost €2 billion in 
2023.  In the previous year, it had still been running a deficit of €2 billion.  The 
strong year-on-year improvement in the result is due to three main factors:
 
 10)   11) 
At mid-year, the contribution rate rose by 0.35 percentage point to 3.4%.  12)  
Overall, this led to additional revenue of €3 billion.  
10 Preliminary figures. This refers to the core area, i.e. excluding the long-term care provident fund. In most 
years since 2015, this fund has received transfers from the core area. Up to 2022, these corresponded to 
receipts of 0.1 percentage point of the contribution rate applicable in that year. No transfers were made in 
2023, and these 2023 transfers will be made up in 2024. Regular transfers from 2024 will be cut significantly 
until 2027. Assets accumulated in this way are to be depleted in the 2030s to dampen the expected rise in the 
contribution rate. At the end of 2023, these accumulated reserves amounted to €11 billion.
11 Preliminary accounting figures for 2023 compared with the final annual outturn for 2022. By contrast, chart 
1.2 shows preliminary annual figures.
12 The general contribution rate applies to persons subject to contributions who have one child. Childless 
people pay a higher contribution, which rose more strongly to 4%. By contrast, the contribution rate for 
insurees with a particularly large number of children (five or more children under the age of 25) was lowered 
and now stands at 2.4%. For more on this and other elements of the legislative change, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2023b).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 16Coronavirus-related expenditure fell considerably, by just over €4 billion (to €½ 
billion), while special funds from central government for this purpose decreased 
less significantly (by €2½ billion). This eased pressure on the finances of the long-
term care insurance scheme to the tune of just over €1½ billion compared with 
2022.
The transfers to the long-term care provident fund in the amount of €1½ billion 
were not made (these will be made up in 2024).
At the end of the year, the long-term care insurance scheme repaid €½ billion to 
central government. It thus paid back half of a central government loan granted in 
2022.  Overall, liquid funds were up to €7 billion at the end of the year; due to the 
repayment, this growth was a little less strong than had been envisaged based on the 
surplus. Liquid funds equated to around 1.4 times the scheme’s average monthly 
expenditure (around €2 billion above the lower limit).
2.2.2 Strong growth in revenue
Contribution receipts increased very steeply, by 11½%. This was largely due to 
contribution rates being raised at mid-year.  After rough adjustment for this, 
contribution receipts still saw strong growth of 5 %. Social contribution-exempt ½
inflation compensation bonuses continued to dampen the increase in the contribution 
base. Special grants from central government from the previous year were largely 
absent, however (-€2½ billion). Total revenue thus went up by 5½%.
2.2.3 Total expenditure curbed by non-recurring effects
 The long-term care insurance scheme’s regular expenditure on benefits continued 
to rise sharply, climbing by 9½% and thus by much more than the contribution base.  
Of the regular expenditure on benefits, spending on inpatient care, a major item, saw 
continued strong growth (10%). Cash benefits also expanded steeply (9%), with benefit 
rates unchanged. Looking beyond regular expenditure on benefits, the fact that 
pandemic-related payments had largely ceased significantly eased financial pressures. 
In addition, the scheme deferred to this year transfers to the long-term care provident 
fund following the decision of central government (-€1½ billion). Overall, expenditure 
fell by 1½%.  
2.2.4 Outlook for 2024 and beyond
In 2024, the long-term care insurance scheme is likely to largely exhaust its surplus. 
The contribution base is likely to see substantial further growth, according to the 
Federal Government’s Annual Economic Report. On top of this, the contribution rates 
did not rise until the middle of last year. This means that additional revenue amounting 
to just over €3 billion year on year is expected once again. The core area reducing its 

Commentaries
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 17regular transfer to the long-term care provident fund and the annual central 
government grant of €1 billion at the same time being cancelled will have a neutralising 
effect in the scheme's finances. However, the long-term care insurance scheme will 
catch up on the €1½ billion payment to the provident fund that it had deferred last 
year. Moreover, core expenditure is likely to see continued robust growth. This is 
mainly because of the last long-term care reform, which expanded benefits overall.
The regular dynamic adjustment of benefits and, increasingly, demographic 
developments will put pressure on the long-term care insurance scheme’s finances 
in the years to come.  As a result, the contribution rate is likely to carry on being raised 
significantly in increments. However, the Federal Ministry of Health has announced a 
comprehensive reform for the spring. As in the case of the  scheme, it would make SHI
sense for the long-term care insurance scheme to rein in the strong trend increase in 
expenditure. At the very least, it needs to be possible to understand what costs for 
persons subject to contributions – costs in the form of higher contribution rates – are 
tied to benefit expansions. This would need to be disclosed transparently by means of 
longer-term projections.

19Developments in euro 
area business dynamism

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 20Measured in terms of firm entry and exit rates, business dynamism in the euro area has 
weakened markedly over the last twenty years. At the same time, aggregate 
productivity growth slowed down and allocation efficiency across firms declined. These 
three trends may be related: firm entries and exits play an important role in the 
allocation of scarce production factors to productive uses. If allocation efficiency 
declines as business dynamism slows, this can hamper productivity growth. Therefore, 
analysing business dynamism can help to explain the observed weak productivity 
growth.
Data issues complicate the analysis of business dynamism in the euro area. The time 
series on firm entries and exits in the official statistics contain gaps and structural 
breaks. This makes it difficult to examine longer periods of time, especially the period 
before 2008, and therefore to separate cyclical and structural developments. 
Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that business dynamism in the euro area was 
already weakening significantly before the onset of the global financial and economic 
crisis. This indicates that not only cyclical but also structural factors were at work. 
Analyses for the United States, where the availability of data on business dynamism is 
far better, can deliver valuable insights into potential drivers of business dynamism in 
the euro area.
Besides the general ups and downs of economic activity, one of the cyclical drivers of 
business dynamism is the level of uncertainty perceived by economic agents. The latter 
may have had a lasting dampening effect on firm entries in the wake of the global 
financial and economic crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis. A 
decline in business dynamism could also be observed in the context of the severe 
economic turmoil witnessed during the − 19 pandemic. One structural factor is COVID
population ageing in the euro area. Regulatory and institutional barriers are also likely 
to weigh on business dynamism. Insufficient competition represents another possible 
factor.
A better institutional and regulatory framework could stimulate business dynamism 
and thereby strengthen productivity growth. Reforms at the European level could play 
a role here. For key policy areas, however, ownership and responsibility lie at the 
national level.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 211 Business dynamism and labour productivity
One possible explanation for the slowdown in TFP growth is a decline in allocation 
efficiency.  Data analyses for the euro area show that differences in  levels across TFP
firms within the same economic sector tended to increase on average from 2003 up to 
the outbreak of the − 19 pandemic.  The spread between the firms’ efficiency COVID
levels has therefore widened over time. This suggests a decline in allocation efficiency 
at the firm level, i.e. a less efficient distribution of production factors across firms.  An 
efficient reallocation of production factors from low-productivity firms to highly 
productive ones is a key driver of aggregate  growth, however.TFPLabour productivity growth has been slowing for some time in many advanced 
economies.  1)  One reason for this is the declining growth in total factor productivity  
(TFP), which is one of the key drivers of labour productivity. TFP growth describes the 
part of output growth that cannot be explained by changes in the use of production 
factors such as labour and capital, making it a measure of economic efficiency gains. 
Growth in TFP declined markedly in many advanced economies, including the euro area.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 22The reallocation of resources across firms is closely linked to business dynamism.  
As start-ups enter the market, they strengthen competition and increase the pressure 
on their competitors to innovate. Less profitable firms succumb to this pressure and 
exit the market (creative destruction).  This frees up resources for more productive 
firms. Firm entries and exits therefore hold great significance for aggregate 
productivity growth.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 232 Declining business dynamism in the euro area
The analysis of business dynamism in the euro area is hindered by a difficult data 
situation. The business demography statistics reported by  do not extend back Eurostat
beyond 1997, with data availability varying widely between countries.  Furthermore, 
changes in data collection methods make longer-term comparisons more difficult. In 
2008, a comprehensively revised Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the 
European Community ( ) was introduced, which also had an impact on business NACE
statistics.  In addition, countries individually adjusted their data collection methods 
over time. These structural breaks had considerable effects in some cases. One 
example is the time series for Germany which, owing to methodological changes, 
shows significantly higher business dynamism from 2018 onwards. This suggests that 
alternative data sources should be used in addition. For an analysis of longer-term 
developments in business dynamism in Germany on the basis of alternative data 
sources, see the section on the decline in dynamism in the German corporate sector 
over the past two decades. 8)  9)

 11) 
8 Business demography statistics are mainly sourced from national business registers, which are primarily 
based on administrative and statistical sources. Administrative sources generally comprise i) tax registers; ii) 
obligatory registers, e.g. for limited liability companies or companies listed on stock exchanges; iii) social 
security statistics; and iv) other public or private data collections. Statistical sources generally include 
responses from various surveys. For more information, see Overview – Business demography –   (europa. Eurostat
eu) and  (2007). Eurostat

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 24Supplementary information
Dynamism in the German corporate sector down 
overall in last two decades
A raft of data sources can be examined to take stock of business dynamism in 
Germany’s corporate sector.  Business dynamism is determined in large part by firm 
entries and exits. Their significance for allocation efficiency and productivity growth is  
outlined in . This section details an examination of long-term firm entry and Chapter 1
exit patterns in Germany using data from the Federal Statistical Office’s business 
registration statistics, which are available over an extended horizon without structural 
breaks.  Complementary data on firm exits are taken from the Federal Statistical 
Office’s insolvency statistics. Another important measure of reallocation dynamics in 
the corporate sector is the reallocation of jobs and workers between firms. For 
example, productivity growth will be enhanced if more-productive incumbent firms 
create more employment.  New Federal Employment Agency data deliver valuable 
insights into worker flows between firms. Furthermore, an analysis of Bundesbank 
corporate data for the manufacturing sector reveals evidence of the dynamism 
produced by incumbent firms’ employment decisions.
The last two decades saw a drop in firm exit numbers in Germany.  This applies both  
to business insolvencies, which fell by 55% between 2004 and 2023, and to business  1)  2) 
 3) 
 4) 1 The examination covers start-ups and complete closures of head offices for businesses with greater economic 
significance. These encompass businesses managed or established by a legal person, a partnership or a 
natural person. In the case of natural persons, this is predicated on them being (or having been) entered in 
the commercial register, having (had) an entry in a skilled trades register, or employing (or having employed) 
at least one person.
2 Owing to structural breaks, long-term time series on start-ups and closures of firms in Germany based on 
business demography statistics are not currently available, which is why information from business 
registration statistics is used here. Business registration statistics differ from business demography statistics 
in two important respects. First, results are presented at the legal entity level in business registration statistics, 
but at the enterprise level in business demography statistics. Second, unlike with the business demography 
statistics, a business recognition or derecognition in the business registration statistics does not necessarily 
represent an actual start-up or closure because firm takeovers or transformations and the like are also 
registered. To get as close as possible to business demography data, the focus here is on start-ups and 
complete closures of corporate head offices. Another difference is that only businesses with greater economic 
significance are considered here, whereas the business demography statistics include, for example, small 
enterprises.
3 Furthermore, employment reallocation between firms can enhance productivity if it results in an employee’s 
expertise and skillset being better suited to the profile of the new job than was the case in their previous job.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 25The last two years have seen a renewed uptick in the number of business 
insolvencies and business closures. One notable reason for this – alongside the weak 
state of the economy overall – will probably have been firm exit numbers catching up 
with pre-pandemic levels. Judging by recent developments, there is no sign as yet that 
this trend will go into reverse.
 Annual firm entry numbers have likewise shrunk over the past two decades.  
Between 2004 and 2014, the number of annual business recognitions of corporate 
head offices fell by 30% to around 86,000. They have been fairly stable at a relatively 
low level for the last ten years or so. Firm entry numbers spiked sharply higher as the 
closures, which fell by 30% over the same period.  4)  The COVID − 19 pandemic era saw  
the downward trend gain pace in spite of the severe economic downturn. This was due 
to the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency, alongside 
comprehensive government support programmes.  5)  
4 In 2022, there were 61,355 business derecognitions of corporate head offices and 14,590 business 
insolvencies. The vast majority of firm exits, then, did not involve insolvency proceedings. Businesses might 
also exit the market on account of factors such as worsening earnings prospects.
5 For further information on how business insolvencies evolved during the − 19 pandemic, see also COVID
Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b).

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 26wider economy recovered in 2021, but this upturn did not turn out to be sustainable. 
The most recent figures for firm entries – around 87,000 in 2023 – are broadly consistent 
with the annual averages observed since 2014.
New Federal Employment Agency data on worker mobility between firms suggest 
that the scale of reallocation has been comparatively stable in recent years.  Monthly 
time series dating back to January 2013 show how the number of new jobs subject to 
social security contributions has evolved,  allowing a job-to-job transition rate (worker 
flow rate) to be calculated. This rate indicates the percentage of workers who move 
from one plant to another in a given month.  The job-to-job transition rate has 
increased strongly since 2013 and especially so in the years 2017 and 2018. The rate 
began to decline at the turn of 2018‑19. It fell significantly at the onset of the − 19 COVID
pandemic. By 2022, however, this had been more than offset relatively quickly as the 
pent-up need for reallocation that had built up during the acute phase of the pandemic 
was released. Since then, the rate has been back on the decline (see Chart 2.3). The fact 
that the rate is persisting well above its 2016 level in spite of the weak state of the real 
economy probably owes something to the growing labour shortages. Due to the 
shrinking pool of unemployed people, employers were increasingly poaching workers 
from each other. 6) 
 7) 
6 A distinction is made here between persons who previously held jobs subject to social security contributions, 
were otherwise employed, seeking work or were not on file with the Federal Employment Agency (e.g. career 
starters with no vocational training or immigrants entering the labour market, non-employed persons 
rejoining the labour market, or self-employed persons/civil servants switching to jobs subject to social security 
contributions).
7 This rate is calculated as the ratio of newly employed persons in jobs subject to social security contributions 
who previously also held jobs subject to social security contributions with a break of no more than one month 
divided by the total number of jobs subject to social security contributions.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 27The growing labour shortages had an impact on long-term transition rates out of 
and into unemployment as well.  In addition to the job-to-job channel, these rates also 
have a role to play in the corporate sector reallocation process as new workers can also 
be sourced from the pool of unemployed workers. On the one hand, transitions out of 
employment into unemployment relative to the number of employees (the job 
separation rate) have long been charting a trend decline.  This will probably have 
been due in part to the labour market reforms of the early years of this millennium, 
alongside demographic factors.  These reforms are also likely to have provided a key 
impetus for the relatively swift uptick in transitions out of unemployment into 
employment (relative to the number of unemployed persons – the job finding rate) in 
the second half of the first decade of this millennium.  However, this rate has 
declined significantly of late in the wake of the outbreak of the − 19 pandemic COVID

Deutsche Bundesbank (2014) as well as the references cited therein. Hence, the pent-up demand for new hires 
triggered by the reforms was so great that the job finding rate in 2009, when the global financial and 
economic crisis was at its peak, remained at a higher than average level despite declining slightly.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 28and the beginning of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Overall, these 
developments reflect the trend decline in the unemployment rate in Germany between 
2005 and 2019.
The intensity of employment reallocation between manufacturing firms saw only 
marginal change in Germany between 2006 and 2021.  If productive companies 
expand and create jobs, while less efficient companies reduce employment, this has a 
positive effect on productivity growth.  The reallocation of employment between 
incumbent firms is analysed here using Bundesbank data for the manufacturing sector.
 The aggregate gross reallocation rate is computed from firms’ job creation and 
destruction rates.  That rate broadly declined between 2006 and 2014, before 
recovering and then continuing to rise slightly during the − 19 pandemic. It has COVID
been hovering marginally above its long-term average of late. The rate’s recovery since 
2014 is consistent with the rise in the job-to-job transition rate and the job finding rate 
during this period. The slight increase observed in 2020 is due to very strong job 
destruction. Job creation, by contrast, declined sharply, mirroring the slump in job-to-
job transitions.
All told, dynamism in the German corporate sector has been receding over the past 
two decades, meaning that it might have been a factor in subdued productivity 
growth. There was a sharp drop in firm entry and exit numbers in particular. Indicators 
for the reallocation of workers and employment between firms, by contrast, have 
remained fairly stable on average over time. This is in line with the mounting tensions 
in the German labour market over the past ten years, which may have offset the 
general decline in employment reallocation observed previously. The finding that 
business dynamism has declined overall in Germany is consistent with developments in 
the euro area as a whole. 11)

11 For more on the productivity effects of employment reallocation during the − 19 pandemic, see COVID
Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a).
12 The  dataset contains annual financial statements of German non-financial corporations which are sent JANIS
to the Bundesbank for credit assessment purposes, as well as financial statements from public sources; see 
Becker et al. (2022). This is a non-representative sample of firms in which larger firms feature more strongly. 
Coverage of individual sectors varies considerably. In addition, information on the number of employees is not 
necessarily part of the annual financial statements and is therefore sometimes missing. In the manufacturing 
sector, the information needed for analysis exists for a fairly large number of firms, meaning that the focus 
here is on these particular firms. The data cover around 45% of workers in the manufacturing sector.  
13 The calculation follows Davis and Haltiwanger (1992), with firm entries and exits being disregarded due to 
gaps in the data.
14 This is consistent with the relatively high level of job destruction in the manufacturing sector during the 
− 19 pandemic. As was the case during the financial crisis, the job destruction rate increased very sharply in COVID
2020 while the job creation rate declined sharply. This left the gross reallocation rate up slightly overall in 
2020. An analysis based on Belgian corporate data – which had a broader basis including other sectors – 
produced similar results for 2020; see Konings et al. (2023).

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 29In order to obtain information on developments in euro area business dynamism 
despite the difficult data situation, a panel approach is used.  This way, challenges 
arising from the difficult data situation in individual countries can be mitigated. 
Incorporating cross-sectional information – in particular, country-specific sectoral 
information on firm entry and exit rates – allows us to compare business dynamism 
over time even if, in some countries, the time series dimension is limited, data gaps 
exist, and there are shifts in levels due to methodological changes. In this kind of panel 
approach, country-specific sectoral firm entry and exit rates are regressed on a 
constant and on indicator variables for countries, years, sectors and structural breaks.
 The average path of annual entry and exit rates across the countries and sectors 
included in the model can be derived from the estimated coefficients of the time 
indicators.
The path of entry and exit rates – summarised in the churn rate – provides clear 
evidence that business dynamism in the euro area has receded over time.  The 
churn rate is calculated as the sum of firm entry rates and exit rates. Since a major 
revision of the statistical classification of economic activities was introduced in 2008, we 
examine two sub-periods.  Between 1998 and 2007, business dynamism as measured 
by the churn rate declined, mainly on account of a diminishing entry rate. This was 
particularly evident between 1998 and 2003. Business dynamism then recovered 
somewhat, but the entry rate never returned to the 1998 level. The exit rate fluctuated 
for some time but did not show a clear trend. When interpreting the results, it should 
be noted that the dataset for this period is small, varies considerably between countries 
and lacks information on structural breaks.  Results for the period from 2008 
onwards are much more reliable. Since then, business dynamism has seen a relatively 
steady decline. In the wake of the − 19 pandemic, the firm entry rate, especially, COVID
has decreased of late. 12)  13)

12 The entry rate (exit rate) is defined as the ratio of the number of business start-ups (business closures) to the 
total number of active firms in the respective year. The analysis only considers firms with at least one 
employee so as to ensure better comparability across countries. Sole proprietorships (including those 
established with the help of one-person business start-up grants known as “Ich- ”, which were widespread in AGs
Germany for a time) are therefore excluded. See  (2007). Eurostat

It is particularly noteworthy that firm entry rates did not recover during the 
favourable economic period between 2013 and 2019.  During that spell, euro area GDP 
rose by an average of 1.6% per year, and the unemployment rate fell from 12.0% to 
7.5%. Against this background, one might have expected to see rising entry rates. Such 
a cyclical pattern can at least be documented for the United States: here, business 
start- ups tend to be procyclical, business closures countercyclical (see the section on 
the cyclical development of business dynamism in the United States).  17)

The cyclical development of business dynamism in the 
United States
Firm entries and exits are an important characteristic of business cycles.  Economic 
booms or busts can have a substantial impact on the decision to set up or close down 
businesses. Firm entries and exits, in turn, affect employment and productivity, and 
thus the business cycle itself.
For the United States, long time series can be used to analyse how the trend and 
cyclical components of business dynamism have developed over recent decades.  
Detailed data from Business Dynamics Statistics ( ) allow an analysis of firm entry BDS
and exit rates over the period from 1979 to 2020.  To study the cyclical behaviour, the 
time series of the entry and exit rates are decomposed into a trend and a cyclical 
component.  According to its trend, business dynamism in the United States, too, has 
declined significantly in recent decades (see Chart 2.5). 1) 
 2) 
1 Data on firm entries and exits are compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau annually in mid-March and 
consequently reflect developments between mid-March of the preceding year and mid-March of the current 
year. Owing to this annual structure, the data for 2020 capture the impact of the − 19 pandemic only to a COVID
limited extent.
2 The firm entry rate is the ratio of enterprises with an age of zero in the respective year to the total number of 
enterprises in the previous year. The firm exit rate is the ratio of firm exits in a given year to the total number 
of enterprises in the previous year; see U.S. Census Bureau (2021). A Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing 
parameter of 6.25 is used for detrending; see Ravn and Uhlig (2002).

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 32The cyclical component of the firm entry rate in the United States shows a high 
degree of co-movement with economic activity.  The relationship between business 
dynamism and the business cycle is examined by analysing the correlation between 
firm entry and exit rates, on the one hand, and the real  growth rate, on the other. GDP
 Here, a statistically significant, strongly positive correlation between the firm entry 
rate and  growth emerges. Hence, in economic upturns, more firms are created GDP
(see Table 2.1).

3 To avoid distorting the estimation of the correlation between firm entry and exit rates and  growth, annual GDP
data on real  are derived from quarterly observations, matching the latter to the reporting period of the  GDP BDS
data. Hence, the contemporaneous level of annual  that is used to calculate the  growth rate captures the GDP GDP
aggregate economic activity from the second quarter of the previous year to the first quarter of the year in 
question. For more information, see Tian (2018).

By contrast, the firm exit rate is countercyclical. The firm exit rate is negatively 
correlated with  growth. However, the statistical relationship is less pronounced GDP
than it is for the firm entry rate. Nevertheless, the results suggest that firms 
increasingly exit the market during economic downturns.
Small firms drive the cyclicality of firm entry and exit rates. Firms are usually small 
when they are created and when they leave the market. An analysis of the interaction 
between the business cycle and business dynamism for different size classes 
demonstrates this fact (see Table 2.1). The co-movement of the firm entry rate and  GDP
growth is strongest for firms with one to nine employees. For enterprises with more 
than 100 employees, by contrast, there is no statistically significant correlation between 
the firm entry rate and the business cycle. The firm exit rate is countercyclical in 
statistically significant terms only for small enterprises with up to four employees. For 
larger enterprises, no such statistical relationship can be identified.Table 2.1: Correlation between real GDP  growth and firm entry and exit rates for selected firm sizes

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 34The relationship between business dynamism and GDP  growth has weakened over 
time. Since around 2011, the cyclical component of firm entry rates has shown 
remarkably little variation. The same applies to the cyclical variation in the firm exit 
rate, which only picked up again markedly in 2020.
A structural break test suggests that the relationship between firm entry rates and 
macroeconomic activity dissipated after the global financial and economic crisis 
subsided. The statistical test provides information on whether the strength of the 
correlation has changed significantly at an unspecified point in time.  Hence, the test 
does not prescribe any specific break date, but identifies the year with the highest 
probability of a possible break in a predefined time interval.  For the correlation 
between firm entry rate and  growth, the test identifies a significant structural GDP
break in 2011.  From then on, there is no longer a significant relationship between the 
firm entry rate and the economic situation (see Table 2.2). The contemporaneous 
correlation even changes its sign.

evidence is weaker than for firm entry rates, though. While there are indications of a 
structural break in 2010, the test statistic is not significant.  From this date onwards, 
however, there is also no significant correlation with the business cycle anymore. If, on 
the other hand, one examines the behaviour of the exit rate in the period prior to the

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 36Restricted economic activity during the COVID − 19 pandemic was accompanied by 
significantly reduced business dynamism.  The entry rate declined markedly in 2020. 
However, the exit rate fell slightly as well. This might be connected to the particular 
nature of the pandemic-induced economic crisis, but it was probably mainly the result 
of the economic policy response, the aim of which was to keep businesses afloat and 
preserve jobs.
The slowdown in business dynamism was broad across regions.  With the 
exception of Belgium, the churn rate decreased between 2008 and 2020 in all countries 
under review. The decline was relatively substantial in France and Spain.  In Germany 
and the Netherlands, the rate fell markedly, too.  In both countries, diminishing firm 
entry rates were primarily responsible for the slowdown in business dynamism. In 
Spain, meanwhile, the declining firm exit rate was mainly to blame. The same was true 
of the period 2008 to 2012 in France, where the subsequent decline in the churn rate 
between 2013 and 2020 can, for the most part, be explained by the pandemic-related 
reduction in the firm entry rate. By comparison, firm entry and exit rates in Italy and 
Belgium showed less variation, even if the − 19 pandemic dampened business COVID
dynamism here as well. In Belgium, the churn rate showed no clear trend, whilst in 
Italy, business dynamism only began to slow markedly in 2015. 18)

Germany due to the methodological problems mentioned above. That said, alternative indicators do suggest 
that business dynamism, too, remained listless there in the years after 2017 and did not diverge significantly 
from developments in the other large euro area countries (see also the section on declining dynamism in the 
). German corporate sector over the last two decades
19 Here again, caution is warranted when interpreting the results owing to the methodological changes, 
particularly those relating to the revision of the statistical classification of economic activities (changeover 
from  Rev. 1.1 to  Rev. 2). The structural breaks reported by  denote significant methodological NACE NACE Eurostat
changes. These are particularly striking in Germany in 2018 and in France in 2013, leading to significant shifts 
in the time series in some instances.
20 In France, there was a structural break in 2013 owing to methodological changes. This caused the firm entry 
rate to rise significantly, by around 2 percentage points, between 2012 and 2013. There were no such 
anomalies in the firm exit rate. The churn rate, however, fell markedly between 2008 and 2012 and again 
between 2013 and 2020.
21 Owing to the methodological problems mentioned above, developments for Germany are described only up 
to and including 2017.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 37In sectoral terms, too, the picture is fairly uniform, with firm entry and exit rates 
decreasing over time in all the economic activities under consideration.  With 
regard to the firm entry rate, this was, not least, due to the very significant decline in 
some cases observed in the first year of the − 19 pandemic – a development that COVID
was especially evident in accommodation and food service activities, for example. 
However, even before the outbreak of the pandemic, there were already some quite 
pronounced declines in entry rates in, for instance, the finance and insurance sector, 
real estate and some services sectors. In manufacturing, by contrast, the change in the 
entry rate was much less pronounced. Meanwhile, the exit rates saw major 
movements, particularly in the years following the onset of the global financial and 
economic crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis. In construction 
and the real estate sector the firm exit rate fell markedly during this period, after these 
industries had experienced in some cases significant turmoil in several countries 
(including Spain).  In the area of administrative and support service activities and 
professional, scientific and technical activities the exit rates also declined markedly.

environment and the subsequent upswing in the real estate market, which benefited from it.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 38than exit rates. In addition, entry and exit rates in services were significantly higher 
than in manufacturing, and also fluctuated more. One likely explanation for this is the 
higher share of small firms in the services sector relative to manufacturing. Studies 
show that, in aggregate terms, business dynamism is, to a large extent, driven by the 
market entry and exit of small firms.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 403 Possible reasons for the slowdown in business 
dynamism
The decline in business dynamism can have cyclical and structural reasons.  Business 
dynamism depends on various factors. Besides cyclical influences, these include 
structural obstacles like, for example, excessive bureaucracy, a lack of institutional 
quality and demographic change. All of these may be reasons, amongst others, for 
rigidities in product and factor markets. Distinguishing between cyclical and structural 
influences is very challenging in some cases. Longer-term trends in firm entry and exit 
rates can be an indication that structural factors are at work. However, based on 
 data, robust results can only derived as of 2008 for the reasons mentioned Eurostat
above. Not least due to the occurrence of the global financial and economic crisis and 
the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis, which fell into this period, it is difficult 
to identify purely structural factors for the slowdown of business dynamism.
OECD  indicators, which are available over a longer period, provide evidence that 
cyclical factors are not the sole drivers of the weakening in euro area business 
dynamism. An analysis for eight euro area countries shows that, in particular, the 
average firm entry rate was declining even before the global financial and economic 
crisis.  Alongside cyclical factors, structural factors are therefore probably also 
responsible for the decline in business dynamism in the euro area. The fact that 
business dynamism likewise experienced a trend decline in a number of large 
advanced economies outside the euro area – including the United States – is also 
consistent with this picture (see also the section on the cyclical development of 
). business dynamism in the United States 25)

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 41The significance of cyclical and structural factors can be investigated more closely 
using quantitative methods. The difficult data situation in the euro area is one reason 
why cause-effect analyses for the United States are used here as a reference point. 
Although the results for the United States cannot be directly applied to the euro area, 
they still provide valuable evidence of possible drivers in the euro area.
3.1 Cyclical factors
Severe macroeconomic turmoil constitutes one possible explanation for the 
lacklustre business dynamism in the euro area.  Fluctuations in firm entries and exits 
are a key feature of business cycles. In cyclical upturns, more firms are typically 
established, while firms tend to be closed more frequently during downturns. Analyses 
for the United States show that the cyclical pattern of firm entry rates is significantly 
more pronounced than that of firm exit rates (see also the section on the cyclical 
). Sharp economic development of business dynamism in the United States


Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 42downturns – as in the course of the global financial and economic crisis – can 
significantly depress the rate at which firms enter the market and thus weaken 
business dynamism overall.
A crisis-induced rise in uncertainty can dampen the firm entry rate on a lasting 
basis. Uncertainty can affect the entry rate through various channels. Altered 
investment behaviour plays an important role in this regard.  Investment – such as 
establishing a firm – often entails considerable sunk costs. As a consequence, it is 
possible that plans to set up a firm might rather be postponed when uncertainty is 
elevated in order to allow the decision to be taken later, when better information is 
available.  Financial market responses to uncertainty – such as rising risk premia and 
limited lending – can also stand in the way of business start-ups.
Estimates for the United States show a sustained decline in firm entries following an 
unexpected rise in uncertainty.  In order to assess in more detail the potential impact 
of uncertainty on the firm entry rate, a structural vector autoregressive ( ) model is SVAR
estimated.  In addition to a number of macroeconomic variables, the model includes 
an indicator of financial market uncertainty  as well as data on firm entries.  The 
impulse-response function derived from the model shows that after an unexpected 
increase in financial market uncertainty, firm entries decrease significantly and for a 
noticeably long period. 26)

Uncertainty shocks are assumed to have a direct impact on the other variables. The endogenous variables 
enter the model with a maximum lag of four periods. The model equations also contain a constant as 
deterministic components. See also Kilian and Lütkepohl (2017).
31 The indicator of financial market uncertainty is based on the volatility of estimation errors resulting from the

forecast errors determines the degree of uncertainty. For a detailed description of the methodology, see

data from the Survey of Current Business produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (1996) for the period 
from 1960 to 1993 with data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the years 1994 to 2023; see also 
Brand et al. (2019) and Cieślik and Turgut (2023).

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 43Heightened uncertainty in the euro area is also a possible explanation for weak firm 
entry rates in the post-crisis period.  Indicators for the euro area show that financial 
market uncertainty was exceptionally high on numerous occasions during the global 
financial and economic crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis. 
Looking at the estimation results for the United States, this provides a potential 
explanation for the strikingly weak developments in the euro area firm entry rate, 
which extend well beyond the crisis period.


Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 44Policy responses to macroeconomic developments can likewise have an impact on 
business dynamism.  These include, first, fiscal policy support for the economy. 
Analyses based on a structural macroeconomic model show, for example, that the 
German government's programme to stabilise the economy during the − 19 COVID
pandemic reduced the probability of firms exiting the market, in some cases 
significantly beyond the immediate crisis phase.  Second, monetary policy can 
likewise have an impact on developments in firm entries and exits, for example by 
contributing to economic stabilisation. The consequences for business dynamism 
thereby also depend on the design of monetary policy. There are, for instance, 
indications that the extended measures taken in response to the global financial and 
economic crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis helped unprofitable firms to 
remain in the market and thus contributed to the strikingly weak euro area business 
dynamism in the economic upturn that followed (see also the section on the possible 
side effects of a prolonged expansionary monetary policy stance on business

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 45Supplementary information
On the possible side effects of a prolonged 
expansionary monetary policy stance on business 
dynamism in the euro area
In response to the global financial and economic crisis and the subsequent 
European sovereign debt crisis, key interest rates in the euro area were kept at low, 
sometimes negative, levels for a long period.  In addition, there were non-standard 
monetary policy measures, such as the asset purchase programme and 
announcements that key interest rates would not be raised in the foreseeable future 
(forward guidance).  This helped to cushion the decline in economic output and to 
stabilise the inflation rate in line with the monetary policy mandate.
Economic research has focused intensively on the macroeconomic effects of a 
prolonged expansionary monetary policy stance, including potentially undesirable 
side effects.  One concern is that a persistent expansionary monetary policy stance 
could hamper business dynamism, leading to a productivity-dampening misallocation 
of production resources. There are a number of plausible transmission channels. On 
the one hand, the funding costs for firms, including less productive ones, decrease in a 
low interest rate environment. This can prevent firms from exiting the market.  As a 
result, profit margins would decrease due to increased competition for sales markets 
and production factors, hindering the market entry of potential candidates.  A 
prolonged expansionary monetary policy stance can also render credit institutions less 
profitable. 1)

5 A core business area of banks is to transform short-term liabilities, such as savings deposits, into longer-term 
assets such as mortgages, asset-backed securities and business loans. If interest rates on medium-term and 
long-term loans are lowered by monetary policy measures, the spread over short-term interest rates narrows 
and the profitability of this business model decreases. See, inter alia, Borio et al. (2017) and Claessens et al. 
(2018).

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 46In order to avoid writing off claims, realising losses or setting aside provisions, banks 
may be tempted to provide additional funds to uncompetitive firms.
Various empirical studies suggest that the prolonged expansionary monetary policy 
stance in the euro area may have weighed on business dynamism.  Microdata for 12 
 countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, suggest that the share of EU
unprofitable firms with access to favourable financing conditions increased due to the 
monetary policy stance following the global financial and economic crisis.  Moreover, 
according to panel estimates, this was associated with lower firm entry and exit rates.  
This finding could explain why, despite the broad-based cyclical upturn, business 
dynamism in the euro area remained weak during the low interest rate period (see also 
the fourth paragraph of chapter 2).
Bundesbank simulations suggest that the degree of monetary policy 
accommodation may have influenced business dynamism in the subsequent 
normalisation phase as well.  The analysis is based on a stylised New Keynesian 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium ( ) model with endogenous firm entry and DSGE
exit.  Households can invest their income not only in bonds and physical capital, but 
can also use it to promote business start-ups. Monetary policy is represented by a 
Taylor rule, with the short-term nominal interest rate being constrained by a zero lower 
bound. To outline the impact of interest rates that are low for longer, it is assumed that 
the model economy is hit by a strong demand shock.  Two scenarios, which differ in 
terms of their degree of monetary policy accommodation, are then compared. In both 
scenarios, the demand shock causes a significant decline in consumption and 
investment at first. Due to weaker demand, firms reduce their production and lower 
their prices, resulting in a rise in firm exits. Monetary policymakers lower the interest 
rate until it reaches the zero lower bound. The two scenarios differ in terms of how 
long the short-term interest rate is held at the zero lower bound. 6)

France and Spain) and of Schmidt et al. (2023) for Spain.
9 In addition to a representative household, the model also covers goods-producing firms as well as a central 
bank. The monetary policy rule is modelled in line with Gust et al. (2017) and Gutiérrez et al. (2021), inter alia. 
The modelling of firm entries and exits follows the approach taken by Jaimovich and Floetotto (2008) and 
Cavallari (2015). The  model contains typical New Keynesian elements such as wage and price rigidities and DSGE
investment adjustment costs.
10 This is modelled as an unexpected abrupt increase in the risk premium, i.e. the spread between the risk-free 
interest rate and the return on risky assets. This approach is consistent with numerous model-based analyses 
of the impact of the global financial and economic crisis in 2008. See, inter alia, Gust et al. (2017).

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 47 
According to model simulations, a more expansionary monetary policy stance can 
stabilise the overall economy faster, but it dampens business dynamism during the 
subsequent normalisation. The simulation results show that the economy as a whole 
recovers more quickly in the scenario with a more expansionary monetary policy 
stance. The firm entry rate likewise reaches its pre-crisis level sooner. The firm exit rate 
even falls below that level for a time. However, a more accommodative monetary policy 
stance also entails lower entry and exit rates in the subsequent monetary policy 
normalisation phase, during which the real interest rate rises. Consequently, returns on 
capital and business investment must likewise increase in order for households to 
invest in these assets.  To this end, in addition to the physical capital stock, the 
number of firms in the market, which had previously been increased by the more 
expansionary monetary policy stance, must also decrease. The higher the previous 
degree of monetary policy expansion, the more the firm entry rate in particular 
 11) 
11 It is assumed that the model excludes arbitrage opportunities between different investment options.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 48decreases during monetary policy normalisation. This, in turn, contributes to weaker 
overall business dynamism. 12) 
12 The firm exit rate is also somewhat lower under the more expansionary monetary policy stance. Monetary 
policy had previously significantly increased firm values. In the more accommodative monetary policy 
scenario, firm profits were significantly higher during the macroeconomic recovery period. As firm values 
decline only slowly during the normalisation phase, the probability of a firm exit is temporarily lower, in line 
with the assumptions made.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 493.2 Structural factors
Demographic change is another possible cause of the decline in business dynamism
. This could conceivably take place through various channels. As a population ages, 
labour supply tends to decline.  Moreover, innovation and the willingness to take 
risks could diminish as people get older.  Yet these factors play a key role in setting 
up businesses. In addition, declining labour force growth and increasing life expectancy 
could stimulate saving. This tends to depress the real interest rate, which makes it 
easier for incumbent firms to refinance fixed assets. This may lead to fewer firms 
closing. The result can be a competitive disadvantage for potential market entry 
candidates, which is reflected in a lower firm entry rate in the long term.
Empirical evidence for the United States shows that population ageing has a 
significant impact on business dynamism. The analyses are based on a vector 
autoregressive model that was estimated for a panel of 50  states over the period US
from 1980 to 2018.  The results show that the old-age dependency ratio had a 
marked negative impact on  business dynamism. According to the U.S. Census US
Bureau's population projections, demographic pressures are expected to increase in 
the coming years. Model simulations illustrate that population ageing is likely to 
significantly slow down  business dynamism in the future as well.US 34)

37 The endogenous model variables include macroeconomic variables such as the growth rate of per capita GDP
, the unemployment rate and the (short-term) real interest rate as well as information on annual firm entry and 
exit rates. The old-age dependency ratio and the young-age dependency ratio are included as exogenous 
variables. The former measures the ratio of the population over the age of 64 to the working-age population 
(15 to 64 year olds). The latter reflects the ratio of the under-15s to the working-age population. The 
endogenous variables are included in the model with a delay of one period. Time and state-specific fixed 
effects are taken into account in the estimation.
38 The procedure follows the approach used by Aksoy et al. (2019).

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 50The results for the United States suggest that population ageing is also dampening 
business dynamism in the euro area.  In the four largest euro area countries, the old-
age dependency ratio is, in some instances, even significantly higher than in the United 
States, mainly because the population has a higher life expectancy.  In addition, the 
old-age dependency ratio has risen significantly earlier and more strongly in recent 
decades. Thus, it seems likely that demographic change has contributed to an even 
greater extent to the decline in business dynamism in the euro area.
 39) 
39 According to the , life expectancy in 2021 was around 81 years in Germany, 82 years in France, 83 years OECD
in Italy and 83 years in Spain. In the United States, life expectancy was around 76 years.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 51The quality of the regulatory and institutional environment is another structural 
factor with a potential impact on business dynamism.  A functioning legal system and 
efficient administration are an important framework for business activity. Studies show 
that corruption or insufficient protection of intellectual property, for example, have a 
negative impact on business start-ups.  Difficult access to finance or an inefficient 
insolvency regime likewise place constraints on business dynamism.  In addition, the 
scale and nature of regulation have an impact on business dynamism. Impediments in 
product markets like a high administrative burden, privileges for individual professions

also evidence that rigidities in labour markets – such as very strict employment 
protection – dampen firm entries and exits.

based on a structural macroeconomic model suggest that lower regulatory market 
entry costs could provide a sustainable boost to business dynamism in the euro area.
In the euro area, there is potential for reform but only moderate reform 
momentum.  Clear evidence that regulatory and institutional barriers exist can be 
found, amongst other things, in the country-specific recommendations issued by the 
European Commission in the context of the European Semester.  These include, for 
example, reducing the administrative burden on enterprises or increasing the 
efficiency of the public administration and the judicial system.  The results of surveys 
amongst  enterprises fit this pattern, with firms complaining of complex EU

few.  Despite clear evidence that reforms are needed, data on the status of 
implementation of the European Commission’s recommendations indicate that the 
pace of reforms in the euro area in the areas labour market, product market and 
business environment has tended to ease off in recent years.
A number of studies point to the possible relationship between declining 
competition intensity and weak business dynamism. Competition between firms is an 
important mechanism for the efficient distribution of production resources. The 
intensity of competition is influenced by various factors. These include, for example, 
barriers to market entry, openness to foreign competition and anti-trust and 
competition regulations.  However, enterprises can also gain competitive advantages 
through innovations.  The macroeconomic consequences of weakening intensity of

other things, changes to insolvency law, the quality of the judicial system, access to financing for enterprises 
or the digitalisation of enterprises and public administrations.

Developments in euro area business dynamism
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 54competition have long been the subject of intense debate.  Recent analyses point to 
a possible dampening impact of increasing pricing power on business dynamism.  
For example, it is conceivable that incumbent firms exploit their market position to 
prevent potential competitors from entering the market.  A dominant market 
position as a result of technological progress or the growing importance of information-
based goods, which are characterised by comparatively high fixed costs and low 
marginal costs, can also explain a decline in business dynamism.
However, there is insufficient evidence of a causal relationship between 
competition intensity and business dynamism.  This also applies to the euro area. In 
addition to the difficult data situation with regard to business dynamism, this is likely 
due, in particular, to the fact that previous studies on developments in market 
concentration and price mark-ups in euro area countries paint a mixed picture. While 
there is evidence of a significant increase in market power, there are also estimates 
that suggest no, or at most a moderate, decline in the intensity of competition. 52)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 554 Conclusion
According to firm entry and exit rates, business dynamism in the large euro area 
countries has tended to weaken over the past few decades. This development may 
have caused misallocation in the corporate sector and is one possible explanation for 
the declining productivity growth in the euro area.
Cyclical factors are likely to be one element behind the slowdown in business 
dynamism in the euro area.  Uncertainty among market participants caused by the 
global financial and economic crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis is one 
explanation for the weak momentum in the firm entry rate in the post-crisis period. 
Developments in connection with the − 19 pandemic were another factor that COVID
weighed on business dynamism. Firm entry and exit rates may have been influenced by 
policy measures taken in the context of macroeconomic developments.
Indications that firm entry and exit rates were already declining before the global 
financial and economic crisis suggest that structural factors may have been at play 
as well.  These include, amongst others, demographic change. Excessive regulation and 
a lack of institutional quality are also likely to have a negative impact on business 
dynamism in the euro area.
Tasks such as the digital and the ecological transformation of the European 
economy will increase the relevance of a dynamic business landscape for growth 
and prosperity.  To capitalise on the potential offered by digitalisation, access to sales 
markets and production resources must be facilitated for innovative start-ups. For this 
to happen, unproductive firms must exit the market. The transition to a low-emission 
economy also calls for a dynamic market environment. The success of the ecological 
transformation depends, amongst other things, on how sensitive firms and sectors are 
to climate policy signals.
Structural reforms represent a key element of the scope of government action.  
Given the potential for reform, improving institutional and regulatory frameworks is an 
important option for strengthening business dynamism. Besides reforms at the  EU
level, national governments must also act. These can rely on a range of analyses and 
policy proposals, not least from international organisations and the European 
Commission. A fundamental improvement in framework conditions is needed to 
stimulate business dynamism in the long term.

65Demand for banknotes 
during crises: an 
international perspective

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 66Cash may serve as an anchor of confidence during times of crisis because of its status 
as default-proof central bank money and the fact that it can be used in emergency and 
crisis situations without the need for technical infrastructure. With that in mind, this 
article describes international demand for banknotes during a selection of crises. The 
case studies are based on time series relating to banknotes in circulation in a selection 
of 16 countries and currency areas across all continents in the period from 1990 to 
2022.
The information available on the growth in international demand for banknotes initially 
confirms the perception of increasing global demand for cash, despite the declining 
share of cash payments in many countries (paradox of banknotes). As such, the value of 
banknotes in circulation is rising for most of the currencies examined in this article, and 
is generally even increasing in relation to nominal gross domestic product ( ). GDP
Notable exceptions to this general rule are Norway and Sweden, where the value of 
banknotes in circulation has fallen sharply in relation to nominal . This is attributed GDP
in the literature to a declining demand for banknotes as a store of value.
In addition, case studies are used to illustrate the developments in banknote circulation 
during a number of different types of crises. The crises covered are the Asian financial 
crisis (Asian crisis) from 1997 to 1999, the millennium bug ( ), the terrorist attacks on Y2K
11 September 2001 (9/11), the global financial crisis of 2008, the −19 pandemic COVID
and the war in Ukraine, which began with the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022. 
This article makes a distinction between transaction motives, store-of-value motives 
and precautionary motives as factors driving the demand for banknotes. The different 
reasons for the demand for banknotes are taken into account by analysing the 
circulation of small and large-denomination banknotes separately.
The analysis is descriptive in nature and is intended primarily to generate hypotheses. 
Consequently, responses in demand for banknotes may be temporary and localised, 
and in some cases, the value of banknotes in circulation may fall as a result of a crisis. 
Viewed overall, however, the case studies suggest that crises are likely to have 
contributed to the dynamic growth in demand for banknotes in the countries analysed. 
This applies both to small and large banknote denominations. The increased demand 
for banknotes as a result of a crisis is probably due mainly to precautionary motives.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 671 Introduction
Cash is central bank money and is therefore immune to any default risk.  As a 
physical means of payment, it can also be used in emergencies and crises without the 
need for technical infrastructure, thus helping to ensure the continuity of payments in 
the event of technical disruptions or natural disasters. The role that cash plays in crises 
is frequently discussed with these characteristics in mind.  In fact, a marked increase 
in the value of euro banknotes in circulation was observed during the global financial 
crisis and the −19 pandemic, for instance. COVID
Against this backdrop, the Bundesbank has conducted selected case studies to 
investigate how demand for banknotes developed during crises.  The analyses are 
based on time series on the development of banknotes in circulation from 16 selected 
currencies in the period from1990 to 2022.  The demand for banknotes over time and 
in an international comparison is of fundamental interest; it is therefore presented in 
detail in Section 2 of the article, which focuses initially on general considerations. 
Meanwhile, Section 3 examines the demand for banknotes in times of crisis using a 
graphical analysis of a selection of countries and crises, with the focus being on six 
crises that occurred between 1997 and 2022.  The analysis differentiates between 
small and large-denomination banknotes to take account of their different uses.  For 
instance, small denominations are generally used to pay for goods and services 
(holdings for transaction purposes or transaction motives).  By contrast, large  1)

4 This article analyses banknotes in circulation and hence the demand for banknotes. The amount of cash in 
circulation is made up of the volume of banknotes and coins in circulation. As the volume of coins in 
circulation tends to be small in terms of value, growth in banknotes in circulation is also informative with 
regard to developments in the value of the demand for cash overall.
5 This concerns an extension of the descriptive part of the analysis conducted by and (2022, 2024). Rösl Seitz 
These analyses demonstrate that the demand for small and large-denomination banknotes in the country 
groups examined increased during the following crises: , financial crises, political crises, phases of inflation Y2K
and natural disasters including the −19 pandemic. Heinonen (2023) analyses the impact of  and the COVID Y2K
−19 pandemic on the value and number of banknotes in circulation in a broad country analysis using the COVID
annual growth rates of total banknotes in circulation as a basis. The scope of his sample ranges from 96 to 137 
different currencies.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 68denominations are typically in demand for the purpose of storing value in the context 
of portfolio allocation (store-of-value motives).  The relative return, relative risk and 
relative liquidity of the asset class are important when selecting assets for portfolio 
allocation. For example, the demand for banknotes as a store of value decreases with 
rising opportunity costs of holding cash, i.e. the interest rate on close substitutes for 
cash such as sight deposits at banks.  To understand the demand for banknotes 
during crises, it is helpful to also consider precautionary motives, which can result in 
demand for cash both for transaction purposes and also as a store of value. In 
principle, precautionary cash holdings serve to provide for unplanned or unexpected 
expenses. Precautionary motives are also significant during times of crisis and 
subsequently lead to demand for banknotes as a precautionary measure in response to 
(major) uncertainty. This includes safeguarding liquidity in the form of small-
denomination banknotes for transactions in the event of potential cash supply 
bottlenecks, as well as storing value by means of large-denomination banknotes in the 
event of fears of a banking collapse, stock market crash or political unrest.
The purpose of the explorative analysis is to describe the development of the 
demand for banknotes in a selection of crises and to derive hypotheses about the 
relationship between the demand for banknotes and crises.  However, the descriptive 
approach adopted is, as such, subject to a number of significant limitations. This means 
that it is not suited to testing hypotheses or determining causal effects. In particular, 
the control for the effects of other factors, which is key in empirical work, and 
statements on statistically significant effects and their magnitude are reserved for 
inferential statistical approaches, which will be pursued at a later stage. 8)

threshold is a purchasing power-adjusted value of $75. For currencies where all banknote denominations are US
lower than this value, the “large-denomination banknotes” category corresponds to the largest denomination.

they utilise eight different financial assets, including the sum of cash and sight deposits. According to their 
analysis, this most liquid asset is mainly a substitute for the other assets.
10 Transaction balances and holdings for store-of-value purposes also include precautionary cash balances in 
the broader sense. However, precautionary motives are considered separately here.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 70The banknote ratio in Morocco more than doubled during the period under 
investigation.  After increasing temporarily to 29% in 2020 as a result of the COVID −19  
pandemic, the ratio stood at just under 27% in 2022. With the exception of Japan, this is 
therefore significantly higher than the corresponding ratio for developed advanced 
economies. It is likely that the rapid rise in the banknote ratio in Morocco was driven by 


Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 71the demand for large denominations as a store of value. Saidi et al. (2023) estimate that 
the hoarded share of the two largest banknote denominations increased from around 
20% at the start of the millennium to between 60% and 80% in 2021.  12)  
Of the four Asian countries analysed, the ratio of banknotes in circulation to GDP  as 
a measure of cash use is relatively stable in Indonesia.  In Türkiye, the banknote ratio 
rose between 2005 and 2016 before dropping back to its starting level by 2022.  13)  At 
the same time, in terms of sales, the share of cash transactions at the point of sale 
remained essentially unchanged in the period between 2012 and 2019, i.e. cash 
spending increased in proportion to consumer spending.  14)  The banknote ratio in 
Japan shows a marked upward trend and stood at an exceptionally high level of 22.5% 
in 2022. Main drivers of this development are likely to have been low interest rates, 
falling prices and concerns about bank stability after the real estate market bubble 
burst in the early 1990s.  15)  Fujiki and Nakashima (2019) explain the increase in the ratio 
of currency in circulation to GDP  in Japan as being due to strong hoarding demand, 
despite advances in the area of cashless payments. They add that this offset the 
negative effect of substituting cash with cashless payment instruments for day-to-day 
payments.  16)  In India, at just under 9 %, the ratio of banknotes in circulation to GDP  in 
1990 was on a par with Japan. It has mostly been on the rise since then, reaching just 
under 13% in 2022. The temporary dip in 2016 came on the back of demonetisation on  
8 November that year, when the Indian government took the surprise step of 
withdrawing the two largest rupee denominations (500 and 1,000 Indian rupee 
banknotes) in the Mahatma Gandhi series from circulation, which came into effect at 
midnight on the same day.  17)  By taking this measure, the government sought to seize 
undeclared income and increase the tax base.  18)  Demonetisation triggered a decline in

and 2020. See Kanno (2022).
17 It was announced that the 500 rupee banknote would be replaced by a newly designed banknote. However, 
there were no plans to replace the 1,000 rupee banknote with a banknote of the same denomination. Instead, 
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) would issue a completely new 2,000 rupee banknote. Given that the two 
banknotes withdrawn from circulation accounted for 86% of all cash in circulation, many households were 
immediately hit by severe liquidity restrictions. On 19 May 2023, the RBI announced the withdrawal of the 2,000 
rupee banknote from circulation and advised the general public to deposit these notes in bank accounts or 
exchange them for other denominations at commercial banks or the RBI by 30 September 2023. The banknotes 
can still be exchanged at the RBI until further notice. In addition, the 2,000 rupee banknote retains its status as 
legal tender and can thus continue to be used for transactions.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 72 cash transactions at the point of sale. In terms of sales, this share fell by around  
30 percentage points between 2012 and 2019, with the three years following 
demonetisation accounting for 17 percentage points alone.  19)  
Overall, the banknote ratio in Australia moved sideways with a number of 
fluctuations.  Of particular note are the temporary crisis-related increases (peaks) in 
1999 ( Y2K), 2001 (9/11), 2008 (global financial crisis) and 2020 ( COVID −19 pandemic).  20)  
Having reached an all-time high of just under 5% in 2020, the ratio of banknotes in 
circulation to GDP  remained at a moderately elevated level by historical standards, 
standing at 4.2% in 2022.  21)  The demand for banknotes for transaction purposes is 
falling. The share of cash payments in the total volume of payments (by value) in the 
retail sector dropped from 38% in 2007 to 11% in 2019.  22)  Apart from the holdings 
maintained as a store of value, currency holdings outside Australia are likely to have 
played a role in the increase in total circulation. For instance, there is evidence that the 
banknote denomination with the highest face value (A$100) is in demand outside 
Australia.  23)  
The countries selected in Europe can be divided into three groups.  The first group 
comprises the two Scandinavian countries Norway and Sweden. Banknotes in 
circulation have fallen significantly in Sweden since 2010 and in Norway since 2016. The 
banknote ratio in both countries has dropped significantly since the early 1990s, and 
most recently stood at a mere 1%. Despite the growing significance of digital means of 
payment, Claussen et al. (2023) attribute this deviation from the paradox of banknotes 
 24)  primarily to declining demand for cash as a store of value and not to a drop in 
demand for cash for transaction purposes.  25)  They put the decline in the circulation of 
large denominations (in demand as a store of value) in Sweden down to the general 
19 See Khiaonarong and Humphrey (2022, Figure 1 (a)).
20 These and other crises are investigated in more detail in Section 3 with regard to the effect they had on the 
annual growth rate of small and large-denomination banknotes in circulation.  
21 See Guttmann (2022) and Lowe (2017).  
22 See Guttmann (2022).  
23 See Flannigan and Parsons (2018). Finlay et al. (2019) estimate that between 15% and 35% of all banknotes in 
circulation are used for legitimate payment transactions. Between 4% and 7% are used to settle payments in 
the shadow economy. The remainder is held for purposes other than transactions. The bulk of this is probably 
hoarded (of which up to 15 percentage points abroad). An estimated 5% to 10% are held in collections. 
Elkington and Guttmann (2024) demonstrate that the share of banknotes used for transaction purposes in the 
total circulation of banknotes fell by 5 percentage points during the COVID −19 pandemic. According to their 
estimates, this share is now between 9% and 26% and the share of Australian banknotes hoarded (in Australia 
or abroad) is between 55% and 80%.  
24 The paradox of banknotes refers to the phenomenon that the demand for cash has grown substantially since 
the early 1990s, although the share of cash payments at the point of sale is on the decline.
25 In Norway, the ratio of both small and large-denomination banknotes in circulation to  fell during the GDP
observation period. This also applies to the ratio of large-denomination banknotes in circulation to nominal  GDP
in Sweden. By contrast, the banknote ratio of small denominations in Sweden only began to decline from 2010 
onwards.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 73public’s positive experience of the government’s crisis management in the country. 
According to Claussen et al., this has reduced incentives to hold large banknotes as a 
means of hedging against uncertainty. The second group comprises the United 
Kingdom. The share of cash payments in total payment transactions there fell from just 
over 80% in 1990 to just under 20% in 2020.  26)  Nonetheless, the ratio of banknotes in 
circulation to GDP  has been trending upwards in the period under investigation and is 
now at a historically high level. This points to higher demand for banknotes as a store 
of value, which can probably be explained by historically low interest rates and the 
associated low opportunity costs of holding money, for instance.  27)  Demand for the 
largest denomination (50 pound banknote) from other countries is also likely to have 
played a role in the growing banknote ratio.  28)  The third group comprises the euro 
area, Poland and Switzerland. This group has seen the banknote ratio rise sharply, but 
this trend has only been observed in Switzerland since the global financial crisis in 
2008. Standing at 11.8% in the euro area and Poland, and 10.6% in Switzerland in 2022, 
this ratio was high by international standards. In the euro area, strong foreign demand 
for euro banknotes was a contributing factor. It is estimated that between 30% and 
50% of the (net) value of euro banknotes issued by the Eurosystem are in circulation 
abroad.  29)  Foreign demand is also likely to play a role in the case of Swiss franc 
banknotes.  30)  
In the three North American countries analysed, the banknote ratios have been 
rising significantly both in Mexico since 1997, and in the United States since the 
global financial crisis in 2008, reaching just under 9% in both countries in 2022.  The  
reason for this comparatively elevated figure in Mexico may be the fact that cash plays 
an important role in the country, both as a store of value and for payments.  31)  During 
the global financial crisis, the banknote ratio rose steadily by just under 1 percentage 
point before flattening out in the period up to 2011. Antón et al. (2021) explain that the 
additional increase observed from 2013 onwards was due to a series of measures 
introduced that year to improve tax enforcement in Mexico, such as making electronic 
invoices mandatory and increasing the number of taxpayers. They argue that 
intensifying tax enforcement in this way may lead to attempted tax avoidance, resulting

pound sterling fell sharply. See Butt and Reid (2022).

30 According to estimates by et al. (2019), significant holdings of the 1,000 and 200 franc banknote Assenmacher 
in particular are hoarded (either in Switzerland or abroad). The share that is hoarded abroad is not specified, 
however.
31 Surveys conducted by the Banco de México found that around 95% of the population use cash as a means of 
payment, while debit and credit card use has been low to date. 63% of the general public hold cash as a store 
of value. See Noriega (2022).  

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 74In Brazil, the banknote ratio rose from just under 1.9% in 1995 to 3.9% in 2009 . A 
temporary increase in 2002 was likely due to political uncertainty in connection with the 
presidential elections in October 2002, which led to a steep rise in inflation and the 
devaluation of the Brazilian real. Excluding the temporary surge during the COVID −19 
pandemic, the ratio of banknotes in circulation to GDP  fell slightly following the global 
financial crisis. The sharp decline in the use of cash at the point of sale is likely to have 
been a contributing factor. In terms of sales, it fell by around 40 percentage points in an increase in the cash in circulation. The ratio of banknotes in circulation to GDP  in 
Mexico was boosted further during the COVID −19 pandemic, when it rose by  
2 percentage points. The increasing banknote ratio in the United States reflects the 
ongoing growth in overall demand for cash in the country. The reason for this is 
presumably that cash is being used increasingly as a store of value while being used 
less as a means of payment.  32)  The trend in the banknote ratio in the United States is 
moving in line with the circulation of US dollar banknotes abroad. For example, the 
different estimation methods in Judson (2017) point to strong international demand in 
the 1990s, a decline in the early 2000s and a sustained resurgence since the collapse of 
the bank Lehman Brothers. According to their estimates, the share of US dollar 
banknotes in circulation abroad in the total circulation of US dollar banknotes rose in 
the period leading up to the global financial crisis and has been at around 50% since 
then, albeit showing a slight downward trend. In Canada, the banknote ratio ranged 
between 3% and 4% until the start of the COVID −19 pandemic. It has been on a slightly 
upward trend since the financial crisis. Thus, in contrast to a comparable country such 
as Sweden, the diminishing role played by cash reserved for transaction purposes in 
Canada has not yet led to a sustained reduction in demand for banknotes.  33)  According 
to Claussen et al. (2023), this can be explained by the ongoing rise in large-  
denomination banknotes in circulation in Canada, which may have been driven by 
foreign demand in recent years . As in the United States, crises also caused the 
banknote ratio in Canada to rise temporarily in 1999 ( Y2K) and 2020 ( COVID −19 
pandemic) (peaks).  
 34) 32 See Replogle (2022).
33 Engert et al. (2019) point out a number of similarities between Canada and Sweden. Both are small, open 
economies bordering much larger economies (the United States and the euro area, respectively). Both 
countries have their own national currency and the general public in each country has easy access to 
international reserve currencies (  dollar and euro). Digital infrastructure is highly developed in Canada and US
Sweden. In a global comparison, both countries are frontrunners in the use of cashless payment methods. 
Finally, over the past few decades, several payment innovations in these countries (e.g. Swish in Sweden and 
Interac e-Transfer in Canada) have contributed to the decline in cash payments.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 75In spite of the falling share of cash payments at the point of sale, banknotes in 
circulation in terms of value are on an upward trend in the majority of the countries 
presented here and are even increasing in relation to gross domestic product 
(paradox of banknotes). This means that demand for the physical form of central bank 
money, i.e. cash, remains high. In the discussion surrounding the underlying factors, it 
has already become clear that crises can stimulate demand for banknotes. For instance, 
since the global financial crisis, the number of banknotes in circulation has been 
growing faster than before in many advanced economies. The next section takes a 
detailed look at demand for banknotes during times of crisis.between 2013 and 2019.  34)  Nonetheless, cash continues to play an important role in  
payment transactions. For example, in the latest survey conducted by Banco Central do 
Brasil (as at 2018), around 60% of respondents cited cash as their most frequently used 
means of payment.  35)

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 763 Demand for banknotes in times of crisis
Economic studies point to a statistically significant link between crises and 
banknotes in circulation.  For the graphical analyses in this article, crises are first 
identified in which there was a noticeable change in banknote circulation in the 
selected countries. In line with Rösl and Seitz (2024), the crises can be assigned to the 
following categories: uncertainty with respect to digital infrastructure, crises of 
confidence in the financial system, natural disasters, political uncertainty, inflation 
crises and exchange rate crises. The results for some selected crises are presented 
below.  In general, only countries where there was a significant change in the value 
of banknotes in circulation during a crisis are included. A uniform, objective criterion 
for defining what is meant by a “significant” change in this context will be established in 
this article. In doing so, it is important to avoid setting a threshold that is too low or too 
high. Setting the value too low increases the risk of including cases in which the 
fluctuation in the circulation of banknotes during a crisis was merely random. By 
contrast, setting the threshold too high could result in the exclusion of countries where 
there were actual changes in banknote circulation due to a crisis. The definition chosen 
here is based on unusually large changes in the annual growth rate of banknotes in 
circulation. “Large change” in this context means “amplitude of growth” of at least 5 
percentage points. Amplitude of growth refers to the maximum increase (or decrease) 
in the annual growth rate  during a crisis, i.e. the difference between the highest (or 
lowest) value during the crisis and the value recorded immediately before the crisis  36)

37 The charts presented in this article are based on monthly annual growth rates of small and large-
denomination banknotes. For Poland, only quarterly data on banknote circulation are available. For India, 
banknote circulation by denomination is only available on an annual basis and monthly figures are only 
available for total banknote circulation. Therefore, Poland and India are not shown in the following charts. The 
results for these countries are taken into account in the text in the footnotes, although for India, this applies 
only to the results for total banknote circulation.
38 The use of annual growth rates can lead to the threshold being exceeded due to a base effect if this time 
series includes a downward outlier one year before the onset of the crisis. More generally, outliers (upward or 
downward) can influence or even distort the annual growth rates in the crisis period if they occur up to one 
year before the crisis. This issue can be seen, for example, in the annual growth rate of large-denomination 
banknotes in Indonesia in the corresponding chart on the COVID −19 pandemic. The response period of this time 
series covers the period from March 2020 to April 2021. In May 2019, it shows a positive upward outlier of 
approximately 22%, which resulted in a downward outlier of approximately − 2% in May 2020. However, the 
problem of finding a suitable pre-crisis level is also encountered when adopting alternative approaches.  

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 77began.  The “response period” refers to the period in which there is an unusually 
sharp rise or fall in banknote circulation in a country during a crisis. The response 
period begins with the month in which the annual growth rate of banknotes in 
circulation in value terms deviates by at least one percentage point from its level of the 
previous month, and ends in the month in which the annual growth rate has stabilised 
at a new level (the pre-crisis level, for instance). The response period varies from 
country to country. The “aggregated” response periods shown in the charts comprise 
the individual response periods of the countries depicted and therefore indicate the 
period in which banknote circulation was unusual in at least one of these countries. In 
order to take account of the different motives behind the demand for banknotes, the 
annual growth rates of both small and large-denomination banknotes are examined.
This approach is used to describe the development of banknote demand in several 
selected crises.  Hypotheses about the relationship between banknote demand and 
crises can be drawn from the cases presented here, but it is not the aim of this article to 
make any statements about systematic relationships. In particular, it is important to 
note that although the focus on case studies with clear developments in the demand 
for banknotes increases the clarity of the presentation, this should not be taken to 
mean that crises always have a strong impact on banknote demand. Instead, the 
results show that the global crises outlined in this article do not necessarily have visible 
significant effects in all the scenarios analysed.
3.1 Uncertainty with respect to digital infrastructure
The demand for banknotes during crises due to uncertainty with respect to digital 
infrastructure is described on the basis of the year 2000 problem ( Y2K, millennium 
bug).  This involved making changes in the way years were represented in computer 
programs in order to display years in the new millennium correctly. There were fears 
that because the year had been shortened to two digits in program codes, computer  39)

39 The analysis could be refined by using country-specific threshold values for the amplitude of growth 
depending on the level and volatility of the annual growth rates of banknotes in circulation. It can be seen, 
however, that countries with high annual growth rates like Brazil, Indonesia and Türkiye generally also have 
significantly higher amplitudes of growth, which makes these countries more likely to be categorised as 
abnormal at higher threshold values.

The annual growth rates of large-denomination banknotes in circulation rose 
significantly during YK2 in 10 of the 16 countries analysed. This increase was likely 
driven by precaution, as investors may have expanded their banknote holdings to

savings at short notice.  Mexico was the first country to be affected, in September

of  was felt in Indonesia, Mexico and Türkiye, which are also the countries with the Y2K
highest annual growth rates. For example, the annual growth rate's amplitude of 
growth in Mexico (in the period from September 1999 to January 2001) was just under 
45 percentage points, and in December 1999, the annual growth rate in Indonesia rose 
by around 33 percentage points. In all countries, the biggest increase was seen in 
December 1999. After the turn of the millennium, the one-off period of uncertainty 
associated with the millennium bug dissipated.
In ten countries, Y2K brought about a sharp increase in the annual growth rate of 
small-denomination banknotes as well.  This was probably also due to precautionary 
measures, which led to an increase in transaction balances in view of growing 
uncertainty regarding the availability of the infrastructure for digital payments.  As 
with large denominations, the strongest effects for small denominations were 
observed in all countries in December 1999. The highest amplitude of growth was seen 
in Indonesia (around 41 percentage points) and Canada (around 24 percentage points).

3.2 Crisis of confidence in the financial system
The demand for banknotes during crises of confidence in the financial system is 
analysed on the basis of the 2008 global financial crisis.  The crisis began in 2007 in 
the  subprime market and reached its peak with the collapse of the major bank US
Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008. This brought the interbank market to a 
standstill worldwide. Investors feared that their bank deposits were not secure. This 
was followed by a global recession and the launch of bank rescue packages, which 
triggered sovereign debt crises due to rising risk premia on government bonds.
 45) 
45 In Poland, the annual growth rate of the circulation of small denominations reacted to  from the fourth Y2K
quarter of 1999 until the first quarter of 2000. The amplitude of growth was around 5 percentage points.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 81The 2008 global financial crisis led primarily to an increase in demand for large-
denomination banknotes, which are particularly suitable for store-of-value 
purposes. Given the extensive crises of confidence, the increase in precautionary cash 
holdings is likely to have played an important role in this regard.  Annual growth 
rates of large-denomination banknotes in circulation rose sharply in half of the 16 
countries analysed here. The first effects were seen in Indonesia, Switzerland and 
Türkiye in September 2008 and in the other countries in October 2008. The effects 
lasted longest in the United States (from October 2008 to December 2009), the country 
where the crisis had originated. The two countries with the highest annual growth 
rates, Indonesia and Türkiye, stand out from the other six countries as the effects of 
the crisis lasted for the shortest period of time there: in Indonesia they were seen only 
in September 2008 and in Türkiye from September 2008 to March 2009. In the other 
countries, the annual growth rate responded to the crisis until at least September 2009. 
In addition, the annual growth rate was strongest in Türkiye, with an amplitude of 
growth of roughly 35 percentage points, and in Indonesia, with an amplitude of growth 
of around 14 percentage points. Ultimately, the increase in the circulation of large-
denomination banknotes (in national currency) was only temporary in Indonesia and 
Türkiye, while it remained permanently above its pre-crisis level in Australia, the euro 
area, Mexico, Switzerland, the United States and the United Kingdom. The annual  46)

during the global financial crisis. They attribute 20% of the increase to lower interest rates (store-of-value 
motive) and government assistance payments to households and the remainder to increased caution among 
members of the public who had concerns about the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions as well as 
banks in the event of an emergency.  

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 82growth rate profile in the euro area corresponds to the level of a one-time, permanent 
increase in the circulation of large-denomination banknotes (in euro) in October 2008. 
This also roughly applies to Switzerland.  In principle, it is not unusual for the effects 
of crises to persist.
 
Only Australia, Indonesia, Mexico and Türkiye saw a significant increase in the 
annual growth rate of small-denomination banknotes in circulation during the 
global financial crisis.  In the light of the crisis of confidence in the banking system, the 
main reason for this was probably to secure liquidity for transactions as a 
precautionary measure. The increase in Mexico – an amplitude of growth of around 8 
percentage points – was weaker than in the other three countries, which had an

47 The annual growth rate of large-denomination banknotes in circulation in Poland was affected by the global 
financial crisis from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2009, rising sharply, with an amplitude 
of growth of around 19 percentage points.
48 For instance, the structural time series models estimated by et al. (2023) show that since the Bartzsch 
introduction of euro banknotes, various crises have led to a trend break (at the local level and in the local 
slope) in the circulation of all denominations of euro banknotes in Germany, France and Spain. By contrast, 
these effects were only temporary in Italy, i.e. they were outliers. This suggests that transitory shocks, as such, 
may have persistent effects on banknotes in circulation. A statistical explanation for this phenomenon is that 
banknote circulation usually displays a stochastic trend, i.e. this is an I(1) process. A possible economic 
explanation for the lasting effects of one-time shocks is offered by the habit-persistence hypothesis. 
Alternatively, the low level of interest rates following the global financial crisis could also have played a role.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 83amplitude of growth of around 18 percentage points. In Indonesia and Türkiye, the 
annual growth rate only responded in September 2009, with the circulation of small-
denomination banknotes in these two countries (in Indonesian rupiah and Turkish lira, 
respectively) increasing only temporarily in that month. In October, it returned to its 
pre-crisis level. The global financial crisis had a much longer impact on the annual 
growth rate of small-denomination banknotes in circulation in Australia (from October 
2008 to September 2009) and Mexico (from October 2008 to June 2009). Australia was 
the only country to see a sustained increase in small-denomination banknotes in 
circulation (in Australian dollars) as a result of the global financial crisis.
3.3 Natural disasters
The demand for banknotes during natural disasters is illustrated using the example 
of the COVID −19 pandemic, which broke out at the start of 2020.  The onset of the 
pandemic was rapidly followed by comprehensive quarantine measures, lockdowns 
and a worldwide recession. The repercussions for banknote circulation are described in 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2022). This shows that banknote circulation in value terms grew 
strongly during the pandemic, even though the online trade gained market share and 
consumers increasingly paid using cashless instruments in shops due to 
their – ultimately unfounded  – fear that the virus could be transmitted via banknotes.
 The accumulation of banknotes during the first few months of the pandemic is 
therefore likely to be attributable to precautionary behaviour with regard to potential 
logistical restrictions on the supply of cash. The increases declined in the ensuing 
period, though banknote demand remained at an elevated level internationally. The 
sharp rise in the value of large-denomination banknotes in circulation was not just a 
case of a general increase in cash holdings as a store of value, a phenomenon typical of 
crises (precautionary motive). In this case, the storing of cash is also likely to have been 
partly caused by a lack of spending opportunities. 49)

49 The annual growth rate of small-denomination banknotes in circulation in Poland was affected by the global 
financial crisis from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009. At around 6 percentage points, its 
amplitude of growth was far below that of the annual growth rate of large-denomination banknotes.

term is more typically used to describe unusual natural events such as earthquakes, storms and forest fires.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 84In the majority of countries analysed, the COVID −19 pandemic had a clear impact on 
the annual growth rates of banknotes in circulation.  Small-denomination banknotes 
responded to this crisis in a similar number of countries and – when measured in terms 
of the amplitude of growth – roughly as strongly as large-denomination banknotes did. 
The growth of the former was presumably driven by precautionary reasons, while in 
the case of the latter, store-of-value motives probably loomed large as well.  In most 
countries, the initial impact on the annual growth rate of large-denomination 
banknotes in circulation became apparent in March 2020. The crisis proved most 
prolonged in Canada (lasting until August 2022). The annual growth rate of large-
 53) 
53 Chen et al. (2020) put forward the following reasons for the strong rise in the value of small-denomination 
banknotes in circulation in Canada at the start of the pandemic. First, financial institutions ramped up their 
cash holdings for precautionary reasons. Second, retailers paid less cash into banks than would normally be 
the case. And third, consumer demand for cash increased.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 85denomination banknotes in circulation was greatest in Türkiye (amplitude of growth of 
around 66 percentage points), followed by Brazil (amplitude of growth of 
approximately 42 percentage points). Brazil was also confronted with a strong rise in 
inflation and therefore also in the opportunity costs of holding cash.  Unlike in the 
other crises, the annual growth rate of banknotes in circulation also fell (strongly) in a 
few countries, notably Morocco and Norway. That said, the value of large-denomination 
banknotes in circulation in Morocco (in Moroccan dirham) continued to rise, albeit less 
strongly than before the pandemic. By contrast, in Norway the pandemic had the effect 
of accelerating a downward trend in the circulation of large-denomination banknotes 
(in Norwegian krone) that dated back to 2007. In Australia, Brazil, the euro area, 
Indonesia, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Türkiye and the United States, the value of large-
denomination banknotes in circulation (in national currency) increased in a lasting way. 54) 
 55) 
54 Due to the high level of inflation, even large-denomination banknotes may have been increasingly used for 
transaction purposes. This is borne out by the introduction of a banknote with the value of 200 Brazilian real.
55 The −19 pandemic influenced the annual growth rate of large-denomination banknotes in circulation in COVID
Poland from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, prompting this growth rate to rise very 
strongly (amplitude of growth of just under 47 percentage points). In India, the pandemic had an impact on 
the annual growth rate of total banknote circulation in terms of value from May 2020 to February 2021. The 
corresponding amplitude of growth amounted to around 7 percentage points.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 86The COVID −19 pandemic had the most prolonged impact on the annual growth rate 
of small-denomination banknotes in circulation in the United Kingdom (May 2020 to 
April 2022).  This annual growth rate exhibited by far the greatest amplitude of growth 
in Türkiye (around 57 percentage points) and Brazil (around 40 percentage points) on 
account of the −19 pandemic. Unlike in other crises, there were also COVID
countries – namely Japan and Morocco – where this annual growth rate declined.  By 
contrast, in Australia, Brazil, the euro area, Canada, Mexico, Norway, Türkiye, the

56 The slump in the annual growth rate in Indonesia in May 2020 can be explained by the base effect in May 
2019 when this rate increased significantly for a time. There is therefore no link to the −19 pandemic in this COVID
case.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 87United States and the United Kingdom, the additional demand resulting from 
precautionary motives more than offset the decline in cash payments at point of sale 
(transaction motive) and, with the sole exception of Brazil, the value of small-
denomination banknotes in circulation increased in these countries permanently.
3.4 Political uncertainty
The impact of crises on the demand for banknotes due to political uncertainty is 
illustrated using the examples of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and – more 
recently – the war in Ukraine.
3.4.1 Terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001
The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 (9/11) had far-reaching political and 
economic consequences. On this day, Islamist terrorists brought catastrophe to New 
York by flying two hijacked aeroplanes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. 
A third aircraft crashed into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the  Department of US
Defense. A total of around 3,000 people were killed by these terrorist attacks. 57) 
57 In Poland, the −19 pandemic had an impact on the annual growth rate of small-denomination COVID
banknotes in circulation from the first quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of that year, resulting in this rate 
rising sharply (amplitude of growth of around 15 percentage points).

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 88Only in Australia did the annual growth rate of large-denomination banknotes in 
circulation respond significantly to the events of 9/11.  Here, it exhibited an amplitude 
of growth of around 6 percentage points, rising between October 2001 and March 
2002, before then falling back to its pre-crisis level by September 2002. The rise in the 
circulation of these banknotes (in Australian dollars) was a lasting one. It seems likely 
that the precautionary holdings of these banknotes were stocked up on account of the 
political uncertainty that followed the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. In 
contrast to the other charts, it seems appropriate here to show countries such as the 
United States and Sweden, where the crisis did affect the value of banknotes in 
circulation, but – as per the definition applied here – had no significant impact. 
Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the annual growth rate of large-
denomination banknotes in circulation in Sweden (September 2001 to November 2001) 
and the United States (October 2001 to October 2002) initially increased with an 
amplitude of growth of just under 4 percentage points, before subsequently falling 
back to its pre-crisis level. The corresponding rise in the value of large-denomination 


Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 89The annual growth rate of small-denomination banknotes in circulation rose 
significantly in Australia and Sweden.  As was the case for large-denomination 
banknotes, this rise was probably attributable to precautionary motives. The 
development in both countries was similar to that of the annual growth rate of large-
denomination banknotes in circulation, but the amplitude of growth was significantly 
greater, namely 31 percentage points in Australia and just under 10 percentage points 
in Sweden. As with large-denomination banknotes, only in Australia – and not in 
Sweden – did the circulation of small-denomination banknotes (in national currency) 
remain permanently above its pre-crisis level.
In summary, it may be asserted that the additional demand for banknotes as a 
result of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 mainly affected small 
denominations. Given the background of political uncertainty, this was presumably 
attributable to precautionary motives. Relevant effects were only seen in Australia and 
Sweden, with the rise in the circulation of small denominations proving to be 
permanent in Australia only. In the United States, the target country of the terrorist 
attacks, banknote circulation did not change significantly.
3.4.2 War in Ukraine
The war in Ukraine started with the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 
2022 and continues to this day.  This is the largest armed conflict in Europe since the 
Second World War. The West imposed severe sanctions on Russia. Among the serious 
economic consequences of this war and the associated sanctions for the global 
economy, price increases for energy and food – in some cases significant ones – were 
the most evident.banknotes in circulation (in national currency) was probably not a lasting one in 
Sweden, whereas in the United States – the target country of the terrorist attacks  
of 9/11 – it presumably was.  58)  
 59) 
58 In Poland, 9/11 had an impact on the annual growth rate of large-denomination banknotes in circulation 
from the third quarter of 2001 until the fourth quarter of 2002. This rate increased strongly with an amplitude 
of growth of just under 27 percentage points.
59 In Poland, the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 had an impact on the annual growth rate of small-
denomination banknotes in circulation from the third quarter of 2001 until the fourth quarter of 2002. This 
rate rose sharply with an amplitude of growth of around 16 percentage points.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 90The annual growth rate of large-denomination banknotes in circulation rose 
significantly in Indonesia, Morocco, Norway and Türkiye as the war in Ukraine 
unfolded. This is likely to have been driven by precautionary motives in the face of 
economic and political uncertainty triggered by this conflict. In the case of Norway and 
Türkiye, geographical proximity will also have played a role. In Morocco, as in other 
countries of the Maghreb region, this war led to sharp price rises and a shortage of 
essential foods.  The crisis-related increase in demand for large-denomination 
banknotes in Morocco could therefore be attributable to transaction motives as well as 
precautionary motives. The first effects of the war in Ukraine on the annual growth rate 
of banknotes in circulation manifested themselves in Indonesia (from February 2022 to 
April 2022). The amplitudes of growth of large-denomination banknotes in circulation

60 In 2022, the rate of inflation in Morocco stood at around 6.7%, compared with 1.4% a year earlier. This was 
its highest level recorded since 1991.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 91ranged from 5 percentage points in Norway to just over 19 percentage points in 
Türkiye. In Indonesia and Türkiye, the circulation of large-denomination banknotes (in 
national currency) persisted at an elevated level even after the above-mentioned 
periods.
The war in Ukraine also caused a rise in the annual growth rate of small-domination 
banknotes in circulation in Indonesia, Morocco and Türkiye.  As was the case for large 
denominations, this additional demand was probably attributable to people stocking 
up their cash reserves for precautionary reasons.  Norway was not (significantly) 
affected, but its neighbour Sweden was. In Indonesia, Morocco (from April 2022 to 
December 2022), and Türkiye (in April 2022), the crisis had an impact over the same 
period as it did for large-denomination banknotes, while for Sweden this impact lasted 
from March to December 2022. Amplitudes of growth ranged from just under 10 
percentage points in Morocco and Türkiye to around 15 percentage points in 
Indonesia. From June 2022 onwards, the circulation of small-denomination banknotes 
in Indonesia (in Indonesian rupiah) reverted back to its pre-crisis level. In Türkiye, this 
circulation (in Turkish lira) remained above the pre-crisis level.
The visible repercussions appear to have been the same for small and large-
denomination banknotes.  The additional demand for large-denomination banknotes 
in Norway and small-denomination banknotes in Sweden is striking given that both 
these countries have made considerable progress along the path to a cashless society. 
The exposed geographical situation of these two countries no doubt proved a 
contributory factor.

61 It is not surprising that the war in Ukraine also left its mark on its immediate neighbour Poland. For instance, 
the annual growth rate of large-denomination banknotes in circulation in Poland rose by just over 7 
percentage points in the first quarter of 2022.
62 Cyberattacks may have been one driving force behind this development. In such situations, payments can be 
made with cash without any reliance on technical infrastructure. According to the Federal Office for 
Information Security (2023), the threat situation in cyberspace and for critical infrastructure in Germany is 
greater than ever before.
63 In Poland, the annual growth rate of small-denomination banknotes in circulation rose by just under 6 
percentage points in the first quarter of 2022.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 923.5 Exchange rate crises
The impact of exchange rate crises on banknotes in circulation is illustrated using 
the example of the Asian crisis,  which started off as an exchange rate crisis and 
then impacted on other areas of the economy.  First of all this crisis is summarised 
using the example of Indonesia, as it was here that the repercussions were the most 
severe.  The crisis first manifested itself in Thailand in March 1997 before spreading 
to other countries such as Indonesia. In July 1997, the Indonesian rupiah came under 
pressure. In August 1997, the peg to the  dollar was removed, prompting the US
Indonesian rupiah to slump in value. Following multiple market interventions by Bank 
Indonesia, which also tightened monetary policy, the crisis then spread to the banking 
sector. In October 1997, 16 banks were closed. After a certain time lag, the real 
economy was also affected as a result of banks restricting lending and lending rates 
rising dramatically. The economic recession in turn provoked social unrest and a loss of 
confidence in the government. In November 1997, the  approved a Standby Credit IMF
Facility arrangement amounting to $10.1 billion. In January 1998, the Indonesian US
Bank Restructuring Agency ( ) was founded in order to relieve the financial sector of IBRA
its high debt burden. In July 1999, the Indonesian government announced a plan to 
liquidate the  banks. IBRA 65)

countries analysed here, exchange rate crises affected only a proportion of these countries.

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 93During the Asian crisis, the annual growth rates of large-denomination banknotes 
in circulation increased noticeably in Indonesia, Japan and Türkiye.  As was the case 
in the global financial crisis of 2008, this additional demand was probably attributable 
to both precautionary and store-of-value motives. The crisis first had an impact on 
Japan (November 1997 to October 1998) and the effects were felt for the longest 
duration in Indonesia (May 1998 to May 1999). Türkiye was affected from January 1998 
to March 1999. The rise in the annual growth rate was particularly pronounced in 
Indonesia (amplitude of growth of around 102 percentage points) and in Türkiye 
(amplitude of growth of around 61 percentage points). In Indonesia, this increase went 
hand in hand with a sharp rise in the rate of inflation.  Owing to high inflation, even 
large-denomination banknotes could have been used increasingly for transaction 
 68) 
 69) 68 In Indonesia, the annual rate of inflation rose from 49.7% in May 1998 to as much as 82.4% in September 
1998, before then falling back down to 30.7% by May 1999.  

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 94purposes.  Compared with Indonesia and Türkiye, the effects in Japan were small 
(amplitude of growth of around 6 percentage points). Japan was not affected by the 
Asian crisis directly, but rather indirectly via its trading partners. The increase in the 
circulation of large-denomination banknotes (in national currency) during the Asian 
financial crisis is likely to have been a lasting one in all three countries.
According to the criteria outlined at the beginning of this article, only in Indonesia 
did the annual growth rate of small-domination banknotes in circulation respond to 
the Asian crisis, doing so over the entire duration of the crisis (March 1997 to August 
1999).  This rate increased very sharply with an amplitude of growth of around 69 
percentage points. After the crisis, the circulation of small denominations (in 
Indonesian rupiah) remained clearly above its pre-crisis level.
Overall, the Asian financial crisis (Asian crisis) from 1997 to 1999 had an impact on 
only a few of the countries analysed here, resulting primarily in an increase in 
demand for large-denomination banknotes.  Both precautionary and store-of-value 
motives were the likely driving forces in this case. As a result of this crisis, the 
circulation of these banknotes increased in a lasting way in Indonesia, Japan and 
Türkiye. 69)

69 On the other hand, the opportunity costs of holding cash also rose against a backdrop of inflation. In such a 
scenario, holding banknotes as a store of value is less appealing.
70 In India, the annual growth rate of total banknote circulation during the Asian crisis exhibited striking 
characteristics between August 1998 and August 1999, increasing with an amplitude of growth of just under

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 954 Concluding remarks
This article explores global developments in demand for banknotes with the aim, in 
particular, of describing banknote demand during crises using selected examples. 
The general analysis of banknote demand initially confirms the paradox of banknotes 
already described in the literature, namely that demand for cash has risen strongly 
since the start of the 1990s, even though consumers are increasingly using cashless 
means of payment.
The analysis of a selection of countries and crises in conjunction with striking 
developments in banknote circulation makes it possible to derive hypotheses on the 
relationship between crises and demand for banknotes. It emerges that crises – even 
if they deliver a general shock to all countries, such as was the case with the global 
financial crisis, for example – can have different repercussions for banknote circulation 
in different countries. This is true of the timeframe, magnitude, and sign of a possible 
response, but it also applies to the question of whether they have any effect on the 
value of banknotes in circulation at all. Indeed, there are also examples of crises not 
having had any noticeable effect on banknote circulation. Second, crises can have an 
impact on both small and large-denomination banknotes in circulation. This is likely to 
be attributable to precautionary motives in the face of uncertainty, and in the case of 
large denominations, also in some instances to store-of-value motives due to risk 
considerations. Third, alongside temporary effects, it appears that crises also have 
lasting effects on banknotes in circulation in terms of value.
The descriptive approach chosen for this article does not permit these hypotheses 
to be verified or systematic relationships to be identified and quantified. 
Nonetheless, it can be concluded overall that demand for banknotes changed in an 
unusual way in the wake of a number of crises. For example, the circulation of both 
small and large-denomination banknotes rose sharply in 10 of the 16 countries 
considered here during . During the global financial crisis of 2008, the value of large-Y2K
denomination banknotes in circulation increased in eight countries. Over the course of 
the −19 pandemic, the annual growth rate of large and small-denomination COVID
banknotes in circulation changed significantly in 11 of the countries considered, while  71)

Demand for banknotes during crises: an international perspective
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 96this rate fell in some cases. This therefore suggests that crises can play a role in 
explaining developments in banknote demand.
Empirical analyses aside, it can be maintained that cash is the only means of 
payment that is largely independent of technical infrastructure, and can therefore 
be used for payment transactions in the event of power outages or technical 
disruptions, for example.  As a form of central bank money, cash is also a safe haven 
during turbulent times given its capacity as a default-proof store of value. Accordingly, 
cash can be expected to make a key contribution to the resilience of a society in the 
face of natural disasters or disruptions to technical infrastructure, for instance. 
However, in order to be able to fulfil this function even in times of crises, the 
acceptance and availability of cash must always be guaranteed – including during crisis-
free periods.  As part of the Eurosystem’s cash strategy, the Bundesbank is 
committed to ensuring that euro banknotes and coins remain widely available and 
generally accepted as a means of payment and store of value in the future, too. 72)

101German balance of 
payments in 2023

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 102In 2023, the German current account surplus increased by 1¾ percentage points to just 
shy of 6% of nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ). The main reason for the increase  
following the substantial decline in 2022 was that the goods balance recovered 
significantly as prices for imported commodities (especially natural gas and other 
energy imports) fell. On the other hand, the deficit in the German services account 
widened. This is likely to have been driven in part by catch-up effects relating to cross-
border travel. The tightening of monetary policy in Germany and abroad was reflected 
in higher investment income to a roughly equal extent on the asset and liability sides. 
The balance of primary and secondary income remained more or less unchanged. 
Aggregate net lending/net borrowing rose relative to GDP  in the reporting year. First, 
on the investment side, non-financial corporations’ inventories, which had been 
increased in the previous year for price and crisis-related reasons, returned to normal 
levels. Second, domestic saving increased again from the subdued level of the previous 
year as firms distributed fewer profits.  
Reflecting the higher current account balance, German net capital exports likewise 
went back up in 2023. In an environment of rising financing costs and geopolitical 
tensions, there was robust cross-border demand for interest-bearing securities and, 
until and into autumn, a pronounced reluctance to invest in shares and mutual fund 
shares that typically involve higher risks. The restraint also affected German foreign 
direct investment ( ). Both German outward  and inward  were distinctly lower FDI FDI FDI
than in the previous year. In other investment, Germany’s  claims fell TARGET
significantly as a result of the Eurosystem’s tighter monetary policy. For example, the 
more restrictive monetary policy also meant that reinvestments under the asset 
purchase programme ( ) were discontinued as of July 2023. In previous years, net APP
purchases under the monetary policy asset purchase programmes had been an 
important factor in Germany’s high  claims. Towards the end of the year, TARGET
inflation fell somewhat more sharply than expected. Market participants accordingly 
revised the short-term inflation outlook downwards, and the markets deemed it more 
likely that key interest rates would fall over the course of 2024. This was also reflected 
in falling longer-term capital market rates. With listed companies continuing to boast a 
robust earnings situation, demand for their shares resurged globally.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 1031 Current account
1.1 Underlying trends in the current account
The German current account surplus increased significantly in 2023.  It rose by €78½  
billion to €243 billion. The balance increased by 1¾ percentage points to just shy of 6% 
of nominal GDP . However, the increase only partially offset the decline in the current 
account balance in the previous year, during which energy prices had risen sharply. At 
the end of the year, too, the balance was below its peak in the years before the 
outbreak of the war in Ukraine and of the COVID − 19 pandemic.  
In 2023, a major driver of developments in the German current account was the 
significant recovery in the goods trade balance.  Prices for imported commodities 
(especially natural gas and other energy imports) fell, causing the terms of trade to 
improve. The deficit in the services account, however, widened markedly. The still-pent-
up cross-border travel probably played a role here. In addition, special revenue from 
vaccines was no longer being generated. The monetary policy reversal in Germany and

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 104abroad was reflected in higher investment income to a roughly equal extent on the 
asset and liability sides. The balance of primary and secondary income remained more 
or less unchanged.
Overall, the global setting was rather subdued in 2023 amidst weaker goods 
demand.  The global economy continued to recover from the effects of the − 19 COVID
pandemic and the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. The central banks’ 
tighter monetary policy contributed to the declining inflation rates in numerous 
countries. However, higher financing costs and the expiry and lifting of fiscal support 
measures constrained demand. According to estimates by the International Monetary 
Fund, global trade in goods and services increased only marginally in 2023 compared 
with the previous year. The euro appreciated significantly, and German price 
competitiveness declined accordingly. Global commodity prices, especially those for 
natural gas and other energy imports, fell in 2023 after having risen the previous year 
in the wake of the Ukraine war. On average, however, they remained well above the 
long-run average.
 
 


German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 105 
Germany’s foreign trade surplus rose considerably in 2023.  This was mainly because,  
as mentioned above, import prices fell whilst export prices remained largely 
unchanged. The German terms of trade improved by just under 9% on the year. In 
terms of volume, however, the balance barely changed, as imports and exports alike 
declined markedly.  
In regional terms, the current account surplus rose particularly vis-à-vis non-euro 
area countries, where it picked up by 1¼ percentage points to 2¾% of GDP . In 
particular, the surplus in the goods account was higher, while the larger deficit in the 
services account dampened the increase. On the other hand, the German current 
account surplus vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area rose by only ¼ percentage point to 
3¼% of . In this case, too, the goods surplus increased, in particular. GDP
In the year under review, aggregate net lending/net borrowing (i.e. the balance of 
saving and investment) relative to GDP  increased considerably, particularly on 
account of developments concerning non-financial corporations.  This was driven 
chiefly by the decline in gross investment over  and, in particular, the fact that GDP
inventories, which had increased in the previous year for price and crisis-related 
reasons, returned to normal levels. However, non-financial corporations’ other 
investment remained unchanged relative to . Housing investment also declined in GDP
the year under review. In 2023, domestic saving went back up from its subdued level of 
the previous year. It was particularly higher corporate saving that contributed to the 


German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 106increase in aggregate net lending/net borrowing. This was due, amongst other things, 
to smaller profit distributions. As regards capital transfers, the general government 
deficit fell because government assistance granted in the wake of the − 19 COVID
pandemic was phased out. The balance of non-financial corporations’ capital transfers 
contracted. However, this shift did not affect aggregate net lending/net borrowing. 
Compared with the pre-pandemic period, aggregate net lending/net borrowing relative 
to  was considerably lower in 2023. This is attributable primarily to general GDP
government posting a deficit, after having still recorded surpluses in the years before 
the pandemic.

In regional terms, revenue from non-euro area exports and from euro area exports 
alike fell.  German exporters recorded a marked and, in some cases, sharp decline in 
revenue from their exports to major sales markets in the euro area, other regions of 
Europe, and South and East Asia. Exports to China dropped off very sharply, with a 
decline in motor vehicle deliveries also playing a role. Exports to Russia once again fell 
quite considerably, not least as a result of  sanctions. However, not all exports fell EU
across the board. For example, sales to the United States grew slightly, supported by 

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 108buoyant  economic activity. Deliveries to the United Kingdom rose sharply, including US
those of motor vehicles. Exports to Ukraine expanded quite considerably. This was 
mainly due to deliveries of goods in connection with the war.
In terms of the product mix, price-adjusted exports fell broadly, but motor vehicle 
exports increased.  Exports of consumer goods recorded a sharp decline in price-
adjusted terms, with deliveries of pharmaceutical products falling particularly sharply. 
As the − 19 pandemic subsided, global demand for − 19 vaccines declined. COVID COVID
In addition, export goods such as fabricated metal products and, above all, chemical 
products saw considerable setbacks. Their energy-intensive production took a hit from 
the persistently high energy costs. In addition, exports of energy products such as 
electricity and gas fell very sharply.  There was also a lack of demand stimulus for 
traditional machinery and equipment, and deliveries of capital goods such as 
computers and communications technology fell significantly. By contrast, exports of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts expanded sharply on an annual average.  Only 
a moderate development was observed over the course of 2023, however.

a whole remained very small.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 109varied. Exports to the euro area and the United Kingdom rose considerably. Deliveries 
to the United States remained at the hugely elevated level of the previous year. By 
contrast, German exporters posted considerable declines in their business with China. 
In e-mobility, in particular, which is a growth industry, Chinese demand for motor 
vehicles was increasingly being covered by local production.
From a regional perspective, imports from non-euro area countries declined 
significantly more sharply than those from the euro area in nominal terms.  German 
importers were afforded relief not only by falling energy prices but also by significantly 
lower prices for intermediate goods. In terms of value, the losses in revenue sustained 
by non-euro area producers as a whole were nearly twice those of euro area suppliers. 
One factor was that imports from China fell sharply across the board.  In addition, 
imports from Russia, which consist largely of energy products and were feeling the 
effects of  sanctions, fell to very low levels. Moreover, imports of oil and natural gas, EU
most of which originate from third countries, became cheaper. In terms of value, 
deliveries from Norway fell considerably. Almost three-fifths of them are natural gas. 
This was driven by the decline in prices and also the lower volume of imported natural 
gas. By contrast, imports of crude oil and oil products from the  countries rose OPEC
sharply. In this case, the increase in quantities more than offset the decline in oil prices.
Imports fell in price-adjusted terms for a wide range of products, but imports of 
motor vehicles rose sharply.  Price-adjusted imports of consumer goods declined 
considerably. Imports of pharmaceutical products also contracted, with the decline in 
demand for − 19 vaccines an important driver. Given weak industrial activity in COVID
Germany, foreign manufacturers’ deliveries of important intermediate and capital 
goods such as metals and metal products, computers and communications technology 
and machinery shrank very significantly. Imports of electrical equipment declined 
markedly over the course of the year following an initial surge in 2022. After rising 
massively in the previous year, imports of chemical products fell markedly. In addition, 
imports of energy products receded significantly by volume. This is because energy 
consumption in Germany fell, which was associated mainly with weaker domestic 
economic output, especially in the energy-intensive sectors.  Considerably less natural 
gas was sourced from abroad.  In addition, imports of crude oil and bituminous coal 
dropped sharply. This was only partly offset by the considerable increase in imports of  5)

 8) 5 This was also due to a very expansionary temporary special effect concerning chemicals imports (lactames, an 
input used in the production of pharmaceuticals and plastics) in the previous year, which then abated again to 
a large extent.

reduction in natural gas consumption in Germany.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 110refined petroleum products and, in particular, electricity.  Imports of motor vehicles 
and motor vehicle parts rose very strongly. The bringing-forward of purchases played a 
role here. In the late summer, the government environmental bonus for the purchase 
of electric vehicles was restricted.
Merchanting trade and supplementary trade items dampened goods trade on 
balance.  The other components of trade in goods – which include the supplementary 
trade items, net goods exports in merchanting trade, and trade in non-monetary 
gold – mitigated the rise in the goods trade balance considerably on the whole.  On 
balance, the goods surplus increased by €101 billion to €227 billion. 8) 
 9) 
8 The increase in (net) electricity imports is likely to have been caused in part by the fact that domestic electricity 
production fell more sharply than consumption. One factor here, in turn, was that it was cheaper to import 
electricity than to generate it in Germany using fossil fuels, partly because the remaining three nuclear power 
plants in Germany had been shut down in April 2023, and that more nuclear power was available in France 
than in the previous year. See German Association of Energy and Water Industries (2023).
9 The decisive factor here was the shift in supplementary trade items to net expenditure of €14 billion from net 
receipts of €9½ billion in the previous year. The sharp decline in imports for contract manufacturing in 
Germany was a considerable factor. In addition, the c.i.f. charges for imports, amongst other things, declined; 
these comprise the costs of freight and insurance from the border of the supplier’s country to the German 
border. Moreover, net receipts from merchanting fell by €7 billion. This decline was associated in equal 
measure with lower revenue and higher expenditure. This was only partly offset by the fact that net 
expenditure on trade in non-monetary gold, amounting to €8 billion in the previous year, shifted to net 
revenue of €2½ billion.

The role of regional trade agreements in international 
trade flows
This analysis is based on a research paper by Nagengast and Yotov (2024).
Regional trade agreements ( RTAs ) have recently attracted increased attention.  
World trade has lost significant momentum since the outbreak of the 2008‑09 global 
financial crisis.  In recent years, protectionist measures such as tariffs and non-tariff 
barriers to trade have probably curbed international trade.  In addition, supply chain 
disruptions caused by the − 19 pandemic and potential geopolitical tensions have COVID
recently shifted attention towards the diversification of inputs.  In this context, 
regional free trade agreements could help to boost international trade, growth and 
employment. They could also make it easier for firms to diversify their trading partners. 
The European Union is therefore seeking to conclude a new generation of free trade 
agreements, especially with growth regions.
The impact of RTAs  on international trade flows is one of the most widely studied 
and controversial topics in the literature on international trade.  Empirical estimates 
of how  affect international trade flows are sometimes seen as unrealistically RTAs
small. When conventional estimation methods are applied to gravity models,  are RTAs
estimated to increase trade between their member states by one-fifth.  Moreover, 
several papers indicate significant differences in the impact of regional trade 
agreements; these can vary widely depending on the agreements.  A more recent 
strand of the econometric literature has shown that conventional estimators of two-
way fixed effects, however, may be severely biased if the effects of policy measures do  1)

A new estimation approach suggests that RTAs  have a significantly larger and 
longer-lasting effect on international trade flows.  This approach adapts the 
methods proposed by Wooldridge (2023) to the characteristics of gravity models and is

earlier episodes in which similar policy measures already yielded results – instead of with a situation in which 
no measures were taken whatsoever. As a result, the estimator corresponds to a weighted average of the 
actual treatment effects. It can thus be biased either upwards or downwards. The weights can even be 
negative. The overall effects estimator is therefore not guaranteed to have the same sign as the individual 
treatment effects. See Borusyak et al. (2024).

The analysis is based on trade data including domestic trade from the Structural Gravity Database of the 
World Trade Organization for the 1980‑2016 period, as well as data on free trade agreements from the 
Dynamic Gravity Dataset of the United States International Trade Commission. See Larch et al. (2019) and 
Gurevich and Herman (2018).  encompass all bilateral trade agreements, such as free trade agreements, RTAs
currency unions and economic integration agreements. This analysis assumes an “onset” of  three years RTAs
before their actual entry into force. This is because, when an  is announced, which is usually several years RTA
before it is actually implemented, a number of trade barriers begin to fall and/or some economic agents begin 
to adjust their behaviour in anticipation of the agreement. See Moser and Rose (2012) and Egger et al. (2022).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 113The new estimator also suggests that newer trade agreements from the 2000s 
onward have been less effective in boosting international trade than earlier 
agreements.  A breakdown of the average effect of trade agreements by date of 
conclusion shows that the effects were largest and mostly above average in the 1990s. 
There are a number of possible reasons for this. First, the trade agreements that were 
particularly natural in terms of geographical factors and existing cross-border value 
chains were already signed in the 1980s and 1990s. The economic potential of the more 
recent agreements signed in the 2000s was therefore smaller and more limited.  
Second, the first two decades of the 2000s were marked by significant economic crises, 
such as the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 and the global financial crisis. Third, 
the average applied most-favoured nation tariffs fell significantly over the sample 
period,  thereby leaving less scope for trade-enhancing effects of -related tariff RTA
reductions.
On balance, the effects of RTAs  based on analyses using the new estimator are 
significantly larger than previously assumed.  They therefore also offer a positive 
outlook for remaining pairs of countries without trade agreements, as illustrated by a 
scenario based on a further estimation in which all pairs of countries without a trade not affected by large differences in the impact of trade agreements.  10)  The results 
show that RTAs  increase trade between their member states by around 46%. This 
figure is more than twice as large as the result obtained using conventional methods.  11) 
The result is also stable with regard to a number of robustness checks.  12)  An event 
study variant of the conventional approach – that allows the effects over time to be 
analysed – also suggests that the positive effects of RTAs  are exhausted relatively 
quickly, i.e. after around six years. By contrast, results obtained using the new 
estimation approach show that the effects of RTAs  grow relatively evenly over the years 
and are still perceptible more than 15 years after these agreements have been signed.  
 13) 
 14) 
 15) 
 16) 10 The new estimator takes into account varying effects at the cohort-year level and thus excludes “forbidden 
comparisons” with pairs of countries in which policy measures have already yielded results. The characteristics 
of gravity models are taken into account through the use of the non-linear Poisson pseudo maximum 
likelihood ( PPML ) estimator and the fixed effects structure that is standard in the literature.
11 A calculation of the implied weights of the conventional estimator using the method presented in de 
Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2020) suggests that it is biased downward compared to the new estimator 
since it puts larger weights on short-run effects and the effects of recent agreements, both of which tend to be 
smaller.
12 For details, see Nagengast and Yotov (2024).
13 We reach this finding even though  have become deeper and more comprehensive over time. Empirical RTAs
results for this analysis show that deeper trade agreements lead to more trade than shallower trade 
agreements (see, inter alia, Osnago et al. (2019) and Larch and Yotov (2023)). However, this effect is 
overshadowed by other factors that lead to trade agreements having a smaller impact over time.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 114agreement sign one.  The results provide preliminary indications that trade 
agreements between remaining pairs of countries would significantly boost trade, 
albeit to a lesser extent than the historical average. Looking ahead, the results thus 
provide an encouraging message that additional trade agreements, particularly ones 
that are deeper and more comprehensive, may further enhance international trade and 
make an important contribution to the diversification of suppliers and customers. 16) 
 17) 
16 To this end, the differences in the impact of trade agreements are first explained using bilateral 
determinants – such as geographical distance, common language, colonial ties and tariffs – as well as country-
specific determinants such as market size (see, inter alia, de Chaisemartin and (2022), Shahn (2023) D’Haultfœuille 
and Baier et al. (2019)). These results are then used in a partial model framework to calculate the 
counterfactual scenario in a back-of-the-envelope manner. It should be noted, however, that the 
counterfactual scenario does not take into account general equilibrium effects such as trade diversion. These 
probably to tend to weaken the partial equilibrium results.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 1151.3 Invisible current transactions
In 2023, the deficit in the cross-border services account increased considerably on 
the year to €63 billion.  That is the largest deficit in this account in more than two 
decades. Both lower receipts and higher expenditure contributed to this result. Exports 
of services declined slightly by ½% to €407 billion, after having risen markedly in the 
two preceding years. The primary reason for the decline was the disappearance of two 
special effects from the previous year. First, German transport freight rates fell from 
their exceptionally high level in 2022. Second, some intellectual property revenue in the 
pharmaceutical sector was eliminated. Services imports grew by just over 5% to €470 
billion, having already surged in the two preceding years. It was particularly cross-  
border travel expenditure which increased. However, expenditure in other services 
sectors was also up, in some cases significantly. This was only partly counteracted by a 
fall in German contractors' expenditure on goods transport services provided by 
foreign vendors.  
The travel account made by far the largest contribution to the high deficit in the 
services account.  At €69 billion in 2023, this sub-account once again posted the highest 
nominal deficit since records began. This represents an increase in the deficit by 
roughly €14 billion compared with 2022. Travel receipts – which Germany generates 
largely through travel for trade fairs, events and business trips – increased by around 
one-seventh. However, they continued to fall short of pre-pandemic levels. By contrast, 
the travel expenditure of German residents travelling abroad, which is characterised by 
holiday bookings, has already been above pre-pandemic levels since 2022. In 2023, it 
increased again by more than one-fifth to €103½ billion. These funds are now being 
channelled to a greater extent than before the pandemic to other  countries, while EU
spending on long-distance travel, especially to Asia, has not yet recovered to the same 
extent.
In 2023, cross-border transport services represented a substantial sub-item in the 
services account in terms of turnover.  Following massive increases in freight rates, in 
particular, in 2021 and 2022, prices went back down in the reporting year. However, 
given weakness in foreign trade, volume effects may also have played a dampening 
role. Residents’ receipts from transport services – which includes not only German 
transport companies’ proceeds from sea, land and air transport but also the operation 
of pipelines and electricity transmission – as well as domestic expenditure on transport 
services both fell by one-sixth. Compared with the previous year, the deficit in this area 
fell marginally by €1½ billion. Other components of the services account related to the 
goods trade – manufacturing, maintenance and repair services – posted a slightly 
reduced surplus.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 116In 2023, the surplus in the item “Charges for the use of intellectual property” 
decreased by €8 billion compared with the previous year.  The main reason for this 
development was the disappearance of the high revenues associated with the 
development of vaccines, which had led to high one-off revenues in 2021 and 2022.
In the year under review, turnover in other knowledge-based and business services 
rose distinctly.  The sub-account for cross-border telecommunications, computer and 
information services continued to post a deficit similar to that of the previous year. By 
contrast, the account for other business services, which include research and 
development, professional, technical and commercial services, as well as management 
consultancy services, contracted markedly by €4 billion. This was mainly due to 
increased expenditure on research and development abroad. The balance in cross-
border insurance, pension and financial services barely increased.
In the reporting year, the primary income balance recorded a massive and virtually 
unchanged surplus of €144 billion.  The surplus was only around €2 billion higher than 
in 2022, after having risen sharply in the two preceding years. As a result, net primary 
income alone represented some 3½% of . GDP
The high primary income balance is primarily the result of net investment income.  
Payments by residents to foreign investors rose substantially on the year. Owing to the 
considerable net external assets of German residents, domestic investors’ and lenders' 
income from cross-border investment far exceeded their expenditure. Income 


German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 117increased significantly on the year. On both sides of the balance sheet, this increase is 
mainly attributable to the higher level of interest rates.
The deficit in the cross-border secondary income account, which had grown in 
recent years, shrank slightly in 2023. In the reporting year, expenditure exceeded 
revenue by €65½ billion, or by €1½ billion less than a year earlier. Both revenue (+€6½ 
billion) and expenditure (+€5 billion) increased moderately. With the balance having 
changed little, it was primarily non-government cross-border secondary income which 
saw turnover growth. The underlying payment flows are predominantly insurance 
premiums or insurance claims adjustments by internationally active insurance 
companies. By contrast, remittance amounts remained stable. Aggregate government 
payment flows remained at the same level as in the previous year. On the revenue side, 
this relates, among other things, to taxes on income and wealth generated in Germany 
by non-residents. On the expenditure side, expenditure on Germany’s contributions to 
the  budget, which are measured in terms of gross national income, fell. However, EU
other payments relating to international cooperation, such as government assistance 
to Ukraine, largely offset this decline.

Current account balances: determinants over time and 
between countries
As part of the balance of payments, the current account is primarily a record of a 
country’s economic transactions with the rest of the world.  The current account 
balance is influenced by numerous factors, some of which are structural, and others 
cyclical in nature. What is always relevant to the current account balance is how 
domestic factors perform relative to those abroad. Structural factors include, for 
example, the energy intensity of an economy or demographics; they are typically long-
term in nature. Cyclical factors change continuously and show, for instance, whether a 
country’s domestic economy is performing better or worse than that of other countries.
The analysis presented here focuses on the factors influencing the current account 
balance via savings and investment behaviour domestically and abroad.  The current 
account balances are estimated using domestic and foreign variables over time that 
have an important influence on savings and investment behaviour. A panel regression 
with correlated random effects ( ) is used for the estimation. This estimation method CRE
allows for the simultaneous, yet separate, analysis of a panel’s time series and cross-
sectional variation.
The selection of variables used in this approach is based on the IMF’s estimations of 
current account balances as part of its External Balance Assessment.  Disparities 
arise, inter alia, from the fact that the , in accordance with its mandate, also IMF
includes many emerging market economies in its analyses. Only advanced economies  1)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 120are included in the panel used in the estimation presented here.  The approach draws 
on annual data from a total of 24 countries. The period covers the years from 1999 to 
2022. Unless stated otherwise, all variables enter the estimation as differences to the 
global average.  This ensures that any developments that are common to all countries 
have no effect on the estimated current account balances.
The explanatory variable is the current account ratio, defined as the current 
account balance in relation to nominal GDP . Standardisation using  facilitates a GDP
comparison across countries and over time. Given that – with the exception of statistical 
discrepancies – on aggregate the national current account balances must be balanced 
worldwide, this variable is not defined as a difference to the global average.  The 
variables described below serve as regressors.
The net external position in relation to GDP : a high net external asset position tends 
to generate higher investment income, which is a component of the current account 
balance. Consequently, in and of themselves, higher net external positions are likely to 
have a positive effect on current account balances. However, a higher asset position 
also enables increased consumption, which then promotes a lower current account 
balance. The previous year-end figure is applied to show the effect on net investment 
income. Differences to the global average are not calculated here for the same reasons 
that apply to the current account balance.
Energy balance in relation to GDP : as trade in energy sources is recorded in the trade 
balance, the energy balance is included directly in the current account balance. 
However, the correlation does not necessarily translate one-to-one due to second-
round effects. Therefore, the energy balance is not simply deducted from the current 
account balance (this would be equivalent to restricting the relevant coefficient to one); 
rather, its effect on the current account balance is estimated without restrictions. 
However, a positive sign is to be expected. It is not necessary to calculate a difference 
to the world average. 3)

Prospects, data on the export and import of energy sources from the International Energy Agency, and the 
share of the top 10% of national income from the World Inequality Database. The current account balance for 
Germany is calculated by the Bundesbank and Germany’s GDP  is calculated by the Federal Statistical Office.  
6 However, because the estimation uses current account balances in relation to  and the sample does not GDP
cover every country, the variable’s annual average is different from zero. Time-specific fixed effects take this 
fact into account in the panel estimation.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 121Real economic growth  contains a demand and a supply component. For demand-
related reasons, higher consumption and investment demand is more likely to have a 
negative effect on the current account balance. This effect correlates strongly with the 
“utilisation rate” and “lending” control variables described below. On the supply side, 
rising output is likely to go hand in hand with growth in exports, which would give rise 
to the expectation of a positive effect on the current account balance. However, a high 
level of international competitiveness, for instance, not only benefits the domestic 
economy’s exports, but also its local investment activity, meaning that the net effect on 
the current account balance is not clearly defined a priori.
The economy’s utilisation rate:  the percentage deviation of actual real  from GDP
potential output is a typical cyclical variable. It takes account of the observation that in 
an economic upturn, economies tend to have current account deficits as a result of 
increased domestic demand.
Lending to the private sector in relation to GDP  provides information on domestic 
consumption and investment demand. It is also strongly cyclical and is often 
responsible for the emergence of financial and macroeconomic imbalances, especially 
if the economy overheats.  Viewed from this perspective, a negative sign is to be 
expected as an effect on the current account balance over time.
Net lending/borrowing by general government in relation to GDP  represents 
government savings less public investment and therefore indicates the contribution 
made by general government to a country’s current account balance. Like the energy 
balance, it is directly included in the current account balance. Although the sign should 
therefore be positive, the coefficient may deviate from one due to second-round effects.
Percentage of primary savers in the labour force:  it is assumed that the population 
group aged between 45 and 64 typically saves more than the other age groups in the 
population. It is referred to here as the “primary savers” group. Therefore, a relatively  7)

The share of comparatively high incomes in an economy:  when the share of total 
national income accruing to the top 10% of incomes goes up, the current account 
balance is expected to increase as a direct result. The reason is that this segment of the 
population is more likely to utilise income gains for additional savings and wealth 
creation than for additional consumption.  9)

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 122high percentage of primary savers in the labour force is more likely to be associated 
with higher savings. With respect to the current account balance, a positive correlation 
is expected here.
However, the analysis not only considers the current share of primary savers, but 
also their average life expectancy . The higher the life expectancy is for this 
population group, the more they should save for old age. Viewed in isolation, this 
should increase the current account balance.
Conversely, the ratio of the population aged over 64 to the working age population  
expresses the relative significance of older people in relation to the labour force. Within 
the context of the current account estimation, a negative sign is expected for this 
variable because it is assumed that older people are at a stage in their lives when they 
are more likely to use up their savings (“dissave”) than to continue to accumulate 
additional assets.
Population growth  is used to approximate the influence exerted by other segments of 
the population in the economy that initially make no direct contribution to the 
accumulation of savings in a country. This makes it possible to capture the influence of 
population growth through births and migration. We would also expect a negative sign 
for this variable within the context of the current account estimation.
The following panel regression is estimated using a CRE approach:
where  is the current account ratio defined as the current account balance in 
 
relation to the nominal  of country   at time   and   is a vector containing k GDP

variation in a country’s data and are therefore referred to as “within group”; the 
estimated coefficients of the vector        reflect the effects of the cross-sectional 
variation in the data, are equivalent to a “between-effects” estimator and referred 
to as “between group”.  The two effects combined determine the result of the 
estimated current  10)

life expectancy of primary savers would be preferable from a methodological viewpoint, it is not available for 
all countries.

individual countries (“within group”) and between countries (“between group”) to be 
estimated simultaneously and separately. The approach is thus more general than the 
usual fixed-effects estimator.  Based on the estimation presented here, no normative 
statements are made as to whether the values for the current account balances 
determined in this way are appropriate or in equilibrium.

factors – have a negative effect. Among the demographic factors, population growth 
has the anticipated negative impact on the accumulation of savings. The share of the 
population of retirement age relative to the working population also influences the 
result, but, contrary to the assumption made, with a positive sign. It appears that older 
people in advanced economies often continue to accumulate assets instead of 
gradually using them up. The reasons for this may include uncertainty with regard to 
their own life expectancy or future nursing care needs, as well how the pension system 
is structured and a desire to leave assets to future generations.
 The within-group estimation demonstrates, for example, the relevance of the 
balance of trade in energy sources  with regard to the decline in the German current  
account balance in 2022 compared with the previous year. The panel approach 
yielded a significant positive coefficient of 0.008 for this variable. Germany’s current 
account balance in relation to GDP  was 4.2% in 2022, having stood at 7.3% the 
previous year. The deterioration in Germany’s balance of trade in energy sources had a 
particularly significant impact and (with an estimated coefficient of 0.008), when viewed 
in isolation, accounted for one percentage point (i.e. around one-third) of this decline.  
In the cross-country comparison – column 2, between-group coefficients – the 
country-specific average life expectancy of primary savers has the anticipated 
positive impact on the current account balance.  The cross-sectional view also 
confirms the positive contribution to savings made by the older population. Moreover,  13) 
13 All variables discussed here are statistically significant at a level of at least 5%.  

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 125in a cross-country comparison, external assets in the preceding period and net lending
/borrowing by general government also have a positive effect on the current account 
balance, while the utilisation rate has a dampening effect, as expected.
However, the cross-country comparison also shows that structural measures which, 
for example, strengthen competitiveness tend to have a positive effect on the 
current account balance.  This is indicated by the positive coefficient for economic 
growth. This effect was uncertain a priori, as a high level of international 
competitiveness not only benefits the domestic economy’s exports, but also local 
investment activity.
The CRE estimation method shows that differences between countries can play a 
significant role in explaining current account balances.  The estimation’s 
comparatively high R² (0.72) is due largely to the explanatory power of the “between” 
variation; the corresponding R² is 0.87. Consequently, it is higher than that of the 
“within” heterogeneity (0.44).
The model presented, which was estimated using the CRE approach, exhibits a 
comparatively high explanatory power for Germany’s current account ratio in 
recent years.  This applies both to the extended period of very high current account 
surpluses in relation to  and to the decline in 2022. GDP

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 1262 Capital movements
2.1 Underlying trends in capital movements
Germany’s net capital exports came to €232½ billion in 2023, which was significantly 
higher than in the previous year (€198 billion).  This rise was in line with the marked 
increase in the current account surplus, but was smaller in scale. As the third 
component of the balance of payments, the capital account closed with a deficit of 
€27½ billion. The capital account records capital transfers and transactions in non-
produced, non-financial assets, such as trading in emissions allowances or transactions 
in certain cryptocurrencies.  The remaining difference between the balance on the 
current account and the capital account and the balance on the financial account is 
attributable to statistical errors and omissions (€16½ billion).
 10) 
10 However, this only applies to cryptocurrencies which do not give rise to a liability of a counterparty. These are 
classified as financial instruments and recorded as capital movements in the financial account.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 127The tight monetary policy with which central banks responded to high inflation led 
to rising financing costs for enterprises on the global financial markets into the 
autumn.  At the beginning of the year, the financial markets temporarily experienced 
strong tensions, as some credit institutions in the United States and Europe came 
under pressure from rising interest rates. The tensions in the banking sector, however, 
were institution-specific and did not have any wider repercussions.
Towards the end of the year, inflation developments were unexpectedly favourable, 
increasing the likelihood that key interest rates would fall over the course of 2024. 
In the United States, robust economic data boosted confidence that the economy could 
achieve a soft landing in the event of declining inflation. This outlook increased 
investors' risk appetite and was reflected, among other things, in rising stock prices 
worldwide.
The more restrictive monetary policy had an impact on German portfolio 
investment throughout the year. First, interest rates rose, making interest-bearing 
securities more attractive again. Second, the Eurosystem discontinued reinvestments 
under the  in the course of 2023. In the past, the Eurosystem’s net monetary policy APP
purchases had played a major part in the declining volume of European debt securities 
held abroad. Under the changed monetary conditions, German investors added 
significantly more securities from other euro area countries to their portfolios in 2023 
than in previous years. Conversely, German debt securities likewise attracted lively 
interest abroad again. Gross portfolio investment flows in the German balance of 
payments came to €47 trillion, which was around the same amount as in the previous 
two years. After 2020, flows had increased rapidly after the United Kingdom left the 
European Union and a number of banks shifted their intra-group business.  This 
process now appears to be complete, at least with regard to trading activities.
Germany’s direct investment flows fell dramatically in the face of the multiple 
challenges described above.  This affected both inflows and outflows. Running counter 
to this trend, however, German direct investment flows to China remained quite high. 
This is all the more noteworthy given that heavy dependence on China is viewed 
critically in the economic policy debate, and that other Western countries tended to 
reduce their investment in China. However, it is important to bear in mind that the bulk 
of Germany’s direct investment flowed to other European countries last year.
On balance, Germany’s higher net capital exports were reflected in other 
investment.  The increase in the claims of enterprises and households in the form of 
deposits with foreign credit institutions and cash was a particularly striking  11) 
11 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022).

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 128development. This finding is indicative of low risk appetite among market participants, 
which prevailed for much of 2023. By contrast, the Bundesbank’s net external position 
in other investment declined. This was due to lower  claims on the  TARGET ECB
compared with the previous year. These fell as a result of the tighter monetary policy 
stance and the resulting decrease in excess liquidity in the Eurosystem.
2.2 Portfolio investment
For Germany’s cross-border portfolio investment, these factors resulted in only low 
net capital exports of €1 billion in 2023, compared with €10½ billion in the previous 
year.  However, this figure masks a significant increase in cross-border purchases and 
sales of securities, marked by a lively trade in long-term debt securities.
German investors purchased €149½ billion in foreign securities, of which €131 
billion was accounted for by debt securities.  Their main focus was on bonds (€122 
billion), primarily from other euro area countries. The popularity of these longer-dated 
debt securities was due to their increased attractiveness in view of the comparatively As outlined above, monetary policy in the major economies had a key influence on 
portfolio investment over the course of the year.  In addition, divergent economic 
prospects for the major currency areas affected events on the financial markets in 
general. In the first three quarters of 2023, inflation rates on both sides of the Atlantic 
were surprisingly persistent. In the United States, the Fed raised the lower bound on 
the target range for the federal funds rate from 4.25% to 5.25%, implementing its final 
interest rate hike to date on 27 July 2023. The Eurosystem also raised its key interest 
rates, increasing them by a total of two percentage points in six interest rate steps up 
to the end of September. This tightening of the monetary policy reins beginning in July 
2022 was the sharpest in the euro’s history. The deposit facility rate has been at 4% 
since 20 September 2023.  12)  The Eurosystem also increased the degree of monetary 
policy restriction by gradually phasing out reinvestment under the APP by the end of 
June. In combination with investors’ low risk appetite, these measures resulted in rising 
financing costs for enterprises in Germany and the rest of the world. In the final 
quarter of 2023, inflation developments were unexpectedly favourable, which raised 
expectations that key interest rates would fall faster over the course of 2024 than 
previously expected. This confidence, combined with positive economic data from the 
United States and robust profitability, drove up stock market indices worldwide.  
 13) 12 In the current landscape of structural excess liquidity in the euro area, the deposit facility rate is the key lever 
in monetary policy steering.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 129high interest rates.  In addition, the Eurosystem no longer fully replaced maturing 
debt securities from its  portfolio with newly acquired securities, and even APP
discontinued these reinvestments altogether in July 2023.  Among others, 
commercial banks stepped in to replace the Eurosystem as holders of public debt 
instruments.  In addition, there were substantial new issuances of securities by the 
European Commission and some euro area countries. In keeping with this, German 
investors also made significant purchases of public bonds from the European 
Commission (€13½ billion), France (€9 billion) and Italy (€6 billion). Among non-
European securities,  government bonds were particularly in demand (€6½ billion). US
Debt securities with a maturity of up to one year were also purchased (for €9  billion ½
net), but they saw less benefit from the high interest rates than long-dated securities. 
Demand for other assets was subdued. German investors placed only €23½ billion net 
in foreign mutual fund shares, while, for shares, sales actually outweighed purchases 
on balance (€5½ billion). This mainly affected equities from the United States and 
Ireland (€8½ billion each). Investors seem to have had disproportionately small bond 
holdings during the period of low interest rates and were now using rising yields to tilt 
their portfolios more towards interest-bearing securities. 13) 
 14) 
 15) 
13 Around 87% of these purchases were made in the first half of the year, when interest rates rose sharply.  
14 See European Central Bank (2023a, 2023b). Net purchases under the APP had been discontinued with effect 
from 1 July 2022. See European Central Bank (2022). Net asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency 
Purchase Programme ( ) had already been discontinued at the end of March 2022. See European Central Bank PEPP
(2021).
15 As a consequence, domestic and foreign government debt securities could increasingly be held on the 
balance sheets of private credit institutions again in future. This applies not just to Germany, but also to other 
euro area countries.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 130Conversely, foreign investors purchased German securities worth €148 billion net, 
likewise primarily debt securities. Demand was greatest for public bonds (€120½ 
billion). This was more than the total net issuance of government bonds in 2023 (€82 
billion). It appears that, with the phase of low interest rates coming to an end, there 
was substantial pent-up demand for German securities among international investors. 
Private bonds accounted for a further €39 billion, with demand for bank bonds, above 
all, starting in the middle of the year. The uncertainty surrounding the banking sector 
following the crisis affecting regional banks in the United States and the distress 
suffered by a major Swiss bank at the beginning of the year left no lasting mark in this 
area. However, the general interest in interest-bearing securities did not carry over to 
short-term securities. Net purchases of this instrument by foreign investors totalled a 
moderate €4 billion over the course of the year. For the most part, foreign investors 
shed German shares (€13 billion) and mutual fund shares (€2 billion) from their 
portfolios, shifting to net purchases of bonds – this, too, was a mirror image of German 
market participants’ behaviour.
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to form a single item in the balance of 
payments) recorded net capital exports of a similar size to the previous year . They 
amounted to €40 billion, compared with €41½ billion in the previous 12-month period. 
Options trades were the main factor contributing to the outflow of funds. They account 
 16) 

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 131for just over one-half of the total balance of derivatives.  Forward transactions also 
remained relevant. Forward and futures contracts relating to gas, however, fell by just 
under one-half compared with 2022, when they had gained considerably in importance 
following the Russian attack on Ukraine in February of that year.

2.3 Direct investment
In 2023, enterprises operating internationally were confronted with uncertainties 
and challenges, which dampened cross-border direct investment.  Although growth  
prospects developed differently in individual regions of the world, they were subdued 
in many countries. High inflation and rising interest rates across major currency areas 
shaped the economic environment. Geopolitical conflicts, sanctions and, in some cases, 
additional requirements  17)  for cross-border business activities affected corporate 
decisions. In this environment, cross-border direct investment remained weak 
worldwide in 2023. According to initial preliminary data from the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ), global direct investment increased 
by 3% in 2023 compared with the previous year.  18)  However, UNCTAD  suggests that 
this growth was mainly driven by transactions in a few European countries (such as 
Luxembourg and the Netherlands), which often tend to hold a pass-through function 
for cross-border investment.  19)  Excluding these transactions from the overall 
development, the reported global direct investment flows would be around 18% lower 
in 2023 than in 2022. Countries in the European Union, excluding Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands, likewise recorded significantly lower direct investment inflows (by 23%) 
than in 2022. According to UNCTAD  data, foreign direct investment ( FDI) in North 
America stagnated, whilst in other advanced economies and developing countries it 
was likewise down on the year in 2023. Preliminary UNCTAD  data suggest that the 
volume of cross-border mergers and acquisitions worldwide remained significantly 
17 These include, for example, local content requirements for parts of the value added or local certification 
regulations.

19 This is due to the activities of corporations located there and specialised in the pass-through of funds.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 133below the previous year’s level. Furthermore, according to this source, there were 
fewer announcements about international project finance deals and greenfield 
investment activity in 2023.
A similar picture was presented for cross-border investment projects by German 
enterprises operating internationally in 2023.  According to the German Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry ( ), the share of German industrial enterprises planning to DIHK
invest abroad at the beginning of 2023 was noticeably lower than the average of the 
previous ten years.  In 2023, the cost savings motive for foreign investment had 
gained importance again. Overall, German enterprises had modest expectations with 
regard to economic activity abroad in 2023, with differences across locations.
In the difficult economic environment, cross-border FDI flows to and from Germany 
led to net capital exports of €59½ billion in 2023.  German  was significantly more FDI
subdued last year than in 2022. There was an even sharper decline in  flows to FDI
Germany compared with the previous year. Direct investment is generally longer-term 
in nature.  On the one hand, in a rapidly changing economic environment, it provides 
enterprises with an important tool to adapt to change. On the other hand, direct 
investment also poses particular challenges for enterprises, as management cannot 
easily change decisions at a later point, or at least not without considerable costs.
German FDI amounted to €74½ billion in 2023, which was down noticeably on the 
previous year.  In 2022, German FDI amounted to €170 ½ billion, which was quite high  
in historical terms. In the past year, equity investments accounted for almost 85% of 
German direct investment (€62 ½ billion) on balance, with the majority of this figure 
taking the form of reinvested earnings (€46 billion). This meant that reinvested 
earnings again played a greater role last year than equity capital in the narrower sense, 
which is determined as the balance of new investment and liquidation in direct 
investment. Cross-border corporate takeovers by firms based in Germany played a 
significant role in 2023. Despite the subdued global trend in this area, corporate 
takeovers by German enterprises were up significantly in a year-on-year comparison  20)

22 Adjustments are therefore more likely to take place over the longer term. Nevertheless, shorter-term 
arrangements between affiliated enterprises also affect cross-border direct investment flows. For example, 
this may be the case when an entity in one country provides certain cross-border financial services to entities 
in other countries.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 134and in terms of volume, while the number of transactions declined somewhat.  
German-based firms provided affiliated enterprises abroad with €12 billion via intra-
group lending. Financial loans were provided both to subsidiaries and affiliates abroad 
and from subsidiaries domiciled in Germany to their foreign parent companies. By 
contrast, intra-group trade credits to affiliated enterprises abroad were mainly 
redeemed.
Europe was by far the most popular destination for German direct investment last 
year.  Of the €74  billion net invested in affiliates abroad, around two-thirds flowed into ½
other countries within the European Union. Luxembourg, which is an important 
holding company location, attracted particularly large amounts (€13  billion). ½
Enterprises domiciled in Germany also sharply stepped up their direct investment in 
France (€7 billion), Belgium (€5  billion) and Austria, Spain and Denmark (€5 billion ½
each). Among European countries outside the European Union, the United Kingdom 
was once again an important destination for intra-group funding (€19 billion). Lending 
dominated, but firms domiciled in Germany also stepped up their equity capital in 
affiliated enterprises in the United Kingdom.
In 2023, direct investment outside Europe was strongly affected by fund flows 
moving in opposite directions. In the case of China and the United States, this was not 
in line with assessments of the economic outlook in the two countries: in China, 
German-based enterprises engaged in relatively large  (€6  billion) last year. FDI ½
Reinvestment of earnings generated there played a key role. By contrast, direct 
investment relationships with the United States saw larger return flows of funds to 
Germany (€18 billion). However, this sharp decline in direct investment in the United 
States last year does not reflect the assessment of German enterprises operating there 
of their business prospects in the country. This was quite positive and also more 
favourable than in some other regions.  By contrast, direct investment in China 
increased even though the macroeconomic outlook there is more muted.  The 
change in sentiment could therefore also be reflected in direct investment actually 
recorded in the next few years. 24) 
 25) 
 26) 
24 Takeovers of firms domiciled abroad and previously under foreign ownership – and a German stake of at least 
10 % after the transaction – accounted for around €24 billion in 2023; this was significantly more than in 2022, 
when the value of the takeovers was reported at around €12½ billion (data based on  Workspace, data LSEG
extracted as at 23 February 2024). The time at which mergers and acquisitions are captured in the balance of 
payments can, however, differ from that recorded by  Workspace, meaning that the reported figures are not LSEG
directly comparable.

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 135Foreign enterprises provided affiliated enterprises in Germany with funds totalling 
€15 billion net last year, which was only around one-quarter of the amount recorded 
in the previous year (€58 billion).  Inward  into Germany thus declined for the third FDI
year in succession. It is not yet possible to pinpoint the extent to which this 
development reflects more recent cyclical influences or also longer-term structural 
factors relating to Germany as a business location.  As described above,  data for FDI
many regions and countries indicated global restraint last year, as is likely to have also 
been reflected in inward  into Germany. In the ten years between 2013 and 2022, FDI FDI
in Germany totalled €78 billion on an annual average and only once was below the 
2023 figure – €14 billion in 2014. At that time, the decline was largely influenced by the 
transaction of a foreign enterprise which had withdrawn large amounts of intra-group 
lending. By contrast, in 2023 it was not possible to discern any single transaction which 
dominated the result.
By augmenting their equity capital, foreign enterprises provided affiliated 
companies in Germany with €25 billion, predominantly through equity capital in the 
narrower sense.  With regard to credit transactions, redemptions outweighed, on 
balance, the granting of new loans (€10 billion). In particular, domestic parent 
 27) 
27 See, for example, Deutsche Bundesbank (2023a).

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 136companies redeemed financial loans they had previously received from foreign 
subsidiaries. By contrast, domestic subsidiaries and affiliates received additional funds 
from abroad through intra-group lending and, in turn, redeemed some of their existing 
long-term financial loans. Cross-border trade credits were also dominated by 
repayments.
In particular, enterprises domiciled in other European countries provided direct 
investment funds to German firms last year.  Affiliated enterprises from the United 
Kingdom made particularly substantial direct investments (€38  billion), mainly via ½
intra-group credit transactions. Belgium (€7 billion), Switzerland (€6 billion), Sweden (€4 
billion) and France (€3 billion) were also the sources of larger inflows to Germany. 
However, return flows of funds predominated in the euro area countries (€32  billion),  ½
mainly due to the cross-border repayment of previously drawn loans. The Netherlands 
(€29  billion) and Ireland (€10 billion) observed particularly significant return flows.  ½
Outside Europe, particularly the United States recorded higher return flows of funds 
(€7½ billion). The fact that German-based enterprises redeemed loans previously 
granted by affiliated enterprises had a bearing here, too.
2.4 Other investment
Other investment recorded net capital exports of €131 billion in 2023. It comprises 
loans and trade credits (where these do not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other investment. In 2022, other investment had given rise to net 
capital exports of €29  billion. The balances of other investment often see ½
volatility – including changes in sign. Last year, the higher net capital exports were due 
to a sharp decline in external liabilities of €135½ billion, while claims decreased by €5 
billion.
Transactions via the accounts of monetary financial institutions (excluding the 
Bundesbank) and by enterprises and households, as well as government, led to net 
capital exports last year.  Net capital exports via the accounts of monetary financial 
institutions (excluding the Bundesbank) amounted to €97½ billion. Claims arising from 
cash and deposits as well as from loans were up on the previous year. In the opposite 
direction, foreign institutions reduced deposits with German institutions, with group-
affiliated institutions, in particular, scaling back their cross-border deposits in Germany. 
This might reflect a decline in excess liquidity within the euro area. In 2023, the cross-
border activities of enterprises and households in other investment (€60 billion) 
likewise resulted in net capital exports. They significantly expanded their claims against 

German balance of payments in 2023
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 137foreign institutions arising from cash and deposits, while their liabilities to non-
residents arising from loans also increased. Transactions by general government 
resulted in net external claims of €7½ billion in 2023.
By contrast, Bundesbank accounts recorded net capital imports of €34 billion.  The 
Bundesbank’s claims fell significantly in 2023, mainly as a result of the decline in TARGET
claims by €175½ billion. This was due, among other things, to the fact that maturing 
securities from the  portfolio were no longer being reinvested in full. Reinvestments APP
under the  have been discontinued altogether since July 2023. It was therefore APP
investors based outside the issuing country who invested more heavily in new issuance 
of national and supranational bonds from issuers located in the euro area (see Chapter 
2.2 Portfolio investment). Germany’s  balance is reduced if these purchases are TARGET
settled in Frankfurt. The purchase phase in which  claims were built up mirrored TARGET
this development.  The Bundesbank’s liabilities also fell on the year, mainly as a result 
of lower deposits from counterparties domiciled outside of the euro area. Although 
these deposits rose at the end of the year – as has often been the case in recent 
years – they declined overall over the course of the year. The Bundesbank’s liabilities 
arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem went up by €25 
billion compared with 2022.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2024 1382.5 Reserve assets
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets rose by €1 billion in 2023 on account of 
transactions.  On balance, this was mainly due to an increase in special drawing rights, 
which were exchanged for euro.
The international reserve holdings are also influenced by balance sheet 
adjustments which, in compliance with internationally agreed accounting 
standards, are not recognised in the balance of payments.  The end-of-year 
revaluation of the reserve assets resulted in an increase of around €15 billion in 2023. 
This was due to an increase in gold prices compared to the previous year, whilst other 
non-transaction-related changes, including exchange rate effects, had a dampening 
impact. On the reporting date of 31 December 2023, the value of Germany’s reserve 
assets stood at €292½ billion.

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

an agreed maturity and all loans excluding revolving loans and overdrafts, credit card

ures based on the quarterly figures of the Federal Statistical Office, core budgets and
off-budget entities which are assigned to the general government sector.  2 The annual
figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state
and local government.  5 On the revenue side, this contains proceeds booked as dis-
posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.

publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
