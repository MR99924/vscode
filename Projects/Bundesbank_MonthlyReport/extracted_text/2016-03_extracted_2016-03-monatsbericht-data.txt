Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy made a very buoyant 
start to 2016. The sound pace of growth in the 
second half of 2015, which, at a quarterly rate 
of 0.3%, was roughly in line with potential 
growth, is likely to have been at least main -
tained or possibly even slightly exceeded in the 
first quarter of 2016. Given continued buoyant 
consumption activity, there was a sharp boost 
from industry and the construction sector, 
which benefited from special factors in January. 
Industrial production rose sharply according to 
the preliminary data provided by the Federal 
Statistical Office, with strong growth in the 
level of activity also being reported for the con -
struction sector. By contrast, no additional 
stimulus came from exports. For the second 
quarter of 2016, however, there are signs of a 
reduction in the pace of economic growth. This 
is shown not only by stagnating new orders 
received  by industry but also by the further 
deterioration  in business expectations in the Ifo 
business climate index. This was, moreover, 
accompanied  by a clear decline in output and 
export expectations, which had previously been 
stable and expansionary. By contrast, consumer 
sentiment has remained very positive.
Industry
After seasonal adjustment, industrial output 
showed a very sharp 3¼% rise in January com -
pared with December, which had undergone 
substantial upward revision. In seasonally ad -
justed terms, this was 3% more than the aver -
age level of the fourth quarter of 2015. This 
extremely strong growth could have been bol -
stered by two special factors: some sectors saw 
fairly large cutbacks in production due to holi -
days in December 2015, and January 2016 fea -
tured an exceptional calendar pattern with very few working days, which had occurred only 
twice in the past 20 years. This implies that the 
margins of uncertainty in the calendar- adjusted 
data are larger than usual. It is therefore diffi -
cult to make a meaningful economic assess -
ment without first looking at the output figure 
for February. Manufacturers of capital goods 
(+4½%) and consumer goods (+3¾%) in -
creased their production more than manufac -
turers of intermediate goods (+1½%).
The intake of new industrial orders in January 
was almost unchanged on the month after 
seasonal adjustment. It was thus slightly up by 
¼% on its level in the final quarter of 2015. 
While domestic orders were down significantly 
on the average of the fourth quarter (-1¾%), 
there was a sharp increase in demand from the 
euro area again (+2¾%) following a decline in 
the fourth quarter of 2015. A large part in this 
was played by the clearly higher volume of 
orders for other transport equipment, given 
that a comparatively small number of orders 
was received at the end of 2015. Excluding this 
sector, euro- area orders were down on the 
quarter (-¾%). A significant increase was also 
recorded in orders from non- euro- area coun -
tries (+1¼%). Looking at the individual sectors, 
there was a marked decline in orders of inter -
mediate goods (-4%). In contrast to this, orders 
of capital goods and, in particular, consumer 
goods saw a steep rise (+2% and +6% respect -
ively), driven mainly by strong external demand.
In January, industrial sales were up slightly by 
¾% on the month after seasonal adjustment 
and were thus clearly above their level in the 
fourth quarter of 2015 (+1¼%). This was due 
chiefly to a strong 2% increase in domestic 
business. By contrast, growth in sales abroad 
was clearly more moderate (+½%) and was 
even stagnating in non- euro- area countries. 
Seasonally adjusted nominal exports of goods 
in January declined slightly (-½%) on the month 
and were thus distinctly below their level in the Economic 
growth still sound at begin-ning of year

fourth quarter 2015 (-¾%). Falling export 
prices played a key role in this, however. This 
means that there was only a small decrease in 
price- adjusted terms (-¼%). At the same time, 
nominal goods imports showed a steep rise on 
the month (+1¼%). This was ½% up on the 
quarter in nominal terms; in price- adjusted 
terms there was substantial growth of +3¼%, 
mainly because of the sharp fall in commodity 
prices.
Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in 
January rose very sharply (+7%) on the month, 
with December having undergone slight down -
ward revision, and was well above the fourth 
quarter of 2015 (+6¾%). The exceptionally 
good result was essentially due to a sharp 
increase  in output in the finishing trades 
(+15¾%), although the data for this sector are 
generally subject to considerable revision. By 
contrast, the more reliable data on output in 
the main construction sector show a slight de -
cline (-1%), although this is largely due to the 
fact that weather conditions returned to nor -
mal compared with the mild December. This 
decline affected  civil engineering in particular, 
while building construction output was almost 
 unchanged. Orders in the main construction 
sector, which showed a significant seasonally 
adjusted quarter- on- quarter increase in the 
fourth quarter (+10¾%), indicate that the 
sharp pick- up in construction activity is likely to 
continue for an extended period.
Labour market
The existing strong employment growth accel -
erated further at the beginning of the year. In 
January, the seasonally adjusted number of 
persons in work in Germany went up by 74,000 
on the month, with the annual increase going 
up to 517,000, or 1.2%. Employment growth is 
being sustained mainly by the positive develop -
ment in jobs subject to social security contribu -Strong expansion

tions, the number of which showed an ex -
tremely sharp year- on- year increase of 780,000, 
or 2.6%, in December. According to the provi -
sional figures of the Federal Employment 
Agency, exclusively low- paid part- time employ -
ment showed a slight fall again at the end of 
2015, however, and was 4% down on its level 
in the same month of 2014. The downward 
trend in self- employment likewise continued. 
However, hiring intensity might ease off some -
what in the near future. This is shown in the Ifo 
employment barometer, which recently re -
corded a perceptible deterioration, particularly 
in the services sector, but is nevertheless still 
clearly expansionary overall. The Federal Em -
ployment Agency’s BA-  X job index remained 
unchanged at its high level.
Registered unemployment declined distinctly in 
February, as it had done in the preceding 
months. At the end of the period under review, 
there were 2.72 million persons registered with 
the Federal Employment Agency as un -
employed, which was 11,000 fewer than in the 
previous month. As in January, the employment 
rate stood at 6.2%, which was 0.3% percent -
age point down on the year. In February, the 
labour market barometer of the Institute for 
Employment Research (IAB) remained in neutral 
territory. Unemployment is therefore likely to 
remain largely unchanged at its low level over 
the next few months.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued to be characterised 
by marked price fluctuations in February, but 
were showing a clear tendency to rise from the 
middle of the month. Compared with the price 
levels in January, they were up by 6½% on 
average in US dollar terms, but were still just 
over two- fifths down on the year. Crude oil 
prices were continuing to rise in the first half of 
March. As this report went to press, the price 
of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$42½. 
The premium on crude oil futures was US$2¼ for deliveries six months ahead and US$4½ for 
deliveries 12 months ahead.
The ongoing fall in import and producer prices 
intensified at the beginning of the year. This 
was very largely attributable to declining energy  
prices, but other goods became markedly 
cheaper, too. The year- on- year decline widened 
in January to -3.8% in the case of imports. 
Taking  the two- month average of January and 
February, the rate in domestic sales fell to 
-2.7% and was thus slightly below the level in 
December 2015.
Consumer prices, in turn, contracted slightly by 
a seasonally adjusted -0.1% in February. Energy 
continued to become cheaper, even though 
the price decreases were no longer as large as 
in the previous months. Excluding energy, 
prices remained unchanged, however. Food 
products became slightly more expensive. 
Prices for industrial goods fell somewhat, not 
least owing to continuing seasonal sales of 
clothing and shoes. Although consumers had 
to pay significantly less for package holidays, 
prices of services remained constant overall. 
Housing rents went up moderately. The annual 
rate of consumer inflation was perceptibly 
down overall, one contributory factor being 
sharp price increases in February 2015. The 
annual  rate of consumer inflation was 0.0% 
according  to the national Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) compared with +0.5% in January. As 
measured by the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP), the rate turned negative 
and fell to -0.2% from +0.4%. Excluding en -
ergy, the annual CPI rate was +0.9% and the 
annual HICP rate was +0.8%. The figures for 
February were therefore somewhat below ex -
pectations. The deviations are, however, mainly 
related to temporary factors (price reductions 
for package holidays and clothing), for which a 
correction is expected later in the year. Never -
theless, based on the current path of forward 
quotations for crude oil, negative HICP inflation 
rates may be expected over the next few 
months as well.Further decline

Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
According to initial preliminary data, the statu -
tory health insurance (SHI) scheme recorded a 
deficit of €3½ billion in 2015, which constitutes 
a year- on- year increase of just over €1 billion. 
The health insurance institutions’ deficit re -
mained virtually unchanged at just over €1 bil -
lion. On balance, this had been expected as the 
individual additional contribution rates aver -
aged 0.83% and were thus below the figure of 
0.9% that the group of statutory health insur -
ance estimators had calculated as necessary to 
cover expenditure.2 The health fund’s deficit 
rose from just over €1 billion in 2014 to nearly 
€2½ billion. This had likewise been on the 
cards after central government cut its grant to 
provide relief for its budget by €2½ billion.3 
The health fund’s reserves thus shrank to €10 billion. The health insurance institutions’ finan -
cial reserves fell to €14½ billion overall.4
The health insurance institutions’ income rose 
significantly by 4%. A 4½% increase in trans -
fers from the health fund was set against a de -
cline in other revenue. At 4%, the health insur -
ance institutions’ expenditure rose at a dis -
tinctly slower pace than in 2014 (+5½%). Not 
least spending on pharmaceuticals plummeted. 
This had risen particularly steeply in 2014 as 
statutory manufacturers’ discounts had ex -
pired, whereas discounts negotiated between 
the institutions and pharmaceutical manufac -
turers continued to rise last year. Overall, how -
ever, there was still a 4½% increase (2014: 
+10%). At somewhat more than 4%, growth in 
expenditure on therapeutic treatment and aids 
was also significantly weaker than in the previ -
ous year (+8%). This was especially due to a 
very steep rise in payments for hearing aids at 
that time. Sickness benefit likewise experienced 
a slowdown. Nonetheless, the 6% increase 
was still above average (2014: +9%). By con -
trast, at just under 4%, the rise in spending on 
in- patient treatment – the main cost item – 
was slightly below average. In particular, the 
even weaker growth in expenditure on dental 
treatment and the decline in other expenditure

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 Up until 2014, members had to pay a uniform special 
contribution of 0.9%. Now, however, health insurance in -
stitutions can set individual additional contribution rates. 
Each autumn, the group of statutory health insurance esti -
mators calculates the average additional contribution rate 
that would be needed for the following year to cover the 
forecast expenditure of the health insurance institutions.
3 In line with the relevant legislation, the cuts in the central 
government grant – compared with the regular amount of 
€14 billion a year – between 2013 and 2015 were financed 
from the health fund’s reserves. In 2014, the grant was cut 
even more (by €3½ billion). However, income subject to 
compulsory insurance contributions – and, consequently, 
the deficit – developed more favourably than expected.
4 Each statutory health insurance institution, as well as the 
health fund, is required to hold minimum reserves of one- 
quarter of a month’s expenditure (sections 261 (2) and 271 
(2) of the Social Security Code Book V).Deutsche Bundesbank

€½ billion) no longer being allowed to be 
made following the changeover to individual 
additional contribution rates – had a dampen -
ing effect. A one- off increase in a health insur -
ance institution’s pension provisions contrib -
uted significantly to the marked rise in adminis -
tration costs by nearly 4%.
The health fund’s revenue increased by almost 
4% in 2015. Alongside the 3½% rise in contri -
bution receipts (including additional contribu -
tions), the fact that the cut in the central gov -
ernment grant was €1 billion smaller than in 
2014 had a positive impact. If the additional 
contribution rate had remained unchanged on 
average, the contributions would have in -
creased by just over 4%. For members in em -
ployment, this was attributable to the favour -
able employment and wage developments. In 
the case of the comparable rise in contributions 
for pensions, benefit increases – especially in 
the form of the full pension at the age of 63 
and higher mothers’ pensions – were also im -
portant factors. Given the predetermined pay -
ments to the health insurance institutions 
(+4½%), the deficit of the health fund was in 
line with the figure forecast by the group of 
statutory health insurance estimators in au -
tumn 2014.
An extensive reduction in the health fund’s def -
icit is on the cards for this year on account of 
the central government grant being returned 
to its standard level of €14 billion. At the begin -
ning of the year, the institutions’ average add -
itional contribution rate rose significantly to al -
most 1.1% and thus nearly reached the level 
that the group of statutory health insurance 
estimators calculated as necessary to cover ex -
penditure in 2016. As there are currently no 
signs of any major deviations from the esti -
mates made back then, it seems feasible for 
the SHI scheme to record at least a broadly bal -
anced result this year. In the medium term, it 
can be expected that the increase in spending 
on benefits will exceed growth in income sub -
ject to compulsory insurance contributions, not 
least on account of demographic changes. In the absence of further measures, this will result 
in sustained pressure for successive rises in the 
additional contribution rates, even if statutory 
benefit increases are waived.
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market 
picked up again considerably in January 2016. 
Overall, bonds worth €122.8 billion were is -
sued, compared with €67.2 billion in December 
2015. After deducting redemptions, which 
were lower than in the previous month, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own debt securities, however, the out -
standing volume of domestic bonds fell by €1.9 
billion. Foreign debt securities worth €9.5 bil -

ities in the German market in January amounted 
to €7.6 billion.
Credit institutions increased their capital mar -
ket debt in the reporting month by €7.5 billion 
net. On balance, this was attributable predom -
inantly to other bank debt securities which can 
be structured flexibly (€4.9 billion) and debt se -
curities issued by specialised credit institutions 
(€4.5 billion). By contrast, mortgage Pfand -
briefe  and public Pfandbriefe  were redeemed 
to the tune of, respectively, €1.5 billion and 
€0.4 billion net.
In January, domestic enterprises issued bonds 
worth €2.9 billion net, compared with €1.0 bil -
lion in the previous month. On balance, this 
new issuance activity primarily involved instru -
ments with a maturity of more than one year. 
In particular, non- financial corporations in -
creased their capital market debt (€1.9 billion).In the reporting month, the public sector re -
deemed own bonds worth €12.3 billion net 
(compared with net redemptions of €3.7 billion 
in December 2015). Central government, in 
particular, reduced its capital market debt (€9.2 
billion). In this context, it primarily redeemed 
ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €17.4 bil -
lion. This contrasted with net issuance of two- 
year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) worth 
€5.0 billion and 30-year bonds worth €1.1 bil -
lion. State governments redeemed bonds 
worth €3.0 billion net.
The Deutsche Bundesbank was the predomin -
ant buyer of debt securities on balance, adding 
€12.0 billion worth of bonds to its portfolio 
under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
grammes. This principally involved domestic 
public sector instruments. Foreign investors 
and German credit institutions acquired bonds 
worth €2.6 billion and €2.2 billion net, respect -
ively. By contrast, domestic non- banks sold 
debt securities worth €9.2 billion net.
Equity market
There was hardly any issuing activity in the Ger -
man equity market in January. Domestic com -
panies issued just €0.1 billion worth of shares 
overall. The outstanding volume of foreign 
shares in the German market shrank by €1.9 
billion over the same period. Equities were pur -
chased, on balance, exclusively by resident 
non- banks (€5.7 billion), which were interested 
primarily in domestic securities (€4.1 billion). By

subscriptions (€6.4 billion), as were, albeit to a 
lesser extent, bond funds (€3.7 billion), open-  
end real estate funds (€2.8 billion) and funds of 
funds (€1.1 billion). In January, foreign invest -
ment companies issued shares worth €2.2 bil -

banks were the only buyers of mutual fund 
shares (€18.4 billion), while non- resident in -
vestors and domestic credit institutions off -
loaded mutual fund shares worth €0.6 billion 
and €0.3 billion net, respectively. 
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €13.2 billion in January 2016. The result, 
which was €13.1 billion below the level of the 
previous month, arose from a lower trade sur -
plus combined with a decline in the invisible 
current transactions balance, which comprises 
services as well as primary and secondary in -
come.
In January, the surplus in the goods account 
decreased by €5.3 billion on the month to 
€13.3 billion. In this context, exports of goods 
dipped while imports of goods went up.
In the month under review, Germany recorded 
a minor deficit of €0.1 billion in invisible current 
transactions, compared with a surplus of €7.7 
billion in December. The chief reason for this 
turnaround was the €6.2 billion reduction in 
net receipts in the primary income balance to 
€5.0 billion. This was mainly due to a normal -
isation of other income following payment of 
the lion’s share of agricultural subsidies in De -
cember – as is standard practice at year’s end – 
under the EU budget. This was compounded 
by higher dividend payments to non- residents. 
Moreover, in the services account there was a 
switch from a surplus of €1.0 billion in Decem -
ber to a deficit of €2.8 billion one month later, 
largely on account of a fall in revenue gener -
ated by IT services. By contrast, the secondary 
income deficit narrowed, notably on the back Sharp contrac-

of lower public expenditure, by €2.2 billion to 
€2.3 billion.
In January, the international financial markets 
were influenced by pronounced foreign ex -
change and share price shifts combined with 
the prospect of continued monetary policy eas -
ing in the euro area. Against this backdrop, 
German portfolio investment generated net 
capital exports in the amount of €11.1 billion. 
This result was brought about in large part by 
securities purchases by resident investors to the 
tune of €9.9 billion, with an emphasis on bonds 
(€7.0 billion), money market paper (€2.6 billion) 
and mutual fund shares (€2.2 billion). Parallel 
to this, they parted with shares totalling €1.9 
billion. Meanwhile, foreign investors disposed 
of German securities worth €1.2 billion on bal -
ance, with sales of shares (€3.2 billion) and 
 mutual fund shares (€0.6 billion) being offset to 
a degree by purchases of money market paper 
(€2.1 billion) and bonds (€0.5 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital im -
ports in January of no less than €4.2 billion. 
German enterprises withdrew €6.7 billion 
worth of funds (in net terms) from their affili -
ates abroad, exclusively by means of inflows of 
funds occurring as intra- group lending (€10.5 billion). By contrast, resident direct investors 
boosted their equity capital abroad by €3.8 bil -
lion. Foreign investors scaled back their direct 
investment in Germany in January by a net €2.5 
billion, a move in which tightened intra- group 
lending (€6.5 billion) also played a significant 
role. Moreover, they provided German enter -
prises with additional equity capital of €4.1 bil -
lion.
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising loans and trade credits (where these do 
not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other assets, generated net 
capital imports of €15.2 billion in January. In 
the main, these were attributable to monetary 
financial institutions excluding the Bundesbank 
(€30.5 billion). Enterprises and households also 
saw an inflow of funds (€1.1 billion) whereas 
public authorities recorded net capital exports 
amounting to €6.0 billion. Added to this, the 
Bundesbank’s net claims vis- à- vis non- residents 
climbed by €10.3 billion, primarily on account 
of a decrease in foreign deposits at the Bundes -
bank which were down by €7.5 billion.

On the weakness of global trade
World trade has been disappointing in recent years, falling back from average annual growth 
rates as high as 6% between 1980 and 2007 to less than 3% since. Much of this contraction can 
be blamed on the slowdown in global economic growth, of course. However, global trade elas -
ticity – the ratio of world trade growth to global activity growth – has dwindled as well. This 
raises concerns that the pace of globalisation, and thus of international specialisation, might be 
faltering, a scenario which would have negative repercussions for economic progress.
Yet at the same time, it is possible to demonstrate that the convergence- driven shifts in global 
economic growth towards the emerging market economies explain a large chunk of the decline. 
The trade elasticity of the emerging market economies, which are gradually climbing through the 
ranks of the global economy, is far lower than that of the advanced economies. What is more, 
the swing towards the emerging market economies has been particularly strong for the trade-  
intensive components of economic activity, with the increase seen since 2008 in global invest -
ment and industrial output being generated solely by these up- and- coming economies.
So why exactly is the trade elasticity of economic growth so low in major emerging market econ -
omies? In the long term, imports and exports need to move broadly in tandem if imbalances are 
to be kept in check. Moreover, the slower rate of export market growth in the advanced econ -
omies is stifling foreign trade in the emerging market economies. Chinese exports, in particular, 
appear to be reaching their limits. China’s swift ascent in the global hierarchy has seen it evolve 
from a “small” economy to a “large” one for which international trade in goods plays second 
fiddle – being the world’s second- largest economy, China simply cannot run a predominantly 
export- led growth model over the long run.
All things considered, the disheartening path which international trade has taken in recent years 
probably very much reflects the growth profile of the global economy. There is precious little evi -
dence that global trade is inherently weak or that trade policy measures are having a major 
influence. Given that the emerging market economies are likely to continue outpacing the 
advanced economies, the trade intensity of global economic growth looks set to remain fairly 
low.Deutsche Bundesbank

Symptoms and diagnoses
The pace of global trade growth has fallen well 
short of expectations over the past few years. 
According to data from the International Mon -
etary Fund (IMF), trade volume growth has 
shrunk from a mean annual rate of as high as 
6% between 1980 and 2007 to no more than 
just under 3% since. If a log- linear trend is com -
puted for the years 1979 to 2007 and then ex -
trapolated, it can be shown that the trade vol -
ume in 2015 was down on this path by just over 
17%. Immediately prior to the onset of the 
global financial and economic crisis, the trade 
volume was still 7% up on the trend figures.
A good chunk of the sluggishness of global 
trade can be blamed, in mathematical terms, 
on the moderation of global economic growth, 
which has seen not only the international ex -
change of goods but also global economic ac -
tivity switch to a lower and flatter expansionary 
path since the financial and economic crisis. When real national gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth rates are aggregated using mar -
ket exchange rates, global economic activity 
climbed by 3% on average between 1980 and 
2007; since then, however, growth has dropped 
to no more than 2% per annum . It is no sur -
prise, then, that global value added also lagged 
behind its earlier trend path last year. An esti -
mation of the log- linear relationship with global 
economic activity explains two- thirds of the de -
viation of world trade from its pre- crisis path.1
There has, however, also been a shift in the 
ratio of world trade growth to global output 
growth. When relative growth rates are investi -
gated using five- year moving averages, world 
trade elasticity, as it is known, would appear to 
have diminished distinctly since the global 
financial  and economic crisis (see the technical 
annex on pages 33 to 35).2 What this calcula -
tion also reveals is that the elasticity had al -
ready been fairly volatile beforehand, visibly 
drifting higher in the late 1980s and early 
1990s before contracting around the year 
2000. If the average growth rates of the two 
variables are expressed as a ratio throughout 
the entire pre- crisis era, there is an elasticity of 
2. Hence the assumption by many experts that 
world trade expanded roughly twice as quickly 
as global economic activity over longer 
stretches. This ratio contracted to 1.4 in the 
post- crisis era, however.3Growth in

2 An analysis of the level of the world trade volume reveals 
that the deviations from a log- linear relationship with 
global economic activity (estimated for 1979-2007) started 
declining in 2008. This is another indication that elasticity 
may have fallen since 2007.
3 If national GDP rates are instead aggregated using pur -
chasing power parity exchange rates, the elasticity calcu -
lated according to this alternative method has declined 
more strongly still, receding from 1.7 to just 0.9. However, 
exchange rates based on purchasing power parities are 
 irrelevant for international trade, which means that global 
economic activity calculated on the basis of purchasing 
power parities does not constitute a suitable measure in 
this regard. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2013), The empir -
ical relationship between world trade and global economic 
output, op cit; and P Ollivaud and C Schwellnus, Does the

This persistent and uncharacteristic decline in 
global trade elasticity in recent years needs ex -
plaining. Fast- moving globalisation in the pre-  
crisis era had once been regarded as a major 
engine propelling the global economy. A genu -
ine lull in international trade could harm the 
economy at large and necessitate economic 
policy countermeasures.
Some believe that cyclical and structural factors 
might be behind the distinct weakness in world 
trade. Structural factors bring about deep and 
lasting change in the relationship linking inter -
national trade and economic activity. Examples 
notably include the pace of specialisation (also 
in the guise of multinational production chains), 
the level of protectionism and the role played 
by funding constraints.
The impact of short- lived cyclical factors, mean -
while, can be observed by using the annual 
quotients, rather than multiyear averages, of 
world trade volume growth and global eco -
nomic activity growth. Elasticities calculated ac -
cording to this method slumped particularly in 
1982 and 2001, when international trade con -
tracted or at least stagnated while the pace of 
global growth fell significantly. The steep rise in 
elasticity in 2009 also bore the tell- tale signs of 
cyclical factors. At that time, the decline in 
world trade outpaced the drop in economic 
activity  by a considerable margin. This drove up 
the elasticity (in mathematical terms), even 
though it was actually a manifestation of the 
pronounced weakness in trade.4
International trade is highly sensitive to cyclical 
factors primarily because trade activity focuses 
more on manufactured products and less on 
cyclically more stable services, though the latter 
account for the bulk of economic activity.5 
Note also that the output and trade flows are 
each used for different purposes. Economic ac -
tivity (ie value added) is a net measure which 
can be calculated by deducting intermediates. 
It is income that is ultimately either consumed 
or invested. Consumption accounts for three-  
quarters of worldwide expenditure, investment just one- quarter. Imports and exports, by con -
trast, are gross measures which include a large 
share of intermediates. Primary and intermedi -
ate products account for more than 60% of 
international merchandise trade. Furthermore, 
consumer and capital goods as a share of inter -
national goods trade (at roughly 22% and 15%, 
respectively) are far more balanced than their 
respective shares of aggregate expenditure.Possible implica-

5 Aggregate economic output consists of many goods that 
are not normally traded internationally, including a large 
number of services as well as construction. World Bank 
data indicate that services account for roughly 70% of 
global output. But services play a less important role for 
world trade, with a share of just one- fifth. The international 
exchange of goods is predominantly composed of trade in 
goods, particularly manufactured products, which make up 
just one- sixth of global output, but half of the volume of 
world trade.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

In times of recession, it is primarily spending on 
non- urgent goods – that is to say, mainly con -
sumer durables and capital goods – which 
tends to be postponed. This explains why in -
dustrial output is far more volatile than value 
added in the services sector. No less striking is 
the volatility of international trade, in which 
capital goods play a comparatively significant 
role, particularly when the corresponding inter -
mediate goods are taken into account. This is 
consistent, on the aggregate expenditure side, 
with the rich import content attributed to in -
vestment, especially, but also to exports.6
Above all the sharp downturn in international 
goods flows in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 
the first quarter of 2009 was seen in the con -
text of the simultaneous emergence of reces -
sionary tendencies across a number of coun -
tries, particularly in terms of industrial output 
and investment.7 This cyclical interpretation of 
the then prevailing weakness in world trade 
was borne out, it seemed, by the fairly robust 
rebound seen in the years immediately follow -
ing the crisis. The downswing in global eco -
nomic growth in 2012 was accompanied by a 
stronger slowdown in the expansion of inter -
national goods trading. Studies continued to 
highlight the role played by cyclical factors, 
above all the persistently weak investment in 
advanced economies,8 yet a great deal of the 
slump in international trade still appears to be 
unexplained, even after making allowances for 
the compositional shift in global demand.9 The 
existence of a residual of this size is often seen 
as pointing to the influence of structural fac -
tors.
One line of argumentation that has made par -
ticular headway posits that the expansion of 
global value chains – or even globalisation it -
self – is losing steam. A widely cited study by 
Constantinescu et al (2015) sees this as the root 
cause of the shift in the long- term relationship 
between world trade and economic activity.10 
Previously, China’s international role had often 
been hailed as a model for vertical integration 
(“extended workbench”), given that the coun -try mainly processed imported intermediate 
inputs  and then re- exported them as final prod -
ucts to the United States. But now, the authors 
wrote, the sluggish performance of imports, 
above all in these countries, was showing that 
the international division of labour was moving 
forward more slowly. There are also many 
 studies which discuss the role that protection -
ism might be playing in the sluggishness of 
world trade.
World trade and economic 
activity
The commonly drawn distinction between the 
cyclical and structural determinants of the slug -
gishness of world trade paints an incomplete 
picture, ignoring, as it does, the other compos -
ition effects, besides the expenditure split of 
economic activity, which can impair global 
trade elasticity. Furthermore, their influence 
need not necessarily be temporary in nature.

omies and the group of emerging market econ -
omies and developing countries. For the latter 
group, the ratio of average import growth 
rates11 to average GDP growth rates has shrunk 
from a pre- crisis 1.4 to 1.0 since 2008, while 
that of the industrial countries even dwindled 
to just 1.9 from 2.1. The discrepancy between 
the relatively small decline for the individual 
groups of countries and the perceptible drop in 
the global ratio suggests that composition 
effects  might be at play. Owing to the lower 
trade elasticity of the emerging market econ -
omies, a mere shift in the focus of growth to -
wards this first group can act as a drag on 
global elasticity, even if the relationships remain 
invariant at the deeper level.12
Global economic growth has indeed been sup -
ported quite substantially by the emerging mar -
ket economies in recent years, in a shift away 
from the situation in the 1980s and 1990s when 
the advanced economies were still the main en -
gine driving growth. While real GDP growth in 
the industrial countries eased significantly over 
time, growth rates even gained traction at times 
in the up- and- coming economies. Since 2000, 
the emerging market economies have been out -
pacing their advanced counterparts by at least 
1¾ percentage points per annum , and the gap 
widened to as much as 6½ percentage points 
when the advanced economies fell into deep re -
cession in 2009. These dynamics doubled the 
emerging market economies’ contribution to 
global economic activity to just shy of 40% be -
tween 1999 and 2015, and their importance for 
international trade increased on roughly the 
same scale. This explains why the emerging mar -Shift in global

11 Imports and exports ought to match up at the global 
level, but that need not be the case for individual countries. 
It is common to analyse imports when investigating the 
relationship with economic activity at the country level. 
That is because imports are widely thought to be sensitive 
to an economy’s aggregate demand, unlike exports, which 
are characterised more by external demand.
12 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The decline in the elasticity 
of global trade to global economic activity, Monthly Re -
port, January 2015, pp 27-29. One reason for the relatively 
low trade intensity of economic growth in the emerging 
market economies might be that a given external impulse 
generates a relatively strong increase in income (starting 
from a lower level) in those countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

ket economies are now such a major driver of 
global expansion, and also why the slowdown 
in the advanced economies is no longer affect -
ing the global rate as much as it would have 
done in the past.
A straightforward counterfactual experiment 
shows how shifts in the make-up of the global 
economy have affected the trade intensity of 
global growth. This experiment draws on data 
for a total of 42 economies, including a num -
ber of major emerging market economies, and 
their import elasticities, expressed as the ratio 
of the average growth rates of imports to real 
GDP in the pre- crisis era (1980 to 2007). The idiosyncratic elasticities are then kept constant 
throughout the entire period up until 2014 and 
only their weights, ie the national import shares 
and relative growth rates, are varied in line with 
actual data.13 The experiment reveals that the 
computed hypothetical global trade elasticity in 
the last few years has veered deeply to the 
downside of the pre- crisis average of 2, drop -
ping to 1½ in 2012 and 2013. All in all, this 
analysis can explain roughly half of the contrac -
tion in global elasticity.14
By splitting global trade elasticity into its con -
stituent components, it is possible to quantify 
the notional contributions of individual coun -
tries or groups of countries. The gap between 
actual contributions and their hypothetical 
counterparts allows a conclusion to be drawn 
on the extent to which changes in the national 
elasticities have become significant at the 
global level. As a case in point, only a small part 
of the increase in the world trade elasticity ac -
tually observed during the 1980s and 1990s is 
reflected in the hypothetical contributions. This 
is mainly because economic growth became 
more trade- intensive in nature, particularly in 
the industrial countries. Much of the subse -
quent decline in global elasticity, on the other 
hand, is also reflected in the above experiment. 
In other words, that share of the decline origin -
ates from the shift in global growth towards 
the emerging market economies. It can be con -
cluded that it was above all the weakness in 
the euro- area economy in the wake of the 
 financial and economic crisis, and later on after 
the sovereign debt crisis, which deteriorated 
world trade. In the case of the United States, 
however, the actual contribution to global

14 The decline in the hypothetical global elasticity is 
stronger still if the experiment is expanded by additionally 
fixing the national shares at their pre- crisis mean averages, 
ie only the relative growth is varied. When viewed in isol -

elasticity because at the end of the day, it is the economies

trade elasticity has sometimes fallen noticeably 
short of the hypothetical measure in recent 
years, which suggests that the slowdown in 
GDP growth was compounded by idiosyncratic 
import weakness. The bulk of the gap that 
began to emerge between the actual global 
elasticity and its hypothetical counterpart in 
2010, however, can be attributed to the emer -
ging market economies, first and foremost the 
Chinese economy. The import intensity of eco -
nomic growth in China appears to have con -
tracted perceptibly in recent years.
Against this backdrop, global trade elasticity in 
the years ahead looks set to run at noticeably 
lower levels than in the pre- crisis era, judging 
by how persistently the balance has shifted in 
the global economy. The inroads which the 
emerging market economies have made into 
international trade will probably be permanent, 
and the relative growth rates also appear to 
have shifted for good. While economic growth 
in the industrial countries has rebounded a lit -
tle, now that the euro- area recession sparked 
by the sovereign debt crisis has been over -
come, and the growth outlook for the emer -
ging market economies has dimmed in recent 
years,15 it is nonetheless highly likely that the 
up- and- coming economies will continue to far 
outpace their advanced counterparts in the 
near future.
The key results of this analysis are robust to 
various modifications, particularly one in which 
the individual countries’ trade volumes (defined 
as the weighted sum of real imports and ex -
ports) are investigated instead of imports. It is 
noteworthy, though, that the United States is 
no longer quite as prominent in this modifica -
tion. Idiosyncratic developments are probably 
to blame for the subdued upward path of US 
imports (see the box on page 20).
The significance of the geographical compos -
ition of global economic growth is also con -
firmed when alternative measures of trade elas -
ticity are used. A paper by Stratford (2015) goes 
as far as to demonstrate that this effect can explain almost all of the weakness in global 
trade, as long as the reference points used are 
hypothetical import growth rates derived from 
adjusting national GDP rates such that they 
have the same mean and variance as the 
changes in imports.16 Historically, world trade 
has not only grown twice as quickly as eco -
nomic activity on average – the variance of 
trade growth dynamics measured with the aid 
of the standard deviation was in fact more than 
three times the size. According to that paper, it 
is not unusual for a general lull in economic 
activity to be accompanied by an even stronger 
decline in trade growth. While adjusting the 
global rates to allow for this does not help to Shift in global

explain the sluggish rate of import growth 
since 2012, given that the global economy did 
not expand at such an uncharacteristically 
weak pace during those years, the global per -
spective does, however, mask more substantial 
deviations at the country level which come to 
bear when national GDP rates are adjusted and 
then aggregated.17 This approach highlights 
the role which the geographical composition of 
economic growth can potentially play in con -
junction with the stronger variance of inter -
national goods flows. Since the composition 
effect does not fully explain the weakness of 
world trade in more conventional analytical ap -
proaches, it might prove worthwhile to take a 
closer look at the variant components of eco -
nomic activity.
Demand- side breakdown
On the demand side, it is investment which 
fluctuates to a similarly strong degree as for -eign trade flows and is relatively closely con -
nected to them owing to the high import con -
tent. Moreover, prolonged investment slumps 
are quite conceivable, which means that an 
explanation can also be given for fairly persist -
ent deviations from historical norms. One can 
hardly speak of weak global investment since 
the financial and economic crisis, however. 
Real gross investment in the group of 42 coun -
tries considered here even rose marginally more 
strongly than price- adjusted consumption ex -
penditure on an average for the years 2008 to 
2014. Yet this masks highly divergent develop -Large inter-
national discrep-ancies in invest -
ment activityExternal trade in the United States
Some see the relatively weak growth of US 
imports in recent years as a sign that glob-alisation trends are on the wane. Yet at the 
same time, exports have been following a far more upbeat path. While real US im-
ports of goods and services grew at an an-
nual rate of just 1½% between 2008 and 2015, exports expanded twice as quickly (3%). This pace is also impressive when compared with aggregate economic 
growth – real gross domestic product (GDP) 
rose by an average of 1¼% per year over 
the same period. These contrasting patterns 
in US external trade probably owe a great 
deal to adjustments made in connection 
with the United States’ external imbalance, which was fairly pronounced right up to the 
onset of the fi  nancial and economic crisis. 
Due consideration should also be given to 
the tangible impact of what has been termed the fracking boom, which has seen a sharp expansion of unconventional oil ex-traction methods in the United States push 
down imports of crude oil and petroleum- 
based products by 4% annually since 2008. 
Excluding crude oil thus drives the average 
growth rate of imports of goods and ser-
vices sharply higher to 2½%, which is only 
narrowly short of the pace set by exports. 
Added to this, the past two years in particu-
lar have seen imports regain greater mo-
mentum. Upbeat domestic demand relative 
to the USA’s major trading partners could 
have been a factor here, as could the recent 
appreciation of the US dollar. All things considered, then, it seems questionable 
whether US import data can deliver any in-sights into what might be propelling world trade at a deeper level.
17 Some of the particular characteristics of this approach 
are worth highlighting. First, it is a regression of import 
growth to GDP growth and a constant in the event of per -
fect correlation. No such parallel movement has been ob -
served in the past, however. Second, the constant mean 
implies that the apparent trade elasticity varies with the 
level of economic growth. Third, the robustness of the as -
sumption of a constant mean import growth is doubtful, 
given the persistent downside deviations observed in re -
cent years.  Finally, the results produced by the approach do 
not appear to be insensitive to the choice of reference 
period.Deutsche Bundesbank

ments in the individual economies. Ultimately, 
growth in gross investment is solely attribut -
able to the emerging market economies, not -
ably China, where real investment expenditure 
climbed to twice its pre- crisis level by 2014. In 
the other emerging market economies, real in -
vestment expenditure rose by just under one-  
third, whereas investment activity in the indus -
trial countries was even 5% down on the level 
measured in 2007. The global expansion of pri -
vate and public consumption proved to be 
more balanced. In the meantime, these growth 
differentials have led to a conspicuous mis -
match between China’s shares in the expend -
iture components. In 2014, China’s households 
and general government together accounted 
for just over 10% of all consumption expend -
iture, but almost 30% of investment expend -
iture, in the group of countries analysed in this 
article.
As well as special developments in investment 
and consumption activity, consideration also 
needs to be given to country and demand-  
specific propensities to import. It is remarkable 
that, particularly in China, import growth and 
investment growth appear to be closely correl -
ated.18 This indicates that the reorientation of 
the Chinese economy, now underway, towards 
greater consumerism is unlikely to benefit im -
ports, especially in the next few years. By con -
trast, it was probably primarily the constraints 
on euro- area investment that curbed global im -
ports during the sovereign debt crisis.19 More 
recently, adjustments in the commodity-  
exporting economies may have had a distinct 
dampening effect (see the box on pages  23 
and 24).
Breakdown by sector
Mirroring the importance of individual demand 
variables, a breakdown by sector of the supply 
side in connection with the regional distribu -
tion also grants some insight into the weakness 
in world trade. There are no comprehensive 
international datasets which provide a long his -tory of the breakdown of value added by sec -
tor. However, data from the Dutch Centraal 
Planbureau in the World Trade Monitor  make it 
possible to place industrial output and the im -
port of goods into context for the world as a Adjustments to

whole and for individual economic areas.20 The 
development in the case of industry is found to 
be unbalanced in much the same way as that 
for investment. For example, the 16½% in -
crease in global industrial output since 2008 is 
attributable solely to the emerging market 
economies.21 Whereas output in those coun -
tries exceeded the pre- crisis level by 47% last 
year, it fell short of that mark by just over 4% in 
the advanced economies. The source of the 
growth can be narrowed down even more 
closely still, namely to an increase in output by 
almost 86% in the Asian emerging market 
economies that was mainly driven by China. 
On the other hand, non-  Asian emerging mar -
ket economies saw their output rise by a com -
paratively modest 6%.
Additionally, the trade intensity of output 
growth differs quite significantly between the 
economic areas. Asian emerging market econ -
omies’ imports of goods rose at merely the 
same pace as their industrial output on an aver -age for the years 1992 to 2007. Trade elasticity 
in the advanced economies was almost three 
times as high. It is therefore not surprising that 
the growth rates in global output achieved in 
Asia have not generated any disproportionate 
increases in imports in recent years either. Yet 
at the current end, imports by Asian emerging 
market economies have even fallen short of 
what might be expected when viewed in a his -
torical context. Nevertheless, the rise in the ad -
vanced economies’ imports of goods – coincid -
ing with a drop in industrial output – rules out 
globally effective, trade- specific factors as an 
explanation for the sluggishness of global im -
ports. There is no indication of production 
which had previously been outsourced to the 
emerging market economies being reshored to 
the industrial countries.
Further explanatory factors 
and reservations
Whereas composition effects probably go a 
long way towards explaining the decline in 
elasticity, evidence that points to other factors 
is less clear- cut. Analysis of developments in 
the international division of labour is rendered 
difficult by the fact that foreign trade statistics 
only cover gross flows.22 For this reason, inter -
mediate goods as a share of total trade or of 
trade in certain product groups is often used as 
a simple measure of the degree of vertical inte -
gration. This share has maintained its rather 
high level in recent years, meaning that it does 
not give any indication of sharp reductions in

which accounts for only a minor part of world trade. By 
contrast, Constantinescu et al (2015) examined the elasti -

Recent trends in world trade in goods
International trade has remained listless in 
recent times, too. Based on data from the 
Dutch Centraal Planbureau (CPB), the vol-
ume of international trade in goods grew by just 2½% last year. In terms of value, 
cross- border trade even shrunk signifi  cantly 
on a US dollar basis. However, the main 
factors behind this were probably the purely 
nominal effect of the US currency’s major appreciation and the at times huge de-
creases in the prices of commodities, which make up an important part of world trade. In any case, the shifts in relative prices could 
have exacerbated latent problems in the price adjustment of nominal trade fi  gures, thus necessitating caution when interpret-ing real goods fl  ows, too, which are rele-
vant from a macroeconomic perspective.1
Looking at world trade from the imports side, last year’s sluggishness was attribut-
able chiefl  y to the group of emerging mar-
ket economies (EMEs), where the import 
volume even declined slightly, according to 
CPB’s calculations. By contrast, the indus-trial countries’ imports saw fairly robust 
growth,2 as confi  rmed by national accounts 
data. In particular, the USA’s real goods and 
services imports rose sharply last year (+5%), possibly bolstered by gains in pur-chasing power owing to exchange rate changes. But the imports of the United Kingdom and the euro area also picked up 
with equal momentum (+6¼% and +5¾% 
respectively).3 The virtual stagnation in de-
liveries to Japan should be viewed in the 
context of the very high increases in previ-
ous years and weak growth in gross domes-tic product (GDP).
Given this import growth in the advanced 
economies, the more likely explanation for 
the current weakness of world trade is spe-cifi  c infl  uences on EMEs, rather than factors with a global impact. China is the fi  rst case in point. Probably for the fi  rst time in a long while, China’s imports recorded a slight de-
crease last year.4 This is surprising because 
although the Chinese economy is no longer quite as dynamic as before, it still saw major 
growth by international standards. How-
ever, the engines of the domestic economy 
seem to have shifted from investment to consumption. According to offi   cial esti-mates, two- thirds of last year’s economic 
growth was generated by consumption and 
just one- third by investment. In addition, real exports apparently declined slightly. Since China’s consumption comprises a smaller import share than investment and especially exports, the observed demand- side shift in economic growth is likely to have dampened imports when viewed in isolation.
5 Moreover, that same economic 
1 The discrepancy between the real rates of change in 
global exports and imports of goods calculated by CPB 
points to certain statistical problems at the current 
juncture. With an increase of 3¼%, the reported rate 
of growth for international exports is almost twice as 
high as that for global imports (1¾%).2 The industrial countries’ exports of goods (+2%) did not rise to the same degree as their imports (+3½%). In relation to the meagre growth in their industrial out-
put (+¾%), however, the increase in exports was still 
noteworthy.3 In the national accounts, euro- area imports also in-clude the individual member states’ imports from other euro- area countries.4 China publishes data on price- adjusted foreign trade fl  ows based on unit values only. In this approach, im-ports of goods decreased by 2% in 2015.5 According to the OECD’s Trade in Value Added data-base, the import content of China’s consumption was only around 10%, compared with 18% for investment 
and 30% for exports (based on 2011 in each case; 
more recent data is not available).Growth in global goods imports

production chains. However, it has ceased to 
rise at the pace seen in pre- crisis years. This 
may have contributed to the decline in global 
trade elasticity.23 But this may also be inter -
preted as a cyclical phenomenon rather than a 
structural dislocation, since trade in intermedi -
ate goods is subject to sharper cyclical swings.24
Trade in value added, which is estimated by 
linking national input- output accounts, presents 
a similarly ambivalent picture.25 On the one 
hand, foreign value added as a share of exports 
fell significantly in the course of the financial 
and economic crisis in 2009. On the other 
hand, it recovered somewhat during the fol -
lowing two years. Veenendaal et al (2015) 
point out that in 2011, the year up to which the 
data run, particularly foreign value added as a 
share of exports of European and east Asian 
countries moved towards new all- time highs.26 
Nagengast and Stehrer (2015) show that a re -
striction of the division of labour played a con -
siderable part in the decline of value added trade in 2009, and that by 2011 the degree of 
specialisation had not yet regained its pre- crisis 
level. Moreover, the results of their study point 
to a cyclical pattern in specialisation, indicating 
that a reduction of the division of labour is not 
unusual in an economic downturn, and that in 
a downturn phase, a change in the degree of 
… or to trade in 
value addedgrowth – and hence also the growth in de-
mand components – was potentially some-what lower last year than offi   cially stated.
6
Aside from China, the main contributors to 
the decline in EME imports last year were Brazil and Russia. In both economies, the loss of income brought about by the drop 
in commodity prices choked domestic de-
mand. In the case of Brazil, the commodity- related strains were compounded by a ser-ious political crisis as well as the limited abil-ities of monetary and fi  scal policy. Although fi  nal domestic demand subsided to a com-parable extent in both countries, the slump 
in imports was still signifi  cantly stronger in 
Russia. The relatively sharp depreciation of 
the rouble was one likely factor. Another 
potentially pertinent factor was that, as part of a new development strategy, the Russian government has opted to push ahead with domestic production in place of imports.

specialisation could even be more significant 
than in a phase of expansion.27 Thus, the evi -
dence does not provide compelling proof that 
the structural link between trade growth and 
economic growth was impaired.
Trade policy appears to do little to explain the 
decline in elasticity. According to World Trade 
Organisation (WTO) data, more trade- restricting 
measures are introduced year for year than are 
abolished. However, the speed at which they 
are introduced has varied little in recent years. 
What is more, only a small fraction of global 
trade in goods is subject to the new restrictions 
that have been implemented since 2008.28 
Overall, the part that protectionism played in 
the collapse of world trade during the financial 
and economic crisis is considered to be mar -
ginal.29 Of course, it is sometimes difficult to 
gauge the impact of such measures. Very little 
headway has been made since 2005 in the dis -
mantling of tariffs, which is clearly quantifiable 
by comparison, after good progress had previ -
ously been made.30
Another trend that has virtually come to a halt 
in recent years is the political fragmentation of 
the world. The drawing of new borders creates 
international trade without a rise in income, as 
hitherto domestic flows of goods are subse -
quently counted towards foreign trade.31 Ac-
cording to a study by Lavallée and Vicard 
(2013), around 17% of world trade was attrib -
utable to such a statistical artefact in 2007 
compared with 1948.32 The number of sover -
eign states rose significantly in the 1990s in 
particular following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union.
Over and above any additional explanatory 
variables, factors should be emphasised that 
generally impair the meaningfulness of studies 
on world trade. Ultimately, it is the develop -Effect of protec-

ment of real variables that is relevant for eco -
nomic analysis. However, the necessary price 
adjustment of flows in terms of value entails 
considerable problems. Besides nominal im -
ports and exports, unit values are also recorded 
in foreign trade statistics; but often these do 
not adequately take differences in quality into 
account.33 On the other hand, the price indices 
constructed for this purpose may be slow to 
capture trade in new products. Moreover, the 
quality of the measurement is not assured to 
the same extent as with consumer prices. These 
measurement difficulties not only impair the es -
timates of real trade flows: they may also make 
it more difficult to identify the effect of relative 
price shifts, which should – alongside increases 
in income – be given a major role in determin -
ing changes to imports and exports.
The robustness of data for emerging market 
economies in particular is not assured. China’s 
statistics office does not publish any price-  
adjusted import or export series in its national accounts.34 Questions also arise regarding the 
data on macroeconomic growth, notably in 
connection with deflating.35 Since India revised 
its official statistics, the country’s economy has 
presented a markedly more favourable picture 
of the last few years36 which is not necessarily 
in keeping with key economic indicators. In 
view of this, it would be wrong to draw too 
sweeping conclusions from the finding that im -
port volumes saw a weaker development in 
major emerging market economies in particular 
than would have been expected from the his -
torical correlations to real GDP growth.
Conclusion and further 
 considerations
To a great extent, the weakness of international 
trade in recent years has been directly attribut -
able to the slowdown in global economic 
growth. Beyond that, however, it raises the 
fundamental question as to whether the pro -
cess of globalisation and therefore of inter -
national specialisation has slowed down. This 
would have to be reflected by a broad- based 
reduction in country- specific trade elasticities. 
Apart from several exceptions, there are no 
clear signs of this. Rather, it may be seen that 
the shift of economic growth towards coun -
tries with low trade elasticities has reduced 
global elasticity. In contrast to the pre- crisis 
years, global economic growth in the past few 
years has for the most part been driven by the 
emerging market economies, whose growth 
shows a relatively low import intensity. Viewed 
in isolation, this effect goes some way towards 
solving the riddle surrounding world trade. The 
explanatory contribution becomes greater 
when shifts in the supply and demand- side 
composition of economic activity are likewise

The catching- up process of major emerging market 
 economies and its implications for global trade – an analysis using the gravity model
Prior to the global fi  nancial and economic 
crisis, the rapid growth of key emerging market economies (EMEs) was accompan-ied by a massive increase in their foreign 
trade activities. In the case of China, in par-
ticular, the build- up of a high- performing 
manufacturing industry was seen as an en-
gine of the catching- up process. China’s  industrial sector specialised in turning im-
ported inputs into fi  nished products for ex-port to many regions in the world, particu-
larly the advanced economies. Although 
the EMEs’ economic upturn has tailed off in 
recent years,1 they have maintained their 
lead in growth over the advanced econ-omies. However, foreign trade fl  ows have seen even more pronounced deceleration. This box will discuss some of the implica-tions of the persistent gap in growth be-tween the industrialised nations and the EMEs for the ratio between the growth 
rates of international trade fl  ows and global GDP , ie the global trade elasticity. It will de-
vote particular attention to the role played 
by China.
The analysis will begin with a simple gravity 
equation which, in modifi  ed form, is the 
basis for many empirical studies of foreign 
trade.2 According to Newton’s Universal 
Law of Gravitation, the attraction ( F) be-
tween two masses (Mi and Mj) increases in 
proportion to the product of these variables 
and falls as the distance between them 
(Dij) increases, while g is a constant:
(1) Fij=gM iMj
D2
ij.
By analogy, trade ( Tij) between two coun-
tries (i and j ) can be modelled as the out-
put of their economic masses (measured in terms of real GDP Y), the distance between 
them and a constant (k):
(2) Tij=kYiYj
D2
ij.
Approaches of this type are compatible 
with a variety of stylised facts. Neighbour-
ing countries tend to share closer trade links 
than countries further apart; small econ-
omies are relatively open (ie trade is import-
ant relative to income), whereas large coun-tries are relatively closed.
According to the gravity equation, the eco-
nomic power of both partners is relevant to the intensity of their exchange of goods; at 
a given overall income, the ratio between 
the two economies’ sizes plays a role. If dis-
tance does not matter, bilateral trade is maximised if the two economies are the same size; similarity permits intensive eco-nomic relationships. In such a world with-
out distances, the rate of change in bilateral 
goods trade is determined by the sum of national gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates. If these differ, the fast- 
growing economy will have a low elasticity owing to the consistent increase in bilateral trade, while the slow- growing economy will have a high elasticity.

the emerging market economies, Monthly Report, July

1, …, q ) are aggregated, one obtains for

,
where si denotes a country’s share of global 
economic output. Consequently, the last 
term represents the impact of the size dif-
ferential between the economies. If they 
are identical, this maximises global trade. 
The equation also implies a global trade 
elasticity of 2, provided the weights do not 
shift during the growth process.3 If the size 
differentials shrink, ie, for instance, the EMEs gain ground against the advanced 
economies, this results in a higher elasticity.
Against this background, the fl  ow and ebb 
of the EMEs’ catching- up process has been 
cited as an explanation for the observed 
evolution of global trade elasticity.4 If trade 
is simulated for three regions (euro area, other advanced economies and EMEs) ac-
cording to equation (2) with the respective 
trend components of real GDP growth, 
global trade elasticity goes up in the years 
prior to the fi  nancial and economic crisis; it 
subsequently falls to again approach the 
value of 2.5 This is predicated, however, on 
disregarding the distance between the re-
gions. In actual fact, however, global trade 
elasticity in the past few years did not re-
turn to its long- run level but even dropped well below it. Above all, however, the slump had already started prior to the crisis, just as the convergence process was beginning to pick up considerable steam.
Such a trend can be retraced using equa-
tion (2) if the economically relevant distance 
3 It must be emphasised here that this elasticity value 
is the outcome of an analogy to a purely physical 
model. By contrast, linking the gravity equation to eco-
nomic approaches generally leads to an elasticity value of 1. This is because, in a world with no distortions and identical preferences, each country’s share of expend-iture on goods must be the same everywhere, conse-
quently representing its share of global GDP . In place 
of a constant, the inverse of global GDP is then entered 
into equation (3). See P Hong (1999), Import elastici-
ties revisited, loc cit; J E Anderson (1979), A theoretical 
foundation for the gravity equation, American Eco-
nomic Review, Vol 69, pp 106-116; and J E Anderson

nomic Research, Working Paper 16576.

between the EMEs and advanced regions is 
suffi   ciently larger than the relevant distance 
between the developed economies.6 A re-
covery process in the periphery will do only 
relatively little to stimulate international 
trade.7 Here, the EMEs’ greater distance is 
to be understood not only in a geograph-
ical sense. It could also be interpreted as the subordinated importance of fi  nal de-mand in the EMEs. Given that the inter-national division of labour is primarily geared towards production to meet fi  nal demand in the advanced economies, it comes as no surprise that faster- growing 
demand in the EMEs does relatively little to boost global trade.
The gravity equation illustrates the fact that 
the trade fl  ows of an economy are infl  u-
enced by the level and growth of real GDP 
in its partner countries. It is particularly 
some Asian EMEs which, in the past, made 
good progress by building up an effi   cient 
export sector. According to the Penn World 
Tables, South Korea, for instance, increased 
its per capita GDP based on purchasing power parities (PPPs) from 7% of the US level in 1960 to 65% in 2010. Over the 
same period, the ratio of goods exports to GDP rose from 1% to 42%. China followed a similar, though lagged, path, and in 2010 achieved one- fi  fth of US per capita income 
with a ratio of goods exports to GDP of around 20%; this is more or less where South Korea stood in 1980. Against this 
background, one might get the impression 
that China’s export- driven recovery process 
could still have quite a future ahead of it. However, whereas South Korea is a small 
country which can relatively easily create a 
niche in the system of the international div-
ision of labour, China’s sheer size alone 
tends to set limits to the Chinese economy’s 
export growth.Thus, in Japan, which should likewise be re-
garded as a relatively large economy, the 
export sector never achieved the dimen-sions that can currently be seen in South Korea. According to data from the World 
Bank, which are based on conversions using market exchange rates, China accounted in

costs (“multilateral resistance”). See J Anderson and 
E van Wincoop (2003), Gravity with gravitas: a solution 
to the border puzzle, American Economic Review, 
Vol 93, pp 170-192.
7 Admittedly, the sharp rise in global trade elasticity in the 1990s cannot be simulated in this fashion. From an accountig point of view it is attributable mainly to the advanced economies.Degree of openness, income convergence and economic size

2014 for just over 13% of global (nominal) 
GDP .8 Japan had such a weight in 1986 – 
yet its exports (of goods and services) to 
GDP ratio, at 11%, was a paltry half the 
level last seen in China. Measured in terms 
of the global importance of the Chinese economy, its export sector is thus already strikingly massive. Indeed, in 2014 China 
was tied with the United States of America 
as the number one leading exporter, ac-counting for 10% of the value of global 
 exports.9
Given that there still exists a pronounced 
 income dispersion, China’s real GDP is likely to grow considerably more rapidly than that of the rest of the world in the years to come as well. On the other hand, in the long run 
China’s exports will not be able to grow more strongly than the partner countries’ imports.
10 Chinese exporters appear re-
cently to have been having a more diffi   cult time expanding their market share further.
11 
Consequently, for China, like other coun-tries, export growth will be increasingly 
constrained by the growth of sales markets. 
Owing to the very rapid pace of income growth, some years ago China already reached the point as of which export 
growth lagged behind its own GDP growth 
rate. Thus, the exports- to- GDP ratio fell from its high of nearly 36% in 2006 to a mere 22½% in 2014. In order to maintain 
its openness to some degree, China would 
have had to enhance its global market 
share perceptibly more strongly in the past few years.
Should the Chinese economy continue to grow considerably faster than the rest of 
the world in the future, too, its exports- to- GDP ratio is likely to drop further – and its 
trade elasticity to be correspondingly low. 
This is ultimately a mirror image of develop-
ments in the United States or Japan, the 
economies of which are similarly large but are growing more slowly. Those countries’ 
degree of openness is increasing, whereas 
their relative importance for global GDP is 
declining.12 On the whole, it is no big sur-
prise that China, as part of its transition to a large economy, is becoming more and more 
a closed economy.13 Admittedly, the high 
GDP growth projected by many for China in 
the coming years is by no means a done deal. Given that foreign trade is not ex-pected to provide much of a boost, and that investment is already playing an out-
sized role, Chinese consumption is going to 
have to become the driver of the Chinese 
upswing.
8 Whereas incomes should be converted based on 
PPPs in order to compare standards of living, it is advis-
able to use market exchange rates in order to refl  ect 
the actual size of economies.
9 According to these fi  gures, Germany’s share 
amounted to 7½%.
10 See also M D Chinn, China’s trade fl  ows: some con-
jectures, in B Hoekman (ed, 2015), The global trade 
slowdown: a new normal?, Centre for Economic Policy Research, VoxEU.org eBook, pp 229-252.
11 In the past few years, the Chinese share of total 
industrial goods imports to the European Union and 
the United States has already even begun to stagnate. See Deutsche Bundesbank, The development of labour costs in China and their impact on consumer prices in 
the industrial countries, Monthly Report, May 2013, 
pp 13-15.
12 The German economy’s openness is also rising in 
inverse proportion to its weight in the world. It is al-
ready a relatively highly open economy owing to its 
interlinkages within Europe.
13 This is consistent with a model of intra- industry 
trade in which the consumers’ basket of goods refl  ects 
global output shares. An economy becomes more 
closed as its size increases since consumption refl  ects 
the growing global signifi  cance of domestic produc-
tion. The economies’ relative sizes then represent a key determinant of global trade. As the size and per capita income of an economy grow, intra- industry trade gains 
in empirical importance. The increasingly important role of intra- industry trade for China is also verifi  ed. See E Helpman (1987), Imperfect competition and 
international trade: evidence from fourteen industrial 
countries, Journal of the Japanese and International Economies, Vol 1, pp 62-81, B Balassa (1986), Intra-  
 industry specialization – a cross- country analysis, Euro-
pean Economic Review, Vol 30, pp 27-42, and G M 
Caporale, A Sova and R Sova (2015), Trade fl  ows and

taken into consideration. This is because only 
emerging market economies have generated 
the increase in worldwide investment activity 
and in industrial output, which have proved to 
be especially trade- intensive, since the eco -
nomic and financial crisis.
However, it is questionable to what extent elas -
ticities are actually structural in nature at the 
national level. It is striking that particularly 
countries with high economic growth have low 
trade elasticity. This means that the different 
degrees of elasticity could reflect relative 
growth.37 This is seen in a simple, structureless 
gravity model in which the trade flows of an 
economy are also determined by the partner 
countries’ income and distance (see the box on 
pages  27 to 30). Under such an approach, 
global elasticity is also dampened by growth 
ratios when global economic growth is gener -
ated mainly in countries far removed from the 
centres of world trade. Given that emerging 
market economies focus more strongly on sup -
plying primary and intermediate products and 
exporting final consumer goods to the indus -
trial countries, it is not surprising that the 
growth of their final domestic demand – and 
notably in consumption – possibly creates rela -
tively little stimulus to world trade.
With regard to the Chinese economy, the high 
growth rate of real GDP implies a substantial 
rise in the degree of openness, even with a 
trade elasticity of only slightly more than 1. 
Moreover, the international growth differential 
is resulting in a rapid increase in the Chinese 
share in world trade. For a while, Chinese ex -
ports did profit from massive market share 
gains abroad. But in the long run, China’s ex -
ports cannot grow much more strongly than 
the imports of its partner countries.38 Chinese 
imports, on the other hand, ultimately have to 
keep in step with exports if a growing external 
imbalance is to be avoided. Thus it follows that 
a persistent gap in growth between China and 
the rest of the world causes a drop in the elas -
ticity of Chinese imports such as is also esti -
mated in the IMF staff projections.39 In view of its rapidly growing global importance, China 
may appear to be “closed” in much the same 
way as other large economies. Alternatively, 
Chinese GDP growth could decline more 
strongly than expected, or the real exchange 
rate could undergo a correspondingly marked 
adjustment.Possible endo-

37 As early as 1989, Krugman pointed to a link between 
relative trade elasticities and relative growth rates, and pro -
posed supply- side effects as an explanation. Wu (2008) de -
veloped an intertemporal model in this regard. See P Krug -
man (1989), Differences in income elasticities and trends in 
real exchange rates, European Economic Review, Vol 33, 
pp 1031-1047; and Y Wu (2008), Growth, expansion of 
markets, and income elasticities in world trade, Review of 
International Economics, Vol 16, pp 654-671.
38 In a number of industrial countries in particular, the per -
sistence of rather large external trade balances is some -
times also noticeable. However, this is a reflection of differ -
ences in import and export levels and not of lasting dis -
crepancies in dynamics.
39 In the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of October 2015 
for 2020, China’s imports were projected to rise by just 4% 
compared with an increase in GDP of 6¼% over the same 
period.Deutsche Bundesbank

Generally speaking, the advanced economies’ 
imports restrict the emerging market econ -
omies’ imports if the latter have to be paid for 
using foreign currency revenues from current 
export revenues.40 A slowdown in economic 
growth in the industrial countries would then 
impair the income elasticity of imports in other 
countries. The adjustment pressure on import -
ant commodity- exporting emerging market 
economies is likely to be increased even more 
by, at times, sharp deteriorations in the terms 
of trade. This is consistent, for instance, with 
the fact that the Russian current account con -
tinues to record a surplus despite the plunging 
oil prices – not least because the country has 
imposed dramatic restrictions on imports.
It is not unusual for the elasticity of global trade 
to fluctuate. Particularly striking is the increase 
of this elasticity in the 1990s. Very long time 
series are needed to put this period into con -
text and examine its suitability as a reference 
measure. The WTO provides annual data on 
global output and real exports of goods start -
ing from 1950. When average global output 
growth and the trade elasticities are calculated 
for five-  year periods in each case, the elastici -
ties fluctuate between 1 and 2 almost without 
exception. The years 2011 to 2015 are also to 
be found within this band, with a value of 
1.4.41 The elasticity of 2 calculated for the 
period 1980 to 2007 is due, above all, to an 
unusually high figure in the first half of the 
1990s.42 Running counter to the usual cyclical 
pattern, trade in goods picked up substantially 
between 1991 and 1993, whereas output con -
tracted slightly. However, this period is likely to 
represent an anomaly because of major steps taken towards integration in Europe such as 
the creation of the single European market, the 
opening up of the former transition countries 
and the emergence of numerous new coun -
tries. But given the inclusion of large emerging 
market economies like China and India in the 
global economy, this could – to an extent – be 
true of later years as well. This would mean, 
however, that an elasticity level of 2 may be an 
excessively high yardstick.
All in all, there is much evidence to suggest 
that global trade is not inherently weak. At the 
end of the day, international trade in goods 
cannot build up much momentum as long as 
the industrial countries generate only compara -
tively weak economic growth. Given that the 
emerging market economies are likely to retain 
their growth lead, we can expect global trade 
to continue posting subdued growth in the 
years ahead. No economic policy action needs 
to be taken on this basis alone. Nevertheless, 
additional efforts to liberalise the markets could 
provide global trade with a key boost.Balance of

Technical annex
The empirical analysis drew on nominal and real an -
nual data for imports (goods and services), GDP , 
consumption and gross investment for 42 countries 
in the period from 1979 to 2015. The main source 
used was the World Bank’s World Development In -
dicators (WDI); the most recent data were added 
from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook  (WEO) of 
October 2015.43 In line with the IMF’s framework, 
the country group was subdivided into 24 advanced 
economies and 18 emerging market economies 
(EMEs).44 A number of EMEs for which there are no 
sufficiently long time series were dropped from the 
dataset. This particularly relates to EMEs in central 
and eastern Europe and in the Middle East. How -
ever, the sample contains major EMEs, including 
China, India, Indonesia and Brazil. In total, the sam -
ple represented approximately 84% of global eco -
nomic activity and 76% of global imports in 2014. 
As in the IMF’s approach, the national growth rates 
of the real variables were aggregated using nominal 
shares (always based on market exchange rates). 
The rates of change constructed in this way for the 
country group in question largely match the IMF’s 
data for the world as a whole. In particular, the sig -
nificant decline in aggregate trade elasticity since the 
period prior to the global financial and economic cri -
sis is traced, which means that the dataset is suitable 
for examining the relevant composition effects.
In economic theory, elasticity expresses the percent -
age by which a variable changes depending on the 
percentage change of another variable. Trade elasti -
city is understood here as the responsiveness of the 
trade volume (goods and services) to real GDP . We 
use price- adjusted imports owing to the closer rela -
tionship to domestic economic activity. A simple 
measure of elasticity is the ratio of the (average) 
growth rates for imports (M) and for GDP (Y) in real 
terms over a given period:
(1a) ⌘=M
M/Y
Y.
The rate of change in global imports is defined as 
the weighted sum of the corresponding growth 
rates for the individual countries (i = 1, …, q ); the 
shares in nominal imports (Mn) serve as weights. This 
means that elasticity at the global level can be ex -
pressed as
(1b) ⌘w=⇣Xq
i=1M i
MiMn
i
Mnw⌘
/Yw
YwExtending the numerator and denominator to each 
include the national rates of change in (real) GDP 
gives global trade elasticity as a weighted sum of 
national elasticities, with the weight of a given coun -
try determined by the product of its import share 
and its GDP growth in relation to the expansion of 
global economic activity:
(1c) ⌘w=Xqi=1⌘iMn
i
MnwYi
Yi/Yw
Yw .45
The national elasticities weighted in this way can be 
interpreted as contributions to global elasticity.
Since the ratio of rates of change in imports to GDP 
does not take into account the influence of other 
variables, especially relative prices, its usefulness is 
potentially limited. It is often simply referred to as 
apparent elasticity. In a scatter plot depicting the log 
of the levels of imports and economic activity, it cor -
responds to the incline of a straight line drawn 
through the start and end point of the observation 
period. Because the other observations ultimately do 
not play a role, a longer period should be selected 
for a representative ratio.
To fit a straight line to all observation points, use can 
be made (due to the cointegration of the variables) 
of a regression of the log of the levels (with a con -
stant α and ϵ as residual):
(2a) lnM t=↵+β·lnY t+✏t .
The coefficient β can then be interpreted directly as 
a measure of the incline, or elasticity. However, the 
long pre- crisis period selected here ensures that the Sample of

43 Since the IMF does not publish any time series on real 
gross investment, the nominal rates of change calculated 
from the available investment ratios were used for 2015, 
under the assumption that there were no relative price 
shifts. These data for 2015, in particular, should thus be 
treated with caution.

Brazil, Chile, China, Columbia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, 
 Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, 
South Africa, Thailand, Uruguay and Venezuela.

simple ratio of growth rates generally does not differ 
significantly from β.
The regression method can also take into account 
the influence of additional variables.46 Income elasti -
city and price elasticity of imports have traditionally 
been determined simultaneously using a regression 
of the log of the levels:
(2b) lnM t=↵+β·lnY t+γ·lnP t+✏t.
Here, P is taken as a measure of relative import 
prices, the selection of which is not trivial, how -
ever.47 If, as in Bussière et al (2013), the ratio of the 
deflators for imports and GDP is calculated, only 
limited price effects are revealed in the dataset used 
in this article. However, the discrepancies between 
the income elasticities estimated in equations (2a) 
and (2b) are also small.
The differences in the log of the levels or the rates of 
change in the variables can be analysed in place of 
the levels. Equation (2a) implies that import growth 
is explained solely by changes in income (and ran -
dom forces). A regression of rates of change only can pose problems, however, as the adjusted straight 
line has to pass through the origin. If a constant is

47 A fundamental work on the income elasticity of various 
countries’ trade flows is the study authored by Houthakker 
and Magee (1969), which is based on estimates in the form 
of equation (2b). The price measure they selected was the 
ratio of the import price index to the wholesale price index; 
the latter was used due to the unavailability of a price index 
for goods that compete with imports. The authors deliber -
ately discarded the option of using the GDP deflator as a 
reference measure, citing the influence of non- traded 
goods. Other studies have opted to use the readily avail -
able GDP deflators. In their export equations, Houthakker 
and Magee calculated the ratio of a country’s export prices 
to those of other exporting countries. From a global per -
spective, however, the price ratio between tradable and 
non- tradable goods is likely to be of particular importance. 
Kohli (1982) demonstrated the implications of different for -
mulations for the price elasticities of import demand and 
stressed that such price and volume effects are always de -
rived under certain ceteris paribus assumptions and should 
be interpreted accordingly. See H S Houthakker and S P

taken into account, however, the influence of trend 
growth will probably also be ascribed to this term. 
The regression coefficient for the rate of change of 
GDP then mainly reflects short- term, cyclical influ -
ences and is therefore comparatively high.
Error correction models combine this kind of formu -
lation of the short- term relationship with a long-  
term relationship of the levels. However, Ollivaud 
and Schwellnus (2015) point out that the long- term 
elasticity derived in this way is severely instable for 
short observation periods, as they argue the model 
cannot differentiate between short- term growth and 
the long- term relationship.48 Alternatively, short-  
term and long- term elasticities can be determined 
using a regression of the levels, which additionally 
takes account of lags in the variables and has favour -
able properties on the whole, according to Irwin 
(2002).49 In this way, the current slackness of world 
trade is explained to a certain extent by the preced -
ing weakness.
To depict the comparatively strong fluctuations in 
trade flows, variables behind the cyclical fluctuations 
in GDP could also be analysed. To do so, the first 
step was to determine the elasticity of goods im -
ports, in particular, in respect to industrial produc -
tion (IP)based on CPB data with the aid of regres -
sions in the same way as equation (2a):50
(3a) lnM t=↵+β·lnIP t+✏t .
Second, regressions were estimated according to 
equation (2b), which, instead of real GDP , used 
(price- adjusted) consumption (C) and gross invest -
ment (I) as explanatory variables:
(3b) lnM t=↵+β·lnC t+γ·lnI t+δ·lnP t+✏t.
However, the added explanatory contribution of this 
model is only revealed at the current end.51In all of these approaches, import growth ultimately 
cannot be wholly explained by changes in domestic 
activity variables. The method used by Stratford 
(2015) assumes perfect correlation, however. Specif -
ically, the rates of change in real GDP (y) are first 
standardised, which is to say they are adjusted for 
their mean (y–) and their standard deviation (σy):
(4a) yST
t=yt¯y
y .
The standardised GDP rates are then extrapolated 
using the mean (m–) and the standard deviation (σm) 
of the import rates to arrive at the adjusted rates as 
a reference measure for import growth:
(4b) yAD
t=m·yST
t+¯m .
The short- term elasticity of imports is thus influ -
enced by the (high) ratio of the standard deviations. 
It should be emphasised that this approach postu -
lates constant trend growth in imports. A downward 
deviation from this trend is always interpreted as a 
temporary phenomenon within the range of normal 
volatility, even if it actually represents a trend slow -
down in growth. Against this backdrop, it is ques -
tionable whether this approach is truly suited to ex -
plaining the persistent weakness of world trade.Elasticities in

and that could be used to construct relative prices were

51 One problem here could be posed by the changing im -
portance of components of gross investment, which differ 
considerably in terms of their import content. Construction 
investment, in particular, is likely to be relatively unimport -
ant to international trade. Furthermore, many countries 
now also count spending on intellectual property rights as 
investment. This expenditure has grown in importance in 
the advanced economies over the past few years.Deutsche Bundesbank

German balance of payments in 2015
The German economy’s current account surplus rose very strongly again in 2015, mainly due to 
a higher positive balance on cross- border trade in goods and services. It is likely that the foreign 
trade surplus, in particular, was strongly boosted by the short- term effects of lower prices for 
internationally traded commodities – most notably the steep drop in crude oil prices – and the 
depreciating euro. The lower commodity prices had a dampening effect on nominal imports, 
although the expected consequences of the pronounced shifts in income between producer coun -
tries and consumer countries have not yet become clearly apparent. In the medium term, the 
substantial revenue shortfalls sustained by the main commodity- producing countries will pose 
risks to German firms’ export chances, whereas low commodity prices should simultaneously 
 further strengthen Germany’s underlying domestic growth dynamics. The current account surplus, 
which amounted to 8½% of gross domestic product in 2015, therefore only provides a snapshot 
picture of the evolving situation.
German exports increased perceptibly in 2015 as a whole, despite slackening in the second half 
of the year. Significantly more goods were exported to the United States, the United Kingdom, 
Switzerland and to central and east European EU countries outside the euro area. German enter -
prises also benefited from the pick- up in economic activity in large parts of the euro area. Stronger 
growth in traditionally important sales markets more than offset weaker momentum in exports to 
emerging market economies of late compared with past years. Exports to China reflected the 
slowdown in Chinese growth, while sales to Russia fell again very steeply owing to the further 
deterioration in the country’s economic situation and the international sanctions.
Germany’s financial account with the rest of the world was influenced last year by the low-  
interest- rate environment and the Eurosystem’s large- scale purchases of securities for monetary 
policy reasons under the quantitative easing programme. On balance, Germany recorded net 
capital exports of €232 billion, which was slightly down on the 2014 level. Portfolio investment 
flows were heavily influenced by the sell- off of domestic debt securities by foreign investors; some 
of these securities were acquired by the Bundesbank as part of the expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme. German investors also showed reduced interest in foreign securities. Direct investment 
likewise saw capital outflows as German businesses continued to expand their international links 
significantly on balance. By contrast, other investment recorded net capital imports, with both 
enterprises and households and monetary financial institutions recording capital inflows. The 
Bundesbank’s external position expanded in 2015 owing to a considerable rise in Germany’s 
 TARGET2 balance. Asset purchases by the Eurosystem played a key role in this.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends  
in the current account
The German economy’s current account sur -
plus rose very sharply in 2015 to €257 billion, 
or 8½% of gross domestic product (GDP). At 
€44 billion, the year- on- year increase recorded 
during 2015 was twice as high as in 2014 
(+€22½ billion). On the one hand, this was be -
cause the value of the goods exported by Ger -
man enterprises rose considerably more than 
the total value of the goods imported by Ger -
many. On the other hand, the deficit on ser -vices narrowed distinctly, due largely to the 
considerable rise in revenue from industrial ser -
vices and the decline in foreign travel expend -
iture. The surplus from cross- border investment 
income went up moderately in 2015, which, 
given the renewed steep increase in net exter -
nal assets in 2015, indicates that income yields 
had a dampening effect. The traditional deficit 
in the secondary income account declined 
somewhat.
The increase in the current account surplus 
over the past two years to a new record high in 
post- war German history was caused primarily 
by the short- run effects of the pronounced 
changes in the external setting. Thus world 
market prices for crude oil, industrial commod -
ities and food, beverages and tobacco have 
fallen dramatically since mid-2014. This notice -
ably dampened the overall value of goods im -
ports because Germany mostly imports its en -
ergy inputs as well as a wide range of other 
important raw materials and agricultural goods. 
Between the second quarter of 2014 and the 
second quarter of 2015, the euro depreciated 
very strongly against the US dollar. While this 
partly offset the price fall in imported commod -
ities denominated in US dollars, it lifted the 
trade balance by a larger margin by improving 
the sales prospects for German products in 
markets outside the euro area, especially as the 
euro also lost value during this period against 
other major currencies such as the pound, the 
renminbi and, later on, the Swiss franc. Simula -
tions indicate that the expansion of the surplus 
in trade in goods and services seen in 2014 and 
2015 was due chiefly to the short- term effects 
of the drop in crude oil prices and the euro’s 
depreciation (for further details, see the box on 
pages 39 to 41).
The exchange rate changes may be expected 
to have a knock-  on effect in the near future. 
However, countervailing forces to Germany’s 
export surplus are likely to gain the upper hand 
at least in the medium term. For example, the

The impact of the steep fall in oil prices and the euro 
 depreciation on the expansion of Germany’s current  account surplus in 2014 and 2015
For many years now, the exceptionally high 
current account surplus has been at the 
centre of economic policy discussion con-
cerning the possible existence of macroeco-nomic imbalances in Germany. Two key de-
terminants can be held responsible for the 
renewed very sharp expansion of the sur-plus that has occurred over the past two 
years, these being the plummeting prices of 
internationally traded commodities (espe-
cially crude oil) and the depreciation of the 
euro exchange rate, both of which repre-sent changes in the external environment. 
However, this period was also characterised by intensifi  ed domestic growth momentum, 
largely on the back of buoyant consump-tion activity. On the one hand, this was 
prompted by home- grown factors such as 
the positive labour market situation and 
marked wage growth. On the other hand, 
gains in real income also played a role in connection with the fall in oil prices. This 
illustrates that it is wise to heed how factors interact in this context.
The current account balance refl  ects a 
multitude of infl  uences delivered via a range of different transmission channels. It makes 
analytical sense to quantify individual as-pects, not least in terms of evaluating the magnitude and timing of these effects. At 
the same time, such information should be 
considered in the overall context and it is useful when making an assessment to gauge whether any changes in the deter-minants are of a temporary or permanent 
nature. From a theoretical perspective, tem-
porary shocks should not permanently af-fect the size of the current account bal-
ance.1
An initial descriptive insight can be obtained 
from breaking down changes in the Ger-man foreign trade balance into price and volume effects. While terms- of- trade ef-fects do not seem to diminish or expand the surplus in the long term, mathematic-ally the increase in the foreign trade bal-
ance over the past two years can be attrib-
uted almost entirely to ongoing improve-
ments in the real terms of trade. Moreover, in macroeconomic terms, price effects have 
consistently favoured additional net rev-
enue from foreign trade activity during the past three years. Conversely, in terms of vol-ume, allowance may have been made for a

small decline in the German foreign trade 
balance.
Simulations using the Bundesbank’s macro-
econometric model go one step further.2 
Here, it is possible to quantify the individual 
contributions of the drop in oil prices and 
the euro depreciation to the change in the 
German surplus on the basis of cross- border trade in goods and services, taking account 
of price transmission mechanisms and the consequences for the domestic economy. 
To this end, actual developments are com-
pared with scenarios where from mid-2014 
onwards crude oil prices and exchange 
rates are extrapolated in line with that fac-
tor’s average level over the previous six 
quarters.
Up to and including the second quarter of 
2014, crude oil had been trading at a rela-tively constant price level of around US$110 
per barrel (Brent crude). During the course 
of the subsequent drop in prices, which 
was mainly fuelled by increased production, crude oil prices declined by just under 30% by the fourth quarter of 2014 and by a total 
of 60% by the fi  nal quarter of 2015, com-
pared with their starting level. Meanwhile, 
given the expectations of a continued ac-commodative monetary policy stance and 
the measures decided by the ECB Govern-
ing Council in December 2014, the euro de-
preciated sharply, both in bilateral terms 
against the US dollar and in nominal effect-
ive terms.3 Starting at a rate of US$1.3 for 
one euro, the bilateral exchange rate sank 
by more than 5% by the end of 2014, and by just under 20% by the end of 2015, not 
least on account of the sharp depreciation 
in the fi  rst quarter of that year. Measured 
against the currencies of the euro area’s 19 
most important trading partners, the euro 
lost just under 10% of its value by the end of 2015.
According to the results of the simulation 
calculations, the two examined factors ac-tually only played a fairly minor role in the 
rise in the current account surplus from 6¾% to 7¼% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014. Mathematically, the contri-bution made to this increase by falling oil 
prices taken in isolation was one- tenth of a 
percentage point. Compared with the out-
come of the decomposition, aside from the 
broader reference to goods and services 
fl  ows, it is noteworthy that the calculations 
made for the simulations did not factor in 
the effects of the fall in the price of non- 
energy- generating commodities, which was 
also substantial.4 Bearing in mind the time 
lags that arise with exchange rate changes, it is in fact hardly surprising that the depre-
ciation of the euro had no signifi  cant im-pact on the expansion of the current ac-
count balance in 2014.
By contrast, in 2015 the two external fac-
tors in question had a strong expansionary effect overall, with falling oil prices making 
a contribution of ¾ of a percentage point 
and the euro depreciation ¼ of a percent-
age point to the rise in the current account 
balance from a level of 7¼% to 8½% of GDP . First and foremost, falling oil prices 
lead to cheaper oil imports and are less in-clined to boost the size of demand as Ger-
man energy imports exhibit a relatively 
small degree of price elasticity.5 On the one 
2 The macroeconometric model is a key instrument for 
generating the projection baseline and is used for ac-
companying simulation calculations. It is a traditional 
macro model with Keynesian properties in the short 
term and neoclassical properties in the long term. The estimates of the behavioural equations are updated on 
the basis of seasonally adjusted quarterly data at six-

3 Strictly speaking, the euro had already depreciated 
slightly in the second quarter of 2014. To aid compari-son, the hypothetical scenarios both for the price of oil 
and for the exchange rate are analysed on a uniform 
basis from the third quarter of 2014 onwards.4 This is also indicated by evidence that only one- fi  fth 
of the improvement in the real terms of trade wit-nessed in 2014 can be attributed to the modelled 
shocks.

imports are estimated as having a price elasticity of 0.2 to 0.3.Deutsche Bundesbank

hand, the depreciation of the euro stimu-
lates exports. On the other hand, it results 
in import substitution and, according to the 
simulation fi  ndings for 2015, the restraining infl  uence of this substitution virtually offsets 
the import- augmenting effect of the add-
itionally boosted domestic economic activ-
ity caused by lower crude oil prices. Beside the direct effects on German external trade, 
account is also taken of spillover effects arising from the stimulation of exports in 
other euro- area countries. These effects ac-counted for just over one- tenth of the esti-
mated contribution of the euro depreci-
ation in 2015.
The results are consistent with comparable 
simulations conducted by the European 
Commission.6 Nevertheless, there are some 
uncertainties that merit consideration. First, the estimates depend on the model specifi  -
cation. In the case of the oil price simula-tion, for instance, account is taken of the 
fact that, since the mineral oil tax is charged 
as a volume- based tax, the effects of oil price changes hinge on the starting price. 
Conversely, no attention is paid to the ori-
ginally non- linear effects of the oil price on macroeconomic activity, which would seem likely, especially given the magnitude of the 
shock. With respect to the shock to the nominal effective euro exchange rate, it should be noted that the extent of currency depreciation can vary depending on the size 
of the group of countries under examin-ation. The estimated contribution of the euro depreciation is therefore likely to be somewhat smaller when compared with the currencies of Germany’s 39 most im-
portant trading partners.
Second, the model simulations present the 
effects of isolated shocks, ie none of the other model- exogenous variables react to 
changes in the external setting. In this con-text, the fact that, in particular, no account 
is taken of any interaction between falling 
oil prices or the euro depreciation and the 
expansion of German exporters’ sales mar-kets outside the euro area is no major short-
coming in view of the short simulation 
period under examination. Greater caution 
is warranted when interpreting the results 
for the current year and beyond. Neverthe-
less, it is likely that the effects of the ex-change rate movements had not yet had 
their full impact by the end of 2015.

ing excessive swings in both directions that fre -
quently occur in speculative markets, may indi -
cate that the long- term price paths of these 
goods will not be as steep as expected a few 
years ago.1 The price corrections are leading to 
significant income losses in the main producer 
countries which, together with the slowdown 
in these countries’ growth rates, will tend to 
curb the export opportunities for German firms, 
which are often well positioned in these sales 
markets. At the same time, lower commodity 
prices strengthen Germany’s domestic growth 
dynamics. As well as boosting domestic de -
mand, a prolonged reduction in the price level 
would also be expected to create supply and capacity effects. This could well lead to in -
creased corporate investment and higher de -
mand for intermediate goods. These are com -
ponents that may be assumed to have a rela -
tively high import intensity, also in comparison 
to private consumption.
Given the significant contribution of the much 
cheaper commodity prices and the depreciat -
ing euro to explaining the increase in the cur -
rent account balance, it is not surprising that 
Germany’s surplus vis- à- vis non- euro- area 
countries rose further. In 2015, the income 
generated in Germany’s current account from 
transactions with countries outside the euro 
area exceeded the corresponding expenditure 
by €194 billion, or 6½% of GDP . The balance 
vis- à- vis the euro- area states, which after peak -
ing in 2007 slumped during the next six years 
from 4¼% to 1¼% of GDP in the wake of the 
financial and sovereign debt crisis as well as the 
resulting structural adjustment processes, rose 
again noticeably over the past two years; in 
2015, a positive difference of 2% of GDP was 
posted. Economic activity in many euro- area 
partner countries strengthened, boosting de -
mand for German products. Exporters were 
aided not only by the fact that in these coun -
tries the distribution structures are firmly estab -
lished and customers are familiar with product 
features, but also because price competitive -
ness has not suffered appreciably under the 
marked growth of unit labour costs in Ger -
many. Accordingly, although the indicator 
based on the deflators of total sales shows a 
deterioration compared with 2012, Germany’s 
competitive position has remained better than 
the long- run average.Higher surplus

1 This inference is based on the logic that, partly owing to 
the sharp rise in the price of crude oil over the last decade, 
producers have sought new sources of crude oil and de -
veloped corresponding extraction technologies (such as 
fracking). The resulting increase in the supply of generally 
profitably extractable crude oil deposits will probably have 
a dampening effect on the long- run price path of crude oil.

Goods flows and balance 
of trade
German foreign trade grew very dynamically 
overall in 2015 despite weakening in the 
second half of the year. Nominal goods exports 
were up by 6½% on average over the year 
compared with 2014. In real terms, the in -
crease in exports amounted to 5½%. Goods 
imports rose by 4¼% in nominal terms. How -
ever, price effects caused by the decline in 
world market prices on the commodities mar -
kets, especially for crude oil, have been re -
straining German import expenditure since 
2012. In real terms, Germany’s goods imports 
expanded by an estimated 7% in the period 
under review. As a result, the foreign trade sur -
plus grew by €34 billion to reach a new record 
high of €247½ billion. In purely mathematical 
terms, however, the further expansion of Ger -
many’s foreign trade balance over the last three 
years was due almost entirely to improvements 
in the terms of trade; in fact, there was a mod -
erate decline in terms of volume.
Foreign trade with countries in the European 
Union (EU) expanded relatively dynamically, as 
was also the case in 2014. Exports to EU coun -
tries outside the euro area, in particular, 
showed above- average growth. Sales to cen -
tral and east European EU countries went up by 
one- tenth, for instance, while exports to the 
United Kingdom rose by as much as one-  
eighth. Furthermore, trade with the euro area 
picked up significantly in 2015. Exports rose by 
5% on the back of the economic recovery, 
mainly due to the revival in the sales of new 
cars and growing investment in the euro area. 
Pent-up demand was met in these areas, espe -
cially in the (former) programme countries with 
the exception of Greece. Demand for German 
goods also rose very steeply in the Netherlands 
and Italy. Growth in exports to France and Aus -
tria, by contrast, was comparatively small.
Earnings from exports to countries outside the 
European Union were 5½% higher in 2015 
than in 2014, when exports had increased only Very dynamic

moderately. Given the muted pace of overall 
global economic growth, this may have owed 
something to the euro’s depreciation since the 
beginning of 2014. Another factor is that eco -
nomic activity in traditionally important extra-  
European sales market was relatively buoyant. 
Strong stimuli came from the United States, in 
particular, which became Germany’s foremost 
export partner as a result. Prior to this France 
had been the biggest importer of German 
goods for more than 50 years without a break. 
Exports to other advanced economies such as 
Switzerland and the newly industrialised econ -
omies in Asia were also brisk, while deliveries 
of goods to Japan continued to stagnate at 
their 2012 level. Exports to China in 2015 were 
down on the year for the first time in 20 years 
owing to the deceleration in growth there. 
Sanctions and the ongoing recession in Russia 
meant that German sales to that country de -
creased for the third consecutive year, this time 
by just over one- quarter. By contrast, exports to 
the south and east Asian emerging market 
economies made a significant positive contri -
bution to growth. Furthermore, exports to the 
OPEC member states increased substantially in 
2015, as they had done in 2014; the appre -
ciably restricted leeway for petrodollar recyc -
ling of late does not seem to have had an im -
pact so far.Earnings from exports rose in all major categor -
ies of goods in 2015. Consumer goods re -
corded the largest increase again, due mainly 
to dynamic sales growth in pharmaceutical 
products, which have come to play a more im -
portant role in German exports over the past 
few years thanks chiefly to flourishing sales 
markets in the United States, the United King -
dom and the Netherlands. Exports of capital 
goods also expanded strongly during the 
period under observation. Despite a slide in car 
sales to China, automotive exports again made 
a comparatively large contribution to this 
growth as German vehicle manufacturers 
achieved higher sales, in particular, in the 
United States, the United Kingdom and the 
euro- area countries. Even when looking at the 
quarterly pattern, no visible dip is discernible in 
Germany’s automobile exports overall in 2015 
in the wake of the Volkswagen group’s emis -
sions scandal. Turnover of computer, electronic 
and optical products also showed significant 
growth, while exports of machinery recorded 
only a small rise.
Buoyant domestic demand in Germany led to a 
broadly based rise in imports in all major cat -
egories of goods. The favourable labour market 
situation and the accompanying large increase 
in real disposable income were reflected in 
considerable growth in imports of consumer …… as well to

goods. In addition, Germany once again im -
ported significantly more capital goods in 2015. 
For one thing, this was due to rapid growth in 
import expenditure on vehicles, which is pre -
sumably related both to cross- border value 
chains with central and eastern European coun -
tries and to higher relative prices in the wake of 
the depreciating euro, especially against the US 
dollar. For another thing, the increase in do -
mestic investment in machinery and equipment 
was mirrored in considerably higher imports of 
machines, computers, electronic and optical 
products in 2015. By contrast, nominal energy 
imports decreased by one- fifth owing to falling 
oil prices, which significantly slowed the overall 
increase in import expenditure. In real terms, 
however, energy imports are likely to have risen 
noticeably in 2015 following the extremely mild 
winter in 2014.
As in 2014, suppliers from euro- area countries 
only moderately increased their sales in Ger -
many. Exporters from outside the euro area, on 
the other hand, benefited more from Germa -
ny’s brisker domestic demand. By contrast, the 
decline in energy imports from Russia and the 
OPEC member states accelerated distinctly. Im -
ports from these countries dropped by a fur -
ther one- fifth and one- third, respectively, from 
their already low prior- year levels. Imports from 
the United Kingdom remained lacklustre. In 
contrast to this, imports from Switzerland, 
Japan and the United States recorded sharp in -
creases in 2015 following faltering growth in 
the previous year, with sales from the USA ris -
ing by as much as one- fifth.2 Chinese products 
continued to be in brisk demand. Led by motor 
vehicles, import payments to central and east -
ern European countries expanded very strongly, 
just as they had done in the past years. Imports 
from the newly industrialised Asian countries 
and the south and east Asian emerging market 
economies likewise went up in 2015.
The contribution of goods trade to the current 
account rose by €36½ billion and thus by a 
somewhat larger margin than foreign trade. 
The surplus for 2015 came to €263 billion.3 The value of goods purchased and sold in mer -
chanting transactions has risen sharply over the 
last few years owing to the growing inter -
national cross- holdings of German multination -
als. For instance, merchanting trade in motor 
vehicles, which makes up just under half of the 
gross amounts, recorded significant growth in 
both receipts and expenditure in 2015. Overall, 
the surplus from merchanting trade went up 
only slightly to €22½ billion.
Breakdown of invisibles
Germany’s cross- border services balance, which 
traditionally posts a large deficit, stood at minus 
€30 billion in 2015. This was €5 billion smaller 
than the 2014 deficit. The improvement was 
due chiefly to the substantial rise in income, 
which exceeded the increase in expenditure on 
services provided by non- residents. The particu -
larly dynamic growth in exports of services to 
non- euro- area countries is likely to stem, on 
the one hand, from the favourable economic 
situation in major recipient countries of indus -
trial services (such as the United States and the 
United Kingdom). In addition, exchange rate 
effects may also have had an impact.
There was higher foreign demand for IT ser -
vices from German suppliers, in particular, in 
2015 than in 2014. An increase was likewise 
registered in income from intellectual property 
licences as well as from research and develop -
ment. Germany is recording sizeable surpluses Euro- area sup-

Only small rise

Improvement 
due mainly to some industrial services
2 The sharp increase in nominal imports from the United 
States and Switzerland may have been due partly to the 
fact that, in the case of contractually fixed selling prices in 
US dollars or Swiss francs, the import price of the goods 
went up simply on account of currency translation. An -
other conceivable factor is that demand for particular 
goods from these countries is relatively inelastic, at least in 
the short term.
3 Trade in goods differs from foreign trade in that there are 
additions and subtractions on both the export and import 
side which are caused by goods flows to and from ware -
houses and cross- border commission processing. A second 
difference is that imports do not include the costs of trans -
port and insurance from the supplier’s border to the border 
with Germany (known as cif import costs), but do take into 
account net income from merchanting trade and transac -
tions involving non- monetary gold.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
March 2016

in areas such as these, in which the inter -
national division of labour is gaining ground. 
There were improvements, too, in the balance 
of maintenance and repair services. The fact 
that this sub- account tends to show a deficit 
should be seen in the context of German goods 
exporters’ warranty obligations, particularly 
those of car manufacturers. Professional and 
management consultancy services – also in -
cluding commercial services, which have re -
corded a deficit for a long time – commissions, 
technical services and other services continued 
to show marked deficits. The deficit in the 
cross- border exchange of transport services 
contracted slightly in 2015 after having ex -
panded in the past few years.
Residents spent 2% less on foreign travel in 
2015 than in 2014. This marks the first decline 
since the crisis year of 2009. The substantial in -
come increases evidently did not lead to an in -
crease in travel abroad. The breakdown of for -
eign travel by country suggests that the depre -
ciation of the euro played at least some part in 
this. Hence expenditure on travel to Switzer -
land fell by one- third in 2015, while spending 
on trips to the United States was down by just 
over one- fifth. Destinations in Asia, by contrast, 
proved more popular. A slight rise in revenue 
coupled with lower spending trimmed the def -
icit in the travel sub- account from €37½ billion 
in 2014 to €35½ billion in the year under re -
view.
Germany accumulated a surplus of €63½ bil -
lion from cross- border primary income in 2015. 
This item largely comprises net receipts from 
investment income, which increased by just €2 
billion last year. Given the ongoing strong ex -
pansion of Germany’s net foreign assets, the 
rather moderate growth suggests that returns 
had a dampening effect. On the one hand, this 
reflects a further fall in the general yield level. 
On the other hand, current data indicate a con -
tinuing normalisation, as already observed in 
2013 and 2014, of the yield spread between 
assets and liabilities after it had widened starkly 
in favour of German net investment in the aftermath of the financial and sovereign debt 
crisis.4 The increase in income stemmed from 
higher receipts from direct investment and 
portfolio investment, while interest income fell, 
as it has done in recent years. On the expend -
iture side, direct investment and portfolio in -
vestment by non- residents caused only slightly 
higher outlays, and interest expenditure fell 
again noticeably.
The secondary income balance closed in 2015 
with a deficit of €39½ billion. This was slightly 
smaller than the figure recorded in 2014. The 
perceptible rise in transfers to the rest of the 
world was due to a sizeable increase in private- 
sector transfers. By contrast, government trans -
fers to international institutions which are not 
directly reciprocated – including contributions 
to the EU budget – fell slightly. Private- sector 
receipts likewise increased; the bulk of these 
are insurance premiums paid to German re -
insurers. Transfers to the government sector 
from the rest of the world were only marginally 
higher in 2015 than in 2014.
Financial transactions
Underlying trends in financial 
transactions
In 2015, Germany’s current account surplus 
was mirrored by high net capital exports (€232 
billion).5 This was chiefly attributable to port -
folio investment, which was mainly shaped by 
the low- interest- rate environment and the large 
volumes of securities purchased for monetary 
policy purposes under the quantitative easing 
(QE) programme. In light of the low and in part 
negative bond yields in Germany, foreign in -
vestors offloaded German fixed- income secur -
ities on a large scale on balance, but increased Fall in foreign 
travel spending

their demand for domestic equities. Resident 
investors showed less interest in foreign secur -
ities in 2015 compared with 2014. Given lower 
yields, they notably bought fewer debt secur -
ities. By contrast, they invested to a greater ex -
tent in foreign shares. Direct investment also 
saw capital outflows as German businesses 
continued to expand their international invest -
ment on balance. Conversely, Germany re -
corded net capital imports in other investment. 
Here, enterprises and households as well as 
monetary financial institutions recorded inflows 
of funds. The Bundesbank posted a strong in -
crease in its TARGET2 receivables, which were 
mirrored by higher deposits from foreign in -
vestors.
Portfolio investment
In portfolio investment, which often clearly re -
flects developments in the international finan -
cial markets, net capital exports amounted to 
€199 billion in 2015, compared with €137½ 
billion in 2014. This increase was mainly attrib -
utable to a turnaround in foreign demand for 
German securities. While non- resident invest -
ors purchased German securities on balance in 
2014, they sold German portfolio assets in 
2015.
Non- resident investors mainly sold longer- term 
debt securities (€98 billion, compared with pur -
chases to the tune of €15 billion in 2014). A 
major contributory factor in this is likely to have 
been the expanded asset purchase programme 
(EAPP). Under this programme, the Eurosystem 
purchases mainly European government bonds; 
as a result, their yields fell sharply, especially at 
the beginning of 2015 and again in the second 
half of the year following a brief counterswing 
in the second quarter. For prolonged spells Ger -
man federal bonds (Bunds) recorded negative 
yields for maturities of up to seven years.

March 2015 – and sold bonds and notes worth 
€79 billion net over the year as a whole. The 
Bundesbank is likely to have acquired a consid -
erable proportion of these assets. As well as in -
vestors from Europe, Chinese bondholders also 
noticeably reduced their stocks of German gov -
ernment bonds in 2015. However, monetary 
policy motives also probably played a large role 
in these sales.
The trend towards the sale of long- term bonds 
issued by the private sector seen in previous 
years continued. Non-  resident investors sold 
German private- sector debt securities for €19 
billion (2014: €14 billion). Besides lower yields 
and Pfandbrief purchases under the EAPP , this 
may also have been due to net redemptions by 
private issuers. In particular, the outstanding 
volume of bank debt securities continued to 
decline. By contrast, domestic enterprises took 
advantage of the favourable financing condi -
tions in 2015 to further increase their capital 
market debt, including to non- residents.By comparison, holdings of domestic money 
market paper in foreign investors’ portfolios 
rose by €7 billion in 2015. Non- resident invest -
ors solely purchased securities issued by the pri -
vate sector (€20½ billion) whereas, as in the 
preceding two years, they sold government 
paper on balance (€13½ billion), which was 
not particularly attractive as the yields were 
clearly in negative territory.
Foreign demand for German shares also picked 
up again in 2015. On the back of higher turn -
over than in the previous year, inflows of funds 
amounted to €10½ billion in 2015 (2014: €5 
billion). This was reflected in addition in the 
relatively good share price performance of Ger -
man stocks in comparison to foreign equities. 
Demand from the rest of the world for domes -
tic investment fund units reversed. While non- 
resident investors had reduced their shares in 
German mutual funds by €5 billion in 2014, 
capital imports of €5½ billion were recorded in 
2015.
In the reverse direction, German investors ac -
quired foreign securities worth €124 billion net 
in 2015, which constituted a year- on- year 
decrease  (2014: €149 billion). Long- term debt 
securities are traditionally the most popular 
form of cross- border investment by domestic 
investors in this context. German investors pur -
chased foreign bonds worth €74 billion last 
year. While their holdings of euro- denominated 
bonds increased less strongly than in the pre -
ceding years, they stepped up their investment 
in foreign currency bonds, with bonds denom -
inated in US dollar and pound sterling being 
particularly sought after. Asymmetries in the 
monetary policy stance of the currency areas in 
question may well have been a factor in this. 
Whereas the bond purchase programmes in 
the United Kingdom and the United States had 
already come to an end before the start of 
2015, and the Federal Reserve raised interest 
rates in December 2015 for the first time since 
the crisis, the Eurosystem decided to introduce 
several additional monetary easing measures.

in exchange rate shifts to the detriment of the 
euro.
Given the very low (and sometimes negative) 
yields on European short- dated bonds, domes -
tic investors sold off foreign money market 
paper on balance last year (€5 billion). Their 
interest in short- term debt securities issued in 
other currency areas was not sufficient to com -
pensate for their sales of money market paper 
from European countries.
By contrast, there was a significant rise in do -
mestic investors’ demand for foreign shares. 
Overall, they purchased €19½ billion worth of 
them. This is presumably attributable to general 
portfolio shifts from fixed-  income assets to 
dividend- bearing paper. Domestic investors re -
corded a strong increase in their holdings of 
shares issued by euro- area member states as 
well as by the Anglo-  Saxon countries.
Furthermore, they supplemented their indirect 
investment in securities through foreign invest -
ment funds, namely in the amount of €35½ 
billion (2014: €41½ billion). In almost all cases, 
this took the form of purchasing mutual fund 
shares from other euro- area countries, where 
the majority of investment funds selling shares 
in Germany are based.
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments) 
recorded net capital exports of €26 billion in 
2015 (2014: €32 billion). Forward and futures 
contracts accounted for three- quarters of the 
net capital exports, while the remaining quarter 
was mainly attributable to options. Forward 
and futures contracts relating to electricity and 
gas played only a minor role in the reporting 
year. Credit institutions and other financial 
intermediaries were the main domestic coun -
terparties for cross- border financial derivatives.Direct investment
In a global environment of moderate growth 
and given various country- specific determin -
ants, international direct investment flows rose 
significantly in 2015. According to preliminary 
estimates by the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), cross-  
border direct investment rose more sharply in 
2015 than it has done in any other year since 
the outbreak of the financial crisis.6 The esti -
mated aggregate total of US$1.7 trillion would 
represent a year- on- year rise of 36%. How -
ever, there were marked regional disparities in 
the direction and intensity of foreign invest -
ment. The increase was driven, in particular, by 
a sharp inflow of funds to advanced econ -
omies, which saw almost a twofold rise in in -
bound foreign direct investment (FDI) com -
pared with 2014. The growing number of 
cross- border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) 
also played a major role in this context. In an 
environment of low interest rates and high 
liquid  assets, it would seem that many multi -
national enterprises pursued a strategy of 
growth through purchases. Direct investors 
were also strongly attracted again in 2015 to 
Asian emerging market economies, where FDI 
flows were up by 15½% on the year and ac -
counted for around one- third of global direct 
investment. By contrast, foreign investors 
showed little interest in 2015 in emerging mar -
ket economies or transforming economies in 
other regions. Especially commodity- exporting 
countries such as Russia, Brazil and Australia 
recorded sharp falls in their inflows of funds 
from the rest of the world.
The special role that EU countries and the 
United States played in global direct investment 
flows last year, according to UNCTAD esti -
mates, was also reflected in Germany’s direct 
investment relationships with the rest of the 
world. Germany’s direct investment in 2015

€56½ billion. This was attributable to intensive 
investment abroad by domestic enterprises, 
 although substantial funds simultaneously 
flowed into Germany in the shape of direct in -
vestment. The topping-up of equity capital 
played a major role in Germany’s cross- border 
transactions in 2015.
At €98 billion, direct investment abroad by do -
mestic enterprises once again clearly exceeded 
the already high prior- year figure of €85½ bil -
lion. German firms primarily invested in foreign 
equity stakes (€69½ billion).7 German cross-  
border equity holdings were substantially 
boosted both by new investments and the re -
investment of profits generated abroad. These 
transactions can partly be attributed to the 
aforementioned M&A- based corporate growth 
strategy for 2015, but the building and expan -
sion of production sites was also a significant 
factor. Domestic enterprises provided funds 
abroad in the amount of €28½ billion via intra- 
group credit transactions. This constitutes an 
increase of just over €9 billion compared with 
2014 and was also a rather large rise in a multi- 
year view. German parent companies, in par -
ticular, granted their foreign subsidiaries (pre -
dominantly short- term) loans. With regard to 
Germany’s external assets, just over one- fifth of 
all German claims on the rest of the world stem 
from direct investment. This share has fluctu -
ated only slightly over the last 15 years.
In terms of the fairly long-  term nature of their 
direct investment abroad, German enterprises 
are pursuing various strategic objectives. Ac -

Deutsche Bundesbank7 This is supported by data from Thomson One (Thomson 
Reuters), which indicate that, at €54 billion, the level of 
German firms’ cross- border M&A transactions in 2015 was 
on a par with the prior- year figure. However, the number 
of transactions fell by just under one- quarter to 82, which 
points to a greater average volume per transaction. This 
relates to completed M&A deals in which the purchaser

setting up sales and customer services (this was 
the case for 46% of the surveyed enterprises).8 
Furthermore, investing in foreign production 
sites in order to access markets (response given 
by 31% of the companies) remained a key fac -
tor in 2015. In addition, more enterprises than 
in previous years (23%) stated that they invest 
in production abroad on cost grounds. Accord -
ing to the survey, many firms consider that the 
trend in German labour costs is posing a risk to 
their profitability. However, electricity prices in 
Germany are also given as a persistent reason 
for seeking cheaper production facilities abroad. 
Moreover, the shortage of skilled labour as well 
as the overall economic policy setting were 
listed as factors by many enterprises.
Given this strategic motivation, German firms 
invest globally across multiple countries in all 
regions. However, their direct investment rela -
tionships with other EU countries are particu -
larly intense. First, these constitute important 
sales markets for German products, and, 
second, the production processes within Eur -
ope are often interlinked across borders. In 
2015, more than half of German outbound dir -
ect investment flowed to this group of coun -
tries. Looking at the individual target countries, 
the increase in German equity capital was par -
ticularly strong in Luxembourg (€10 billion), the 
Netherlands (€8½ billion) and the United King -
dom (€3 billion). Outside of Europe, too, do -
mestic enterprises provided their foreign com -
panies with more equity capital. This was the 
case in the United States (€17½ billion) and 
China (€4 billion), in particular. Just under one- 
third of all new cross- border equity investments 
were made by financial and insurance service 
providers. Another third of new investments 
were attributable to enterprises in the manu -
facturing sector, first and foremost suppliers in 
the automotive industry. And just under one-  
third was invested by companies that provide 
professional and technical services.
Through intra- group credit transactions, Ger -
man parent companies granted subsidiaries in 
other EU countries loans in the amount of €15 billion. Outside of Europe, they granted add -
itional loans to their US branches, in particular 
(€4 billion). Overall, while German outbound 
FDI in 2015 was broadly based in regional 
terms, there was a clear focus on advanced 
economies.
Non- resident investors stepped up their in -
volvement in Germany again in 2015, following 
very restrained foreign direct investment in 
Germany in 2014. Foreign investors provided 
German enterprises with funds amounting to 
€41½ billion last year. Specifically, they pro -
vided German enterprises with additional 
equity capital of €18½ billion. Furthermore, 
enterprises  in Germany received €23 billion in 
funds through intra- group credit. Loans ac -
counted for the lion’s share, primarily in the 
form of reverse flows by which a subsidiary 
domiciled abroad grants a loan to a direct in -
vestor in the home country.9 The data probably 
also partly reflect a type of maturity transform -
ation, whereby German enterprises repaid 
long- term loans previously granted by subsid -
iaries, while at the same time taking up new 
short- term loans from them.Regional struc-

The close cross- border links of corporate 
groups within Europe are also reflected in the 
regional structure of foreign direct investors in 
Germany. Around 60% of the inflows in 2015 
stemmed from EU countries. Especially large 
contributions were made by the United King -
dom (€7 billion), the Netherlands (€6 billion) 
and Austria (€4½ billion). Swiss investors also 
substantially expanded their interest in Ger -
many (€6 billion). Enterprises headquartered in 
the United States upped their presence in Ger -
many last year on a particularly large scale, 
with direct investment totalling €11½ billion. 
On the one hand, they provided additional 
equity capital to German enterprises, and, on 
the other, they above all increased their lending 
to affiliated enterprises in Germany – this also 
primarily took the form of loans granted by US 
subsidiaries to their parent companies in Ger -
many. The international investment position 
data show that in the third quarter of 2015 just 
under one-  fifth of all German liabilities to the 
rest of the world resulted from inbound FDI.
Other investment
Other investment, comprising loans and trade 
credits (where these do not constitute direct in -
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other assets, saw net capital imports of €47 billion in 
2015.
Non- banks received foreign funds worth €28½ 
billion net last year. This was almost exclusively 
due to transactions by enterprises and house -
holds. They ran down their balances with for -
eign banks (€13 billion) and took up more loans 
abroad (€10½ billion). By contrast, inbound 
and outbound transactions by general govern -
ment roughly balanced each other out over the 
year in net terms. On the one hand, public in -
stitutions reduced their unsecuritised liabilities 
to foreign creditors. On the other hand, they 
scaled back both their claims arising from long- 
term loans and their bank deposits abroad.
In the banking system as a whole, the net in -
flows of funds amounted to €18½ billion. This 
was attributable to the net capital imports of 
monetary financial institutions (excluding the 
Bundesbank) in the amount of €49 billion. Ger -
man credit institutions primarily reduced their 
interbank loans to the rest of the world. Con -
versely – albeit to a lesser extent – foreign de -
positors also decreased their deposits at Ger -
man credit institutions. The Bundesbank’s ex -
ternal position rose by €30½ billion in 2015 on 
account of transactions. This was predomin -
antly driven by higher claims within the 
TARGET2  payment system (€123½ billion). The 
increase in the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 balance 
is likely to be connected in part to the Eurosys -
tem’s asset purchase programmes that were 
launched in autumn 2014 and spring 2015 (see 
the box on pages 53 to 55). This was set 
against a significant rise in the Bundesbank’s 
external liabilities (by €93 billion), which was 
due to foreign investors – particularly the Euro -
pean Stability Mechanism – increasing their de -
posits. Moreover, inflows of funds arose from 
cross- border transactions involving euro bank -
notes.10Biggest investors

 The impact of Eurosystem securities purchases 
on the TARGET2 balances
In March 2015, the Eurosystem expanded 
its existing purchase programmes for asset- 
backed securities (ABSPP) and covered 
bonds (CBPP3) that had been up and run-
ning since the autumn of 2014 through the 
addition of a public sector purchase pro-
gramme (PSPP). The purpose of this new 
programme is to purchase bonds issued by euro- area central governments as well as by 
agencies and supranational European insti-
tutions.1 These purchases are made by na-
tional central banks (NCBs), in line with 
their respective stakes in the capital of the 
ECB, and by the ECB itself. The total pur-chase volume of the expanded asset pur-chase programme (EAPP) amounted to 
roughly €60 billion per month in 2015, with the PSPP thus far accounting for the bulk of acquisitions at around 85% of this total.
Liquidity provision via the various purchase 
programmes has elevated the amount of excess liquidity in the Eurosystem (see the 
adjacent chart). At the same time, the sum 
total of TARGET2 claims/TARGET2 liabilities 
in the Eurosystem has risen sharply again 
(up by €200 billion in the course of 2015). It 
is therefore reasonable to assume that the 
recorded increase in the TARGET2 balances might be connected with the EAPP .
The impact of the aforementioned purchase 
programmes on the TARGET2 balances can 
be subdivided into direct and indirect ef-fects. A direct effect is triggered whenever 
an NCB buys securities from a commercial 
bank participating in TARGET2 via another 
NCB and the liquidity amount is credited on 
a cross- border basis. The direct effect of 
EAPP transactions on the TARGET2 balance of a given NCB is the product of the differ-ence between that central bank’s own pur-
chases from banks outside its borders (ie 
banks with a TARGET2 account in countries abroad) and sales made by domestic banks 
(ie banks with a domestic TARGET2 ac-count) to foreign central banks belonging to the Eurosystem. The manner in which 
the counterparty is linked to TARGET2 can 
thus determine the direct effects of EAPP 
on the TARGET2 balance. This is particularly 
of signifi  cance because credit institutions 
domiciled outside the euro area participate 
in TARGET2 via a Eurosystem NCB,2 not 
1 In December 2015, the ECB Governing Council de-
cided to extend this to include regional and local gov-
ernment bonds.
2 Credit institutions domiciled in the European Eco-
nomic Area (EEA) or operating a branch in this area 
can maintain their own TARGET2 account with a Euro-system NCB (an arrangement referred to as direct par-
ticipation). Institutions not domiciled in the euro area 
and/or without a branch in this area can participate in 
TARGET2 via other direct participants (known as ad-
dressable BIC holders).Excess liquidity, cumulative EAPP purchases

least in the case of major international 
banks operating in the City of London.
Since international commercial banks also 
participate in TARGET2 via the Bundesbank, 
infl  ows to accounts held at the Bundesbank 
are generated whenever other Eurosystem 
NCBs purchase securities from these banks. 
Viewed in isolation, such structural infl  ows 
cause the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims to 
swell. In the case of cross- border transac-
tions, any changes to total TARGET2 claims 
in the Eurosystem hinge on the existing 
TARGET2 positions of the NCBs involved in the transaction (see the chart above).
One EAPP- induced indirect effect on the TARGET2 balances arises when the add-
itional liquidity gained from that programme 
is redistributed across borders in a second- 
round effect. This occurs on a frequent 
basis, also through intra- group transactions on the part of international banks. Needless 
to say, a raft of other (cross- border) deal-
ings likewise affect the TARGET2 balances. 
While monthly purchases in 2015 stood at 
roughly €60 billion, TARGET2 turnover came to €1.9 trillion per day. It is for this 
reason that TARGET2 balances demonstrate 
a perceptibly higher degree of volatility 
compared with the steady (cumulative) in-
crease in purchases under EAPP (see chart 
on page 53).
The path followed by the TARGET2 bal-
ances of individual central banks is hetero-
geneous (see the the chart on page  55). 
Looking at the ECB, the launch of the EAPP 
has meant that TARGET2 liabilities are cre-
ated during settlement. This stems from the fact that the ECB purchases securities for its 
own account and yet credit institutions do Direct impact of EAPP * on total TARGET2 claims**

not hold accounts with the ECB.3 The ECB 
counterparties’ accounts to which the li-
quidity is credited are maintained by NCBs. 
Hence, each purchase of a security by the 
ECB automatically results in a “cross- border” 
transaction, thus increasing the ECB’s 
TARGET2 liabilities (see the chart above).4
In 2015, there was an upturn in TARGET2 
liabilities, especially in Spain and Italy, whereas in Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg there was a rise in TARGET2 claims. Overall, from a long- term perspec-tive, the phase of decreasing TARGET2 
claims/liabilities that persisted up to around 
the beginning of 2015 has since been re-
placed by a shift back towards rising 
TARGET2 claims/liabilities (see the chart 
above). However, aside from the infl  uence 
of the EAPP described above, the increase 
in the fi  rst six months of 2015 was also at-
tributable to the escalation of the fi  nancial stress situation in Greece at that time, 
which was then defused in the summer of 
2015 with the introduction of capital con-
trols and agreement on an additional assis-
tance package.
3 The ECB’s role in managing accounts in TARGET2 is 
essentially limited to other pan- European payment sys-
tems operated by the private sector (notably EURO1 
and CLS) where inpayments and outpayments mutu-

of TARGET2 balances at the ECB. The ECB can inter alia 
maintain accounts for other central banks as well as 
European and international organisations, but may not 
do so for credit institutions (ECB Governing Council’s

on whether the NCB used for settling the transaction 
itself has a negative or a positive TARGET2 balance (see the chart on page 54).Selected TARGET2 balances in the Eurosystem

Reserve assets
Transaction- related changes in the reserve 
assets are shown as a separate item in the bal -
ance of payments. In 2015, they fell by €2 bil -
lion. The decline was due, in particular, to a 
change in the reserve position with the Inter -
national Monetary Fund.
The international reserve holdings are also in -
fluenced by balance sheet adjustments which, 
in line with internationally agreed accounting 
standards, are not recognised in the balance of payments. The end- of- year revaluation of the 
reserve assets at market prices resulted in an 
increase of €3 billion in 2015. This was mainly 
due to valuation gains arising from the appreci -
ation of the US dollar against the euro. These 
were reflected in the foreign reserves, in par -
ticular. By contrast, the value of German gold 
holdings fell owing to the drop in the price of 
gold during the course of 2015. All in all, Ger -
many’s reserve assets rose by €1 billion in bal -
ance sheet terms in 2015; at the cut- off date of 
31 December 2015, they amounted to €159½

Household wealth and finances  
in Germany: results of the 2014 survey
The Bundesbank surveyed German households on their wealth and debt again in 2014 after a first 
such survey in 2010. The primary objective of the study “Panel on household finances” (PHF) is to 
describe the financial situation of households as a whole as well as that of individual groups of 
households. Around half of the about 4,500 surveyed households took part in the study for the 
second time. Using the data from both studies, it is now possible to identify changes over time.
Both the distribution of wealth and the composition of household wealth in Germany are stable 
over time. Wealth is still relatively unevenly distributed as compared with other euro- area coun -
tries.
The low nominal interest rates and the rise in real estate and share prices do not appear to have 
triggered any major adjustments in terms of households’ investment behaviour between 2010 
and 2014. There have been no fundamental changes either in the share of households possessing 
certain assets (eg current/savings accounts, shares and real estate), or in the percentages of 
financial and real assets in households’ gross wealth.
This article focuses exclusively on the wealth held by households directly. Other aspects with an 
impact on households’ situation, such as government debt and assets, are not considered.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background
In 2010, the Bundesbank launched a survey, to 
be carried out at regular intervals, in order to 
gain detailed information about the wealth and 
income as well as the savings and investment 
behaviour of German households. These micro 
data allow the distribution of wealth in Ger -
many to be identified and analysed, and there -
fore supplement the aggregate figures pro -
vided by the financial accounts. Besides the 
data on wealth, information on household 
debt is also recorded, which can be important 
for financial stability analyses.
This article presents the key findings of the 
2014 survey, drawing comparisons with the re -
sults of the first survey, which was conducted 
in 2010, and places a particular emphasis on 
describing the distribution and composition of 
net wealth. It also briefly touches on household 
debt. More in- depth analyses and international 
comparisons are planned for the coming 
months.
Distribution of wealth 
in  Germany
According to the PHF study, the gross wealth of 
German households amounted to an average 
of €240,200 per household in 2014. After de -
ducting debt, this yields average net wealth of 
€214,500. Almost three- quarters of households 
had net wealth below this average in 2014. 
These average figures are generally heavily in -
fluenced by extreme values and do not tell us 
how wealth is distributed among households.1 
One way of gaining a picture of how wealth is 
distributed is to analyse the median values, ie 
the values which separate households into a 
richer and a poorer half.2 The median values 
are barely affected by very high or very low fig -
ures and, in 2014, were significantly lower than 
the average values: €77,200 for gross wealth 
and €60,400 for net wealth.The ratio between the median and the mean 
is  already an indication that net wealth is 
unevenly  distributed in Germany. Just how un -
even the distribution is can be deduced, for in -
stance, from the share of wealth held by the 
wealthiest 10% of households. This group ac -
counts for around 60% of total net wealth.3 In 
2014, the Gini coefficient4 for net wealth, 
which is a classic measure of inequality, was 
still high by international standards, at 76%.5 
The ratio of the 90% decile to the median pro -
vides a further indication that wealth is un -
evenly distributed in Germany. The higher this 
figure is, the greater the gap between the 
wealthiest 10% of households and the median, 
ie the middle of the distribution. The cut- off 
between the wealthiest 10% and all other 
households stood at €468,000 and is therefore 
roughly eight times higher than the median. By 
way of comparison, the 90/ 50 ratio for the 
euro area as a whole was five in 2010.Background to 
the PHF study
Median net 
wealth in 2014: 
€60,400Net wealth 
unevenly 
 distributed
1 To the contrary, the mean value is calculated by dividing 
total net wealth equally among the approximately 40 mil -
lion households in Germany.
2 In order to calculate the median, households are first 
sorted by wealth. The household wealth figure in the mid -
dle of this range constitutes the median. Based on the se -
quence of the households sorted according to wealth, fur -
ther parameters can be deduced (known as quantiles). A 
breakdown into five equal parts at 20%, 40%, 60% and 
80% yields the quintiles, and a breakdown into ten equal 
parts yields the deciles.
3 The share of wealth that can be attributed to the upper 
10% of the distribution is probably underestimated (see 
also P Vermeulen (2014), How fat is the top tail of the 
wealth distribution?, ECB Working Paper, No 1692). The 
approach behind the PHF study is to over- represent the 
wealthy households in the (unweighted) sample (see box 
on p 59). This is successful on the whole. As in all other 
comparable surveys, very wealthy households are missing 
from the PHF. None of the households surveyed in the PHF 
have assets amounting to €100 million or more. Nor is this 
under- recording offset through the weighting of the data.
4 The Gini coefficient generally assumes values between 
0% and 100%, with 0% representing a perfectly even dis -
tribution and 100% signifying maximum inequality. The 
closer the figure is to 100%, the more uneven the distribu -
tion.
5 For example, the Gini coefficient of net wealth in Italy 
stood at 61% in 2014. The latest available Gini coefficient 
for the euro area dates back to the year 2010, when it 
amounted to 69%. In the United States, wealth is more 
unevenly distributed than in Germany. There, the Gini co-
efficient stood at around 80% in 2013.Deutsche Bundesbank

PHF study 2014: concept for the second survey
Between April 2014 and November 2014, 
4,461 households comprising 9,256 per-sons aged 16 and over participated in the 
PHF study in Germany. Some of the house-
holds (2,191) were taking part in the PHF 
survey for the second time, whereas for the 
remaining 2,270 it was the fi  rst time their data was being collected. There was a re-sponse rate of 28% for successfully con-tacted households. The response rate was 
68% for households that had already par-
ticipated in the fi  rst wave of the survey 
(panel households) and 18% for those con-
tacted for the fi  rst time. The response rate 
for the panel households is comparable to 
other surveys conducted in Germany, but 
the fi  gure for households contacted for the fi  rst time is relatively low.
The methodology used in the second PHF 
survey in 2014 was largely based on that of the fi  rst survey in 2010 and 2011. As before, 
computer- assisted personal interviews 
(CAPI) were carried out face- to- face at the 
interviewee’s home. The around 300 trained interviewers required roughly an 
hour on average to complete an interview.
Addresses of households contacted for the 
fi  rst time were selected randomly from lists 
provided by residence registration offi   ces. 
An oversampling feature was implemented 
at this point, which means that wealthy 
households are overrepresented in the sam-
ple chosen.1 The higher selection probabil-
ity was taken into account in the weighting, 
so that the results shown can be regarded 
as being representative for households in 
Germany.
In order to ensure comparability across the 
individual surveys, only minor modifi  cations were made to the PHF questionnaire for the second wave. Larger adjustments were 
made only to the part of the questionnaire 
referring to private retirement provision. These changes aimed at simplifying the questionnaire for households, and no changes were made to the surveyed con-cepts. The questionnaire was expanded in 
some areas, to include questions on house-
holds’ expectations, for example. As in the 
2010-11 survey, interviews could again be conducted in Russian, Polish, Turkish or 
English. However, only very few households 
used the non- German version of the ques-
tionnaire.
Further information on the methodology and background of the PHF survey can 
be found under www.bundesbank.de/phf-
research.
1 Income tax statistics are used in sampling to divide 
smaller municipalities with less than 100,000 residents 
into “rich municipalities” and “other municipalities”. In cities with 100,000 residents and more, wealthy street 
sections are identifi  ed using micro- geographic infor-mation on residential area and purchasing power. 
Finally , the proportion of households in the sample is 
selected such that households in wealthy municipal-
ities and wealthy street sections are oversampled com-pared with their numbers in the population.Deutsche Bundesbank

Distribution of wealth 
in 2014 compared with 2010
To put the figures for 2014 into perspective, it 
is useful to compare them with the distribution 
of wealth in 2010.6 It should not be forgotten, 
however, that this takes into account only a 
relatively short period of approximately four 
years and that wealth is generally built up over 
the long term.
The persistently low rates of interest on savings 
and the rise in real estate and share prices in 
recent years do not appear to have had a par -
ticularly strong impact on the distribution of 
wealth in Germany between 2010 and 2014. 
The aforementioned distribution measures 
barely changed during the period under review. 
The share of total net wealth held by the 
wealthiest 10% of households in 2010 was, at 
59.2%, just 0.6 percentage point lower than in 
2014. The Gini coefficient for net wealth is vir -
tually identical for both years. Median net 
wealth rose by around €9,000 (+18%) in nom -
inal terms compared with 2010, which is less 
than €3,000 per year on average. Adjusted for 
inflation, this works out at a rise of €5,300 
(+10%) for the overall period.7 Mean net 
wealth increased by a nominal 10% or by 
around €19,300, which translates into a rise of 
3% after adjusting for inflation.8 The rise in 
average net wealth therefore matched the in -
crease in households’ aggregate disposable in -
come (including non- profit institutions serving 
households), which, according to the national 
accounts, rose by around 10% between 2010 
and 2014 in nominal terms, and by 3% after 
adjusting for inflation.9
There were changes in individual sections of 
the distribution, but these had little impact on 
the distribution measures.
The cut- offs for the bottom four deciles were 
lower in 2014 than in 2010. Households which 
belonged to the poorer 40% of households in 
2014 therefore have lower net wealth than 
those households which belonged to this sec -tion of the net wealth distribution in 2010.10 
These shifts should not be overrated, however, 
as the absolute changes were modest. Only 
rarely did they exceed €2,000. In 2010, for in -
stance, the cut- off between the bottom quar -
ter and the upper three quarters of the distribu -
tion of net wealth was €6,600; in 2014, net 
wealth of just €5,400 (-19%) was required to 
Distribution of 
wealth relatively stable on the whole
Changes in 
 individual  sections of the 
distribution6 An international comparison of the distribution of wealth 
and its dynamics would also be interesting. This is currently 
not possible for the year 2014, however, as the harmonised 
results of the Eurosystem’s 2014 “Household Finance and 
Consumption Survey” (HFCS) are not due to be published 
until the end of this year. The Banca d’Italia has already 
published initial results for Italy (see Banca d’Italia (2015), I 
bilanci delle famiglie italiane nell’anno 2014, Supplementi 
al Bollettino Statistico, Nuova serie, Numero 64). According 
to these figures, Italian households held median net wealth 
of €138,000 in 2014 (19% lower than in 2010). In terms of 
the mean value for net wealth, the two countries have 
now moved even closer together than in 2010 (Germany 
2014: €214,500, Italy 2014: €218,000) after Italy recorded 
a 16% decline and Germany a 10% increase.
7 Calculating inflation- adjusted wealth measures is not 
without its problems as there is no generally accepted asset 
price index. Typically, consumer price inflation is therefore 
used as a proxy. The calculation here is thus also based on 
developments in the consumer price index since 2010.
8 For the “Households and non- profit institutions serving 
households” sector, the aggregate balance sheet shows a 
nominal increase of 18% in aggregate net worth (excluding 
pension funds and the stock of consumer durables) for the 
same period (see Federal Statistical Office and Deutsche 
Bundesbank, Balance sheets for institutional sectors and 
the total economy, Wiesbaden). The differences could re -
sult from differing sectoral classifications, varying valu -
ations of individual assets and the under- recording of the 
financial assets of very wealthy households in the PHF 
study (see also Deutsche Bundesbank, Coverage of the 
total assets in the sector, Monthly Report, June 2013, 
pp 26-27). Other micro data sources come to similar results 
as the PHF study. The Socio-  Economic Panel (SOEP), in 
which respondents are not questioned in as much detail 
about wealth as in the PHF study, shows an increase in 
nominal median household net wealth from €38,500 to 
€50,000 for the period from 2007 to 2012 (Bundesbank 
calculations based on SOEP data v31). The mean value 
went up only marginally during this same period from 
€152,300 to €159,400. According to the Federal Statistical 
Office’s Sample Survey of Income and Expenditure (EVS), 
the median of nominal net wealth between 2008 and 
2013 rose from €42,600 to €46,100 and the mean value 
from €127,200 to €134,700. The explicit non- inclusion of 
households with a monthly net income of more than 
€18,000 in the EVS is presumably the reason why the me -
dian, the mean and the share of the wealthiest 10% of 
households are lower than the figures recorded in the PHF 
study.

10 This does not necessarily mean that those households 
with few assets in 2010 had even fewer in 2014. A house -
hold which was poor in 2010 might have moved to a dif -
ferent section of the distribution in 2014 because it re -
ceived inheritance, for instance.Deutsche Bundesbank

be classed among the wealthiest 75% of 
households. Furthermore, the share of house -
holds with negative net wealth, ie households 
whose debt exceeds their assets, rose slightly 
from just over 7% in 2010 to 9% in 2014. This 
picture does not change until you reach the 
middle of the distribution, as of the 45th per -
centile to be precise, and the cut- offs shift up -
wards. This is particularly true when analysing 
the nominal values. If inflation is taken into ac -
count, there were no notable shifts, especially 
in the upper part of the wealth distribution, as 
is also evident from the above chart.
Distribution of wealth 
over time
The cross- sectional analysis described at the 
beginning of this article allows an initial assess -
ment of the dynamics of the distribution of 
wealth in Germany. It does not, however, pro -
vide any information as to whether the position of certain groups of households in the distribu -
tion of wealth has changed over time. A longi -
tudinal analysis, which is, for the first time, pos -
sible with the panel data from the PHF study 
now that the data of the second round of the 
survey are available, provides information on 
this, too. However, only those 2,139 house -
holds which took part in both the 2010 and the 
2014 studies can be taken into consideration 
for the analysis.11
As in the case of the cross- sectional analysis, 
the longitudinal analysis shows that the distri -
bution of wealth is comparatively stable. Only a 
small share of households changed their pos -
ition in the distribution of wealth by more than 
one quintile (20% step) between 2010 and

11 Overall, it was possible to re- interview people in 2,191 
households. However, only 2,139 households, whose struc -
ture has not changed substantially, were considered for the 
analyses in this chapter. In particular, households created, 
for instance, because one person has moved out of a 
household interviewed in the first survey (split household) 
were not considered.Deutsche Bundesbank

2014. Households which had positive net 
wealth in 2010 and negative net wealth in 
2014 account for a share of around 6% of all 
households. Conversely, around 3% of house -
holds moved out of the negative net wealth 
category between 2010 and 2014.
If households are grouped according to their 
position in the distribution of wealth in 2010, 
it becomes apparent that mean net wealth in -
creased over time in all groups, except for the 
wealthiest 10% of households.12 On average, 
wealth rose by €11,000 across all panel house -
holds. Relative to the average net wealth of 
these households in 2010, this represents 
growth of 5% between 2010 and 2014. For 
half of households, the increase was smaller at 
€3,200 or less, or their wealth even con -
tracted.
Looking at the mean and median values for 
the change in net wealth somewhat obscures 
the dynamics at the household level. Some 
households achieved significant gains in 
wealth, while others suffered fairly large losses. 
Just over a quarter of panel households re -
corded gains in wealth of €50,000 or more 
between  2010 and 2014, whereas around a 
sixth recorded a loss of €50,000 or more. The 
largest absolute gains, and losses, affected 
households in the upper half of the distribu -
tion in 2010.
The major significance of real estate in terms of 
household wealth was already apparent in the 
first PHF study.13 The longitudinal analysis 
underscores this fact once again. Whereas half 
of households that own their main residence 
recorded gains of more than €33,500 in overall 
net wealth between 2010 and 2014, the major -
ity of tenants had to content themselves with 
gains of less than €1,000 or even recorded 
losses.
The picture is similar for households which own 
securities compared with those that do not. 
The net wealth of half of securities owners rose 
by more than €38,000. By contrast, the net wealth of more than half of households which 
do not own securities rose by less than €2,500 
or even declined. Given that securities are pri -
marily held by wealthy households and by 
those with a high income, which are also often 
real estate owners, the growth in the total net 
wealth of securities holders is, at least in part, 
also attributable to their ownership of real es -
tate.
Wealth and income
An isolated analysis of wealth is only of limited 
use when assessing a household’s financial 
situation. Since a household’s consumption can 
be financed through both income and wealth, 
the combination of the two is relevant. There is 
certainly a correlation between households’ 
current income14 and their level of wealth. This 
relationship is not linear, however. All income 
groups contain households with high and low 
net wealth. The correlation is stronger at the 
edges of the distribution. In 2014, for instance, 
of the 20% of households with the lowest or 
the highest income, around half also belonged 
to the 20% of households with a low or a high 
level of wealth. The fact that the correlation 
between income and wealth is not linear also 
explains why households with the highest in -
come have a significantly lower share in overall Households 
build up wealth over time
Wealth gains for 
owners of real estate and households pos-sessing securities
12 Typically, the wealthiest households tend to be those 
with older household members. For example, the share of 
households where the main earner is aged 65 years or 
above is greatest at the upper end of the distribution at 
almost 60%. The dynamics in this segment are therefore 
also influenced by transfers of wealth to other, younger 
households.
13 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Household wealth and fi -
nances in Germany: results of the Bundesbank survey, 
Monthly Report, June 2013, pp 23-49.
14 The measure of income used here is determined on the 
basis of a question that is formulated in the same way as in 
the microcensus. At the beginning of the survey, house -
holds are asked to state their monthly disposable net in -
come. Gross income can also be calculated from the PHF 
data by adding up various types of income that were ascer -
tained by means of specific questions during the survey. For 
the purposes of the present analysis, net income appears 
to be the more meaningful reference variable, as only net 
income can be used for acquiring assets and for consump -
tion purposes.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
March 2016  
62

net wealth, at 37%, than the wealthiest house -
holds (see the upper chart on this page).
The relationship between income and wealth is 
also influenced by the fact that both variables 
generally follow certain life- cycle patterns. Pen -
sioners and older persons at the end of their 
working lives typically have more assets than 
younger households, even if the latter have a 
relatively high income on average. This pattern 
is also visible in the PHF data (see the lower 
chart on this page).
With increasing age, there is a change not only 
in the wealth accumulated through savings, 
capital transfers and asset price movements, 
but also in the composition of households. 
Households split up, resulting in wealth being 
spread across more than one household, or 
new individuals join a household bringing 
assets with them. These dynamics undoubtedly 
also play a part in the described relationship 
between income, wealth and age, since there 
are sometimes clear differences between vari -
ous types of households with regard to their 
wealth, and the frequency of the individual 
types varies across the age groups.
Independently of age, households with above- 
average wealth may have a comparatively low 
income. Self- employed persons, for example, 
are compelled to build up private wealth as a 
retirement provision, even if they do not, at 
times, earn much. The chosen definition of 
wealth is important for this analysis, eg the fact 
that, for the employed, claims on the statutory 
social security  systems are not counted towards 
wealth in the PHF survey.
Composition of wealth
Along with the distribution of wealth, the com -
position of wealth is of interest. The PHF survey 
thus collects detailed information on individual 
assets and financial investments. A comprehen -
sive assessment of households’ financial situ -
ation is possible only after a breakdown into asset classes and types of liabilities. Analysing 
the composition of wealth also makes it pos -
sible to assess which assets are associated with 
large wealth. This is of relevance not least Income and

The PHF’s defi  nition of wealth
The PHF study aims to compile and present 
detailed information on households’ 
wealth1 in Germany. The PHF’s defi  nition of 
wealth is therefore designed to capture 
both the assets and liabilities on house-
holds’ balance sheets. The assets side (gross wealth) consists of non- fi  nancial assets and fi  nancial assets. On the liabilities side, assets 
are contrasted with liabilities, ie loans se-cured by real estate and unsecured loans. Net wealth is calculated as the difference 
between gross wealth and debt.
The depth of information on the types of wealth captured in the PHF goes beyond other surveys on the subject of wealth. In 
non- fi  nancial assets, for example, the value 
of vehicles, collections and jewellery is re-corded alongside property and business ownership. There is also comprehensive coverage of fi  nancial assets. These consist of balances with banks, such as savings banks and building and loan associations, 
securities, long- term equity investment and managed assets. The positive balances from 
private pension and life insurance policies are also included
2. Not included are any 
statutory pension claims that lie in the dis-
tant future. As a pay- as- you go system 
exists in Germany, a variety of assumptions would fi  rst be needed to recalculate (capit-alise) future pension entitlements as assets. 
Moreover, these are only claims and not 
savings.
The households evaluate their assets them-
selves. This is mainly relevant for real estate 
and business ownership. In both cases, 
households are asked what price could be 
achieved for their property or business if it 
were to be sold.
Assets held abroad are also included in the 
calculation of a household’s total assets, if 
the respondents report them.
1 The PHF defi  nes households as groups of persons 
whose centre of life is at a shared address and who 
share daily expenses. Persons who temporarily do not 
live at that address but regularly return there are also 
considered part of the household. Persons or groups 
of persons who live in a shared residence without hav-
ing a family or partnership relationship, or domestic 
staff residing at that address, constitute households in 
their own right.2 Households’ wealth includes private pension and life insurance policies in the accumulation phase or where contributions have been suspended. They are removed 
from the households’ balance sheets once payouts 
from the policies are commenced; the relevant fl  ows 
of income are then taken into account when calculat-ing income.Balance sheet of a household –a schematic overview

when comparing the distribution and dynamics 
of wealth across countries.15
Furthermore, the composition of net wealth 
plays an important part in terms of the impact 
of economic shocks and the transmission of 
monetary policy measures. As the portfolio 
composition of low- wealth households nor -
mally differs from those with greater wealth, 
diverging developments in the value of various 
assets generally also involve distribution ef -
fects. Analysing portfolios along the distribu -
tion of assets therefore provides clues as to 
what types of households might be particularly 
affected by certain monetary policy measures.
Looking at the total real assets16 of all house -
holds, every household possessed €187,000 on 
average in 2014. Considering only the 81% of 
households that possessed any real assets at 
all, the PHF survey shows a conditional mean 
value17 of €230,800 for 2014. In nominal 
terms, both figures rose by no more than 7% 
and 6% respectively compared with 2010. 
There was more obvious growth in financial 
assets,18 which were possessed by nearly all 
households. On average, each household held 
€53,900 worth of financial assets in 2014, 
compared with €47,000 in 2010. This corres -
ponds to a nominal increase of 15%, which is 
likely due to increases in the prices of shares 
and other securities as well as households’ sav -
ing efforts. By their own account, households 
saved, on average, roughly 5% of their dispos -
able income in 2014, leaving aside mortgage 
loan repayments.19
In 2014, financial and real assets, like net 
wealth as a whole, were spread unevenly. The 
medians for financial and real assets were 
clearly lower than the mean values, which 
points to a concentration of both types of 
assets on rich households. For real assets, there 
was a conditional median of €90,600 and a 
conditional mean value of €230,800, for finan -
cial assets the figures were €16,600 (condi -
tional median) and €54,200 (conditional mean 
value).The distribution of households’ gross wealth in 
terms of financial and real assets showed no 
substantial change between 2010 and 2014. As 
before, real assets represent the overwhelming 
share of gross wealth, as is shown in the chart 
on page 68. As in 2010, real estate and busi -
ness assets as well as the value of vehicles and 
other valuables added up to approximately 
80% of households’ total gross wealth. It is 
true that some of the real assets were offset by 
debts, but even after debts have been de -
ducted, real assets were still clearly higher in 
2014 than households’ financial assets. This 
does not apply in the lowest fifth of the wealth 
distribution, in which debts predominate and 
outweigh total real assets.
Within real assets, real estate played the big -
gest role. In 2014, 44% of households owned 
their main residence. The share of households 
possessing other real estate (eg buy- to- let 
property, but also land) stood at 20%. Al -

16 Real assets are composed of the gross value of owner- 
occupied property, other property (eg buy- to- let property, 
but also land), of vehicles as well as valuable collections 
and jewellery and the net value of enterprises in which at 
least one household member occupies an active position in 
management.
17 Here and below, the qualification “conditional” in the 
case of mean value or median indicates that households 
which do not possess a certain class of assets or type of 
debt have not been included in the calculation of the 
mean. In contrast to this, in the case of unconditional 
mean values or medians, all households are considered, ie 
households that do not possess a given asset are included 
in the calculation with a value of zero. If individual classes 
of assets or types of debt are to be found only in the case 
of a few households, there is generally a clear difference 
between conditional and unconditional values.
18 In this section, balances with banks, savings banks and 
building and loan associations, from securities, equity hold -
ings and managed assets, as well as balances from private 
pension and life insurance policies are analysed together 
(gross financial assets). Debts and loans are not deducted 
from financial assets.
19 The (net) savings amount recognised here is the sum of 
payments for the formation of financial and real assets less 
the liquidation of savings deposits in the past year and new 
borrowing for consumption purposes. If the liquidation of 
savings deposits and new consumer borrowing is greater 
than the sum of payments for the formation of financial 
and real assets, the savings amount becomes negative. 
Households that do not save are incorporated with a value 
of €0 when computing the average.Deutsche Bundesbank

Selected research results based on PHF data
The study “Panel on household fi  nances“ 
(PHF) not only provides interesting results for policy consultants, it also represents a large data pool for academic research on 
the behaviour and fi  nancial situation of 
German households. More than 60 re-
searchers in Germany and over 150 foreign- 
based researchers are now using the an-onymised data for research purposes. The empirical and theoretical projects cover a 
large range of subjects. There are, amongst 
others, studies on the infl  uence of monet-
ary policy on the distribution of wealth, on the importance of residential property in ac-cumulating wealth or on the measurement of poverty and consumption. Issues relating to fi  nancial stability and household debt are 
also examined, to name just a few ex-
amples. The integration of the PHF into the 
Household Finance and Consumption Sur-vey (HFCS) inspired a number of projects 
comparing structures across countries.
The research results listed below represent 
only a small selection of the many projects using PHF and HFCS data for the euro area.
In recent years, nominal interest rates on 
savings deposits have dropped to historical 
lows, while share and real estate prices have risen. At the same time, infl  ation is 
stable at a very low level. A number of re-
search projects are therefore using the 
micro data from the PHF and the HFCS to 
tackle the question of what consequences 
these developments have for the distribu-
tion of wealth in Germany and other Euro-
pean countries. Klaus Adam and Junyi Zhu 
(2015)1 demonstrate the effects of unex-
pected infl  ation on the real distribution of wealth in euro- area countries. They start 
with the assumption that the real value of 
net wealth will change depending on the prevailing rate of infl  ation. They conclude 
that Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain bene-fi  t most, overall, from unexpected infl  ation. 
Households in Belgium, Ireland and Ger-many experience the highest loss in terms 
of real per capita wealth. An analysis not of 
infl  ation rates, but of changes in asset 
prices also reveals differences between the 
euro- area countries. Klaus Adam and Pana-
giota Tzamourani (2015)2 conclude from 
their analyses that the median German household does not benefi  t from rising house prices at all, as home ownership rates in Germany are particularly low. By 
contrast, they fi  nd that rising house prices 
in Spain, Portugal, Finland or even the Netherlands reduce inequality within the 
country.
In the wake of the fi  nancial crisis, observers 
turned their attention to household debt. 
Dimitris Christelis et al (2015)3 compare 
household debt in the United States and Europe. They fi  nd that households in the 
United States must use a larger percentage of their income to service debt than house-
holds in Europe. This can be attributed to the institutional framework, which allows 
US households to take on more debt for a 
given level of wealth or collateral. Miguel 
Ampudia et al (2014)4 fi  nd that households 
in the euro area are relatively resilient to 
negative shocks. Their paper is one of sev-
eral that use the PHF data for stress tests on households. As with bank stress tests, they simulate stress in the household sector (for instance in the form of changing mortgage rates, income losses or sharply lower house

spread (75% of households), their average 
value, at €13,200, was significantly lower than 
the average value of real estate (€231,400). 
Real estate ownership was concentrated mainly 
on wealthier households. It is not least for that 
reason that the ownership of real estate and its 
value is a good indicator of a household’s pos -
ition in the distribution of wealth, as the chart 
on page 68 shows. In the top fifth of the net 
wealth distribution in 2014, fewer than 10% of 
households did not own their home. The rise in 
real estate prices thus principally benefits 
households in the upper income distribution 
range.
Business assets are even more strongly concen -
trated than real estate ownership. In 2014, only 
10% of households possessed a business or an 
enterprise in which they took an active part. 
Some households with business ownership are 
also found in the middle of the wealth distribu -
tion. The businesses of these households are, 
however, comparatively small and worth only just over €26,900 on average. Only with the 
richest 10% in terms of net wealth did business 
ownership play a more important role in their 
assets portfolio. In this group, more than a 
third of households held a stake in a business in 
2014. On average, business assets for these 
households owning a business added up to 
€910,900.
Almost every household in Germany possesses 
some type of financial asset. In 2014, the most 
widespread of these were current accounts 
and savings accounts. Virtually all surveyed 
households possessed a current account. Al -
most three-  quarters of all households pos -
sessed a savings account at a bank or with a 
building and loan association. The share of 
households with a savings account in 2014 was 
6 percentage points lower than in 2011. How -
ever, the average value of savings accounts 
rose during the same period. Almost half of 
households (46%) also possessed assets in the 
form of private voluntary pension plans or Savings deposits 
and retirement provision most important  components of financial assetsprices) and then examine which households 
are affected by these stress factors and by 
how much, and how their fi  nancial situ-
ation and debt levels change.
The data from the PHF and those from the 
other euro- area countries can also be used 
to examine the infl  uence of a country’s in-
stitutional framework on households’ fi  nan-
cial situation. Pirmin Fessler and Martin Schürz analyse the social security system.
5 
They fi  nd that social services provided by 
the state may replace private wealth accu-
mulation and therefore partly explain why household wealth differs across euro- area 
countries. Lien Pham- Dao (2015),6 too, uses 
micro data on household wealth to show 
that differences in net wealth inequality in 
the euro- area countries can be attributed, 
in part, to the different social security sys-
tems.Researchers may apply for access to the anonymised  data (scientifi  c use fi  les) for academic projects. More information and 
forms to apply for access to the data can be

site at www.bundesbank.de/phf- data.

whole life insurance policies. The percentage of 
savings plans, retirement provision products 
and whole life insurance policies in total finan -
cial assets remained  constant between 2010 
and 2014, even though households showed 
higher financial assets overall in 2014 than they 
had done in 2010.
Share ownership continues to be not very 
widespread, with only 10% of households 
holding shares directly in 2014.20 In the case of 
the wealthiest 20% of the distribution, the per -
centage of households holding shares, was sig -
nificantly higher, at 32%, and unchanged from 
2010. The share of households that possess 
mutual funds declined from 17% to 13% be -
tween 2010 and 2014. German households’ 
investment  behaviour may therefore still be 
regarded  as fairly conservative on the whole.21
Looking at households which have taken part 
in the PHF survey more than once, it is also 
clear that there have been no major shifts or changes in the composition of their portfolios. 
In the case of the households surveyed for a 
second time, the share of households with 
financial  assets remained unchanged at 96%. 
This is not surprising given that nearly all house -
holds already possessed this type of asset in 
2010. The share of households with real assets 
rose marginally by 2 percentage points. Group -
ing households according to their position in 
the distribution of wealth in 2010, it becomes 
apparent that the slight rise in households with 
real assets is mainly due to poorer households. 
In this group, the highest increase was seen in 
the share of households owning passenger cars 
and other vehicles.
Not only was the percentage of households 
with financial and real assets stable, there were 
also no more than minor changes in the sub -
components of these classes of assets. Among 
the panel households, the percentage of 
households owning their main residence grew 
by 1 percentage point.22 This is due, in particu -
lar, to households in the second wealth quan -
tile, where the percentage of homeowners 
went up by 7 percentage points. Inheritances 
and gifts appear to be responsible for a large 
part of this increase. Within this group, there 
was only a marginal rise in the percentage of 
households with mortgage debts. It will be Taking a longitu-
dinal view, the composition of wealth is also relatively stableBreakdown of households’ net wealthby quantiles

20 According to the Deutsches Aktieninstitut (DAI), roughly 
6% of all persons aged 14 or older had direct share owner -
ship in 2014 (see study by the Deutsches Aktieninstitut 
(2015), Aktionärszahlen des Deutschen Aktieninstituts 
2014). According to the DAI, the number of people owning 
shares only increased by about 250,000 between 2010 
and 2014. The figures are not directly comparable with 
those of the PHF survey, since the level of analysis differs 
(individuals as against households), but they do present a 
similar picture.
21 These results support the findings based on the financial 
accounts. See Deutsche Bundesbank, German households’ 
saving and investment behaviour in light of the low-  
interest- rate environment, Monthly Report, October 2015, 
pp 13-31.
22 While the percentage of households with residential 
property remained constant in a cross-sectional analysis, it 
showed a minimal rise for the panel households. These 
findings are not contradictory. The households surveyed for 
a second time had aged between three and four years be -
tween 2010 and 2014 and had had time to save the neces -
sary capital for a deposit or to acquire a property. Among 
the households surveyed only in 2010 or 2014, there is, by 
contrast, a greater percentage of younger households that, 
typically, do not yet possess any real estate.Deutsche Bundesbank

interesting to continue observing these dynam -
ics, since asset transfers are likely to play an 
even more important role in the distribution of 
wealth in the future owing to the increasing 
average age of society.
The rather conservative investment behaviour 
of households in Germany is also reflected in 
the results for the second- time participants in 
the PHF study. The share of households pos -
sessing savings deposits or building loan con -
tracts did fall by 4 percentage points, but, at 
75% in 2014, it was still clearly higher than the 
percentages for other forms of investment. At 
the same time, there was also a decline in the 
percentage of households taking part in the 
survey for the second time which held secur -
ities. Mutual funds and debt securities were 
held by 15% and 3% of households respect -
ively (-3 percentage points in each case) and 
shares were held by 11% of households 
(-1 percentage point).Households’ debt situation
In the wake of the financial crisis, household 
debt became a matter of political interest. 
Since the first wave of the survey, the PHF study 
has been collecting detailed figures on house -
holds’ loans and other liabilities in Germany.23 
The available information not only makes it 
possible to investigate the incidence of debt 
but also allows an assessment of debt sustain -
ability, measured, say, as the percentage of 
debt servicing in income.
Roughly half of households (45%) were in -
debted in 2014. Most liabilities were offset by a 
matching level of assets. Moreover, the out -
standing amounts for unsecured loans24 were Small outstand-

comparatively small. For more than half of in -
debted households, the value of the debts was 
below €3,500. As might be expected, mort -
gage loans were of greater importance with 
regard to the level of debt. The median of 
households’ debt in this type of borrowing 
stood at around €76,300.
Measured in terms of interest payments and 
principal repayments as a percentage of house -
holds’ net income, the majority of indebted 
households appear to have been in a position 
to sustain debt in 2014. Less than 10% of in -
debted households had to use more than half 
their net income for redemption and interest 
payments. Roughly 60% of households used 
less than 20% of their net income to service 
debt. In absolute terms, the average debt ser -
vice for indebted households rose from about 
€7,900 to €9,000 a year between 2010 and 
2014. Both figures correspond to some 20% of 
the average net annual income of an indebted 
household in the respective year. Households 
used a large part of the debt service for mort -
gage loans. Considering only households with 
mortgage loans and the debt service for this 
type of borrowing, the share of debt service in 
income in 2014 stood at roughly 23% on aver -
age, which was 2 percentage points down on 
2010. This decline could be due to the low 
nominal interest rates for mortgage loans, which benefited households taking out new 
mortgage loans or possessing mortgage loans 
with variable interest rates, as well as those 
whose period of fixed interest came to an end.
Summary and outlook
This article documents the results of the second 
wave of the “Panel on Household Finances” 
(PHF) study. In many respects, the results of the 
2014 survey confirm the results of the first 
wave of the survey,25 and do so despite differ -
ing developments that are relevant to assets, 
such as cuts in interest rates and increases in 
the value of real estate and shares. The net 
wealth of households in Germany was distrib -
uted unequally in 2014, the median of net 
wealth was low in an international comparison, 
and households’ investment behaviour tended 
to be conservative. Repeating the survey has 
also provided fresh insights, however. It is ap -
parent, for example, that the distribution of 
wealth was stable between 2010 and 2014 and 
that, in terms of their investment behaviour, 
households have barely responded so far to 
changes in asset prices and nominal interest 
rates.Most households

This article focuses exclusively on wealth pos -
sessed directly by households. The situation of 
households is also shaped by other sectors, 
however, such as government debt and assets. 
Furthermore, when discussing the distribution 
of wealth, it should be borne in mind that 
wealth models only one part of a household’s 
financial situation. For instance, there are in 
fact a number of households with small wealth 
but a high income.
The next wave of the PHF survey is scheduled 
for 2017, when, once again, more than 5,000 
households are to be asked about their wealth. 
For some households, this will be the third time 
that they will be surveyed. Before that, the re -
sults of the wealth surveys in the euro area will 
be published. A particular point of interest will 
then be a comparison of developments in the 
distribution of wealth in Germany with devel -
opments in the rest of the euro area.
Table appendix
Only a small selection of the figures on German 
household finances could be presented in the main article on the PHF survey findings. The fol -
lowing appendix contains further tables. Each 
table shows the percentage of households 
which own a particular asset or are in debt 
(participation rates), the conditional mean 
value and the conditional median. “Condi -
tional” in this context means that the mean val -
ues and medians are all computed only for 
those households which possess a given asset 
or which are indebted in a particular way. 
Where no participation rate is stated, it is 100% 
and the mean values and medians refer to all 
households. These three statistics are shown in 
total as well as broken down by the age, na -
tionality, labour market status, education and 
vocational training of the reference person,26 
the type of household, the region in which a 
household lives and its homeownership status. 
Moreover, a differentiation is made according 
to a household’s position in the distributions of 
net wealth and gross income.
26 In this context, the reference person is always the per -
son with the highest income in the household. If two or 
more members of a household have an equally high in -
come, one person is selected at random.Deutsche Bundesbank

The role and effects of the Agreement on 
Net Financial Assets (ANFA) in the context 
of implementing monetary policy
Besides the joint tasks outlined in the Statute of the ESCB, national central banks (NCBs) of the 
Eurosystem may also perform functions autonomously based on national legislation. The differ -
ence between the single monetary policy and non- monetary policy tasks performed on the 
responsibility and liability of NCBs is unique to the European monetary union and cannot be com -
pared with the institutional set- up of other currency areas.
A key factor determining how efficiently the single monetary policy is being conducted in the euro 
area is the banking sector’s structural liquidity position vis- à- vis the Eurosystem. Monetary as well 
as non- monetary policy operations carried out by the NCBs are a source of central bank money. 
Both types of operation have an impact on the banking sector’s liquidity position.
To ensure that the NCBs’ non- monetary policy activities are compatible with the single monetary 
policy of the Eurosystem in this specific environment, the Eurosystem NCBs and the ECB signed the 
Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA). Together with the monetary policy parameters laid 
down by the ECB Governing Council, ANFA governs the maximum permissible aggregate amount 
of non-  monetary policy balance sheet activities (ie net financial assets; NFA) of the Eurosystem 
and allocates them among the NCBs. In the past, this ensured that the banking system had a 
structural liquidity deficit vis- à- vis the Eurosystem.
The Bundesbank always held a comparatively low volume of NFA not relating to monetary policy. 
At the end of 2015, the volume of non- monetary policy liability items even surpassed the volume 
of non- monetary policy asset items, which meant that, at -€50 billion, NFA were negative.
The ANFA is a useful tool to ensure that the operations conducted by the NCBs based on national 
legislation are compatible with the objectives of the Eurosystem in terms of its single monetary 
policy. The publication of ANFA by the ECB at the beginning of February 2016 is welcome as trans -
parency promotes central banks’ credibility and, by extension, confidence in their ability to fulfil 
their monetary policy tasks in a sustainable manner.Deutsche Bundesbank

Specific features of monetary 
union and the need for an 
agreement on net financial 
assets not relating to 
 monetary policy
The Agreement on Net Financial Assets1 
(ANFA), a contractual agreement among all 
Euro system national central banks (NCBs), was 
published by the ECB at the beginning of Feb -
ruary 2016. The overarching aim of ANFA is to 
ensure that the NCBs’ non- monetary policy ac -
tivities are consistent with the single monetary 
policy of the Eurosystem. Distinguishing mon -
etary policy tasks, which are carried out ac -
cording to uniform Eurosystem rules, from 
non- monetary policy tasks, which comprise all 
other national tasks of any one NCB, is a unique 
feature of the European monetary union and 
cannot be compared with the institutional 
frameworks of other national currency areas. 
ANFA emerged from, and was further de -
veloped on the basis of a special legal and eco -
nomic background.
When the European monetary union was 
founded, the member states decided to include 
only those NCB tasks and functions at the 
Community level which are essential to a single 
monetary policy across the entire euro area. 
This means that, besides the joint tasks out -
lined in the Statute of the ESCB, the NCBs may 
autonomously carry out national functions 
based on national legislation. These national 
functions can include, for example, on the 
assets side of the central bank’s balance sheet, 
the purchase of non- monetary policy securities 
for general investment purposes or, on the 
 liabilities side, the acceptance of government 
deposits or deposits from other central banks 
and international institutions.2
However, according to Article 14.4 of the ESCB 
Statute, all functions that are not related to 
monetary policy must be consistent with the 
objectives and tasks of the ESCB.3 If liquidity 
effects result from an NCB’s operations con -ducted on its own responsibility and liability, 
they could negatively affect the liquidity pos -
ition relevant from a monetary policy perspec -
tive.4 For example, if the ECB Governing Coun -
cil (by a two- thirds majority) deemed an oper -
ation conducted by an NCB on its own respon -
sibility and liability to interfere with the 
Eurosystem’s monetary policy stance, it would 
have to prohibit such activity under Article 14.4 
of the ESCB Statute. In this context, ANFA can 
be interpreted as a voluntary, self- binding 
agreement among the Eurosystem central 
banks. The agreement works preventively as it 
generally makes ECB Governing Council deci -
sions based on Article 14.4 of the ESCB Statute 
redundant by providing a framework for con -
straining the liquidity effect resulting from non- 
monetary policy activities. However, the option 
for the ECB Governing Council to intervene at 
all times pursuant to Article 14.4 of the ESCB 
Statute remains  unaffected.
When the monetary union was established in 
1999, the Eurosystem boasted aggregate total 
assets of just under €700 billion. Just under 
three- quarters of this sum consisted of non-  
monetary policy assets (see the chart on 
page 86), which were allocated among the in -
dividual NCBs in varying amounts. The NCBs’ 
official reserve assets (ie non- euro- denominated 
assets), which are held and administered by the 
Eurosystem on the basis of Union law, too, fall 
into the same category according to ANFA National tasks 
carried out on NCBs’ own responsibility and liability explicitly approved when 
monetary union 
was founded, …

cial Assets ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/en_

2 In addition, the Bundesbank carries out national func -
tions which are not reflected in the balance sheet. These 
include market management operations for Federal secur -
ities as fiscal agent on behalf of the Federal Government.
3 See Article 14.4 of the ESCB Statute: “National central 
banks may perform functions other than those specified in 
this Statute unless the Governing Council finds, by a major -
ity of two thirds of the votes cast, that these interfere with 
the objectives and tasks of the ESCB. Such functions shall 
be performed on the responsibility and liability of national 
central banks and shall not be regarded as being part of 
the functions of the ESCB.”

logic. At around €337 billion,5 reserve assets 
back then represented the largest item on the 
aggregated balance sheet of the Eurosystem. 
In addition to the monetary policy operations 
for the euro area, which amounted to €185 bil -
lion at the time, euro- denominated securities 
held for non- monetary policy purposes made 
up a significant part of the Eurosystem’s bal -
ance sheet. The historical reasons for maintain -
ing such portfolios are outlined below.
The financial assets held by the NCBs prior to 
stage three of European Economic and Monet -
ary Union (EMU)6, which were denominated in 
legacy currencies, can be roughly broken down 
into three categories.
First, NCBs held securities which were closely 
linked to the monetary policy conducted in 
stage two of EMU. For the most part, these 
were securities held for monetary policy pur -
poses in the form of both government bonds 
(denominated in the relevant national currency) 
and bonds held as foreign reserves denomin -
ated in the legacy currencies of the future 
euro- area member states (especially bonds 
 denominated in Deutsche Mark and French 
Francs). Although the monetary policies of the 
member states began to be more closely co -
ordinated as from stage two of EMU, they re -
mained a national responsibility. These secur -
ities ceased to be national monetary policy in -
struments or foreign reserves upon the issuing 
country’s entry into EMU. When EMU was first 
established, the Eurosystem did not require any 
securities to conduct its monetary policy as the 
original approach to monetary policy imple -
mentation was based solely on reverse refinan -
cing operations. As a result, such securities 
were declared domestic, non- monetary policy 
assets when the single currency was intro -
duced. Securities holdings, which were origin -
ally the result of a link to monetary policy prior 
to monetary union, amounted to around €22 
billion. These holdings were recorded under 
what was then asset item 6 of the aggregated 
balance sheet of the Eurosystem,  “Securities of 
euro- area residents denominated in euro”.7Second, a number of NCBs also reported do -
mestic assets denominated in their national 
currency without a direct link to monetary pol -
icy. These assets were then used for securitised 
lending or market making purposes, amongst 
other things. In addition, some NCBs held port -
folios for investment purposes prior to stage 
three of EMU; these were explicitly earmarked 
as counterparts to the capital, reserves and 
pension provisions. In the aggregated balance 
sheet of the Eurosystem, these portfolios, 
known as own funds portfolios, were included 
in other financial assets under what was then 
asset item 8 “Other assets”.8 Overall, other 
assets totalled €85 billion across the Eurosys -
tem at the beginning of EMU, with financial 
assets constituting a substantial portion.
Third, some NCBs held legacy positions in the 
form of long- term, marketable government 
5 For the sake of simplicity, a broad definition of reserve 
assets is applied, comprising asset items 1 “Gold and gold 
receivables”, 2 “Claims on non- euro- area residents denom -
inated in foreign currency” and 3 “Claims on euro- area resi -
dents denominated in foreign currency”. For an exact stat -
istical definition of reserve assets, see ECB (2000), Statistical 
treatment of the Eurosystem’s international reserves ( https://
www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/statintreservesen.pdf ).
6 Beginning on 1  July 1990, EMU was implemented in 
three stages. See https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/history/
emu/html/index.en.html . At the beginning of stage three of 
EMU on 1 January 1999, the euro was adopted as the sin -
gle currency and common monetary policy tasks conferred 
to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).
7 See ECB, Consolidated opening financial statement of 
the Eurosystem as at 1  January 1999 ( http://www.ecb.
europa.eu/press/pdf/wfs/ 1999/fs990101en.pdf ) as well as 
the corresponding notes ( http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/
pr/date/ 1999/html/pr990105_1.en.html ). Regarding asset 
item 6, it reads: “Partly related to previous monetary policy 
operations are also holdings of marketable securities issued 
by euro area residents and denominated in euro (asset item 
6) which amounted to €21.6 billion”. According to the bal -
ance sheet structure currently in place, this refers to asset 
item 7.2. The Bundesbank did not hold any such securities 
when it entered EMU; see the opening financial statement 
as at 1  January 1999 ( http://www.bundesbank.de/
Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publications/Annual_Report/ 
1998_annual_report.html ).
8 See ECB, op cit. The notes on asset item 8 state the fol -
lowing. “The position other assets is a collective item in -
cluding, in particular, […] and other financial assets (eg 
equity shares, participating interests, investment portfolios 
related to central banks’ own funds, pension funds and 
severance schemes or securities held due to statutory re -
quirements) […].” According to the balance sheet structure 
currently in place, own funds portfolios are recorded under 
the “Financial assets” sub- item of asset item 11. The Bun -
desbank did not hold an own funds portfolio when it 
entered EMU.Deutsche Bundesbank

bonds which had arisen from the conversion of 
former claims on the public sector which were 
non- marketable or did not meet market re -
quirements. The latter item was created as a 
result of the transition towards the require -
ments of Article 104 of the Maastricht Treaty 
(today Article 123 of the Treaty on the Func -
tioning of the European Union (TFEU)), which 
in 1994 prohibited central bank lending to gen -
eral government (ie the ban on the monetary 
financing of governments). Such bonds 
amounted to around €60 billion across the Eu -
rosystem and were recorded under asset item 7 
“General government debt in euro” in the ag -
gregated balance sheet of the Eurosystem.9 
The relevant member states committed to 
gradually scale back this debt vis- à- vis their re -
spective central banks by means of individually 
tailored reduction paths.
The historical background plays only a second -
ary role today given that the majority of Euro -
system central banks subsequently increased their non- monetary policy asset items, includ -
ing for general investment and income pur -
poses. Non- monetary policy asset items in the 
Eurosystem currently amount to around €1,400 
billion, constituting a share of just over 50% in 
consolidated total assets (see the adjacent 
chart).
ANFA allows the NCBs to manage their na -
tional portfolios autonomously. Ultimately, set -
ting up such portfolios provides central bank 
money to the banking system (ie creates liquid -
ity) as much as conducting monetary policy op -
erations does. The liquidity management of the 
Eurosystem is not negatively affected as long as 
interest rates and, in particular, the liquidity 
conditions in the market can be adequately 
steered using the available monetary policy 
tools.10 The liquidity provided in the context of 
non- monetary policy portfolios covers some of 
the euro- area banking system’s liquidity needs 
and is correspondingly accounted for in the 
context of the volume- based calibration of 
monetary policy operations with limited tender 
allotments. However, as a rule, it is not merely 
securities transactions but all on- balance sheet 
non- monetary policy operations of a central 
bank that affect the liquidity position of the ANFA designed 
to safeguard monetary policyMonetary policy and non-monetary policy assets of the Eurosystem

9 See ECB, op cit. The notes on asset item 7 state the fol -
lowing. “General government debt denominated in euro 
shows outstanding non-  marketable claims on euro area 
governments stemming from before 1 January 1994, from 
which date onwards EU NCBs could no longer provide 
credit facilities to governments or make direct purchases of 
debt instruments from governments. This debt will have to 
be redeemed by governments in due course.” According to 
the balance sheet structure currently in place, this corres -
ponds to asset item 8. When entering EMU, the Bundes -
bank had claims on the Federal Government worth around 
€4.4 billion, which were attributable to the currency re -
form in 1948. In conjunction with Article 104 of the Maas -
tricht Treaty, it was agreed that equalisation claims would 
be redeemed in ten annual instalments from 2024 onwards 
(see also Deutsche Bundesbank, Equalisation claims from 
the currency reform of 1948, and the Fund for the Pur -
chase of Equalisation Claims, Monthly Report, November 
1995, pages 55-69).

aim to ensure an orderly functioning of the money market 
and to help banks meet their liquidity needs in a smooth 
and well- organised manner. See Guideline (EU) 2015/ 510

banking sector. To prevent these operations 
from increasing the amount of liquidity in the 
market to an undesired extent from a monetary 
policy perspective, it is necessary to monitor 
any changes to non- monetary policy items.
As a result, a more comprehensive view of 
 liquidity effects from non-  monetary policy ac -
tivities developed in the early years of monetary 
union. In 2002, ie three years into monetary 
union, the ECB Governing Council decided that 
it would be beneficial if not only securities 
items denominated in euro but all non-  
monetary policy balance sheet items of NCBs 
were to be coordinated more closely in future. 
Hence, in order to safeguard monetary policy 
effectively, the Eurosystem NCBs and the ECB 
concluded the Agreement on Net Financial 
Assets (ANFA) at the beginning of 2003.
The role of ANFA in the 
 context of implementing 
monetary policy
A central bank is able to manage short- term 
interest rates in the market by offering commer -
cial banks monetary policy loans at a certain 
interest rate (ie the policy rate). The Eurosystem 
refers to such credit operations as liquidity-  
providing or refinancing operations. The com -
mercial banks have a particular interest in mak -
ing use of such operations whenever the bank -
ing system has what is called a structural liquid -
ity deficit vis- à- vis the Eurosystem.11 Together, 
central bank reserves and banknotes are what is 
known as central bank money. Banknotes in cir -
culation generally contribute to the banking 
system’s demand for liquidity. Cash withdrawals 
by bank customers force the commercial banks 
to obtain new cash from the central bank, 
which reduces their central bank reserves. 
Moreover, the minimum reserve requirement 
determined by the Eurosystem creates a de -
mand for liquidity by the banking system.
The implementation of monetary policy is es -
sentially to be achieved by means of a struc -tural liquidity deficit.12 A central bank can main -
tain an existing structural liquidity deficit by 
limiting the volume of non- monetary policy 
asset items on its balance sheet. Banknotes in 
circulation on the liabilities side represent a key 
determinant of the length of a central bank’s 
balance sheet as well as its growth over time. 
The volume of liquidity- providing monetary 
policy operations correspondingly changes on 
the assets side.13 If NCBs’ holdings of non-  
monetary policy securities had increased exces -
sively in the past, a structural liquidity surplus 
could have arisen in the euro area. Although 
the Eurosystem would be able even in such an 
environment to create a structural liquidity def -
icit by increasing minimum reserves or conduct -
ing structural liquidity- absorbing operations (eg 
by issuing central bank bonds), this would in -
crease the shared costs of the single monetary 
policy, while only the NCBs would benefit from 
the additional income from the national port -
folios.
A structural liquidity deficit makes it easier to 
steer short- term interest rates in monetary pol -
icy terms as it forces banks to turn to central 
bank funding. The exact size of the structural 
liquidity deficit needed to make this happen is 
determined for the euro area by the ECB Gov -
erning Council based on monetary policy con -Structural 
 liquidity deficit as the starting point for the Eurosystem’s implementation of monetary policySize of necessary structural liquid-ity deficit deter-mined based on monetary policy considerations
11 The banking system’s structural liquidity position vis- à- 
vis the Eurosystem can be calculated based on the central 
bank balance sheet. Whenever the volume of liquidity-  
absorbing factors (eg banknotes in circulation or minimum 
reserves) outweighs the volume of liquidity-  providing fac -
tors (ie autonomous factors and monetary policy securities 
portfolios), the banking system faces a structural liquidity 
deficit, which is then covered by the provision of monetary 
policy refinancing operations. See Deutsche Bundesbank, 
Structural liquidity position of the banking system, Monthly 
Report, June 2015, pp 36-37.
12 See Agreement of 19 November 2014 on Net Financial 
Assets. Preamble (1) states the following: “The implemen -
tation of the single monetary policy is more efficiently 
achieved if the euro area banking sector has a liquidity def -
icit vis- à- vis the Eurosystem. A Iiquidity deficit allows for the 
continuous provision of liquidity by way of Eurosystem 
monetary policy operations.”

siderations.14 As a general rule, central banks 
can cover a liquidity deficit in the banking sys -
tem by means of various monetary policy oper -
ations. As an alternative to liquidity- providing 
reverse operations, a central bank can also sup -
ply liquidity and reduce the liquidity deficit by 
buying longer- term securities outright. For ex -
ample, the US Federal Reserve System has, in 
the past, actively managed the banking sys -
tem’s structural liquidity position by buying and 
selling central government bonds on a daily 
basis.15 In principle, it would also be possible 
for the Eurosystem to manage the liquidity def -
icit using structural monetary policy operations 
such as conducting structural longer- term re -
verse operations or buying securities outright. 
However, for its part, the Eurosystem has not 
made use of this option.
In the light of the large volumes of securities 
purchased for monetary policy purposes under 
the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), 
the Eurosystem’s monetary policy has brought 
about a new state of affairs with respect to the 
banking system’s liquidity position – instead of 
the previous structural liquidity deficit, the bank -
ing system is running a structural liquidity sur -
plus. Targeted longer- term refinancing oper -
ations (TLTRO), which have a maturity of up to 
four years, have also supplied abundant liquidity 
and significantly expanded the Eurosystem’s 
consolidated balance sheet. These non- standard 
monetary policy measures are designed to influ -
ence price developments via various monetary 
transmission channels.16
Even against this backdrop, it is still necessary to 
limit the provision of liquidity from non-  
monetary policy operations. While ANFA’s for -
mer objective was, first and foremost, to main -
tain a structural liquidity deficit, its role in the 
current environment is to regulate the maximum 
permissible liquidity surplus determined based 
on monetary policy considerations.17 This en -
sures that the operational monetary policy ob -
jectives set by the ECB Governing Council relat -
ing to the balance sheet are achieved using monetary policy tools – and not via the non-  
monetary policy activities of the NCBs.
ANFA’s effects and 
 calibration mechanism
In order to ensure, in the specific context of 
EMU, the compatibility of the NCBs’ non-  
monetary policy activities with the Eurosystem’s 
single monetary policy, various rules were 
adopted.
ANFA imposes a general ceiling on the non-  
monetary policy balance sheet activities of 
NCBs in the Eurosystem. The NFA resulting 
from such activities comprise all of the Eurosys -
tem’s non- monetary policy asset items less its 
non- monetary policy liability items, with focus 
being placed on the aggregated liquidity  effects 
for the single currency area that arise from 
these items.
By contrast, individual transactions or types of 
transaction are governed not by ANFA but ra -
ther, inter alia , by the ECB Guideline on domes -
tic – that is to say, euro- denominated – asset 
and liability management operations by the 
NCBs (DALM Guideline).18 The DALM Guideline Paradigm shift

14 See Agreement of 19 November 2014 on Net Financial 
Assets, Preamble (2): “The liquidity deficit needs to be pre -
served at a Ievel that is sufficient to efficiently implement 
monetary policy and the Governing Council is competent 
to determine this Ievel.”
15 By contrast, the Bundesbank used to largely avoid build -
ing up a fairly substantial stock of long- term sovereign 
bonds so as to stifle any suspicions that it might be funding 
government budget deficits.

standard measures, see ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7,

17 See Agreement of 19 November 2014 on Net Financial

conducted with the explicit intention to actively create a 
Iiquidity surplus situation, the Governing Council may con -
sider setting a Eurosystem maximum liquidity surplus to be

18 See ECB, Guideline of the European Central Bank of 
20 February 2014 on domestic asset and liability manage -
ment operations by the national central banks, Preamble 
(1): “[…] when carrying out operations in domestic assets 
and liabilities on their own initiative, such operations 
should not interfere with the single monetary policy”

outlines various reporting and approval require -
ments for certain euro- denominated, non-  
monetary policy transactions conducted by the 
NCBs. The information generated in this man -
ner is intended to make it easier for the Euro -
system to manage the banking sector’s liquidity 
position, which, in turn, is key to the volume-  
based calibration of short- term monetary policy 
operations with limited tender allotments.19 
Furthermore, prior approval must be granted 
by the ECB in the case of non- monetary policy 
transactions to be conducted by NCBs with a 
net liquidity effect exceeding €200 million 
within one business day (see Article 7 (1) in 
conjunction with Article 8 and Annex I of the 
DALM Guideline). In addition, this guideline 
contains provisions stipulating that the remu -
neration of government deposits held with 
NCBs must be based on comparable market 
rates. One of the aims of this is to create incen -
tives for the public sector to invest these funds 
in the market, thereby streamlining the Euro -
system’s liquidity management.
ANFA governs, together with the monetary 
policy parameters laid down by the ECB Gov -
erning Council, the maximum permissible ag -
gregate amount of NFA held in the Eurosystem 
and distributes it to the NCBs. The annual dis -
tribution process (known as the calibration) in -
volves two steps.20
First, the aggregate amount of available NFA is 
defined and distributed to the NCBs in propor -
tion to their shares in the ECB’s capital key. 
These distributed amounts are known as an 
NCB’s NFA entitlements. Second, the NCBs 
provide information regarding the extent to 
which they plan to utilise this leeway, as there 
may be both central banks that plan to hold 
more NFA in the next year than the entitle -
ments distributed to them and those that plan 
to hold less than their entitlements. What 
therefore takes place, up to certain limits, is a 
temporary reallocation of unused leeway for 
holding NFA to those NCBs that wish to hold 
disproportionately high levels of NFA as meas -
ured by the ECB capital key. Should a central bank that has not made full use of its entitle -
ment wish to use it in subsequent years, it is 
able to do so under ANFA’s calibration mech -
anism. Additionally, a certain buffer remains for 
those NCBs that do not plan to use their full 
entitlements. This serves as a safety net in the 
event that expected holdings of NFA do turn 
out to be higher over the course of the year, 
which can, for instance, arise as a result of de -
velopments on the liability side of the central 
bank balance sheet that cannot be directly con -
trolled.
Ultimately arising from these two steps are the 
definitive NFA ceilings, which the NCBs are not 
allowed to exceed on an annual average. The 
calibration mechanism for NFA outlined above 
and the resulting setting of ceilings are in -
tended to ensure that the NCBs’ autonomy 
over their balance sheets – with respect to 
non- monetary policy operations – is not con -
strained beyond what can be justified by mon -
etary policy considerations. At the same time, 
however, it is ensured that NFA do not, on ag -
gregate, exceed the permissible aggregate 
amount determined based on monetary policy 
considerations.
Changes in NFA held  
by the Bundesbank
In the past, the Bundesbank held comparatively 
small quantities of NFA, which helped maintain 
a sufficient structural liquidity deficit for monet -
ary policy purposes. The NFA held by the Bun -
desbank were broadly stable in the period from 
2002 to 2010 and stood at an average of €46 
billion (see the chart on page 90). Starting in Annual ANFA 
calibration
Generally speak-ing, the Bundes-bank has com-paratively small holdings of NFA, …
19 Such a method of liquidity management in the Eurosys -
tem is of particular relevance with respect to calculating 
the benchmark allotment amount in main refinancing 
 operations. See https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/
implement/omo/pdf/How_to_calculate_the_benchmark.pdf . 
This applies especially in an environment in which  liquidity 
is allocated in limited volumes instead of on a fixed- rate full 
allotment basis. This was the case in the Euro  system until 
October 2008.

Assets, Article 2 in conjunction with Annex II.Deutsche Bundesbank

2011, the NFA held by the Bundesbank then fell 
considerably, ultimately reaching a negative 
average value of -€17 billion in 2015. As at the 
reporting date of 31  December 2015, their 
value stood at -€50 billion.
By comparison, the NFA held by the Eurosys -
tem (including the Bundesbank) rose continu -
ously between 2002 and 2011 from €267 bil -
lion to €600 billion. Thereafter, holdings 
slumped once again but still amounted to €490 
billion at the end of 2015.
Taking a look at the asset and liability positions 
of the Bundesbank’s balance sheet provides a 
more detailed insight into the changes in its 
NFA (see chart on page 91). The negative quan -
tity of NFA held by the Bundesbank at the end 
of 2015 was largely attributable to develop -
ments on the liability side, which are beyond its 
direct control. These include changes in the 
euro- denominated deposits of non- euro- area 
institutions and central banks as well as in gov -
ernment deposits and the deposits of other 
 financial intermediaries in the euro area. For ex -
ample, the euro- denominated deposits of non- 
euro- area institutions and central banks21 
doubled over the course of 2015 to €27 billion. 
This development was accompanied by a con -
tinuous rise in government deposits and the 
deposits of other financial intermediaries,22 the volume of which stood at €72 billion as at 
31 December 2015. This increase resulted pri -
marily from higher deposits made by the Fed -
eral Government, the Financial Market Stabil -
isation Agency and the European Stability 
Mechanism.
The largest item comprising NFA on the asset 
side of the Bundesbank’s balance sheet in 2015 
was reserve assets (€160 billion), consisting of 
gold,23 foreign exchange reserves and claims 
on the International Monetary Fund.24 On the 
liability side, these asset items were offset to a 
large extent by revaluation accounts25 amount -
ing to €106 billion. If, for instance, there is a 
change in the price of gold (and thus in the 
value of the Bundesbank’s gold holdings), the 
revaluation accounts are also adjusted, which 
means that such valuation adjustments have 
no effect on the total volume of NFA. Addition -
ally, the Bundesbank’s assets include a non-  
monetary policy euro portfolio,26 which, at 
amortised cost, totalled €12.3 billion as at 
31 December 2015. Of these, German Pfand -
briefe accounted for €9.6 billion and French 
covered bonds for €2.7 billion. These securities 
constitute a counterpart to the capital, statu -
tory reserves, provisions for general risks and 
long- term provisions for pension commitments 
and healthcare subsidy commitments for civil 
servants.27 Apart from that, the Bundesbank 
holds no further euro- denominated securities 
for investment purposes.28… which fluctu-

Comparatively speaking, the non- monetary 
policy securities portfolios of other Eurosystem 
NCBs tend to be larger in scope and therefore 
also have a greater impact on changes in these 
central banks’ NFA.
As previously outlined, the NFA held by the 
Bundesbank are currently being heavily influ -
enced by deposit business and, to this extent, 
cannot be precisely controlled. If monetary pol -
icy were to normalise, possibly bringing with it 
improvements in the conditions for investing 
on the money market, it could be expected 
that non-  bank deposits held with the Bundes -
bank, which are quite high at times, would 
likely go back down. Viewed purely with re -
spect to the balance sheet, this would result in 
the NFA held by the Bundesbank rising, with 
the potential for values to once again venture 
into positive territory in the future.Non- monetary policy 
 securities portfolios of the 
NCBs and the prohibition 
of monetary financing of 
governments 
The recent public debate on holdings of non-  
monetary policy securities saw the Eurosystem 
central banks lambasted by some quarters 
owing to a lack of transparency. For instance, 
non- monetary policy securities purchases (par -
ticularly of domestic government bonds) made 
by the individual NCBs were linked to monetary 
financing, which is prohibited by the European Components and structure of the Deutsche Bundesbank’s net financial assets on the 
asset and liability side of the balance sheet

Treaties29 – with emphasis on the extent to 
which such portfolios grew as the European 
sovereign debt crisis unfolded.
As a matter of fact, NCBs do report on the type 
and composition of their non- monetary policy 
securities portfolios with varying degrees of de -
tail. Transparency has logical limits – for ex -
ample, allowing a false impression to arise that 
individual issuers enjoy a special amount of 
trust from central banks would be undesirable 
if some of the securities that they issue are also 
held by central banks. On the flip side, the pub -
lic is justified in scrutinising the balance sheets 
and financial statements of Eurosystem central 
banks and in calling for more detailed explan -
ations in areas where clarity and transparency 
may be in short supply. This is perfectly legitim -
ate and a sign of a functioning democratic pol -
ity. For its part, the ECB monitors and regularly 
reports on compliance with the prohibition of 
monetary financing.30
The debate on non- monetary policy bond pur -
chases by NCBs, which has garnered a com -
paratively high amount of attention in Ger -
many, illustrates once again that, the greater 
their scope and the lower the transparency per -
ceived by third parties with respect to the mo -
tives and objectives behind specific securities 
purchases, the greater the level of detail that 
needs to be provided by central banks in a 
monetary union when purchasing government 
bonds.
Despite all of the objectively justified criticism 
and the public debate on appropriate monet -
ary policy measures to be undertaken by the 
Eurosystem and on the non- monetary policy 
activities of the NCBs, there should neverthe -
less be a consensus that the Eurosystem, like 
any other central bank, needs to be able to ac -
quire assets – including credit claims and secur -
ities – in order to influence the liquidity needs 
of the banking system and achieve monetary 
policy objectives above and beyond these 
needs, as necessary.Conclusion
ANFA is a contractual agreement between the 
central banks of the Eurosystem – that is, the 
NCBs and the ECB. It is a self- limitation meas -
ure that serves to ensure the efficient imple -
mentation of monetary policy. ANFA takes into 
account a unique feature of European monet -
ary union: the fact that the NCBs continue to 
perform tasks at the national level. In the light 
of the primacy of monetary policy, ANFA is a 
useful tool to ensure that the operations con -
ducted by the NCBs based on national legisla -
tion are compatible with the objectives of the 
Eurosystem in terms of its single monetary pol -
icy. Irrespective of this contractual agreement, 
the ECB Governing Council has the right, at any 
time, to object to NCBs performing national 
functions if the Governing Council determines 
that these are incompatible with the objectives 
and tasks of the Eurosystem.
The decision to publish ANFA demonstrates the 
determination of Eurosystem central banks to 
be more transparent about their actions. Within 
the scope of the autonomy that they have 
been granted over their balance sheets, the Eu -
rosystem NCBs are themselves able to decide 
to what extent they wish to publish details on 
the composition of their non-  monetary policy 
assets and liabilities. In this regard, it is worth 
considering what can be published in the inter -
est of transparency without revealing confiden -ANFA as a useful 
voluntary self- limitation meas-ure to safeguard monetary policy
ANFA publication  
as a further stage of increased  transparency
29 Pursuant to Article 123 of the TFEU, the ECB and the 
NCBs are not permitted to buy sovereign bonds on the pri -
mary market. Furthermore, as also clarified in Council 
Regulation (EC) No 3603/ 93, purchases of sovereign bonds 
on the secondary market may not be used to circumvent 
the objectives of this ban, and the acquisition of sovereign 
bonds on the secondary market may not, in practice, have 
the same effect as the direct acquisition of sovereign bonds 
on the primary market. For more information, see also ECJ, 
case C-62/ 14, Gauweiler, paragraphs 97 ff. The objective of 
the prohibition of monetary financing is, in particular, to 
encourage member states to pursue a sound fiscal policy.
