5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a whole
The German economy grew at a faster pace
in the third quarter of 2007. Overall economic
output rose by 0.7% after adjustment for
seasonal and calendar effects, compared with
0.3% in the second quarter. Thus, the expan-
sionary cyclical forces again became more
prominent in the third quarter, whereas eco-
nomic growth in the first half of the year had
been hampered by dampening effects in con-
nection with the VAT increase.
Growth was increasingly driven by domestic
demand in the third quarter. Private con-
sumption expenditure, for example, went up
by 0.5%, which was due primarily to the in-
crease in sales of new passenger cars. There
was a further increase in investment in ma-
chinery and equipment as well, not least as a
result of the high level of industrial capacity
utilisation; however, the increase was 0.4%
weaker than in previous quarters. Stimulus in
the third quarter was also generated by con-
struction investment, which was 0.6% up on
the second quarter. Construction investment
had also been rather subdued in the first half
of the year owing to the rise in VAT. More-
over, changes in inventories contributed posi-
tively to economic growth after the signifi-
cant dampening effects in the second quar-
ter. In this context, however, there was also a
sharp rise in imports (3.9%), which was even
slightly more pronounced than the strong
growth in exports (3.1%), with the result
that, in arithmetical terms, net exports madeThird-quarter
GDP

to growth.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in Octo-
ber was more or less as high as in September.
At the beginning of the fourth quarter, it was
3/C254% up on the average of the third quarter.
Among the individual sectors, the capital
goods industry, and especially mechanical en-
gineering, was the only sector to record an in-
crease in output.
The seasonally adjusted number of new
orders in October was, however, 4% up on
the month. The sharp increase is all the more
remarkable given that the figure for Septem-
ber was revised significantly upwards. De-
mand for industrial products therefore re-
gained momentum at the beginning of the
fourth quarter after experiencing a less buoy-
ant period in the third quarter. There was a
particularly sharp rise in export demand; at
5%, it went up almost twice as sharply as
orders placed by domestic customers.
The value of exports of goods in October was
up slightly on the month. Compared with the
third-quarter average, this constitutes an in-
crease of 13/C254%. At the same time, imports re-
mained at virtually the same level as in the
previous month, roughly matching the aver-
age of the third quarter. The trade surplus
went up to 3181/C254billion in October.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Construction
Construction output in October was1/C254%u p
on the month and was thus 11/C254% higher than
the average of the third quarter. While outputin the civil engineering sector remained virtu-ally unchanged quarter on quarter, output inthe construction sector went up by 2
1/C254%.
Construction demand in September – more
recent figures are not yet available – showedlittle improvement on the depressed level ofthe previous month. In the third quarter as awhole, the volume of orders was 1
1/C252% down
on the second quarter with civil engineeringand construction both being affected by thedownturn. Industrial enterprises were reluc-tant to place new orders in the third quarter,while the public sector increased its volumeof orders somewhat compared with thesecond quarter. Demand for housing con-struction remained weak.
Labour marketThe positive trend in the labour market con-
tinued in October. According to initial esti-mates by the Federal Statistical Office, theseasonally adjusted number of persons in em-ployment rose by 33,000 to 39.88 million.The year-on-year increase amounted to682,000. Employment subject to social secur-ity contributions also continued to expand ata robust pace, going up by 42,000 in Septem-ber. By contrast, the number of persons work-ing exclusively in low-paid part-time jobs de-clined slightly. The sharp rise in the FederalEmployment Agency’s BA-X index for non-government-assisted jobs indicated that en-terprises were still very willing to recruit new
staff. The fact that short-time working fell toa very low level in the third quarter of 2007was consistent with this favourable picture.
Given this positive background, there was a
further reduction in unemployment. In No-vember, the number of persons out of workdeclined by a seasonally adjusted 53,000 to3.6 million. The year-on-year decrease was617,000. After elimination of seasonal fac-tors, the unemployment rate stood at 8.6%.The figure one year earlier had been as highas 10.1%.
PricesThere was a sharp rise in prices in the inter-
national crude oil markets in November. On amonthly average, the spot quotation for abarrel of Brent North Sea oil reached a newrecord high at US$92
1/C254. However, oil prices
eased again towards the end of the monthand have continued to do so in December,with the correction in the spot markets beingmore marked than on the futures exchanges.As this report went to press, the price ofBrent crude oil for prompt delivery stood atUS$92
3/C254. The discount applied to medium-
term supplies (six-month contracts) wasUS$1
1/C254. On longer-term contracts (18
months), it was US$41/C254.
In October, seasonally adjusted import prices
were 1.0% up on the month and 2.3% upon the year. The more rapid pace of increasewas due mainly to the higher energy prices.Excluding energy, price movements remainedwithin narrow bounds. Industrial producerConstruction

1.7% on the year.
There was a further sharp rise in seasonally
adjusted consumer prices in November; they
went up by 0.6% on the month. There was a
sharp rise, above all, in the cost of heating oil
and fuel. Much the same applies to food
prices. Consumers had to pay more for indus-
trial goods and services as well. The annual
rate of change in the national consumer price
index (CPI) went up from 2.4% in October to
3.1%. According to the Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP), the year-on-year in-
crease was as much as 3.3%, compared with
2.7% in October.
Public finances1
Updated stability programme
On 5 December 2007, the Federal Cabinet
endorsed an updated stability programme for
the period up to 2011 and, under the Euro-
pean budgetary surveillance procedure, trans-
mitted it to the ECOFIN Council and the Euro-
pean Commission. Concerning the projected
overall economic development, the Federal
Government is proceeding on the assumption
that on a calendar year basis, ie not adjusted
for working days, real gross domestic product
(GDP) will grow by 2.4% in 2007 and by 2%
in 2008. The deviation from the normal state
of the economy, measured in terms of the
output gap, which is reported in the stability
programme as being slightly positive already
in 2007, will widen a little more in 2008.
However, for the following years up to 2011a growth rate of 11/C252%, which is somewhat
less than the increase in potential output as-
sumed by the Federal Government (13/C254%),
and a convergence towards the normal state
of the economy are expected. At 2% from
2009, the increase in the compensation of
employees, which is a key variable for general
government revenue from tax and contribu-
tions, is being estimated rather cautiously.
A balanced general government budget is an-
ticipated for 2007. Following the deterior-
ation in 2008 caused by the business tax re-
form and the lowering of the contribution
rate to the Federal Employment Agency, an
improvement is forecasted for the following
years, so that from 2010 a small surplus is en-
visaged. The expected fall in the revenue ratio
should be more than matched by moderate
expenditure growth. In structural terms, ie
after adjustment for cyclical effects and tem-
porary measures, the picture is similar. In par-
ticular, the Federal Government’s medium-
term objective of achieving a structurally bal-
anced budget is to be achieved by 2010 at
the latest. Thus Germany will have complied
with the Eurogroup’s resolution of April 2007,
under which the member states of the mon-
etary union committed themselves to strive to
achieve their medium-term objectives by
2010. However, a renewed structural deficit
of1/C252% of GDP is planned for 2008, after a
structurally balanced budget should be al-

9most achieved in 2007. In 2010 the debt
ratio should fall below the reference value of60% defined in the EC Treaty. Overall, theplanned development of public finances atthe current juncture is thus significantly morefavourable than predicted in the December2006 stability programme. The main reasonfor this is the more favourable expectationswith regard to the 2007 fiscal balance. This isnow predicted to improve by 1
1/C252% of GDP
vis-/C224-vis the previous forecast as a result ofthe more positive assessment of macroeco-nomic developments, the lower deficit ratioin 2006 than initially expected and the unex-pectedly strong increase in revenue fromprofit-related taxes.
The planned development under the updated
stability programme would mean that theEuropean requirements (observing the deficit
and debt ratio reference values, achieving themedium-term budgetary objectives) would bemet in 2010 without having to invoke exemp-tion clauses, which is to be welcomed. Onecause for concern, however, is that a certaindeterioration in the budgetary position is en-visaged for 2008, although the plans for thecoming year assume a fairly favourable eco-nomic environment. Furthermore, revenuefrom profit-related taxes is likely to be at anabove-average level at present and thereforethere is a significant danger of a counter-swing.
2Therefore, the stability programme
rightly emphasises that the consolidation pol-icy must be continued. Resolute adherence tothis requirement could avoid the planned def-Key data of the Federal Government’s updated stability programme

chronic deficits from occurring after painstak-
ingly achieving consolidation. The Federal
Government has a particular responsibility in
this matter, because it is the only level of gov-
ernment that is not aiming for a balanced
budget until 2011.
Statutory health insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance institutions re-
corded an almost balanced result in the third
quarter, just as they did in 2006. By compari-
son, the result in the second quarter – after
adjustment for the cut in the Federal grant3–
had improved by just over 31/C252billion. The in-
crease in expenditure continued to accelerate
during the third quarter and reached just over
5% on the year. The expenditure curbs of theAct improving cost efficiency in pharmaceut-
icals supply ( Gesetz zur Verbesserung der
Wirtschaftlichkeit in der Arzneimittelversor-
gung ), which came into force on 1 May
2006, are diminishing increasingly in the
year-on-year comparisons. Furthermore, the
Act to promote competition among statutory
health insurance institutions ( GKV-
Wettbewerbsst/C228rkungsgesetz ), which was
approved in spring, has so far likewise not led
to any appreciable easing of the financial situ-
ation of the health insurance institutions. Just
over one-quarter of the 9.5% growth in ex-
penditure on pharmaceuticals is, however,
due to the rise in the standard rate of turn-
over tax. At just over 11/C252%, expenditure on
hospital treatment (which is the largest single
cost item, accounting for one-third of the
total) expanded at a below-average rate.4By
contrast, expenditure on healthcare promo-
tion surged by 74%. Vaccinations, which had
become mandatory benefits under the last
healthcare reform, played a major role in this.
However, the strong growth in expenditure
was offset by an even stronger rise in revenue
of almost 51/C252%, which was entirely due to
the marked increase in contribution receipts
(just over 51/C252%). The sharp increase in contri-
bution rates to 14.8% on average (including
the special contribution paid by insured per-
sons of 0.9%) resulted per se in increased rev-
enue from contributions of almost 4%. In-Quarterly

in the final quarter.

11come subject to compulsory insurance (basic
wage total) grew by 11/C252%.
In the first three quarters of the year, there
was a small surplus of just under 31/C254billion.
Compared with 2006, this amounts to a fi-nancial improvement of almost 3
1/C252billion. In
the fourth quarter, a clear surplus is tradition-ally expected, owing to extra contributionsfrom end-of-year bonus payments. Further-more, the at present favourable employmentand pay trends will have a positive impact onthe revenue side. However, it should be re-membered that the increase in expenditurehas accelerated and that the second instal-ment of the Federal grant will be 30.85 billion
lower than 12 months previously. Overall, thehealth insurance institutions could thusachieve a surplus of a similar size to that re-corded in 2006 (just under 32 billion). This is
still needed in part to reduce the debt of indi-vidual health insurance institutions, but it willalso be used in part to increase the statutoryreserves. However, as stipulated in an exemp-tion clause, the remaining health insuranceinstitutions have until the end of 2008 toclear their debts, thus coinciding with theplanned introduction of the healthcare fund.If there is another sharp rise in expenditure,the surplus will largely be used up in the com-ing year unless there are further increases inthe contribution rate.
Public long-term care insurance schemeThe public long-term care insurance institu-
tions recorded a combined deficit of just over3
1/C252billion in the first three quarters of 2007.
By contrast, a surplus of 31/C254billion was gen-erated in the same period of 2006. However,
the 2006 financial outturn was distorted byone-off revenue windfalls resulting from theadvancement of the transfer deadlines for so-cial contributions. With that exceptional fac-tor stripped out, the underlying loss-makingperformance of the public long-term care in-surance scheme has now become more ap-parent again. Total revenue fell by just over4%, due to the baseline effect, while expend-iture increased by just over 1
1/C252%. The liquid
reserves fell to just below 33 billion.
As part of the reform of the public long-term
care insurance scheme, there are plans to in-crease the contribution rate in mid-2008from 1.7% to 1.95% (plus the special contri-bution of 0.25% for childless persons). Bene-fit rates are to be simultaneously increasedQuarterly

12for the first time since the public long-term
care insurance scheme was introduced in
1995. Furthermore, the range of benefits is
to be extended overall (eg for people suffer-
ing from dementia). From 2014, the long-
term care benefit rates are to be reviewed
every three years to see whether they should
be adjusted in line with cumulative price de-
velopments. However, the expansion of the
benefits is not to exceed the increase in nom-
inal wages and salaries per employee. Al-
though the additional revenue will exceed the
additional expenditure in the first few years
and thus temporarily allow reserves to be
built up, it is foreseeable that expenditure will
rise more rapidly than income subject to con-
tributions in the long term. Given the demo-
graphic developments, future contribution
rate increases are inevitable following the
fundamental policy decision to dynamise
benefit rates.5
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market
increased markedly in October, with gross
sales amounting to 3142.0 billion, compared
with 3110.1 billion in September. After de-
ducting redemptions and taking account of
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds, net sales of domestic securities came
to328.4 billion, following a decline in the vol-
ume of circulation of 36.5 billion in Septem-
ber. Foreign debt securities totalling 314.5 bil-
lion (net) were placed in the German market.Securities issued by credit institutions, with a
total value of 316.4 billion, accounted for the
bulk of the inflow of resources in October
after credit institutions reduced their market
debt by 33.0 billion in the preceding month.
They chiefly issued other bank debt securities,
which can be structured especially flexibly,
(312.5 billion) and debt securities of special-
ised credit institutions ( 35.5 billion). The out-
standing volume of mortgage Pfandbriefe
also increased ( 30.6 billion). By contrast, pub-
lic Pfandbriefe were redeemed in the amount
of32.2 billion net.
The public sector increased its bond market
debt by 38.4 billion, after lowering it by 32.4
billion in September. State governments bor-
rowed 34.5 billion on the bond market in Oc-
tober. Central government, which accounted
for33.8 billion of the total, issued five-year
Federal notes (Bobls) and two-year Federal
Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) with a total value of
35.9 billion and 35.0 billion respectively. It
concurrently redeemed ten-year Federal bonds
(Bunds) on balance to the value of 36.0 bil-
lion. The amount of short-dated Treasury dis-
count paper (Bubills) outstanding decreased
by30.7 billion, while the circulation of Fed-
eral Treasury financing paper and 30-year
Bunds fell in each case by a marginal 30.1 bil-
lion.
Domestic enterprises, too, increased their
bond market debt by 33.6 billion. They issued
solely short-term commercial paper on bal-

corporate bonds worth 32.2 billion net.
Debt securities on the German market were
purchased primarily by foreign investors inOctober ( 343.6 billion). German banks pur-
chased domestic and foreign debt securitiesworth 323.2 billion. By contrast, German
non-banks reduced their bond holdings by324 billion, whereby they mainly sold domes-
tic securities.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
likewise increased in October. Overall, Ger-man enterprises sold equities with a marketvalue of 32.0 billion (in September 30.5 bil-
lion), which almost exclusively comprised list-ed securities. Sales of foreign shares amount-ed to 35.8 billion net. On the buyers’ side,
German non-banks increased their sharehold-ings by 38.1 billion, purchasing mainly do-
mestic stocks. Domestic credit institutionsadded equities with a total net value of 33.6
billion to their portfolios. By contrast, foreigninvestors redeemed German shares worth33.9 billion, which reflected the decrease in
portfolio investment.
Mutual fund sharesIn October, domestic mutual funds recorded
inflows of 31.6 billion compared with out-
flows of 33.8 billion in September. Only spe-
cialised funds reserved for institutional invest-ors received inflows ( 33.0 billion), while funds
open to the general public registered out-flows of 31.4 billion. Of the mutual fundsopen to the general public, open-end real es-
tate funds forfeited 31.4 billion, money mar-
ket funds 31.1 billion and bond-based funds
30.7 billion as a result of the decline in invest-
ment. In contrast, mixed securities fundswere able to sell shares with a total value of31.1 billion. Mixed funds and share-based
funds, too, offloaded shares worth 30.4 bil-
lion and 30.3 billion respectively. Foreign
funds saw an inflow of 37.4 billion.
Mutual fund shares were purchased almost
entirely by non-banks ( 311.1 billion), which
invested largely in foreign funds. By contrast,credit institutions reduced their mutual fundportfolios by 32.2 billion.Sales and purchases

14Balance of payments
In October, the German current account re-
corded a surplus – in unadjusted terms – of
313.7 billion. The result was thus 31.7 billion
down on the level of the previous month. The
widening of the deficit on invisible current
transactions, which comprise services, in-
come and current transfers, had a stronger
impact than the rise in the trade surplus.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in October the foreign
trade surplus went up by 30.6 billion on the
month to 318.7 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar variations, it rose by
31/C252billion to 3181/C254billion. The value of ex-
ports of goods (1/C252%) increased by more than
nominal imports (1/C254%). Compared with the
average of the third quarter, seasonally ad-
justed exports rose by 13/C254%; even after the
elimination of price effects, there was still a
clear increase. Imports remained almost un-
changed from the third quarter; in real terms,
however, they declined.
Compared with September, the deficit on in-
visible current transactions increased in Octo-
ber by 32.2 billion to 34.4 billion. This was
due to the increase in the deficit on current
transfers to 35.1 billion compared with a def-
icit of 32.8 billion in the previous month. By
contrast, the deficit on services remained al-
most unchanged ( 32.6 billion). Net receipts
from cross-border income increased by 30.1
billion to 33.3 billion.

corded net capital imports in October. AtMajor items of the balance

15316.2 billion, these were almost twice as high
as in September ( 38.6 billion). This was due
to an increase in non-residents’ investment inGerman paper ( 339.4 billion after 311.1 bil-
lion previously). They purchased mostly debtsecurities ( 343.6 billion), primarily public sec-
tor (320.9 billion) and private sector ( 317.9
billion) bonds; however, there was also de-mand for money market paper ( 34.8 billion).
By contrast, foreign investors sold domesticshares ( 34.3 billion), as in the previous
month. German investors’ portfolio invest-ment abroad also increased in October (from32.6 billion to 323.2 billion). Debt securities
were at the centre of this, too. However, pur-chases were focused on short-term paper(311.0 billion) whereby transactions by credit
institutions accounted for a large proportionof this amount. Residents were also interest-ed in foreign mutual fund shares ( 37.4 bil-
lion), bonds and notes ( 33.5 billion) and
shares ( 31.3 billion). Outside the field of port-
folio investment, financial derivative transac-tions generated net outflows of 315.2 billion.
These can probably be attributed in part tothe net inflows arising from debt securitytransactions and serve hedging purposes.Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports of 34.8 billion in October (compared
with 33.0 billion in September). German
firms provided their foreign affiliates withadditional funds of 37.1 billion, exclusively in
the form of equity capital. Non-resident en-terprises increased their direct investment inGermany only slightly ( 32.3 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, which
comprises financial and trade credits as wellas bank deposits and other assets, recordednet capital exports ( 323.9 billion). Non-banks’
transactions recorded outflows totalling 318.6
billion. This was due predominantly to the ac-tivities of enterprises and households, whichled to net capital exports of 325.3 billion –
mainly as a result of a sharp increase in de-posits with foreign banks. Net funds of 35.3
billion flowed abroad via the domestic bank-ing system. While the non-securitised externaloperations of the credit institutions generatedinflows of 310.5 billion, the external position
of the Bundesbank rose by 315.8 billion.

17Outlook for the
German economy:
macroeconomic
projections for
2008 and 2009The German economy remains on a
sound upturn path which is quite
broadly based on the demand side,
and which may be seen as relatively
employment-intensive. This basic under-
lying trend will be maintained in the
next two years, although the pace
of growth is likely to be slower, at
somewhat less than 2% annually in
non-working-day-adjusted terms.
The price climate has deteriorated vis-
ibly during the current year. The aver-
age annual rate of HICP inflation will
probably amount to 2.3% in 2008 – as
in 2007, in which fiscal measures made
a contribution of some 11/C252percentage
points. In 2009, however, the inflation
rate could slow down to 1.5%, pro-
vided that crude oil prices tend to ease
in line with market expectations, the
increase in agricultural prices does not
continue beyond the middle of 2008,
and the present sharp upward pressure
on prices is not used by wage policy-
makers as an occasion for higher nego-
tiated pay rates.
Owing to these assumptions, the up-
side risks to prices predominate towards
the end of the projection period when
compared with the baseline projec-
tion. By contrast, the main risks to real
economic developments, which lie pri-
marily in the international setting and
a fairly large loss of purchasing power,
are on the downside.

18Preliminary remarks
The macroeconomic projections for Germany
for 2008 and 2009, the main results of which
are presented in this article, are an integral
part of the projections for the euro area pre-
pared by Eurosystem staff.1The results of
these projections for the euro area are incorp-
orated into the assessment of economic de-
velopments and the risks to price stability
undertaken by the Governing Council of the
ECB for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy
strategy. The ECB began publishing these
projections in December 2000.2The main
reasons for this were to create greater trans-
parency and to improve communication with
the general public.
In this report, the Bundesbank is publishing
its contribution to the euro-area projections
for the first time and thereby extending the
range of information it provides. The projec-
tion was completed on 23 November 2007.
The projection framework
The projection is based on a number of as-
sumptions which are determined – insofar as
they concern the global economic setting and
the euro area – jointly by Eurosystem staff.
These include, in particular, the assumptions
about future interest rates, exchange rates,
crude oil prices and world trade. These as-
sumptions highlight the typical conditional
nature of economic projections.
In addition to forecasting the most probable
development (baseline projections), assessingboth qualitative and quantitative risks is a key
part of the macroeconomic projections. This
concerns not only the above-mentioned ex-
ogenous assumptions but also other factors
of uncertainty associated with point esti-
mates. In line with the Bundesbank’s stability
policy mandate, particular attention is paid to
price risks.
Major assumptions
With regard to exchange rates, the assump-
tion specified by the Governing Council of
the ECB is that the euro’s exchange rate
against the US dollar will remain constant
during the projection period at its average
level during the first half of November of
US$1.46, compared with an average ex-
change rate of US$1.37 to the euro for 2007.
Against the 24 most important trading part-
ners of the euro area, an effective euro ex-
change rate of more than 21/C252% above the
2007 level is anticipated.
For the assumptions about interest rates, the
market expectations observed in the first half
of November are used. This “snapshot”
shows short-term interest rates, measured by
the three-month EURIBOR, at 4.5% on an
average of 2008 and at 4.3% in 2009. The
market assessment of the long-term govern-

letin. Furthermore, in its Monthly Bulletin for March and

19ment bond yields in Germany indicates a flat
profile with average annual figures of 4.1% in
2008 and 4.2% in 2009.
Corporate bond spreads increased perceptibly
in summer – albeit from a decidedly low level
– owing to the turbulence in the financial
markets. The projection is based on the as-
sumption of slightly greater spreads for bank
loans throughout the forecasting horizon,
which means that it costs the enterprises
somewhat more to raise funds.
Based on forward quotations, an annual aver-
age oil price of US$88.6 per barrel of Brent
crude oil was used as the basis of the Eurosys-
tem projection for 2008. For 2009, a decline
to an average of US$83.7 was assumed. In
US dollar terms, the other commodity prices
(excluding energy) are assumed to go up in
2008 by just under 9% compared with the
average for 2007 and to increase by a further
41/C252% in 2009.
With regard to the development of the world
economy, the projection is based on the as-
sumption that the rates of global growth will
slow down from a very high level to roughly
43/C254% annually during the forecasting hori-
zon. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the
calendar-adjusted volume of global trade will
increase in 2008 and 2009 by 61/C252% and 7%
respectively, compared with just over 6% in
2007.
In public finances, all measures which have
been adopted or which have already been
specified in sufficient detail and are likely to
be adopted were taken into consideration.This applies, in particular, to the business tax
reform in 2008, the reduction in the contribu-
tion rate to the Federal Employment Agency
to 3.3% and the extension of the period of
entitlement to unemployment benefit I for
older workers at the beginning of 2008.
Cyclical outlook
The cyclical upturn of the German economy
continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter
of 2007. Compared with the second quarter,
overall economic output increased by 0.7%
after seasonal and working-day adjustment
and was 2.5% up on the year in calendar-
adjusted terms. There had been a noticeable
slowdown in the pace of growth in the first
half of 2007, which was due mainly to theMajor assumptions of the projection

20contractionary fiscal impulse generated by
the increase in value-added tax as of 1 January
2007, which affected private consumption in
particular. On a half-year comparison, annual-
ised economic growth was 2.3% compared
with 3.8% in the second half of 2006, during
which it had benefited from anticipatory ef-
fects in connection with the increase in VAT.
Conditions for a continuation of the upswing
remain positive, even though the pace of
growth will become slower during the fore-
casting horizon. Given the recent turbulence
in the financial markets, a certain weakening
of global economic momentum may be ex-
pected in the coming year. This will affect
Germany at a time when the domestic econ-
omy – supported, not least, by an improve-
ment in major growth fundamentals – is in
quite robust shape. This is confirmed by busi-
ness sentiment indicators. Much points to the
domestic forces of growth gaining in import-
ance. Investment in machinery and equip-
ment is likely to continue its upward trend, al-
though it will fail to match the strong growth
of 2007. The ongoing high level of capacity
utilisation in the economy could particularly
benefit commercial construction investment,
much of which is for capacity extensions.
Only minor recovery potential is identifiable in
housing construction, however. Given a con-
tinuation of the favourable development in
the labour market, private consumption is
likely to gain momentum once the dampen-
ing fiscal effects have receded. Overall, the
most probable scenario is that of the classical
upswing, in which the initial spark is provided
by exports, investment is stepped up in thesecond stage, and, finally, private consump-
tion picks up, too.
Based on the indicators available up to No-
vember, we assume a rather moderate ex-
pansion in overall economic activity for the
final quarter of 2007. In particular, the decline
in purchasing power due to recent devel-
opments in consumer prices might have a
dampening impact on private consumption.
The external sector will probably make a ra-
ther minor positive contribution to growth.
Overall, the German economy is therefore
likely to start the new year only with moder-
ate momentum.
In the first half of 2008, the economy will re-
main on a growth path, initially at a reduced
pace. Above all, corporate investment is likely
to weaken temporarily owing to the anticipa-
tory effects in connection with the temporary
easing of depreciation requirements. By con-
trast, private consumer demand is likely to
become increasingly buoyant in view of the
continuing improvement in the labour market
situation. From the second half of 2008,
there is then the prospect of quarterly real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth return-
ing to figures in the vicinity of1/C252%. On an an-
nual average in calendar-adjusted terms, we
expect a rise of 1.6% for 2008 and of 2.0%
for 2009. This means that, in the coming
year, the German economy will probably
grow roughly in line with potential output.
Total output is likely to expand noticeably
more strongly again in 2009. Owing to the
differing number of working days, real GDP
will increase by 1.9% in non-working-day-
adjusted terms in each of the two years.... continues at

21Exports will remain a major provider of stimu-
lus to the German economy throughout theforecasting horizon. Owing to their overall fa-vourable price competitiveness and the widerange of products offered, German exportersexpanded their market share once again in2007. The appreciation of the euro meansthat their market position will probably showonly minor improvement in 2008, however. Innon-working-day-adjusted terms, we expectan increase in real exports of goods and ser-vices of 6
3/C254% in 2008 and of 61/C254% in 2009.
Given a projected rise in real aggregate de-mand of some 3
1/C252% for each of those years,
real imports are likely to go up by 7% in 2008and 6
3/C254% in 2009. This means that net ex-
ports will make a positive mathematical con-tribution to growth, although, at
1/C254percent-
age point per year, it will be noticeably small-er than in 2007.
Gross fixed capital formation will remain a
major mainstay of economic growth duringthe forecasting horizon. Given the high levelof capacity utilisation in manufacturing, in-vestment in capacity extension, in particular,will record a sharp increase. Even a moderatedeterioration in external financing conditionswill not pose an obstacle to this, especially asstrong profitability means that German enter-prises can tap a large pool of accumulated in-ternal funds and have an improved base ofcapital and reserves.
3In the case of machin-
ery and equipment – with the temporary in-crease in the declining-balance depreciationrate expiring at the end of 2007 – there willbe a temporary slowdown in the expansion in2008. Commercial construction will continueto rise during the forecasting horizon. In viewof the generally comfortable financial situ-
ation in the public sector, government invest-ment is likely to be stepped up considerably.The potential for recovery in housing con-struction will remain quite constrained, how-ever.

22demand for construction. On the other hand,
the higher construction and financing costs
also mean that new housing construction is
likely to be subdued at best.
Including other investment, which chiefly in-
cludes software which has been bought-in or
produced in-house, gross fixed capital forma-
tion could increase by roughly 3% per year.
The total capital stock, which is a major indi-
cator of future growth opportunities, was
growing – if housing is excluded – at no more
than 11/C254% latterly. During the forecasting
horizon, its rate of growth will match that of
the second half of the 1990s (roughly 13/C254%).
As expected, private consumption declined
perceptibly in real terms at the beginning of
2007. This was due not only to the direct
dampening effect of the increase in the
standard rate of VAT but also to anticipatory
spending in 2006, which was “lacking”
thereafter. This was also reflected in house-
hold saving. Saving’s share of disposable in-
come fell initially to 10.4% in the final quar-
ter of 2006 before going back up to 10.9%
in the first six months of 2007.
Once the time shifts in saving caused by the
VAT increase have run their course, the fun-
damental determinants of saving will increas-
ingly return to the fore. Among the major
factors contributing to the increase in the
household saving ratio since 2000, provision-
al saving, ie the necessity of making private
pension provision, is still a factor. By contrast,
precautionary saving is becoming less import-
ant in view of the improved labour marketKey results of the macroeconomic

Households’ income situation will likewise

employment, higher average compensation
of employees and the ongoing rise in profit
and investment income will contribute to this
in equal measure. Overall, households’ nom-
inal disposable income is likely to increase to
just under 31/C252% in 2008 and 3% in 2009. To-
gether with the somewhat reduced propen-
sity to save, this will lead to a perceptible rise
in real private consumption of around 11/C252%
in each of the two years.
There was a further improvement in the la-
bour market situation in 2007 in the wake of
the sharp upswing, and clear progress has
been made in reducing long-term unemploy-
ment. The wage moderation of the past few
years and the integration of persons with
below-average productivity into the produc-
tion process have caused economic growth to
become more labour-intensive. This trend is
likely to continue during the forecasting hori-
zon. Accordingly, the increase in hourly prod-
uctivity, at just under 1% in 2008 and 11/C252%i n
2009, will remain below the average rate of
the past ten years (+13/C254%). Given the eco-
nomic growth projected here, the total num-
ber of hours worked will go up by 1% and
just under1/C252% respectively.
In calendar-adjusted terms, the average num-
ber of hours worked per employed person isunlikely to change much during the forecast-
ing horizon. The increasing part-time ratio
could be more or less offset by the cyclically
induced additional hours worked by full-time
employees used to counter partial shortages
in the labour market. The number of persons
in work is likely to increase by around1/C252%i n
both 2008 and 2009. For the forecasting
horizon, it is assumed that the decline in the
number of persons of working age for demo-
graphic reasons will be roughly offset by in-
creased labour market participation. Under
these conditions, the official unemployment
figure of not quite 3.7 million in autumn
2007 will fall by more than 400,000 by the
end of 2009. On an annual average, this
means an official unemployment level of
3.5 million in 2008 and 3.3 million in 2009.
Accordingly, the unemployment rate as de-
fined by the Federal Employment Agency will
fall from 9.0% in 2007 to 8.3% in 2008 and
7.8% in 2009.
Labour costs and price outlook
Following a lengthy period of pronounced
wage moderation, negotiated rates of pay
may be expected to rise again somewhat.
This is already suggested by wage agree-
ments in 2007. Negotiations scheduled for
2008 include those for the public sector (cen-
tral and local government). As basic pay rates
have virtually stood still for a period of three
years, a perceptible increase may be expected
in line with the pattern in the private sector.

24Including the increases already agreed in
2007 and the other new agreements, it is as-
sumed that the overall negotiated rates of
pay will increase by 21/C252% in both 2008 and
2009.
Given that the outlook for the economy re-
mains positive and that isolated shortages
exist in some segments of the labour market,
actual earnings, too, are likely to increase at a
more rapid pace. The growth of gross remu-
neration per employed person, at more than
21/C252% in 2008 and 23/C254% in 2009, could
therefore outpace that of negotiated rates of
pay somewhat. We accordingly expect a
slightly positive wage drift during the fore-
casting horizon.Along with the expected increase in product-
ivity, this will lead to a growth in nominal unit
labour costs, ie the ratio of compensation per
employee to real GDP per person employed,
of just under 1% in 2008 and roughly 11/C252%
in 2009. This will mean a gradual rise in wage
cost pressure despite the fact that a marked
easing of social security contributions has
been agreed for 2008. At the same time, the
price for domestic value added – measured
by the GDP deflator at basic prices – will go
up by 11/C252% in both 2008 and 2009. In sum,
enterprises will probably only be able to
achieve a slight increase in their profit mar-
gins.
Consumer price inflation in 2007 was influ-
enced to a particular extent by government
measures (3% increase both in the standard
rate of VAT and in insurance tax, introduction
of university tuition fees in a number of fed-
eral states, and compulsory admixture of bio-
fuels to petrol and diesel). In purely nominal
terms, these measures added around 11/C252per-
centage points to the expected annual aver-
age HICP rate of 2.3%.5
A similarly sharp rise in consumer prices is an-
ticipated for 2008 on average, although the
fiscal strains will be far less severe. Despite
the dampening effects of appreciation, infla-
tionary pressure will be exerted mainly by
higher crude oil prices, which are also reflect-
ed in the prices of other energy sources and –
like the prices of other commodities – add to2005 = 100, seasonally adjusted,

25firms’ costs. Added to this is the upward
pressure on prices emanating from the inter-
national agricultural markets.6According to
the assumptions on which the projection is
based, these unfavourable effects will either
diminish or even go into reverse in 2009. At
1.5% for 2009, therefore, a distinctly lower
rate of price increase is expected than in the
two preceding years. The absence of a more
marked difference between 2007-08 and
2009 is mainly because the stronger wage
cost pressure is being gradually reflected in
consumer prices. The HICP inflation rate dur-
ing the forecasting horizon may be expected
to remain above 21/C252% well into 2008 before
going down to 21/C254% in the third quarter of
that year. Under the given assumptions and
provided there are no further price shocks,
HICP rates of 11/C252% can be anticipated for the
rest of the forecasting horizon.
Public finances
The public finance situation in Germany con-
tinued to improve perceptibly in 2007.7Fol-
lowing a deficit of 1.6% of nominal GDP in
2006, a more less or less balanced general
government budget is likely to be achieved in
2007. Although the favourable development
of the economy played a part in this decrease,
much of it is due to structural factors such as,
in particular, the increase in VAT and the con-
tinued moderate development of expend-
iture.
The general government budget situation is
likely to worsen again in 2008. However, the
renewed positive cyclical influence, as seenfrom the current perspective, will partially off-
set the foreseeable structural deterioration.
Besides a lowering of the contribution rate to
the Federal Employment Agency, the devel-
opment in profit-related taxes will contribute
to what will probably be a slight overall
budget deficit. First, the marked tax shortfalls
in connection with the business tax reform
have to be taken into account in this context.
Second, following the sharp growth rates of
the past few years, revenue from profit-
related taxes is now likely to have reached a
level that is perceptibly higher than normal.
With this in mind and given the persistent fi-
nancial market turbulence, rather weak
growth appears probable for the immediate
future. Overall, the general government rev-
enue ratio is therefore likely to show a
marked fall. Nevertheless, the expenditure
ratio will also decline – albeit to a lesser ex-
tent – since pension and labour market ex-
penditure, in particular, is continuing to grow
at a lower rate than nominal GDP .
Assuming that no further fiscal measures are
taken and that the overall economic setting
for public finances remains favourable, gen-
eral government budget balances are likely to
improve again in 2009. The expenditure ratio
could continue to fall, albeit more slowly,
while the revenue ratio will probably show
hardly any change from how things stand at

if the avera ge deviation is low, this in dicates that the 
fore casts are comparatively se cure.

and these can be frau ght with errors (exo genous un cer-

stood at 67.5% at the end of 2006, is likely
to fall to just over 60% by 2009.
Risk assessment
Even though the baseline scenario presented
here is to be regarded as the most likely de-
velopment given the assumptions made, it is,
naturally enough, fraught with risks and un-
certainties which might lead to actual devel-
opments deviating from expected devel-
opments (see the explanatory notes on
page 26-27). The impact of such factors on
the macroeconomic projection of GDP and
prices is studied as part of the Bundesbank’s
macroeconomic risk analysis. In this context,
a distinction has to be made between ex-
ogenous risk factors (especially developments
in the world economy and interest rates) and
endogenous (domestic) risk factors. Devi-
ations from the usual degree of forecast un-
certainty are of particular interest.
The upswing in Germany in 2007 became
stronger insofar as the endogenous expan-
sionary forces gained in importance and key
underlying conditions for growth improved.
From summer onwards, however, risks to
both the real economy and price stability in-
creased. Depending on the given circum-
stances, there could be significant downward
departures from the baseline scenario for the
real economy if the various risks were to ma-
terialise. The extent of the cyclical slowdown
would hinge on the confluence of risk factors
and on how strongly they would affect ex-pectations. Specifically, it is possible to iden-
tify the risks outlined below.
In view of the continuing problems that have
stemmed from the US subprime mortgage
market, a marked slowdown in the US econ-
omy cannot be ruled out. Dampening effects
would then spread not only through the for-
eign trade channel but also via the financial
and foreign exchange markets. Nevertheless,
as things stand at present, the global risk
from a sharp slump in overall economic activ-
ity in the United States is considered to be
comparatively slight.
The international oil markets still harbour a
substantial potential for economic disruption.
This is all the more the case as very high oil
spot prices have now been reached in real
terms, too, ie taking into account consumer
price movements in the industrial countries.
Given the expected continuation of dynamic
global growth, especially in regions with a
sharply rising demand for energy, further oil
price surges – owing, say, to heightened geo-
political tensions or unfavourable weather
conditions – cannot be ruled out. Although
this would lead to an increase in demand for
imported industrial goods in the oil-exporting
countries, a fairly stronger dampening of do-
mestic demand in the oil-consuming coun-
tries would occur, particularly in the short
term. If the cooling of the US economy were
more marked than expected, leading to a
slower pace of growth in the other industrial
countries, oil prices would also come under
pressure.Macroeconom-

29At the end of the period under review, the
euro’s exchange rate was at new record highsagainst the US dollar. This development couldcontinue; on the one hand, this would harmGerman enterprises’ competitive position inthe international sales markets and encour-age import substitution. On the other hand,an appreciation of the euro in the foreign ex-change markets would have a dampening im-pact on domestic prices and tend to strength-en domestic purchasing power. The otherside of the story regarding the downside riskto the economy is that the euro area accountsfor more than two-fifths of Germany’s inter-national trade – a share which is thereforenot directly influenced by the exchange rate.Moreover, the majority of trade with theother EU member countries is unlikely to beaffected directly by the change in euro-USdollar parity.
The turbulence in the international money
and capital markets and their possible impli-cations now have to be newly incorporatedinto the risk scenario. Despite the current ad-verse conditions, the German banking and fi-nancial system has fully retained its functionalviability and stability.
8However, at least in the
short term, the necessary repricing of riskpositions for certain financial products willpose a certain strain, even though a moremoderate pace will be quite conducive to thesustainability of the global growth processfrom an allocational point of view. It may be
that the real economic consequences will beall the greater, the longer the lack of trans-parency continues and the functioning of cer-tain market segments is disrupted.
The described profile of the price projections
for 2008 and 2009 will be shaped crucially bythe underlying oil price assumption. If theprice of oil does not, as expected, come backdown in the foreseeable future, but goes upinstead, considerably less favourable rates ofprice increase may be anticipated. Much thesame applies to the assumption that the re-cent sharp upward price trends in the inter-national agricultural markets will ease offmarkedly throughout the forecasting horizon.This effect might be reinforced by a sharpprice increase having a knock-on effect onwages. On the other hand, the price trendcould also be more favourable if there is amarked downward correction of prices foragricultural products, which is not implausiblegiven the typical high elasticity of supply inthis sector. The price-dampening impact ofthe appreciation of the euro so far might alsobe stronger than expected and the eurocould continue to appreciate. Taking every-thing together, however, the upside risks tofuture price developments predominate atthe end of the forecasting horizon.

31German enterprises’
profitability and
financing in 2006According to the Bundesbank’s corpor-
ate balance sheet statistics, profitabil-
ity and financing in the corporate sec-
tor showed a further significant im-
provement in 2006. Given strong busi-
ness growth and a sustained moderate
development in personnel expenses,
there was again a double-digit rise in
gross profits. The return on sales be-
fore taxes on income has increased by
1 percentage point since 2003 and, at
41/C252%, reached its highest figure in the
past ten years.
In addition to retained profits, the
total inflow of funds from other
sources also increased sharply, accom-
panied by low interest rates. On the fi-
nancing side, favourable conditions
were therefore in place for a rapid bal-
ance sheet growth. Moreover, capacity
extensions were necessary, particularly
in the manufacturing sector. The
budgets for the accumulation of finan-
cial assets were increased again to an
even greater extent. The structure of
the assets thus again shifted in favour
of financial assets. The capital base was
strengthened further. The sound finan-
cial state of German enterprises that
has now been achieved – together
with comfortable profitability – also
offers a good protection against risks
and disruptive external influences,
which have recently become stronger.

32Overall economic environment
The German economy was able to gain clear
momentum in 2006 after overcoming its pro-
tracted sluggish phase in 2004 and already
showing indications in 2005 of a broadening
of the upward cyclical trend. At 3%, real
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006 grew
more sharply on an annual average than at
any time since 2000. Overall output thus also
increased to a markedly greater degree than
potential output, resulting in a perceptible
rise in capacity utilisation and a narrowing of
the (hitherto considerable) output gap.1
From a sectoral perspective, notable contribu-
tions to growth came both from the services
sector (+11/C254percentage points) and the pro-
duction sector (+11/C252percentage points), with
the construction sector contributing to the
overall expansion for the first time since
1994. The real gross value added of the eco-
nomic sectors recorded in the corporate bal-
ance sheet statistics rose by as much as 4% in
2006, compared with 33/C254% in trade and in-
dustry as a whole, which also includes electri-
city, gas and water supply, hotels and restaur-
ants, post and telecommunications, financial
intermediation as well as real estate activities,
and 23/C254% in the economy as a whole.2The
large difference in growth between the value
added of the business sector and the overall
aggregate is also linked to the slower pace of
growth in public and private services (+11/C254%).
In 2006, the upswing spread to domestic de-
mand on a broad front, after first moving
from exports to investment in machinery and
equipment. The present economic cycle hastherefore followed the traditional pattern so
far. At 121/C252%, real exports of goods and ser-
vices grew more dynamically than in the pre-
vious two years. The main reason for this was
the buoyant growth of the export markets.
Moreover, the German economy was able to
maintain its price competitiveness at a high
level, which was mainly due to the moderate
price and cost developments in Germany and
the relatively stable effective exchange rate of
the euro on an annual average.3The strong
export activity together with the recovering
domestic economy have also drawn imports
upwards, which increased by 111/C254% in real
terms. All in all, foreign trade contributed just
over 1 percentage point to GDP growth in
2006.
In view of flourishing export business and the
positive sentiment in many parts of the econ-
omy, the increase in real expenditure on new
machinery and equipment, at 81/C254%, was
even sharper than in the preceding two years.
In this context, there was a particularly sharp
increase in the share of investment in capacity
extensions, which also boosted industrial con-
struction investment. In addition, following
an adjustment process lasting ten years,
housing construction was on an upward
trend again, even though a part in this was

the economy’s growth potential, Monthly Report, Octo-
ber 2007, pp 35-45.
2The growth rate of real value added being lower than
that of real GDP can be explained in purely mathematical
terms by the fact that real taxes on products, which are
netted with subsidies on products and added to value
added in order to obtain GDP at market prices, rose by
just over 3% in 2006.
3However, in the course of the year, the euro appreci-
ated by 41/C254%, which is significant for the valuation of
assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date (usually at
the end of the year).Strong

33played by special factors, such as the aboli-
tion of the grant to homebuyers at the end of2005 and anticipatory effects owing to theVAT increase on 1 January 2007. Towards theend of 2006, the anticipatory effects werealso clearly reflected in private consumption.Furthermore, the favourable development inthe labour market generated positive stimuliin this regard. The sharp rise in employmentwas a crucial factor in households’ availableincome increasing from 1
1/C252% in 2005 to
21/C254% in the year under review. At 1% on an
annual average in price-adjusted terms, pri-vate consumption experienced its strongestincrease since 2001.
The more balanced demand profile in 2006
was reflected in the business activity of enter-prises in the economic sectors under consid-eration to the extent that the increase in theirdomestic turnover, at approximately 5
1/C252%,
was greater than the average since the mid-1990s (+2%). Even so, owing to the extreme-ly buoyant expansion of exports, their shareof total sales went up to 22
1/C252% (see also the
explanatory notes on pages 34-35). On anaverage of the period from 2001 to 2006, thegrowth rate of export sales was just over5
1/C252%, compared with a rate of 11/C252% in do-
mestic business. During this period, the shareof nominal aggregate exports in GDP in-creased by a total of 11
3/C254percentage points.
Since 1994, it has increased by as much as22 percentage points to 45%. Following theexperiences of the first half of the presentdecade, when the large enterprises benefit-ed, in particular, from the revival of exports, itwould now conversely seem to be the casethat the strong growth in domestic sales es-pecially benefited small and medium-sized
enterprises, which are typically more focusedon the domestic market than large enter-prises.

34Deutsche BundesbankGerman enterprises’ exports by economic sector and size category since the mid-1990s
From their cyclical low in 1993 up to 2007, German exports
of goods and services, as defined in the national accounts,
increased by an annual average of 81/C254% in value and 8% in
volume.1During the same period, the corresponding rise in
imports was 7% and 61/C252% respectively. The dynamic devel-
opment in exports was instrumental in boosting imports in
that there has been an increase in the import content of
exports since the mid-1990s, going up from around 30% to
45% at the end of the period under review. The ratio of ex-
port-induced value added to total exports showed a corres-
ponding fall. In relation to gross domestic product (GDP),
however, dynamic export growth – accompanied by a
mostly subdued growth in domestic demand – caused ex-
port-induced value added to go up from 133/C254% in 1995 to
just over 21% in 2006. Between 1995 and 2007, the German
economy’s degree of openness, defined as the ratio of im-
ports and exports to GDP, increased by 391/C252percentage
points to 87%.
Below, the main focus will be on investigating the extent
to which small, medium-sized and large enterprises in the
individual economic sectors have contributed to the Ger-
man economy’s export success. This study is based on data
from the official turnover tax statistics on taxable sales
with input tax deduction, which have been published an-
nually only since 1997 (previously biennially); currently
data are available up to 2005.2Data by size category based
on the turnover tax statistics are likewise available from
1997 onwards. Using this database, it is possible, first, to
identify how the export sale of enterprises in the various
size categories has expanded. Second, it is possible to
determine the percentage of enterprises which actually
conduct business with foreign customers as well as the
ratio of exports to total sales.
The nominal export data based on the turnover tax statis-
tics are to a very large extent consistent with those of the
national accounts.3Both time series display a virtually iden-
tical path for the period between 1994 and 2002. In the
subsequent years, however, exports as defined in the na-
tional accounts showed stronger growth at times. During
the period from 1994 to 2002, the level of export sales was
3% to 4% below the national accounts figures in each
year. Since then, the gap has widened further, increasing
to 9% in 2004 and 8% in 2005. This difference is partly due
to the fact that exports as defined in the national accounts
also contains domestic private consumption by non-residents, such as tourists, whereas this is not included in
the tax-free sales of the turnover tax statistics. Further-
more, there are additional conceptual differences between
these two sets of statistics.4The notable widening of the
gap in 2004 and 2005 might be mainly attributable to the
fact that, following EU enlargement on 1 May 2004, there
was a distinct increase in cross-border commission proces-
sing business with the new member states. This led to a
corresponding increase in the exports recorded in the for-
eign trade statistics and, therefore, also in the national ac-
counts. Such activities hardly affect exports in the turnover
tax statistics as such processing business does not normally
involve any sales transactions.
The economic sectors covered by the Deutsche Bundes-
bank’s corporate balance sheet statistics (production sector,
trade, transport and business-related services), which in
2005 accounted for around 82% of turnover in the econ-
omy as a whole, were responsible for 94% of the exports
recorded in the turnover tax statistics, with just over two-
thirds of German export sales coming from the manufac-
turing sector alone. Within industry, motor vehicle manu-
facture was again the dominant export sector, supplying
one-fifth of total exports in 2005.
The percentage of enterprises with export business rose by
2 percentage points between 1994 and 2005 to 151/C252%. The
export ratio went up by 8 percentage points to 211/C254%. In
2005, the exports of all enterprises, ie including those not
recorded in the corporate balance sheet statistics, as meas-
ured by total sales, stood at 181/C252% and were thus well be-
low the export ratio relating to GDP. This was due mainly
to the fact that total sales, as a reference variable, include
sales from earlier stages of production and are therefore
well above the level of GDP. With regard to the national
accounts, the ratio of exports to gross output is concep-
tually easier to compare. This amounted to 161/C252% in 2005.
By size category, the percentage of medium-sized enter-
prises (turnover of 51 million up to 550 million) engaging
in export business has risen very sharply since 1997, ie by
51/C252percentage points to 481/C252%.5There was also an above-
average increase in the ratio for large enterprises of
31/C252percentage points to 871/C252%. By contrast, at the end of
the period under review only 101/C252% of small enterprises
were conducting business with foreign customers, com-
pared with 91/C252% in 1997. However, it should be noted as a
1The data for the fourth quarter of 2007 (unavailable at present)
were estimated. — 2Tax-free goods and services are usually excluded
from input tax deduction. However, this does not apply to exported
goods and services and in some other cases, such as turnover from
marine transport and aviation, and deliveries of gold to central
banks. These items are shown as an aggregate in the turnover tax sta-
tistics, which means that export sales cannot be separated. However,the latter represent by far the most important form of goods and ser-
vices with input tax deduction. — 3By contrast, the import ratios of
German enterprises cannot be determined on the basis of the turn-
over tax statistics. The reason is that import turnover tax on imports
from non-EU countries is levied by the customs authorities. Only im-
ports from EU member states are covered by the turnover tax
statistics. — 4See Deutsche Bundesbank, The export business of Ger-

35general point in this connection that many enterprises
which have achieved no or only few export sales in thepast few years have also participated indirectly in this dy-namic growth in external demand through the increasedsupply of intermediate goods to exporters.
Between 1998 and 2005, the greatest increases in export
sales were enjoyed by large enterprises at just under 7%annually, followed by medium-sized enterprises at 4
1/C252%.
By contrast, small enterprises achieved an increase of just2
1/C252%. The growth lead of the large enterprises applied to
all sectors of the economy apart from the construction in-dustry. Against a backdrop of a mostly subdued expansionof domestic demand in Germany, the rapid export growthof the large enterprises with export business during theperiod from 1998 to 2005 led to exports as a share of theirtotal sales going up by 5 percentage points to 27
1/C252%. The
increase in the percentage of exports in the case ofmedium-sized enterprises was smaller than for the largeenterprises at 3
1/C252percentage points to just under 14%. For
small enterprises, exports, at less than 3%, were still moreof an additional business.
The large enterprises have therefore been the mainstay of
the German export boom in recent years. Their share of to-tal exports by the economic sectors under review has growneven further since 1997, ie by 3 percentage points to 79
1/C252%.
This development has been at the expense of the medium-sized segment whose “market share” has fallen from 22
1/C252%
to 191/C252%. At the same time, the placing of small enterprises
has declined by1/C252percentage point to 1%.10

36tinued in 2006. Negotiated rates of pay went
up by 11/C254% on a monthly basis and by 1% on
an hourly basis. However, there are quite
marked differences between the individual
economic sectors. For example, negotiated
rates of pay in manufacturing went up by
23/C254%, which was due, among other things,
to the sharp wage rises in the steel industry
(+31/C254%). By contrast, the negotiated wage
increases in construction, in trade and in the
public sector remained below 1%. Actual
earnings per employee increased by 1% in
the economy as a whole, compared with1/C254%
in 2005. This was accompanied by a sharp
rise in labour productivity of 21/C254% per person
employed and 21/C252% per hour worked by
each person employed, which meant that
unit labour costs declined again, namely by
1%.
The sharper 171/C252% fall in corporate insolven-
cies is also consistent with the more benign
economic picture presented last year, follow-
ing a decline of1/C254% in 2004 and of 6% in
2005.5The insolvency ratio, ie the number of
insolvencies per 10,000 firms, declined from
121 in 2005 to 100; the previous peak of 135
had been in 2003. This average number for
enterprises as a whole includes significant
variations among the individual economic
sectors. Thus, the number ranged from 15 in
electricity, gas and water supply to 178 in
construction, where firms are traditionally
very prone to insolvency. In 2006, the liabil-
ities of insolvent enterprises fell by 15%, ie
almost in step with the number of affected
enterprises, to 3191/C252billion. As had been the
case in previous years, it was mostly small
and fairly new firms that were affected byinsolvency in 2006, of which many were
probably one-person businesses. Accordingly,
the average number of employees of insolv-
ent enterprises was relatively low at four per-
sons.

nomic growth in 2006, the profits published
in the corporate balance sheet statistics ex-
panded considerably.6
The annual result before taxes on income7of
firms in the production sector, in trade, in

one-half (+471/C252%). The growth in profit pub-

6The following study is based on 23,000 financial state-
ments for 2006. The statistical base therefore corres-
ponds to about one-third of the annual number of finan-
cial statements in the two preceding years. The results for
2006 were estimated on the basis of the extrapolation re-
sults of 2005, which were determined on the basis of
data from the turnover tax statistics. This article shows
the profitability and financing of enterprises in the eco-
nomic sectors under study as a whole for the period
2004 to 2006. The appendix tables contain more detailed
information for individual economic sectors for 2004 and
2005. Data from earlier years may be found in Special
Statistical Publication 5, Extrapolated results from finan-
cial statements of German enterprises 1994 to 2003,
which is available as a regularly updated Excel file for
download from the internet (http://www.bundesbank.de/

as are all other publications of the corporate balance
sheet statistics.
7The annual result corresponds to the annual profit in
accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)
before profit or loss transfers. It provides a better indica-
tion of the profits generated by the enterprises analysed
in this article, because many firms are linked through
profit transfer agreements with enterprises which are not
included in the corporate balance sheet statistics (eg
holding companies) and to which their profits/losses are
transferred.Further decline

37lished for 2006 is also in line with the data of
the national accounts on the earnings of non-financial corporations
8, whose profits were
11% up on the previous year’s level. The in-crease since 2003 was 46
3/C254% and thus virtu-
ally matched the rise shown in the corporatebalance sheet statistics. Such co-movement isby no means always the case. Particularly inyears of economic downturn or in periods ofstrong depreciation of a country’s own cur-rency, valuation losses generally depress theresult before taxes on income more than theprofits in the national accounts, since these,by design, include neither extraordinary earn-ings nor valuation gains and losses. Converse-ly, increases in value, which occur especially inperiods of recovery, generate profit only in ex-ceptional cases owing to the principle of thelower of cost or market that has hitherto ap-plied to the accounting.
The gross return on sales, which shows the
ratio of the annual result before taxes on in-come to sales, increased in 2006 by
1/C254per-
centage point on the year – and since 2003by 1 percentage point – to 4
1/C252%. It thus also
went up to its highest level since the start ofthe series based on the Financial StatementsData Pool in 1997. Moreover, the relevant fig-ures on the gross return on sales in westernGermany, which are available for the periodfrom 1987 to 1998, were clearly exceeded;3
1/C252% was achieved in the good profit years
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This wasfollowed by a decline to 1

38have since occurred at German enterprises
are revealed very clearly by the fact that the
return on sales during the marked economic
slowdown in the first half of the current dec-
ade did not fall below 31/C252% and has gone up
sharply from this level in the ongoing up-
swing. Measured by gross income, which is
produced by subtracting the cost of materials
from the gross revenue and which represents
a crude measure of enterprises’ gross value
added, the 2006 gross annual result was
121/C252%, compared with 9% in 2003.9
The continuing improvement in profitability in
2006 could be observed in almost all eco-
nomic sectors recorded in the corporate bal-
ance sheet statistics. At 131/C252%, the gross an-
nual result for manufacturing showed a
slightly higher-than-average increase; the
gross return on sales rose to a new high of
41/C252%. The manufacture of transport equip-
ment and the manufacture of (other) machin-
ery and equipment, whose products were in
high demand in Germany and abroad, also
contributed to this positive result. The manu-
facture of textiles and textile products was
once again on the cyclical downside, suffer-
ing a marked decline in profits. This was due,
not least, to ongoing competitive pressure,
especially from the emerging market econ-
omies of South-East Asia. The chemicals in-
dustry also had to cope with a decline in
profits. In this case, special accounting effects
played a part in addition to the sharp rise in
crude oil prices.
Profitability in the wholesale trade, which,
from a cyclical perspective, is closely inter-
linked with manufacturing, also improvedwith a 17% growth in profits. Sales had a
share of more than 21/C252% in the annual result.
Business-related services also benefited from
this buoyant industrial activity and were able
to increase their gross annual result by 7%
following high double-digit growth rates in
the previous two years. As sales increased at
the same pace, the return measured by it
remained at the high level of 91/C252%. Profitabil-
ity in the transport sector is usually also
strongly influenced by industrial activity. In
2006, however, a sharp increase in fuel costs
was one of the reasons for a decline in profits
in spite of robust growth in business. There
was also a further increase in expenses result-
ing from the motorway tolls for heavy goods
vehicles that were introduced in 2005. How-
ever, measured by sales, the annual result
was still 31/C252%.
The construction industry was able to expand
its gross result by almost one-third in 2006,
following a decline in profits in the previous
year. This was mainly due to the general
improvement in construction activity and
heightened demand in housing construction,
which were given considerable stimulus by
the abolition of the grant to homebuyers and
the anticipatory effects of the VAT increase.
The pick-up in construction activity as well as
the rapid rise in the costs of materials meant
that it was possible to put noticeable price in-
creases into effect (+21/C252%). The gross return
on sales also showed a clear upward trend. In

mediate goods. The expenses for certain services (eg ad-

392006, the anticipatory effects of the VAT in-
crease as of 1 January 2007 also led to a(temporary) revival of business in the saleof motor vehicles. Given a sales growthrate of 6
1/C252%, gross profits rose by almost
one-quarter and the return on sales by1/C252per-
centage point to well over 21/C252%. However,
the heightened demand for new cars waspartly to the detriment of sales in traditionalretail outlets, which increased by only 1% innominal terms and by not quite
1/C252% in real
terms in 2006. Nevertheless, mostly owing tomore favourable cost prices, the enterprisesin this economic sector were able to boosttheir gross annual result by 7
1/C252% and slightly
raise the return on sales before taxes on in-come to 4
1/C252%.
Overall, the returns in the economic sectors
considered here range from 21/C252% in whole-
sale trade to 91/C252% in business-related ser-
vices. This large difference is due in part tothe fact that some sectors – the wholesaletrade, in particular – are characterised by arelatively extensive use of materials or a ra-ther low depth of value added. In this case, acorrespondingly low return on sales is to beexpected. Setting the annual result beforetaxes on income in relation to gross income,the range of the relevant industry ratios de-clines only slightly at first. However, if trans-port (+7%) is excluded as an “outlier”, theratios were quite close together, ie between11
1/C252% (construction) and 151/C252% (wholesale
trade). At 121/C252%, manufacturing is ranked in
the bottom half of this group.Enterprises’ income statement*

40Income and expenses in detail
The favourable profit developments in 2006
are based in large part on the strong growth
in business activity. The economic sectors re-
corded in the corporate balance sheet statis-
tics increased their gross revenue – which, in
addition to sales, includes changes in stocks
of finished goods as well as other own work
capitalised – by well over 61/C252%, following
3% in 2004 and 41/C252% in 2005. The largest
contribution to growth (+31/C252percentage
points) came from manufacturing, which ex-
panded its business activity by more than
8%, compared with just under 5% in 2005.
The rates of change in gross revenue in the
other sectors of the economy were close to
the average in most cases, with the exception
of the retail trade sector (excluding motor ve-
hicles), which was able to record only a small
increase in business.
Interest income grew even more sharply than
gross revenue, namely by 17%. The main rea-
son for this was that the annual average level
of interest-bearing financial assets was
stepped up by 71/C252%. Another contributory
factor was the higher rate of interest. How-
ever, this was accompanied by only a modest
increase of 2% for other income, which is
composed of a large number of very different
items. Both items combined increased by
31/C252%. Owing to their minor weight, however,
these types of income together expanded vir-
tually to the same degree as gross revenue.
Overall costs (excluding taxes on income of
corporations) increased by almost 61/C252%i n
2006, which was1/C252percentage point lessthan total income. This created room for im-
proving the gross annual result. Among the
individual cost items, the use of material and
interest expenses increased by more than the
average; all other cost categories, particularly
personnel expenses, increased at a slower
pace than the overall value or, like operating
taxes, at the same pace.
The cost of materials went up by 71/C252%i n
2006 and thus more than the gross revenue.
This was due to a further sharp rise in import
prices for raw materials and semi-finished
goods (+211/C252%). The main reason for this
was the sustained high level of prices in the
international commodity markets. For ex-
ample, German import prices for oil and gas
as well as for metal ores all increased by near-
ly one-quarter. This especially affected enter-
prises in the transport sector, manufacturing
and the importing wholesale trade. The con-
struction industry also had to cope with
marked price increases for intermediate
goods, in particular for steel and for construc-
tion chemicals. By contrast, the retail trade
benefited from the fact that the prices for im-
ported finished goods declined again, namely
by 1%. The cost of materials in traditional re-
tail trade was only just over1/C252% up on the
year, not least owing to consumers’ reluc-
tance to purchase.
The modest rise in personnel expenses (+3%)
formed a strong counterweight to the sharp
increase of the cost of materials. Its share
of total expenses showed a further fall to
161/C252% in 2006, compared with 191/C252%i n
1997. The main reason for this was the
above-mentioned sustained moderate devel-Gross revenue

41opment in wages. Employment in the sectors
under consideration also increased againslightly (+
1/C252%) on an annual average, follow-
ing a decline in the number of employed per-sons by a total of 5% in the four previousyears. However, the sectoral picture is distort-ed by the sharp rise in the hiring out of la-bour, to the extent that personnel expensesare entered for the temporary employmentagencies, which belong to business-relatedservices, although a significant amount of thework is performed in industrial enterprises.
10
This puts into perspective the finding, basedon the official statistics, that there was a fur-ther (1%) fall in the number of employees inmanufacturing in 2006, in contrast to an in-crease of 4
1/C252% in business-related services.
Enterprises that use the services of temporaryemployment agencies record the remuner-ation to these agencies in the summary itemfor other costs, which increased by 5
1/C252%i n
2006.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets (includ-
ing intangible fixed assets) increased by 4%in 2006. This signifies a marked turnaroundin light of the fact that the cost item declinedsignificantly in the four previous years owingto the weaker investment activity at thattime. The noticeable rise in the reporting yearis due not only to recently more buoyant in-vestment activity, but also to the temporaryraising of the declining-balance depreciationrates for movables in 2006 and 2007. This isconsistent with the relatively sharp increase(+7%) in manufacturing, which accounts fora large part of investment in machinery andequipment. Moreover, it should be taken intoaccount that the leasing of machinery andtransport equipment is increasingly taking the
place of acquisition in some sectors, especial-ly in construction. The relevant depreciation isrecorded for the hirers that are assigned tothe economic sector “Renting of machineryand equipment without operator and of per-sonal and household goods” (which is not re-corded in the extrapolation results of the cor-porate balance sheet statistics). Depreciationof financial assets and of short-term securitiesincreased to an even greater extent than de-preciation of tangible fixed assets. Holdingsof assets denominated in US dollar may havebeen affected by this, since the US currencydepreciated significantly against the euro inthe course of the year. Overall, depreciationincreased by 5% in 2006.
Enterprises’ interest expenditure rose by 7%
in 2006, following an overall decline of al-most one-quarter in the previous four years.One reason for this was that the annual aver-age level of short and long-term liabilities in-creased again by 2%, following a prolongedperiod of decline. Another reason is that theaverage lending rate – in line with the marketinterest rates – was on a further upwardtrend to 4
1/C252%. Interest income showed a
stronger percentage increase but, since theincrease in the actual amount was almost thesame, net interest expenditure remained un-changed. Measured by overall expenditure, itwas merely
1/C252%.

are employed in the construction industry. Hiring out of

42Sources and uses of funds
The total inflow of funds to enterprises in the
sectors of the economy under consideration
increased sharply again in 2006, namely by
3611/C252billion – or 34% – to 3240 billion.11
Since the most recent low in 2004, it had
more than doubled. Internal funding ac-
counted for two-fifths of the strong expan-
sion in the reporting year.
The total inflow of internal funds increased
by 151/C252%t o 3181 billion. This was mainly
the result of larger capital injections from
profits (and from contributions to the capital
of non-corporations). By its nature, this com-
ponent reacts particularly strongly to trends
in earnings. An impressive demonstration of
this is that its level had increased from 36 bil-
lion in 2001 to 3501/C252billion at the end of the
period under review. Moreover, the transfers
to provisions and – to a lesser degree – the
“earned” amounts of depreciation also in-
creased in 2006. At 62%, the latter once
again accounted for the lion’s share of intern-
al funds in the reporting year.
Revenue from sources of external funding in-
creased by more than one and a half times, in
fact, to 359 billion. In this case, the upward
trend was quite broadly based. The increase
in the capital of corporations, which had
been weak in the previous year, became
much stronger again. This was also related to
the fact that the stock market climate has be-
come more friendly for new issues. The total
increase in capital from both internal and ex-
ternal sources was 3611/C252billion, which was
one-quarter of the total funds raised. Further-more, there was an inflow of 3481/C252billion
from short and long-term liabilities. There
was a clear reversal, particularly for bank
loans, which were expanded by 371/C252billion,
after net redemptions amounting to 393 bil-
lion between 2001 and 2005.
The more buoyant growth in business activ-
ities was also accompanied by a considerable
expansion of short-term trade payables (and
the matching receivables). Although signifi-
cantly more financial resources were procured
through the issuance of bonds in 2006 than
in previous years, this financing instrument
did not, on the whole, play a major role for
the enterprises considered here. In this con-
text, it should be noted, however, that, in the
case of firms that belong to a large corporate
network, bonds are often issued by financing
companies created especially for this purpose
or by the group headquarters and that the
funds are then passed on internally. This is in
line with the strong growth of 3261/C252billion in
liabilities to affiliated companies.
In 2006, almost nine-tenths of the additional
funds raised went to financial investment and
just over one-tenth to fixed asset formation.
The trend towards financial assets, which has
been evident for some time now, thus con-
tinued at a faster pace. Apart from bank bal-
ances, participations and securities, this main-
ly includes loans to customers and affiliated
enterprises. The rise in fixed asset formation
by 7% in 2006 was due very largely to higher
investment in new machinery and equip-

43ment. The accumulation of stocks accounted
for a rather small amount. At 38 billion, the
net acquisition of tangible fixed assets, pro-
duced by deducting write-downs from the
gross figure, was 50% higher than in 2005,
and thus more than offset the decline in
2003-2004.
The financial wealth of enterprises in the eco-
nomic sectors included here rose by 3119 bil-
lion, compared with 3651/C252billion in 2005. Of
this, 3771/C252billion was accounted for by the
increase in claims, a large part of which were
composed of higher trade receivables. The
build-up of loans to affiliated enterprises also
increased sharply. Enterprises provided 322
billion for the purchase of securities, after
sales had predominated in 2005. By contrast,
at3201/C252billion, the acquisition of other long-
term equity investments was one-third lower
than in the previous year.
Balance sheet trends and balance sheet
ratios
Robust economic activity in 2006 and the fur-
ther improvement in profitability significantly
strengthened the growth of the corporate
balance sheets, namely by 21/C252percentage
points to 6%. This was the strongest increase
since the start of the series in 1997. As al-
ready mentioned, this was mainly due to the
very dynamic development of financial assets,
which expanded by no less than 9%, while
fixed assets increased by 2%. At the end of
the period under review, financial assets ac-
counted for 59% of the balance sheet total,
compared with 51% in 1997. Among itsEnterprises’ sources and uses of funds*

44components, holdings of securities showed
by far the strongest increase at 43%; by the
end of 2006, they amounted to almost 31/C252%
of total assets. This item should be regarded
mainly as a financial buffer for future invest-
ment in new tangible fixed assets and for the
acquisition of other long-term equity invest-
ments. This is consistent with the fact that, at
4%, the equity investment portfolio was
topped up rather moderately in 2006. Loans
to affiliated enterprises increased by 111/C252%.
For business reasons, trade receivables were
also stepped up considerably (+101/C252%) as
were, as a mirror image of this, liabilities
(+81/C252%).
On the liability side of the balance sheet,
there was a further strengthening of the cap-
ital base, a development that had been under
way since 2004; in 2006, the growth was
well over 12%, following 8% in the previous
year. The trend showed that many economic
sectors had a part in this. The average equity
ratio rose by 11/C252percentage points to 25%,
compared with 161/C252% in 1997 and 181/C252%i n
2000. This was attributable mainly to the sub-
stantial topping up of the reserves by 141/C252%.
However, the average share of equity con-
ceals a still quite large range in the equity
ratios of the economic sectors under consid-
eration, extending from 11% in construction
to 28% in manufacturing. Thus, liabilities and
provisions diminished further in significance
in the context of the 2006 balance sheet. This
applies especially to liabilities vis-/C224-vis credit
institutions, which, with a rise of 21/C252%, ac-
counted for no more than 14% of liabilities,
compared with 211/C252% in 1997. The com-
bined provisions were expanded by 41/C252%;Enterprises’ balance sheet*

45measured by the balance sheet total, they de-
clined slightly to just under 191/C252%.
The further perceptible improvement in the
enterprises’ financial situation is also con-
firmed by the liquidity ratios. Thus, the total
capital available long-term increased by1/C252
percentage point to 451/C252% of the balance
sheet total. Moreover, at 151/C252%, it exceeded
the fixed assets even more than in the previ-
ous year. In the short-term range, cash re-
sources and receivables reached a new high
at 96% of liabilities. The cash flow as a per-
centage of liabilities and provisions, which
provides information on the ability to service
debt, rose by 1 percentage point to 18%. Be-
tween 2001 and 2004, which were econom-
ically difficult years for German enterprises,
this ratio had been just under 151/C252%.
Summary
In 2006, the enterprises of the production
sector, trade, transport and the business-
related services sector, maintained the posi-
tive earnings situation, which had been initi-
ated earlier, at a rapid pace. Measured by the
return on sales, the profitability of enterprises
reached its highest level in the past ten years.
Almost all the economic sectors considered
here had a part in this upward trend. The fact
that domestic demand gained greater mo-
mentum along with sustained favourable ex-
port activity also played a part in this. How-
ever, the anticipatory effects owing to the
VAT increase as of 1 January 2007, the main
beneficiaries of which were manufacturers of

46hicles and housing construction, contributed
to a certain overstatement of the cyclical
trends. Housing construction also benefited
from the surge in demand in connection with
the abolition of the grant to homebuyers at
the end of 2005.
Higher retained profits were used together
with the increases from other funding sources
for stepping up gross fixed capital formation
and, to an even greater extent, for the accu-
mulation of financial assets. In this context,
the enterprises – through an increase in se-
curities acquisitions, for example – acquiredfinancial buffers for a future expansion of in-
vestment in new tangible fixed assets and
other long-term equity investments and so
on. At the same time, the capital base
showed a further clear improvement. Other
balance sheet ratios also indicate a notably
greater financial viability. This means, first,
that the requirements for sustainable corpor-
ate growth were strengthened. Second, en-
terprises built up their resilience to disruptive
external influences. Against the background
of the tensions in the financial markets since
the third quarter of 2007, these successes are
to be rated exceptionally highly.

assessment of capital
adequacy under the
Supervisory Review
ProcessRecent financial market events once
again illustrate how essential it is to
apply modern, quantitative risk meas-
urement and management methods in
banks’ internal control processes. Re-
quirements to this effect have already
been established by the revised “Inter-
national Convergence of Capital Meas-
urements and Capital Standards”
framework, known as “BaselII”. Be-
sides the more risk-sensitive regulatory
minimum capital requirements of
Pillar 1, the rules under Pillar 2 require
banks to have an internal risk and cap-
ital management system, known as the
“Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment
Process” (ICAAP), which is adapted to
an institution’s specific risk profile.
German supervisors have conducted a
study on the status of the implementa-
tion of the ICAAP, which banks have to
have in place by the beginning of
2008. The study found that the banks
in Germany are on the right track to
implement the ICAAP properly; the de-
gree of implementation varies, how-
ever. At this juncture, it is impossible to
judge conclusively how adequately the
financial market turbulence in the
second half of this year has been
mapped to banks’ models. However,
since the evolution process of internal
risk management and thus of the
ICAAP is dynamic, the banks’ task is to
take adequate account of their experi-
ences when developing and adapting
their models.

58Introduction
In their evaluation of the Internal Capital
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), Ger-
man supervisors will start with banks’ real-
world practice, especially in order to monitor
and assess new developments as they occur.
To this end, in early 2007, supervisors con-
ducted a survey on individual banks’ internal
control systems.
The study covered the “internal capital con-
cept”, the “calculation of economic capital”
and “risk management using economic cap-
ital”. Nearly all of the major, internationally
active banks as well as several smaller and
medium-sized institutions took part on a
voluntary basis.1All of the statements in this
article refer only to the institutions surveyed
for this study.
The supervisory framework for the ICAAP , the
methodological foundations of economic
capital models and the results of this survey
will be presented in this article. The details
given will provide an overview of the develop-
mental state of German credit institutions’
methods for safeguarding risk-bearing cap-
acity and draw preliminary supervisory con-
clusions.
Supervisory framework
The requirements of Pillar 2 of the Basel II
revised supervisory framework and their
transposition into European law are codified
at the national level in the German Banking
Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ). Pursuant to sec-tion 25a (1) of the Banking Act, credit institu-
tions are required to establish procedures to
calculate and safeguard their risk-bearing
capacity and to manage their risks. These re-
quirements, which are not specified more
precisely in the Banking Act, are given con-
crete shape in the “Minimum requirements
for risk management” ( Mindestanforderun-
gen an das Risikomanagement, orMaRisk ).2
One key component of the MaRisk is the
ICAAP , which sets standards on banks’ intern-
al systems to ensure that their risk-bearing
capacity is maintained on a sustainable basis.
Alongside the ICAAP , Pillar 2 formulates prin-
ciples for the review and evaluation of these
processes by banking supervisors (Supervisory
Review and Evaluation Process, or SREP). The
ICAAP and the SREP together form the Super-
visory Review Process (SRP).
Risk and capital are two key elements of a
bank’s internal control system which are com-
pared with one another when determining a
bank’s risk-bearing capacity. Risk-bearing cap-
acity means that, on the basis of an overall
risk profile, it must be ensured that all of a
bank’s key risks, including as appropriate the
interaction between individual risks, are con-
tinuously backed by the capital held to cover
potential losses. To this end, it is necessary to
1Measured in terms of the institutions’ balance sheet to-
tals, the survey covered nearly 55% of the total domestic
banking system.

59quantify the risks over a given period of time,
also known as the risk horizon.
The capital which is the subject of a risk-bear-
ing capacity concept and is available to cover
potential losses is called “risk-taking poten-
tial”. Unlike the concept of regulatory capital,
the elements of the risk-taking potential are
not governed by any explicit supervisory pro-
visions.
The economic capital requirement is the
result of the quantification of risk across all
key types of risk. According to the MaRisk,
the following types of risk should generally
be included in the analysis of the overall risk
profile: counterparty risk including country
risk, market risk, and operational risk. Taking
these and all other relevant types of risk into
account, an institution must determine which
risks are key to its specific business profile
and must always calculate an economic cap-
ital requirement for each of them. If an insti-
tution does not include key risks in the eco-
nomic capital requirement calculation, it must
provide a comprehensible explanation for not
doing so. These risks, however, must then be
properly factored into the risk management
and control processes.
There are no supervisory rules governing the
choice of procedure to determine the eco-
nomic capital requirement; however, such a
procedure should properly reflect a bank’s in-
dividual situation. The most advanced banks
use complex mathematical models which are
described in the literature as “economic cap-
ital models”. The chart on page 60 shows therelationship between the MaRisk, the ICAAP
and economic capital models.
Foundations of economic capital models
Banks are increasingly modelling the probabil-
ity distribution of potential losses at an overall
bank level in order to measure their risks. In
this process, each bank individually defines
which amount of losses that will be incurred
with a given probability (confidence level) it
wishes to cover with available capital and for
which generally very high but improbable
losses it will run the risk of itself becoming
insolvent.
Standard measures of risk and therefore of
the economic capital requirement are value at
risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). VaR is a
quantile of the loss distribution and thus
denotes the loss amount that will not be
exceeded with a given probability. ES is the
expected value of all losses greater than this
quantile. To calculate the economic capital re-
quirement, the expected value of the loss dis-
tribution is deducted from both measures
since, as “average costs” of banking oper-
ations, it does not represent a risk in the
sense of an uncertainty and should be
covered by margin income. The chart on
page 61 illustrates the relationship between
the aforementioned concepts. The quantile
used to determine VaR is generally derived
from the bank’s target external rating or from
the supervisory provisions for Pillar 1 min-
imum capital ratios (99.9% for credit risk and
operational risk and 99% for market risk).Risk-taking

60The models to determine the economic cap-
ital requirement are typically calibrated on the
basis of historical data and experience. This
can lead to situations in which the model is
unable to accurately map individual risks
owing to an unprecedented market disrup-
tion. Users of these models need to be aware
of these limitations. One possible way to
quantify such model risk is by performing
stress tests. In addition, a sound risk manage-
ment approach should also be based on add-
itional information and analyses.
Internal definitions of risk-taking
potential
There are wide disparities in how risk-taking
potential is defined in banking practice, withbanks regarding very different capital com-
ponents as risk-absorbing in the case of
severe losses. Some banks use adjusted com-
mon equity (ACE) as risk-taking potential.
This comprises balance sheet capital minus
unrealised gains from securities and potential
dividend payments, and is defined much
more narrowly than regulatory capital. Banks
that use the ACE methodology are often ac-
tive capital market participants, for which the
external rating is important. For that reason,
they attach particular importance to consist-
ency between their internal risk management
framework and the requirements imposed by
rating agencies.
Other banks take into account capital com-
ponents which go beyond the definition of
regulatory capital. For instance, some banksDeutsche BundesbankRelationship between the minimum requirements for

of sustainable projected profits across theconsidered risk horizon as risk-covering. Thereason given for this approach is that lossesthat occur are initially cushioned by projectedprofits. The fact that projected profits are pre-liminary estimates and do not yet representactually available capital is regarded by thebanks as tolerable for internal control pur-poses. Whether or not this approach is appro-priate is initially unclear, since, for instance, asevere loss could occur at the beginning ofthe planning period, whereas profits accumu-late only gradually across the period.
Around half of the banks surveyed define sev-
eral stages of risk-taking potential in whichthe balance sheet items serving as risk buffersare arranged in order of their ability to absorblosses and the capital available in the individ-
ual stages of the risk cover fund is comparedwith differing loss levels of the economiccapital requirement. The economic capitalrequirement can thus be calculated not justfor a liquidation situation but also from agoing concern perspective.
From the going concern perspective, the
bank is assumed to continue to operate; theeconomic capital requirement is calculated ata much lower confidence level and the pro-jected profit forms a key component of therisk cover fund. For instance, a comparison ofprojected profits with the VaR at an 80%confidence level concludes that the bank,with its current risk profile, will lose all of itsprojected profits on average every five years.Whereas, in this case, the interests of the

Risks covered in the ICAAP
All respondent institutions listed credit risk,
market risk including interest rate risk in the
banking book and operational risk as key
types of risk.
Further risks which only some banks regard
as key risks are business risk (eg the risk that
income will fall sharply because certain prod-
ucts are no longer in demand), equity risk,
real estate risk and insurance risk. In some
cases, there is a dearth of suitable methods of
quantifying these types of risk, which means
that the relevant capital requirement is deter-
mined only as a pre-determined part of the
risk-taking potential. In the case of smaller
banks, in particular, it is observed that the
types of risk classified as key risks often com-
prise only credit risk, market risk and oper-
ational risk, and that supervisory risk meas-
urement methods are also deployed internally
to measure these risks. The chart on page 63
shows the most important types of risk and
their share in the banks’ overall risk profile.
One type of risk classified as material by sev-
eral of the banks surveyed is market liquidity
risk.3However, no economic capital is held to
cover this risk since a shortage of market
liquidity cannot be offset by increased capital.
Instead, market liquidity risks are monitored
by means of a process that is independent of
economic capital management.Moreover, some banks explicitly model
refinancing liquidity risk – ie the risk that, for
instance, a rating downgrade will leave them
with only more expensive refinancing options
to choose from – and cover this risk with
economic capital.
For most banks, credit risk represents by far
the largest driver of overall risk. To measure
credit risk, larger banks predominantly use
credit risk models, which incorporate not only
the credit ratings of the individual borrowers
but also interdependence between borrow-
ers, measured by correlations.4In order to
calculate their capital requirement, nearly all
of these institutions consider their VaR at the
confidence level, which can be derived from
the external rating targeted by the bank; only
one institution uses ES as a measure. One im-
portant reason for implementing credit risk
models is that the credit portfolios contain
risk concentrations with regard to individual
borrowers, sectors or regions which are not
reflected in the Pillar 1 supervisory measure-
ment approaches. Credit risk models implicit-
ly allocate more capital to loans in concen-
trated segments via the correlations used in
the model; an institution that does not have a
model must manage its risk concentrations
through other risk management devices, such
as limits on lending to certain sectors.
3Normally, the large institutions make a distinction in
liquidity risk between market liquidity risk and refinancing
risk.
4Most institutions’ models have been developed by
third-party providers; most proprietary solutions are simi-
larly based on these external providers’ methods. Proto-
typical third-party solutions include “PortfolioManager”
by Moody’s KMV , “CreditMetrics” by JP Morgan and
“CreditRisk+” by Credit Suisse; some other less common-
ly used models also exist. For a detailed description of the
models, see Bluhm, Overbeck and Wagner, An Introduc-

63Those banks that do not use a credit risk
model calculate the capital requirement forcredit risk according to the supervisory provi-sions for minimum capital requirements pur-suant to the German Solvency Regulation(Solvabilit/C228tsverordnung ). The larger of these
banks use the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB)Approach; however, the input parameterssometimes differ from the standards set bysupervisors. In many cases, there are plans tointroduce a credit risk model in the foresee-able future. Some smaller banks also internal-ly use the less risk-sensitive risk weights ofthe Standardised Approach.
Equity risk is, in some cases, factored into
market risk by institutions. Where this is notpossible, equity risk is modelled separately.To this end, the capital requirement is oftencalculated on the basis of the market values
of equity holdings and their volatilities and acapital factor is determined. An alternativeapproach is to capture equity risk in a mannersimilar to credit risk, but to adjust the defin-ition of default and the imputed loss givendefault (LGD).
Nearly all large, internationally active banks
use their own models to calculate the eco-nomic capital requirement for market risk in-cluding interest rate risk in the banking book.
One of the banks surveyed calculates the eco-
nomic capital for market risk on the basis of asimulation of stress scenarios over a one-yearhorizon. All of the other banks in the surveycalculate market risk as VaR largely over aone-day or ten-day period and a confidence

64level of mostly 95% or 99%. For the pur-
poses of risk aggregation, most institutions
then scale this value up to a one-year horizon
and the appropriate confidence level for an
evaluation of overall risk. This approach is re-
garded by some banks as too conservative as
it implicitly assumes that the portfolio is held
constant for one year and is not actively man-
aged. They therefore scale the market risk
VaR to the time period that they believe is ne-
cessary to liquidate their portfolio. In their
view, the VaR calculated in this manner cor-
responds to the risk over a one-year horizon,
since the portfolio contains no more risk fol-
lowing a hypothetical liquidation. Supervisors
will, in individual cases, analyse the extent to
which this assertion will hold water under
real-life conditions.
In contrast to the many years of experience
which banks have with regard to quantitative
methods of measuring market and credit risk,
the modelling of operational risk is still a rela-
tively new phenomenon. It received a key im-
petus from the regulatory capital require-
ments contained in Basel II, for the calculation
of which banks, under certain circumstances,
are allowed to use their own internal models.
Standards for operational risk models are only
slowly beginning to evolve.
One of the problems that banks face in the
development of their own models is the lack
of available loss data. Unlike, for instance,
market risk, which is determined by the risk
characteristics of the traded financial instru-
ments, operational risk is determined to a
greater extent by institution-specific features,
such as internal processes. In order to maketheir estimates more reliable, institutions are
expanding their database of loss time series
by adding historical third-party data.
Just like in the case of credit risk, several
larger banks and most small banks also use
the simpler approaches for regulatory min-
imum capital requirements pursuant to the
Solvency Regulation (Basic Indicator Ap-
proach or Standardised Approach) for their
internal risk management of operational risk.
However, to what extent the resultant risk
figures, which are not explicitly calibrated to
a given confidence level, are compatible with
the confidence level of the bank’s target rat-
ing for overall bank management purposes
should be explained more clearly by the
banks.
At present, only a few banks take account of
business risk in their economic capital models.
Business risk is typically determined by means
of scenario analyses using expert knowledge
and historical data on revenue and cost fluc-
tuations.
Depending on their business orientation,
banks incorporate further types of risk into
their economic capital model. Such risks may
include real estate risk, collective risk in the
case of building and loan associations or in-
surance risk.
A risk that only a few banks have hitherto
taken into account is model uncertainty. This
uncertainty arises from simplistic model as-
sumptions, erroneous input data and esti-
mates or simplified calculation procedures,
such as when scaling the confidence levelOperational risk Business risk

65and the time horizon. Where such model
risks are taken into account, this is done in-
directly, eg by using conservative estimates.
On the whole, the methods of calculating the
economic capital requirement for business
risk and other types of risk are less advanced
than those used to calculate market risk,
credit risk and operational risk. One reason
may be that the Solvency Regulation does not
impose any regulatory capital charges for
these types of risk. However, it is only within
the past few years that they have come into
the focus of banks’ internal practices.
The interdependence between types of risk is
typically measured through correlations. Ger-
man banks currently use a variety of methods
to calculate the resultant diversification ef-
fects. The approach chosen by most institu-
tions is to add up the economic capital re-
quirement for each of the individual risk
types. From the banks’ perspective, the
underlying assumption of a 100% correlation
represents a conservative assessment of risk.
Where diversification effects are explicitly fac-
tored in – which is currently the case only for
a few large, internationally active banks – the
calculated economic capital requirement is
reduced (by up to 20% compared with the
figure obtained through the simple addition
of types of risk). In doing so, it must be taken
into account that, owing to short or qualita-
tively inadequate data series, the correlations
are often based on expert opinions and the
capital reduction therefore involves a signifi-
cant estimation risk. Diversification effects be-
tween certain types of risk, such as marketrisk or credit risk, are better suited to quanti-
tative modelling than, for instance, correl-
ations between market risk and operational
risk.
Economic capital concepts:
integrating economic capital into overall
bank management
Economic capital concepts describe how eco-
nomic capital is integrated into operational
risk management. The degree of integration
varies from one bank to another. Particularly
among major, internationally active banks,
economic capital concepts are already at a
very advanced stage. The chart on page 66
shows the typical process of integration.
All of the banks surveyed use economic cap-
ital figures for their internal management in-
formation systems: the board of directors, the
risk committee and similar groupings regular-
ly receive information, usually monthly or
quarterly, on current capital adequacy and
the capital requirement. They can thus check
to what extent the measured risk matches
the desired risk profile and is consistent with
the risk strategy. Many banks also factor
these figures into their strategic consider-
ations.
Limit systems based on economic capital at
the overall bank level are another approach
applied widely by the institutions surveyed. In
this approach, the bank’ s senior management
decides what proportion of the risk cover fund
should be placed “in the risk”, ie deployed to
cover the economic capital requirement.Diversification

66Some of the large, internationally active
banks and the vast majority of the smaller
and medium-sized institutions surveyed set
aside a capital buffer equivalent to the regula-
tory minimum capital requirements and then
allocate only that part of the capital that is
left over within the scope of relevant limits.
The vast majority of big banks, however,
derive their institution-wide limit systems
directly from the available risk-taking poten-
tial and the amount of quantified risks with-
out having such an additional capital buffer.
A few larger banks determine the proportion
of the risk cover fund available to cover the
economic capital requirement by drawing
comparisons with other banks (eg by evaluat-
ing annual report figures) and benchmarking
their figures against other banks’ percentageuse of their risk cover fund. However, the ad-
equacy of such benchmarking practices
should be subject to critical scrutiny in specific
cases.
In banks’ risk management, two types of risk
measurement systems exist in parallel: for the
regulatory minimum capital requirements,
the risk assets determined according to super-
visory provisions are compared with regula-
tory capital while, for the ICAAP , banks com-
pare their internally measured risks with their
internally defined risk cover fund. The regula-
tory capital adequacy and regulatory capital
requirements are, in many cases, tough add-
itional conditions for banks’ internal risk man-
agement regimes since the Pillar 1 rules often
lead to a greater capital requirement than
would be necessary from the banks’ internal
point of view. From an internal perspective,
there is therefore often a capital buffer – not
always explicitly envisaged – in the ratio of
the risk cover fund to the internally calculated
economic capital requirement.
Operational risk management stimuli are cre-
ated not only through the use of institution-
wide limits but also largely by allocating the
limits to individual business lines, regions,
types of risk and portfolios: areas that have
not reached their limits can generate new
business.
However, the allocation of the institution-
wide limit to individual portfolios is generally
not additive owing to the diversification
effects both within and between the types of
risk, which presents institutions with prob-
lems. Therefore, with the exception of a fewDeutsche BundesbankTypical process of integrating

67advanced banks that have solved the problem
by means of complex methods, the majority
of banks use simplified capital allocation
mechanisms. In some cases, capital is divided
up in accordance with the correlation be-
tween individual subportfolios and overall risk
(which does not exactly match the economic-
ally accurate risk contributions) or is distrib-
uted according to keys, which are not neces-
sarily correlated with risk indicators, such as
the return on individual portfolios.
Some of the large banks and many smaller
banks are thus currently not able to correctly
distribute their overall limit to lower tiers from
a methodological perspective. With these
banks, it is questionable to what extent eco-
nomic capital provides stimuli for operational
risk management since individual business
lines cannot yet be deliberately grown or
shrunk by resetting the limits accordingly.
Ultimately, business management is more
than merely setting limits for business lines up
to which a maximum volume of new business
can be generated. It is often also important
for a bank to know whether new business
below the limits set generates an adequate
return on the capital necessary for the busi-
ness.
At present, only a few banks apply economic
capital-based return considerations systemat-
ically. For one thing, their use is predicated on
the existence of the above-mentioned capital
allocation mechanisms, which not all banks
have implemented yet. In addition, many
banks see the regulatory capital requirement
rather than the economic capital requirementas a scarce resource and want to tie their ex-
pectations for future returns to regulatory
capital. Ultimately, however, many banks are
in a transitional phase, in which they are
gradually moving away from exclusively using
traditional measures of return, such as the
return on equity (RoE) and the return on
regulatory capital, to also incorporate more
complex indicators, such as the return on
risk-adjusted capital (RORAC).
SREP: evaluation of the ICAAP
by supervisors
Within the framework of the Supervisory Re-
view and Evaluation Process (SREP), super-
visors evaluate an institution’s ICAAP and
thus a bank’s internal process for measuring
and managing risk.5
In the SREP , supervisors’ main focus is on
whether the banks’ internal procedures and
processes guarantee effective risk manage-
ment. Each individual bank must demon-
strate to supervisors that the methods chosen
and the choice of risk types included can be
regarded as appropriate for that bank’s spe-
cific situation.
Whereas, for smaller banks with simple busi-
ness activities, it may suffice to have a risk-
bearing capacity concept that is geared tight-
5Work on the SREP has also been carried out at the
European level: the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors (CEBS), for instance, published standards for
maximising the convergence of the SREP design in the
individual member states. See CEBS, Guidelines on the

68ly to the regulatory minimum capital require-
ments and to which further relevant types of
risk (especially interest rate risk in the banking
book) have been added, large, internationally
active banks with a variety of business activ-
ities and a complex risk situation might well
be expected to have their own models for
market risk and the credit portfolio, and to
use them within the framework of integrated
present-value risk management.
In order to be able to assess the adequacy of
a risk management regime, supervisors must
analyse the respective institution at length.
The intensive dialogue between supervisors
and banks through supervisory discussions
and examinations is therefore a central elem-
ent of the qualitative supervisory approach.
On the basis of a bank’s internal methods,
supervisors judge whether the bank has ad-
equate risk-bearing capacity, ie whether they
agree with the bank’s assessment that it has a
sufficient quantity of internal capital to cover
its risks. Both when calculating the capital
requirement and determining the risk cover
fund, supervisors draw a clear dividing line
between internal and regulatory indicators. In
the SREP , the regulatory minimum capital
requirement is merely a yardstick with the
help of which, in the discussions with the
institutions, the level of the risks calculated
internally is validated.
Section 45b of the Banking Act fundamental-
ly allows supervisors to impose capital add-
ons owing to inadequacies in the ICAAP .
However, German supervisors will use this
option only in exceptional cases since theyhold that the best way to address flaws in the
ICAAP is generally to request improvements
to the bank’s methods and processes.
Both Basel II and the corresponding EU direct-
ive leave scope for individual designs for the
requirements as to the ICAAP .
Whereas the emphasis in Germany is on
qualitative elements, the Financial Services
Authority (FSA) in the UK orders the banks
which it supervises to maintain individualised
minimum capital ratios which, in some cases,
are well above the 8% required by Basel II.
US supervisors share the German point of
view, although their rules differ in detail from
Germany’s: whereas, in the United States,
large, internationally active banks have
already been required to have an economic
capital model since 1999, German supervisors
generally leave it up to the institutions to im-
plement suitable ICAAP methods.
The degree of self-responsibility regarding the
types of risk to be factored in also varies
worldwide. Whereas, in Germany, each bank
decides for itself which types of risk to include
and has to demonstrate to supervisors that it
has made the right decision, other countries
have special supervisory requirements as to
the design of the ICAAP . In the UK and Italy,
for instance, every bank is required to quan-
tify risk concentrations in the ICAAP . In add-
ition, the FSA requires all banks to quantify
pension risks in the ICAAP owing to the fact
that they, as employers, are highly involved in
their employees’ old-age pension plans.Other

69International differences also exist with re-
gard to stress testing requirements. The FSA
requires the conduct of stress tests that re-
flect an economic downturn, such as is likely
to occur on average once every 25 years.
Spanish supervisors require advanced banks
to produce a self-developed stress test; small-
er banks are allowed a 10% general add-on
to the minimum capital requirements to cover
adverse market conditions. The German ap-
proach requires the analysis of appropriate
scenarios and leaves it up to the institutions
to design these scenarios in line with their
own specific business and risk situations.
Preliminary supervisory evaluation
of the economic capital concepts
in German banks
As early as 2004 and 2005, the Deutsche
Bundesbank, together with BaFin, conducted
a study at several German banks on the sta-
tus of the implementation of economic cap-
ital concepts. A comparison with the current
project reveals a mixed picture. Although it is
good that all of the banks analysed thus far
have now developed risk-bearing capacity
concepts, the progress made by the institu-
tions in their implementation still varies con-
siderably. The background to this is probably,
in many cases, that the implementation of
the advanced risk measurement approaches
for regulatory capital adequacy has tied up a
large volume of resources over the past few
years. With the most stressful phase of this
implementation process now nearing the
end, it is to be expected that the institutionswill focus more strongly on improving the
elective ICAAP elements.
Irrespective of the degree of complexity of
the risk measurement systems, the majority
of large German banks are still in the process
of systematically and fully implementing an
economic capital management system. The
risk-bearing capacity concepts have been im-
plemented well at an overall bank level; how-
ever, the degree to which they are being used
to generate management stimuli for individ-
ual business lines and subportfolios varies
considerably, however.
In addition, it has become clear that only a
fraction of many limits is being used, which
means that, in practice, they can hardly pro-
duce management stimuli. In addition, some
banks have identified problems with parallel
management according to both regulatory
and internal capital if both systems send out
contradictory management signals. The insti-
tutions are aware that action needs to be
taken here and are therefore working inten-
sively on better integrating these concepts
into their operational management.
Along with the positive results achieved,
therefore, some issues have materialised
which require further improvement. Examples
include defining the key types of risk; in the
case of smaller institutions, in particular, they
are still heavily oriented to those risks for
which regulatory minimum capital require-
ments exist. Thus, business and distribution
risks are only rarely factored in, particularly by
smaller banks, whereas other types of risk,
such as market risk – which supervisors con-Developments

70sider to be immaterial in the case of individual
banks – are integrated into the ICAAP . Both
phenomena indicate that not all banks are
yet internally addressing the issue of the ma-
teriality of risks.
Risks deriving from concentrations in certain
regions, sectors, products and collateral, as
well as dependence on individual counterpar-
ties, are often not yet sufficiently taken into
account in the ICAAP . The turmoil in the
US subprime mortgage market and its impact
on individual German institutions has shown
that it is precisely concentrations of risk in
individual market segments which can cause
difficulties for banks.
Correlations between types of risk, which
lead to a reduction in the amount of overall
risk, are factored in only by some larger
banks. During on-site examinations, these
banks are requested to demonstrate that the
modelled diversification effects actually exist.
In individual cases, further efforts are neces-
sary here to furnish proof using realistic data
without merely resorting to expert judge-
ments.
The large, internationally active banking
groups generally aim for an integrated,
group-wide ICAAP . Given that their business
and risk management is often centralised,
this approach is logical and sensible. Local
management, however, must remain actively
integrated in risk management since it bears
corporate responsibility for the local subsid-
iaries. Furthermore, institutions must analyse
whether, in a crisis, capital can be transferred
within the group across national borders orthe realms of company law without any im-
pediments. Without wishing to pre-empt the
outcome of the international discussion on
this topic, from today’s perspective there is
much to be said for requiring banking groups
active across national borders to demonstrate
their risk-bearing capacity at the single-entity
level. The methods used by the banks, how-
ever, can certainly be developed and man-
aged centrally as long as they are suited to
the situation of any particular part of the
group.
In the area of capital planning, shortcomings
currently still remain from a supervisory per-
spective. One key element of the ICAAP is a
forward-looking assessment of the institu-
tion’s future risk and capital situation. Cur-
rently, most institutions have a planning hori-
zon of not more than one year, which cannot
yet be described as planning for the future
taking the business strategy and its associ-
ated risks as well as the risk-taking potential
required in the future into account.
Further deficits in the assessment of future
risks exist in the area of scenario analyses.
Scenario-based stress tests are necessary to
review whether an institution has a sufficient
risk cover fund even under certain adverse
market developments. It is the responsibility
of each individual institution to define those
future scenarios that are relevant and realistic
in the light of its business activities. However,
at present, many institutions conduct stress
tests only for individual types of risk in isol-
ation. There is often not yet an analysis of the
combined impact of adverse developments
on all types of risk. Therefore, extensive stressGroup-wide

in the ICAAP as a key corrective to the statis-
tically-based risk measurement procedures.
Summary
Most institutions are on the right track to im-
plement the ICAAP , although there is defin-
itely still potential for improvement from a
supervisory perspective. The large, inter-
nationally active banks are able to identify
their key risks and are working intensively on
the ever more precise measurement of these
risks. Smaller banks in many cases appear to
not yet have made as much progress in risk
measurement and are therefore often orient-
ed to regulatory minimum capital require-
ments.
Despite the fact that institutions’ measure-
ment procedures are becoming more and
more evolved, users must be aware that the
models can neither predict nor map every
possible market disruption. A model is not a
substitute for sound risk management but isonly a tool of internal risk management. The
users of model results must therefore possess
sufficient understanding of the limitations of
the models’ forecasting ability and also use
additional information, analyses and supple-
mentary procedures (such as the analysis of
stress scenarios) as a basis for their decisions.
This is a particularly important realisation in
the light of the upheavals on the financial
markets this year. Since the ICAAP is seen as
a dynamic process by institutions and super-
visors alike, it may be assumed that institu-
tions will use the experience gained in the
year 2007 to appropriately enhance their risk
management methodologies and models.
It is a major challenge for supervisors to
accompany the institutions in their develop-
ment through intensive dialogue. The strong
quality orientation of the supervisory ap-
proach in Germany means that, wherever
supervisors find any weaknesses in the ICAAP ,
banks will most likely be instructed to im-
prove their methodologies and procedures ra-
ther than be subjected to additional capital
requirements.
