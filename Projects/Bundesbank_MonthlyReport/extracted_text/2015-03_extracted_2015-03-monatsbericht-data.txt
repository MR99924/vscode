Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The first quarter of 2015 is likely to have seen a 
further sharp increase in German economic 
output following its surprisingly strong expan -
sion at the end of 2014. A continuation of this 
buoyant upward cyclical movement is indicated 
for the second quarter as well. The main drivers 
in this context are external demand, private 
consumption and, to a lesser extent, housing 
construction. Furthermore, there are signs of 
something of an upturn in corporate invest -
ment. The consumer climate, which has been 
sustained for some time now by a positive la -
bour market outlook and large wage increases, 
has gained significant momentum of late 
owing to considerable energy- related gains in 
purchasing power and additional government 
transfers. The fourth quarter of 2014 saw a dis -
tinct increase not only in private consumption, 
however, but also in the household saving 
ratio. The additional real scope for expenditure 
was therefore not yet being fully utilised. The 
sharp rise in retail sales in January indicates that 
this is now increasingly the case.
Industry
In seasonally adjusted terms, there was no fur -
ther increase in industrial output in January 
compared with its December level, which was 
revised upwards markedly by ¾%. The key fac -
tor here was probably a “bridge day” effect, 
signs of which were particularly evident in the 
automotive sector. The figure was still 1% up 
on the average level of the fourth quarter, 
which indicates the underlying upward trend in 
industrial output. Compared with the final 
quarter of 2014, the largest increase was in 
capital goods production at +1¼%, followed 
by intermediate goods at +¾% and consumer 
goods at +½%.The intake of orders in German industry in 
January was a seasonally adjusted 4% down on 
the month. Its level in December was extremely 
high, however. Orders on an average of De -
cember and January were thus 1¼% higher 
than in October and November. This applied 
equally to domestic orders, orders from the rest 
of the euro area and orders from non- euro-  
area countries. The key factor here was a larger 
volume of major orders. Orders of capital 
goods went up by 2% and orders of intermedi -
ate goods by ¾%. This contrasted with a ¾% 
decline in orders of consumer goods.
Industrial sales in January were 1¼% up on the 
month after seasonal adjustment. Compared 
with the average of the previous quarter, the 
increase was 1¾%. Growth in export sales 
(+2¾%) was significantly larger than the in -
crease in domestic sales (-½%). The rise in non- 
euro- area countries (+3½%) was sharper than 
in the rest of the euro area (+1½%). Seasonally 
adjusted exports of goods in January did not 
quite match the figure for the final quarter of 
2014 (-¾%). On a more informative two-  
month comparison of December and January 
against October and November, however, there 
was an increase of 1%. In nominal terms, im -
ports in January were likewise somewhat down 
on their level in the previous quarter (-½%). In 
real terms, however, they picked up markedly, 
chiefly on account of the decline in oil prices.
Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in 
January was 5% higher than the figure for De -
cember, which had already undergone a sharp 
upward revision. Compared with the average 
of the final quarter of 2014, there was an in -
crease of 4¾%. Output in the main construc -
tion sector rose by 2%, buoyed by the com -
paratively mild winter weather. Orders received

quarter of last year – more recent data are un -
available – did not quite equal their level in the 
third quarter, showing a decline of ¼%. This 
was due to a fall in orders, mainly from the 
public sector but also from industry, which was 
not entirely offset by the extremely strong in -
crease in demand for housing construction.
Labour market
The upturn in the labour market became 
stronger at the beginning of the year. The num -
ber of persons employed in Germany in January 
increased by a seasonally adjusted 42,000 on 
the month and thus somewhat more sharply 
than at the end of 2014. The year- on- year rise 
amounted to 408,000, or 1.0%. According to 
the provisional figures of the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, which are probably overstated 
owing to changes in the reporting procedure, 
the number of employees subject to social 
 security contributions showed an increase of 
2.0% on the year in December. The leading in -
dicators for the labour market of Ifo and the 
Federal Employment Agency signal that the up -
ward trend is continuing.
February saw a further marked fall in the offi -
cial employment figure. After seasonal adjust -
ment, there was a decline of 20,000 on the 
month, which was similar to the average of the 
preceding months. This gives an annual fall in 
unemployment of 121,000. The unemployment 
rate at the end of the period under review was 
6.5%. The labour market barometer of the In -
stitute for Employment Research (IAB) was un -
changed in February and points to a slight 
 decline in unemployment for the next few 
months.
Prices
Crude oil prices fell again in the first half of 
March after going back up for a time in Febru -
ary, but did not undershoot their low of US$47 
in the second week of January. In February, a Employment

barrel of Brent crude cost US$59 on average, 
which was still around 45% lower than its level 
one year earlier. As this report went to press, 
Brent crude was trading at US$54. The pre -
mium on crude oil futures was US$4¼ for de -
liveries six months ahead and US$7¾ for deliv -
ery 12 months ahead.
Due to oil price movements, import prices in 
January were perceptibly lower than in the pre -
vious month after seasonal adjustment. If en -
ergy is excluded, they went up owing to the 
impact of the euro’s appreciation, however. 
Producer prices for domestic sales fell in Janu -
ary and remained unchanged in February. Com -
pared with December, the year- on- year decline 
widened markedly to 4.4% in January in the 
case of import prices and to 2.1% in February 
for industrial producer prices.
Chiefly as a result of the recovery in crude oil 
prices, consumer prices in February showed a 
sharp seasonally adjusted increase of 0.6% on 
the month. Along with energy, food products 
also became more expensive and the prices of 
services showed a marked rise, mainly on ac -
count of package holidays. There was also a 
slight rise in the prices of industrial goods, and 
housing rents continued their subdued upward 
trend. The earlier year- on- year decline as meas -
ured by the national consumer price index (CPI) 
turned into an annual increase of 0.1% and 
moderated to -0.1% as defined by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). If energy 
is excluded, the CPI and HICP rates are 1.0% 
and 0.9% respectively.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
According to provisional data, the statutory 
health insurance scheme recorded a deficit of 
just under €2½ billion in 2014 following a sur -
plus of almost €2 billion one year previously. 
The clear deterioration, despite sharp inflows of contributions, was due to the generally high 
level of growth in expenditure, which was in -
tensified in particular by reversing the tempor -
ary increase in the manufacturers’ discount on 
pharmaceuticals. The situation was aggravated 
further by a €1 billion cut in the central govern -
ment grant, which had already been lowered 
by €2½ billion in 2013. The finances of the 
statutory health insurance institutions shifted 
from a surplus of just over €1 billion in 2013 to 
a deficit of the same amount in 2014. The 
health insurance fund went from recording a 
surplus of €½ billion in 2013 to a deficit of just 
over €1 billion in 2014. Thus the statutory 
health insurance institutions’ reserves fell to a 
total of €15.5 billion and those of the health 
insurance fund to €12.5 billion.2
At almost 4½%, the statutory health insurance 
institutions’ revenue increased sharply for 2014 
as a whole. In addition to a year- on- year rise of 
4% in the transfers from the health insurance 
fund, which are fixed in advance, other rev -
enue was also considerably higher.3 Growth in 
expenditure was even more robust (at just over 
5½%) owing, among other things, to an in -
crease of just over ½% in the number of in -
sured persons. At almost 10%, growth in 
spending on pharmaceuticals was particularly 
strong because the increase in the statutory Import prices 
significantly lower, producer prices  unchanged

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 Each statutory health insurance institution is required to 
hold minimum reserves of one- quarter of a month’s ex -
penditure at year- end, which amounts to around €4 billion 
in total (section 261 (2) of the Social Security Code Book V). 
The minimum reserves of the health insurance fund are 
one- fifth of a month’s expenditure, which currently 
amounts to just over €3 billion (section 271 (2) of the Social 
Security Code Book V).
3 However, this also includes differences between the 
amounts that the health insurance fund recorded as having 
transferred and the amounts that the statutory health in -
surance institutions recorded as having received, which 
also reflect changes in the institutions’ mutual claims and 
liabilities. This difference led to a decrease in revenue of 
just under €½ billion in 2013 but an increase of the same 
amount in 2014. It is thus possible that the cash balance 
has deteriorated by almost €1 billion more overall.Deutsche Bundesbank

manufacturers’ discount was essentially re -
versed at the start of 2014. A substantial rise in 
payments for hearing aids contributed to the 
very sharp increase in spending on therapeutic 
treatment and aids (8%). Spending on sickness 
benefit picked up again and amounted to 9%. 
Growth in spending on out- patient and in-  
patient care (at just over 4% and almost 4½%, 
respectively) was disproportionately low, but 
still higher than growth in income subject to 
compulsory insurance contributions. Overall, 
the main factor behind the statutory health in -
surance institutions’ deficit is not that the au -
tumn 2013 calculations underestimated the 
level of transfers from the health insurance 
fund that would be needed to cover expend -
iture, but that these calculations did not con -
tain the premium payouts and voluntary bene -
fits (totalling €1 billion) of some institutions.4
The health insurance fund recorded growth in 
revenue of just over 3% in 2014. Revenue from 
contributions was up by almost 4%, but the 
cut in the central government grant had a 
dampening effect. Employees’ contributions 
rose by just over 5% due to the very favourable 
developments in employment subject to social 
security contributions and per capita  earnings. 
However, at just over 2½%, growth in pension -
ers’ contributions was significantly weaker 
overall, despite a much more dynamic second 
half of the year driven mainly by benefit in -
creases for pensioners. Thus the health insur -
ance fund’s deficit was €2 billion lower than 
expected when the transfers to the statutory 
health insurance institutions were fixed in au -
tumn 2013 because developments in employ -
ment subject to social security contributions 
have proven to be considerably more favour -
able than forecast at that time.

is set to expand in 2015. The health insurance 
fund now transfers only revenue generated 
from the general contribution rate of 14.6% to 
the statutory health insurance institutions. 
Members no longer have to pay the uniform 
special contribution of 0.9% of income subject 
to compulsory contributions. Statutory health 
insurance institutions may set an individual 
additional contribution rate to cover their fund -
ing gap. At the start of 2015, this amounted to 
just over 0.8% on average. There is thus a dif -
ference of around €1 billion compared with the 
additional contribution rate of 0.9% that the 
group of statutory health insurance estimators 
calculated as necessary to cover expenditure. If 
their expenditure estimate proves to be correct, 
the statutory health insurance institutions will 
record a deficit of at least €1 billion. Statutory 
health insurance institutions may also record 
spending on voluntary additional benefits; 
however, premium payouts are no longer per -
mitted following the changeover to income-  
related additional contributions. The health in -
surance fund’s deficit has been forecast to total 
€2½ billion as the cut in the central govern -
ment grant (to €11½ billion instead of the 
regular €14 billion) is to be offset by using the 
health insurance fund’s reserves. As things cur -
rently stand, wages and salaries subject to 
compulsory contributions may well increase at 
a sharper pace than assumed by the group of 
statutory health insurance estimators in au -
tumn 2014, chiefly owing to more favourable 
developments in employment. This would rein 
in the expansion of the deficit expected for 
2015.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme re -
corded a surplus of just under €½ billion in 
2014, meaning that the result fell only slightly 
on the year. While revenue rose by just under 
4%, expenditure was up a little more at almost 
4½% even though there were no major special 
factors in 2014. Employees’ contributions rose by just under 4½% due to favourable labour 
market and wage developments. The rise in 
pensioners’ contributions was much slower (at 
just over 2½%) despite an acceleration in the 
second half of the year due, not least, to bene -
fit increases in the statutory pension insurance 
scheme. Overall, the public long- term care in -
surance scheme’s reserves were topped up to 
€6½ billion.
On 1 January 2015, the contribution rate was 
raised from 2.05% to 2.35% (plus an extra 
0.25% in each case for childless persons). This 
will generate additional receipts of just over 
€3½ billion, two- thirds of which are ear -
marked for higher expenditure, while the re -
maining third is to be used to set up a separate 
reserve. Additional receipts equivalent to one-  
tenth of a percentage point of the contribu -
tion rate will be paid into a precautionary fund 
administered by the Bundesbank. A capital 
stock is to be built up by 2034 which will then 
be gradually depleted and could curb the ex -Favourable

pected rise in the contribution rate over the 
subsequent period of around 20 years by ap -
proximately one- tenth of a percentage point. 
Of course, this will only be possible if the gov -
ernment refrains from using these growing fi -
nancial reserves for any other purpose and if 
the invested funds yield earnings that more or 
less keep pace with the growth rate of gross 
wages and salaries. The public long- term care 
insurance scheme will inevitably record annual 
surpluses – which will initially amount to just 
over €1 billion – while the reserve is being built 
up.
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market 
picked up again considerably in January 2015. 
Overall, bonds worth €141.7 billion were is -
sued, compared with €99.8 billion in Decem -ber 2014. After deducting redemptions, which 
increased slightly on the previous month, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own debt securities, the volume of 
outstanding domestic bonds rose by €12.0 bil -
lion. Foreign debt securities worth €11.3 billion 
net were placed in the German bond market, 
so that total sales of debt securities in the Ger -
man market in January amounted to €23.3 bil -
lion.
Credit institutions increased their capital mar -
ket debt in the reporting month by €9.1 billion 
net. On balance, this was predominantly attrib -
utable to debt securities issued by specialised 
credit institutions, the outstanding volume of 
which rose by €9.6 billion. Furthermore, a 
smaller amount (€0.9 billion) of mortgage 
Pfandbriefe was also issued. By contrast, there 
were net redemptions of other bank debt se -
curities, which can be structured flexibly (€1.1 
billion), and public Pfandbriefe (€0.2 billion).
In January, domestic enterprises issued bonds 
worth €2.3 billion net, compared with €0.2 bil -
lion in the previous month. On balance, these 
new issues chiefly involved securities with a 
maturity of more than one year.
The public sector issued own debt securities of 
€0.7 billion net (December 2014: net redemp -
tions in the amount of €16.9 billion). This was 
due, on balance, exclusively to the countries 
that increased their capital market debt by €1.0 
billion. Central government capital market 
debt, on the other hand, was down by €0.3 
billion net. In this context, it primarily redeemed 
ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) in the amount 
of €7.7 billion. This contrasted with net issu -
ance of two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze) worth €4.0 billion, Federal notes 
(Bobls) worth €3.5 billion and 30-year bonds 
worth €1.6 billion.
Non- resident investors were the main net 
buyers in the German bond market, adding 
€20.1 billion worth of German debt securities 
to their portfolios. Domestic credit institutions, Net sales in the

too, purchased bonds (totalling €11.5 billion 
net), with the focus mainly on foreign secur -
ities. By contrast, domestic non- banks sold 
debt securities worth €7.6 billion net.
Equity market
There was virtually no issuing activity in the 
German equity market in January. Domestic 
listed companies issued just €0.1 billion worth 
of shares overall. The outstanding amount of 
foreign equities in Germany increased by €0.7 
billion. Equities were purchased, on balance, 
exclusively by domestic credit institutions (€7.1 
billion), which were primarily interested in do -
mestic securities (€8.8 billion). By contrast, 
non- resident investors and domestic non- banks 
reduced their holdings by €5.9 billion and €0.4 
billion net respectively.
Mutual funds
In the reporting month, domestic mutual funds 
recorded significant inflows of €21.9 billion, 
€18.1 billion of which were to specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors. Of 
the various asset classes, mixed security- based 
funds, in particular, were able to attract new 
subscriptions (€10.2 billion), as were, albeit to 
a lesser extent, bond funds (€4.6 billion), 
equity funds (€2.7 billion), funds of funds (€2.2 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€1.0 
billion). In January, foreign investment com -
panies sold shares worth €2.1 billion in the 
German market. As in the previous month, 
mutual fund shares were purchased mainly by 
domestic non- banks (€20.1 billion). Further -
more, domestic credit institutions and non-  
resident investors purchased mutual fund 
shares for €2.4 billion and €1.5 billion net re -
spectively.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €16.8 billion in January 2015. The result 
was €9.2 billion below the level of the previous 
month. This was primarily attributable to lower 
net receipts on invisible current transactions, 
which comprise services as well as primary and 
secondary income. The surplus on the goods 
account likewise narrowed.
In January, the surplus on the goods account 
fell by €2.5 billion to €15.8 billion. Exports of 
goods were on a par with the previous month’s 
level, while imports of goods increased signifi -
cantly.
In January, the surplus on invisible current 
transactions declined by €6.8 billion to €1.0 bil -
lion, with the balances of both the primary in -
come and the services accounts deteriorating. 
Net receipts on primary income contracted by 
€3.9 billion to €7.7 billion. This was mainly due 
to a normalisation of other income following 
the payment of agricultural subsidies in Decem -
ber – as is standard practice at year’s end – 
under the EU budget. The decline was, how -
ever, dampened by the rise in interest receipts 
from long- term debt securities. Expenditure 
within this investment category had also de -
clined sharply, however this was more than off -
set by higher dividend payments. In the ser -
vices account, the €0.8 billion surplus recorded 
in December reversed to a deficit of €2.4 bil -
lion, largely as a result of reduced receipts from 
IT services. Moreover, receipts from research 
and development services and charges for the 
use of intellectual property declined more 
sharply than expenditure, and travel expend -
iture increased again. By contrast, the deficit 
arising from secondary income fell slightly by 
€0.3 billion to €4.4 billion.
The international financial markets were influ -
enced in the opening month of this year by the

man cross- border portfolio investment gener -
ated net capital imports of €3.4 billion in Janu -
ary. Non- resident investors acquired German 
securities worth a total of €15.7 billion net. On 
balance they disposed of German shares (€5.9 
billion) while substantially increasing their hold -
ings of domestic debt securities (€20.1 billion), 
showing a marked preference for money mar -

(€7.7 billion). By contrast, they parted with Ger -
man public sector bonds to the tune of €2.3

foreign securities holdings by €12.4 billion in 
January. While they disposed of equities (€1.0 
billion net), they mainly purchased bonds (€7.2 
billion) and money market paper (€4.1 billion) 
on balance abroad.
In January, direct investment generated net 
capital exports totalling €8.2 billion. This was 
chiefly prompted by resident enterprises invest -
ing €5.9 billion abroad and non- resident invest -
ors scaling back their investment in Germany 
by €2.3 billion net. Resident investors reinvested 
almost as many funds in foreign equity invest -
ments (€4.7 billion) as they made available to 
affiliated enterprises via reinvested earnings 
(€4.8 billion); conversely, they reduced their 
 intra- group lending (€2.9 billion). Non- resident 
investors, too, supplied German enterprises 
with funds via equity capital (€2.2 billion) and 
reduced the extent of lending within the group 
(€4.5 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment com -
prising loans and trade credits (where these do 
not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other investments saw net 
capital imports of €15.3 billion in January. This 
was caused by substantial inflows of funds on

(€24.3 billion net). By contrast, enterprises and 
households along with general government 
spent €5.2 billion and €4.5 billion net respect -
ively on investments abroad. The Bundesbank’s

Approaches to strengthening the regulatory 
framework of European monetary union
The financial and sovereign debt crisis has confronted the euro area and its member states with 
major challenges, and has yet to be overcome. Reforms have been carried out and measures 
taken in many policy spheres. However, earlier calls to create a political or fiscal union and to 
fundamentally reform the EU treaties seem to have been silenced by the decision to set up a 
banking union. There appears to be insufficient political support for a significant transfer of sov -
ereign powers from the national to the European level. As long as that remains the case, it is 
crucial to shape and strengthen the existing regulatory framework of monetary union over the 
medium to long term in such a way that it can reliably and lastingly deliver on its promise to act 
as a union of stability.
Despite all the coordination mechanisms in place, the euro- area member states have more or less 
free rein in economic and fiscal policy. Conversely, individual member states are responsible for 
their own debt, and both monetary financing and joint liability are prohibited. This accords with 
the fundamental principle that governments – and investors – should be accountable for their 
own actions. This implies that monetary union also has to be able to withstand the extreme 
 scenario of a member state becoming insolvent. The original framework did not take adequate 
account of this aspect or, notably, its repercussions for financial stability. Although numerous 
reforms have been launched to combat the crisis, in many areas they have tipped the balance 
towards increased elements of joint liability. All in all, a number of challenges still lie ahead on 
the road to constructing a more cohesive framework that can better prevent future crises and, in 
particular, ensure that monetary policy remains focused on price stability.
This article outlines various approaches to making the European monetary union more resilient to 
crises in future. Strengthening financial stability is a key part of this process, and should include 
steps to curb the risks that sovereign solvency problems pose to particularly systemically import -
ant banks, eg by reducing the preferential regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures in the 
medium term and eliminating it altogether in the long term. Equally, the negative impact of bank 
distress on sovereigns should be minimised. To achieve this, banks’ loss- absorbing capacity needs 
to be further strengthened. Where necessary, orderly resolution must be possible even for large, 
interconnected financial institutions without tapping public funds. In the area of fiscal policy, 
budgetary surveillance and the implementation of fiscal rules should be improved, and consider -
ation given to an overhaul of the institutional framework. It also appears necessary to reinforce 
the disciplining effect of the financial markets on fiscal policy and to develop crisis management 
mechanisms which reduce moral hazard. Stability- oriented monetary policy crucially relies on its 
ability to resist pressure to step into the breach for overindebted banks or sovereigns.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overview
The financial and sovereign debt crisis was an 
acid test for monetary union. At the height of 
the crisis, some member states lost access to 
the capital market, and there was speculation 
that some countries might exit the euro or 
even that monetary union itself was in jeop -
ardy. While the situation in Greece has flared 
up again, the acute threats on the financial 
markets have receded on the whole, and the 
macroeconomic outlook has brightened. None -
theless, the public finance situation in some 
member countries remains problematic. Just 
under half of the member states are still post -
ing excessive deficits, and government debt 
has reached extremely high levels in some 
countries. At the same time, economic growth 
in the euro area is low. Although unemploy -
ment has been trending downwards since mid-
2013, it remains very high. Structural reforms 
are necessary, and the private sector, which is 
still burdened by very substantial debt levels, 
needs to deleverage. The task of acute crisis 
management has largely been left to the cen -
tral bank. Although the raft of non- standard 
monetary policy measures have helped to con -
tain the crisis and its repercussions, in some 
areas, the central bank is now operating at the 
very limits of its mandate. Among other meas -
ures, the Eurosystem has launched purchase 
programmes which are expressly targeted at 
the government bonds of countries facing high 
risk premiums.1 It has greatly expanded the col -
lateral framework for monetary policy refinan -
cing operations and taken contingency meas -
ures to provide massive liquidity.
This article first reviews the key causes of the 
crisis and the shortcomings it revealed in the 
regulatory framework underpinning European 
monetary union. Next, it briefly outlines the 
 action taken in selected fields to prevent similar 
crises from occurring in future (see pages 15 to 
37). It then looks at various complementary 
proposals to contain ongoing sources of risk 
and to fundamentally improve the monetary 
union’s resilience to crises going forward. A key aim in this must be to allow monetary policy to 
focus on its mandate and its core objective of 
safeguarding price stability and prevent it from 
being misappropriated to solve problems in 
other policy areas. The article focuses on the 
need to fill in important missing links in the 
areas of financial stability (see pages 22 to 29), 
which has proved to be an Achilles’ heel in the 
current regulatory framework, and fiscal policy, 
which lay at the heart of the sovereign debt 
crisis (see pages  29 to 34). In addition, it 
touches upon macroeconomic policy aspects 
(see pages 34 and 35) and monetary policy 
facets (see pages 35 and 36).
Loopholes in the original 
regulatory framework, 
and reforms launched
Pillars of the existing 
 regulatory framework
The euro- area regulatory framework for mon -
etary and economic policy, enshrined in the 
Maastricht Treaty in 1992, is founded on two 
pillars.2 First, the Eurosystem was granted ex -
tensive independence and given a clear man -
date to focus on the objective of price stability. 
It was concurrently forbidden to lend to gov -
ernment entities or to directly purchase govern -
ment debt instruments (prohibition of monet -
ary financing). These strictures were designed 
to prevent the objective of price stability from 
being subjugated to competing political inter -
ests. The rationale behind this was the insight 
that a clear focus on stable prices is, in the long 
term, the best way for monetary policy to con -
tribute to sustainable economic growth and 
lasting high employment and that central bank Sovereign debt

independence must be legitimised by a clear 
and narrowly defined mandate.
Second, the Maastricht Treaty sought to safe -
guard the Eurosystem’s independence not just 
on paper but also in practice. Thus where an 
imprudent fiscal policy threatens to drive a 
state to insolvency, even a theoretically inde -
pendent central bank can come under substan -
tial pressure to avert the high short- term eco -
nomic costs of a sovereign insolvency by resort -
ing to monetarisation. To avoid this danger, 
public finances should be sound enough to 
fully ensure the government’s solvency at all 
times without the need for support from the 
central bank.
The intention was to safeguard sound public 
finances in the euro- area member states in two 
ways. First, budget rules were agreed – includ -
ing, notably, ceilings on government deficit and 
debt ratios. A budgetary surveillance procedure 
was set up to identify and promptly correct 
problematic developments. Sanctions were es -
tablished to penalise sustained and severe in -
fringements of the rules. However, there are no 
tools at the European level for direct corrective 
intervention in national budgets.
Second, it was hoped that market mechanisms 
would provide key incentives for sound fiscal 
policy.3 It was thus assumed that markets 
would impose interest rate premiums on coun -
tries pursuing unsound public finances so as to 
compensate investors for increased risk, which 
in turn would encourage fiscal policymakers to 
apply fiscal discipline. Not least to allow this 
corrective mechanism to take effect, a “no bail- 
out” clause for both the member states and 
the monetary union as a whole was introduced 
alongside the prohibition of monetary finan -
cing. The fiscal framework of the Maastricht 
Treaty thus centres on the individual responsi -
bility of both investors and national fiscal pol -
icies; it rules out monetary policy measures 
aimed at shoring up fiscal sustainability and 
bail- outs at the expense of the union as a 
whole or of other member states. These provi -sions are designed to ensure that policymakers 
also bear the consequences of their decisions 
(balance between liability and control). Impli -
citly, the possibility in extremis  of a member 
state that is unwilling or unable to service its 
debt becoming insolvent is therefore integral to 
the framework of European monetary union.
Shortcomings of the original 
regulatory framework
This regulatory framework failed to prevent the 
sovereign debt crisis. Although the fiscal rules 
are, in principle, a suitable means of strength -
ening fiscal discipline, they were not rigorously 
implemented and enforced in the past. In add -
ition, amendments and exemptions made the 
rules opaque and undermined their binding 
force.4 Consequently, it was difficult for the 
general public to judge whether there was a 
valid excuse for specific infringements of the 
limits. Even before the financial and economic 
crisis erupted in 2008, member states often 
failed to adhere to the fiscal rules, and there 
was little political pressure to comply. Many 
countries’ public finances were therefore al -
ready in fairly poor shape in the run- up to the 
crisis. The true problems were also obscured to 
some extent by inadequate statistical data. Cre -
ative accounting and, in Greece’s case, pro -
longed, massive massaging of the official fig -
ures sometimes portrayed the public finance 
situation in an overly positive light.
Doubts about the solvency of some govern -
ments during the debt crisis were not solely the 
result of unsound fiscal policy developments, 
however. In the first ten years of monetary 
union, major macroeconomic imbalances had

strongly and some countries’ real estate mar -
kets boomed, price competitiveness deterior -
ated substantially, dependence on capital im -
ports rose and the factors of production be -
came increasingly concentrated in sectors with 
a domestic focus. The interest rate environment 
encouraged a sharp rise in household and cor -
porate debt, which was mainly funded via do -
mestic banking systems. All in all, the sustain -
ability of the prevailing economic situation was 
substantially overestimated, as were income 
prospects and the long- term value of many in -
vestments and assets. Public budgets initially 
benefited significantly from the strong domes -
tic demand, robust wage growth and more 
 favourable funding conditions. But the public 
finance situation then worsened with the onset 
of the crisis as huge corrections had to be 
made to macroeconomic imbalances, misallo -
cations came to light and the outlook for 
growth deteriorated dramatically. The original 
assessments of the structural budget position 
and the available fiscal leeway thus proved ex 
post to be far too optimistic.5
In a number of countries, extensive govern -
ment measures to shore up financial institu -
tions contributed to a huge deterioration in the 
situation and outlook of public finances. These 
institutions encountered financial distress in the 
wake of the financial and economic crisis be -
cause the high household and corporate debt 
they had co- financed turned out to be unsus -
tainable. The governments concerned mostly 
argued that an injection of public money into 
these institutions and the associated conver -
sion of private into public debt was the only 
way to avert a threat to the stability of the 
 financial system.
Overall, it was a long while before the financial 
markets began discriminating more strongly 
between sovereigns (and banks) with different 
credit quality profiles. Prior to the onset of the 
financial and economic crisis, long- term inter -
est rates on sovereign bonds showed hardly 
any spread, and fiscal policymakers were un -
daunted by the prospect of rising risk pre -miums. One reason for this may have been that 
the markets believed from the outset that a 
sovereign insolvency was highly unlikely and 
that a European rescue operation would be 
launched if the situation were to deteriorate 
sharply. Another reason was that the markets 
seemingly misjudged the sustainability of 
macroeconomic growth and thus the under -
lying robustness of some countries’ public 
 finances. Once they began to reappraise indi -
vidual states’ public finances, however, interest 
rate spreads widened sharply and abruptly in 
some cases as the markets increasingly lost 
confidence in the sustainability of debt levels. 
Some countries failed to counter these devel -
opments rapidly and sufficiently through a rad -
ical and credible switch in their fiscal policy 
stance.
This left some sovereigns facing the prospect of 
solvency problems. In addition, large amounts 
of funds were withdrawn from the banking 
systems in a number of euro- area countries. 
Given substantial dangers to financial stability 
in the euro area, exemptions to the rules were 
made so as to permit bilateral financial assis -
tance from other euro- area states, and support 
packages were adopted. In the face of intense 
pressure, the Eurosystem decided to expand its 
traditional toolkit by adding unconventional in -
struments, some of which stretched the limits 
of its mandate. While these measures pre -
vented the crisis from coming to a head and 
took the weight off the countries receiving 
support, they also weakened the accountability 
of sovereigns and investors as well as the cred -
ibility of the no-bail- out rule. Pressure on polit -
icians to push through more extensive institu -
tional reform in the euro area eased off. The 
introduction of emergency measures, which 
were not envisaged when monetary union was 
launched, was chiefly driven by concerns that a 
sovereign default in the European monetary 
union might impair financial stability not only in … support 
measures for  financial  institutions, …
… insufficient 
disciplining of fiscal policy by the financial markets, …… and dangers posed by  unsound public  finances to fi  nancial  stability

the country affected but also right across the 
euro area. These dangers were underestimated 
when monetary union was set up.
Reforms implemented 
or  initiated
A raft of reforms have been put in place since 
the onset of the crisis to more effectively avert 
future crises or make them easier to manage. 
Measures were implemented in the fields of 
 financial market regulation and banking super -
vision in an effort to eliminate the need for 
governments to use public money to rescue 
distressed banks, especially those which are 
potentially systemically important (“too- big- to- 
fail” problem). A major objective is to lessen 
the danger of a mutually reinforcing feedback 
loop between banks and public finances (sover -
eign- bank nexus). Measures taken to this end 
include a dedicated resolution regime for 
banks. This notably envisages bailing in share -
holders and creditors to bear a portion of the 
losses of a resolved credit institution, thereby 
obviating or minimising the need for govern -
ment support measures.6 The resolution regime 
is complemented by rules aimed at improving 
banks’ resilience. These chiefly comprise rules 
enhancing the quantity and quality of capital to 
be held by all banks but especially by systemic -
ally important institutions. Other reform com -
ponents are designed to diminish systemic risk. 
For instance, macroprudential instruments such 
as a countercyclical capital buffer and variable 
capital requirements for retail and commercial 
real estate lending can be deployed in future to 
combat an accumulation of risk in the financial 
system.7
In the fields of banking supervision and bank 
resolution the launch of the new banking union 
will spark major changes, not least with a view 
to protecting public finances from contagion 
from financial sector distress.8 The Single Super -
visory Mechanism (SSM) was put in place to 
harmonise prudential standards across all the 
participating member states. Amongst other things, it is hoped that this will counteract the 
temptation for national supervisors to give their 
domestic banking sector a competitive edge by 
regulating it lightly, whereas the resulting risks 
to stability could well spill over to other jurisdic -
tions where they might have to be borne by 
governments. The provisions concerning bank 
recovery and resolution and the Single Reso -
lution Mechanism (SRM) likewise seek to make 
injections of public money the exception rather 
than the rule in future. The envisaged liability 
cascade for bank resolutions is broadly similar 
to normal insolvency proceedings in that share -
holders will be first in line to bear losses, fol -
lowed by creditors. As a rule, these two groups 
will be fully liable for any capital shortfall re -
maining after the write- down and conversion 
of relevant capital instruments, although they 
are not to be worse off than under normal in -
solvency proceedings. If the ailing bank’s share -
holders and creditors cover at least 8% of the 
liabilities, the resolution fund can then, in isol -
ated cases, contribute towards funding the 
resolution. The resolution fund’s resources are 
divided into national compartments which will 
be progressively mutualised over a period of 
eight years. If these measures prove to be in -
sufficient, public funds can be drawn upon as a 
last resort.9 National public funds will need to 
be the primary source of funding until a com -
mon fiscal backstop (the design of which still 
needs to be agreed upon during the transi -
tional period) is up and running. If the member 
state in question is unable to raise sufficient 
funding, it has the option of requesting assis -
tance from the European Stability Mechanism

resort, a facility has also been put in place to 
recapitalise banks directly using ESM funds, 
subject to strict conditionality, if the provision 
of further ESM assistance loans would pose a 
threat to the sustainability of sovereign debt.10 
Finally, the envisaged harmonisation of national

In the fiscal field, fiscal policymakers announced 
at the height of the crisis that the existing 
budgetary rules would be tightened as a quid 
pro quo  for the granting of extensive financial 
support, and they adopted measures to avoid a 
repeat of the misguided developments that 
had occurred in the years preceding the crisis. 
Amendments to the Stability and Growth Pact 
(SGP) came into force at the end of 2011 which 
notably allowed sanctions to be imposed on 
euro- area countries which miss the medium-  
term goal of achieving a structurally close- to- 
balance government budget. Similarly, financial 
sanctions can now be imposed more quickly on 
member states which fail to carry out the pre -
scribed measures to correct an excessive def -
icit. The 2011 legislation also introduced special 
majority voting requirements which make it 
more difficult for the Council to reject a sanc -
tion recommended by the European Commis -
sion. The Commission’s role was strengthened 
because it was thought at that time that it 
would take a harder line than the Council. The 
amended SGP also specifies how government 
debt- to- GDP ratios in excess of the 60% ceiling 
are to be reduced, besides introducing meas -
ures that will enhance the quality of budgetary 
statistics. Furthermore, the 25 EU member 
states which adopted the Fiscal Compact have 
committed to enshrining in their respective na -
tional legislation uniform budgetary objectives 
that are largely on a par with the European re -
quirement to achieve a structurally balanced 
budgetary position in the medium term.
The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) 
and the European Financial Stability Mechan -
ism (EFSM), which were initially set up as tem -porary fiscal assistance mechanisms, were 
superseded by the ESM. This permanent sup -
port fund can provide temporary liquidity as -
sistance for illiquid, albeit not overindebted 
sovereigns in situations where it is thought that 
a failure to provide assistance would jeopardise 
financial stability in the euro area as a whole or 
in an individual member state. Countries re -
questing ESM liquidity assistance are generally 
required to sign up to adjustment programmes 
that are subject to economic and fiscal policy 
conditionality.11
In the macroeconomic field new macroeco -
nomic imbalance procedures (MIP) were intro -
duced.12 They are aimed at helping to avoid, 
identify and, where necessary, eliminate loom -
ing or existing macroeconomic imbalances in 
the member states if those imbalances might 
impair economic stability in the relevant mem -
ber state, the euro area and the European 
Union (EU). Much like the SGP mechanism, 
 financial sanctions can also be imposed under 
the MIP if a member state repeatedly fails to 
cooperate in correcting an excessive imbal -
ance.
Many of the reforms mentioned above take on 
board the lessons learned from the crisis and 
may contribute to preventing and resolving fu -
ture crises. These initiatives are likely to have 
fostered financial system stability, reduced the 
threat posed by the banking sector to national 
government finances and made investors more 
accountable for their investment decisions. The 
upshot of these measures, such as the intro -
duction of fiscal support funds, the single bank

measures, has been to distinctly increase the … budgetary

degree of joint liability within the euro area. 
While European- level surveillance and coordin -
ation were stepped up at the same time, their 
design and implementation were and are un -
satisfactory in some cases, and there is good 
reason to seriously doubt that the rules as they 
currently stand will be strictly applied.13 In ef -
fect, member states’ autonomy in economic 
and fiscal policy matters has been left largely 
intact. All in all, the reforms do not go far 
enough, and, with the exception of the bank -
ing union, the increase in mutualised liability 
has not been matched by the introduction of 
broader joint control mechanisms.14 This would 
suggest that the euro area is inadequately pro -
tected against fresh financial turmoil and the 
attendant risk of monetary policy being swayed 
by fiscal policy.
Template for further reform
Broadly speaking, two different models can 
serve as a template for a regulatory framework 
for monetary union that features reduced 
moral hazard. Both models should ensure that 
policymakers also bear responsibility for the 
consequences of their decisions (balancing 
 liability and control). The first of these models 
follows a decentralised approach and is rooted 
in the Maastricht Treaty. Apart from the single 
monetary policy, it is premised on extensive na -
tional accountability of member states. While it 
is true that European rules can encroach on this 
autonomy (in fiscal matters, for example), the 
European level ultimately has no power to 
intervene directly in national affairs. The notion 
of leaving decision-  making powers largely at 
the nation- state level is consistent with the no-
bail- out rule (which lays down that a member 
state’s debts cannot be assumed by other 
member states or the community) and the pos -
sibility of a member state defaulting.15
The other template centres on the idea of eco -
nomic and fiscal policy integration – in effect, 
fiscal or political union. This approach main -
tains a balance of liability and control by match -ing the increased mutualisation of risk with a 
surrender of (at least fiscal) sovereignty to a 
central European level.16 Calls to move forward 
in this direction came from various quarters at 
the height of the crisis.17 A cohesive fiscal or 
political union backed by a large political ma -
jority across all countries and sharing a com -
mon economic policy vision – a federation of 
states – would certainly be less vulnerable to 
crises overall than a currency union composed 
of autonomous member states if the latter 
does not appear capable of withstanding the 
insolvency of individual states. However, fol -
lowing the decision to set up a banking union, 
the politicians seem to have lost any interest in 
ramping up the pace of integration or embra -
cing fundamental treaty change, apparently 
because they do not believe that such steps, 
and especially the extensive surrender of na -
tional sovereignty, will enjoy majority backing 
in the member states.
As long as that remains the case, the focus of 
future reforms will need to be on improving the 
resilience of the existing framework, but there Two templates

is no getting round the fact that rules can only 
ever fulfil their purpose if they are rigorously 
applied in practice. Bearing this in mind, the 
following sections outline approaches that seek 
to strengthen the existing regulatory frame -
work based on national accountability. The 
guiding principles of this framework are en -
shrined in the European treaties and as such 
constitute the foundations of European monet -
ary union. Specifically, these are the no-bail- out 
clause, extensive economic and financial au -
tonomy of the member states, their citizens 
and investors, and the de jure  and de facto  in-
dependence of monetary policymakers in pur -
suing their primary objective of ensuring mon -
etary stability. The sections below consider at 
length key steps towards better safeguarding 
financial stability (see pages 22 to 29) and en -
suring sound public finances (see pages 29 to 
34) before briefly discussing options for im -
proving macroeconomic coordination and the 
role of monetary policy (see the summary on 
page 23).
Steps towards safeguarding 
financial stability
Sound public finances in the member states 
and a path of macroeconomic development 
that is devoid of serious and persistent imbal -
ances are important prerequisites for safe -
guarding financial stability in the euro area. 
However, extensive safeguarding of financial 
stability requires that it remains robust even if 
individual member states fail to prevent the 
emergence of macroeconomic imbalances or 
to rein in ballooning sovereign debt that might 
leave that country teetering on the brink of de -
fault. This objective primarily targets the bank -
ing system, given its particular systemic import -
ance for the stability of the financial system. 
But other potentially systemically important 
areas of the financial system, such as the 
shadow banking system, need to be addressed 
as well.18 Regulators and supervisors play a 
 pivotal role in the prevention of systemic crises 
in the financial sector. Yet if financial institu -tions nonetheless encounter stress, the onus is 
on monetary policymakers to step in with tem -
porary liquidity assistance for banks that are 
 illiquid but not overindebted. The task of the 
resolution authority and, at the end of the day, 
fiscal policymakers, by contrast, is to either re -
capitalise overindebted financial institutions by 
bailing in their shareholders and creditors, or to 
wind them up in an orderly fashion where a 
failure to do so would jeopardise the stability of 
the financial system. Part of the rationale for 
this is that this task involves large- scale deci -
sions affecting the redistribution of funds and 
debts. If fiscal policymakers fail to fulfil this 
task, monetary policymakers may come under 
pressure to step into the breach.
Two objectives need to be achieved in order to 
stem the spillover of risk from the government 
to the banking sector and vice versa . First, 
 financial stability needs to be maintained even 
in the unlikely yet conceivable worst- case scen -
ario of a haircut being imposed on sovereign 
bonds. Shoring up financial stability in this way 
is crucial for upholding the principle of national 
responsibility and the no-bail- out clause. 
Second, the risk of contagion channelling in 
the other direction –  from banks to sover -
eigns – likewise needs to be effectively curbed.
Reducing the risk of contagion 
from the banking sector to the 
government sector
The bulk of the measures rolled out so far to 
safeguard financial stability address the spill -
over of risk from banks to sovereigns. Although 
some progress has been made, further action 
still needs to be taken. To further reduce the 
risk of contagion, it needs to be ensured that 
systemically important banks, in particular, Safeguarding

ary policy  coming under pressureSovereign- bank contagion nexus must be effect -

as credit intermediation involving entities and activities out -
side the regular banking system. See Financial Stability

have deep loss- absorbing capacity. This in -
creases, for example, with higher capital, which 
absorbs losses and thus allows business oper -
ations to be continued. Some critics claim that 
stricter capital adequacy requirements drive up 
banks’ funding costs and might, as a result, 
stunt macroeconomic growth.19 As a rule, 
however, any higher funding costs are matched 
by macroeconomic benefits stemming from the 
potential improvement in financial stability. 
However, where higher funding costs result 
from the fact that tighter capital requirements 
eliminate or reduce implicit government guar -
antees, this is no reason not to impose stricter 
capital standards. At the end of the day, this merely removes an inappropriate subsidisation 
of banks’ debt financing.Summary of selected recommendations and measures

19 This line of argument is open to doubt, however. The 
Modigliani- Miller theorem, for instance, holds that, given 
perfect markets, an enterprise’s funding costs are unrelated 
to its form of funding. A rising equity capital ratio lowers 
the uncertainty of payment flows for shareholders and 
creditors alike, thus reducing the risk premium for both 
forms of funding. This offsets the additional cost involved 
in holding a higher proportion of (more expensive) equity 
capital. While it is true that market frictions, an asymmetric 
distribution of information or taxes may well drive up the 
cost of equity, empirical research suggests that the add -
itional costs are not substantial. See also European Central 
Bank (2011), Common equity capital, banks’ riskiness and

In order to increase banks’ loss- absorbing cap -
acity, the new capital requirements under 
 Basel III should be critically reviewed.20 Such a 
review should notably examine whether the 
risks that are not captured or are insufficiently 
captured in the risk models are adequately 
backed by capital (eg by the various capital buf -
fers). It is not least in the light of such risks that 
the risk- weighted capital requirements were 
supplemented by the introduction of an instru -
ment that is explicitly not risk- based, ie the 
 leverage ratio. From 2018, it will be possible to 
convert this ratio from a monitoring metric to a 
binding measure. In this case, too, it should be 
reviewed whether the minimum requirement 
of 3% currently being tested by the Basel Com -
mittee is appropriate.
Macroprudential monitoring and policy play a 
part in making the financial system more resili -
ent and also in adequately curbing cyclical de -
velopments of systemic risk. The instruments 
created for this at the European and national 
levels at least for the banking sector, such as 
the countercyclical capital buffer, the systemic 
risk buffer, and the option of higher risk weights 
for certain exposures, are essentially suitable 
for countering undesirable developments in a 
relatively focused way. The effectiveness of 
macroprudential policy will, however, hinge on 
how willing policymakers actually are to rigor -
ously deploy the instruments and to tackle un -
welcome developments, including in the face 
of political pressure if necessary, and on the ex -
tent to which any evasive actions can be 
thwarted. It would be wrong to place exagger -
ated expectations on macroprudential policy. It 
has only a limited ability to counter misguided 
developments originating from risky national 
economic or fiscal policy, as it cannot tackle the 
root causes. Tax legislation in many member 
states, for example, currently favours debt 
 financing over equity financing. This tends per 
se to weaken firms’ capital base, which means 
that bank loans can more quickly become non- 
performing in the event of negative shocks. In 
turn, this weakens the stability of the financial 
system. While, in this regard, macroprudential policy can strengthen the resilience of the 
banking sector and damp the cyclical dynamics 
of the financial system, the tax policy bias re -
mains in place. The existence of macropruden -
tial instruments therefore cannot be used as an 
argument for laxer regulation in other areas or 
for less prudent economic policy. This con -
straint is further underscored by the fact that 
the macroprudential instruments that are cur -
rently available predominantly seek to contain 
undesirable developments that originate in the 
banking sector. The task of extending the 
macroprudential toolkit to other areas such as 
the insurance sector or the shadow banking 
system is still in the early stages.
The concept of a capital markets union is cur -
rently being debated as a way of advancing in -
tegration of the debt markets and, above all, 
the equity markets. Dismantling the barriers 
and restrictions related to this can play a role 
here. This could allow the impact of asymmet -
ric shocks to be more widely spread and better 
cushioned within the EU via the financial mar -
kets. The desired stronger diversification be -
tween capital market- based and bank- based 
financing would have a similar effect.
In addition, more diversified bank lending in 
the euro area would disperse risk more widely 
and thus strengthen the banking sector with 
regard to problems confined to individual 
member states. Domestic banks, for example, 
would be less affected by the consequences of 
misguided fiscal policy developments in a coun -
try extending to the extreme risk of a haircut 
on government debt which, moreover, would 
normally be accompanied by a  recession and a 
rising wave of credit defaults in that country. 
However, the prerequisite for this is that credit 
risk does not rise on account of diversification.Capital require-
ments should be critically  reviewed

20 The requirements envisage a basic capital ratio of at 
least 8% of risk- weighted assets. Additionally, however, 
banks will need in future to hold various capital buffers on 
top of the minimum requirements in order to reduce the 
risk of the minimum capital requirements being undershot.

tutions will also be introduced.Deutsche Bundesbank

Comprehensively securing financial stability re -
quires independent and stringent banking 
supervision. Conferring responsibility for bank -
ing supervision on a Single Supervisory Mech -
anism (SSM) was a first key step.21 In order to 
avoid conflicts of interest with monetary policy, 
however, in the longer term banking super -
vision should not be based at the ECB but in -
stead at an independent institution that has 
the final say in supervisory matters, or at the 
very least, the decision- making structures for 
monetary policy at the ECB should be clearly 
separated from those for banking supervision. 
Against this backdrop, plans should be made 
to amend European primary law.
A country’s economic recovery can also be 
speeded up by making it easier for insolvent 
banks to exit the market and for new banks to 
enter the market. Uniform and accelerated in -
solvency proceedings throughout Europe for 
households and enterprises could reduce un -
certainties by facilitating faster identification of 
banks’ actual balance sheet position.
Some adjustment is required to the Single 
Resolution Mechanism (SRM), which is de -
signed to facilitate the orderly resolution also 
of systemically important financial institutions 
without recourse to government support meas -
ures. Given the extremely complex decision-  
making framework, there is considerable doubt 
as to whether bank resolutions can be carried 
out efficiently in the tight timeframe envis -
aged.22 This points to a continuing need to 
amend primary European law with a view to 
creating the legal basis for a genuine European 
resolution authority with efficient autonomous 
decision- making powers.
There is still a considerable need for improve -
ment to ensure that the risk of bank insolven -
cies is actually borne by the investors and to 
effectively reduce the probability and extent of 
future strains on public budgets from the finan -
cial sector. What is particularly problematic is 
that applying the bail- in tool to creditors in -
volves great discretionary scope. On top of this, it is uncertain how far the political announce -
ment that the banking sector will be called on 
to finance losses where necessary, possibly by 
way of ex post  levies, will be followed up. In 
order to reliably ease the burden on public 
budgets and to ensure that investors increas -
ingly bear risks themselves, there are a number 
of conceivable approaches besides the higher 
capital ratios already discussed. For instance, in 
the actual implementation of resolutions it is 
crucial that banks which are a gone concern 
really are rigorously resolved without using tax -
payers’ money. This will allow a track record to 
be established that negates the lingering ex -
pectation of an implicit government guarantee.
In addition, the bail- in of creditors could be 
made more credible ex ante  by obligating 
banks to hold sufficient capital and debt that is 
reliably available for bail- in in a loss event.23 
This is the objective of the minimum require -
ments for loss- absorbing capacity –  or total 
loss- absorbing capacity (TLAC)  – which the 
 Financial Stability Board (FSB) is aiming to intro -
duce for global systemically important financial 
institutions; these requirements are intended to 
make sure that there are sufficient levels of 
 liable capital and debt in a resolution event. For 
this to succeed, however, it must be ensured 
that the draft presented by the FSB in Novem -
ber 2014 is not watered down in the ongoing Independent

23 The Expert Advisory Committee to the Federal Ministry 
of Finance has put forward a proposal on this. According 
to this proposal, a significant requirement of bail- in- able 
capital would be that it may not be held by banks either 
directly or indirectly (eg via credit default swaps (CDSs)), in 
order to avoid the risk of contagion across the banking sys -
tem. Furthermore, a clear trigger for a liability event should 
be defined in bond contracts, and debt should then auto -
matically be converted into equity (comparable to “coco 
bonds”). Finally, it would have to be ensured that other 
debt positions are not automatically exempted from bail- in 
owing to the existence of these bail- in bonds. See Expert 
Advisory Committee to the Federal Ministry of Finance,

consultation process.24 Furthermore, regulatory 
requirements must restrict other banks from 
holding TLAC instruments in order to avoid 
contagion effects. The Bank Resolution and Re -
covery Directive (BRRD) also contains minimum 
requirements for liable equity and debt, in the 
form of minimum requirements for own funds 
and eligible liabilities (MREL).25 For this element 
of liability to be credible ex ante  in a resolution 
event, however, it would have to be assured 
that, as well as own funds, the liabilities 
covered by the minimum requirements, in par -
ticular, can actually be drawn on in the event of 
a resolution. Potential contagion channels in 
the financial system would have to be closed as 
far as possible. At the same time, the discre -
tionary scope for decision-  making in a reso -
lution event would need to be more clearly 
limited.
The additions to the safeguards that have al -
ready been implemented at the upstream 
stages discussed in this article are intended to 
rule out government support measures if pos -
sible. Nonetheless, a credible fiscal backstop 
may be required as the final step of the liability 
cascade to enable orderly resolutions also of 
systemically important financial institutions, if 
necessary, and to avoid excessive uncertainty in 
the markets. This would prevent central banks 
from being pressured to keep failed banks alive 
by providing extensive and sustained liquidity 
and thus avoid resolutions entailing consider -
able risk to financial stability. To align liability 
and control in the field of banking supervision, 
it would essentially be conceivable, following 
the transfer of banking supervision from the 
national to the European level, to likewise put 
in place a fiscal backstop at the European level. 
However, a prerequisite for this is that the leg -
acy risks on banks’ balance sheets that accrued 
under national responsibility are comprehen -
sively rectified first. What is more, the backstop 
would have to be structured in a way that 
avoids moral hazard that would discourage 
sound public finances and a sustainable eco -
nomic policy. The influence of national eco -
nomic and fiscal policy on risks in the national banking system grows inversely to banks’ de -
gree of diversification across national borders. 
A risky economic and fiscal policy would tend 
to be fostered if the attendant risks were fully 
communitised, whereas temporary advantages 
arise chiefly at the national level. Depending on 
the perceived severity of these moral hazard 
problems and the assessment of the effective -
ness of the corrective action through diversifi -
cation, bail- in, the European budget and eco -
nomic surveillance procedures and macropru -
dential policy, a more or less extensive degree 
of national loss retention for the costs of re -
solving a bank supervised at the European level 
would make sense.26
A final requirement for comprehensively secur -
ing financial stability is that no systemic risk 
builds up in other areas of the financial market, 
for example in what is known as the shadow 
banking sector. Specifically, macroprudential 
 instruments should be developed – in a similar 
way as for the banking sector – with respect to 
the improvement and further harmonisation of 
the framework conditions for decentralised 
structures in the financial system (eg for non-  
bank- based direct and indirect corporate finan -
cing), which is currently another objective of 
the capital markets union, in order to counter -
act any undesirable developments resulting 
therefrom.
Reducing the risk of contagion 
from the government sector 
to the banking sector
Equally as important as reforms relating to spill -
over risk from banks and the financial system to 
the government sector are reforms concerning Common fiscal 
backstop that minimises moral hazardShadow banking sector must not become a new source of  systemic risk

contagion risk in the opposite direction – ie 
from the government sector to banks and the 
financial system. These reforms should aim to 
make financial stability more independent of 
the development of public finances and highly 
likely to remain robust even in the scenario of a 
restructuring of government liabilities. This 
would also ease the pressure on monetary pol -
icy to take on responsibility for ensuring finan -
cial stability or sovereign debt sustainability. A 
core approach to tackling this issue likewise en -
compasses banking and financial market regu -
lation. The objective of any changes must be to 
limit banks’ sovereign exposure risk to such an 
extent that even strongly interconnected, sys -
temically important banks can either absorb fis -
cal stress events up to and including a com -
paratively extensive haircut on government 
debt or else ensure that they can be resolved in 
an orderly manner if necessary. It is important 
in this context to take account of second- round 
effects that arise because a sovereign default is 
usually accompanied by a slump in economic 
activity and a growing number of non-  
performing loans to private debtors in the 
country concerned.
Approaches to limiting the risk posed to the 
banking system by sovereign exposures include 
risk- appropriate capital backing for govern -
ment bonds, a limit on the volume of sovereign 
exposures held by a bank (large exposure limits) 
and treatment of such assets under the liquidity 
regulation that is commensurate with their ac -
tual degree of liquidity. A great deal could be 
achieved here simply by ending, or at least sub -
stantially scaling back, the regulatory exemp -
tions thus far afforded to sovereign debt from 
capital adequacy requirements and large ex -
posure limits.27 At present, capital essentially 
does not have to be held against banks’ expos -
ures to sovereigns in national currency, even 
though the sovereign debt crisis has clearly 
demonstrated that sovereign debt is by no 
means risk- free. Sovereign exposures have so 
far broadly been exempted from the existing 
large exposure limits, too. The large exposure 
rules are  de signed to prevent concentration risk in the banking system, with the aim being to 
stop a bank from running into difficulties itself 
when a debtor defaults.28
The consequences for banks of a haircut on 
government debt could possibly be further re -
duced by changing the contractual terms of 
sovereign debt instruments. The aim would be 
to create a sufficient volume of national bonds 
with relatively good credit quality for banks 
even in times of stress, and, if possible, to 
transfer the default risk more from bank bal -
ance sheets to other areas of the financial mar -
ket where any losses from a haircut will not 
lead to a systemic financial crisis. One option 
worth examining is the potential benefit of div -
iding individual national government bonds 
into first- loss and second- loss tranches as a 
complement to the amendment of banking 
regulations discussed above.29
Alongside banking regulation, a contribution to 
financial stability can also be made by ap -
proaches that, faced with the potential sover -
eign default of a euro- area state, envisage the 
timely initiation, rapid execution and predict -
able structuring of a relevant insolvency proced -
ure. Without such mechanisms, there are incen -
tives for both the debtor country and its credit -
ors to postpone a sovereign debt haircut. The 
government of the debtor country fears a loss 
of votes and image as well as negative reper -
cussions for the domestic financial system. 
Creditors of short- dated claims can currently 
press for the haircut to be delayed long enough Eliminating spill-
over risk from the government to the financial sector also in the event of  sovereign  insolvency

posal involves some joint liability elements, which run 
counter to the guiding principle of the regulatory frame -

that their claims are satisfied in full.30 This makes 
it more difficult to rapidly restore sovereign solv -
ency, prolongs uncertainty in the financial mar -
kets about the pending steps and increases the 
economic costs of a sovereign debt overhang 
via the knock- on effects on the real economy.31 
Reform approaches to mitigating the negative 
impact of sovereign insolvencies on the stability 
of the financial system should therefore be 
aimed at the timely triggering of sovereign in -
solvency and at putting in place a reliable, effi -
cient and transparent procedure for rapidly re -
storing sovereign solvency.32 Overall, however, 
it must be ensured that contract fulfilment and 
legal principles are upheld and that countries 
are in no way enabled to extricate themselves 
too easily from contractual arrangements with 
regard to sovereign debt.
Since 1 January 2013, all government bonds is -
sued by euro- area states with a maturity of 
more than one year have had to contain col -
lective action clauses (CACs).33 These aim to 
ensure efficient restructuring of outstanding 
 liabilities if the need arises by making it easier 
to make changes to the key terms and condi -
tions of a bond series that are binding for all 
creditors. To this end, the clause stipulates that 
the majority required to modify the terms and 
conditions for the individual bond series falls if 
a qualified majority across all bond series votes 
for a modification. This reduces any incentive 
for investors to hold out for full settlement of 
their claims at the cost of the entire group of 
creditors (holdout problem). However, this 
“two- limb” procedure cannot prevent a finan -
cially strong investor from blocking the restruc -
turing of an individual bond series by acquiring 
a blocking minority. In the longer term, a solu -
tion to this could be a “single- limb” aggregated 
voting procedure, whereby a qualified majority 
across all government bonds issued is sufficient 
to trigger a binding debt restructuring for all 
bonds regardless of the voting results for indi -
vidual bond series.34
In order to deter holdouts more effectively, the 
standardised bond contracts of euro- area states could additionally be critically reviewed with a 
view to restricting the pari passu  clause.35 In 
principle, this clause is designed to ensure the 
equal treatment of bondholders by issuers.36 At 
the very least, however, existing ambiguities of 
interpretation should be eliminated so that 
CACs introduced 
in 2013 could be stiffenedModified pari passu clause would mitigate holdout problem
30 Creditors of short- dated claims who have a blocking 
minority could, for instance, credibly signal that they do 
not consent to a potential debt restructuring.
31 The current debate about a haircut in Greece is taking 
place against a fundamentally different backdrop. Private 
creditors in Greece have already incurred a haircut, and the 
vast bulk of Greek debt now comprises assistance loans 
from public creditors. Although Greece’s debt ratio is still 
exceedingly high, extensive debt relief was provided by the 
very low interest rate charged on the assistance loans (from 
an economic perspective, granting very low interest rates 
and forgoing redemption payments for a protracted period 
are very similar to partial debt forgiveness). The sustainabil -
ity of Greek public finances is therefore significantly less 
strained than the debt ratio alone suggests thanks to this 
very limited interest burden. According to the European 
Commission’s latest forecast, Greek interest expenditure in 
relation to gross domestic product in the current year, for 
instance, is below that of Ireland, Italy and Portugal, even 
though Greece’s debt ratio is significantly higher.

35 In the global context, the IMF has attempted to 
strengthen contract-  based debt restructurings by tabling 
not only proposals for model clauses with the option of a 
single- limb majority requirement, but also proposals for re -
designing the pari passu clause, and has recommended 
their use in future international bond issues. See Inter -
national Monetary Fund, loc cit. The IMF proposals are 
based on the model clauses, revised shortly beforehand, 
issued by the International Capital Markets Association 
(ICMA). See ICMA, Standard Aggregated Collective Action 
Clauses (“CACs”) for the Terms and Conditions of Sover -
eign Notes, August 2014, and ICMA, Standard Pari Passu

36 It has only limited significance for sovereign issues as 
the concept of rank presupposes the option of liquidating 
the issuer’s assets (and the subsequent distribution of the 
insufficient proceeds to the creditors). The liquidation of an 
insolvent sovereign’s assets is hard to reconcile with the 
modern concept of a sovereign state and the inalienability 
of its sovereign rights, however.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
March 2015  
28

creditors who reject a debt restructuring (hold -
out creditors) cannot invoke the pari passu  
clause to build up potential pressure by threat -
ening to block payments to the restructured 
bonds. This reduces the holdout incentive for 
creditors and hence reinforces the incentive for 
all creditors to agree to a restructuring. As a 
result, the risk of a disorderly sovereign default 
diminishes.37
In addition, a framework and procedure could 
be developed in the longer term which would 
allow government bonds to be restructured in 
a more orderly and structured way than is cur -
rently the case.38 This could curb uncertainty 
about the steps required to restore sovereign 
solvency and mitigate systemic contagion ef -
fects and negative repercussions for financial 
stability. Any liquidity restrictions for the debt 
instruments that are to be restructured, the im -
pact on the domestic real economy and the 
level of the debt haircut required could poten -
tially be limited further. Regardless of such a 
framework, however, it must be ensured that 
financial stability is safeguarded to the greatest 
extent possible also in the not inconceivable 
event of a disorderly sovereign insolvency.
In connection with a potentially more orderly 
framework for sovereign insolvencies, the ESM 
could be given a greater role, and could con -
tribute to balancing the interests of debtors 
and private creditors as well as to achieving 
speedier agreement on restructuring. Sover -
eign debtors may in any case apply for liquidity 
assistance from the ESM, subject to certain 
conditions, until they regain access to the cap -
ital market. The prospect of such liquidity as -
sistance is likely to make it easier for the debtor 
country to agree to a restructuring. Creditors 
will probably submit to a haircut more readily if 
ESM assistance is credibly pegged to structural 
reforms and fiscal consolidation, thus giving 
them greater assurance that their remaining 
claims will then actually be settled.Approaches to anchoring a 
stability- oriented fiscal policy
Under the existing regulatory framework of the 
European monetary union, responsibility for fis -
cal policy lies mainly with the member states. 
They decide on the specific design of fiscal pol -
icy and also on whether the national govern -
ment debt is ultimately serviced. This wide-  
ranging autonomy in decision- making is essen -
tially consistent with the no- bailout principle. A 
central aim of stability- focused reforms in the 
field of fiscal policy must be to increase the in -
centives to pursue sound public finances.
Improve budgetary surveillance 
and implementation of fiscal 
rules
With regard to the fiscal rules, the main prob -
lem is not so much that they are fundamentally 
unsuitable, but more that they are seldom de -
signed and implemented systematically. This is 
illustrated, for example, by the European Com -
mission’s recent decisions to make greater use 
of the flexibility of the rules in future to further 
relax the requirements and also to loosen the 
requirements for sovereigns that clearly did not 
comply with the European Council’s recom -
mendations. At present, the Commission has a 
crucial role in monitoring budget developments 
and interpreting the European fiscal rules. Des -
pite its formal independence, however, it faces 
considerable political pressure and also pursues 
many different objectives simultaneously. A 
new European fiscal authority, which, similarly 
to the autonomous national fiscal councils, has Regulated

37 Holdout incentives could also be effectively curbed 
without modifying the pari passu clause if the payment 
streams of the parties taking part in a restructuring are im -
munised against the claims of creditors that have elected 
not to participate in the restructuring. See Committee on 
International Economic Policy and Reform, loc cit. Another 
change to the terms and conditions of government bonds 
is proposed below (see pp 30 and 31) with the automatic 
extension of the maturity when ESM assistance is granted.
38 See, for example, F Gianviti et al (2010), A European 
mechanism for sovereign debt crisis resolution: a proposal,

a clear mandate obligating it to solely assess 
budgetary developments in terms of compli -
ance with the fiscal rules should be better able 
to ensure objective monitoring as well as to 
conduct transparent and comprehensible an -
alysis. The new body could take over the Com -
mission’s role in the procedure and would be 
less exposed to the risk of making inappropri -
ate compromises at the expense of budgetary 
discipline.
Regardless of this institutional issue, the fiscal 
rules can be made more effective by making 
them much simpler and clearer. This would 
allow both the general public as well as the 
political opposition in the respective countries 
to clearly identify any breaches of the rules. 
This aspect is a key condition for the rules to 
have stronger binding force, as such public ac -
countability ensures that the rules have a dis -
ciplining effect on the political decision- makers. 
It would also be necessary to make all data 
publicly accessible, to largely eliminate the dis -
cretionary scope laid down in the existing rules 
for setting fiscal targets and assessing compli -
ance with them, and to tightly restrict and 
clearly define exemptions from the rules. Since 
responsibility for ensuring sound public fi -
nances remains with the member states, it ap -
pears advisable to restrict any European- level 
requirements more than before to the antici -
pated consolidation requirement and the dead -
lines for its implementation. The fundamental 
aim of the envisaged overhaul of the rules 
should not be to try and take account of every 
conceivable specificity by structuring the rules 
even more granularly, but instead to emphasise 
clear upper limits and thus strengthen the abil -
ity to implement the rules. Ultimately, the cru -
cial assessment gauge should not be the (sup -
posed) efforts of a member state, but rather 
the outcome. In this context, there must be a 
degree of acceptance that the rules cannot 
completely cover every single eventuality and 
that not all unexpected developments will be 
excused. What must be borne in mind is that 
the fiscal rules constitute agreed upper limits 
and that member states actually have extensive room for manoeuvre as long as the rules are 
complied with.39
Safeguarding sustainability by means of simple 
and transparent fiscal rules could be further re -
inforced by setting the scope of consolidation 
in the event of missed targets in such a way 
that not only is the deficit corrected, but the 
increased debt incurred in the meantime on 
 account of the deviation is also reversed. The 
binding force of the European budgetary rules 
could also be decisively enhanced if member 
states, in advance of any breaches, define con -
crete measures that will then enter into force 
more or less automatically and can be replaced, 
at most, by fully specified, offsetting meas -
ures.40
Promote incentives for 
 financial markets to press 
for sound fiscal policy
The actual or potential imposition of interest 
rate premiums on countries pursuing unsound 
public finances remains an important incentive 
for sustainable national fiscal policies in the 
euro area. This requires that creditors really are 
exposed to the full risk of any investment in 
government debt instruments and that they 
 assess this risk appropriately.41 Corresponding 
interest rate signals will then encourage gov -
ernments to adopt a sustainable fiscal policy. Simple and 
transparent rules create reliability and promote  effective budget -

40 Sustainably safeguarding stable public finances could 
also be achieved by introducing direct (tiered) rights of 
intervention at the European level in cases of severe and 
persistent breaches of the fiscal rules. These could also take 
the form of surcharges on common taxation instruments or 
deductions from certain spending categories, which are to 
be stipulated by the member states in advance and the 
amount of which will vary depending on the size of the 
breach. However, such rights of intervention imply a dis -
tinct reduction in national fiscal sovereignty (and hence an 
approach that is not discussed further in this article) and is 
highly unlikely to find a consensus at this point in time.
41 The prerequisites for adequately assessing the risks of 
an investment in government debt instruments include re -
liable statistics, the timely provision of relevant information, 
and transparent processes and methodology in the context 
of budgetary surveillance.Deutsche Bundesbank

However, if financial market participants expect 
fiscal or monetary rescue measures in the event 
of a crisis, this diminishes the perceived default 
risk of a misguided national fiscal policy, and 
market participants will, at best, require only 
small country- specific risk premiums. This 
weakens the disciplining effect of the financial 
markets from the outset.
Against this background, it is important that 
the principle of individual responsibility on the 
part of investors and member states is firmly 
re- established in future. There must be no pro -
spect that the no- bail- out principle or the pro -
hibition of monetary financing by central banks 
may ultimately be ignored. A key prerequisite 
for this, however, is that risks to financial stabil -
ity posed by a threatening sovereign insolvency 
are adequately contained by the aforemen -
tioned reforms (see pages 22 to 29), as the fear 
of a financial market collapse is ultimately what 
led to these principles being relaxed during the 
financial crisis.42
The collective action clauses introduced for 
euro-  area countries in 2013 can not only con -
tribute to greater financial stability, as ex -
plained, but are also a first important signal 
that investors will face a sovereign debt haircut 
if a country becomes overindebted. This signal 
could be underscored by proposals, already 
mentioned in the context of strengthening 
 financial stability, to reform the contractual 
terms of government bonds and introduce a 
more orderly insolvency regime for euro- area 
states. This could also bolster the credibility of 
a debt haircut as it would mitigate the implica -
tions for the financial system and the losses for 
the real economy, thus making the haircut eas -
ier to push through politically. At the same 
time, it must be ensured that the insolvency of 
a debtor state is not seen as an easy option. 
The imposition of conditions on economic and 
fiscal policy by a coordinating body, such as the 
ESM, could prove useful in this regard, as ex -
plained below.Inserting a clause into government bond con -
tracts that automatically extends the bond’s 
maturity if ESM assistance is granted could also 
be a useful addition. This would be an effective 
means of preventing private creditors from re -
ceiving full repayment of short- dated bonds at 
the expense of providers of public assistance. 
Moreover, private investors would be aware 
that they would be involved in any subsequent 
haircut. Their risk would rise accordingly, which 
would probably help to strengthen the discip -
lining effect of financial markets on fiscal pol -
icy.43
The aforementioned amendments to banking 
regulation – risk- based backing also of govern -
ment bonds, adjustments in categorising assets 
under liquidity rules and inclusion of public-  
sector bonds in large exposure rules – should 
additionally help to reinforce the disciplining 
effect of financial markets on fiscal policy. Elim -
inating the existing preferential capital treat -
ment of government debt instruments would 
curb banks’ demand for sovereign debt instru -
ments, particularly from countries with poorer 
creditworthiness.44 Overall, the measures 
should increase risk spreads for government 
bonds that have a higher probability of default 
and therefore make it less attractive for these 
countries to expand their borrowing. This 
would increase their incentive to pursue stabil -
ity- oriented fiscal and economic policies as a 
declining debt ratio would hold out the prom -Restoration of

42 Even if monetary policy generally has a certain role to 
play in safeguarding financial stability, it is limited by the 
prohibition of monetary financing, which places sovereign 
solvency protection beyond the scope of its mandate. 
Moreover, in a conflict of interests, the objective of main -
taining price stability takes precedence over seeking to 
contribute to financial stability. For more information see

ise of securing more favourable financing 
terms.
In the past, the ability of financial markets to 
effectively constrain the borrowing propensity 
of fiscal policymakers was limited by two key 
flaws. First, investors were very tardy in react -
ing to a deterioration in a country’s fiscal sus -
tainability and then tended to react very ab -
ruptly.45 The resulting rising interest burden, 
especially for sovereigns with substantial short- 
term borrowing, often made it harder for fiscal 
policymakers to take timely countermeasures. 
This being so, it would be better for states to 
fund their routine financing needs through 
longer- term debt as this would give them more 
time to react in the event of abrupt market re -
assessments. Second, in some cases fiscal poli -
cymakers were themselves slow to react to the 
interest rate signals. The aforementioned pro -
posals should help to mitigate these problems. 
Even so, there will still very likely be limitations 
to the disciplining effect of financial markets 
– as of fiscal rules – in the future. It therefore 
seems prudent to pursue both avenues in order 
to achieve sound government finances in the 
long term.
Need for a crisis resolution 
mechanism free from moral 
hazard
Despite reforms to the fiscal policy framework 
and supplementary measures to improve finan -
cial stability, the possibility of member states 
encountering solvency difficulties in future, 
along with the emergence of attendant sys -
temic risks, cannot be ruled out. A credible cri -
sis resolution mechanism is required for this 
contingency. Ideally, it should neither create 
moral hazard for national fiscal policymakers 
nor undermine the no- bail- out principle, and 
hence the disciplining effect of financial mar -
kets on fiscal policy. It should prevent systemic 
contagion effects in the financial sector and re -
lated spillover effects on the real economy. The fundamental objective should be the swift res -
toration of confidence in a country’s solvency.
The appropriate course of action depends on 
whether the state in question is merely illiquid, 
with a fundamentally manageable debt situ -
ation, or overindebted.46 In the first scenario, it 
may be possible to secure the state’s capital 
market access and solvency simply by agreeing 
a sustainable reform and consolidation pro -
gramme. However, even if a country is merely 
illiquid, such a programme typically needs to be 
implemented before capital market confidence 
in the country’s long-  term ability and willing -
ness to pay can be restored. It is therefore likely 
that temporary assistance from the ESM or 
other public institutions, or a debt moratorium, 
will additionally be required. Central banks are 
prohibited from making a financial contribution 
to the crisis resolution mechanism because of 
the prohibition on monetary financing.
If a country is overindebted, the first thing that 
must be done is to map out a sustainable debt 
reduction path. This is also a prerequisite for 
receiving liquidity assistance from the ESM. If 
debt sustainability is gravely endangered and 
unlikely to be achieved through conventional 
consolidation measures and reforms, extra-
ordinary fiscal measures should also be con -
sidered in order to avert a sovereign debt hair -
cut if possible. Particularly in cases in which the 
overindebted country is also home to consider -
able private wealth, a one- off redistribution of 
assets within that country might well be con -
sidered, for exemple, before any attempts are 
made to restructure its outstanding debt. This 
could, say, take the form of a one- off levy on Flaws in financial 
market con-
straints on  governments’

borrow

area sovereign bond yield spreads during the crises, ECB 
Monthly Bulletin, May 2014, pp. 67-83.
46 In practice, it is very difficult to differentiate between 
illiquidity and overindebtedness. Thus far, all euro-  area 
countries that have received help from an assistance pro -
gramme have been assumed to be illiquid but solvent. 
While the majority of these countries have since success -
fully ended their programmes and have been able to return

residents’ net assets. Such a move could make 
a noticeable contribution to ensuring the sus -
tainability of a country’s debt situation. In prin -
ciple, this would hold the electorate account -
able for its voting behaviour and sensitise it to 
the significance of such votes. This should in -
crease incentives to strive for a fiscal policy that 
is fundamentally stability- oriented. If a country 
is increasingly unable or unwilling to repay its 
debts, the possibility of a one- off wealth levy 
being required as part of either an adjustment 
programme or a debt restructuring can prevent 
the debtor state (and thus its electorate) from 
looking for a quick fix to its debt burden at the 
expense of the country’s creditors.47
If an overindebted country does carry out a 
debt haircut, a regulated procedure within the 
framework of a properly structured sovereign 
insolvency regime – potentially with the ESM as 
the coordinating body  – as described above 
would be preferable to an unregulated ap -
proach. If the ESM defines fiscal and economic 
policy conditionality under this framework and 
makes the provision of liquidity assistance de -
pendent on compliance with it, this could also 
potentially make it easier for private creditors 
to agree to a required debt haircut. In addition, 
the conditionality would counteract any incen -
tives the debtor state may have to seek a quick- 
fix solution at the creditors’ expense and would 
therefore also discourage unsound fiscal policy 
in the first place.
As proposed above, the inclusion of a standard 
clause in euro- area government bond contracts 
stipulating automatic maturity extension in the 
event that ESM assistance is granted is particu -
larly beneficial in this context. It not only im -
proves the disciplining effect of financial mar -
kets on fiscal policy, but also significantly re -
duces the volume of public assistance required, 
as financial investors would remain liable for 
their investment decision if ESM assistance 
were to be granted.48 Thus they can still be 
called upon if a subsequent debt restructuring 
becomes necessary.ESM assistance loans to bridge temporary 
 liquidity difficulties should be strictly tied to 
compliance with the reform and consolidation 
programme agreed with the given country. 
Even a change in government in the state re -
ceiving the assistance or in the creditor coun -
tries must not be allowed to fundamentally call 
these agreements into question. Reliable condi -
tionality is an essential prerequisite for tackling 
the root causes of solvency problems and for 
the country in question to regain trust and 
 access to the capital markets through its own 
efforts. It is also of key importance for gaining 
the confidence of the assistance- providing 
countries, which in effect provide ex ante  loans 
without a repayment guarantee. Perceptible 
interest rate mark- ups on the refinancing costs 
of assistance loans should likewise provide gov -
ernments with incentives to swiftly consolidate 
their public finances in order to lower the risk 
spreads as soon as possible and return to the 
capital markets. In addition, in order to protect 
taxpayers in creditor member states, public 
funds should generally be excluded from any 
subsequent restructuring, as is currently agreed 
in the case of ESM assistance loans.
Overall, the proposed measures for a more rig -
orous implementation of the European budget -
ary rules, the strengthening of the role of finan -
cial markets as a counterweight to fiscal policy -
makers’ propensity to borrow and an improved 
crisis resolution mechanism may help to achieve 
greater sustainability in public finances. In con -
junction with the aforementioned supplemen -
tary reforms to strengthen the financial sys -
tem’s loss- absorbency and to improve the re -
solvability of systemically important banks, 
these measures would contain the systemic risk

haircut and underpin the credibility of the no-  
bail- out principle.
Prevent or correct misguided 
macroeconomic develop -
ments
The introduction of the procedure for monitor -
ing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances 
has provided monetary union with an import -
ant crisis- prevention tool that was previously 
lacking. Its objective is to counteract cross-  
border risks and economic policy developments 
that cause negative spillover effects on other 
member states and, in particular, on the func -
tioning of monetary union. The reform was 
carried out within the existing legal and institu -
tional framework, which means it does not en -
croach on the legally enshrined national sover -
eignty in the area of economic policy. The im -
plementation of the economic policy recom -
mendations of the European level therefore 
depends on the willingness and ability of mem -
ber states to take these into consideration 
within the framework of their national eco -
nomic policies. An advantage in this context is 
that, in the course of monitoring, macroeco -
nomic imbalances can be identified by means 
of transparent analysis as this reveals problems 
to voters and capital market players, who can 
then put pressure on policymakers to take re -
medial action.
At the end of November 2014, the European 
Commission published a communication on 
the review of the EU’s new economic govern -
ance regulations.49 The gist of the communica -
tion, which seems reasonable, is that it is too 
early to draw meaningful conclusions regarding 
the impact of the procedure because of the 
short period in which it has been in force. This 
is underscored by the fact that, in a number of 
EU countries, macroeconomic imbalances were 
already in the process of being corrected by the 
time the excessive imbalance procedure was 
implemented in 2011, so that the procedure can only be put to the test in future periods in 
which imbalances first arise.
It must be said, however, that the European 
Commission’s evident reluctance to fully utilise 
the steps available under the procedure merits 
a critical assessment. Thus the number of coun -
tries in which it has identified an excessive im -
balance has risen from zero in 2012 to five in 
2015. Yet the European Commission has not 
initiated excessive imbalance procedure in a 
single case to date, and this year, too, it has 
not yet issued any proposals to initiate such a 
procedure. Furthermore, when assessing the 
extent of imbalances, the Commission places 
too much importance on member states’ re -
form promises, whereas experience shows that 
they are then only partially implemented or not 
implemented at all.50
A general problem, which ultimately also ap -
plies to the excessive imbalance procedure, is 
the often low acceptance in the individual 
member states of economic policy recommen -
dations formulated at EU level, which are often 
seen as encroachments on national sover -
eignty. As part of its review, the Commission 
therefore calls for incentives for better imple -
mentation of the reform recommendations by 
the member states, though it fails to spell out 
what form these incentives should take. It 
should also be noted that the European level’s 
diagnostic capability is not necessarily superior 
to that of the member states. This would sug -
gest that the subsidiarity principle should apply 
as extensively as possible in order to prevent 
attempts by the Commission at macroeco -
nomic fine- tuning. That being said, a purely na -
tional view that neglects the negative conse -
quences for other member states and monet -
ary union as a whole can be equally problem -
atic. For example, a smaller country might opt 
to pursue a risky structural policy –  such as 
growing a large financial sector – if it sees po -National sover-

tential advantages at the national level, while 
offloading a large portion of the negative risks 
onto the Community, for example via the bank -
ing union.
The proposal made in the debate on the poten -
tial deepening of economic and monetary 
union to use extensive financial payments to 
overcome national resistance to Brussels’ re -
form recommendations seems unconvincing.51 
Among other things, this would create incen -
tives to put up fierce initial resistance to re -
forms and then subsequently demand large 
amounts of financial compensation in return 
for implementation. It would be rather difficult 
to justify a situation in which funds are granted 
when unsound developments arise and are 
corrected but not when unsound develop -
ments are avoided in the first place.
Experience has shown that a comprehensive 
reform process in an affected member state 
can only really get off the ground and be suc -
cessful if a large proportion of national policy -
makers and voters are convinced of the need 
for the recommended adjustments and are also 
prepared to see them through. A stronger inte -
gration of national parliaments could therefore 
be helpful. However, future amendments to 
the coordination mechanism should avoid 
making procedures altogether too compli -
cated.
The role of monetary policy
The primary objective of the European System 
of Central Banks is to ensure price stability, and 
this is why it was granted independence, par -
ticularly from national governments. An essen -
tial counterpart to this independence is a mon -
etary policy approach that is focused as nar -
rowly as possible on the ESCB’s price stability 
mandate and kept at arm’s length from fiscal 
activities. Moreover, monetary policymakers 
must pursue this objective in compliance with 
market principles. The European treaties, which 
also govern the Eurosystem, are rooted in the principle that free competition is a prerequisite 
for the efficient allocation of resources. This 
makes it essential that monetary policymakers 
do not contribute to an imbalance between li -
ability and control in other policy areas.
In other words, monetary policymakers must 
ensure in the course of their activities that re -
sponsibility for liquidity management ultimately 
remains with the commercial banks and that 
banks’ funding costs are determined by market 
forces.52 Banks which cannot raise funds on the 
money and capital markets, or which can do so 
only at prohibitive expense, must not be kept 
on life- support indefinitely by the central bank. 
Otherwise this could lead to a misallocation of 
resources.
Banking supervision should not be based at the 
ECB but instead at an independent institution 
that has the final say on supervisory matters, or 
at the very least, the decision- making struc -
tures for monetary policy and banking supervi -
sion at the ECB should be clearly segregated so 
as to avoid conflicts of interest between the 
two policy areas. Against this backdrop, the 
aim should be to amend European primary law 
in the long term to achieve an institutional sep -
aration of monetary policy and banking super -
vision at the European level.53
Just like the abovementioned comments on pri -
vate responsibility for risks in the financial sys -
tem, where monetary policy interacts with fis -
cal policy, the risks taken by fiscal policymakers 
are the responsibility of national governments 
and must be shouldered by the member states 
themselves. This means that, in this respect, 
too, monetary policy must not be allowed to Financial incen-

undermine the disciplining impact of the mar -
ket. Measures aimed, for example, at reducing 
the financing costs of individual member states 
affected by rising risk spreads should be viewed 
critically in this context. Equally, monetary poli -
cymakers must not use the central bank’s bal -
ance sheet to communitise sovereign debts via 
the back door.
As both monetary policy and macroprudential 
policy target the financial sector, interactions 
between these two policy areas are inevitable. 
At the current juncture, however, there is only 
limited experience and scant knowledge in re -
spect of macroprudential instruments as to 
their mode of operation, calibration and inter -
action both among themselves and with mon -
etary policy. Nevertheless, the recent past has 
shown that the monetary policy stance can in -
fluence, in particular, the risk- taking propensity 
of financial market participants. Monetary poli -
cymakers should therefore also duly consider 
the implications of their decisions for the stabil -
ity of the financial system as a whole. However, 
they can only do so within the scope of their 
mandate. Ultimately, this suggests that monet -
ary policy should be applied symmetrically over 
the financial cycle and that policymakers should 
also weigh up medium and long- term risks to 
price stability. Such a symmetric monetary pol -
icy could help prevent financial market partici -
pants assuming too much risk.54
Conclusions
The crisis has pinpointed the need to reform 
the regulatory framework of monetary union. 
Many reforms and changes have since been 
implemented, often as short- term reactions to 
stress events. One of the fundamental ques -
tions raised is whether a fiscal or political union 
could be a viable objective. Given the evident 
lack of political support for such a scheme in 
the member states, it would seem that this 
path, along with comprehensive changes to EU 
primary law, is no longer on the agenda. As 
long as this remains the case, the existing regu -latory framework must be made as crisis- proof 
as possible in the medium to long term.
The current constellation of growing joint liabil -
ity, euro- area- wide risks to financial stability 
from potential unsound developments in indi -
vidual member states, and extensive national 
autonomy in economic and fiscal policy is con -
tradictory and unstable. This makes monetary 
union susceptible to new crises, and there is a 
risk of monetary policymakers being pressured 
into subjugating the objective of price stability 
to other general concerns such as securing 
 financial stability or sovereign solvency, which 
are actually the responsibility of other political 
actors. If the current basic principles governing 
economic policy in the euro area, such as ex -
tensive national autonomy in economic and fis -
cal policy, continue to prevail, corrections and 
additional measures will therefore be required 
in various areas.
In terms of financial stability, further measures 
to strengthen banks’ loss- absorbency and to 
improve the resolvability of financial institutions 
could promote a situation in which state fund -
ing for distressed banks is only required in ex -
treme cases in order to avert a systemic crisis. It 
is equally crucial to curtail negative spillover ef -
fects of unsound public finances on financial 
stability. For this to happen, it is essential that a 
sovereign debt haircut can be carried out in fu -
ture without raising fears of a systemic financial 
crisis. Only then will the no- bail- out principle 
applicable to other states, the Community, and 
monetary policymakers be credible and only 
then will financial markets more adequately as -
sess the risk of a state being unable or unwill -
ing to repay its debts. In this regard, consider -
able progress could be made if the existing fa -
vourable treatment of government debt secur -
ities in banking regulation were to be pared 
back in the medium term and abolished in the 
long term. Banks’ exposures to sovereigns Monetary policy

would then also require risk- appropriate capital 
backing and be subject to rules on large expos -
ure limits.
In the area of fiscal policy, budgetary surveil -
lance could be transferred to an independent 
institution mandated exclusively to safeguard 
sound public finances. In addition, the Euro -
pean fiscal framework, particularly the Stability 
and Growth Pact, should be tightened and, 
above all, actually implemented. If the Commu -
nity level is not to be granted rights of interven -
tion into the budgetary sovereignty of member 
states, then the disciplining effect of financial 
markets on fiscal policy will play an important 
role, irrespective of the fiscal rules. Lastly, the 
current crisis resolution mechanisms should be 
improved. For example, government bond con -
tracts could be adjusted (single- limb collective 
action clauses, pari passu  clause, automatic 
maturity extension upon the granting of ESM 
assistance), and a framework could be estab -
lished to make sovereign insolvency procedures 
as orderly as possible. The ESM could be given 
an important role in this context.In terms of macroeconomic developments, the 
introduction of the procedure for monitoring 
and correcting macroeconomic imbalances al -
ready represents a significant step forward. It is 
not yet possible to say with any certainty 
whether further reforms will be required, al -
though so far the European Commission has 
adopted a fairly lax approach to implementa -
tion. Possible options to improve the accept -
ability of the Commission’s recommendations 
by the member states include stronger integra -
tion of national parliaments and a streamlined 
and focused design of the rather complex 
European coordination frameworks.
All in all, the proposed reforms in the areas of 
financial stability and fiscal policy, in particular, 
would mitigate the risk of monetary policymak -
ers being pressured into carrying out tasks out -
side or at the very limits of their mandate. In 
the upshot, this could make an important con -
tribution to securing a stability- oriented monet -
ary union.Improve fiscal

The importance of macroprudential policy 
for monetary policy
The global financial crisis has sparked intense debate amongst economists regarding the future 
shape and role of monetary policy. Certain elements of the pre- crisis monetary policy consensus 
remain valid even today – in particular, the continued paramount significance of price stability. By 
contrast, one issue that remains open is the relationship between monetary policy and financial 
stability.
Although no definitive answers can be expected as yet, some initial insights have been gained. 
There is a broad consensus that a new policy area with its own set of instruments is needed in 
order to safeguard financial stability. The swift establishment of an effective macroprudential 
 policy therefore continues to have high priority. As both monetary policy and macroprudential 
policy measures initially affect the financial sector, interaction between these two policy areas is 
inevitable. However, at the current juncture, experience and knowledge of the functioning of 
macroprudential instruments, their calibration and the way in which they interact with each other 
and with monetary policy are rather limited. A monetary policy geared towards price  stability in 
the medium term is no guarantee on its own for the prevention of unwelcome developments in 
the financial markets that could spill over into the real economy and ultimately endanger price 
stability. The recent past has shown that the monetary policy stance can influence financial 
 market players’ propensity to take risks, in particular.
Monetary policymakers must therefore also duly consider the effect of their decisions on the 
 stability of the financial system as a whole. This suggests two things: first, that monetary policy is 
symmetrically designed over the financial cycle – that is to say, a monetary policy stance that is 
generally stricter during upswings even in the absence of inflationary pressures and is aggressively 
eased in the short term during marked downturns, but a less persistent expansionary monetary 
policy stance following a period of economic downturn – and, second, a trade- off between 
medium and longer- term risks to price stability. A symmetrical monetary policy in this vein could 
help to avoid a situation in which financial market participants take on too much risk.
In principle, monetary policy could also explicitly pursue financial stability as an objective in its 
own right. However, in addition to political- economic reasons, the primary obstacles to this are 
excessively high expectations placed on the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments with 
regard to safeguarding financial stability and a still- limited understanding of the way in which 
these two policy areas interact.
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy is sufficiently flexible to respond appropriately to future 
challenges. A fundamental change in strategy is not required. More work should be done on 
implementing an effective macroprudential policy; this would not only improve the stability of the 
financial system as a whole but also maintain the conditions in which the single monetary policy 
is able to ensure price stability in accordance with its mandate.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The global financial crisis has challenged the 
prevailing monetary policy paradigm. For ex -
ample, it has shown that low inflation rates 
and comparatively moderate business cycle 
fluctuations are not always sufficient to ensure 
financial stability.1 Although a number of differ -
ent monetary policy measures were imple -
mented all over the world following the out -
break of the global financial crisis, these were 
not always able to prevent a deep and pro -
longed recession. It is not least because several 
central banks were forced to resort to non-  
standard measures due to a zero lower bound 
on interest rates that sooner or later became 
binding that intense debate has been sparked 
amongst economists regarding the future 
shape and role of monetary policy.
Despite many differences in opinion, certain 
elements of the pre- crisis monetary policy con -
sensus remain valid: these include the con -
tinued paramount significance of price stability, 
the key role played by the independence of 
central banks and, in connection with that, the 
importance placed on a high degree of trans -
parency of monetary policy.2
By contrast, one issue that remains open is the 
relationship between monetary policy and 
 financial stability. Views on the topic range 
from a categorical separation of both policy 
areas and taking greater account of financial 
market developments in future monetary policy 
all the way to the proposal that monetary pol -
icy explicitly put the objective of financial stabil -
ity on a plane with that of price stability.
As unwelcome developments within the finan -
cial system were the key factors behind the 
scale and persistence of the global financial cri -
sis, new institutional conditions have emerged 
that need to be considered when examining 
the issue above. These include the establish -
ment of macroprudential institutions and the 
development of an effective set of instruments 
to go with them. This is intended to reduce sys -temic risk and strengthen the resilience of the 
financial system as a whole.3
As both monetary policy and macroprudential 
policy initially affect the financial sector, inter -
action between these two policy areas is inevit -
able. For example, banks’ lending is not only 
important for monetary policy transmission but 
is also relevant to macroprudential policy. This 
opens up the possibility of monetary and 
macroprudential policy measures complement -
ing each other, but also harbours the danger of 
a clash between the two. Therefore, neither 
policy area can blithely ignore the other com -
pletely. The future transmission of monetary 
policy is likely, in principle, to be changed by 
macroprudential policy – that is to say, by its 
institutional structure and the use of its instru -
ments.
This article will provide an overview of the cur -
rent academic and political debates on the 
interaction between monetary and macropru -
dential policy, from which normative conclu -
sions will be drawn. In doing so, it must be 
noted that, at the current juncture, experience 
and knowledge of the functioning of macro -
prudential instruments, their calibration and Financial crisis 
has shown that price stability is not enough to ensure financial stability

system’s ability to perform its key macroeconomic func -

liquidity provision, credit intermediation), especially in 
periods of stress and upheaval.

3 Another major reform in Europe with respect to financial 
stability was the launch of the European banking union. 
One of the central pillars of the banking union is the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which commenced oper -
ations in November 2014. This entailed the transfer of 
 extensive microprudential and macroprudential powers to 
the European Central Bank. See Deutsche Bundesbank,

the way in which they interact with each other 
and with monetary policy is still rather limited.4
Empirical evidence and 
 lessons learned from 
the  crisis
Empirical evidence for the 
euro area
Prior to the outbreak of the global financial cri -
sis, the inflation rate in the euro area hovered 
at around 2% (see adjacent chart). Long- term 
inflation expectations were similarly stable. 
Until the crisis broke out, the low volatility of 
the (expected) inflation rate was accompanied 
by minor fluctuations in business cycle develop -
ments, especially in gross domestic product 
(GDP).
By contrast, other macroeconomic aggregates 
and financial variables underwent major fluctu -
ations. For example, the relationship between 
asset prices and investment and overall eco -
nomic development in the euro area rose 
steadily on the whole until the onset of the cri -
sis. This growth was funded by a sharp increase 
in lending.
Thus, the economic and financial cycles did not 
develop along the same lines prior to the out -
break of the crisis, as signalled by the credit 
cycle, a major component of the financial cycle 
(see chart on page 42). While the credit cycle 
concept is based on the conventional business 
cycle, it examines patterns of private debt 
 rather than of GDP . The credit cycle is often 
 defined as the medium- term component of 
credit aggregate fluctuations.5 Credit cycles dif -
fer from classic business cycles in terms of their 
greater amplitude, in particular. In addition, ac -
cording to many economists, credit cycles last 
longer than business cycles, averaging a dur -
ation of eight to 30 years.6 The significance of 
the credit cycle rests on the observation that 
peaks in the cycle are often followed by finan -
cial crises.As recent experience has clearly shown, a sharp 
increase in lending coincided with commercial 
banks occasionally increasing their leverage 
ratio to a level that, as the financial crisis has 
demonstrated, resulted in systemic risk.7 The 
elevated leverage ratio led to a rise not only in 
the credit and liquidity risk of individual finan -
cial institutions but also, given the scale of 
interbank links, in the risk to which the financial 
system as a whole is exposed. In particular, ma -
turity transformation assumed extraordinarily Inflation rates,

ations and GDP were stable prior to outbreak of financial  crisis, …

cial variables underwent major fluctu-ations

high proportions. When short- term loans were 
no longer prolonged following the outbreak of 
the crisis, many financial institutions were im -
mediately forced to liquidate their assets in fire 
sales.8
The synchronicity of credit cycles will be an im -
portant factor in the future design of macro -
prudential policy in the euro area and in the 
potential role of monetary policy in safeguard -
ing financial stability. Synchronicity is unlikely in 
the euro area at the present time (see chart 
above).9 Centralised, cyclical policy measures 
alone – be they part of macroprudential policy 
or monetary policy – are therefore unlikely to be efficient. This is also why macroprudential 
policy in the euro area is, in general, organised 
at the national level (see the section on the 
new institutional set- up in the euro area and 
the EU on page 49).

Key lesson learned from the 
crisis: macroprudential policy as 
a policy area in its own right
Following the outbreak of the global financial 
crisis, central banks all over the world stabilised 
the international financial system and business 
cycle developments by cutting interest rates 
and implementing a raft of non- standard mon -
etary policy measures. Experience gained dur -
ing the crisis is putting not only financial super -
vision but also the “pre- crisis consensus on 
monetary policy” to the test.10 In simplified 
terms, this can be characterised as follows: 
price stability, operationalised by stabilising the 
inflation rate at around 2% in the medium 
term, was conceived as the primary monetary 
policy objective. Managing short- term interest 
rates was considered an adequate means of 
achieving this objective, with the interest rate 
floor deemed a theoretical curiosity with little 
practical relevance. Forecasts made by central 
banks played a major role in monetary policy 
decision- making.
Under this paradigm, efficient capital markets 
were generally assumed; imperfections in the 
financial markets and their potential macroeco -
nomic effects were largely disregarded. Tem -
porary inefficiencies were considered possible, 
but the majority view was that monetary policy, 
with its interest rate instrument, could effect -
ively do little to counteract such problematic 
developments. Considering how difficult it is to 
promptly and reliably identify certain unsound 
developments in the capital markets – in the 
form of asset price bubbles, for instance – the 
majority view until the outbreak of the financial 
crisis was that monetary policy could not con -
trol asset prices, therefore also making it un -
able to prevent the emergence of such bub -
bles, nor should it burst any asset price bubbles 
that may arise. A “benign neglect” approach11 
was thus adopted: monetary policymakers 
should only respond if, due to capital market 
developments, real economic adjustments 
were expected that not only suggested a revi -
sion of inflation and economic forecasts but also signalled an undesirable deviation from 
monetary policy objectives. In the event of an 
unwelcome, abrupt, downward revision, mon -
etary policy was to cushion the negative effects 
by supplying the financial sector with sufficient 
liquidity. It was thought that monetary policy -
makers should intervene only once a financial 
crisis was already taking place, minimising the 
macroeconomic damage through resolute 
interest rate cuts. Microprudential supervision 
– which focuses on individual financial institu -
tions – was regarded as an adequate means of 
preventing financial crises.
Experience gained during the crisis has, how -
ever, highlighted the fact that microprudential 
supervision alone is not sufficient to guarantee 
the stability of the financial system because it 
ignores the repercussions of developments at 
the level of individual institutions on the entire Experience 
gained during  financial crisis is 
putting “pre- crisis consensus on monetary policy”, …

ally assumed  efficient financial markets, to the test

financial system.12,13 In addition, it has become 
apparent that the macroeconomic damage fol -
lowing the outbreak of a severe financial crisis 
can only be partly stemmed by monetary policy 
after the fact.
In order to stem the risk of financial crises in 
future, the stability of the financial system as a 
whole is therefore now a policy objective in its 
own right. Macroprudential supervision is re -
sponsible for making a crucial contribution to 
this goal. One of its tasks is to help ensure 
that all financial market participants keep in 
mind the consequences of their actions on the 
stability of the financial system. Macropruden -
tial policy is now established at an institutional 
level as a policy area in its own right. Ideally, it 
works in two ways. On the one hand, it helps 
curb incentives for excessive risk-  taking ex 
ante. The instruments used should help en -
sure that market participants take account of 
the contribution that they are making to sys -
temic risk with their decisions (see the box on 
welfare-theoretical thoughts on pages 45 to 
48). On the other hand, various macropruden -
tial instruments increase the financial system’s 
resilience, thereby reducing its vulnerability to 
shocks and, in that respect, minimising the 
total macroeconomic costs of a financial crisis. 
Since a large number of different distortions 
and misaligned incentives in different areas 
(eg real estate market, general government 
debt) can entail the risk of instability, this new 
policy area requires its own set of instruments 
to be able to contain specific problems in the 
financial sector.14 These instruments include a 
range of capital surcharges, such as counter -
cyclical capital buffers for banks, and potential 
loan- to- value ratios for mortgage loans. In a 
more general sense, incentive- compatible de -
posit insurance schemes or functioning bank 
insolvency legislation could also count as 
macroprudential instruments.
The well- measured, well- communicated use of 
macroprudential instruments contributes to 
macroeconomic stability and, in this respect, 
should make it easier in future for monetary policy to perform its task and reduce the likeli -
hood of the need to cut interest rates to their 
lower bound and implement widespread non-  
standard measures in the event of a crisis escal -
ating.  
The new institutional set- up 
in the euro area and the EU
As a general rule, responsibility for macropru -
dential policy in the EU lies with individual 
member states (see chart on page 49). How -
ever, upon the launch of the SSM15 in Novem -
ber 2014, the ECB was entrusted with not only 
microprudential supervisory powers but also 
certain macroprudential information and inter -
vention rights in relation to the SSM member 
states. It is to be notified in advance of any 
planned macroprudential intervention at the 
national level because of possible cross- border 
effects. However, the ECB also has the power 
to tighten measures.16
The ECB has been responsible for banking super -
vision in the SSM member states since Novem -
ber 2014. However, it works in cooperation with 
the national supervisory authorities rather than 
performing all supervisory tasks itself: the ECB 
has assumed direct supervision of the 123 insti -

Welfare- theoretical thoughts on possible monetary policy 
objectives
In order to arrive at an optimal monetary 
policy for complex economies which are 
characterised by a large number of frictions 
and market imperfections, use is often 
made of theoretical models. An analysis of 
that kind is based on a welfare function 
which, based on the respective model, con-
tains those variables that are to be stabil-ised by economic policy measures. When 
optimising the welfare function, the model structure – and therefore the way in which economic policy measures affect the econ-
omy (ie the transmission process) – has to 
be taken into account as a restriction. It is 
possible, within the model framework of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) models, to derive for a given struc-
ture of the model economy the appropriate 
objectives for different policy actors. The 
relevant target function is derived from the 
utility functions of the actors in this model 
economy and is an approximate representa-tion of overall economic welfare. Which of the economic variables the decision- makers 
of certain policy areas ought to observe then results from the arguments that are contained in this (micr o- founded) target function (eg infl  ation rate or output gap). An optimal policy is one that maximises welfare assuming that the conditions of equilibrium that describe the dynamics of 
the model are satisfi  ed at all times.
Thus, taking fi  nancial market frictions into 
account can affect two points in the analysis 
of optimal policy: the welfare function and 
the equations that describe the dynamics of the model. However, it is not necessarily the case that frictions in the fi  nancial sector lead 
to a change in both the model dynamics 
and the welfare function. In this box, a sim-
ple New Keynesian model is used to show, 
fi  rst, the consequences only of modifying 
the model dynamics and, subsequently, also the consequences of modifying the welfare function. Only monetary policy is considered and further possible policy actors and instru-ments are disregarded. It is assumed that 
only the interest rate is available as a monet-ary policy instrument in order to achieve an 
optimal economic development for a given 
structure of the model economy. In prin-ciple, it is possible to examine the optimal 
policy of different policy areas, for example monetary, fi  scal and/or macroprudential pol-
icy, within the scope of a welfare analysis 
(see the box on pages 56 to 61).
General equilibrium models with frictionless 
fi  nancial markets generally come to the 
conclusion that a monetary policy that fo-
cuses primarily on safeguarding price stabil-
ity maximises welfare. This is refl  ected in 
the usual approximation of overall eco-
nomic welfare for these models:1

 .
The part in square brackets consisting of quadratic terms indicates those variables 
according to which monetary policymakers 
ought to gear their measures: the infl  ation 
rate, πt, and the output gap, xt (xt is usually 
defi  ned as the difference between the ac-tual output and the output that would 
occur if prices were fl  exible).2 Given that the 
relative importance of stabilising the output gap – refl  ected in the parameter λ
x – is typ-
ically low,3 the primary focus of monetary 
policy on price stability is to be justifi  ed with these analyses.

Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy, Princeton 
University Press. In the above formula, E0 represents 
the expectation operator in period t=0 , /u1D6FD.st is the rele-
vant discount factor, Ut is the utility function at period 
t and both Ω and λx are positive parameters which are

2 Owing to the quadratic structure, each deviation 
from a given target value is to be minimised: in the 
case of the infl  ation rate, this is (for reasons of simpli-
city) the value zero and, in the case of the output gap 
x*, an optimal value resulting from the model struc-
ture; ideally, this value is likewise zero.3 See also M Woodford (2003), op cit.Deutsche Bundesbank

The question that now arises is whether the 
same result is obtained when fi  nancial mar-
ket frictions are taken into account in the 
model: in other words, does a welfare an-
alysis which takes into account frictions in 
the fi  nancial sector lead to justifi  cation for 
monetary policy to stabilise the fi  nancial sector directly in addition to focusing pri-marily on price stability if no other instru-
ments – macroprudential policy in particu-
lar – are available? To answer this question, 
we refer in this box to recent research which integrates fi  nancial market frictions into a general equilibrium model and de-
rives a micro- founded loss function.4,5
It should fi  rst be noted that taking frictions in the fi  nancial sector into account evidently 
leads to modifi  cations in the structure of the respective model compared with the standard New Keynesian model in which only price rigidities represent a signifi  cant friction. This is refl  ected, in a fi  rst step, in changing equilibrium conditions that de-
scribe the dynamics of the model.6,7 Conse-
quently, this leads to changes in the trans-
mission process, and potential additional sources of shocks arise which have to be taken into account when deriving and, 
eventually, actually implementing the (opti-mal) monetary policy.
Based on the notion that the expectation 
value of a squared variable, E(X2), such as 
appears, for example, in the above- 
mentioned welfare function, can be broken 
down into a (squared) level term (mean), 
E(X)2, and a variance term, Var(X),8 it is 
possible to examine the consequences of the modifi  cations described above for a given welfare function. In contrast to the 
standard model, the changes as described 
above to the dynamics of the model can typically lead to a non- trivial trade- off be-
tween achieving the goal of the level term 
of the loss function and of the variance 
term of the loss function (which is affected 
by the probability and the scale of the cri-
sis). This is particularly signifi  cant if the scale 
of fi  nancial frictions (and therefore the risk and scope of a fi  nancial crisis) is model- 
endogenous and so also depends on mon-
etary policy itself. By contrast, it could also 
be assumed that the fi  nancial frictions fol-
low an exogenous process. The result of this is that the variance term of the loss 
function cannot be infl  uenced by monetary 
policy, which is in keeping with typical as-
sumptions of the standard model. The above- mentioned trade- off decision be-tween the mean and the variance would 
therefore not be relevant in the case of ex-ogenous frictions.

particular, when there is no complete set of state- 
contingent Arrow- Debreu securities that is able to spe-
cify payouts for all potential developments and through which complete risk sharing would be pos-sible. See also E M Leeper and J M Nason (2014),

6 In the simplest variant of a New Keynesian general 
equilibrium model, these conditions are described by 
two equations: fi  rst, the so- called IS curve, which re-
sults from the optimal consumption decision of house-holds and describes the aggregate demand side of the 
economy, and second, the so- called New Keynesian 
Phillips curve, which represents aggregate supply, de-
rived from the optimal pricing decision of monopolistic fi  rms under the assumption of price rigidities. In both 
equations, acting in a forward- looking manner, and 
therefore forming expectations, plays a crucial role.7 Amongst other things, the fi  nancial frictions are re-fl  ected in all the models used here as a so- called cost- 
push term in the New Keynesian Phillips curve. This produces a confl  ict of objectives between stabilising 
infl  ation and stabilising the output gap if the cost- push 
terms deviate from their stationary equilibrium values 
due to exogenous or endogenous developments.
8 In particular, the following applies. E(X2|A) = 
E(X|A)2 + Var(X|A), where X represents a macro-
economic variable and A  a given monetary policy 
orientation. The left (and therefore also the right) side of the equation can be transferred to the correspond-ing terms in the loss function. See also N Kocherlakota

If, on the other hand, the risk of a crisis in-
creases model- endogenously due to an ex-
pansionary monetary policy stance, this af-
fects the variance. The higher variance can be countered, however, by adopting a more restrictive monetary policy stance. Although this would lead to a deviation in the case of the mean (as a result of which the infl  ation 
rate target would, strictly speaking, be 
missed), the likelihood and/or the scale of a crisis would be reduced; this in turn would lower the variance (that of infl  ation, in par-
ticular). This gives the central bank the in-
centive to take action against developments in the fi  nancial markets that would increase the risk and scale of a crisis (leaning against 
the wind (LATW) policy), although that would result in a (temporary) deviation of the “classic” welfare- relevant variables (in-fl  ation and output gap) from their target 
values.9
Considerations so far indicate, then, that it can be desirable for the central bank to pur-
sue a policy of LATW solely on account of 
the model dynamics that are affected by 
 fi  nancial frictions. This (indirect) bearing of 
monetary policy on fi  nancial stability can exclusively be explained by the fact that 
monetary policymakers have an eye on the 
classic target variables of monetary policy – infl  ation and possibly the output gap – yet are faced with a specifi  c transmission 
process. It is crucial in this respect that the 
fi  nancial frictions are model- endogenous, which can occur due to mechanisms such 
as those described by the risk- taking chan-nel, for example.
In addition to the change in transmission, taking frictions in the fi  nancial sector into account can make itself felt in a second step in the form of a modifi  cation of the approximated welfare function. The com-mon denominator in the research studies considered here is that the above- 
mentioned equation of a target function in 
the standard model is, as a general prin-ciple, extended by additional variables; these variables “represent” the important 
frictions in the fi  nancial sector:10

t+λx(xtx⇤)2+λΦ2
ti
 .
In this equation, the welfare- relevant fi  nan-
cial variables that are contained in the re-
spective models are summarised by the vec-
tor in the last term, ie Φt.11 This variable 
takes a different form in each of the differ-
ent models: the interest rate level (De Fiore and Tristani, 2012), the interest rate spread (Cúrdia and Woodford, 2009; De Fiore and 
Tristani, 2012), the real consumption of re-
sources in the fi  nancial sector (Cúrdia and 
Woodford, 2009) or the risk premium (Carl-
strom, Fuerst and Paustian, 2010).12 Thus, 
the results from these models suggest that 
welfare is maximised not only by primarily 
stabilising the infl  ation rate but also by sta-
bilising selected variables of the fi  nancial 
sector as an objective in its own right. The 
different frictions that exist within the re-
spective models are therefore refl  ected not only in the dynamics of the model but also 
in the loss function, which makes the (po-
tential) confl  ict of objectives between the 
9 See also M Woodford (2012, Infl  ation Targeting and 
Financial Stability, NBER Working Paper 17967), which analytically derives within a New Keynesian model with 
(endogenous) fi  nancial frictions a LATW motive as an 
element of optimal monetary policy.10 This occurs, in particular, when the frictions in the 
fi  nancial sector are determined endogenously in the model. If the fi  nancial frictions follow an exogenous 
process, the additional term in the loss function can-
not be affected by policy measures and is therefore 
not relevant for optimisation.
11 The models examined here specifi  cally display the 
following fi  nancial market frictions. Borrowers are 
faced with a condition with regard to providing collat-
eral due to a principal-agent (“hold-up”) problem, which leads to so- called agency costs (Carlstrom, 
Fuerst and Paustian, 2010); they are not free to enter into fi  nancial contracts at their discretion, but only into those with the intermediation sector, for whose work real resources are necessary and which is faced with an 
asymmetric distribution of information; this gives rise 
to an interest rate premium (Cúrdia and Woodford, 2009). Information asymmetries between the lender 
and the borrower as well as the possibility of the cus-tomer becoming insolvent result in an interest rate pre-mium (De Fiore and Tristani, 2012).12 In addition, the models also generate combinations 
of these variables as well as correlation terms, eg of 
the fi  nancial variables with the output gap.Deutsche Bundesbank

tions continuing to fall within the remit of the 
national supervisory authorities.17
The national authorities therefore have more 
macroprudential surveillance powers than either 
banking supervision or monetary policy powers. 
Unlike monetary policy, which is uniform 
throughout the euro area, macroprudential pol -
icy can differ from member state to member 
state and take account of national factors. In-  
depth knowledge of national financial systems 
is thus required to correctly manage how instru -
ments are applied. At the same time, as the 
macroeconomic (and fiscal) costs of a systemic 
crisis – notably the real economic costs – are 
incurred primarily at the national level, responsi -
bility for macroprudential policy should also rest 
at the national level. The ECB’s ability to tighten 
measures mitigates the danger of delays or in -
action on the part of national authorities when 
measures need to be implemented (inaction 
bias). This reduces the risk of other member 
states being affected by excessively lax policy.However, the specific institutional structure of 
macroprudential policy still provides no informa -
tion on the relationship between this policy area 
and monetary policy. For a comprehensive break -
down of this relationship, the fundamental inter -
action between monetary and macroprudential 
policy needs to be identified and analysed in de -
tail.
Interaction between 
 monetary policy and 
 macroprudential policy
Price stability and financial stability are mutually 
complementary over the long term. Over the 
short to medium term, however, these two ob -
jectives can clash. For instance, macroprudential 
instruments designed to contain certain devel -
opments within the financial sector can run Unlike monetary 
policy, macro-prudential policy 
can take  account  
of  national 
 factorsvariables transparent.13 However, in the re-
search work mentioned above – as in the 
case of the output gap – the relative im-portance of the fi  nancial market variables, 
λΦ, is relatively low from an economic view-
point. This result should be considered pro-
visional given that research in this fi  eld is 
still at a very early stage. Moreover, it should 
be noted that the models used here make 
several simplifi  cations to be able to derive a 
micro- founded loss function. They disre-gard, in particular, different economic mechanisms that typical models for policy analysis display to be able to describe the 
observed data as accurately as possible (for example, sluggish wage- setting).
Thus, these concluding thoughts indicate that, in the theoretical perspective pre-
sented here, the direct stabilisation of fi  nan-
cial market variables may possibly rank as 
an objective in its own right alongside the 
stabilisation of the classic variables. How-ever, it should be noted that the target function is an approximation of general so-
cietal welfare and that the objectives need 
not be achieved exclusively through monet-
ary policy. In fact, as the main text illus-trates, there are strong arguments as to why the stabilisation of welfare- relevant variables of the fi  nancial sector should be transferred to macroprudential policy, in 
particular.
13 The fact that certain macroeconomic variables ap-
pear in the loss function does not necessarily mean 
that there is a confl  ict of objectives; only in combin-
ation with model dynamics is a confl  ict of objectives to 
be found. As is explained above, the models con-sidered here display cost pressure terms in the New 
Keynesian Phillips curve, which means that a confl  ict of objectives can indeed arise.

etary policy measures, too, can temporarily run 
counter to financial stability. (A conceivable 
case in point is that, at the zero lower bound 
on interest rates, monetary policymakers could 
be tempted to maintain an accommodative 
monetary policy stance whereas, from a macro -
prudential policy viewpoint, it might appear to 
make sense to tighten the reins in order to curb 
excessive asset price growth.) The recent past 
has shown that the monetary policy stance can 
influence financial market players’ risk appetite, 
in particular. This so- called “risk- taking chan -
nel”, largely unnoticed before the financial cri -
sis, should therefore be explained in more de -
tail below.
Financial agents’ risk  appetite18
Monetary policy and macroprudential policy 
“overlap” significantly in a central – and gener -
ally economically desirable – function of the 
 financial system: the taking up, management 
and sharing of economic risks.
Summarised in brief: the risk- taking channel 
describes how an expansionary monetary pol -
icy, notably in the form of low policy rates, in -
centivises commercial banks or other financial 
market players to take excessive risk.19 In this 
channel, an expansionary monetary policy 
leads not only to an increase in lending – as is 
generally described in the context of other 
monetary policy transmission channels – but 
can also lead to an increase in the overall riski -
ness of lending. If, all in all, “too many” risky 
projects are being funded, this can increase the 
likelihood of a financial crisis.
Thus, the monetary policy risk- taking channel 
describes how monetary policy measures, es -
pecially a change in the policy rate or the inter -
est rate path, can alter the perception of risk or 
risk tolerance.20 It thus encompasses the im -
pact of monetary policy measures on the per -
ceived or measured risk of investment port -
folios, asset valuation and funding costs.21 Un-Although mon-
etary policy and macroprudential policy are com-plementary in the long run, they may clash in the short and medium run

The chart shows how responsibility for monetary policy, mac-

divided between the national level (central banks/supervisory 
authorities)  and  the  supranational  level  (ECB/Eurosystem). While the Eurosystem is responsible for monetary policy, na-
tional central banks can exert influence over it via the ECB Gov-
erning Council. The ECB and national central banks/supervisory authorities share responsibility for macroprudential policy. Es-sentially, responsibility for banking supervision rests with the ECB.  The  ECB  has  assumed  direct  supervision  of  institutions 
classified as significant, with responsibility for the supervision 
of the remaining institutions falling within the remit of the na-tional  authorities.  The  European  Systemic  Risk  Board  (ESRB) 
and European Banking Authority (EBA) can exert influence over 
macroprudential policy and banking supervision.

necessarily per se associated with an expansionary monet -

level of the “natural rate of interest”, ie on the interest rate 
which is compatible with price stability. For more on the

servable to creditors, the commercial bank’s capital structure 
plays a decisive role. The second is that commercial banks’ 
financing costs are a function of the level of a risk- free refer -
ence rate. On the basis of these assumptions, risk appetite is 
determined largely by three forces or aspects, some of which 
go in opposite directions: a pass- through effect, a risk- shift-
ing effect and the level of indebtedness. It turns out that a 
reduction in the risk- free interest rate generally leads to in -
creased risk- taking (see Proposition 2). See also I Angeloni

Effects of monetary policy on risk taking1
The studies available to date on the risk- 
taking channel of monetary policy are 
based on detailed data for individual loans 
and support the existence of such a monet-
ary policy transmission mechanism,2 par-
ticularly in European countries.3 The benefi  t 
of using loan microdata is that the exist-ence of the risk- taking channel can be 
clearly identifi  ed, but leaves open the ques-
tion regarding the effects of the monetary 
policy risk- taki ng channel on the behaviour of banks as a whole – and therefore also its macroeconomic relevance.
In the following, data on heterogeneity in the banking sector are used to investigate 
the overall impact of changes in monetary 
policy on risk taking. The following analysis 
examines new loans and credit spreads across different bank types and credit risk categories. As no comparable data are available for the euro area, the analysis is 
carried out for the United States.
The banking data are taken from the Fed-
eral Reserve’s quarterly “Survey of Terms of 
Business Lending (STBL)”. This survey col-lects data on the gross volume of new loans 
(in US dollar) granted during the fi  rst full 
business week of the second month in each 
quarter. The STBL contains information on loan volumes and credit terms. This infor-
mation is available for all commercial banks 
as well as for three bank categories: large 
domestic banks, small domestic banks, and US branches and agencies of foreign banks. 
The sample period spans from the second quarter of 1997 to the second quarter of 
2008, ending at the point where monetary 
policy hits the zero lower bound. By using 
data on new loans, it is possible to take into 
account the fact that the risk- taking chan-
nel describes the incentives to engage in ex 
ante riskier projects. Finally, the STBL con-tains information on how banks perceive 
the credit risk of new loans. As part of the survey, banks are asked to assign new loans to one of four categories of increasing risk. The discussion below focuses on new loans 
categorised as either “low risk” or “high risk”.

able to use information on ex ante risk tak-
ing from the bank manager’s perspective.
The chart on page 50 shows the develop-
ment of high- risk loans as a share of total 
lending, as well as developments in risk pre-miums and the federal funds rate. It shows 
that high- risk lending was particularly 
prevalent, and that risk premiums were par-
ticularly low when the federal funds rate 
was at low levels for a prolonged period in the mid-2000s. This provides an initial indi-
cation of a possible negative relationship 
between high- risk loans and the policy rate. 
This phase (the mid-2000s) is therefore considered separately in the following an-
alysis.

ables’ reactions to movements in the policy 
rate are dependent on the monetary policy 
regime. The prolonged phase of low inter-
est rates (the “too- low- for- too- long” 
period) from τ1 = 2003 Q1 to τ2 = 2005 Q4 
is assumed to be the period when monet-
ary policy was excessively accommodative 
(Taylor 2013).6 The second regime refers to 
the remaining period.
Results
The charts on pages 51 and 52 show the 
dynamic effects (impulse response func-
tions) of loans and risk premiums to shocks 
which lower the federal funds rate by 25 
basis points in the two regimes. For reasons of clarity, the charts show 68% confi  dence 
intervals and the results for high- risk and 
low- risk loans only.
The results suggest that in “normal times”, 
only small domestic banks signifi  cantly in-
crease new lending to high- risk borrowers 
following an expansionary monetary policy 
shock (see the chart on page 51). The com-
position of loans granted by small banks 
shifts towards riskier loans. However, risk 
premiums are not increased to compensate for changes in the risk composition of loan 
portfolios (see the chart on page 52). In-
stead, banks shift their new loan portfolios 
towards riskier loans and charge a lower risk premium. The reduction in the credit 
spread of high- risk loans is, in fact, greater 
than that of low- risk loans. Borio and Zhu 
(2012)7 state the following with regard to 
the risk- taking channel: banks are willing to 
take on greater risks without raising their risk premiums to compensate for these 
risks. Although large domestic banks issue 
more new high- risk loans in absolute terms, 
the composition of their loan portfolios 
does not change signifi  cantly. Foreign banks do not change their risk composition when policy rates are not excessively low.Loan impulse responses to a monetary pol-
icy shock (of the same magnitude) do, how-
ever, differ signifi  cantly during a prolonged phase of low interest rates from those dur-
ing a normal period (see the chart on page  51). The results show that between 
2003 and 2005, additional risk taking is not 
only found for small but also for foreign 
banks. The risk premiums on high- risk loans 
decline for small and foreign banks, which 
suggests that these institutions did not in-
crease their risk premiums to compensate 
for the higher risk of the new loans (see the 
chart on page 52). As with the normal re-
gime, there is no evidence of a change in 
the risk- taking behaviour of large domestic banks here either.
Our fi  nding that the risk appetite of foreign 
banks increases in response to an expan-
sionary monetary policy shock in a “too- 
low- for- too- long” period supports the fi  nd-
ings of Bruno and Shin (2013) as well as 
Shin (2012).8 These authors emphasise the 
role that large European banks played in fuelling the US credit boom in the mid-
2000s. They argue that expansionary mon-
etary policy in the United States and the 
regulatory structure in Europe that allowed high debt leverage enabled European banks 
to take on excessive risks in the United 
States. Anecdotal evidence provided in Shin 
(2012) shows that foreign banks used 
cheap, short- term US dollar funding to in-

like other monetary transmission channels, 
such as the interest rate channel or exchange 
rate channel, the risk- taking channel is less 
tightly circumscribed; rather, it comprises a var -
iety of mechanisms.22 It can therefore operate 
in at least three ways.23
First, monetary policy decisions affect the valu -
ation of assets, income streams and payment 
flows. This means that a reduction in monetary 
policy rates will generally lead to an increase in 
asset prices and income streams,24 which for 
their part reduce (consciously or unconsciously) 
the perception of risk and/or increase risk toler -
ance. In a prolonged period of low interest 
rates, risk tolerance can rise undesirably sharply 
and market participants, in an environment of 
low volatility, can erroneously seriously under -
estimate the risk of an interest rate move.
Another way the risk- taking channel can oper -
ate is through an undesirably intensive search 
for yield, in that a reduction in the monetary policy interest rate will generally lower nominal 
yields; this means, for instance, that those fi -
nancial market agents whose long- term liabil -
ities are nominally fixed by contractual terms are 
willing to tolerate higher- risk investment in the 
expectation of achieving a higher return. Finan -
cial market agents could, for instance, bypass 
relatively safe government bonds and invest in -
stead in higher- risk, higher- return securities.25… through the 
valuation of assets, income streams and payment flows, …
… via the 
search for yield …vest in toxic assets generated by the shadow 
banking system. The results presented here 
complement these fi  ndings insofar as they 
show that the increase in risk appetite was 
not confi  ned solely to the securities mar-kets, but was also apparent in the trad-
itional lending business.
All in all, these fi  ndings provide strong evi-
dence of the existence of an active monet-ary policy risk- taking channel. Furthermore, the results suggest that the effects of mon-etary policy on the risk- taking behaviour of 
banks are particularly pronounced during 
prolonged phases of low interest rates.
Related work on the effects of monetary policy on risk taking in a macroeconomic environment complements the present 
study and corroborates its fi  ndings. Bekaert 
et al (2014)9 show that a loose monetary 
policy signifi  cantly reduces risk aversion (in terms of market- based measures), assum-
ing, however, a constant dynamic relation-
ship. Eickmeier et al (2014)10 document that 
risk taking is particularly pronounced in 
periods of low uncertainty. In such periods, 
an expansionary monetary policy leads to 
reduced funding costs and stimulates lend-ing (and therefore business investment and output) more strongly than in times of high uncertainty.

24 This aspect of the risk- taking channel bears a certain 
resemblance to the “financial accelerator” in that, due to 
credit market imperfections, a reduction in the monetary 
policy rate will ultimately also lead to an increase in bor -
rowing and in aggregate demand, therefore even amplify -
ing the original monetary policy stimulus through feedback 
effects. For more, see B Bernanke, M Gertler and S Gilchrist

the World Riskier?, Jackson Hole 2005 Symposium Pro -

54

The third and final way of activating the risk-  
taking channel is through monetary policy 
communication. The justified outlook of a 
sharp cut in the policy rate in a crisis will lead 
market participants to expect that they can re -
ceive all of the profits associated with height -
ened risk if they are successful but will not have 
to bear the costs in full in the event of a loss. In 
this respect, the crucial factor is not the low 
interest rate per se  but market participants’ ex -
pectations that the central bank will behave in 
a specific way. A more or less explicit promise 
by monetary policymakers to provide support 
in the event of a financial crisis encourages the 
development of collective moral hazard, which 
can contribute to financial instability.26
Three different perspectives 
on the interaction between 
 monetary policy and macro -
prudential policy
At the current juncture, experience and know -
ledge of the effectiveness of macroprudential 
instruments, their calibration and their inter -
action with each other and with monetary pol -
icy are still rather limited. Therefore, model 
simulations are highly necessary in order to 
study these questions (see the box on inter -
action on pages 56 to 61).
It should therefore come as no surprise that no 
consensus on the interaction between monet -
ary policy and macroprudential policy has been 
reached as yet. As a matter of fact, the current 
discussion in the literature can be broken down 
into different points of view,27 the main differ -
ences between which boil down to their an -
swers to a series of key questions: How effect -
ive is the new macroprudential framework in 
safeguarding financial stability? How depend -
ent are risk appetite or risk- taking on the mon -
etary policy stance? (And, as a corollary, to 
what extent can monetary policy fuel a finan -
cial crisis?) How great is the danger that a mon -
etary policy regime which also takes the safe -
guarding of financial stability into account in its decisions will undermine the credibility of a 
central bank in achieving its price stability ob -
jective?
Idealised perspective
The first perspective holds that monetary policy 
should remain focused on price stability – with 
the option, if desired by society, of adding the 
objective of stabilising the output gap or the 
utilisation of resources. Macroprudential policy, 
on the other hand, should stick to financial sta -
bility and use its own toolkit to achieve that 
goal.
This means that the key difference compared 
with the pre- crisis consensus lies in establishing 
an effective and credible macroprudential pol -
icy. Monetary policy can then, as before, focus 
exclusively on the objective of price stability. 
However, it should take into account the (insti -
tutional) changes in the transmission mechan -
ism resulting from the application of the macro -
prudential toolkit. This toolkit should not be 
used for the general management of aggre -
gate demand and thus not be directly geared 
to macroeconomic targets (inflation, utilisation 
of resources), for which monetary policy is re -
sponsible, in particular, as the policy measures 
taken would then cause distortions by possibly 
necessitating (inefficient) changes in behaviour 
going above and beyond their actual target. In 
this perspective, targeted monetary policy and 
macroeconomic policy mutually enhance each 
other’s effectiveness.28 The idealised perspec -
tive is founded on the assumption that each 
policy area – especially the newly created area 
of macroprudential policy – is capable of redu -… and expect -
ations concern-
ing monetary policy measures in a crisis

knowledge of macroprudential instruments is still limited, …
… which is why 
there is still no consensus on the interaction between monet -
ary policy and macroprudential policyIdealised per-
spective: monet -
ary policy should 
be oriented to narrowly defined objective of price 
stability, while 
macroprudential 
policy should be  focused on the 
objective of 
 financial stability
The key differ-
ence compared with the pre- crisis consensus lies in establish-ing an effective macroprudential policy

 Model- based analysis of the interaction between monetary 
and macroprudential policy
The fi  nancial crisis has shown that price sta-
bility alone is not enough to ensure fi  nan-
cial stability. As a response to the experi-
ences of the recent fi  nancial crisis, a new policy area – that of macroprudential pol-icy  – has been established and designed with the aim of countering risks for the  fi  nancial system as a whole. Yet this does 
not necessarily mean that monetary policy 
should not contribute to fi  nancial stability 
at all. As the different views outlined in the 
main text show, there is still disagreement 
about the extent to which monetary policy 
should be taking general developments in the fi  nancial markets into account. Nor is 
there any consensus in the literature about the form that the interaction between mon-
etary and macroprudential policy should 
take from a welfare- theoretical viewpoint.
In light of this, two questions are analysed below on a theoretical model basis. Does 
macroprudential policy have a positive impact on welfare? Should monetary policy respond to developments in the fi  nancial markets des-pite the existence of macroprudential policy?
To answer these questions, models have to 
be used which feature both a fi  nancial sector 
and a point of departure for monetary and macroprudential policy. In recent years, dy-
namic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) 
models have established themselves as the standard analytical tool for monetary policy 
issues. In these models, monetary policy has, because of nominal rigidities (such as price or 
wage rigidity), an effect on real variables.1 
These abstract and stylised models are also referred to as New Keynesian models. Ac-
cordingly, the models used here are based on a New Keynesian framework as in Christiano et al (2005) or Smets and Wouters (2007).
2
By contrast, there is as yet no generally  acknowledged analytical framework for macroprudential issues. This is true with re-gard to the choice both of the model class and of the macroprudential instruments; in most cases, banks’ capital is used as the in-
strument.3 Nor does there exist a generally 
accepted model framework which allows for the analysis of the interaction between mon-etary and macroprudential policy. Endeavours 
have increasingly been undertaken recently 
to include fi  nancial intermediaries or markets 
and, proceeding from them, so- called fi  nan-
cial frictions in New Keynesian models. New 
modelling variants have been developed 
since the fi  nancial crisis, in particular, though 
none of them have so far established them-
selves as a standard. Against this backdrop, 
three different models are included in the an-
alysis. These models differ substantially in how they model the banking sector and fi  -nancial frictions in order to take the model 
uncertainty described above into account.4,5

habit formation in consumption, adjustment costs in 
investment and variable capital utilisation. These speci-fi  cations are needed in order to harmonise the model results with empirical data.
3 In the following analysis, only the capital require-
ments for banks are examined as a macroprudential instrument. Consequently, fi  nancial stability policy is 
presented in a rather stylised manner.

5 Each of the models was estimated using Bayesian 
methods in order to base the welfare analysis on a real-
istic shock structure. To this end, data on GDP , con-
sumption, infl  ation, investment, banks’ capital, wages, 
short- term interest rates, lending rates for loans to 
households and enterprises, lending volumes to house-
holds and enterprises, deposit rates, deposit volumes and house prices for the euro area between the fi  rst quarter of 2000 and the second quarter of 2008 are 
used (sources: Eurostat and ECB). See C Choi, R Gerke, D Kienzler and J Tenhofen (2014), On the interaction of monetary and macroprudential policy, mimeo.Deutsche Bundesbank

In this way, it is possible to examine whether 
robust statements about the interaction be-
tween monetary policy and macroprudential 
policy can be derived across different model-ling variants.
Model variant A is based on Gerali et al 
(2010).6 The fi  nancial sector is characterised 
by banks with pricing power; they incur ad-
justment costs when deposit and lending rates vary. Households and enterprises are 
faced with credit constraints that are deter-mined by the collateral that is available (real 
estate and capital goods). Banks must ob-
serve a given capital ratio and incur costs if 
they fall below or exceed it. The capital ratio is the macroprudential policy instru-
ment. The chart above shows a stylised rep-
resentation of the fi  nancial sector in this 
model.
Variant B models the fi  nancial market based 
on Gertler et al (2012).7 Banks can procure 
funding via households in the form of short- term debt instruments (deposits) as well as capital increases. In addition, banks can ac-cumulate capital by retaining earnings. A 
so- called principal- agent problem between 
households and banks gives rise to an en-
dogenous credit constraint for the fi  nancial 
intermediary. Banks can use securities to their own private advantage, motivating households to limit the funds they make available to fi  nancial intermediaries. This credit constraint gives banks the incentive 
to accumulate capital by retaining earnings. The point of departure for macroprudential 
policy constitutes an overall capital ratio 
which banks take into account in their opti-
misation strategy. The chart on page  58 shows a stylised representation of the 
 fi  nancial sector in this model.

Model variant C is based on a paper by 
Benes and Kumhof (2011).8 Here, costs arise 
for banks when they verify the default of a 
borrower. Because the lending rate is set in-dependently of the actual future economic 
development, banks may incur losses from 
lending to enterprises if the actual develop-
ment deviates from the development that had been expected. A fi  ne is imposed on 
banks which fail to achieve the capital ratio 
set by macroprudential policymakers. This 
again motivates banks to accumulate cap-
ital through retained earnings. The chart on page 59 shows a stylised representation of the fi  nancial sector in this model.
The interaction between monetary and 
macroprudential policy is examined on the 
basis of simple rules for setting interest 
rates and the cyclical adjustment of capital 
requirements for banks.9 In the monetary 
policy rule, the nominal interest rate Rt is 
adjusted in response to the changing infl  a-
tion rate πt, output growth  and, where
applicable, real credit growth . More-
over, the interest rate is set depending on 
the interest rate level of the previous period, 
which smoothes the interest path to a cer-tain extent.
10The parameters ρR, κπ, κy and κb determine 
the strength of the response to changes to the relevant variables. The variable ε
R repre-
sents a monetary policy shock and –R  the 
equilibrium real interest rate.
8 See J Benes and M Kumhof (2011), Risky Bank Lend-
ing and Optimal Capital Adequacy Regulation, IMF 
Working Paper 11/ 130.
9 The choice of cyclical capital requirements for banks 
as a macroprudential instrument is driven by various 
factors. For instance, this instrument has high practical 
relevance as part of the Basel III regime. For this rea-
son, it is often discussed in the literature (see, for ex-
ample, P Angelini, S Neri and F Panetta, 2014, The 
Interaction between Capital Requirements and Monet-
ary Policy, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 46, 
pp 1073-1112; or J Benes and M Kumhof, 2011, op cit). From a technical viewpoint, all three models used here have a common point of departure for setting cyclical capital requirements for banks; this is not the case for other instruments such as loan- to- value- ratios.
10 Empirical studies of monetary policy rules typically 
fi  nd a statistically signifi  cant coeffi   cient for the interest rate level of the previous period, which is also the case in the estimation carried out for this study. This result 
may be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, it could be the result of an optimal monetary 
policy, which is usually characterised by very sluggish 
interest rate movements. On the other hand, the aca-demic literature holds that central banks possibly want to avoid large interest rate changes in order to prevent disruptions in the fi  nancial markets. See also C E Walsh

According to the macroprudential rule, the 
capital requirements mt respond to credit 
growth and to the capital requirements of 
the previous period (in order to avoid fl  uc-
tuations of the instrument that are “too 
volatile”).
The parameters ρm and φb determine the 
strength of the response to changes to the 
relevant variable and –m  represents the cap-
ital requirements in equilibrium.
A grid search is carried out to fi  nd for each 
of the models the combination of param-
eters for the two rules that achieves the highest welfare.
11 The utility function of 
households serves as the welfare criterion. 
The values of the smoothing parameters are fi  xed in the two policy rules, ρ
R and ρm.12 In 
this way, the grid search is carried out for 
the parameters κπ, κy, κb and φb.13
The following has to be borne in mind when interpreting the results. If the welfare- maximising parameter constella-
tion shows a positive parameter φb (and, at 
the same time, the parameters in the mon-
etary policy rule are different from zero), 
macroprudential policy as well as monetary policy plays a part in increasing welfare. If the welfare- maximising parameter constel-lation shows a positive κ
b, monetary policy should take credit growth in its interest 
rate rule and, therefore, also developments in the fi  nancial market directly into consid-eration.
The model simulations (see the table on 
page 60) indicate how important the mod-elling of the structure of the banking sector 
is with regard to the interaction between monetary and macroprudential policy as 
well as to the importance of fi  nancial mar-
ket variables in the monetary policy rule. 
11 A grid search involves creating a grid for the param-
eters to be varied and calculating the welfare criterion 
for each possible combination of parameters. A com-parison of the values of the welfare criterion identifi  es the combination of parameters that achieves the high-est value for the welfare criterion. The welfare criterion 
is the recursive formulation of the expected value of 
the sum of discounted period- utility functions.
12 These two parameters are fi  xed on the basis of 
mathematical restrictions. The smoothing parameter in 
the monetary policy rule ρR, is set at its estimated 
value. This possibility is not available for ρm, as the 
models are estimated without a macroprudential rule. The reason for this is that the estimation period for the models ends prior to the fi  nancial crisis at a time when 
macroprudential policy was not yet practised in Eur-
ope. That is why this parameter was set at 0.5 follow-ing an agnostic approach. A positive value for this par-
ameter may be explained by a wish not to cause too 
much uncertainty and volatility by abruptly changing 
the capital requirement for banks.
13 Perturbation methods are applied to solve the 
models. To this end, a second- order Taylor approxima-
tion is used in each case to allow for an ordering of 
welfare results for different parameter constellations.

According to model variant A, it is optimal 
from a welfare viewpoint if monetary policy 
responds to credit growth with interest rate 
changes yet macroprudential policy does 
not change the capital requirements in re-
sponse to changes in credit growth. Beyond 
that, monetary policy ought to respond 
only to changes in infl  ation. In model vari-
ant B, monetary policy should adjust the 
interest rate in response to changes in both 
infl  ation and output. Macroprudential pol-
icy should respond relatively strongly to de-velopments in credit growth, whereas mon-
etary policy should not respond to credit growth. In model variant C, on the other hand, monetary policy should respond to credit growth in tandem with a strong re-sponse from macroprudential policy. By contrast, the response on the part of the monetary policy interest rate to output 
growth should be weak, and the response 
to the infl  ation rate should be as weak as possible in order to just achieve a stable 
equilibrium.14
Thus, it is not possible to make a universally 
valid statement with regard to the optimal interaction between monetary and macro-
prudential policy across the different 
models. In light of these results, policy rec-ommendations that are based on only one 
model must be considered problematic. At 
the same time, the results support the rele-
vance of the research agenda with regard to fi  nancial market frictions and the inter-
action between different policy areas. Only if the modelled fi  nancial market and its im-
perfections are capable of refl  ecting the 
most important aspects of the reality as re-
gards specifi  c issues and time periods can reliable model- based policy recommenda-
tions be made.15
Finally, it is important to bear in mind the limited meaningfulness of DSGE models with regard to the issues considered here. The aim of macroprudential policy is to 
identify systemic risks at an early stage and, ideally, to avert them. However, the present class of DSGE models typically cannot cap-ture systemic risk; and the newly developed 
DSGE models which include systemic risk are still too abstract to be able to capture the interaction between monetary and 
macroprudential policy.16 The class of DSGE 
models dealt with here was developed to 
represent relatively small fl  uctuations of the 
model variables around a stable long- term 
equilibrium (“steady state”). This means that important features of fi  nancial crises 
– such as an abrupt drop in asset prices, fi  re sales of securities or runs on fi  nancial mar-
14 According to the Taylor principle, the infl  ation coef-
fi  cient in the monetary policy rule has to be greater 
than one in order to achieve a stable equilibrium. The 
more than proportional reaction by the nominal inter-est rate to changes in the infl  ation rate implies raising the real interest rate where shocks have a positive ef-
fect on the infl  ation rate and a decrease of the real 
interest rate where shocks have a negative  effect.
15 As E M Leeper and J M Nason (Bringing  Financial 
Stability into Monetary Policy, CAMA Working Paper 72/ 2014) emphasise, there is, generally speaking, no 
such thing as the “most important” fi  nancial frictions. Rather, the importance of the frictions varies over time and depends on the state of the economy.

from 1 to 3 and the parameter for output growth and for 
credit growth in the same rule from 0 to 3. In the macro-prudential rule, the parameter for credit growth is varied 
from 0 to 40. Given credit growth of 1%, a value of 40 
would be equivalent to an increase in the capital ratio by 2 percentage points. 1 Angelini et al (2004, op cit) use the same model framework as model A. However, in contrast 
to the study under consideration, they fi  nd a positive opti-
mal value of the credit growth coeffi   cient in the macropru-dential rule (here: 0). The analyses are not directly compar-
able with each other, however. Angelini et al ((2004), op 
cit) use an ad hoc loss function and rule out the possibility of a reaction to a fi  nancial market variable on the part of monetary policy.

cing the key problems in its area precisely and 
effectively.
In this perspective, monetary policy makes no 
meaningful contribution to the development of 
financial imbalances, such as through market 
players’ excessive risk appetite, which means 
that the risk- taking channel is viewed as insig -
nificant. The monetary policy rate is regarded 
as an ineffective tool for containing, far less 
avoiding risks to financial stability. Were mon -
etary policy responsible for price stability and 
financial stability at the same time, this would 
result in a conflict of objectives, and would cre -
ate the danger that safeguarding financial sta -
bility would undermine credibility regarding the 
objective of price stability.29
Extended perspective
Others regard the first perspective explained 
above as an ideal scenario that would practic -
ally never materialise in the real world.30 Al-though they, too, believe that monetary policy 
should fundamentally be geared to the rela -
tively narrowly defined objective of price stabil -
ity, they think that monetary policy should not 
focus – as was the case before the crisis – too 
narrowly on achieving a short- term inflation 
target,31 as that hinders monetary policy from 
combating longer- term financial imbalances 
(such as pronounced credit cycles), which 
would ultimately be at odds with price stability Idealised per-
spective largely rejects idea that monetary policy should address financial stability issuesExtended per-spective: monet -
ary policy should keep an eye on 
long- term threats  
to price stability caused by finan-cial imbalancesket institutions – can only be described to a 
limited extent.17 In this sense, the analyses 
presented here are to be considered as 
positive.18 Proceeding from the observation 
that macroprudential institutions were es-
tablished for very good reasons, the impli-
cations of this policy (or individual segments 
of it, such as capital requirements for banks) are examined with regard to the macroeco-
nomic effects and their interaction with 
monetary policy.19

over the medium to long term as well.32 Much 
as in the idealised perspective, the objective of 
financial stability should be achieved primarily 
by macroprudential policy, using macropruden -
tial tools. However, unlike the idealised per -
spective, the extended perspective assumes 
that it is impossible to eliminate an excessively 
pronounced financial cycle and thus risks to 
 financial stability with these tools alone.33
This represents a not- inconsiderable modifica -
tion for the conduct of monetary policy: it 
should not be focused, as before, exclusively 
on achieving a short- run inflation target but 
must now systemically incorporate the financial 
cycle into its decisions in order to safeguard 
price stability in the long run as well. A monet -
ary policy stance that is generally stricter during 
upswings, even in the absence of inflationary 
pressures, and is aggressively eased in the short 
term during marked downturns, but a less per -
sistent expansionary monetary policy stance 
following a period of economic downturn, 
would lead to a “more symmetrical” monetary 
policy design.34 Even if, in the short term, the 
monetary policy stance were to cause the tar -
get variables to differ from their desired values 
– especially from the objective of price stabil -
ity – this would justify the associated costs by 
avoiding future, yet larger deviations – such as 
in the form of a crisis.35 Although aggressive 
monetary policy action is proposed specifically 
for managing crises – that is, during the busi -
ness cycle downturn – the meat of crisis reso -
lution lies in “repairing” the balance sheets in 
the private sector, meaning, above all, eliminat -
ing the debt overhang. Monetary policy is re -
garded as being less suited to this task; instead, 
conducting a prolonged expansionary monet -
ary policy could bring to bear primarily the risks 
and side- effects of such measures.36
Even if recourse is taken to non- standard mon -
etary policy measures, monetary policy makers’ 
options for dealing with such a recession 
caused by overindebtedness are restricted.37 To 
that extent, they are also limited in their ability 
to create the conditions for a self- sustaining upswing – at least in the aftermath of severe 
financial crises. The extended perspective there -
fore stresses the danger of overloading monet -
ary policy in the context of severe financial cri -
ses. Its proponents therefore believe that it is 
appropriate to combat the financial excesses of 
a boom using monetary policy tools in order to 
avoid such overloading later on. The (prevent -
ive) contribution of monetary policy to ensur -
ing financial stability is therefore regarded as 
necessary in order to protect credibility regard -
ing the price stability objective.
In terms of monetary policy, financial stability is 
interpreted as an intermediate objective along 
the road to the ultimate objective of sustain -
able price stability,38 and therefore requires an 
extended policy horizon. The main reason this 
is necessary is that, in a typical case, the inter -
val between the build- up of a systemic risk and Monetary policy 
should take  financial stability into consider-ation in a sys-tematic manner and thus be more “symmet -
rical” than  before, …
… which also 
protects it from a futile battle against balance sheet recessionsFinancial stabil-
ity requires a 
longer- term 
 policy horizon
32 “The key concept is that of sustainable price stability.” 
See C Borio (2014), op cit, p 12.
33 Scepticism concerning the effectiveness of macropru -
dential policy is voiced in a variety of ways. The expressions 
and sources of this scepticism are manifold: risks to finan -
cial stability are difficult to measure; the analytical frame -
work for assessing transmission channels is underdevel -
oped; experience of the specific calibration of the instru -
ments is lacking; institutional and political-  economic con -
siderations need to be looked at; there are doubts as to 
whether all forms of financial frictions can even be ad -
dressed using macroprudential instruments. See C Borio

a crisis is considerably longer than the monet -
ary policy horizon resulting from the conven -
tional battle against inflation.39 The main point 
here is to weigh up the risks and not to mech -
anistically stretch out the forecast horizon.40 In 
upswing phases, this could counteract the 
build- up of financial imbalances and hence 
longer- term price instabilities.
In this perspective, monetary policy can contrib -
ute to the build- up of financial imbalances since 
the monetary policy stance generally impacts 
on the risk appetite of financial intermediaries, 
therefore affecting the stability of the financial 
sector and, by extension, the outlook for price 
stability. The monetary policy interest rate is ac -
cordingly regarded as effective in at least con -
taining risks to financial stability even though 
financial stability can only be ensured in con -
junction with macroprudential policy.41
Integrated perspective
Proponents of the third perspective argue that 
even the extended perspective calls for an ex -
cessively strict and inappropriate separation of 
the two policy areas. The aims of price stability 
and financial stability and the instruments and 
transmission mechanism of monetary policy and 
macroprudential policy, they hold, are so closely 
interwoven that monetary policy cannot focus 
on the narrow objective of price stability. For in -
stance, non- standard monetary policy measures 
such as securities purchase programmes not 
only have direct intended monetary policy ef -
fects but also, through “stealth recapitalisation” 
of ailing financial institutions, impact on finan -
cial stability, which in turn feeds back indirectly 
into price stability.42 Moreover, macroprudential 
measures affect lending (with the immediate 
objective of ensuring financial stability), which 
impacts on money creation and thus on price 
stability.43 The integrated view thus advocates 
using both macroprudential and monetary pol -
icy instruments (standard and non-  standard) in 
order to ensure financial stability – and, at the 
same time, price stability. Strictly speaking, it 
therefore does not make sense to classify the tools by target area but is even, if anything, 
counterproductive.44 Rather, both policy areas 
need to cooperate closely.
This perspective represents the most radical de -
parture from the pre- crisis consensus. Although 
its proponents also hold that establishing a 
macroprudential framework and making it as 
effective and credible as possible is the right 
path, achieving this objective should not be 
used to justify monetary policymakers’ fixation 
on price stability. Financial market events 
should always be part of monetary policy con -
siderations. Monetary policy instruments are 
held to be indispensable as means of contain -
ing or avoiding financial imbalances. If, despite 
the joint efforts of monetary policy and macro -
prudential policy, a crisis nevertheless does 
break out, a “bottleneck approach” should be 
taken, ie supporting those sectors that suffer 
most from a debt overhang and whose balance 
sheets were hit the hardest. Without such pol -
icy measures, the result could be liquidity spir -
als and “fire sales”, culminating in a self-  
reinforcing deflationary spiral.45Monetary policy

According to this view, monetary policy im -
pacts on the build- up of risks to financial stabil -
ity.46 Finally, the integrated perspective holds 
that, if policymakers are overly fixated on the 
goal of price stability, the danger of “financial 
dominance” arises following the outbreak of a 
severe financial crisis (see box on pages 65 to 
67).47 If monetary policy does not (preventively) 
make an adequate contribution to protecting 
financial stability, the potential result is that the 
fragility of the financial sector in a crisis could 
force monetary policy to be too loose in terms 
of price stability, as otherwise the continued 
existence of many financial institutions would 
be in doubt and thus additional adverse im -
pacts on economic developments could be ex -
pected. The intensive preventive contribution 
of monetary policy to ensuring financial stabil -
ity is regarded as necessary in order to protect 
credibility regarding the price stability objective.
Challenges involved in 
 making monetary policy 
more focused on financial 
stability
At present, there are still no signs of a consen -
sus or of a majority emerging in favour of one 
particular perspective. One contributory factor 
in this is that macroprudential policy is a rela -
tively new policy area. It would therefore be 
unrealistic to expect conclusive answers to al -
ready be available to the many issues that have 
been discussed to date.
The explanations above regarding the extended 
and integrated perspective contain a number of 
arguments in favour of a greater involvement of 
monetary policy in safeguarding financial stabil -
ity. In addition to these conceptual aspects, it 
could also be advantageous from an organisa -
tional perspective for monetary policy to play a 
role in addressing financial stability issues. This 
would sidestep the problems that exist with re -
gard to the flow of information and coordin -
ation between financial stability and price 
stability- oriented policy. Furthermore, by placing financial stability within the remit of monetary 
policy, responsibility for financial stability would 
lie with an independent institution, namely the 
central bank, which already has experience and 
expertise in the area of macroeconomic devel -
opments and financial markets.48
A greater involvement of monetary policy in 
safeguarding financial stability does, however, 
present a challenge for central banks for a 
number of reasons. First and foremost, our cur -
rent understanding of the interrelationships be -
tween the financial and the real economic sec -
tor is still limited. Moreover, the effectiveness 
of the monetary policy interest rate as an in -
strument in preventing financial stability risks is 
likely to be limited, especially in the euro area, 
not least owing to the lack of synchronicity of 
credit cycles in the single currency area. And 
even if these arguments are not taken into ac -
count, political- economic considerations, 
which ultimately affect the credibility of monet -
ary policy, and possibly also undesired eco -
nomic side- effects from gearing monetary pol -
icy more strongly towards financial stability, still 
present a challenge.Integrated per-

change in risk premiums (see J H Cochrane (2011), Presi -
dential Address: Discount Rates, Journal of Finance 66, 
pp  1047-1108). Various studies accordingly explain how 
monetary policy measures affect risk premiums. See R J

is also made to the “volatility paradox”, according to 
which, precisely in apparently tranquil times of low funda -
mental risk, systemic risk is built up – owing to, for in -
stance, excessive indebtedness – which then erupts in eco -
nomic crises. See also M K Brunnermeier and Y Sannikov

etary policy toolkit to stabilising the financial sector, run -
ning the risk of setbacks in its efforts to achieve the object -
ive of price stability.

“Financial do minance” as a potential problem 
for monetary policy
Given the overlap between the fi  elds of 
monetary policy and macroprudential pol-icy, the two policy areas’ measures may complement or, under certain circum-
stances, come into confl  ict with each other. Within a theoretical model framework, this 
box will illustrate possible interdependen-cies between the two policy areas, with 
particular focus on potentially destabilising 
developments in private debt.1 Notably, we 
will identify which confi  guration of the two policy measures enables a stable model so-
lution and therefore generally stable eco-
nomic development.2 To allow for a trans-
parent depiction of central mechanisms and 
the related results, it should be noted that 
the stylised model used here and the asso-ciated analysis are based on, in some cases, 
strong assumptions. This also means that the model’s output may not be directly transferable to the current economic situ-
ation, and caution is therefore advisable.
The analysis is based on a model framework 
similar to that of Benes and Kumhof (2011).3 
The credit market examined in this analysis is subject to frictions, as the success of pro-jects carried out by enterprises is uncertain at the time of borrowing, while the liability 
of these enterprises is limited in the event 
of default. Enterprises depend on credit fi  -
nancing for conducting investment pro-jects, which they receive from banks. The banks fi  nance loans using equity and de-posits acquired from households. Enter-prises are subject to the risk of not being able to meet their loan repayment obliga-
tions. Given the assumption that loan con-
tracts cannot be made contingent on the success of the enterprises’ projects, unex-pectedly high default rates are refl  ected 
negatively in the banks’ balance sheets.
The assumption of a complete deposit in-surance scheme, funded by tax revenues, 
means that deposits are risk- free for house-
holds. Therefore, compared with deposits, equity is the more expensive form of fund-
ing for fi  nancial intermediaries. This means 
that without regulatory intervention –  ie without regulatory capital requirements  – the model economy would be inherently unstable on account of its incentive struc-ture: the banks would seek to achieve full 
debt fi  nancing and could fund more or less 
any loan amount. In this economy, only 
macroprudential policy intervention lays the 
foundation for stable macroeconomic de-velopment. The macroprudential instru-ment employed is a binding bank capital 
requirement, ie banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their credit volume 
as equity.4 In addition, the model contains 
price rigidities and a monetary policy insti-
tution. This allows us to examine the inter-
play between the macroprudential policy 
described above and monetary policy.
The present model can be compared to a 
prototypical New Keynesian model without 
fi  nancial frictions. In this kind of standard 
model, the “Taylor principle” is a necessary and suffi   cient condition for the existence of 
a determinate, stable solution.5 The prin-
ciple states that monetary policymakers should raise their policy instrument (the nominal short- term interest rate) by more 
than 1 percentage point if the infl  ation rate 
rises by 1 percentage point. Intuitively, this 
means that, if monetary policymakers react 
1 Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) 
models are used to examine the transmission of shocks 
in an economy and to describe the impacts of policy 
decisions on economic agents (households, enterprises 
and banks).2 The present analysis relates to a specifi  c example of 
interaction and policy instruments; many other fric-
tions and instruments are conceivable.3 See J Benes and M Kumhof (2011), Risky Bank Lend-
ing and Optimal Capital Adequacy Regulation, IMF 
Working Paper WP/ 11/ 130.
4 Unlike with the Benes and Kumhof (2011) model, 
downward deviation from the minimum capital ratio is not possible here.5 See M Woodford (2001), The Taylor rule and optimal 
monetary policy, American Economic Review Papers 
and Proceedings, Vol 91, pp 232-237.Deutsche Bundesbank

strongly enough to infl  ation, the real inter-
est rate will increase in response to higher 
infl  ation (in technical terms, the coeffi   cient 
on infl  ation in the policy rule is greater than 
one). As a result, aggregate demand will 
fall, which will ultimately cause the infl  ation 
rate to contract. In this kind of standard 
model, monetary policymakers are thus able to stabilise infl  ation by following the 
Taylor principle.
However, the model framework used here 
takes into account fi  nancial market fric-tions, meaning that interest rate changes 
imply additional effects which, in turn, may 
impact on the stability of the economy. In 
this regard, it is particularly important that 
the loan contracts mentioned above are written in the form of nominal contracts. Consequently, an infl  ation rate rise in the present model leads to a reduction in the 
real debt burden if the nominal lending rate remains unchanged. Taken in isolation, this 
has a stabilising effect on corporate debt. Generally speaking, both monetary policy and macroprudential policy can therefore 
have an effect on debt dynamics under the 
present model framework. For example, macroprudential policy is able to use a higher bank capital ratio to curb lending, while monetary policy can lower the debt 
burden by allowing for infl  ation. Conversely, there is also a possibility in this scenario of a monetary policy based on the Taylor prin-
ciple having a destabilising effect if, given high debt levels, very low infl  ation causes the real debt level to rise further (Fisher’s 
“debt- defl  ation theory”).
Such a situation can arise, in particular, if 
banks are not required to maintain a suffi   -
cient capital buffer during a boom and, as a result, issue too many loans to enterprises, 
which may lead lending down an unstable 
path. In the context of the present model, 
this means that macroprudential policy does not respond or does not respond 
strongly enough to debt, allowing lending 
to strengthen and ultimately pressuring 
monetary policymakers to stabilise the real 
debt burden by raising infl  ation (otherwise 
there would be no stable equilibrium in the present model). In other words, to keep the debt level sustainable, infl  ation is generated by a violation of the Taylor principle.
6 Mon-
etary policy then fi  nds itself in a situation 
that can be described as “fi  nancial domin-
ance”.
A simulation study can be used to illustrate 
the concept of fi  nancial dominance. This in-volves examining a range of parameter val-
ues for both the monetary policy rule and 
the macroprudential rule. These parameter 
values refl  ect the sensitivity of the policy to 
indicator variables and therefore to certain 
economic developments. The monetary 
policy rule is expressed as follows:
,
where Rt is the short- term nominal interest 
rate and Πt is the infl  ation rate. Variables 
without the subscript t  denote variables in 
long- term equilibrium. The coeffi   cient τΠ 
6 Similarly, the term “fi  scal dominance” was already 
coined by Leeper (1991, Equilibria under Active and 
Passive Monetary and Fiscal Policies, Journal of Monet-
ary Economics, Vol 27, Issue 1, pp 129-147) when he 
showed that monetary policymakers can be forced to 
pursue a policy which violates the Taylor principle 
when fi  scal policy is unsustainable.Determinacy regions of the model as a

represents the policy instrument’s sensitivity 
to infl  ation. The macroprudential rule is 
given by the following formula:
,
where /uni03D5t represents the bank capital ratio 
and bt designates lending; the coeffi   cient ζb 
controls the macroprudential instrument’s 
sensitivity to private debt.
The result of the analysis is presented in the 
chart on page 66. The horizontal axis shows 
the coeffi   cient of the macroprudential rule 
(ζb), while the vertical axis represents the 
coeffi   cient of the monetary policy rule (τΠ).7 
The chart is divided into four quadrants, two of which refl  ect parameter combin-
ations that lead to a determinate, stable so-lution and therefore to generally stable eco-
nomic development. These are the blue shaded areas in the bottom left and top 
right quadrants. As long as the coeffi   cients 
of the policy rules are either both low or 
both high, a determinate and stable model solution exists. In the fi  rst scenario, follow-ing Leeper (1991), macroprudential policy is described as active and monetary policy as 
passive, whereas in the second scenario, monetary policy is characterised as active 
and macroprudential policy as passive.
What is the intuition behind this classifi  ca-
tion? If, for example, macroprudential policy 
is active, ie ζb is (too) low, the capital re-
quirements for banks are comparatively 
low, which leads to excessive lending. The 
economy is in a state of fi  nancial domin-
ance, as the burden of stabilising the debt 
level is ultimately imposed on monetary 
policy. A determinate, stable solution is pre-
sented in the bottom left quadrant. As macroprudential regulation does not suffi   -ciently stabilise the debt level, monetary 
policy is forced into the passive policy cat-
egory. More specifi  cally, this means that, in 
order to arrive at a stable equilibrium, the central bank responds to infl  ation rate 
changes with a less than one- to- one change in the interest rate. As a result, the violation of the Taylor principle refl  ects the fact that 
monetary policy gives priority to fi  nancial 
stability: it uses infl  ation to stabilise debt.
In the top left quadrant, however, monetary 
policy follows the Taylor principle: the coef-fi  cient in the policy rule is greater than one, 
τΠ > 1. However, macroprudential policy 
does not respond strongly enough to debt 
in this quadrant either. This results in an un-
sustainable level of debt, and an explosive 
solution shows up in this quadrant of the 
model.
Provided the central bank continues to fol-
low the Taylor principle, these results show 
that, within the model framework pre-sented, macroprudential policy also needs 
to respond strongly enough to debt in order 
to ensure stable macroeconomic growth. 
Otherwise, in our analytical framework, an 
equilibrium would be reached only in situ-
ations of fi  nancial dominance. (Ultimately, 
the model analysis only presents the impli-
cations of certain policy circumstances. Any 
strategic action taken by the parties con-
cerned is not modelled.) As a result, monet-
ary policymakers would be forced to allow 
more infl  ation than if fi  nancial stability were irrelevant.
As specifi  c assumptions apply to the model 
used here, the applicability of the mechan-
isms and results to the current economic 
situation is limited. Nevertheless, the analy-sis shows that it is important to continue to 
work intensively on establishing the most effective macroprudential policy possible, 
so that monetary policy can focus on its pri-mary objective of price stability.

prudential rule ζb differs from the regulatory capital 
ratio /uni03D5t.Deutsche Bundesbank

Risks to credibility resulting 
from a financial stability- 
oriented monetary policy
The credibility of a central bank is of paramount 
importance. It plays a crucial role in steering 
expectations and thus in determining the ef -
fectiveness of monetary policy.49 It must there -
fore be ensured that strengthening the role of 
monetary policy in financial stability issues does 
not jeopardise its credibility. Credibility could be 
affected in a number of ways.
First, the integration of monetary policy in 
 financial stability issues harbours the risk (at 
least temporarily) of additional conflicting ob -
jectives (see also the box on welfare-theoretical 
thoughts on pages 45 to 48). Monetary policy 
could, for example, be faced with a situation 
where the objective of ensuring price stability 
requires a more relaxed (or a tighter) monetary 
policy stance, whereas the objective of safe -
guarding financial stability requires a tighter (or 
a more relaxed) stance. This would necessitate 
a deviation, at least temporarily, from one or 
both of the two objectives. Although monetary 
policy is already familiar with the problem of 
conflicting objectives brought about, for ex -
ample, by supply shocks, which influence the 
outlook for prices and the economy in different 
directions in the short term, the communicative 
demands resulting from a greater integration 
of financial stability issues are likely to increase 
further. If the central bank does not succeed in 
communicating that a possible deviation from 
an objective does not imply that this objective 
is being “watered down” or abandoned, but is 
merely the outcome of a trade- off decision re -
sulting from a temporary conflict of objectives, 
this could undermine the credibility of monet -
ary policy.50 This would  result in a less effective 
monetary policy.
Second, the objective of ensuring financial sta -
bility could give rise to a time- inconsistency 
problem for monetary policy.51 If monetary pol -
icy is responsible for both price stability and fi -
nancial stability and if the latter is influenced by private- sector debt, for instance, it may initially 
be desirable for monetary policy to pursue a 
low inflation rate. However, following the 
onset of a  financial shock, which gives rise to a 
high level of private- sector debt, for example, 
monetary policymakers could, under certain 
conditions, decide to reduce the real debt bur -
den further down the line by allowing a higher 
rate of inflation.52 It is therefore essential that 
monetary policy continues to fulfil its obligation 
of maintaining price stability.
Third, monetary policy’s independence could be 
jeopardised if it focuses too heavily on financial 
stability issues. The independence of monetary 
policy is, however, a fundamental institutional 
prerequisite for ensuring its credibility.53 Gearing 
monetary policy solely towards the goal of price 
stability facilitates the political acceptance of 
central bank independence as the inflation tar -
get and the associated instrument, the short-  
term interest rate, can be clearly defined and 
assessed.54 This is not the case for the objective 
of financial stability, however. On the contrary, Strengthening

51 The general problem is that a policy which is deemed to 
be optimal and is announced as such at a certain point in 
time is no longer optimal at a later point in time once the 
private economic agents have adjusted to the announce -
ment and thus the policy is no longer implemented. For a 
classic definition of the time- inconsistency problem,

several variables are taken into consideration in 
this case (credit growth, asset prices, debt etc) 
the desired levels of which are a priori  not de -
termined; moreover, their attainment is difficult 
to assess and they cannot be associated mech -
anistically with the objective of financial stabil -
ity.55 In addition, by having to get involved in 
any solvency issues of private economic agents 
or other countries whilst trying to achieve its 
objective of financial stability, monetary policy 
moves closer to the domain of quasi- fiscal activ -
ities.56 This inevitably raises the question as to 
the democratic legitimacy of monetary policy, 
as it is exercising fiscal tasks that are reserved 
for elected representatives. These aspects could 
generate political pressure which could under -
mine the independence and thus the credibility 
of the central bank with regard to its objective 
of ensuring price stability.
From a monetary policy perspective, it has to 
be ensured that the risks to credibility set out 
here, which result from a greater integration of 
monetary policy in financial stability issues, do 
not materialise. Conflicting objectives can be 
explained by means of careful communication 
and can thus be rendered manageable, as is 
already common practice in the core area of 
monetary policy in the event of supply shocks, 
for instance. The problem of time inconsistency 
has to be avoided by way of institutional ar -
rangements, so that monetary policy sticks to 
its past announcements. Monetary policy inde -
pendence can be protected by refraining from 
defining financial stability as a monetary policy 
objective in its own right.
Undesired side- effects of a 
 financial stability- oriented 
monetary policy
The calls for a more symmetrically designed 
monetary policy with regard to credit cycles are 
the subject of much debate, even after the ex -
perience of the financial crisis. The view is 
sometimes taken that the costs of a greater in -
tegration of monetary policy in financial stabil -ity issues, especially in the form of a tighter 
stance than would actually be necessary to 
achieve the objective of price stability within a 
given policy horizon (sometimes referred to as 
a “leaning against the wind” (LATW) policy), 
would outweigh the benefits.57,58
Furthermore, a policy of this kind is criticised as 
it cannot necessarily be assumed a priori  that it 
will always achieve its desired effect. In actual 
fact, it cannot be categorically ruled out, for 
example, that a LATW strategy will increase 
households’ real debt burden instead of redu -
cing it as intended (this can occur, for instance, 
if nominal debt reacts more sluggishly to an in -
crease in interest rates than the price level or 
disposable income). A LATW policy could prove 
to be problematic, at least for some sectors 
(such as those that are characterised by a com -
paratively high level of debt).59
These objections do not imply per se  that LATW 
cannot make a contribution towards stabilising 
the financial sector as a whole. In this respect, 
they by no means justify the categorical refusal 
of a LATW policy. They do, however, illustrate 
that a greater integration of monetary policy in 
ensuring financial stability can be associated It must be 
 ensured that the 
risks to credibility  
do not 
 materialise
A greater inte-
gration of mon-
etary policy in  financial stability issues could also 
entail economic 
costs …… and it is not 
a priori clear 
whether a policy 
of this kind  always achieves its desired 
 effect, …
… which, how-
ever, does not justify the cat -
egorical refusal of such a policy

57 It was recently argued taking model simulations for 
Sweden as an example that a LATW strategy would result 
in a distinctly higher unemployment rate without the likeli -
hood of future crises being notably reduced. See L Svensson

58 Doubts as to the costs of a LATW policy outweighing 
the benefits can be indirectly seen in a recently published 
statement by the Federal Reserve. In this statement, mon -
etary policy is rated as the final instrument that should be 
used to safeguard financial stability if macroprudential 
measures in the stricter sense fail to achieve the desired 
effect. See L Brainard, The Federal Reserve’s Financial Sta -
bility Agenda, speech held on 3 December 2014.

with economic costs (see also the box on 
welfare-theoretical thoughts on pages  45 to 
48).
It is also possible under certain circumstances 
that the risk- taking channel points in the “op -
posite” direction (second order risk shifting ef -
fect).60 A monetary policy tightening could, for 
example, increase the likelihood of individual 
financial market players defaulting owing to a 
rise in financing costs and incite them to take 
greater risks in order to achieve higher (ex -
pected) yields.61 As a general rule, the empirical 
literature on risk- taking does, however, empha -
sise the fact that the secondary effect pre -
sented here is dominated by the first order ef -
fect. An increase in interest rates is therefore 
generally associated with a reduction in the in -
centive to take risks (see the box on risk pro -
pensity on pages 50 to 54).
The objections cited here illustrate that a 
greater integration of monetary policy in safe -
guarding financial stability can by all means en -
tail costs for the real economy. These costs, 
which can be interpreted as an insurance pre -

turing such a policy to prevent them from out -
weighing the benefits of having a more resili -
ent financial system. These objections do not 
justify a categorical rejection of a greater in -
volvement of monetary policy in safeguarding 
financial stability per se ; they do, however, il -
lustrate that a greater integration of monetary 
policy in financial stability issues needs to be 
considered along with other factors and thus 
ultimately brings about new challenges.
Assessment and outlook
In the period prior to the global financial crisis, 
debate concerning the relationship between 
monetary policy and financial stability was 
largely restricted to the question of whether it 
is advantageous to use the policy rate to burst 
financial market bubbles at an early stage. 
However, experience gained in the wake of the crisis have led to a shift and an expansion in 
the focus of the debate. The debate surround -
ing the role of financial stability is now no 
longer concentrated primarily on interest rate 
policy but on macroprudential policy. That 
being said, the issue as to whether monetary 
policy should play a greater role than to date in 
safeguarding financial stability is still controver -
sial. The interdependencies between monetary 
and macroprudential policy play a significant 
role in this debate. Owing to the lack of experi -
ence in this area, there is a considerable need 
for further analyses of the impact of monetary 
policy on financial stability and of the effective -
ness of macroprudential policy. An initial as -
sessment can nevertheless be made on the 
basis of current debates and research findings.
There is a broad consensus that a new policy 
area with its own set of tools is indispensable in 
order to safeguard financial stability. The tools 
of monetary policy alone are too undifferenti -
ated to do justice to the complexity of the task 
of ensuring financial stability. This is why it re -
mains a top priority to establish and strengthen 
the effectiveness of macroprudential policy.62 
Macroprudential policy would then be in a pos -
ition to create the framework conditions for a 
stability- oriented monetary policy by setting 
the right incentives and ensuring sufficient re -
silience in the financial sector. In particular, it is 
important to ensure that monetary policy does 
not fall into the “financial dominance” trap. 
Conversely, a monetary policy which has the The secondary

61 An example based on a US financial institution (New 
Century Financial Corporation) shows that this institution 
adjusted its business model following a series of interest 
rate rises by, inter alia, loosening its credit standards and 
shifting the focus of its business operations, also geograph -
ically. This resulted in an increase in loan portfolio risk. See

primary objective of ensuring price stability can 
make use of the tools at its disposal to establish 
important preconditions for stable financial 
markets.
Macroprudential policy should be employed in 
a targeted manner and should not be reinter -
preted as a national instrument for managing 
demand,63 as this is ultimately the responsibility 
of other policy areas. Economic policy chal -
lenges which result from the heterogeneous 
nature of the euro area should not be tackled 
using macroprudential instruments unless these 
are directly linked to financial stability. Macro -
prudential policy should therefore be strictly 
geared towards financial stability.
A monetary policy which focuses on price sta -
bility in the medium term is unable to prevent 
the occurrence of undesirable developments in 
the financial markets, which could spill over to 
the real economy and thus jeopardise price sta -
bility. The recent past has shown that the mon -
etary policy stance can influence, in particular, 
financial market players’ propensity to take 
risks. Monetary policymakers should therefore 
also consider the effect of their decisions on 
the stability of the financial system as a whole. 
This suggests a symmetrical monetary policy 
stance over the financial cycle – in other words, 
a monetary policy stance that tends to be 
stricter in upswings, even in the absence of in -
flationary pressure, and is aggressively eased 
during a marked downturn, but a less persist -
ent expansionary policy stance following a 
period of economic downturn – and thus a 
trade- off between medium and longer- term 
risks to price stability.64 A symmetrical monet -
ary policy along those lines should help to 
avoid a situation in which financial market par -
ticipants take on too much risk.An alternative or complementary argument in 
favour of more symmetry could result from an 
objective function of monetary policy which 
explicitly takes account of financial stability (see 
the box on page  45). The political- economic 
reasons mentioned in the text and, in particu -
lar, the limits of the monetary policy instru -
ments do, however, give the impression that an 
expansion of the list of objectives is not expedi -
ent. If financial stability were to be adopted as 
an additional, separate monetary policy object -
ive, it would also harbour the risk of raising un -
realistic expectations regarding the effective -
ness of the monetary policy instruments.
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy, 
which could be placed somewhere between the 
idealised and the extended perspective, is suffi -
ciently flexible to provide a targeted response to 
future challenges. A fundamental change in 
strategy is not required. Nevertheless, given the 
limited experience with and knowledge of the 
functioning of macroprudential instruments as 
well as their interaction with monetary policy, 
the Eurosystem should further develop the rele -
vant analytical framework. This is, in principle, 
already contained in the monetary pillar of the 
Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy.
Further work needs to be done in terms of im -
plementing an effective macroprudential pol -
icy. This would not only improve the stability of 
the financial system as a whole but also create 
the conditions in which the single monetary 
policy is able to ensure price stability in accord -
ance with its mandate.Monetary policy

German balance of payments in 2014
The German economy’s current account surplus expanded very strongly in 2014 to reach a new 
post- war- high of 7½% of GDP. This was driven by a significantly increased surplus in the trade 
account. The average net surplus from cross- border investment income over the past two years 
was below the high amounts recorded in 2011 and 2012. Although Germany’s net external pos -
ition continued to rise, the positive effect of this on the investment income sub- account was more 
than offset by the further decline in the average interest rate and the narrowing yield spread on 
the assets side.
Following a stagnant outcome in 2013, export sales by German enterprises picked up noticeably 
again in 2014. Given the relatively subdued level of global economic activity, this can be attrib -
uted to regional and product range effects. Countries experiencing comparatively strong eco -
nomic growth such as the United States, the United Kingdom and China displayed a markedly 
higher demand for German- made automobile products as well as for pharmaceuticals and, to a 
degree, machinery and equipment. The trade surplus was additionally boosted by substantial 
terms-of-trade effects. These resulted during the period under review from the lower cost of 
imported commodities, especially the plummeting crude oil price towards the end of the year. In 
real terms, the volume of imported goods increased faster than exports on the back of buoyant 
domestic economic activity. When making a macroeconomic assessment, it is important to bear 
in mind that the higher German current account surplus in 2014 was largely generated by exogen -
ous developments in the external setting.
The increase in the current account surplus was accompanied by a marked rise in Germany’s 
financial account surplus, thanks largely to higher net capital exports from direct investment. 
These outflows were chiefly fuelled by German firms’ higher direct investment abroad, whereas 
foreign enterprises only marginally expanded their presence in Germany. Portfolio investment was 
heavily influenced in 2014 by the abundant liquidity provided by the Eurosystem and expectations 
of large- scale asset purchases for monetary policy purposes (quantitative easing). This constella -
tion was reflected by sharply declining yields in Germany, continued high demand from domestic 
investors for foreign securities, and comparatively weak demand from abroad for German debt 
securities. In the other investment sub- account, cross- border flows of capital broadly offset one 
another. In this context, the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims decreased slightly on balance last 
year. Cross- border cash transactions were recorded in the balance of payments for the first time; 
recent estimates make it possible to gauge figures retrospectively for the period since 2002, when 
euro banknotes and coins were introduced.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends  
in the current account
In 2014, Germany’s current account balance 
climbed strongly by €37½ billion to almost 
€220 billion. At 7½% of gross domestic prod -
uct (GDP), this figure represents a new record 
post-  war high for Germany both in absolute 
and percentage terms, topping the previous 
peak of 2012 by ¾ percentage point. Statistic -
ally, more than half of this increase in the cur -
rent account surplus was accounted for by the 
further marked increase in the trade surplus. According to provisional information, net rev -
enue from cross- border investment income 
–  which has developed into an additional 
strong current account earner over the past 
decade – again lifted the overall surplus during 
the reporting period after having contracted 
discernibly in 2013. However, the two- year in -
vestment income total over 2013 and 2014 fell 
short of the high figure achieved in 2011 and 
2012. The traditionally large deficits on services 
(including travel) and in the secondary income 
balance narrowed perceptibly.1
In 2014, the current account surplus again 
clearly exceeded the stipulated upper threshold 
of 6% of GDP up to which positive balances 
are generally deemed unproblematic under the 
EU macroeconomic imbalances procedure 
(MIP), after coming close to the defined ceiling 
in 2013 (6½%). The European Commission 
considers Germany’s persistently high current 
account surplus, along with the low level of in -
vestment spending, to be the main indications 
of a macroeconomic imbalance in Germany. 
Having found the economic policy response to 
be inadequate, the Commission sharpened its 
overall criticism in its 2015 appraisal, stating 
that there was a need for intensified monitor -
ing and decisive policy action to address Ger -
many’s macroeconomic imbalances (see also 
the box on page 75).
The very steep rise in the current account sur -
plus in 2014 highlights the major impact that 
substantial changes in the global environment 
have on Germany’s external account. German 
exports are currently being boosted not so 
much by the broad dynamics of global eco -
nomic activity as by regional and product-  Current account

 European Commission steps up the macroeconomic 
 imbalance procedure for Germany
The European Commission has stepped up 
the macroeconomic imbalance procedure 
for Germany. On 26  February 2015, the 
Commission published an assessment1 stat-
ing that there has been no tangible im-
provement in the trends of imbalances 
identifi  ed previously and that the policy re-
sponse has been insuffi   cient so far. Ger-
many is now no longer in the second but in 
the third of the six macroeconomic imbal-
ance procedure categories. The German 
economy is thus considered to have macro-
economic imbalances which require moni-
toring and decisive policy action.
In its 2015 in- depth review,2 the Commis-
sion believes that the German economy’s 
current account surplus, which it projects to 
increase to 8% of gross domestic product in 2015, is still the main indication that macro-
economic imbalances exist in Germany. In 
addition to the currently substantial terms- 
of-trade gains, this surplus is thought to be 
a result of the domestic export industry’s strong competitiveness and of high rev-
enues from investment abroad but also to 
refl  ect the fact that this has not been offset 
by increased domestic demand. While pri-vate consumption has increased, invest-ment is still considered to be disappoint-
ingly low. This is the second point that the Commission identifi  es as being a key indica-
tor of macroeconomic imbalances. It cites 
consistently weak investment in machinery 
and equipment, a loss of momentum in 
residential investment and insuffi   cient pub-
lic investment as specifi  c factors dragging 
on growth.
The Commission believes that Germany’s macroeconomic imbalances harbour sys-temic risks for the euro area. While euro- area partners benefi  t from Germany’s suc-
cess in trade, the weak domestic invest-
ment, falling potential growth and depend-
ence on external conditions pose risks to both Germany and the euro area. At the 
same time, the Commission acknowledges 
that Germany’s current account surplus in 
relation to its euro- area partners has fallen 
to less than a quarter of the total surplus, 
indicating an on- going rebalancing process 
in the euro area. The Commission believes 
that Germany can make a key contribution to reducing imbalances in the euro area by 
using its considerable total savings over-
hang for much- needed investment in mod-ernising and developing its infrastructure.
A further reason for the Commission to step 
up the macroeconomic imbalance proced-
ure is that it believes Germany, overall, has 
not suffi   ciently addressed the 2014 country- 
specifi  c recommendations. Germany has 
made limited progress in pursuing growth- 
friendly fi  scal policy whilst preserving a 
sound fi  scal position, in reducing disincen-
tives in the labour market (especially with 
regard to second earners) and in improving 
competition in the services sector. On the 
other hand, the Commission acknowledges 
that Germany has made some progress in keeping the overall costs of transforming 
the energy sector to a minimum.

specific demand trends. In tandem with plum -
meting oil prices, this caused the foreign trade 
balance to surge and inter alia obscured the 
fact that domestic demand in Germany picked 
up perceptibly in 2014. This, coupled with a 
similar surge in German industry’s demand for 
intermediate goods, generated strong real im -
port growth. Indeed, the European Commis -
sion itself expects domestic demand to con -
tinue to climb both in 2015 and 2016. This is 
another reason why there is currently no need 
to implement short- term stimulus measures in 
Germany. Instead, the emphasis should be on 
improving the longer-  term growth outlook. 
This should include reviewing whether the pre -vailing institutional framework has contributed 
to Germany’s aggregate savings overhang and 
to what extent remedial measures may be re -
quired.
For some years now, the very high overall sur -
pluses recorded in the German trade and cur -
rent balances have obscured the fact that the 
surpluses on trade in goods and services with 
other euro- area countries have narrowed con -
siderably compared with their peak level of 
2007. During the reporting period, both bal -
ances widened somewhat compared with 
2013. However, this is not surprising given that 
economic output in several of the countries 
worst hit by the crisis is now improving from a 
low base level. German enterprises remain well 
positioned in European markets. The slightly 
elevated wage and price trend evident in Ger -
many has thus far only resulted in a moderate 
adjustment of the country’s price competitive -
ness. The adjustment processes usual within a 
currency union are still ongoing. Nevertheless, 
the share of the current account balance that is 
statistically attributable to transactions within 
the euro area (1¾% of GDP) already no longer 
signals a major imbalance.
By contrast, at 5¾% of GDP , Germany’s current 
account surplus vis- à- vis non- euro- area coun -
tries has now reached a sizeable level. The fig -
ure has more than doubled compared with 
2007. Expanding foreign trade surpluses in the 
years that followed the great recession were 
instrumental in building up the high surplus 
position. In the context of a strongly rebound -
ing global economy, exports played a key role 
in this build- up between 2010 and 2012. In the 
past two years, given the comparatively mod -
est pace of growth in the world economy it 
was primarily the substantial terms- of- trade 
gains that further boosted the foreign trade 
balance. The recent depreciation of the euro is 
unlikely to have had much impact on exports 
during the period under review. The euro’s 
lower external value, as a factor tending to fos -
ter export opportunities to non- euro-  area 
countries, should be viewed per se  as an upside No narrowing

risk for the foreign trade surplus, not least in 
the near future.
Goods flows and balance 
of trade
German foreign trade picked up noticeably in 
2014. On an annual average, nominal exports 
of goods were 3¾% up on 2013, when they 
declined slightly (-¼%). Although goods im -
ports recorded a nominal rise of just 2% fol -
lowing a ¾% drop in 2013, price effects had a 
strong dampening impact due to the in some 
cases substantial falls in global commodity 
prices. In real terms the volume of goods im -
ported by Germany went up by an estimated 
4¼%. The upshot was that the foreign trade 
surplus expanded by €22 billion to reach a new 
record high of €217 billion. This lies well above 
the previous peak figure of €195 billion which 
was reached in 2007. Statistically, more than 
three- quarters of the increase during the re -
porting period arose from the marked improve -
ment in the terms of trade, whereas less than 
one- quarter was generated by the higher net 
export volume. Terms- of- trade effects therefore 
played a significant role for a second consecu -
tive year.
EU member states made a comparatively large 
contribution to German export growth in 2014, 
with sales of goods to non- euro- area EU coun -
tries recording a particularly sharp increase. 
Thus exports to the United Kingdom as well as 
to central and east European EU countries out -
side the euro area rose by more than one-  
tenth. Exports to the euro area also rebounded 
considerably (+2¾%). After two years of de -
clining exports, this reflects the incipient eco -
nomic recovery in the countries hardest hit by 
the crisis. In addition, the demand for German- 
made goods also picked up in France and Italy 
after slackening in 2013. Exports to the Nether -
lands went up again during the reporting 
period. By contrast, the value of goods im -
ported from Germany by other neighbouring 
countries such as Austria and Belgium once again fell short of the level recorded in 2011, 
which was the peak year in the current busi -
ness cycle.
Exports to countries outside the EU saw a mod -
erate increase in 2014 (1½%). The result was 
certainly influenced by the fact that exports to 
Russia contracted by almost one- fifth on ac -
count of the perceptible economic downturn in 
that country and externally imposed sanctions. 
On the other hand, exports to the United States 
and China, which along with the United King -
dom2 are the main partners in German indus -
try’s business dealings with non- euro- area 
countries, increased by one- tenth on average.

economies remained broadly unchanged in 
2014. For the second year in a row, exports to 
Japan struggled to match the greatly elevated 
volume achieved in 2012. Similarly, German for -
eign trade once again received no positive im -
petus from Switzerland.
In 2014, export earnings were up on the year in 
all the major categories of goods. There was an 
especially pronounced increase in exports of 
consumer goods, sales of which by German ex -
porters had already risen robustly in previous 
years. Pharmaceutical products played a key 
role in this. After dipping in 2013, exports of 
capital goods likewise jumped by a significant 
margin, with particularly marked growth in 
sales of motor vehicles to important markets 
such as China and the United Kingdom. Ex -
ports of motor vehicles to other euro- area 
countries also expanded for the first time since 
2011. This was accompanied by a perceptible 
increase in sales of computer, electronic and 
optical products. By contrast, the rise in exports 
of machinery was below average, although US 
business grew considerably.
The perceptible broad- based expansion in Ger -
man output was reflected in a pronounced in -
crease in real imports of goods. Imports of con -
sumer goods grew considerably in a buoyant 
consumer environment, with domestic demand 
for pharmaceutical products being especially 
prominent. Given the German economy’s close 
integration into the international division of 
 labour3, rising output, particularly in the indus -
trial sector, served to push up imports of inter -
mediate goods. After stalling in 2013, imports 
of motor vehicles recorded very sharp growth 
in 2014. This was accompanied by a less 
marked but still discernible increase in imports 
of machinery; this is consistent with the fact 
that investment in machinery and equipment 
during the reporting period was up from its de -
pressed level in 2012 and 2013. Energy imports Higher export

fell sharply in nominal and also in real terms. 
One reason for this was the reduced demand 
for heating fuel on account of the very mild 
winter weather at the beginning of the year.
Countries within and outside the euro area 
benefited similarly from the German economy’s 
upturn in import demand in real terms. The 
nominally smaller increase in imports from non- 
euro- area countries was due inter alia  to the 
higher share of energy imports attributable to 
this group of countries. The fall in energy prices 
clearly affected the trade result with major en -
ergy exporters such as Russia and the OPEC 
member countries, whose deliveries to Ger -
many shrank by 7% and as much as one-  
quarter respectively in nominal terms. German 
imports from the United States, the United 
Kingdom and Japan remained sluggish. By con -
trast, imports from the newly industrialised 
Asian countries and the south and east Asian 
emerging market economies rose considerably 
following two rather lacklustre years. In 2014, 
Chinese suppliers likewise largely recouped the 
losses in sales to the German market they had 
sustained over the preceding two years. The 
upturn in industrial activity, spearheaded by car 
production, boosted imports from central and 
east European countries in connection with the 
established component supply chain.The foreign trade sub- account does not, how -
ever, directly reflect the overall contribution to 
the current account made by trade in goods. 
This is because the foreign trade methodology 
captures goods flows once they physically cross 
a border and measures their value at Germa -
ny’s border, whereas trade in goods as re -
corded in the balance of payments is essentially 
based on change in ownership.4 As the suppli -
er’s border is uniformly taken as the place of 
performance for exports and imports alike, 
goods imports give rise to a valuation differ -
ence compared with the foreign trade figures. 
Statistically, import cif costs5 accounted for €22 
billion of the difference between the figures for 
trade in goods and foreign trade during the re -
porting period. These costs have no bearing on 
the current account balance, however, if trans -
portation is performed by foreign freight car -
riers, in which case they are recorded as ex -
penses under the services account. In 2014, 
these amounted to €17 billion.

net merchanting earnings that are generated 
whenever domestic enterprises buy goods 
abroad and resell these without importing 
them to Germany. The volume of such transac -
tions has increased sharply in recent years, with 
the automotive industry showing a particular 
preference for this form of international div -
ision of labour. In 2014, this generated a net 
positive contribution of €20½ billion to trade in 
goods. After factoring in other additions and 
subtractions such as goods flows related to 
cross-  border commission processing, the 2014 
balance from trade in goods shows a surplus of 
€229½ billion, compared with €207½ billion 
one year earlier.
Breakdown of invisibles
The deficit on cross- border services totalled 
€39 billion in 2014, which was €5½ billion less 
than in 2013. This improvement was caused 
mainly by a jump in receipts from services re -
lated to the production and distribution of 
goods, while expenditure on such services ren -
dered by non- residents contracted.
In recent years, the transport services sub-  
account has increasingly posted a deficit; in the 
year under review, this deficit grew by €1 bil -
lion to €13 billion. International trade in com -
puter, telecommunications and information 
services, which have ballooned over the past 
decade, posted a surplus of €2½ billion in 
2014, whereas in the past receipts from and 
expenditure on such services largely cancelled 
out. A significantly lower deficit was posted by 
professional and management consultancy ser -
vices, which include commercial services that 
traditionally show a deficit. The negative bal -
ance of maintenance and repair services nar -
rowed in 2014 as a combined result of higher 
revenue and lower expenditure. Such expend -
iture, which was reported mainly by German 
car manufacturers – presumably in connection 
with warranties – fell by more than €2 billion6 
in 2014. Foreign firms spent more on the cross- 
border licensing of intellectual property than did their German counterparts (€+4½ billion). 
While one- third of revenue in this sector now 
comes from emerging market economies and 
developing countries, up to now German firms 
have resorted almost exclusively to using intel -
lectual property products registered in industri -
alised countries. Cross- border research and de -
velopment services generate a stable surplus 
for Germany; in 2014, this amounted to +€3½ 
billion, the bulk of which was again attribut -
able to the United States.
German residents’ expenditure on foreign 
travel in 2014 amounted to €69½ billion, up by 
more than 1% on 2013. In keeping with the 
strong consumer demand, spending on private 
travel increased further by 1¼%, after already 
recording marked growth between 2011 and 
2013. Conversely, foreign travel for business 
purposes fell well below the previous year’s fig -
ure (-2%). The travel sub- account recorded re -
ceipts of €32½ billion, up by 5%, while the 
overall deficit shrank by €1 billion in 2014 to 
€37 billion.
Germany accumulated a surplus of €67 billion 
from cross- border primary income in 2014. The 
year- on- year increase of €6½ billion fully offset 
the decline seen in 2013. Since provisional data 
are prone to revision, the sharp rise at the cur -
rent end should not be overinterpreted. That 
said, one finding that should prove statistically 
robust is that the surplus for the past two years 
is significantly smaller than that reported for 
the previous two- year period. The primary in -
come balance is largely determined by the vol -
ume of income flowing to residents from their 
investments abroad and the amount German 
debtors transfer to other countries. In recent 
years the investment income account has made 
a major positive contribution to the current 
 account balance. This was due in part to the … with rising

 Effects on the cross- border investment income balance: 
asset accumulation, portfolio shifts and changes in yields
The balance of cross- border investment in-
come stood at €65 billion (or 2¼% of GDP) in 
2014, making it the second- largest asset item 
in the German current account after the goods trade surplus. Just ten years ago, in-
vestment income and spending were roughly equal. Germany’s investment income fl  ows to and from the rest of the world result from the 
amount and composition of external assets 
and liabilities as well as the income yields paid 
on assets and liabilities. The growth in Ger-
many’s investment income surplus is primarily thought to be linked to the considerable rise 
in net external assets. However, an analysis that disaggregates asset classes additionally reveals many different effects which vary in 
strength across subperiods.
The starting point of the analysis is a break-
down of the change in the investment in-come balance into accumulation and yield effects. The accumulation effect measures 
the isolated infl  uence of changes in net exter-nal assets (eg through net capital exports as-
sociated with current account surpluses, but 
also through valuation effects) on the invest-ment income balance. Yield effects generally result from the interplay between the fl  uctu-ations in income yields on the asset and liabil-ity sides of the external assets account. From 
an analytical perspective, subdivision into a yield level effect and a differential effect is worthwhile. The yield level effect captures the effects of changes in the international 
yield level, refl  ecting the precise impact they 
have on the average rate of interest on Ger-man foreign investments. If the average rate of interest on liabilities to non- resident invest-
ors does not run parallel to this, this ultim-
ately results in differential effects.
Furthermore, it must be noted that individ-
ual asset classes usually generate different yields. Portfolio shifts can therefore change 
the average yields on assets and liabilities. 
This phenomenon is accommodated 
through shift effects for both the yield level 
and differential effect. The latter does not, 
however, solely comprise the effects of 
changes in the yield differential in individual 
asset classes (pure yield differential effect). 
A contribution to the aggregated differen-
tial effect is also made when – against the 
background of a differing composition of external assets and liabilities – the yield 
levels of individual asset classes develop in 
different ways (leverage effect).
The breakdown of the change in the invest-
ment income balance into the effects de-
scribed above is based on the income and 
spending fl  ows as well as the asset and 
 liability holdings of 11 yield- bearing asset 
classes in the German balance of payments 
and the international investment position.1 
For the entire period from 1999 to 2014,2 
the main fi  nding is that, in mathematical 
1 Specifi  cally, the following asset classes are con-
sidered: 1) direct investment: a) equity capital, b) loans; 
2) securities: a) equities, b) investment fund shares, 
c) short- term debt securities, d) long- term debt secur-
ities; 3) other investment: a) monetary fi  nancial institu-tions, b) enterprises and individuals, c) general govern-
ment excluding the Bundesbank, d) Bundesbank ex-cluding TARGET2, e) TARGET2. The remaining com-ponents of net external assets are not considered in this analysis, as they either do not generate any in-
come as defi  ned in the balance of payments statistics (fi  nancial derivatives and cash) or the relevant income 
data are not available over the entire analysis period 
(reserve assets). The breakdown in discrete time is im-plemented using the Shapley- Siegel index. See L Shap-ley (1953), A value for n- person games, in: H W Kuhn and A W Tucker (eds), Contributions to the Theory of 
Games, Vol 2, Princeton University, pp 307-317; and

terms, the accumulation of net external 
assets accounted for just over half of the 
improvement in the investment income bal-
ance. The rest was attributable to yield ef-
fects.3 The swing in the yield differential in 
favour of German foreign assets had a strong positive impact. Although the de-
cline in the general yield level counteracted the improvement in the investment income 
balance, the effect of this was relatively 
minor over the entire period.
In the period between 1999 and 2014, four 
periods that each display characteristic 
trends can be identifi  ed. The fi  rst subperiod (1999 to 2003) covers the fi  nal phase and 
bursting of the dotcom bubble, which re-
sulted in a signifi  cant decline in cross- border 
direct investment, in particular. The global 
economic slowdown after the turn of the 
millennium led to persistent economic stag-
nation in Germany given the structural 
weaknesses at the time. The second subpe-
riod (2003 to 2007) was – in a global sense  – dominated by a fairly strong up-turn. During this time, structural reforms 
were implemented in Germany, culminating 
in more employment- intensive growth. In addition, domestic enterprises’ activities abroad increased considerably in this 
period. The effects of the fi  nancial crisis on the investment income balance are related, 
on the one hand, to the pronounced cyc-
lical volatility between 2008 and 2010 and, 
on the other hand, to international invest-
ors’ changed investment behaviour owing to new assessments of risk/return profi  les. The European sovereign debt crisis escal-ated until mid-2012, after which tensions eased. Against this backdrop, the phase from 2007 to 2012 is separated from the 
3 In the yield calculation undertaken here, investment 
income is based on average annual amounts outstand-ing (ie the arithmetical mean of the outstanding value at the end of the reporting year and at the end of the previous year). The amounts outstanding are valued at the market prices and exchange rates at the end of the 
reporting period, meaning that changes in amounts outstanding essentially also incorporate valuation ef-fects. The infl  uence of exchange rate fl  uctuations is 
likely to be of minor signifi  cance for the yield calcula-tion, since income payments are normally made in the currency in which the investment is denominated, and 
are posted to the investment income balance sheet during the year on an accrual basis. Theoretically 
speaking, the yield calculation remains undistorted by market price effects under the assumption that market 
valuations of the investments match expected future income. Since this cannot be assumed in every case 
and for all periods, investment income fl  ows are based on amounts outstanding adjusted for market price ef-fects in an alternative calculation which, however, only 
extends back to 2005 for reasons of data availability. 
In qualitative terms, this procedure does not change the plus or minus sign or the relative signifi  cance of the accumulation and yield effects. In quantitative terms, the accumulation effect would have to be somewhat greater and the differential effect slightly 
smaller in the period from 2007 to 2012.Breakdown of the change in the German investment income balance

subsequent years. This delineation also ap-
pears necessary from a statistical perspec-
tive because the fi  gures for 2013 and 2014 
still contain a comparatively high propor-
tion of estimates.
The investment income balance sheet re-
corded an average annual defi  cit of €19 bil-
lion between 1999 and 2003. This defi  cit 
arose because, on average, a higher yield 
was paid on liabilities to non- residents than 
German investors received for their practic-
ally equivalent holdings of foreign assets. 
The relatively minor change in the invest-ment income balance of -€3½ billion was almost exclusively attributable to a slightly 
negative accumulation effect. Yield changes had no notable effect on the balance.
Between 2003 and 2007, German invest-
ment income rose on balance by a signifi  -
cant €56 billion to +€35½ billion in 2007. The accumulation effect as well as both 
yield effects made a positive contribution to 
this. The biggest contribution, of +€27½ 
billion, was provided by the improvement in 
the yield differential. A crucial factor here 
was that the profi  tability of both direct in-
vestment and of investment fund shares 
and long- term loans held by German invest-
ors improved distinctly compared with 
those of non- residents in Germany. Also of signifi  cance was the fact that the yield level for asset classes in which the German econ-
omy as a whole had entered into a net 
creditor position (such as equity capital for 
direct investment) tended to rise more 
sharply than others (+€8 billion). As the 
climbing German current account surpluses 
since 2002 were also refl  ected in constantly growing net external assets (a rise of €502 billion between 2003 and 2007), the accu-
mulation effect played a signifi  cant role in 
the increase in German investment income, adding €25 billion. The slightly higher yield 
level was of little consequence compared with the other determining factors, contrib-uting +€3½ billion.
German net investment income again in-
creased clearly between 2007 and 2012, ris-
ing by €26½ billion to +€62 billion in 2012 
despite a temporary slump in 2008. To 
some extent, there were countervailing 
contributions from accumulation and yield 
effects. The accumulation effect made a distinctly positive contribution of +€11 bil-lion. In spite of the larger current account surpluses as against the 2003 to 2007 period, this contribution was no 
longer as high, since Germany’s net exter-Key indicators for the German

nal assets did not grow to the same extent 
as the cumulative fi  nancial account bal-
ances between 2007 and 2012 owing to valuation effects, other adjustments and changes to statistical conventions.
4 The 
yield level effect continued to have a clear 
braking effect on the increase in investment income, reducing the fi  gure by €8½ billion, 
as the international interest rate level de-clined considerably following the expan-sionary monetary policy measures imple-
mented in response to the global recession. 
A crucial factor here was that all asset 
classes, but particularly other investment by 
monetary fi  nancial institutions (MFIs), gen-
erated distinctly lower income than before.
By contrast, the differential effect boosted 
Germany’s investment income balance after the onset of the crisis (+€24 billion), primar-ily on account of safe haven fl  ows as part of 
investors’ altered risk perception. The larg-
est item originates from the price effect of 
safe haven fl  ows, which were expressed in 
the increase in the pure yield differential (+€32½ billion). This was chiefl  y attribut-
able to yield changes in the bond market, in 
which the effective interest rate decreased 
from 3¾% to 2¼% on the liability side be-tween 2007 and 2012, while the reduction 
on the asset side was signifi  cantly smaller, 
going from 4¾% down to 4¼%. The yield 
differential was adversely affected, how-
ever, because the interest rate on German 
net creditor positions, such as other invest-
ment by MFIs and investment fund shares, 
was lower than in the previous period 
(-€6½ billion).
The signifi  cant portfolio shifts after the 
onset of the crisis had no negative infl  uence on the investment income balance. On the asset side, the items that primarily gained in importance were TARGET2 claims, other in-vestment by public sector entities excluding 
the Bundesbank, long- term debt securities and direct investment, especially at the ex-
pense of other investment by MFIs and of 
equities. One reason for this can be found 
in a structural shift away from bank fi  nan-
cing resulting, amongst other things, from 
new capital requirements under Basel III. First and foremost, however, institutional mechanisms within the euro area and the 
process of combating the crisis ensured that 
the private sector’s share in external assets 
shifted in favour of public sector entities – 
particularly the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 
claims. However, the effect on the total bal-
ance of the rise in TARGET2 claims was 
more than offset in mathematical terms by 
the reduction in low- interest- bearing asset 
classes, such as other investment by MFIs, 
in favour of more profi  table ones, such as 
direct investment and long- term loans.5
From 2012 to 2014, the German investment 
income balance improved only slightly, by €2 billion, according to current fi  gures. 
Against the background of the German net 
external position recording clear increases (+€523 billion) owing to valuation effects amongst other factors, the accumulation 
effect was again considerable in this period (+€13 billion). However, dampening effects 
were felt from the continued drop in the yield level (-€3½ billion) and the deterior-
ation in the yield differential (-€7½ billion). 
The latter was primarily attributable to a 
partial reversal of the crisis- related develop-

tween changes in foreign assets and the cumulative 
fi  nancial account balance: unsuitable indicator of 
wealth losses, Monthly Report, May 2014, pp 48-50.5 In the fi  rst step, TARGET2 claims are remunerated at 
the Eurosystem reference rate and generate invest-
ment income as defi  ned in the balance of payments, 
which is recognised as Bundesbank income. This as-
pect is considered exclusively in this calculation. Since TARGET2 balances even out across all euro- area coun-
tries, they do not ultimately generate any monetary 
income for the Eurosystem as a whole and hence also for the Bundesbank. All of the Eurosystem’s monetary income is netted and allocated at the end of the year only. The compensatory amount is recorded in second-ary income for statistical purposes.Deutsche Bundesbank

accumulation of a large pool of net foreign 
assets. But it also owed much to the improved 
yield spread, which worked in favour of Ger -
man external assets, whereas the general 
 decline in the yield level since the start of the 
financial crisis has had a dampening effect on 
investment income (see also the box on 
pages 81 to 85). In 2011 and 2012, the yield 
spread on the assets side proved particularly 
high as foreign investment had still been profit -
able on balance. This contrasted with markedly 
reduced spending by domestic debtors in the 
wake of declining interest rates and low risk 
premiums. Over the past two years, the overall 
yield on the assets side contracted much more 
than on the  liabilities side, not least because of 
the easing of tensions in the international 
 financial markets. This meant that, although 
net external assets were still growing, much 
less investment income was being generated 
on balance.The secondary income balance, which captures 
current transfers between Germany and the 
rest of the world, closed in 2014 with a deficit 
of €37½ billion. This was €3½ billion less than 
in 2013. Expenditure for the reporting period 
went down by 4% to €95 billion. This was pre -
ceded, however, by a four- year increase in out -
ward current transfers amounting to a cumu -
lated rise of two-  fifths. At €56 billion, private-  
sector transfers in 2014 remained broadly un -
changed7 compared with the previous year, 
while public sector transfers declined by just 
over €4 billion to €39 billion in the wake of 
smaller transfers to the EU budget. Overall, cur -
rent transfers received from the rest of the 
world in 2014 were on a par with the 2013 
level.Smaller deficit 
from secondary incomement in the bond markets, which was re-
fl  ected in a negative pure yield differential 
effect (-€8½ billion). By contrast, the effects 
of portfolio shifts from assets (+€4 billion) 
and liabilities (-€4 billion) towards equities and, on the asset side, towards long- term 
debt securities as well offset each other in 
terms of the investment income balance.
To explain the increase in the investment in-
come surplus in the past ten years, it is not 
enough to look solely at the accumulation 
process for net external assets. The im-
provement in the yield differential between 
external assets and liabilities – especially with regard to equity capital for direct in-vestment and long- term debt securities – 
had the effect of additionally boosting the 
surplus, at least until 2012. The shifts within 
German external assets and liabilities after the onset of the fi  nancial and sovereign debt crisis offset each other for the most part in terms of their overall effect on the 
investment income balance. Given the size 
of Germany’s net external assets, cross- border investment income streams can be 
expected, on balance, to continue making 
clearly positive contributions to the current account in the coming years.
7 Owing to the changeover to a new system of classifica -
tion for the balance of payments, private receipts and ex -
penditure are now much larger in the secondary income 
account. The reason for this balance sheet increase is that 
the figures now include net premiums (excluding insurance 
services provided) and payments on claims made by in -
surers, notably reinsurers.Deutsche Bundesbank

Financial transactions
Underlying trends in financial 
transactions
Mirroring the current account surplus, Ger -
many again recorded high net capital exports 
in 2014. These amounted to €244 billion (com -
pared with €208 billion in 2013). Over 50% of 
this amount was attributable to portfolio in -
vestment. The current low- interest- rate envir -
onment was reflected by domestic investors’ 
greater interest in higher- yielding foreign secur -
ities. In return, German government bonds, 
which are considered particularly safe, re -
mained in demand abroad, although their 
yields have fallen steadily across all maturity 
segments owing to the generous volumes of 
liquidity being provided by the Eurosystem and 
expectations of large- scale purchases of secur -
ities for monetary policy purposes (quantitative 
easing). The impact of direct investment on the 
financial account was significantly higher in 
2014. Over the course of the year, direct invest -
ment accounted for around a third of net cap -
ital exports. Other investment also recorded 
capital outflows, but this figure was compara -
tively small. German financial corporations, in 
particular, supplied their foreign branches with 
additional funds. By contrast, the Bundesbank’s 
TARGET2 claims decreased again over the year 
as a whole. Against the background of increas -
ing uncertainty in the financial markets, how -
ever, they have recently been rising again.
Portfolio investment
In portfolio investment, which often clearly re -
flects developments in the international finan -
cial markets, net capital exports amounted to 
€127½ billion in 2014, compared to €164½ 
billion in 2013. This decline is mainly attribut -
able to a turnaround in foreign demand for 
German securities. While foreign investors sold 
German securities in 2013 on balance, they be -
came purchasers again last year. Foreign invest -
ors increased their holdings of German secur -ities by a total of €21½ billion in 2014, primarily 
through purchases of longer- dated debt secur -
ities and equities.
Cross-  border turnover in German bonds fell 
further in 2014. This owed much to structural 
factors such as the decline in the outstanding 
volume of bank debt securities. This may also 
be a sign of greater demand from buy- and- 
hold investors for debt securities than before. 
Overall, foreign investors purchased €21½ bil -
lion worth of German bonds on balance last 
year. They continued to expand their holdings 
of public debt securities. Purchases of public-  
sector bonds exceeded sales by €30 billion last 
year. This is higher than the 2013 figure, but 
lower than the net inflows of funds recorded 
between 2010 and 2012 (€75 billion a year on 
average). This means that Germany is still con -
sidered a safe haven by international investors; 
however, given that Bund yields are falling, the 
safe- haven factor seems to have diminished 
compared with the acute crisis years from 2010 
to 2012.
The trend towards high redemption rates for 
private- sector bonds seen in previous years 
continued. Foreign investors’ holdings of these 
long- term debt securities fell by €8½ billion in 
2014. A major contributory factor in this is that 
that the outstanding volume of bank debt se -
curities issued in Germany has been declining 
for years. The net capital exports therefore 
probably primarily reflect the shrinking supply 
offered by domestic issuers.
Holdings of domestic money market paper in 
foreign investors’ portfolios fell by €2½ billion 
in 2014. Net outflows of capital from trade in 
public- sector issues (€13½ billion) were broadly 
offset by net inflows of capital from private-  
sector short- dated debt securities (€11 billion). 
Non-residents’ sales and redemptions of public 
short- dated bonds were probably driven by the 
low (and sometimes negative) yields and a 
dwindling supply.Higher net

Demand for German shares continued to rise in 
2014, leading to a net capital import of €8½ 
billion. In 2014, the German equity market 
probably benefited from the pick- up in eco -
nomic activity towards the end of the year and 
the relatively favourable share price develop -
ments. By contrast, foreign investors sold Ger -
man mutual fund shares on balance in the con -
text of higher cross- border turnover, which re -
sulted in a net capital export of €5½ billion.
In inward transactions, German investors ac -
quired foreign securities to the tune of €149½ 
billion net in 2014, which roughly matched the 
net outflows in 2013 (€143 billion). Long- term 
debt securities are traditionally the most popu -
lar form of investment in this context. Via such 
purchases, German investors invested €99 bil -
lion net abroad. The balance vis-  à- vis the rest 
of the euro area remained largely unchanged. 
Domestic non- banks, which include insurance 
and investment firms, appeared to view the 
outlook for the countries most affected by the 
crisis somewhat more positively and expanded 
their stocks of corporate bonds issued by these 
countries, whereas German banks kept their 
holdings constant. In the second half of the 
year, in particular, German investors also 
bought larger volumes of fixed- income secur -
ities from the United States and the United 
Kingdom. Differences in the monetary policy 
stance may have been a factor in this. While 
the Federal Reserve wound down its quantita -
tive easing programme in the fourth quarter, 
further expansionary monetary policy measures 
were adopted in the euro area. In the foreign 
exchange markets, this resulted in exchange 
rate shifts to the detriment of the euro. In con -
trast to US securities, bonds and notes issued 
by Japan, which further accelerated the expan -
sion of the monetary base in 2014, were sold 
by domestic investors in the reporting year. All 
in all, net purchases of foreign currency bonds 
last year amounted to €17 billion (2013: €23½ 
billion). Bonds denominated in US dollars and 
Danish krone were in especially high demand.Countervailing

At €10½ billion, the volume of foreign equities 
purchased by domestic investors was some -
what smaller in 2014 than in 2013 (€19 billion). 
Demand eased off noticeably in the second 
half of the year, in particular. This is likely to 
have been due to the deterioration of the 
global economic outlook in late summer and 
resurging uncertainty in the euro area towards 
the end of the year about Greece’s economic 
policy course. However, a shift from equities 
into debt securities may also have played a role 
in respect of some countries. Portfolio shifts of 
this kind may have occurred with regard to in -
vestment in the USA and the UK where, as 
mentioned, demand for fixed- income securities 
rose in the second half of the year. Moreover, 
German shares significantly outperformed 
those of many other equity markets last year.
In 2014, German investors increased their level 
of indirect securities investment through foreign 
investment funds. Net outflows amounted to 
€38½ billion in the reporting year (€32 billion in 
2013). German investors continued to expand 
their holdings of mutual fund shares from the 
rest of the euro area, in particular. Capital ex -
ports to the rest of the euro area in this secur -
ities segment rose by 35% year on year.
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments) showed a rise in net capital exports to €32 bil -
lion in 2014. This represents an increase of 
more than 30% on the previous year. Forward 
and futures contracts accounted for just under 
three- quarters of the net capital exports, while 
the remaining quarter was mainly attributable 
to options. Financial derivatives were primarily 
acquired by credit institutions (€21 billion) and 
financial corporations (€6½ billion). Forward 
and futures contracts relating to electricity and 
gas, which are now included in this item fol -
lowing the changeover to the new Balance of 
Payments Manual (BPM6), accounted for a 
transaction volume of €2½ billion.
Direct investment
Given the fairly long- term nature of direct in -
vestment, the tense geopolitical situation led to 
slightly more subdued investment by enter -
prises in global terms. Thus the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development 
( UNCTAD) estimated that global direct invest -
ment declined by 8% to less than US$1½ tril -
lion.8 However, there were marked regional 
disparities. Developing countries and emerging 
market economies, which were the most popu -
lar investment destinations in previous years, 
increased their volume of inward investment 
last year, too. This increase amounted to 4%, 
bringing their share of global investment in -
flows to 56%. In the transition countries, by 
contrast, direct investment was halved to 
US$45 billion owing, inter alia , to the Russia-  
Ukraine conflict and economic problems in a 
number of other countries. The group of indus -
trial countries, too, recorded a significant de -
cline of 14% (to around US$700 billion). This 
affected the United States, in particular, as a 
foreign enterprise reduced its participating 
interest in a major American telecommunica -
tions company. Given the considerable volume 
of the transaction, it had an impact on foreign 
direct investment in the USA as a whole. By … counterbal-

contrast, the EU’s volume of inward direct in -
vestment went up by 13%.
For Germany, direct investment in 2014 re -
sulted in net capital exports of €83 billion, a 
nine- fold increase on 2013. On the one hand, 
this was due to the fact that foreign firms 
transferred less capital to Germany than at any 
time since 2004. However, this was due partly 
to an enterprise- specific development in intra-  
group credit transactions. Nonetheless, Ger -
many remains an attractive location for foreign 
investors, which is evident from the strong in -
flows of foreign equity capital. On the other 
hand, German enterprises stepped up their in -
vestment abroad.
At €88½ billion, outbound foreign direct in -
vestment by German enterprises significantly 
exceeded the 2013 figure (€53½ billion). Ger -
man firms mainly provided their foreign affili -
ates with more equity capital (€70½ billion), 
€22 billion of which was used to reinvest earn -
ings generated abroad.9 In addition, domestic 
enterprises’ cross- border credit transactions re -
sulted in outflows of €18½ billion. For one 
thing, German proprietors provided their affili -
ates abroad with loans, in particular. For an -
other, foreign subsidiaries based in Germany 
provided credit to their parent companies 
abroad.
German enterprises mostly pursue strategic ob -
jectives in terms of their direct investment 
abroad. According to a survey by the German 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK),10 
83% of enterprises said they focused on ex -
panding production capacity and boosting 
sales or customer services. A quarter of the en -
terprises surveyed reported that trade barriers 
were a further motivating factor for expanding 
their investment abroad. This applied particu -… but increase

larly to sales markets in South America, Russia 
or south- east Europe. Cost considerations 
–  first and foremost the potential to lower 
wage and energy costs – played a role for 21% 
of the enterprises. According to the study, 
these cost motives became more important in 
the context of Germany’s current energy and 
labour market policy.
The regional distribution of German direct in -
vestment largely reflects these motives. In 2014 
the lion’s share of direct investment, at €71½ bil -
lion, was targeted at other EU countries, which 
are also the main consumers of German prod -
ucts. According to the DIHK study, the EU has 
replaced China, which had ranked above it as a 
target for foreign expansion for four years, in the 
list of enterprises’ preferred locations. German 
firms perceived an improvement in the competi -
tiveness of their EU partner countries, making 
them a more attractive investment  location. Fur -
thermore, German enterprises increased their in -
vestment in China and South America in 2014. 
There was no major new investment in the 
United States owing to large losses sustained at 
a number of foreign enterprises, reflected by 
negative reinvested profits. Holding companies 
and manufacturing firms, especially in the auto -
motive industry, were the main investors. By 
contrast, German credit institutions scaled back 
their foreign investment last year.Non-  resident investors only expanded their in -
vestment in Germany by a marginal €5½ billion 
in 2014. In 2013 foreign direct investment in 
Germany had amounted to €44½ billion. Intra- 
group credit transactions were responsible for 
this decline. While foreign enterprises had pro -
vided German firms with loans amounting to 
€37 billion net in 2013, they withdrew €17 bil -
lion from Germany last year. The decline was 
heavily influenced by the transactions made by 
a single foreign enterprise. This turnaround in 
cross- border lending was counterbalanced by a 
relatively sharp rise in equity capital, which led 
to inflows to Germany of €22½ billion on bal -
ance (2013: €7½ billion). This indicates that 
Germany remains an attractive corporate in -
vestment location for foreign investors.
Companies from Europe, in particular, reduced 
their investment in German affiliated enter -
prises, while investors from North America and 
Asia expanded their foreign equity investments. 
The decline in direct investment from the rest 
of Europe was largely due to the repayment of 
intra- group loans at a Dutch parent company. 
Holding companies were very active in terms of 
expanding equity capital in Germany, whereas 
foreign investors from the financial sector with -
drew capital.
Other investment
Other investment, which comprises loans and 
trade credits (where these are not allocatable 
to direct investment) as well as bank deposits 
and other assets, again showed net capital ex -
ports amounting to €3½ billion in 2014. Both 
non- banks and the banking system recorded 
limited outflows of funds.
Over the year, countervailing transactions by 
non- banks roughly balanced each other out in 
net terms (net capital exports of €1 billion). In 
this context, government transactions resulted 
in net capital exports (€19½ billion). Govern -
ment entities increased their short- term foreign 
bank deposits abroad (€12 billion) while simul -Europe major

Recording euro currency in the balance of payments and 
the international investment position
Up until now, shortcomings in statistical cap-
abilities have prevented cross- border cash 
transactions and their offsetting entries from 
being recorded in the balance of payments 
(and in the international investment position, 
or IIP). These transactions include cash taken 
by seasonal and foreign workers to their 
home countries and capital transactions set-tled in cash. Cash travel expenditure by Ger-man residents and shipments of euro bank-notes abroad by the Bundesbank or German 
credit institutions used to be given special treatment. Although statistical data were available for both these variables, only one 
accounting entry used to be made, either in the services sub- account or in the “Other in-vestment” item under external assets held by 
the domestic  banking system.1 A matching 
offsetting entry on the liabilities side of the 
Bundesbank’s balance sheet (to depict the corresponding outfl  ows of banknotes) was 
not recorded because these outfl  ows would 
have provided a distorted picture of the overall impact of aggregate cross- border cash transactions over a longer- term hori-
zon. Instead, they were recorded under the 
“Net errors and omissions” item.
However, cash outfl  ows attributable to travel and shipments of euro banknotes have been exceptionally strong since the 
introduction of the euro, with an aggregate 
of €357½ billion, or just over 70% of the Bundesbank’s total net issuance, having 
since migrated abroad. The cumulative net 
effect of travel- related cross- border cash 
transactions is estimated at €201 billion. On 
top of that, euro banknote shipments have 
amounted to a cumulative €156 billion since 
January 2002. The bulk of this fi  gure – just 
under 75% – is likely to have made its way 
directly to countries outside the European monetary union, while just over a quarter 
ended up in other euro- area countries.
The scale and persistence of cash outfl  ows 
were thus one of the factors behind the sys-
temically positive “errors and omissions” which have been evident hitherto in Ger-many’s balance of payments. These amounted to an aggregate €247½ billion (prior to the recording of euro currency) 
 between January 2002 and year- end 2014.
There are several reasons why the statistical 
records are now being adapted. The primary objective is to enhance the comparability of 
the statistical results provided by the differ-
ent macrostatistical accounts at both the 
 national and international level. As a case in 
point, Germany’s fi  nancial accounts already 
take account of these transactions, as do 
some of the balance of payments statistics 
recorded by other euro- area countries, ei-
ther because it was an ECB requirement or 
because it appeared worthwhile from a na-tional perspective. Another contributory fac-tor from a German vantage point is the fact 
that the systematically positive “errors and 
omissions” were making it increasingly diffi   -
cult to interpret the statistical output. Add-
itionally, it became increasingly clear in the 
meantime that the above sources of infor-
mation could be used to implement a pro-
cess that was suited to producing statistical data and which was also capable of painting a robust picture of foreign demand for euro currency
2 over a longer- term horizon, too.3
1 Cash (and aggregate) travel expenditure abroad by 
residents is captured for both the rest of the euro area 
and for countries outside the European monetary 
union (EMU) by a household survey which the Bundes-
bank conducts as part of its balance of payments stat-
istics. Furthermore, there are statistical sources that record shipments of euro banknotes by domestic credit institutions or by the Bundesbank to foreign banks. See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Recording 
cross- border cash transactions in the balance of pay-
ments, Monthly Report, March 2005, p 37.2 Total cash outfl  ows would comprise both banknotes 
and coins. However, foreign demand for German-
issued euro coins cannot be captured statistically, and its value is negligible relative to that of the banknotes 
in circulation. Hence, any external liabilities the Ger-
man government may have in its capacity as an issuer of euro coins are not recorded as a separate item.3 See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Foreign demand for 
euro banknotes issued in Germany, Monthly Report, 
January 2011, pp 29-41. It should be noted, by way of 
explanation, that the term “foreign demand” means the net issues which have migrated abroad; these 
issues are not, however, necessarily still in circulation 
abroad because other euro- area central banks may 
have taken them out of circulation in the meantime.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
March 2015

The starting point for estimating cross- 
border cash transactions is the aforemen-tioned set of statistics on travel and bank-
note shipments. The travel survey conducted 
on the Bundesbank’s behalf also provides 
data on cash expenditure abroad by German 
business and holiday travellers in euro cur-rency. By applying the share of cash trans-
actions observed for residents (which can be extracted from these data) to German travel 
receipts as well, it is possible to estimate a 
net outfl  ow of cash from the travel account. A fi  gure for net banknote shipments, mean-
while, can be obtained directly from the Bundesbank’s surveys. Both components 
amount, on aggregate, to a net outfl  ow of 
cash, which is captured for the respective re-porting period in the balance of payments.
4 
By adding up these fl  ows over time, it is pos-sible to calculate the total value of euro cur-rency that has migrated abroad, on balance, 
since the beginning of 2002. This is the 
 fi  gure of €357½ billion mentioned earlier in this box, which is recorded as additional ex-ternal liabilities of the Bundesbank in the IIP .
5The statistical recording of cross- border cash transactions is also closely related to the treatment of the items concerning 
banknotes in circulation in the Bundes-
bank’s balance sheet, which takes account 
of the particular features of the European 
monetary union in terms of the issuance of 
banknotes within the Eurosystem.6
A distinction is made in the balance sheet be-tween the banknotes in circulation
7 – as per 
the banknote allocation key – and the liabil-
ities resulting from the distribution of the euro banknotes in circulation within the 
 Eurosystem.8 Hence, the external statistics for 
Germany need to record the following items.
– In Germany, the (estimated) volume of banknotes in circulation domestically is lower than the volume of banknotes in circulation as per the allocation key (€240½ billion).
9 At year- end 2014, the 
difference thus represents foreign de-mand for banknotes issued in Germany (€89½ billion), which the Bundesbank 
4 Specifi  cally, it is captured under “Other investment” 
liabilities of the Bundesbank, in the currency and de-
posits item.
5 This item was fi  rst recognised in the IIP at the end of March 2015, when the statistical data as at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 were published.6 As a general rule, banknotes represent a liability for 
the central bank that issues them. In the European 
monetary union, euro banknotes are brought into cir-culation by the Eurosystem, that is, jointly by the ECB and the national central banks. The resulting liabilities 
are apportioned to the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem in line with the banknote 
 allocation key.
7 The national liabilities resulting from the banknotes 
in circulation are calculated for each national central 
bank by multiplying the banknote allocation key by the total circulation in the euro area. The banknotes in cir-
culation are a variable that is defi  ned by law but is 
nonetheless designed to refl  ect realistic economic cir-
cumstances.
8 Euro- area countries whose actual net issuance is 
lower than the volume in circulation as per the alloca-tion key carry a corresponding item on the assets side 
of their balance sheet. By defi  nition, the offsetting 
items of all the euro- area countries (including the ECB) balance each other out on aggregate.
9 Domestic circulation is estimated as the difference 
between net banknote issuance by the Bundesbank 
and foreign demand calculated as outlined above.Euro currency in the balance of payments and the international investment position

taneously reducing, in particular, their short-  
term liabilities to foreign creditors (€6 billion). 
Moreover, the outflows of funds from the 
cross- sectoral item “other equity” (€6 billion) 
are mainly attributable to government transac -
tions; this position contains the German gov -
ernment’s capital increase in the European Sta -
bility Mechanism (ESM). By contrast, transac -
tions by enterprises and households resulted in 
capital inflows of €19 billion. On the one hand, 
they reduced their balances with foreign banks 
(€11½ billion). The reduction in short- term de -
posits, notably by non- financial corporations, 
was partly counterbalanced by a smaller expan -
sion in long- term deposits by other financial 
corporations, in particular. On the other hand, 
firms and households reduced their long-  term 
loans abroad (€6 billion).
In the banking system as a whole, the net out -
flow of funds amounted to €3 billion. Unsecu -
ritised foreign operations of German credit in -
stitutions led to significant net capital exports of €44 billion. For the first time since the col -
lapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, they espe -
cially expanded their interbank loans to the rest 
of the world (€84 billion). However, this did not 
involve an increase in loans to other banks, but 
rather the provision of funds to their own for -
eign affiliates in financial centres. Conversely, 
higher deposits from non- residents at German 
institutions resulted in an inflow of funds to the 
banking system (€32½ billion). The capital out -
flows from credit institutions contrasted with 
inflows resulting from the decline in the Bun -
desbank’s external position (€41 billion). This 
was chiefly due to a reduction in claims in the 
large- value payment system TARGET2 (€49½ 
billion). This position had already recorded a 
significant decrease in 2013 (€145½ billion); 
before this, it had risen for six consecutive 
years, mainly as a result of the crisis. The 
change in the TARGET2 position last year re -
flected the fact that the markets considered the 
situation in most of the countries strongly af -
fected by the crisis to have improved further; … and the 
banking systemcarries in its balance sheet as external li-
abilities from banknote issuance.
– Overissuance of banknotes: This is calcu-
lated as the actual German issuance of banknotes (€508½ billion at year- end 
2014), less banknote issuance as per the allocation key. Calculated thus, overissu-ance amounted to €268 billion. This fi  g-
ure is recognised in the external statistics 
as external liabilities from deposits by 
other national central banks with the 
Bundesbank.
All in all, the aforementioned foreign de-mand for German banknote issuance at year- end 2014 therefore amounted to €357½ billion (2013: €329 billion). A net 
capital import of €28 billion is recognised in the balance of payments to refl  ect the year- on- year increase recorded in 2014.
On the whole, it can be said that incorpor-
ating cross- border cash transactions into 
the statistics has a major impact on the bal-ance of payments and on Germany’s exter-
nal liabilities. It results in additional net cap-
ital imports being captured, reduces “errors 
and omissions” and boosts the analytical 
value of the balance of payments, besides 
signifi  cantly shrinking Germany’s net exter-
nal position.
There is no doubt that recording cross- 
border cash transactions in the statistics im-
proves the consistency and international comparability of external statistics. That being said, it is also evident that external 
statistics are being stretched to their limits 
in the context of the European monetary union. Economically, the liabilities arising from banknote issuance ought to be allo-cated to the Eurosystem as a whole; in  actual fact, they are apportioned among 
the individual euro- area countries according to uniform accounting rules, which statisti-cians are now looking to replicate as closely as possible.Deutsche Bundesbank

these countries have evidently become more 
attractive in the context of investors’ increased 
search for yield.
The Bundesbank’s external liabilities also de -
creased, resulting in a net capital outflow (€9 
billion). This was chiefly due to a large with -
drawal of deposits from accounts held at the 
Bundesbank by a non- euro- area central bank. 
However, this contrasted with inflows of €28 
billion arising from cross- border transactions in -
volving euro banknotes. Owing to a lack of re -
liable data sources, these transactions were not 
previously recorded in the balance of payments; 
more recent estimates now make it possible for 
figures to be recorded retroactively for the 
period since the introduction of euro bank -
notes and coins in 2002.11
Reserve assets
Transaction- related changes in the reserve 
assets are shown as a separate item in the bal -ance of payments. In 2014, they fell by €2½ 
billion owing to a decrease in the reserve pos -
ition with the IMF and in the foreign reserves.
The international reserve holdings were also in -
fluenced by balance sheet adjustments which, 
in line with internationally agreed accounting 
standards, are not recognised in the balance of 
payments. The end- of- year revaluation of the 
reserve assets at market prices resulted in a rise 
of €17½ billion in 2014, primarily as the result 
of valuation gains arising from the appreciation 
of the US dollar. These were reflected not only 
by exchange rate- related gains in the foreign 
reserves, but also by a clear upward valuation 
of the gold holdings. All in all, Germany’s re -
serve assets rose by €15 billion in balance sheet 
terms in 2014; at the cut- off date of 31 Decem -
ber 2014, they amounted to €158½ billion.Transactions

Securities holdings statistics for analysing 
holdings of securities in Germany and 
Europe: methodology and results
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in autumn 2008 made it clear that detailed information on 
what investors hold which securities, by whom they are issued and in what volume is vital for 
fulfilling the tasks of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem national central banks. 
For this reason, in the fourth reporting quarter of 2013, securities holdings statistics were intro -
duced across Europe; the national central banks submit these statistics on a security- by- security 
basis to the Securities Holdings Statistics Database, which is jointly operated by the Bundesbank 
and the ECB. These statistics comprise holdings of debt securities, shares and investment fund 
shares. On the one hand, sectoral data are recorded, with the securities holdings being broken 
down by economic sector and the investor’s country of origin. This focuses on the securities of 
euro- area investors and paper issued by residents and held by investors outside the Eurosystem. 
On the other hand, the group data capture the own holdings of the largest banking groups in the 
euro area.
The Bundesbank’s securities holdings statistics form the basis of the German contribution to the 
Securities Holdings Statistics Database. To compile these statistics, the Bundesbank collects group 
data from large German banking groups as well as sectoral data from all financial institutions 
domiciled in Germany. As the sectoral data have been available on a security- by- security basis 
since the end of 2005, it is already possible at present to conduct in- depth analyses and research 
projects on the scale and structure of securities holdings in Germany. This makes it possible to 
investigate the developments in securities holdings since the outbreak of the global financial 
 crisis. The data furthermore provide information about the distribution of the volume of securities 
held in Germany among the various groups of investors. In addition, derived flow variables can 
be used to assess to what extent changes in holdings based on market prices are due to the 
securities transactions of individual groups of investors or to other developments such as price 
adjustments.
The introduction of harmonised securities holdings statistics and uniform processes for compiling 
data for the Securities Holdings Statistics Database at the European level further improves the 
comparability, quality and completeness of data. The information from across Europe allows a 
variety of flexible analyses to be conducted, in particular for risk- prone segments of the European 
financial system. The symmetrical access of the entire Eurosystem to all data is a significant factor 
as it ensures a uniform information base for decision- making processes of the European commit -
tees. Future developments in the securities holdings statistics of the European System of Central 
Banks (ESCB) are closely linked to the provision of microdata for other statistical fields. For 
example, an expansion of group data is currently under consideration to enable securities hold -
ings micro data to be analysed in connection with the granular information from the planned 
European credit register.Deutsche Bundesbank

Subject matter and purpose 
of the German and European 
securities holdings statistics
With its securities holdings statistics (formerly 
known as securities deposit statistics), the Bun -
desbank has been collecting data on securities 
holdings of financial institutions in Germany 
since 1962. The statistics were initially collected 
annually and comprised a limited quantity of 
aggregated data. Due to the growing import -
ance of securities data for responding to mon -
etary policy as well as micro and macropruden -
tial issues, the statistics on securities holdings 
have been gradually expanded over the years. 
Since 2013, the data are collected on a monthly 
basis and, as the German contribution, are fed 
into the euro area’s Securities Holdings Statis -
tics Database. This database contains all the se -
curity holdings information supplied by central 
banks in the ESCB.
To ensure uniform statistical concepts and, 
thus, comparable security holdings data, Regu -
lation ECB/ 2012/ 24 was adopted in conjunc -
tion with Guideline ECB/ 2013/ 7,1 stating that 
the reporting scheme for securities holdings 
statistics in the euro area comprises the hold -
ings of debt securities, listed shares and invest -
ment fund shares or units.2 All holdings data 
are generally granular, which means that they 
are made available on a security- by- security 
basis. On the one hand, securities holdings are 
broken down by economic sectors in line with 
ESA 2010, and by the investors’ country of ori -
gin (sectoral data). On the other hand, the data 
capture the securities holdings of large banking 
groups in the euro area (group data).3 In the 
latter case, the relevant group parent transmits 
information on the individual entities’ own 
holdings of securities.4
Besides the data on holdings of securities sent 
by the reporting agents, information on issuers, 
securities and prices made available through 
the Centralised Securities Database of the ESCB 
is also used to compile both the German and 
European securities holdings statistics.5 Linking securities holdings and reference information 
makes it possible to conduct extensive ana -
lyses, including on risks relating to certain se -
curities, issuers, investors, countries or selected 
currencies.
The securities holdings statistics represent an 
important source for the financial accounts in 
capturing the flow of funds in the European 
economies as well as for the net external pos -
ition in showing the volume and structure of 
external assets and liabilities. The data are, 
moreover, used for the public finance statistics, 
which form the basis for calculating European 
countries’ Maastricht debt level. In addition, 
the International Monetary Fund uses securities 
holdings data as part of the Coordinated Port -
folio Investment Survey in order to close infor -
mation gaps in cross-  border securities trans-
actions and holdings.
Demand for detailed information on securities 
holdings has remained at a high level since the 
onset of the global financial and sovereign 
debt crisis in the euro area. The large number 
and increased complexity of financial products 
on offer, the higher volume of investment in 
the securities markets as well as the impact of 
monetary and financial policy measures are re -
flected in the securities holdings statistics. For Developments in

ings of securities and Guideline ECB/ 2013/ 7 concerning 
statistics on holdings of securities were published in the 
Official Journal of the European Communities on 1 Novem -
ber 2012 (OJ L 305, p 6) and 7 May 2013 (OJ L 125, p 17) 
respectively.
2 The term security and the distinctions between the vari -
ous types of securities are in line with the definitions of the 
European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010.
3 The banking groups subject to reporting requirements are 
selected on the basis of the consolidated balance sheet to -
tals pursuant to ECB guidelines on the transmission of con -
solidated banking data in banking supervision (see S Bor -
gioli, A C Gouveia und C Labanca (2013), Financial Stability 
Analysis, Insights Gained from Consolidated Banking Data 
for the EU, ECB Occasional Paper Series No 140).
4 A banking group within the meaning of these statistics 
comprises the parent institution, ie a credit institution or a 
financial holding company, as well as all associated finan -
cial subsidiaries and branches which do not constitute in -
surance corporations. The basis of consolidation was deter -
mined in line with prudential supervisory regulations (see 
Directive 2006/ 48/EC).

example, the sectoral data in the Securities 
Holdings Statistics Database for euro- area in -
vestors contained around 0.6 million different 
securities as of the second quarter of 2014. Be -
sides traditional financial products, such as 
shares and bonds, investors have been increas -
ingly focusing on hybrid forms of investment 
and structured products such as asset- backed 
securities and contingent convertible bonds. At 
the European level, the sectoral data for the 
second quarter of 2014 show the holdings of 
residents of the respective euro- area countries 
reaching a total amount of €23,352 billion at 
market prices.6
Closing information gaps 
through the collection of 
statistics on a security- by- 
security basis
Depending on the question to be studied, ei -
ther aggregated or granular data can basically 
be suitable. Aggregates are often used to re -
duce complexity and to gain an overview by 
summarising detailed information. For ex -
ample, it may be helpful to analyse the German 
stock index (DAX) in order to estimate market 
trends rather than looking at the individual 
company figures it contains. Yet, the higher 
each level of aggregation is, the more informa -tion is lost, which is not always desirable. How -
ever, to perform their functions, it is vital for 
the central banks in Europe and the ECB to be 
able to draw on data of a high statistical stand -
ard which are as free as possible of information 
gaps.
The rapid technological progress of recent 
years in the area of information technology has 
opened up the possibility of large volumes of 
data being saved, prepared and flexibly ana -
lysed within a short space of time. This created 
an environment in which the European central 
banks and the ECB were able to replace aggre -
gate information gathered with granular data 
based on individual securities and to meet the 
existing information requirements.
Detailed micro data are increasingly gaining im -
portance within the ESCB, not least due to the 
fact that they can be used as a basis for con -
densing into aggregate data at any time. Ag -
gregates on securities holdings gathered else -
where can be modelled using the data col -
lected on a security- by- security basis. As a re -

supervision generally no longer appears to be 
absolutely essential.7 Moreover, granular secur -
ities holdings information makes it possible to 
respond flexibly to new requirements and, if 
necessary, to provide individually tailored statis -
tics without having to change the underlying 
method of data collection. As the reporting 
procedure does not have to be adapted so 
often, this ultimately leads to cost savings for 
the reporting agents.
The introduction of Europe- wide information 
on a security- by- security basis brings with it a 
cross- border standardisation of procedures. For 
example, data are now condensed centrally ac -
cording to uniform rules, which has the effect 
of harmonising statistical aggregates. Further -
more, micro data are useful for data producers 
as they allow quality checks in greater depth. 
Also, it is possible to compare total holdings 
with the corresponding issuance volume on a 
security- by- security basis, for example to iden -
tify and rule out multiple reporting of a single 
securities holding.8 A granular database also 
makes it possible to monitor individual pos -
itions over time, which is particularly informa -
tive if the relevant aggregates are determined 
on the basis of micro values.
Securities holdings can be analysed over time 
using both total holdings and securities pur -
chases and sales. Since recording all securities 
transactions that have actually been carried out 
would require considerable time and effort, a 
concept for deriving transactions from changes 
in securities holdings was developed for the se -
curities holdings statistics. The availability of 
data on a security- by- security basis means that 
it is possible to separately calculate the deter -
minants of flows in securities holdings, such as 
financial transactions and price and exchange 
rate adjustments. This makes it possible to cap -
ture the cumulative securities transactions of a 
given period with sufficient accuracy (see the 
box on pages 99 to 101).
The introduction of statistics at the individual 
security level and the associated increase in the volume of data require investment in adequate 
information technologies as well as experts 
with the ability to obtain relevant information 
from the abundance of data. In addition, the 
amount of confidential micro data generally in -
creases along with growing granularity. To 
guarantee data protection and security, the 
relevant technological and organisational pre -
cautions need to be made prior to such data 
collection.
Results of the securities 
holdings statistics (sectoral 
data)
For the statistics on securities holdings, just 
under 2,000 financial institutions domiciled in 
Germany report securities holdings for resident 
and non- resident customers as part of their 
custody business.9 In addition, domestic banks 
provide information about their own holdings, 
irrespective of the country in which the secur -
ities are held. Besides the data to be collected 
for the Europe- wide Securities Holdings Statis -
tics Database, the German sectoral data on 
banks’ own securities holdings comprise add -
itional information on book values, investment 
motives and repos. For their customer safe cus -
tody accounts, financial institutions also report 
the total number of securities deposits they 
manage broken down by the investors’ eco -
nomic sectors.10Detailed data

Methodology for deriving transactions from fl  ows 
in  securities holdings on a security- by- security basis
The method which is applied for determin-
ing transactions in the securities holdings 
statistics and in the Securities Holdings Stat-
istics Database is explained below. With this method, fl  ows in securities holdings can be 
used to approximate the cumulative secur-
ities transactions during a given period (eg 
monthly). The concept is based on ESA 2010 in which the fl  ows are fi  rst broken 
down into their components.
If these principles are applied to individual 
securities, a fl  ow between two points in 
time may be the outcome of fi  nancial trans-actions, adjustments in prices and exchange 
rates, the compound  effect or other 
volume- driven adjustments. The compound effect is a residual resulting from the simul-taneous occurrence of adjustments in mar-
ket prices and exchange rates and which cannot clearly be ascribed to one of the two causes of adjustment. Other volume- driven adjustments in holdings comprise 
fl  ows due, say, to reclassifi  cations. This in-
cludes changes in the characteristics of the 
securities (such as a change in the type of 
security, the currency of issuance or the ma-turity) as well as in the securities issuers and investors (sector or country of domicile, for example).
In line with this approach, a change in the 
holdings of an individual security comes 
about as follows:
where  denotes the securities hold-
ings1,  the fi  nancial transaction, 
 the other volume- driven adjustment, 
 the price adjustment  the ex-
change rate adjustment,  the 
compound effect and  the interest in-
come, all valued at market prices (MV) and 
denominated in euro at time t.
While the nominal change in holdings (
) refl  ects the nominal transac-
tion  plus the other nominal volume-

over time, such as redemption bonds, a pool factor 
has also to be taken into account. To improve readabil-
ity, we forgo the corresponding formal representation at this point.

driven adjustment, additional components 
for the price and exchange rate adjustments 
as well as the compound effect are needed 
for the analysis of a market- price- related 
fl  ow in holdings. The securities holdings can be valued at market prices using either the 
clean price ( ) or the dirty price ( ). The 
difference between the two variables is ex-plained by the differing treatment of the ac-
crued interest ait during the period, where 
 applies.
The securities holdings are generally valued 
at the clean price. However, the fi  nancial transaction is calculated including interest 
accrued during the relevant period. Conse-
quently, the sum of the individual fl  ow 
components would be greater than the dif-
ference in the holdings based on market 
prices. In order to obtain correct results, the interest income relevant to fi  xed- income se-
curities  (ie the accrued interest con-
tained in the fi  nancial transaction) has to be subtracted as a further component.
As it is not known at what point in time a 
transaction has taken place or whether intra- period transactions were carried out, the net transaction is valued at average 
prices  and exchange rates .
The fi  nancial transaction valued at market 
prices  can be calculated as follows:
with  and  as 
the average price and exchange rate at 
time t.
The other volume- driven adjustment  
may be valued as follows:
 with xt as the ex-
change rate at time t. takes account of the impact which 
adjustments in the price of the security 
have on the fi  nal holdings based on market 
prices, with the exchange rate being kept 
constant:
The fi  rst summand measures the valuation 
adjustment that is to be ascribed to the ori-
ginal holdings . The second summand 
explains the share of the price change that is caused by the transaction. In other words, 
this represents the new valuation/defl  ation 
of the security between the purchase/sale 
price and the end of the period. To do this, the current market price is set in relation to 
the average market price at which the 
transaction is valued.
The impact of fl  uctuating exchange rates is 
captured by the adjustment in the exchange rate 
, with the price being kept con-
stant:
The fi  rst summand measures the valuation 
adjustment that is to be ascribed to the ori-
ginal holdings . The second summand 
explains the share of the exchange rate ad-
justment that is due to the transaction, ie the difference between the average ex-
change rate at which the transaction is val-
ued and the exchange rate at the end of 
the period.
If the transaction component  is sub-
tracted from the difference in the holdings 
based on market prices, there remains a 
variable which comprises all non- Deutsche Bundesbank

The sectoral data serve as a basis for a range of 
analyses on the scope and structure of secur -
ities holdings in Germany. In this way, annual 
developments in securities holdings at market 
values can, for example, be examined for the 
various types of securities over the past eight 
years, ie including since the outbreak of the 
global financial and sovereign debt crisis in the 
euro area.
When the global crisis broke out, the market 
value of the total volume of listed share hold -
ings initially plummeted (-41%) and then re -
covered only slowly up to the end of 2010 
– without, however, returning to the original 
value – before hitting a further low in Decem -
ber 2011. Nevertheless, at the end of Novem -
ber 2014, holdings reached market values that 
were higher than shortly before the financial 
crisis.11 The movements of all listed share hold -
ings essentially reflect developments in the 
DAX during the same period.12Viewed over time, however, investment fund 
shares held in Germany moved in parallel to 
but with a slight lag behind listed shares. The 
relevant volumes have been above those of 
listed shares since December 2008, thus repre -
senting the second largest item among the cat -
egories of securities analysed. While holdings 
of listed shares returned to their level of De -
cember 2007 in terms of their market value, 
the volumes of investment fund shares based 
on market values increased on a scale (48%) 
unmatched by any other category of securities.Developments in

the adjustment component. The following

when either no exchange rate adjustment 
or no price adjustment takes place.
Together, the components calculated in this 
way give the fl  ow in holdings between two points in time.

12 Developments in the market value of total holdings of 
listed shares reported in Germany (currently around 27,000 
national and international securities, including participation 
certificates) indicate a high correlation with developments 
in the corresponding DAX 30 securities volume, with an 
average of 54% of listed share holdings being attributable 
to DAX 30 values between December 2007 and November

Developments in the volumes of short and 
long- term debt securities produce a mixed pic -
ture. Based on market values, holdings of the 
largest type of security under consideration 
– long-  term debt securities with a maturity of 
more than one year – are characterised by 
largely stable growth. With the exception of a 
marked decline in December 2011, the volume 
of holdings based on market values rose by 
around 21% between December 2007 and the 
end of November 2014, with annual average 
growth of just under 3%. By contrast, follow -
ing an initial steady rise, holdings of short- term 
debt securities with a maturity of up to one 
year peaked at the end of 2009. Thereafter they declined significantly, with the maximum 
volume of holdings recorded in December 
2009 having already halved in December 2011.
Holdings of securities in Germany can also be 
analysed according to various groups of invest -
ors. For this purpose, domestic investors are 
broken down below into non- financial corpor -
ations, monetary financial institutions (banks), 
institutional investors,13 general government 
(comprising central, state and local govern -
ment and social security funds) and households 
(including non- profit institutions serving house -
holds), while foreign investors are combined to 
form a single investor group.14
The volume of securities holdings in Germany 
calculated on the basis of market prices as at 
November 2014 totalled €8,914 billion, almost 
two- thirds of which are held by domestic in -
vestors, with the remaining 37% (€3,277 bil -
lion) of total holdings being owned by foreign 
investors. Institutional investors, especially in -
vestment funds, are the main domestic holders 
of securities, with a share of 28% (€2,509 bil -
lion). Monetary financial institutions form the 
second- largest domestic investor group, with 
their own holdings accounting for just under 
one- fifth (€1,544 billion) of the total volume. 
The banking sector’s share thus roughly corres -
ponds to the combined share of the next two 
largest sectors: households (€944 billion) and 
non- financial corporations (€479 billion). The 
general government sector is the smallest in -
vestor group; their securities holdings amount 
to around 2% (€161 billion) of the total vol -
ume.

significance in the portfolios of monetary finan -
cial institutions and general government. For 
the latter sectors, long- term debt securities, in 
particular, predominate.15 Investment fund 
shares are primarily held by institutional invest -
ors, followed by households as the second-  
largest group of investors. Viewed in absolute 
terms, given the current low- interest- rate envir -
onment, short- term debt securities and money 
market fund shares play a fairly minor role in 
the safe custody accounts of the investor 
groups as a whole. The comparatively high per -
centage of holdings of listed shares in the port -
folios of non- financial corporations (61%) can 
mainly be explained by strategic investment, as 
they are often participating interests in affili -
ated enterprises within a group. Long- term 
debt securities account for just under 85% of 
the holdings of monetary financial institutions. 
These largely comprise domestic and foreign 
bank debt securities as well as government 
bonds, most of which were issued abroad.16
The breakdown of securities holdings by in -
vestor group makes possible a variety of ana -
lyses. If financial transactions and other changes 
in the volume of assets are derived statistically 
from the flows in securities holdings (see the 
box on pages 99 to 101), it is possible to study 
the trading activities of individual investor 
groups, for example. Looking at the compon -ents of the flows based on market values be -
tween October and November 2014 across all 
securities categories, highlights the fact that, 
alongside financial transactions, the price effect 
is of major significance. While households, 
monetary financial institutions and general 
government top up their securities portfolios 
on the whole, sales of securities predominate 
in the case of non- financial corporations, insti -
tutional investors and foreign investors. Owing 
to the price effect, which reflects the positive 
market developments in late autumn, the se -
curities holdings of all investor groups show an 
increase, however.
In recent years, the availability of data on a 
security- by- security basis has resulted in a 
range of research projects drawing on sectoral 
data from the Bundesbank’s securities holdings 
statistics. In a recent paper, Buch, Koetter and 
Ohls, for example, examine the relationship be -
tween German banks’ investment in govern -
ment bonds and these institutions’ risk profile. 
They furthermore examine to what extent Decline in trans-
actions currently being offset by price increasesSelected  research pro-jects on invest -

16 In principle, in terms of their chronology all securities 
holdings can additionally be broken down by economic 
sector or country of origin of the respective issuer. A de -
tailed presentation of this would go beyond the scope of

these banks have adjusted their share of gov -
ernment bonds in the wake of the global finan -
cial crisis. The analysis shows that, between 
2005 and 2010, numerous banks did not hold 
any government bonds, that institutions invest -
ing in them showed a fluctuating degree of 
 diversification, and that, since the bankruptcy 
of Lehman Brothers, banks have been increas -
ingly taking macroeconomic factors into ac -
count when making investment decisions.17
Fecht, Hackethal and Karabulut examine the 
business policy of universal banks in retail bank -
ing. They find that the institutions systematic -
ally sell shares from their own trading portfolio 
to their customers, and that the returns on 
these securities that they have passed on are 
lower than those on the other shares in their 
own portfolio and also lower than the returns 
on other shares in their private customers’ 
holdings.18
In another study, Kick, Onali, Ruprecht and 
Schaeck investigate to what extent households 
and non- financial corporations reshuffle their 
securities portfolios as a result of macroeco -
nomic wealth shocks and microeconomic sup -
ply shocks. Their results show that, given losses 
in securities investments, it is households in 
particular which – having invested a large per -
centage of their funds in government bonds of crisis- hit European countries – change the com -
position of their portfolios. If there is a reduc -
tion in the supply of credit, both households 
and non- financial corporations decrease their 
portfolio concentration.19
Baltzer, Stolper and Walter study the geograph -
ical composition of households’ holdings of 
shares. They find that the securities of local 
public limited companies account for a higher 
share in the portfolio of households than would 
be recommendable on the basis of an optimal 
diversification strategy. This phenomenon of 
local bias is observed by the authors across na -
tional borders.20
In a recently published study, Baltzer, Jank and 
Smajlbegovic analyse the trading behaviour of 
various investor groups on the German stock 
market. They focus on the momentum effect, Securities holdings according to category of investor and security

which states that shares that performed well in 
the past will continue to deliver above- average 
returns, whereas shares that have performed 
poorly hitherto will also underperform the mar -
ket in the future. They show that it is mainly 
foreign institutional investors and domestic 
 financial investors that pursue a momentum 
strategy, whereas domestic households act as a 
contrarian.21

Data collected across Europe 
for the Securities Holdings 
Statistics Database
The ESCB’s Centralised Securities Database has 
been providing price and reference data since 
2005, in particular for securities which are is -
sued or held by residents of the European 
Union and for securities denominated in euro. 
Corresponding information on securities hold -
ings was not collected initially. This led to an 
advisory group being set up in 2008 to exam -
ine the need for European microdata on secur -
ities holdings and the practicability of the re -
quirements. The results of this initiative formed 
the basis for the design of the standardised re -
porting scheme used for the Securities Hold -
ings Statistics Database.23 In the field of sec -
toral data, this mainly comprises holdings of 
securities by euro- area investors and securities 
issued by residents and held by non- euro area 
investors.24 The group data currently contain 
information on the global own holdings of the 
25 largest banking groups in the euro area.Since the fourth reporting quarter of 2013, 25 
European central banks have been submitting 
harmonised information on securities holdings 
to the Securities Holdings Statistics Database. 
This is a data production and analysis system 
for securities holdings operated jointly by the 
Bundesbank and the ECB on a quarterly basis. 
The Bundesbank receives information from 
across Europe, links the transmitted data to the 
harmonised price and reference data of the 
Centralised Securities Database, carries out a 
data quality control and performs calculations 
on a security- by- security basis, such as the cal -
culation of flows, for example. The ECB then 
takes over the granular data in order to prepare 
standardised or individually processed Euro -
pean statistical results for the various tasks of 
the ESCB. Under certain conditions, data re -

ESCB can be met, for example for the European 
Systemic Risk Board, European supervisory au -
thorities, the European Commission and inter -
national organisations (such as the International 
Monetary Fund and the Bank for International 
Settlements).
In order to guarantee complete and non-  
overlapping statistics on European securities 
holdings, the national central banks provide in -
formation in accordance with harmonised re -
quirements. For example, information available 
in the individual countries cannot be readily 
merged, which poses a challenge for the sec -
toral data. Securities owned by French banks 
and held in safe custody at German institutions 
may be recorded both indirectly (in the secur -
ities holdings statistics) and directly at the in -
vestor (in the statistics of the Banque de 
France). To rule out double- counting and, at 
the same time, to provide a largely complete 
overview of the European securities holdings 
structures, data reported directly are first col -
lected in the Securities Holdings Statistics Data -
base and the remaining data gaps are then 
closed using information that has been col -
lected indirectly. In the case of Germany, for ex -
ample, banks and investment funds have so far 
submitted direct reports of their securities hold -
ings; in all other sectors, such as insurance cor -
porations and pension funds, non- financial cor -porations, general government and house -
holds, data are collected indirectly through 
custodian banks.
A study of European sectoral data for the 
second quarter of 201425 shows a market value 
of €23,352 billion for the total security hold -
ings of investors resident in the euro area. The 
German contribution for domestic investors 
amounts to €5,423 billion.26 A breakdown of 
securities holdings by investor group into finan -
cial and non- financial sectors reveals that the 
share of the financial sector clearly predomin -
ates at more than 78% at the European level 
and 71% in Germany.
The standardisation of the reporting and sub -
mission schemes and the uniform compilation 
procedures of the Securities Holdings Statistics 
Database ensure a high degree of comparabil -
ity in European statistics. In addition, data qual -
ity is improved by merging information at the 
European level, as enhanced checks can be car -
ried out, which are not possible with purely na -Uniform rules

25 As this report went to press, the European sector data 
were available only up to the second quarter of 2014; this 
is therefore the observation period that has been examined 
here.

tional datasets. The higher degree of coverage 
provided by European securities holdings statis -
tics, in particular for indirectly collected sectoral 
data, is also of great significance. In this way, 
the collection of data by other central banks, 
for example in Belgium, Luxembourg or the 
Netherlands, can close data gaps for securities 
held by German non- financial corporations and 
households in other European countries.
The Securities Holdings Statistics Database 
allows a wide range of flexible analyses across 
Europe in strategically important and especially 
risky segments of the money and capital mar -
kets. For example, linking securities issued and 
held in the “who- to- whom” analyses provides 
detailed insights into the structure of securities 
holdings in the euro area and thus into rela -
tionships and dependencies in the European 
financial system. Symmetrical access by the en -
tire Eurosystem to all European securities hold -
ings data ultimately ensures a uniform informa -
tion base for decision- making processes on the 
European committees.
Outlook for the development 
of granular securities 
 holdings statistics
The planned enhancement of securities hold -
ings statistics in the ESCB is closely connected 
with the availability of other microdata. In fu -
ture, corporate data will be provided through 
the Register of Institutions and Affiliates Data -
base, for example, which allows additional 
analyses on issuers and investors; the Analytical 
Credit Dataset will create a European database system that provides a detailed picture of lend -
ing and borrowing.27 Connecting the informa -
tion on individual loans gained in this way with 
the granular securities data that become avail -
able will allow banking supervisors to identify 
debtors’ overall risks, for example. In order to 
ensure that loan and individual securities hold -
ings data can be analysed together in future, 
consideration is currently being given at the 
European level to expanding the reporting 
scheme for the group data of the securities 
holdings statistics and thus for securities hold -
ings statistics for Germany.
With the ongoing broadening of the micro 
database, the collection and application of 
statistical data in the ESCB will continue to 
change. Granular information can be collected 
once, stored centrally and used for various pur -
poses,28 irrespective of the statistical results to 
be compiled, following standardised proced -
ures across Europe. As a rule, it is possible to 
use information that is already available, which 
means that new requirements can be imple -
mented flexibly and within a narrow time 
frame. For a large number of users, the intro -
duction of harmonised microdata throughout 
Europe opens up the prospect of new analyt -
ical options and research perspectives.
