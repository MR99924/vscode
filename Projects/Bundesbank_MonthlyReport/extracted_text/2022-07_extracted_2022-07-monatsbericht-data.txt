Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic activity is likely to have more 
or less stagnated in the second quarter of 
2022. The elimination of most coronavirus miti -
gation measures lent a strong boost to previ -
ously beleaguered service providers and the re -
lated consumption expenditure. Hotel and res -
taurant sector revenues rose steeply on an 
average of April and May compared with the 
first quarter. According to the ifo Institute, the 
business situation of enterprises in the services 
sector (excluding trade) improved significantly 
overall in the spring. However, surging inflation 
weighed on households’ purchasing power; 
their propensity to consume was also adversely 
affected by uncertainty regarding the future 
energy supply. The consumer climate index cal -
culated by the market research institute GfK fell 
to a record low. The poor sentiment among 
consumers was reflected in substantially lower 
sales in retail and motor vehicle trade. Accord -
ing to ifo Institute surveys, shortages of mater -
ials and labour weighed on activity in the con -
struction sector. Industry continued to be con -
strained by supply bottlenecks and, moreover, 
suffered from high uncertainty about future 
economic developments and from weaker de -
mand – albeit starting from a high level. As a 
result, it was probably unable to maintain its 
first- quarter production levels. The consider -
able cutbacks in Russian gas deliveries since 
mid- June have been a major drag on enter -
prises and households, with gas prices sky -
rocketing as a result. This is also weighing on 
the outlook. In the current quarter, GDP growth 
is, from today’s perspective, likely to be some -
what weaker than expected in the baseline 
scenario of the Bundesbank’s June 2022 pro -
jection.1Industry
In May 2022, industrial production2 was up 
slightly on the month after seasonal adjust -
ment3 (+½%). It had already recovered some -
what in April from the distinct decline in March. 
This also applies to the production of motor 
vehicles  and motor vehicle parts, which had 
previously contracted particularly steeply. Ac -
cording to the German Association of the 
Automotive Industry, the number of passenger 
cars manufactured rose slightly in June as well. 
Survey results provided by the ifo Institute and 
S&P Global suggest that supply bottlenecks in 
industry have now receded somewhat follow -
ing the considerable exacerbation in March. On 
an average of April and May, industrial produc -
tion nevertheless remained markedly below its 
first- quarter level (-1¼%). Enterprises produced 
distinctly fewer intermediate and capital goods 
than in the previous quarter. In the case of 
intermediate goods, the decline was particu -
larly pronounced in the area of other non-  
metallic mineral products. This could have 
something to do with the sector’s pronounced 
dependence on gas and surging gas prices. By 
contrast, consumer goods production con -
tracted only slightly. However, isolated sectors, 
such as the pharmaceutical industry, experi -
enced sharp declines in production. Overall, in -
dustrial production remained significantly 
below the level prior to the outbreak of the 
coronavirus pandemic (-4½%).German eco -

1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022). However, according to 
the current assessment, the German economy is likely to be 
much closer to the baseline scenario than the adverse risk 
scenario described by the Bundesbank’s economists.
2 The time series for industrial production has been revised 
significantly. For example, the data for the economic sec -
tors and aggregates as from January 2021 were reworked 
as part of the regular annual revision. In addition, the 
method used to calculate the production index for the 
manufacture of motor vehicles was changed. The results 
for this sector were revised back to January 2015. See Fed -
eral Statistical Office (2022).

In May 2022, industrial new orders remained 
constant in seasonally adjusted terms, after de -
clining for three consecutive months. If large 
orders are excluded, however, they fell slightly. 
On an average of April and May, new orders 
decreased steeply compared with the first quar -
ter (-4¾%) and, excluding large orders, the de -
cline was distinctly weaker (-2¾%). Manufac -
turers of capital goods received considerably 
fewer orders. The mechanical engineering sec -
tor saw a slight uptick in orders, however. De -
mand for intermediate goods was down sig -
nificantly. By contrast, orders for consumer 
goods picked up substantially, although de -
mand for pharmaceutical products was consid -
erably lower. Broken down by region, new orders 
from non- euro area countries dropped sharply 
and those from euro area countries consider -
ably. Domestic orders dipped somewhat, too.
In May 2022, nominal industrial sales rose sub -
stantially on the previous month after seasonal 
adjustment (+3½%). On an average of April 
and May, they grew markedly (+2%) compared 
with the first quarter, although this was attrib -
utable to steep price increases. Broken down 
by region, nominal sales were up in the euro 
area and in Germany, in particular. By contrast, 
sales in non- euro area countries fell somewhat. 
Broken down by sector, sales of intermediate 
and consumer goods rose sharply, while slightly 
fewer capital goods were sold. After seasonal 
adjustment, nominal exports of goods were 
markedly higher in May 2022 compared with 
the previous month (+1½%). The increase was 
somewhat smaller after price adjustment 
(+1%). Nominal exports to the Russian Feder -
ation were up substantially but remained quite 
considerably below the level prior to the out -
break of the war in Ukraine. On an average of 
April and May, nominal exports of goods rose 
steeply compared with the first quarter (+5%). 
After price adjustment, however, the increase 
was significantly lower (+1¼%). Real exports of 
goods to euro area countries improved mark -
edly, while those to non- euro area countries 
were up only slightly. May saw a steep rise in 
nominal goods imports after seasonal adjust -Industrial new

ment (+3½%), and even after price adjustment 
there was a clear increase (+2½%). As a result 
of the sanctions, nominal imports from Russia 
fell considerably once again, however. Taking 
the average for April and May, nominal imports 
of goods were up sharply compared with the 
first quarter (+9½%). This growth was signifi -
cantly lower after price adjustment due to sur -
ging import prices (+3¼%). The increase is at -
tributable primarily to imports from non- euro 
area countries, although slightly more goods 
were imported from the euro area, too. Broken 
down by product category, imports of chemical 
products, in particular, were higher.
Construction
After adjustment for seasonal variations, out -
put in the construction sector increased slightly 
in May 2022 when compared with the previous 
month (+½%). On an average of April and May, 
however, sales were down markedly on the 
first quarter (-2%), with production in the main 
construction sector considerably below its first- 
quarter level. By contrast, the finishing sector 
saw only a slight drop in output. One factor 
contributing to the decline in construction out -
put to a certain extent is likely to have been the 
favourable weather in the first quarter, which 
has now led to a countermovement. In add -
ition, shortages of labour and materials prob -
ably intensified considerably compared with 
the winter quarter as is indicated by ifo Insti -
tute surveys among enterprises in the main 
construction sector. Signs of relief have been 
appearing recently, however. New orders in the 
main construction sector declined substantially 
in April – the latest month for which data are 
available  – compared with the first quarter. 
Nevertheless, the order situation in construc -
tion is expected to be favourable. Although the 
reach of the order books as determined by ifo 
Institute surveys declined slightly in June, it re -
mained high in a long- term comparison. Util -
isation of equipment declined for the fourth 
consecutive month, but was still well above its 
long- term average.Labour market
The seasonally adjusted rise in employment in 
May, in which the number of persons in em -
ployment increased by 35,000, was once again 
less pronounced than in the previous month. In 
addition to the relatively weak spring pick- up 
following a mild winter, increasing strains from 
the war on Ukraine and the – in part related – 
high energy prices and supply bottlenecks for 
intermediate goods are likely to be making 
themselves felt. However, it is also becoming 
increasingly difficult to fill vacancies in some 
areas of the services sector. According to an ini -
tial estimate by the Federal Employment 
Agency, the increase in employment subject to 
social security contributions was already rather 
weak in April. The use of cyclical short- time 
working declined further in April, with the 
number of new registrations for short- time 
work, in fact, exceptionally low in June. Other 
leading indicators of enterprises’ hiring inten -
tions are pointing to increasingly weaker job 
growth in the coming months.
Following an almost uninterrupted decline for 
two years, registered unemployment rose 
steeply in June. In seasonally adjusted terms, 
the number of unemployed persons increased 
by 133,000 to 2.42 million. The unemployment 
rate was up by 0.3 percentage point to 5.3%. 
This can be explained mainly by the incorpor -
ation of Ukrainian refugees into the social 
security system with effect from June. Once 
they have received benefits for three months 
under the Act on Benefits Granted to Persons 
Seeking Asylum (Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz), 
they are recorded as unemployed if they are 
classified as being fit and available for work. As 
a result, in the vast majority of cases, these per -
sons now receive the basic allowance for job 
seekers. According to the Federal Employment 
Agency, however, unemployment rose slightly 
even without the effect described above. This is 
likely to be due to the rather weak spring re -
bound and active labour market policy meas -
ures mitigating unemployment to a smaller ex -Slight rise in

tent.4 It is also possible that unemployment 
might continue to rise over the coming months. 
The IAB unemployment barometer moved from 
positive to negative territory in June; however, 
the informative value of this indicator in eco -
nomic terms is impaired by refugee movements.
Prices
Prices on the international energy markets in 
June 2022 were characterised by countervailing 
trends. Brent crude oil cost just under US$110 
per barrel at last report, and thus slightly lower 
than at the end of May. By contrast, natural gas 
prices in Europe surged once again. This is likely 
to be largely due to supply shortages and con -
cerns that Russia might halt gas deliveries al -
together. The cost of a megawatt hour doubled 
from just over €80 at the beginning of June to 
around €170 at the end of the period under re -
view.
Overall, price increases at the upstream stages 
of the economy remained near the all- time 
high levels of the preceding months. Import 
prices increased by 31% in May compared with 
the previous year, just under 1  percentage 
point less than in March and April. At the do -
mestic producer level, prices were up by 34%, 
which was roughly in line with the April figure. 
At both stages, price pressures for energy and 
intermediate goods were slightly weaker, while 
prices of consumer goods and capital goods 
once again accelerated.
The rate of consumer price inflation fell some -
what from a very high level as this report went 
to press. In June, the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP) rose by 8.2% on the year, 
0.5 percentage point lower than in May.5 This 
was mainly due to public transport becoming 
significantly cheaper as a result of the tempor -
ary introduction of the €9 ticket.6 Seasonally 
adjusted month- on- month inflation, at -0.1%, 
was likewise negative at the end of the period 
under review. Although energy prices con -
tinued to rise very sharply, inflation did not in -crease any further. This is likely to have been 
due, at least in part, to the temporary fuel re -
bate.7 By contrast, food price inflation con -
tinued to accelerate sharply, while price pres -
sures for industrial goods remained unchanged 
at their high level. The inflation rate is set to re -
main high over the next few months. It could 
even climb further in September with the expiry 
of temporary relief measures. However, the fu -
ture trajectory of the energy commodity mar -
kets is very uncertain, especially with regard to 
natural gas deliveries from Russia. The risks to 
the price outlook are clearly tilted to the up -
side.
Public finances8
Local government finances
Local governments (core budgets and off-  
budget entities) closed the first quarter of this 
year with a seasonal deficit, as usual. At €5½ 
billion, it was €3½ billion lower than in the first 
quarter of 2021. Local governments financed 
€2 billion of the deficit by taking on new debt 
(according to the provisional debt statistics). 
They were able to cover the lion’s share by 
making recourse to the reserves, which 
stemmed – in part – from the high surplus in 
the final quarter of 2021.Surging natural

Agency (2022), p. 13.
5 The national consumer price index (CPI) showed an in -
crease of 7.6%, compared with 7.9% in May.
6 The effects of the €9 ticket can be seen in the HICP com -
ponent “Combined passenger transport” (0735). Here, 
prices fell by 62.9% on the year in June, after having risen 
by as much as 1.7% in May. Taking into account the cur -
rent HICP weight of the sub- component, which stands at 
1.1%, the HICP rate in June was dampened by around 
0.7 percentage point.
7 In early June, the bulk of the fuel rebate is likely to have 
been passed through to consumers. In the course of the 
month, the effect of the fuel rebate was probably then 
overshadowed by fluctuations in the price of crude oil as 
well as in the exchange rate.
8 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

Revenue rose very sharply on the year, by 12% 
(+€7 billion). At 26%, tax receipts even grew 
more than twice as strongly (+€4½ billion). 
After deducting shares accruing to other gov -
ernment levels, local business tax – a large rev -
enue item – increased by 25%. Local govern -
ments in Rhineland- Palatinate, in particular,  
benefited from this, as a vaccine manufacturer 
is based in this federal state. Local government 
shares in income tax doubled, rising by €1 bil -
lion. This is likely to be related to state govern -
ments’ final settlements for 2021. Transfers 
from state government also saw strong growth 
(+7%, or €2 billion). Receipts from fees went 
up by 11%. Protective pandemic measures are 
likely to have had less of a restricting effect on 
facilities’ operations than in the same quarter 
of the previous year.
Expenditure increased significantly, by 6%. Per -
sonnel expenditure climbed particularly sharply 
(+8%), partly on account of a special effect in 
Baden-  Württemberg. Other operating expend -
iture also rose substantially (+7%). Spending on 
social benefits, by contrast, increased only 
moderately, at 2%. On the one hand, the pub -
lic long- term care insurance scheme has put a 
limit on the co- contribution rate of care recipi -
ents in care homes since the beginning of the 
year, easing the burden on social assistance. 
On the other hand, spending on benefits for 
asylum seekers increased. Expenditure on refu -
gees from Ukraine probably only started to in -
crease close to the end of the quarter. Fixed 
asset formation rose by 3½%. This was mainly 
attributable to construction investment (+5%). 
The growth in this and other operating ex -
penditure is likely to broadly reflect strong price 
increases.
As things currently stand, a surplus is to be ex -
pected again for the year as a whole. For ex -
ample, the March projection issued by the Fed -
eral Ministry of Finance for the Stability Council 
–  updated to reflect the May tax estimate  – 
suggests a similarly high surplus as in 2021 
(+€4½ billion). Additional central government 
funds of €2 billion are intended to cover the additional costs incurred by local governments 
for spending on refugees from Ukraine. How -
ever, uncertainty is great, with high energy 
prices being a key factor. These also weigh on 
local government via local utilities companies; 
aside from lower profit distributions, local au -
thorities may also have to step in to offset 
losses, under certain circumstances. The macro -
economic risks mainly affect local government 
through volatile local business tax, which is a 
large revenue item. A fundamental reform of 
local government finances remains advisable in 
order to ensure stable and commensurate 
funding of local government budgets.9 This 
seems particularly important in order to enable 
governments to reinforce their infrastructure.Strong revenue

Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) recorded a deficit of just 
over €2 billion in the first quarter of 2022. It 
had posted a slight surplus in the first quarter 
of 2021.10 Excluding positive one- off effects, 
however, the deficit would have been some -
what higher last year than in the current year.
The health fund posted a deficit of just over €2 
billion in the first quarter of 2022. A small sur -plus was recorded in the same quarter of the 
previous year, which was due to pre- funding by 
central government. Contribution receipts grew 
by just over 4½% compared with the same 
quarter last year. Around one- half of a percent -
age point of this was attributable to the slight 
increase in the average supplementary contri -
bution rates. The fund also received special 
grants of €9½ billion from central government 
for its pandemic-  related special expenditure in 
the first quarter, not only on the very substan -
tial expansion of public coronavirus tests, but 
also for financial assistance to hospitals total -
ling €4 billion and vaccination costs of €1½ bil -
lion. The health fund’s other expenditure rose 
steeply, by 7%. This was driven by the fact that 
central government increased its annual trans -
fers to the health insurance institutions in order 
to stabilise the supplementary contribution 
rates.
As in the same quarter of the previous year, the 
health insurance institutions achieved a largely 
balanced result. Total revenue saw strong growth 
of 6½%, particularly on account of higher cen -
tral government funds. The health insurance in -
stitutions’ expenditure also increased by 6½%, 
including a 6% rise in spending on benefits. 
Particular growth was seen in those areas 
where the previous year’s figures had been de -
pressed on account of the pandemic. Expend -
iture on remedies and therapeutic appliances 
(+14%) and pharmaceuticals (+6½%), above 
all, rose strongly. Spending on hospital treat -
ment – a major expenditure item – also climbed 
markedly, by 4½%.11 Expenditure on medical 
treatments increased by a more moderate 
2½%, following high growth in the previous 
year. Administrative expenditure grew by a very 
substantial 18%. Adjusted for higher pension SHI scheme:

10 In 2021, reserves of €8 billion were redistributed among 
the institutions via the health fund. The associated pay -
ment flows did not influence either the financial situation 
of the SHI scheme as a whole or that of its two constituent 
parts taken in isolation. The revenue and expenditure de -
velopments described in the following are therefore ad -
justed for these payment flows.
11 Together with the aforementioned assistance from the 
health fund, payments from the SHI system to hospitals 
thus rose strongly by 8% at the start of the year.Deutsche Bundesbank

provisions, however, it rose only to a limited ex -
tent. Excluding higher pension provisions, the 
institutions recorded a modest surplus.
In its autumn 2021 forecast, the group of SHI 
estimators assumed a deficit of €2 billion in the 
SHI system for 2022 as a whole (including the 
total additional central government grant to 
the health insurance institutions in the amount 
of €14 billion). The deficit was expected in the 
health fund: in the current year, it will pass on 
€2 billion from its reserves to the institutions. 
From the current perspective, by contrast, it 
seems the health fund could perform better, 
achieving a balanced result. In view of develop-
ments to date, for instance, revenue could be 
considerably higher than expected. However, 
there are substantial macroeconomic risks with regard to the second half of the year.
Given an unchanged overall contribution rate, 
the group of SHI estimators anticipated a bal -
anced result for the health insurance institu -
tions. The financial resources from the health 
fund’s reserves and the additional central gov -
ernment grant closed a funding gap of €16 bil -
lion. From the current perspective, the health insurance institutions could also perform bet -
ter, thus recording a surplus. Expenditure could 
be somewhat lower than expected back in the 
autumn, for instance. Furthermore, the actual 
average supplementary contribution rate is just 
under 0.1 percentage point higher than previ -
ously anticipated.
The statutory health insurance scheme is set to 
face considerable challenges over the coming 
years, however. It is already structurally under -
funded at present. This is likely to be exacer -
bated in the future as expenditure tends to rise 
more strongly than income subject to contribu -
tions. A financial reform of the statutory health 
insurance scheme is currently being discussed 
that would entail the predominantly structural 
deficit of 1 contribution rate point in 2023 
(equivalent to around €16 billion) being covered 
with a combination of measures. The Federal 
Minister of Health anticipates an increase in the average supplementary contribution rate of 
0.3 percentage point. In order to limit contribu -
tion rate rises on this scale, Federal Govern -
ment plans to make a one-  off payment of an  
additional €3 billion, including a loan of €1 bil-
lion by the end of 2026. Available health fund 
and health insurance institution reserves are also to be used. In total, these reserves are 
roughly twice as high as the special funds from 
central government. Various savings on the 
benefits side could, for a time, provide as much relief as the special funds from central govern -
ment. Overall, this will close the expected 
financing gap next year. However, as the meas -
ures announced are mainly temporary in na -
ture, the government would just be putting off taking necessary action.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €137.6 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2022 was up slightly on 
the previous month’s figure (€129.0 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which were 
lower than in the previous month, and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €23.9 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany rose by €0.7 billion during the report -
ing month, boosting the outstanding volume 
of debt instruments in the German market by 
€24.6 billion overall.
The public sector issued debt securities to the 
tune of €14.9 billion net in the reporting 
month, compared with €0.2 billion in April. On 
balance, central government was the main is -
suer of new securities (€13.9 billion), placing 
above all 10-  year and 30-  year Federal bonds in 
the market (Bunds: €8.5 billion and €4.0 bil -
lion, respectively), but also two-  y ear Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze: €6.2 billion) and five-

worth €1.0 billion net.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €4.9 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with €0.7 billion in April. On bal -
ance, non- financial corporations were the chief 
issuers.
Domestic credit institutions raised their capital 
market debt by €4.1 billion net in May, follow -
ing net redemptions of €3.2 billion in April. The 
outstanding volume of debt securities issued by 
specialised credit institutions – which include, 
for example, public promotional banks – went 
up by €1.8 billion, thereby accounting for the 
bulk of the increase. Further growth was also 
seen in the outstanding volume of mortgage 
Pfandbriefe (€1.3 billion), of other bank debt 
securities that can be structured flexibly (€0.7 
billion) and of public Pfandbriefe (€0.3 billion).The Bundesbank was the main buyer of bonds 
in May, acquiring debt securities amounting to 
€14.4 billion net, predominantly under the Eu -
rosystem’s asset purchase programmes. Do -
mestic non- banks purchased debt securities 
worth €8.3 billion net. On balance, these pur -
chases solely involved domestic paper issued by 
the private sector. Domestic credit institutions 
expanded their bond portfolios by €5.5 billion 
net, while non- resident investors disposed of 
domestic debt securities worth €3.6 billion net.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €1.4 billion net in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market rose by €2.5 bil -
lion over the same period. On balance, shares 
were purchased chiefly by domestic non- banks 
(€3.0 billion), but domestic credit institutions 
were likewise active in the market (€1.6 billion). 
By contrast, foreign investors reduced their 
equity exposure in Germany by €0.7 billion net.
Mutual funds
In May, German mutual funds recorded net in -
flows of €5.1 billion (April: €9.3 billion). On bal -
ance, specialised funds reserved for institu -
tional investors were the chief beneficiaries of 
such inflows (€4.0 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, the main sellers of new shares 
were open- end real estate funds and equity 
funds (€1.6 billion and €0.8 billion, respect -
ively). The outstanding volume of foreign mu -
tual fund units distributed in Germany rose by 
€0.7 billion in the reporting month. In May, do -
mestic non- banks purchased mutual fund 
shares worth €5.2 billion net. Foreign investors 
bought German shares for €0.6 billion net, 
while domestic credit institutions scaled back 
their fund portfolio slightly (-€0.1 billion).Enterprises’

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €2.5 billion in May 2022, down €6.4 billion 
on the previous month’s level. Although the 
surplus in the goods account increased, this 
was outweighed by the sharp shift into a deficit 
for invisible current transactions, which com -
prise services as well as primary and secondary 
income.
In May, the surplus in the goods account grew 
by €1.9 billion on the month to €6.2 billion, 
but this was due to the rise in net goods ex -
ports in merchanting trade and the decline in 
net imports of non- monetary gold. In foreign 
trade, however, imports increased somewhat 
more strongly than exports.
Invisible current transactions shifted from a sur -
plus of €4.6 billion in April to a deficit of €3.7 
billion in May. This was primarily attributable to 
the decline in net receipts in primary income by 
€8.3 billion to €2.2 billion, with higher dividend 
payments to non- residents from portfolio in -
vestment playing a key role. Furthermore, the 
deficit in the services account widened by €1.5 
billion to €2.7 billion. Expenditure expanded 
more strongly than receipts, especially as travel 
expenditure picked up as is usual at this time of 
year. By contrast, the deficit in the secondary 
income account narrowed by €1.5 billion to 
€3.2 billion. Higher general government tax 
revenue from non- residents owing to the 
higher dividend payments on portfolio invest -
ments in particular contributed to this de -
crease.
In May 2022, as in previous months, financial 
markets continued to be influenced by Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and rising inflation rates. 
Germany’s cross- border portfolio investment 
generated net capital exports of €6.5 billion 
(April: €11.1 billion). Domestic investors added 
€2.9 billion worth of securities issued by non-  
residents to their portfolios on balance. They 
purchased foreign bonds (€5.5 billion), shares 
(€1.5 billion) and mutual fund shares (€0.7 bil -Current account

Distributional Wealth Accounts for house -
holds in Germany – results and use cases
Previously, it was not possible to describe the wealth distribution of households in Germany at the 
level of individual households on a quarterly basis. Now, however, the Distributional Wealth 
Accounts (DWA) represent a new provisional dataset that combines two data perspectives: 
namely, they link the Bundesbank’s Panel on Household Finances (PHF) with the national accounts 
statistics. The DWA thus incorporate the distributional information from the household survey and 
simultaneously reflect the quarterly dynamics and levels of the national accounts statistics in a 
consistent manner.
According to the DWA, wealth inequality has declined in recent years. One reason for this is that 
net wealth has grown particularly strongly for households in the bottom half of the distribution 
of wealth, albeit from a low level. These less wealthy households have accumulated a significant 
volume of low- risk assets, such as deposits and insurance claims, and at the same time consider -
ably reduced their debt. Another reason for decreasing inequality is that households in the upper 
mid- range of the distribution benefited noticeably from the rising value of their housing wealth. 
Furthermore, the DWA reveal considerable heterogeneity in the composition of households’ 
wealth. In the less wealthy half of the distribution, this wealth consists almost exclusively of low- 
risk assets. By contrast, the wealth structure of more wealthy households includes a much greater 
volume of capital market instruments and, above all, housing and business wealth.
As housing wealth, in particular, generated a high return alongside shares, the average real 
return on assets from 2009 to the beginning of 2022 was significantly higher in the top half of 
the wealth distribution than in the bottom half. In this connection, the results also show that the 
yield- lowering effect of inflation is especially noticeable at the lower tail of the wealth distribu -
tion. As these households chiefly hold low- yielding assets, high inflation rates consequently lead 
to negative real returns on their wealth in particular.
The dataset presented here is also likely to become more relevant to monetary policy in future. 
Multiple studies show that heterogeneity among households can affect the transmission of mon -
etary policy. Thus, the way in which monetary policy measures work is also likely to depend on 
the distribution and structure of wealth. When assessing the impact of such measures, then, it 
generally makes sense to bear in mind the financial differences between households. It is precisely 
against this backdrop that the future provision of the DWA would appear to be particularly help -
ful for a central bank.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
With the Distributional Wealth Accounts (DWA) 
for households in Germany, there now exists a 
new provisional dataset that merges two differ -
ent sources of information by linking the data 
from the Bundesbank’s Panel on Household 
Finances (PHF) with the quarterly data from the 
national accounts statistics. These DWA enable 
analyses to be carried out at the level of indi -
vidual households. In concrete terms, this 
means that decisive statements can be made 
on wealth and debt developments along the 
wealth distribution. Since the effectiveness of 
monetary and economic policy measures de -
pends, amongst other things, on the distribu -
tion and structure of wealth and any potential 
associated balance sheet constraints, the provi -
sion of distributional statistics such as these 
seems particularly helpful for central banks. The 
dataset is still in the development phase, but 
significant progress has already been made. Po -
tential adjustments as the process continues 
cannot be ruled out.
This article starts by providing an overview of 
the process of creating the DWA for house -
holds in Germany. In addition, it analyses the 
development of the distribution of wealth since 
2009 in a stylised form. It goes on to determine 
portfolio returns at the individual household 
level and to analyse their development over 
time using the DWA. Finally, economic policy 
conclusions are drawn. The overall findings are 
as follows:
– The DWA provide higher- frequency and 
comparatively timely data on the distribution 
of various assets and liabilities across house -
holds in Germany.
– According to the DWA, wealth inequality 
has decreased since around 2014. This is 
due, for one thing, to the fact that aside 
from building up their financial assets sub -
stantially, the bottom half of the wealth dis -
tribution reduced their debt to a significant 
extent, thus contributing to an increase in net wealth. For another, the upper mid-  
range of the distribution benefited percep -
tibly from an increase in the value of hous -
ing wealth.
– The data from the DWA also indicate that 
there are significant differences in the com -
position of households’ wealth along the 
wealth distribution. For example, the assets 
held by households in the bottom half of the 
distribution consist almost exclusively of 
low- risk forms of investment, such as de -
posits and insurance claims. By contrast, the 
wealth structure of more wealthy house -
holds includes a much greater volume of 
capital market instruments and, above all, 
housing and business wealth.
– The interaction between the different wealth 
structures and the varying returns on the in -
dividual asset types is reflected in noticeable 
differences in the level of the return on total 
assets along the wealth distribution. As 
housing wealth, in particular, generated a 
high return alongside shares, the average 
real return on assets from 2009 to the be -
ginning of 2022 was significantly higher in 
the top half of the wealth distribution than 
in the bottom half.
Distributional wealth accounts   
for households in Germany: 
some stylised results 
The DWA are characterised by the fact that 
they combine distributional information with 
the national accounts statistics in a consistent 
manner and make this available on a quarterly 
basis. Two sets of statistics are of key import -
ance when compiling the DWA. First, the data 
from the Bundesbank’s PHF study are con -
sidered. In this study, individual households in 
Germany are asked about their wealth and DWA link

their debt.1 Second, data from the national ac -
counts statistics are incorporated. The national 
accounts statistics describe the total wealth 
and wealth structure of the institutional sectors 
as a whole – i.e. also for the entire household 
sector in Germany. They include non- financial 
assets as determined by the Federal Statistical 
Office and the data on financial assets and 
liabilities compiled by the Bundesbank. How -
ever, the national accounts statistics do not 
allow for any statements to be made about the 
distribution of wealth. By contrast, the data 
from the PHF study provide very detailed infor -
mation at the level of individual households, al -
beit only at intervals of around three years. In 
turn, the national accounts statistics predomin -
antly record aggregate household wealth on a 
quarterly basis.2
Although both sets of statistics are compiled 
with the same aim in mind – that is, to describe 
the wealth situation of German households – 
there is a considerable gap in wealth reporting 
between the aggregated microdata of the PHF 
study (extrapolated) and the national accounts 
statistics (for more on this, see the adjacent 
chart). A key contributing factor here is the in -
adequate coverage of very wealthy households 
in the PHF study. Against this backdrop, experts 
from the European System of Central Banks 
collaborating in various expert groups have, 
since 2015, endeavoured to link the data from 
household surveys with the national accounts 
statistics for the household sector within a con -
sistent analytical framework, thereby closing 
the data gaps (see also the box on pp. 18 ff.).3
Ultimately, the provisional dataset resulting 
from the work of the expert groups contains 
valuable information from both sets of statis -
tics: it takes into account the distributional in -
formation from the household wealth survey at 
the individual household level, as well as the 
quarterly dynamics and levels of the national 
accounts statistics for the period since 2009. In 
this context, the DWA record level data on the 
basis of various wealth groupings for the fol -
lowing types of assets and liabilities: deposits, debt securities, listed shares, investment funds, 
insurance claims, financial and non- financial 
business wealth, housing wealth and liabilities 
in the form of mortgages and other debt.4 
Financial business wealth includes equity in -
vestments, i.e. unlisted shares and other equity. 
Non- financial business wealth, on the other 
hand, chiefly consists of the non- financial 
assets of sole proprietors such as self- employed 
persons and freelancers.5 The net wealth of a 
household is ultimately calculated as the differ -
ence between total assets and liabilities (see 
also the chart on p. 21).… close the gap

households in Germany. On average, data for around 
4,000 households are available for each of the three exist -
ing survey waves of the PHF. These data make it possible to 
analyse a multitude of topics: income and wealth distribu -
tion, property ownership, saving behaviour and provision 
for old age, jobs, and family. In addition, the PHF data feed 
into the Household Finance and Consumption Survey, a 
study conducted by the Eurosystem central banks, and thus 
play a key role at not only the national but also the Euro -
pean level.

Accounts for households in Germany
There are currently two key sets of Bundes-
bank statistics which provide information 
on the wealth situation of households in 
Germany. First, there is the Panel on House-
hold Finances (PHF), which gives detailed 
information on the individual wealth and 
debt situation of the households surveyed. 
Second, the national accounts statistics pro-
vide aggregate information on the amount 
and structure of wealth of the entire house-
hold sector. As both sets of statistics focus 
on household wealth in Germany, it might 
initially be assumed that they provide simi-
lar aggregate wealth fi  gures. However, a 
simplifi  ed comparison of the data from the 
wealth survey and the national accounts 
statistics reveals signifi  cant differences (see 
also the chart below). An expert group 
within the European System of Central Banks 
(ESCB) identifi  ed two main sets of factors 
that explain these differences.1
The fi  rst set of factors mainly concerns con-
ceptual and methodological differences. 
These can potentially relate to individual or 
all components of wealth, and include dif-
ferences in the defi  nition of the population 
or periodicity and timeliness of the statis-tics. However, differing valuation concepts 
between the two sets of statistics are also 
a decisive factor. For example, the survey 
data typically reflect household self- 
evaluations of different assets and liabilities, 
whereas the national accounts statistics 
primarily  measure assets on the basis of 
market values. Finally, when comparing the 
data, it should be borne in mind that 
wealthy households are typically underrep-
resented in the realised samples of the 
wealth survey.
The second set of factors relates to 
instrument- specifi  c differences, which are 
mainly due to divergent defi  nitions. In order 
to take account of these conceptual differ-
ences in particular, the Distributional Wealth 
Accounts include only those wealth com-
1 In December 2015, the Expert Group on Linking 
Macro and Micro Data for the household sector (EG- 
LMM) was established within the ESCB with the aim of 
analysing the comparability of data from the house-
hold wealth survey and the national accounts statis-
tics. Based on these results, the expert group which 
succeeded it (Expert Group on Distributional Financial 
Accounts) was then tasked with developing a proced-
ure for the compilation of the Distributional Wealth 
Accounts.

ponents which are suffi   ciently comparable 
between the two sets of statistics. They do 
not, however, include those wealth pos-
itions that are only recorded in one of the 
two sources, such as “non- life insurance 
reserves ”, which only form part of the 
fi  nancial accounts. They also exclude assets 
which have a low degree of comparability 
owing to signifi  cant differences in how they 
are defi  ned. These include occupational 
pensions, fi  nancial derivatives and other ac-
counts receivable/ payable. Ultimately, this 
approach results in a defi  nition of wealth 
which –  as measured by the national ac-
counts statistics  – covers around 90% of 
households’ total assets.2
Despite using an adjusted concept of wealth, 
when it comes to net wealth there is still a 
notable gap between the aggregate of the 
household survey and the corresponding 
data from the national accounts statistics. 
On average, the net wealth recorded in the 
household survey over the three PHF waves 
is around €2,000 billion (20%) lower than 
the level in the national accounts statistics. 
A major contributing factor here is the ab-
sence of very wealthy households in the 
PHF, which continues to present a great 
challenge.3 For one thing, only a small num-
ber of high- net- worth households are rep-
resented in the population. For another, willingness to participate in surveys de-
creases as net wealth increases.4
An advanced approach was developed to 
close the data gap for this population group 
2 It should be noted here that for fi  nancial business 
wealth (sub- component of total business wealth), the 
corresponding level in the fi  nancial accounts (sum of 
unlisted shares and other equity held) appears to be 
recorded only incompletely. Stylised back- of- an- 
envelope calculations indicate that unlisted shares and 
other equity issued by non- fi  nancial corporations in 
Germany are underreported in the fi  nancial accounts. 
Accordingly, the reported volume for these two instru-
ments is likely to be around €1,250  billion too low 
overall. Thus, when compiling the Distributional 
Wealth Accounts, an appropriately corrected level in 
the fi  nancial accounts is used. It is estimated that 
around 90% of German enterprises are family- owned 
(see Foundation for Family Businesses (2019)). Assum-
ing that most of the aforementioned liabilities are held 
by households, this would imply a correction factor of 
4.8 for households’ holdings in 2017 with regard to 
these two wealth components. To obtain a time series 
for the correction factor, it is also assumed that the ori-
ginal stock was largely recorded correctly in 1991, im-
plying a correction factor of 1. On the basis of these 
two data points, a time series for the correction factor 
can be computed using linear interpolation/ extrapola-
tion. Finally, multiplying the raw fi  gure from the fi  nan-
cial accounts by this time series yields an appropriately 
corrected value. For more on the underreporting of ag-
gregate business wealth, see also Albers et al. (2020).
3 See European Central Bank (2020).
4 See, for example, Westermeier and Grabka (2015). It 
should be noted, however, that the Socio- Economic 
Panel (SOEP) was able to signifi  cantly improve the data 
situation in this area of the net wealth distribution by 
means of a new additional sample (SOEP- P) concerned 
with high wealth (see Schröder et al. (2020)).Stylised wealth distribution*

as much as possible. The idea behind this 
approach is to add the absent very wealthy 
households to the original household sur-
vey dataset using a “rich list”.5 The observa-
tions on net wealth from this list supple-
ment the PHF dataset. Since these data only 
take into account the top tail of the net 
wealth distribution, synthetic wealthy 
households are also estimated which then 
supplement the original PHF dataset as 
well. The net wealth of these synthetic 
households lies between that of the mem-
bers of the rich list and the wealthiest 
households included in the wealth survey 
(see also the chart on p. 19).6
As the data on the added wealthy house-
holds all relate to net wealth, further adjust-
ments are needed at the level of the individ-
ual wealth components in order to close 
the data gaps. The bulk of the gap in liabil-
ities is attributed to very wealthy house-
holds. This allocation is based on two as-
sumptions: fi  rst, that very wealthy house-
holds have access to generally large- volume 
credit contracts; and, second, that the liabil-
ities of comparatively less wealthy house-
holds are adequately captured in the PHF.7 
Now that data on liabilities are available 
alongside net wealth, the level of gross 
wealth can be determined. The compos-
ition of gross wealth is based on the results 
of an additional SOEP-P sample and the 
2018 Global Family Offi   ce Report.8 This 
composition is ultimately assigned to very 
wealthy households as an initial portfolio 
structure.9 In the event that the added 
households now hold certain assets on a 
larger scale than suggested by the data 
gaps, further adjustments are made. In con-
crete terms, this means that excess holdings 
are spread across comparable assets which 
are still underreported.10 The portfolios of 
the synthetic households and rich list house-
holds generated in this way thus comple-
ment the original data from the wealth sur-
vey. It is shown that simply by adding the 
very wealthy households that have so far 
been absent from the data, the underre-porting when it comes to total net wealth 
can be reduced by more than 50% on aver-
age.11 The remaining data gaps are fi  nally 
closed by means of proportional allocation, 
whereby each household is allocated part 
of the remaining data gap according to its 
share in the instrument- specifi  c volume re-
5 Specifi  cally, data provided by “manager magazin” on 
the net wealth of the wealthiest Germans in 2011, 
2014 and 2017 are used.
6 This is done under the assumption that the wealth of 
very affl   uent households follows a Pareto distribution. 
The Pareto distribution is estimated on the basis of the 
PHF households whose net wealth exceeds €1 million 
and the wealth data from the rich list. Using this esti-
mated distribution, synthetic households which lie in 
the unobserved range are then randomly drawn and 
added with a corresponding level of net wealth. For 
more on the approximation of the wealth distribution 
using Pareto distribution in the high- wealth range, see, 
inter alia, Vermeulen (2018) and the sources cited 
therein, as well as Waltl and Chakraborty (2022).
7 Liabilities are allocated to very wealthy households 
proportionally to net wealth, subject to the constraint 
that the later structure of gross wealth essentially 
matches the portfolio structure of millionaires in 
the SOEP- P . For more on the wealth structure in the 
SOEP-P  , see Schröder et al. (2020).
8 See Schröder et al. (2020) and UBS/ Campden Re-
search (2018).
9 According to UBS/ Campden Research (2018), the fol-
lowing portfolio structure is assumed: deposits (7.0%), 
debt securities (16.2%), listed shares (28.0%), invest-
ment funds (5.7%), fi  nancial business wealth (21.6%), 
housing wealth (18.1%), non- fi  nancial business wealth 
(3.4%). Taking into account the SOEP- P data, the port-
folio shares of housing wealth and total business 
wealth are adjusted to 20% and 60% respectively. The 
remaining portfolio shares are rescaled accordingly, so 
that the sum of all shares equals 100%. This ultimately 
produces an initial portfolio composition which essen-
tially refl  ects the results of the SOEP- P and serves as a 
benchmark.
10 Thus, for example, excess holdings of debt secur-
ities are distributed equally across investment funds 
and insurance claims. This refl  ects the fact that house-
holds can invest in debt securities indirectly via invest-
ment funds and life insurance. Similarly, excess hold-
ings of listed shares are assigned to business wealth 
as well as to investment funds and insurance claims. 
Finally , excess holdings of housing wealth are distrib-
uted among shares, business wealth, investment funds 
and insurance claims.
11 Given average aggregate net wealth of around 
€10 trillion recorded across all three existing PHF sur-
vey waves, the data gap amounts to an average of 
roughly €2 trillion. By adding synthetically produced 
households to the original data from the household 
survey, this gap can be closed by an average of more 
than 50%.Deutsche Bundesbank

The chart on p. 22 shows the respective level 
of net wealth and the share in total net wealth 
for different groupings of households along the 
net wealth distribution. Specifically, the re -
spective aggregate net wealth of four wealth 
groupings is considered: the top 1% of the 
wealth distribution, the next 9% of the distri -
bution (90% to 99%), the 40% after that (50% 
to 90%) and the bottom half of the wealth dis -
tribution (0% to 50%). The DWA for the house -
hold sector show a high level of overall wealth 
inequality, although this has declined slightly 
over the duration of the dataset (from 2009 
onwards, in other words). While the top 10% 
of the wealth distribution held more than 50% 
of German households’ total net wealth over 
the observation period, the bottom half of the 
wealth distribution accounted for an extremely 
small share, averaging 0.6%. However, the dis -
tribution has shifted slightly in favour of the 
bottom half of the distribution over the obser -
vation period. The share of total net wealth 
held by the less wealthy 50% of households Breakdown 
of household 
groupings along 
net wealth 
distribution  …corded so far.12 This leads to an instrument- 
specifi  c increase in holdings across all 
households, which ultimately enables full 
alignment of the wealth survey with the na-
tional accounts statistics.
After linking the three existing PHF survey 
waves to the relevant data from the na-
tional accounts statistics, interpolation and 
extrapolation are used in the fi  nal step to 
translate the dynamics from the national 
accounts statistics to the individual house-
holds. The resulting dataset therefore con-
sistently takes into account not only the dis-
tributional information from the wealth sur-
vey but also fully includes the levels and the 
quarterly dynamics of the national accounts 
statistics for the period since 2009.13 Finally, 
however, it should be noted that the data 
at the current end, in particular, are subject 
to some degree of uncertainty owing to the 
extrapolation process. In this context, the 
extrapolation of the individual household data after the last available PHF survey wave 
from 2017 implicitly assumes that the sav-
ing and investment behaviour of house-
holds observed up to that point has not 
fundamentally changed. This simplifying as-
sumption can be problematic, as crisis situ-
ations such as the coronavirus pandemic 
can, in principle, permanently change 
households’ motives for saving and thus 
also their saving and investment behav-
iour.14
12 In this context, the advantage of proportional allo-
cation is that, at the instrument level, it does not skew 
the distributional information generated up to that 
point in any specifi  c direction but leaves it unchanged.
13 On average, data for around 4,000 households are 
available for the three existing PHF surveys. In addition, 
there are another 3,000 very wealthy households 
which are artifi  cially generated on the basis of an esti-
mated Pareto distribution in order to correct the un-
derreporting at the top tail of the wealth distribution.

rose from 0.2% in 2009 to more than 1.2% in 
2021.6
Against this backdrop, the chart on p. 25 shows 
average quarterly growth and the contributions 
to growth of major asset categories for the 
four different groupings of households. For the 
purpose of clarity, a distinction is made here 
between the financial portfolio, business 
wealth, housing wealth, and liabilities.7 The ag -
gregate net wealth of households in Germany 
has grown by an average of around 1.3% per 
quarter since 2009. This growth has been par -
ticularly strong for the bottom half of the distri -
bution, albeit starting from a low level. In this context, households in the bottom half of the 
distribution have accumulated a significant vol -
ume of low- risk assets, such as deposits and in -
surance claims, in their financial portfolio, 
whilst at the same time markedly reducing their 
liabilities. The upper mid- range of the distribu -
tion, on the other hand, has benefited com -
paratively strongly from the increased value of 
housing wealth. One reason for this is that less 
wealthy households rarely own real estate. An -
other reason is that housing wealth accounts 
for a much smaller share of very wealthy house -
holds’ total assets. The increases in house 
prices observed in recent years have therefore 
probably tended to have a balancing effect on 
the net wealth distribution, taken in isolation.8 
Finally, the growth in net wealth seen in the 
top 1% of the distribution is mainly attributable 
to increases in business wealth. The high share 
of growth accounted for by this asset type at 
the top tail of the distribution also reflects the 
increased importance of corporate savings in 
the wealth development of very wealthy house -
holds in recent decades. Although these are 
typically retained corporate profits, they are ul -
timately attributable to shareholders.9
The divergent developments in net wealth are 
due, amongst other things, to unequally dis -
tributed asset types, which are reflected in dis -
cernible differences in the wealth structure 
along the wealth distribution. Similar differ -
ences can also be identified in the euro area 
and in the United States (see also the box on 
pp. 23 ff.). Looking at the average structure of 
total wealth (gross) for the four wealth group -
ings between 2009 and 2021, it can be seen

6 In a longer- term context, however, a rise in inequality can 
be seen. For example, calculated in real terms (i.e. with all

bution declined from more than 5% to less than 3% in the

Net wealth distribution and portfolio structure of 
households  in Germany by international standards
We will examine below how the net wealth 
distribution and portfolio structure of 
households in Germany compare with other 
countries, using the euro area (including 
Germany) and the United States as bench-
marks. The dataset for the euro area is iden-
tical to that for Germany in terms of the 
defi  nition of instruments. However, at the 
upper tail of the distribution, only values for 
the top 10% are available. In the German 
data, the wealth groupings “top 1%” and 
“next 9%” are consolidated accordingly. 
The fi  gures for the United States are con-
solidated in the same manner. In addition, 
the data for the United States differ, in 
some cases considerably, from the German 
and euro area- wide fi  gures regarding the 
defi  nition of instruments. As a result, the 
portfolio breaks down into only three larger 
categories, where comparability is better 
than in the granular analysis: housing 
wealth, equity and business wealth (includ-
ing investment funds), and other fi  nancial 
assets, defi  ned here as the difference be-
tween total assets and the other two cat-
egories. It consists, in particular, of deposits 
and claims on insurance corporations.
Net wealth is distributed more unevenly in 
Germany than in the euro area, but is less 
concentrated than in the United States (see 
the adjacent chart).1 According to this, the 
percentage share of the wealthiest 10% of 
households at the end of 2021 was some-
what smaller in the euro area than in Ger-
many, but was noticeably higher in the 
United States. The share of the next 40% in 
Germany is roughly as high as in the euro area, but much larger than in the United 
States. In Germany, the share of the less 
wealthy 50% of households in total net 
wealth was around as small as in the United 
States. In the euro area, however, this share 
is noticeably higher. The net wealth distri-
bution in Germany has changed only slightly 
compared with the fi  rst quarter of 2011. In 
the euro area, it has shifted from the top 
10% of the distribution to the next 40%. In 
the United States, by contrast, the next 
40% surrendered wealth shares to both the 
top 10% and the bottom 50% of the net 
wealth distribution.
The distribution of various wealth compon-
ents between wealth groupings varies only 
marginally (see the upper chart on p. 24), 
with almost all housing wealth split halfway 
between the top 10% and the next 40% of 
the distribution. Equity and business wealth 
is almost exclusively owned by the top 10% 
of the distribution. German households 
stand out by comparison in terms of the 
distribution of other fi  nancial assets. Almost 
half of these are held by those households

at the upper midpoint of the distribution. In 
the euro area and the United States, by 
contrast, the fi  gure is just over one- third. 
The top 10% of the distribution in Germany 
hold a signifi  cantly smaller share, compara-
tively speaking. Liabilities, however, are dis-
tributed more evenly across the three 
wealth groupings. Owing to the uneven 
distribution of assets, this is refl  ected in sig-
nifi  cant differences in net wealth.
On the other hand, portfolio composition 
varies quite signifi  cantly across wealth 
groupings (see the chart below). In com-parison with housing wealth, equity and 
business wealth are much more important 
in the top 10% of the distribution in the 
United States than in Germany and the 
euro area. By contrast, housing wealth plays 
a considerably smaller role. This means that 
the top 10% of wealth distribution in the 
United States is highly exposed to changes 
in corporate valuations. By comparison, 
their counterparts in Germany and the euro 
area are exposed, in particular, to house 
price swings. With regard to the next 40%, 
housing wealth, which accounts for just 
over two- thirds of the overall portfolio, is Distribution of assets and liabilities

the wealth distribution.10 In addition, the rate 
of real estate ownership is comparatively low.11 
By contrast, housing wealth makes up more 
than half of the total assets of the next 49%. 
For the top 1%, business wealth plays a signifi -
cant role as well (see the upper chart on p. 26). 
Overall, it can be seen that the wealth of the 
top 1% of the distribution is therefore primarily 
vulnerable to changes in the valuation of busi -
ness wealth, which largely consists of equity in -
vestments in the form of unlisted shares or 
other equity. By contrast, the wealth of house -
holds in the upper mid- range of the distribu -
tion is primarily exposed to potential price fluc -
tuations for housing wealth.signifi  cantly more important in Germany 
and the euro area than in the United States, 
where housing wealth makes up only just 
over one- third. By contrast, for the next 
40% of the distribution in the United States, 
other fi  nancial assets, especially in the form 
of pensions, account for around one- half of 
total assets. In Germany and the euro area, 
on the other hand, the share is only just 
over one- quarter. The portfolios of the less 
wealthy 50% of households in Germany 
and the United States are roughly compar-
able, with housing wealth and other fi  nan-
cial assets each accounting for around half 
of this fi  gure. By comparison, the share of 
housing wealth in the euro area, at just 
over two- thirds, is roughly twice that of 
other fi  nancial assets. For the bottom half 
of the wealth distribution in all three re-
gions, equity and business wealth tend to 
be essentially a non- factor. Overall, this 
wealth grouping is therefore less exposed to market price fl  uctuations. However, 
owing to the high level of liabilities, espe-
cially those held by households in Germany, 
changes in interest rates can expect to be 
passed through much more strongly to the 
servicing of debt.

10 The average portfolio structure is determined by work -
ing out the average across all household- specific wealth 
structures. When depicting averages, conditional mean val -
ues are shown throughout, unless otherwise stated. Specif -
ically, only households with positive total (gross) assets are 
included in the calculation.
11 According to the DWA, the rate of real estate owner -
ship in the top and bottom halves of the distribution stands 
at around 85% and 15% respectively. See also Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank

In addition to the varying structures of house -
holds’ total assets, however, the provisional 
DWA also show significant differences in the 
composition of their financial portfolios (see 
the lower chart on this page). The financial 
portfolio of the bottom half of the distribution 
consists almost solely of deposits and insurance 
claims. By comparison, the share of securities 
(debt securities, listed shares and investment 
funds) in the financial portfolio of wealthy 
households is significantly higher. Households 
in the bottom half of the wealth distribution fa -
vour liquid assets, such as deposits, precisely so 
they do not need to reduce their consumption 
as much in the event of unexpected income fluctuations. However, this precautionary sav -
ing motive declines as wealth rises. As a result, 
less liquid and thus riskier asset types are in -
creasingly held in the portfolio.12 Moreover, it is 
striking that the aggregate structure of the 
financial portfolio is most closely aligned with 
the average portfolio composition of the two 
top wealth groupings, i.e. the top 10% of the 
wealth distribution. This is essentially attribut -
able to the size of the financial portfolio of this 
top 10%. The macroeconomic aggregate is pri -
marily dominated by the financial assets held 
by these households: the wealthiest 10% hold 
around a 50% share of the aggregate financial 
portfolio wealth, while the less wealthy 50% 
hold only about 8%.
A disaggregated analysis of 
portfolio returns on financial 
assets
In view of the varying structure of financial 
portfolios along the net wealth distribution, it 
is to be expected that differences in portfolio 
composition, coupled with differing instrument- 
specific returns, will produce a very mixed pic -
ture with regard to individual portfolio returns. 
As it is possible to calculate portfolio returns at 
the level of individual households over time 
using DWA data, these returns will be exam -
ined more closely in the following.
The methodology used to calculate disaggre -
gated returns essentially follows the approach 
used to determine the aggregate total return.13 
The financial portfolio considered here com -
prises the following types of asset: deposits, 
debt securities, listed shares, investment funds 
and insurance claims. The total return on 
households’ financial portfolios is calculated 
based on their main sources of income. Whilst

come a bank deposit can generate, for other 
types of financial asset, such as listed shares, 
debt securities, investment funds and insurance 
claims, income flows also depend on price ef -
fects. In addition, shares and investment funds 
that invest in equities commonly pay out divi -
dends, too. Any attempt to calculate house -
holds’ total return on the financial portfolio 
therefore needs to consider not just interest 
payments but these other components as well. 
The analysis also takes into account the fact 
that the purchasing power of nominal returns 
fluctuates due to inflation. This means that all 
the returns are analysed in real terms.14
The above chart depicts the real returns on in -
dividual asset types since 2009. Developments 
here have varied quite considerably over the 
past few years. For instance, the real return on 
bank deposits and debt securities has been 
mostly negative in recent years. By contrast, 
the real return on listed shares and investment 
funds was predominantly positive, despite oc -
casional fluctuations. Insurance claims also re -
corded a positive real return, for the most part. 
On average, however, this was lower than the 
return on securities. If the instrument-  specific 
returns are now weighted by their share of the 
individual financial portfolio, the total real re -
turn of a household can be calculated.The development of portfolio returns along the 
distribution of wealth is shown in the chart on 
p.  28. The continuous lines show the mean 
value of the respective wealth grouping at a 
given point in time. The shaded area represents 
the range of variation between the 25th and 
the 75th percentiles of the respective grouping. 
A comparison of the four wealth groupings 
shows that in the period between 2009 and 
the first quarter of 2022, the average real re -
turn (dashed line) rose as net wealth in -
creased.15 While the average real return comes 
to a mean of 0% for the bottom 50% of the 
distribution, it stands at around 1.5% for the 
top 1%. Furthermore, it can be seen that the 
volatility of the returns increases as net wealth 
rises. This is, first and foremost, the result of 
higher capital market investment; although 
households achieve higher returns on the cap -
ital market, they simultaneously bear height -
ened risk in the form of fluctuating asset valu -
ations. Additionally, the shading shows that 
heterogeneity within a grouping also increases 
as net wealth rises.Clear differences

Differences in the rate of return between 
wealth groupings are due to variations in port -
folio composition coupled with the differing re -
turns on individual asset types. This becomes 
particularly evident when looking at the contri -
butions of the various assets to the total return 
across the four wealth groupings (see the chart 
on p. 29). For example, the total return for the 
bottom half of the wealth distribution is shaped 
almost exclusively by low- risk assets in the form 
of deposits and insurance claims. As the return 
on these two asset types has been relatively 
weak in recent years, the total return has also 
been correspondingly low and, in most cases, 
even negative. By contrast, the return for the 
top 10% of the wealth distribution was influ -
enced significantly by the return on capital 
market instruments over the observation 
period. In particular, positive price develop -
ments contributed to high returns, which were 
then reflected correspondingly in the total re -
turn. For comparative purposes, the chart on 
p. 29 also tracks the development of aggregate 
real returns on the financial portfolio produced 
when only national accounts data are used for 
the calculation. Here, it can ultimately be es -
tablished that analyses which do not take dis -
tributional information into account – such as 
the aggregate real portfolio returns of house -
holds in Germany16 – have only presented a 
representative picture for the top end of the wealth distribution. By contrast, basing an an -
alysis on the DWA allows for a much more dif -
ferentiated assessment.
Portfolio returns of house -
holds in Germany including 
housing wealth
In addition to the different structures in the 
financial portfolio, however, the DWA also 
show an unequal distribution of housing and 
business wealth across individual household 
groups: the wealth in the bottom half of the 
wealth distribution is predominantly made up 
of financial assets. By contrast, housing and 
business wealth account for a significant share 
in the top half. The focus on the financial port -
folio therefore only offers an incomplete view 
with respect to the performance of total house -
hold assets. Taking the above into account, the 
following analysis additionally documents re -
turns on total assets along the distribution. 
Here, disaggregated returns on assets are, as a 
rule, calculated using the same method as dis -

and non- financial business wealth and housing 
wealth are now also taken into account along -
side traditional financial assets:
– Financial business wealth: this item com -
prises equity investments that are not traded 
on organised markets. Owing to a lack of 
market data, it is not possible to directly cal -
culate the return for these instruments. It is 
therefore assumed that returns are generally 
similar to those of comparable tradable in -
struments. In the case of unlisted shares, for 
example, the same valuation changes and 
dividend yields are recognised as for listed 
shares.17 The sum of these two components 
gives the total return on unlisted shares. 
Changes in the valuation of other equity are 
approximated on the basis of the informa -
tion provided in the financial accounts.18 The 
portion of the returns attributable to profit 
distributions is assumed to be equal to the 
observed dividend yield on listed shares. As 
with unlisted shares, these two components 
result in the total return on other equity. Fi -
nally, a weighted average is calculated from 
the two returns. This value is derived from 
the levels in the financial accounts for un -
listed shares and other equity. This ultimately 
reflects the total return on financial business 
wealth.
– Non- financial business wealth: it is not pos -
sible to directly determine the return here ei -
ther. However, this type of asset is, in prin -
ciple, very similar to other equity.19 For this 
reason, performance is estimated for non-  
financial business wealth in the same man -
ner as for other equity.Contributions of various asset types to

– Housing wealth: this category includes both 
dwellings and the land underlying dwellings. 
Returns are calculated using the house price 
and rent price indices of the Federal Statis -
tical Office by applying a rent- price ap -
proach.20 The year- on- year change in the 
house price index corresponds to the change 
in the valuation of housing wealth. The 
change in the rent price index compared 
with the previous year’s figure for the house 
price index gives the rental yield. The total 
return on housing wealth is then calculated 
using the valuation changes and the rental 
yield.
The above chart depicts the real returns on the 
three asset types since 2009. Over time, they 
have developed quite differently. Real returns 
on housing were consistently positive, rising 
from just over 3% in 2009 to around 11% at 
the beginning of 2022. By comparison, real re -
turns on financial and non- financial business 
wealth were more volatile and also, on aver -
age, lower. They were even clearly in negative 
territory during the financial and economic cri -
sis and the European sovereign debt crisis.
Taking these three additional asset types into 
account, it is now possible to calculate a real 
return on total assets which is expanded to in -
clude these asset components. The chart on p. 31 shows the development of real returns on 
the financial portfolio and on total assets along 
the wealth distribution. The lines show the 
average real returns for the respective wealth 
grouping. This expanded perspective on the 
real return on assets reveals clear differences: 
compared with the real return on the financial 
portfolio, the real return on assets is noticeably 
higher, especially for households in the top half 
of the distribution of wealth.
The main reason for these differences is the 
low level of housing and non- financial wealth 
in the bottom half of the wealth distribution 
when compared with the top half. Around 
90% of households’ real return on assets in the 
50% to 99% range of the distribution was 
based on contributions from housing wealth 
(see the chart on p. 32). As this type of asset 
(alongside shares) recorded, on average, the 
highest return of all asset components in the 
observation period, it played a key role in Housing wealth

Consequently, this approach initially envisages scaling the 
two indices according to an initial rent- price ratio at the 
starting time t0 (see Jordà et al. (2019)). Based on this initial 
value, both indices can be depicted at each time t in such 
a way that the ratio of the scaled indices reflects the devel -

achieving a high total return. Housing wealth 
also made a significant contribution to total re -
turns for the top 1% of the wealth distribution. 
This was, however, additionally boosted by a 
distinct contribution from business wealth. 
Overall, the contribution of the financial port -
folio to returns plays only a minor role for 
households in the top half of the wealth distri -
bution. By comparison, while housing wealth 
also made a consistently positive contribution 
to returns for the bottom half, this was never -
theless comparatively small, owing to the low 
proportion of housing wealth in the total. In 
addition, the results as a whole show that, in 
real terms, the yield- lowering effect of inflation 
is particularly noticeable at the bottom end of 
the wealth distribution. Compared with the 
rest of the households, the total assets of these 
households consist mainly of low- interest de -
posits. In this respect, high inflation rates tend 
to lead to negative real returns on assets.21
However, the finding that there is a compara -
tively low real return on assets for the bottom 
half of the wealth distribution owing to the 
high importance of low-  yielding assets in the 
asset structure disregards the fact that the low 
interest rate environment of recent years also 
had a noticeable impact on the real interest 
rate on liabilities. Last year, for example, the 
real interest burden for mortgages and other debt reached historical lows of around -2.7% 
on average. By comparison, this figure stood at 
just over 5% in 2009. In order to account for 
this easing effect, the real return on a house -
hold’s assets is additionally adjusted for real 
interest expenditure. The average leverage ratio 
(total liabilities as a percentage of total assets) 
of the bottom 50% of the distribution stood at 
around 90% in the observation period; in the 
top half, this ratio was only slightly more than 
10%. As it is particularly those households in 
the bottom half of the distribution of wealth 
that are relatively heavily indebted, the adjust -
ment has a notable effect in this area above 
others. For example, the adjusted real return 
on assets for the bottom half is clearly shifted 
into negative territory (see the upper chart on 
p. 33). However, this return has recorded a dis -
cernible upward trend over the past few years 
owing to the increased easing effect. It must

21 It should be noted here that according to the consumer 
price index, the inflation rate is assumed to be identical for 
all households at time t. This is, however, a simplifying as -
sumption, as it can mask considerable heterogeneity 
among households. Studies show, for example, that house -
holds with lower incomes are exposed to significantly 
higher individual inflation rates than households with 
higher incomes. See Gürer and Weichenrieder (2020). As 
this aspect would, in principle, reinforce the above assess -
ment, this does not affect the general statement based on 
the available results.Deutsche Bundesbank

almost exclusively in the bottom half of the dis -
tribution of wealth, currently hold low- yielding 
assets for the most part while, at the same 
time, having no debt. These households there -
fore cannot benefit from lower real lending 
rates. This is why the current high level of infla -
tion is mainly weighing on these households’ 
low level of wealth in the form of significantly 
negative real returns on assets.
Conclusion
The Distributional Wealth Accounts (DWA) for 
households in Germany represent a new provi -
sional dataset combining two data perspec -
tives: namely, they link the Bundesbank’s Panel 
on Household Finances (PHF) with the national 
accounts statistics. The DWA incorporate the 
distributional information from the PHF and 
simultaneously reflect the quarterly dynamics 
and levels of the national accounts statistics in 
a consistent manner. As the dynamics of the 
dataset are derived from the national accounts 
data, the DWA also have a distinct advantage 
in terms of temporal availability compared with 
the complex and time- consuming PHF. This ul -
timately allows comprehensive analyses to be 
carried out on a quarterly basis at the level of 
individual households. Statements can then be 
made regarding the development of the wealth 
and debt situation along the wealth distribu -
tion, for example. According to these state -
ments, the DWA show that wealth inequality 
has decreased slightly in recent years. This is 
due, on the one hand, to the fact that growth 
in net wealth for the bottom 50% of the distri -
bution was particularly steep – albeit starting 
from a low level. In this context, the house -
holds in the less wealthy half built up a signifi -
cant volume of low- risk assets such as deposits 
and insurance claims, whilst at the same time 
markedly reducing their debt. On the other 
hand, households in the upper mid- range of 
the distribution benefited noticeably from the 
rising value of their housing wealth.DWA consist -

The DWA also reveal considerable heterogen -
eity among household wealth structures, which 
typically remains hidden when using macro -
data. This aspect became particularly clear 
when looking at household- specific returns 
along the wealth distribution. Discernible dif -
ferences in the composition of assets have a 
marked impact on the real return on assets of 
the respective household portfolio. For ex -
ample, the wealth of the bottom half of the 
wealth distribution consists predominantly of 
low- risk asset types. The interest on these in -
struments has been relatively low in recent 
years, which has been reflected in a low total 
return. By contrast, households’ wealth in the 
top half of the distribution consists to a much 
greater degree of capital market instruments 
and housing and business wealth, with these 
last two in particular accounting for a signifi -
cant share of total wealth. As, on average, 
housing wealth – alongside listed shares – re -
corded the highest real return of all asset com -
ponents in the observation period (2009 to 
early 2022), households in the top half of the 
distribution achieved a significantly higher total 
return. In addition, business wealth made a dis -
tinct contribution for the top 1% of the wealth 
distribution. Moreover, the results show that 
the yield- lowering effect of inflation is particu -
larly noticeable at the bottom end of the 
wealth distribution. The total wealth of these households consists largely of low-  interest de -
posits. As a result, high inflation rates are more 
likely to lead to negative real returns on assets 
in these cases especially.DWA reveal

The distribution of pandemic- related savings of households 
in Germany
The saving and investment behaviour of 
households in Germany has been decisively 
shaped by the course of the coronavirus pan-
demic so far. At the start of the pandemic, for 
example, there was an exceptional increase in 
saving.1 The main reason for this was reduced 
opportunities for consumption owing to 
measures to contain the coronavirus pan-
demic – businesses being ordered to close, for 
instance, and travel restrictions. However, 
concerns about catching the virus also led 
people to limit their spending, so this also 
contributed to increased saving. By contrast, 
precautionary saving due to expected income 
losses played only a minor role in view of ex-
tensive government support.2
In this context, the adjacent chart illustrates 
the exceptional increase in household saving 
at the beginning of 2020, as well as providing 
insight into how those savings were used. It shows that, at the start of the pandemic, the 
rise in savings was initially accompanied by 
large infl  ows to currency holdings and de-
posits, in particular. At the same time, there 
was a persistent upward trend in infl  ows to 
listed shares and investment funds. The build- 
up of deposits has subsided somewhat since 
the second quarter of 2021, which may indi-
cate that, besides consumption normalising as 
some pandemic containment measures were 
rolled back, the additional savings were also 
reduced in some cases in order to cover higher 
energy and living costs. Given the continued 
strong infl  ows into listed shares and invest-
ment funds, the rebalancing of portfolios 
away from deposits and towards those spe-
cifi  c forms of investment probably also played 
a certain role. Overall, the additional savings 
accumulated due to the pandemic are likely to 
have amounted to around €200 billion at the 
end of 2021. They are held primarily in the 
form of currency and deposits as well as listed 
shares and investment fund shares.3
Given the high level of additional savings ob-
served at the aggregate level, the question 
arises as to how these are distributed across 
individual households. This aspect can be illus-
trated in a stylised way using the Distribu-
tional Wealth Accounts. To do so, a counter-
1 This phenomenon can also be observed in other ad-
vanced economies. See European Central Bank 
(2021a).
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b, 2022) for savings 
motives in connection with the pandemic.
3 The volume of additional savings is determined by 
comparing quarterly saving since 2020 with the aver-
age quarterly savings for 2018 and 2019 (for a similar 
approach, see Batty et al. (2021)). The cumulative devi-
ations over the 2020 to 2021 period ultimately yield 
the total volume of additional savings accumulated. 
According to this approach, the cumulative additional 
savings amount to around €200 billion. Calculations 
based on the macroeconomic projections point to 
comparable fi  gures (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b, 
2022)). The use of the additional savings can also be 
calculated in a similar way: the cumulative quarterly 
deviations of instrument- specifi  c transactions since 
2020 from the quarterly average for 2018 and 2019 in-
dicate how the additional savings were invested during 
the observation period.Aggregate use of savings by households

factual version of the Distributional Wealth 
Accounts is prepared, which assumes that 
there were no additional savings due to the 
pandemic.4 Comparing the holdings in the 
counterfactual Distributional Wealth Accounts 
at the end of 2021 with the actual data ultim-
ately reveals the distribution of the cumulative 
additional savings (see the adjacent chart). It 
can be seen that mainly households at the top 
tail of the wealth distribution have accumu-
lated signifi  cant additional savings in absolute 
amounts. Whilst a household in the bottom 
half of the distribution currently has additional 
savings totalling around €420, a household in 
the top 1% of the distribution accounts for an 
additional amount of roughly €120,000 on 
average. Currency and deposits make up 
around 75% of the total additional savings for 
the bottom half of the wealth distribution. As 
net wealth increases, this share shifts mark-
edly towards listed shares and investment 
funds.5 In light of the signifi  cant rise in energy 
costs and the cost of living, the results sug-
gest that the additional savings generally help 
mitigate the resulting fi  nancial burdens to a 
certain extent,6 but they also show that this 
does not apply equally to all households. Ex-
tensive savings were built up mainly by 
wealthy households. Owing to the compara-
tively low volumes per household in the less 
wealthy half of the distribution, the buffer ef-
fect of the additional savings appears to be 
fairly limited for those households. Rising en-
ergy costs and the cost of living are therefore 
likely to place a greater strain on households 
at the bottom end of the wealth distribution 
compared with others.
4 As the aggregate transactions in the chart on p. 34 
indicate that the bulk of the excess savings have 
fl  owed into currency holdings and deposits as well as 
into listed shares and investment funds, for the coun-
terfactual alternative, quarterly excess savings are 
accord ingly deducted from these two asset types 
(distrib uted proportionally across these two categories; 
see also Batty et al. (2021)).
5 For more on the distribution of additional savings 
due to the pandemic in the international context, see 
European Central Bank (2021a). Overall, it can be seen 
that households with high incomes and wealth, in par-
ticular, have accumulated additional savings (see, inter 
alia, Bank of England (2020), Batty et al. (2021), 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b) and European Central 
Bank (2021b, 2022a)).

In addition to the use cases outlined above (see 
also the box on pp. 34 ff.), the dataset presented 
here is likely to become more relevant for mon -
etary policy in future. There are a great many 
studies focusing on the interplay between 
monetary policy and inequality.22 They show 
that, although monetary policy measures can 
generally have an impact on the distribution of 
wealth, the development of inequality over the 
past few decades has been driven predomin -
antly by factors outside the scope of monetary 
policy. Of course, this must be seen in light of 
the fact that monetary policy typically has nei -
ther the mandate nor the appropriate instru -
ments to steer distributions in a targeted man -
ner. It is instead the finding that heterogeneity 
between households can affect the transmis -sion of monetary policy that appears much 
more important. This means that the effective -
ness of monetary policy measures depends, 
amongst other things, on the distribution and 
structure of wealth. Balance sheet constraints 
could also affect the impact of monetary policy 
measures.23 When assessing the impact of such 
measures, then, it may generally be helpful to 
bear in mind the financial differences between 
households. It is precisely against this backdrop 
that the future provision of the DWA seems of 
particular interest to a central bank.As wealth 
distribution  can 
affect the trans -
mission of mon -
etary policy, it 
seems helpful to 
be able to take 
due account of 
the financial 
differences  
between 
households

Factors influencing international portfolio 
flows
The free movement of capital is a core element of open economies. It allows for efficiency gains 
and can help to mitigate country- specific risks internationally. Being closely interconnected with 
other countries can also be a source of risk, however, especially if it leads to unilateral depend -
encies.
Cross- border portfolio investment – transactions in equities, mutual fund shares and debt secur -
ities between residents and non- residents – accounts for a significant proportion of international 
capital flows. The comparatively high volatility of these transactions presents challenges in terms 
of economic policy, particularly for emerging market economies, but also for advanced econ -
omies, too. For this reason, there is great interest in gaining a better understanding of the factors 
that drive portfolio flows.
The economic literature makes a distinction between international “push” factors and country-  
specific “pull” factors. Domestic and foreign economic developments play a prominent role in this 
regard, while movements in equity markets, uncertainty, commodity prices, and the international 
interest rate environment are also significant drivers.
The international interest rate environment is shaped to a large extent by US monetary policy. 
Analysis reveals that the US Federal Reserve exerts an influence on international portfolio flows 
not only via “pure policy” responses, but also by means of the information that it provides on the 
US economy as a key driver of global economic activity. Bundesbank estimates find that monet -
ary policy responses by the US Federal Reserve have a stronger impact on flows into bond funds 
investing in emerging market economies than on funds investing in advanced economies.
Another Bundesbank study shows that there is variation over time in the degree to which the 
drivers of cross-  border capital flows affect fund flows into individual countries. In this context, 
there is variation across regions (advanced economies versus emerging market economies) and 
also across asset classes (equities versus bonds), with the international drivers of portfolio flows 
gaining in significance in various advanced economies, especially Member States of the European 
Union, over the 15 years under review. As regards portfolio flows into emerging market econ -
omies, the results are found to vary widely across countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The increasing interconnectedness of the global 
economy is directly linked to cross- border cap -
ital flows. The ability to invest capital around 
the world or raise capital abroad broadens the 
spectrum of investment opportunities. This can 
foster and entrench economic growth in the 
economies involved. However, a high degree of 
capital mobility is also a source of risk. Under 
the right conditions, it can promote abrupt 
swings in financial flows, destabilising the real 
economy.
This holds particularly true for assets that are 
highly liquid and thereby exposed to constant 
influence from foreign and domestic factors. 
These mainly include securities that are traded 
globally. In the balance of payments, these 
cross- border securities transactions are consoli -
dated under the item “portfolio investment”. 
They include trading in equities, mutual fund 
shares and debt securities with non- residents.1 
The comparatively high volatility of these trans -
actions presents challenges for emerging mar -
ket economies in particular, but also for ad -
vanced economies, too. From an economic 
perspective, there is particular interest in under -
standing the factors that drive portfolio flows. 
The analyses presented in this article investi -
gate the determinants and their significance for 
portfolio flows.2 Particular attention is paid to 
the role played by US monetary policy as well 
as how the importance of international and 
country- specific factors varies over time.
This article begins by discussing the economic 
significance of cross- border capital flows, mak -
ing a distinction between characteristics that 
support economic activity and those that in -
hibit it. It then explains how portfolio flows fit 
into the bigger picture of cross- border capital 
flows and the wider balance of payments, dis -
tinguishing between the various analytical 
methods that can be used to investigate port -
folio flows. It is important to make this distinc -
tion because, in some cases, different research 
approaches in the economic literature come to different conclusions regarding the significance 
of individual factors. As there is such a wide 
range of factors that influence portfolio flows, 
this article focuses on some of the main drivers 
– such as economic developments, movements 
in equity markets, and risk aversion. Two ana -
lyses are presented in this context to highlight 
the effects of US monetary policy on portfolio 
flows as well as how the significance of drivers 
varies over time.
Economic significance of 
cross- border capital flows
Characteristics that support 
and stabilise the economy
The free movement of capital, which opens up 
the possibility of employing funds worldwide, 
fosters the efficient allocation of capital around 
the world. As a result, consistent with the eco -
nomic rationale of maximising profits and util -
ity, financial resources are allocated where – for 
a given level of risk – they generate the highest 
return.
Cross- border portfolio investment in particular 
offers investors a way of reducing their risk by 
adding a broadly diversified basket of different 
securities from different countries to their port -
folio rather than a single paper.
Besides offering benefits in terms of efficiency, 
international capital flows are a means of off -
setting temporary country- specific fluctuations 
in income and thus smoothing consumption.3

projected on that basis are often disrupted by Cross- border

1 The balance of payments statistics differentiate between 
portfolio investment and direct investment by categorising 
the former as holdings of less than 10% of an enterprise’s 
shares.
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2020a).
3 The lifetime income theory posits that households prefer 
a smooth path of consumption to large fluctuations in their 
standard of living. See, for example, Obstfeld and Rogoff 
(1996).Deutsche Bundesbank

unexpected events.4 If, for example, a natural 
disaster depresses a country’s economic output 
and thus also household incomes, international 
capital flows can help to sustain consumption 
through the crisis by borrowing from abroad.5 
In such a case, the households or general gov -
ernment affected by the natural disaster stabil -
ise their consumption by means of an “inter -
temporal trade” – they borrow to bring some 
of their future consumption forward to the 
present.6
Characteristics that inhibit and 
destabilise the economy
Having large stocks of assets or extensive liabil -
ities abroad also entails being exposed to par -
ticular risks, however. Expectations that an 
economy will develop favourably typically gen -
erate strong capital imports and thus drive up 
that country’s external liabilities. If these fore -
casts turn out to have been overly optimistic, 
financial flows can suddenly stop or, in un -
favourable circumstances, even reverse. Sud -
den stops like this often lead to severe eco -
nomic crises. One such event was the Asian cri -
sis triggered in 1997: in the early 1990s, many 
South- East Asian economies were attracting 
strong flows from abroad. Investors seemed to 
have been expecting a high return on their cap -
ital in these countries. However, when the as -
sessments of these countries’ economic pro -
spects changed, they pulled their capital out 
again. This process triggered severe recessions 
and currency crises in many South- East Asian 
countries. These then rippled to other parts of 
the world and caused crises there, too, such as 
in Mexico and Russia.
However, this does not mean that advanced 
economies are immune to financial distress and 
contagion, as proved in 2008 during the global 
financial crisis and shortly afterwards during 
the European sovereign debt crisis. Even coun -
tries with high net capital exports and corres -
ponding levels of net external assets can be af -fected, especially if those assets are insuffi -
ciently diversified.
Portfolio flows as part of the 
balance of payments
The importance of cross- border capital flows, 
and thus also of portfolio flows, for an econ -
omy differs from one country to the next and 
can be derived from the balance of payments. 
The balance of payments records all economic 
transactions between residents and non-  
residents within a given period (month, quarter 
or year).7 As these transactions can differ in 
character, they are broken down into sub-  
accounts: the current account, capital account 
and financial account.8 Of these, the current 
and financial accounts are generally considered 
the most important. The current account re -
cords cross- border trade in goods, services as 
well as primary and secondary income. If this 
account is in surplus, this implies that a coun -
try’s receipts from current transactions with 
non- residents are higher than the correspond -
ing expenditure paid to non- residents. The pay -
ments associated with current transactions are 
recorded in the financial account.Sudden stops,

4 A positive event would be an unexpected discovery of 
natural resources, for example, while a negative one would 
be an unforeseen natural disaster. For this model, the key 
aspect is that the event comes as a surprise. This is because 
a foreseeable decline in income, such as due to retirement, 
is, according to the lifetime income theory, generally al -
ways factored into consumption decisions, while only an 
unexpected change leads to an immediate shift in house -
holds’ consumption and saving behaviour.
5 See Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996). The intertemporal ap -
proach to the current account is based on (net) capital 
flows in general. Many of the transactions belonging to 
this category would, in practice, be categorised as “other 
investment”.
6 Enterprises and government, too, would generally bor -
row more in this kind of situation, albeit with different in -
tentions in mind. These agents do not play any role in the 
intertemporal approach to the current account, however.
7 A detailed account of Germany’s balance of payments 
for 2021 was presented in Deutsche Bundesbank (2022).
8 The current (sixth) edition of the International Monetary 
Fund’s Balance of Payments and International Investment 
Position Manual states how individual transactions should 
be recorded.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2022  
41

However, the financial account records not 
only payments related to current transactions, 
but also cross- border transactions involving 
financial instruments of all kinds. These also in -
clude the portfolio investment mentioned 
above. In addition, the financial account makes 
a further distinction between direct investment, 
financial derivatives, reserve assets, and other 
investment. Other investment comprises loans 
and trade credits (where these do not consti -
tute direct investment) as well as bank deposits 
and other capital.
The analysis presented in this article centres on 
portfolio investment, as this is influenced in a 
unique way by the short- term investment deci -
sions of international investors. The signifi -
cance of this asset category for a national 
economy becomes clear when the individual 
flows are expressed in relation to gross domes -
tic product (GDP). For example, since the intro -
duction of the euro, German investors have 
purchased foreign securities for an amount averaging 4.7% of German GDP each year. 
Non- residents, meanwhile, have added Ger -
man securities to their portfolios for an average 
of 2.7% of German GDP . Added up over a little 
more than 20 years, the figures show that port -
folio flows in Germany are highly important for 
the national economy and that there is signifi -
cance in both their stabilising and destabilising 
characteristics. The same holds true for other 
countries.
Different analytical options for 
portfolio flows
The body of literature on the drivers of port -
folio flows has grown rapidly over the past few 
years.9 However, different investigations do not 
always produce the same findings. This is partly 
because, on closer inspection, the studies differ 
fairly substantially in some cases.
First, not all studies focus exclusively on port -
folio flows. Some examine international capital 
flows as a whole. Second, some studies break 
these flows down into direct investment, port -
folio investment and other investment.10 Within 
these categories, flows can also be subdivided 
further still – into equities, bonds and mutual 
fund shares in the portfolio investment cat -
egory, for example. Equities and bonds are sub -
ject to different levels of demand, depending 
on the macroeconomic environment for indi -
vidual investors. As a result, different study 
findings are possible in this regard, too, along 
different dimensions. It is therefore essential to 
define the capital and portfolio flows precisely 
in order to make the findings comparable.
However, even investigations that focus expli -
citly on portfolio investment, and perhaps 
make a distinction between equities and debt 
securities as well, will not necessarily be based 
on the same data. While some authors take an Flows also par -

interest in the evolution of net flows, the ma -
jority of cross- country analyses use gross flows. 
These studies typically investigate which factors 
drive increased demand for or sales of a par -
ticular country’s equities and debt securities in 
international capital markets. Applied on a 
global scale, this approach explains cross-  
border portfolio investment in its entirety.
Another way to investigate rising or falling de -
mand for securities using volume data (rather 
than price data) is to analyse flows into funds 
that invest in certain countries. Investment 
funds pool together the financial resources of 
international investors and are obliged to allo -
cate them in line with their investment strategy. 
The data obtained in this manner differ from 
balance of payments statistics in two ways. 
First, the funds in question also receive flows 
from residents, for example from German 
savers who acquire stakes in German enter -
prises in this way. Second, the data capture 
only securities that are traded indirectly via in -
vestment companies, but not investors’ direct 
transactions in individual equities or debt secur -
ities. One benefit of fund data, however, is 
that, unlike balance of payments statistics, they 
are available for many countries in near real-  
time and at a high frequency.
Ultimately, cross- country studies need to make 
the capital flows of differently sized countries 
comparable with one another, which is why 
the original data from the balance of payments 
are often expressed in relation to a country’s 
GDP . Where fund flows are used as the dataset, 
it makes sense to use the existing total fund 
volume at the start of given a period as a point 
of reference. This also has the advantage of 
largely eliminating the influence of valuation 
changes. Lastly, it is also possible to logarith -
mise the original data as a way of visualising 
percentage changes rather than absolute vari -
ables.
One final point is that studies often differ in 
terms of frequency, observation period, or the 
group of countries under review. All of these aspects mean that the empirical evidence re -
garding the significance of individual drivers of 
portfolio flows is inconsistent across studies.11
Selected determinants of 
international  portfolio flows

ready divides the drivers of portfolio flows into 
separate categories at a higher level, breaking 
them down into international “push” factors 
and country- specific “pull” factors.12 According Fund flows can

12 This categorisation goes back in particular to the work 
of Calvo et al. (1993). The authors found empirical evi -
dence that international variables were especially signifi -
cant as drivers of Latin American fund flows. Since then, 
the categorisation of drivers into push and pull factors has 
been used in many studies. This approach is not above criti -
cism, however. This strict differentiation means that certain 
causes of portfolio flows, such as spillover effects between 
two countries, are not captured (see Koepke (2019) and 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2020a)).Deutsche Bundesbank

to this approach, push factors lead to simultan -
eous and unidirectional changes in fund flows 
into different countries, while pull factors relate 
solely to fund flows into the country in ques -
tion.13
However, in some ways, push and pull factors 
have a very close economic relationship with 
one another. It is therefore possible for one 
and the same variable to act as a push factor 
from a global perspective and as a pull factor 
from a country- specific perspective. An ex -
ample of this is economic activity. While global 
economic activity is clearly a push factor, na -
tional economic activity represents a pull factor. 
The two factors are related, however: eco -
nomic developments in large countries such as 
China or the United States have a significant 
impact on global economic activity as well. 
Conversely, economic activity in small open 
economies is crucially dependent on global 
economic activity. Analytically, it is thus all but 
impossible to draw a clear line between these 
two factors.
Certain push and pull factors may indeed influ -
ence portfolio flows in the same direction. This 
is because domestic and foreign investments 
are not necessarily in competition with each 
other. Instead, investors first decide whether 
they want to invest at all and then have the op -
portunity to diversify their investments across 
borders depending on their strategy and the 
economic environment. As a result, unidirec -
tional movements in push and pull factors can 
lead to unidirectional changes in fund flows 
domestically and abroad.
Both global and country- specific economic de -
velopments influence fund flows into individual 
countries. From a macroeconomic perspective, 
strong economic growth increases expected re -
turns and reduces investment risks; it therefore 
also leads to higher investment activity. The 
contribution of global economic growth in -
creases with the strength of international trade 
and financial market linkages. Various empirical 
studies provide indications that growth in the global economy acts as a push factor.14 How -
ever, the evidence on this matter is mixed. The 
relationship between the development of the 
global economy and capital flows appears to 
depend on how the respective model is speci -
fied and the region under consideration. Other 
studies find no statistically significant correl -
ation whatsoever.15 What is clearer is the sig -
nificance of country- specific economic devel -
opments as a pull factor – it is clearly positive, 
so it supports capital flows into a country.16 
Nevertheless, the correlation is less significant 
in studies with high frequency data on port -
folio flows.17
In addition to current economic developments, 
expectations regarding the future path of the 
economy also play an important role in port -
folio flows. Equity markets are a good proxy for 
these expectations because firms’ equity prices 
are influenced by their discounted expected 
earnings. Accordingly, rising equity prices can 
be interpreted as an indication that market par -
ticipants have positive expectations, while fall -
ing equity prices are typically associated with 
negative expectations. Economically speaking, 
this means that capital flows into individual 
countries should be positively correlated with 
how prices evolve in the local equity market 
(pull factor). However, global sentiment in 
equity markets is also likely to generally in -
crease the propensity to invest in this form of 
investment and thus push up demand for equi -Differentiation

13 On this point, Koepke (2019) also identifies a link to 
portfolio theory according to Markowitz (1952).
14 Some studies refer only to economic growth in ad -
vanced economies. This accounts for the bulk of global 
economic growth in statistical terms, however.
15 See, for example, Baek (2006), Bettendorf and Karadim -
itropoulou (2022) and De Vita and Kyaw (2008).
16 International trade and financial market linkages mean 
that, in practice, global and country- specific economic 
growth are often strongly correlated. In order to determine 
the significance of country- specific economic growth for 
fund flows, this first needs to be adjusted for the global 
economic component using statistical methods. In doing 
so, different estimation approaches may yield different re -
sults.

ties in all countries (push factor).18 Empirical 
studies find statistically significant evidence of 
correlations between equity market move -
ments and fund flows, though it is mainly stud -
ies based on relatively high frequency data that 
are able to demonstrate the existence of strong 
correlations here.19 This is plausible insofar as 
equity market movements, unlike economic 
data, can be mapped at a very high frequency, 
which gives them potentially greater short-  
term significance for investors.
An increased perception of risk can, for ex -
ample, be caused by economic and financial 
crises or political disputes. Here, a distinction 
should be made between global risks and 
country- specific risks. Given the particular im -
portance of the United States for global finan -
cial conditions, US risk indicators are often used 
as a proxy for global risk assessment in the 
financial markets.20
Uncertainty in the financial markets is typically 
reflected in increased volatility of equity re -
turns. The degree of uncertainty can, for ex -
ample, be derived from option prices and de -
picted using volatility indices such as the CBOE 
Volatility Index (VIX) for the S&P 500 stock 
index.21 Furthermore, yield spreads have be -
come established in the literature as a measure 
of risk. Well- known indicators of global risk in -
clude the TED spread (spread between the 
three-  month LIBOR and three-  month Treasury 
bills) and Moody’s Baa-  Aaa spread (spread be -
tween US corporate bonds with the corres -
ponding ratings). While the TED spread serves 
as an indicator of risks in the interbank market, 
the Baa-  Aaa spread represents risks across the 
entire corporate sector.
Country- specific risks can be derived in an 
analogous manner, for example from national 
measures of volatility. In periods of heightened 
uncertainty, investors tend to sell off the af -
fected portfolio investments. Accordingly, port -
folio investment outflows are to be expected if 
the perception of risk increases. Where securi -
tised credit default swaps (CDS) are available, their prices may also provide an indication of 
specific risks.
The empirical evidence lends weight to this hy -
pothesis. A rise in the global risk assessment 
– expressed as changes in the VIX – is nega -
tively correlated with the global flows to invest -
ment funds and is therefore a significant push 
factor. At the same time, such a rise is typically 
accompanied by increased demand for secur -
ities from the United States or other countries 
that are deemed to be comparatively safe (safe 
haven flows). As the VIX is derived from the US 
equity market, it is not surprising that its effects 
appear to play a particular role in equity trans -
actions in advanced economies. In addition, 
evidence for alternative risk measures such as 
the TED spread and the Baa-  Aaa spread can be 
found in studies analysing portfolio flows 
around the time of the global financial crisis. 
These studies show that increased demand for 
US securities can be observed even in cases 
where a global crisis originated in the United 
States.22
Portfolio flows are also influenced by country-  
specific measures of risk. Empirical studies 
show that external debt, the quality of political 
and financial institutions, and the assessments 
of rating agencies play a significant role as pull 
factors.23 An increase in country- specific risk 
thus impedes further capital inflows while 
boosting capital outflows.There are risk

18 In the case of investment funds, this would be immedi -
ately evident from an increase in flows into equity funds. 
For balance of payments statistics, this would translate into 
an increase in cross- border purchases by non- banks, pos -
sibly supported by an increase in issuance.
19 See Bettendorf and Karadimitropoulou (2022), Chuhan 
et al. (1998), Fratzscher (2012), Froot et al. (2001) or Lo 
Duca (2012).
20 This relationship is discussed in the literature under the 
concept of the “global financial cycle”. See Rey (2013).
21 The term “risk” is also used below as a synonym for 
“uncertainty”. Here it does not mean risk in terms of the 
specific probability of losing capital (value at risk), but 
rather  the intensity of price fluctuations in the equity mar -
kets.

Another significant driver of portfolio flows are 
commodity prices.24 They are a key cost factor, 
especially in the production of goods. While 
enterprises’ dependence on commodity prices 
varies considerably across countries and sec -
tors, increases in commodity prices neverthe -
less lead to higher costs and thus reduce enter -
prises’ competitiveness and profits – except in 
the case of commodity exporters. As a result, it 
becomes less lucrative to finance production 
projects of the affected enterprises or to invest 
in these firms. In such an economic environ -
ment, it is to be expected that investors would 
offload portfolio investments, especially ones 
involving commodity- intensive production.
Empirical studies show that this relationship 
can be demonstrated across different estima -
tion approaches. However, this driver does not 
act in the same direction for all countries. This 
is because commodity exporters tend to bene -
fit from rising commodity prices, as price in -
creases have a positive impact on earnings. 
Here, results indicate that the relationship has a 
greater impact on advanced economies.25 This 
effect can be seen especially in relation to com -
modity cycles and has, for example, also been 
discussed in the economic policy debate on 
global imbalances.26
Impact of US monetary policy 
on international portfolio 
flows
Portfolio flows in advanced economies and 
emerging market economies are strongly influ -
enced by the international interest rate envir -
onment. As interest rates are an important 
monetary policy instrument, the role of monet -
ary policy will be examined in more detail here. 
The focus is on monetary policy in the United 
States, as it significantly impacts financial con -
ditions around the world.27
One possible transmission channel is through 
investors’ search for yield and appetite for risk. 
A tightening of monetary policy in the United States leads directly to higher yields on US debt 
securities. Moreover, it typically reduces invest -
ors’ risk appetite, as a given yield target can 
then be achieved with a less risky investment 
instrument (e.g. government bonds versus 
equities or US equities versus emerging market 
equities).28 Owing to higher interest rates, on 
the one hand, and investors’ lower risk appe -
tite, on the other, investments in US securities 
therefore become more attractive, leading to 
portfolio shifts at the global level.
Empirical analyses confirm the effects of mon -
etary policy on portfolio flows. They indicate 
that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy af -
fects fund flows both in advanced economies 
and emerging market economies.29 In this con -
text, even the mere expectations of a monetary 
policy measure have a significant impact.30
In addition to the pure monetary policy impulse 
itself, the central bank can also send an infor -
mation signal in press releases or press confer -
ences by disclosing assessments of economic 
developments that represent new, surprising 
information for investors.31 While a positive 
outlook would also lead to higher yields in the 
United States, it would also increase investors’ 
risk appetite and simultaneously raise the ex -
pectation of positive spillover effects from the 
United States to the rest of the world. This 
would then result in rising gross inflows of 
funds to other countries as well. The positive 
information impulse thus leads to market reac -
tions that are very similar to the effects of an 
increase in aggregate demand.

tioning of these two channels shows that the Rising commod -

Impact of US monetary policy on international portfolio 
fl  ows
International portfolio fl  ows are infl  uenced 
by different drivers, which the literature 
usually breaks down into international 
“push” factors and country- specifi  c “pull” 
factors. One key structural driver is monet-
ary policy in the United States, which ranks 
as a global determinant, or push factor, 
owing to the special role the United States 
plays in shaping fi  nancial conditions world-
wide.
Empirical evidence indicates that a tighten-
ing of monetary policy in the United States 
leads to outfl  ows of funds in the rest of the 
world, especially in emerging market econ-
omies.1 This box takes a closer look at how 
exactly US monetary policy infl  uences port-
folio investment around the world, given 
that central banks infl  uence capital markets 
not only by means of monetary policy 
measures themselves, but also via what are 
known as central bank information shocks. 
When central banks present their decisions 
and explain them in press releases or at 
press conferences, they also explicitly or im-
plicitly share their own assessment of the 
economic outlook, which for investors 
might contain a new and surprising piece of 
information.
The effects of both these shocks –  “pure 
policy” shocks and central bank information 
shocks  – on portfolio fl  ows can be esti-
mated using proxy VAR models.2 These 
models use instrument variables to identify 
the two shocks. Kerssenfi  scher (2019) 
shows how these instrument variables can 
be generated from high frequency data, 
using the scenario of a Eurosystem monet-
ary policy shock. Applied to a monetary pol-
icy shock in the United States, the approach 
is based on changes in the two- year US government bond yield and percentage 
changes in the S&P 500 index within a rela-
tively narrow window around announce-
ments by the Federal Open Market Com-
mittee (FOMC). For the purposes of this an-
alysis, the window is the day of the an-
nouncement: closing prices on the day of 
the announcement are compared with clos-
ing prices on the day before the announce-
ment.3 Thus, the investigation is based on 
the assumption that movements in equity 
prices and bond yields on the day of the 
FOMC announcement are driven primarily 
by the announcement itself. A (pure) policy 
shock can be expected to send equity prices 
and bond yields in different directions: 
taken in isolation, a contractionary monet-
ary policy shock is likely to push up interest 
rates and dampen economic activity, prob-
ably causing bond yields to rise and equity 
prices to fall. A central bank information 
shock, by contrast, generally moves both 
variables in the same direction. Hence, a 
positive information shock – that is, an un-
expectedly upbeat outlook for investors – 
can be expected not only to lead to rising 
interest rate expectations and bond yields, 
as with a pure policy shock, but also to 
have a positive effect on equity prices at the 
same time.
1 See, inter alia, Anaya et al. (2017), Ciminelli (2022), 
Kalemli- Özcan (2019) and Koepke (2018).
2 See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2020b).
3 Kerssenfi  scher (2019) uses a window of just a few 
minutes around announcements. This approach tends 
to improve the identifi  cation of shocks because it also 
means the effect can be disentangled from informa-
tion that becomes known on the same day as the 
monetary policy decisions but at different times. How-
ever, this makes it more diffi   cult for researchers with-
out access to such data to replicate the results. Com-
parisons between shocks from high frequency data 
and daily data have shown that, in the present case, 
daily data provide tools that are good enough to 
clearly identify the shocks.Deutsche Bundesbank

Proxy VAR models are estimated using 
monthly data for the period from August 
2005 to December 2021. These models are 
fed with variables that capture key elem-
ents of the US capital market: the S&P 500 
composite index, the US dollar’s nominal 
effective exchange rate (NEER), the VIX 
volatility index and the yields of US govern-
ment bonds with a residual maturity of two 
years. In addition, a variable is added to 
each model to represent fund fl  ows of in-
vestment funds investing in a given region 
and asset class.4 Fund fl  ow data are sourced 
from EPFR Global and serve as a proxy for 
balance of payments statistics on inter-national portfolio investment, which are 
available at only a relatively low frequency 
in many countries.5 The models are esti-
mated using Bayesian methods.
The estimation results produced by the VAR 
models are presented in the form of im-
4 The regions analysed here are advanced economies 
and emerging market economies. Economies are cat-
egorised according to their EPFR Global classifi  cation. 
The asset classes analysed here are equity funds and 
bond funds.
5 EPFR data and balance of payments statistics are not 
exactly the same in conceptual terms. One reason for 
discrepancies between the data is that the EPFR data 
also capture transactions by residents, which are omit-
ted from the balance of payments statistics.Monetary policy effects on selected fund flows*

pulse response functions of the fund fl  ows 
in each case. The shocks are scaled such 
that the median of the posterior distribu-
tion of two- year yields increases by 25 basis 
points. This way, the effects of a contrac-
tionary monetary policy shock can be com-
pared with those of a positive central bank 
information shock. Fund fl  ow responses are 
summarised in the chart on p. 48, which 
shows the respective estimated changes in 
fund fl  ows compared with total net assets 
at the start of the period in percentage 
points.6
The monetary policy shock triggers immedi-
ate and signifi  cant declines in the fund 
fl  ows into bond funds investing in advanced 
economies (1.1 percentage points; median) 
and emerging market economies (3.6 per-
centage points). Hence, the effects in emer-
ging market economies are signifi  cantly 
stronger.7 The picture is mixed for equity 
funds, however, for two reasons. First, the 
evidence of a decline in fund fl  ows into 
advanced  economies is not signifi  cant. 
Second, the results indicate a signifi  cant in-
crease in fund fl  ows into emerging market 
economies. One possible reason for this ob-
servation could be reallocations into funds 
with higher risk premia in emerging market 
economies.
A much more uniform picture is presented 
by the estimation results for fund fl  ows fol-
lowing a positive central bank information 
shock. A positive shock of this kind causes 
fund fl  ows to increase signifi  cantly, irre-
spective of region (advanced economies 
versus emerging market economies) and 
asset class (equities versus bonds). Here 
again, fund fl  ows into bond funds investing 
in emerging market economies show a 
much stronger response than those focused 
on advanced economies: the information 
shock causes fund fl  ows into emerging 
market economies to increase by 3.4 per-centage points, while those into advanced 
economies rise by 1.1 percentage points. As 
regards equity funds, the responses are sig-
nifi  cantly smaller and smoother, with fund 
fl  ows into advanced and emerging market 
economies increasing by 0.3 and 0.4 per-
centage point, respectively.
The results show the importance of specify-
ing a monetary policy shock as precisely as 
possible, because a pure policy shock can 
affect capital fl  ows differently than a central 
bank information shock, even though both 
shocks induce an interest rate rise in the 
specifi  cation shown. If, for example, the 
role of monetary policy were identifi  ed only 
via an exogenous rise in interest rates, the 
estimation results could be distorted and re-
sult in incorrect economic policy conclu-
sions being drawn.
6 Total net assets at the start of a period will not ne-
cessarily match those at the end of the previous one 
because new funds may have been added to the sam-
ple.

effects, approximated by flows to investment 
funds, can vary considerably (see the box on 
p. 47).32 The impulses in the study lead to an 
assumed increase in interest rates of 25 basis 
points in each case. However, a contractionary 
monetary policy impulse causes investors to re -
duce their investments in bond funds, while a 
positive information impulse leads to increased 
inflows of funds. It makes no difference here 
whether the funds invest in advanced or emer -
ging market economies.
In emerging market economies, the effects are 
much greater still:33 a pure monetary policy im -
pulse in the United States leads to a simultan -
eous decline in flows to bond funds in emer -
ging market economies, equivalent to 3.6% of 
holdings. In advanced economies, this decrease 
amounts to 1.1% of holdings. New information 
results in a similar pattern among these two 
groups of economies, albeit with an inverted 
sign. In this case, flows to bond funds in emer -
ging market economies increase by around 
3.4% and in advanced economies by 1.1% of 
their holdings. As a result, this means that 
models that do not distinguish between the 
two channels only partially capture the impact 
of monetary policy on cross- border purchases 
of debt securities, or even provide a distorted 
picture.
With regard to equity funds, the results are less 
consistent. While new, positively received infor -
mation does lead to an increase in fund flows 
in both groups of economies, monetary policy 
impulses trigger a decline in fund flows only in 
advanced economies. In emerging market 
economies, fund flows are seen to increase, 
which may be attributable to shifts toward 
funds with higher risk premia in emerging mar -
ket economies.Time variation in the import -
ance of drivers of international 
portfolio flows
In the above considerations, it was implicitly 
assumed  that the importance of the various 
drivers of portfolio flows remained constant 
over time, and any variation in their specific in -
fluence over time was not taken into consider -
ation. However, this assumption may be too re -
strictive, for example due to information asym -
metries, heterogeneity amongst investors, 
budget constraints, and reappraisals of risks. 
Moreover, in the case of individual variables, 
certain thresholds also play an important role.34
Information asymmetries: If the supply and de -
mand sides possess different information about 
the intrinsic value of a security, it is not possible 
for the market to clear completely. The drivers 
of portfolio flows would shift depending on 
whether there is excess supply or demand.35
Heterogeneous investors: Domestic and for -
eign investors may have different investment 
motives. A change in the importance of individ -
ual drivers may therefore reflect the activity of 
different groups of investors.36
Budget constraints: Investors are, to some ex -
tent, tied to the specific risk profiles of man -
aged portfolios. If the relevant specifications 
are violated, for example, due to financial mar -
ket stress, this can lead to assets being sold off 
in the financial markets, which in turn can trig -
ger further selling. As a result, the importance 
of risk measures may grow over time.37
Reappraisal of risks: Investors and economists 
learn from economic changes. For example, Bundesbank

32 Flows to investment funds are generally used as a proxy 
for portfolio flows. The advantage of these data is that 
they are available at a relatively high frequency and earlier 
than the official balance of payments statistics.

Variation in the importance of push and pull factors for 
portfolio fl  ows over time
The extent to which portfolio fl  ows are in-
fluenced by international (push) and 
country- specifi  c (pull) factors has already 
been subject to both comprehensive and 
controversial discussion in the economic lit-
erature. A discussion paper recently pub-
lished by the Bundesbank investigates the 
question of how the importance of these 
factors changes over time.1 To this end, a 
Bayesian dynamic factor model with time- 
varying coeffi   cients and time- varying sto-
chastic volatility is estimated.2 This model 
can be used to explain not only when cer-
tain factors were important for individual 
countries in the past, but also which factors 
are important at present. The approach is 
based on the idea that capital fl  ows to indi-
vidual countries can be broken down into a 
common component and a country- specifi  c 
component. In this context, the model ac-
counts for the fact that the weights of these 
components can shift over time. The com-
mon component is interpreted as a push 
factor and the country- specifi  c component 
is interpreted as a pull factor.
For the analysis, portfolio fl  ows are approxi-
mated using fl  ows to investment funds, as 
these data are available earlier and at a 
higher frequency than balance of payments 
data. Monthly data on 26 emerging market 
economies and 21 advanced economies 
from EPFR Global are used for this pur-
pose.3 The observation period extends from 
August 2005 to September 2020. The in-
vestigation distinguishes between capital 
fl  ows to advanced economies and those to 
emerging market economies. In addition, 
the data allow a distinction to be made be-
tween equity funds and bond funds. This 
results in four different variations, for each 
of which a factor model is estimated.
The objective of the factor model is to break 
down each individual time series under ob-
servation (yi,t) into a common component, factor (ft), and a country- specifi  c compon-
ent, residual (/uni03F5.stsi,t):
yi,t=ai+bi,tft+✏i,t .
The indices i  and t  represent the country 
and period under observation, respectively. 
The constant ( ai) refers to the specifi  c 
country in question and is not time- 
dependent. By contrast, the factor can have 
a different impact on the respective fund 
fl  ows for each country and at each point in 
time. The sensitivity of the fund fl  ows to the 
factor is determined by the time- varying 
parameter bi,t, which is assumed to follow a 
random walk:
bi,t=bi,t1+σ⌘i⌘i,t .
The intensity of the time variation is defi  ned 
by the term σηiηi,t, where σηi describes the 
variance and ηi,t ~N(0,1)  is true.
Both the factor and the country- specifi  c 
component follow autoregressive processes 
of order p = 2 and q = 3 :4
ft=0,1ft1+...+0,qftq+eh0,tu0,t
✏i,t=φi,1✏i,t1+...+φi,p✏i,tp+σiehi,tui,t .
Here, u0,t and ui,t are the respective error 
terms. The autoregressive dynamics of the 
factor and the country- specifi  c components 
are described using the parameters /uni03D5. In 
addition, the model also accounts for vari-
1 See Bettendorf and Karadimitropoulou (2022).
2 See Del Negro and Otrok (2008).
3 These fund data differ from balance of payments 
data in that they cover only a subset of the total port-
folio fl  ows and, at the same time, depict the total 
fl  ows to funds that invest in a given country. This 
means that they also cover funds invested by residents.
4 The number of time lags corresponds to the specifi  -
cation in Del Negro and Otrok (2008). The lags ac-
count for the assumption that both the common and 
country- specifi  c components represent macroeco-
nomic variables as drivers of portfolio fl  ows.Deutsche Bundesbank

ation in the volatility ( hi,t) of the compon-
ents over time, which follows a random 
walk:
hi,t=hi,t1+σ⇣i⇣i,t ,
where σζi describes the variance and ζi,t 
~N(0,1)  is true.
The estimated factors (ft) in the four models 
are shown in the adjacent chart. Both the 
global fi  nancial crisis in 2008 and the fi  nan-
cial market turmoil at the start of the 
COVID- 19 pandemic in March 2020 are 
captured by all of the models in the com-
mon push factors. This suggests that the 
model correctly recognises global events 
and allocates them to the appropriate fac-
tor.
However, the key question of this analysis 
is: “To what extent does each factor infl  u-
ence the fl  ow of funds to each country?”. 
In order to answer this question, the vari-
ance in fund fl  ows is broken down into the 
contributions of each factor. The table on 
p. 52 shows the relative contribution of each 
factor to the variance in fl  ows to equity and 
bond funds in selected countries. In this 
case, this approach reveals a high degree of 
heterogeneity with regard to the relative 
importance of factors within different re-
gions and asset classes. The table shows 
the shares of the variance in each fund fl  ow 
that can be explained by push and pull fac-
tors at various points in time for selected 
countries. For example, the relative import-
ance of push factors for portfolio fl  ows to 
advanced economies has increased over 
time – this holds especially true for EU 
Member States. With regard to portfolio 
fl  ows in emerging market economies, the 
results vary signifi  cantly by region (ad-
vanced versus emerging market economies) 
and asset class (equities versus bonds).
One advantage of this approach is that it is 
agnostic when determining the inter-
national and country- specifi  c drivers. Com-
monalities are interpreted as push factors, 
whilst all other aspects are considered to be pull factors. This means that the factors are 
calculated in a purely statistical manner, 
which implicitly also takes account of vari-
ables that are unknown in the literature. For 
this reason, the results may differ from 
studies that focus on the importance of in-
dividual drivers.5
The model class presented here provides 
deep insight into the portfolio fl  ows under 
observation not only with regard to their 
cross- section, but also into how they 
change over time. However, this compre-
hensive picture comes at a cost. Due to the 
considerable number of different param-
eters, the estimates are subject to a com-
paratively high level of uncertainty. This 
should be taken into consideration when 
interpreting the results.

the global financial crisis also led to changes in 
modelling. Since the crisis, much more atten -
tion has been given to the real estate markets 
and the banking sector than had been before.
Thresholds: Certain variables may gain or lose 
importance for international capital flows if 
they exceed or fall short of specific thresholds. 
For example, foreign currency reserves contrib -
ute to the external stability of an economy, but, 
if holdings exceed a certain threshold, they 
may become less relevant as a variable for in -
vestors.
It should therefore come as no surprise to find 
empirical evidence of shifts in the importance 
of drivers of portfolio flows. Nevertheless, the 
estimation methods for such matters are much 
more complex and have only recently gained in 
popularity.
Before time variation was explicitly mapped in 
models, studies simply looked at individual time 
periods separately. For example, Fratzscher 
(2012) found that portfolio flows were heavily 
influenced by international drivers such as the 
TED spread at the time of the global financial 
crisis, while individual country- specific drivers 
gained in importance later on. In addition, the 
study also points to differences in the import -
ance of drivers amongst individual countries. 
The fact that countries react to individual 
drivers to differing degrees can, for example, 
be attributed to the quality of institutions, 
country- specific risk, or macroeconomic funda -
mentals.
Lo Duca (2012) published one of the first stud -
ies on portfolio flows to explicitly model time 
variation and found evidence of a change in 
the importance of individual drivers. In this 
context, the study established connections be -
tween flows and specific variables including 
confidence, credit risk in the interbank market, 
and regional developments in emerging market 
economies. The results of the study point to 
significant changes in the importance of indi -
vidual drivers. Prior to the global financial crisis, the regional macroeconomic environment 
played an important role in portfolio equity 
flows to emerging market economies. How -
ever, following the collapse of the US invest -
ment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, there 
was a significant withdrawal of equity portfolio 
investment from these countries. According to 
Lo Duca’s model, a loss of confidence among 
market participants set in at this time, leading 
to a change in the importance of individual 
drivers of portfolio flows.
A study recently published by the Bundesbank 
analyses the relative importance of push and 
pull factors for portfolio flows.38 The study 
does not examine individual drivers, however, 
but instead statistically determines pull factors 
and push factors from the flows and views 
each set of factors collectively (see the box on 
p. 51). This approach is agnostic as far as the 
specific factors are concerned. The advantage 
of this is that no material determinants are 
overlooked. The results suggest that time vari -
ation is of particular significance, with a high 
degree of heterogeneity in the importance of 
the factors within different regions (advanced 
economies versus emerging market economies) 
and asset classes (equities versus bonds). For 
example, the importance of push factors for 
portfolio flows in many advanced economies 
has increased significantly over time – espe -
cially in EU Member States. By contrast, with 
respect to flows into emerging market econ -
omies, the picture is very heterogeneous.
Conclusion
Portfolio flows are a key factor in the external 
interconnectedness of economies as well as in 
their economic development. This is because 
they contribute, amongst other things, to an 
efficient allocation of capital, enable investors 
to diversify their risk, and allow risk to be 
shared in the event of unforeseen events. How -

close interconnectedness can also lead to ex -
ternal dependencies and help economic crises 
to spread more quickly. From an economic pol -
icy perspective, a sound understanding of the 
main drivers of capital flows is therefore essen -
tial.
Which variables have the greatest impact on 
portfolio flows depends on a number of cri -
teria. The level of development (advanced 
economies versus emerging market economies) 
and the asset class (equities versus bonds) play 
key roles here. At the superordinate level, the 
respective drivers can be divided into global 
factors (push factors) and country- specific fac -
tors (pull factors). However, individual drivers 
affect portfolio flows both from a global eco -
nomic perspective and from a country-  specific 
perspective. In addition to other factors, such 
as economic developments, monetary policy 
also plays an important role, as it has a signifi -
cant impact on the international interest rate 
environment and the risk assessment in the 
financial markets.
The results presented here suggest that the US 
Federal Reserve, in particular, has a significant 
impact on international portfolio flows (meas -
ured in terms of fund flows) through both pure 
monetary policy impulses as well as informa -
tion impulses. A tightening of monetary policy 
that leads to an increase in the interest rate level in the United States can therefore influ -
ence investors’ investment behaviour in differ -
ent ways. While the monetary policy impulse, 
and the more challenging financing conditions 
for enterprises associated with this impulse, 
mean that there will tend to be a decline in 
flows to bond funds, the information impulse 
acts in the opposite direction. This is because 
the interest rate hike can be interpreted as a 
signal from the central bank that it expects an 
economic upturn. The impact of both impulses 
is stronger in emerging market economies than 
in advanced economies. For equity funds, the 
results are inconsistent.
Moreover, the importance of push and pull fac -
tors appears to be subject to significant time 
variation. For example, estimation results indi -
cate a high degree of heterogeneity with re -
gard to the importance of factors in different 
regions (advanced versus emerging market 
economies) and asset classes (equities versus 
bonds). The importance of push factors for 
portfolio flows in many advanced economies 
has increased over time – especially in EU Mem -
ber States. With respect to portfolio flows to 
emerging market economies, the results are 
highly heterogeneous between individual coun -
tries. This is in line with the academic literature, 
which indicates that investors are increasingly 
differentiating between individual emerging 
market economies.

Cross- border interoperability of central 
bank digital currency
The digitalisation of the economy, flourishing online commerce, global supply chains and migra -
tion are making cross- border payments more and more important. Compared with domestic 
transactions, payments across the borders of currency areas are more expensive, slower, less 
widely accessible and less transparent. This is particularly true of payments by individuals and 
enterprises. Central bank digital currency (CBDC) could help to overcome these obstacles.
As CBDC would inevitably necessitate the development of new infrastructures, it could act as a 
catalyst for enhancements in the cross- border payments space. Examples of such improvements 
would be the use of common message standards along the entire payment chain and faster 
settlement due to shorter process chains made up of fewer participants. Likewise, CBDC could 
present an opportunity to integrate currency exchange functionality into payment settlement. 
CBDC for financial institutions (wholesale CBDC) could also improve liquidity management in 
cross- border payments. In addition, programmable interfaces could help to link CBDC systems 
with one another or with other financial market infrastructures.
A multilateral approach is most likely to enable CBDC to help reduce the frictions currently ham -
pering cross- border payments. This would involve central banks providing CBDC for use in their 
own currency area, but facilitating cross- border payments through interoperability of their own 
CBDC infrastructure with other payment systems. Such an approach would avert the macroeco -
nomic risks associated with a unilateral approach whereby, outside of its domestic market, a cur -
rency area’s CBDC would be held and used as a foreign currency. Depending on the extent of 
cooperation, a multilateral approach in the form of compatible systems, interlinked systems or a 
common platform could open up varying degrees of potential for faster, cheaper and more trans -
parent payment settlement.
A higher degree of interoperability requires close cooperation between the central banks involved. 
Differences in legislation and national standards for data handling or cyber security provisions 
can hinder efforts towards greater interoperability. Differing national interests, fears over losing 
autonomy and control, and a lack of confidence in joint governance structures may also pose 
barriers to increased international cooperation.
The G20 countries have set 2027 as their target date for improving cross- border payments. As 
things currently stand, CBDC is unlikely to be able to make a meaningful contribution in the near 
future. In the medium term, however, the development of CBDC will provide a favourable foun -
dation for establishing interoperability between payment systems through stronger cooperation 
among central banks; this offers prospects for mitigating the effects of the global retreat of cor -
respondent banks. For that to come to fruition, central banks’ work to develop CBDCs needs to 
be geared towards international usage and common standards from the outset.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
A combination of factors has driven a dynamic 
evolution in international payments over recent 
years.1 Irrespective of the current disruptions, 
global supply chains have led to a growing 
number of payments between firms in different 
countries. Increasing migration generally leads 
to a growing number of credit transfers being 
made by migrants to family members in their 
home countries (referred to as remittances) 
that constitute a significant inflow of funds for 
numerous countries relative to gross domestic 
product (GDP). New modes of working, in -
creasing international tourism and the rise in 
international trade fuelled, in part, by e-  
commerce are making cross- border retail pay -
ments more and more important.2 However, 
when it comes to settlement, which is predom -
inantly conducted via correspondent banks and 
money transfer services (such as Western 
Union, MoneyGram and the like), there is sig -
nificant room for improvement.3 With this in mind, talk has now also turned to whether and 
how CBDC might contribute to efficiency gains.
For some years now, cross- border payments 
have additionally been suffering from the com -
plete or partial retreat of financial institutions 
from correspondent banking activities in an ef -
fort to de- risk. Business relationships have been 
terminated, with the mounting costs of regula -
tory compliance being one of the motivating 
factors. The number of such links has fallen by 
almost one- fifth since 2011 and has made for 
significantly weaker competition. Particularly 
hard hit by the decline in correspondent bank -
ing relationships have been the regions of Af -
rica, Latin America and Oceania, where some 
countries are heavily dependent on incoming 
remittances.4
Diminishing competitive intensity could ultim -
ately lead to higher prices. There is also the risk 
that payment channels between certain coun -
tries will end up shut down altogether, leaving 
some regions entirely cut off from global pay -
ments. Last but not least, the dwindling of cor -
respondent banking relationships could fuel re -
course to payment channels that are less closely 
regulated and monitored (e.g. cash transfers or 
crypto- tokens).
Frictions in cross- border 
payments  and objectives 
for reducing them
Settlement of domestic payments has improved 
significantly in many countries in recent years; 
by contrast, cross- border payments are gener -
ally more expensive, slower, less transparent 
and are often only accessible to a smaller set of 
users than domestic payments. Having said 
that, this does not hold true for payments

gone into integrating national payment sys -
tems and creating a single European market for 
payments.
As part of its work to enhance cross-  border 
payments, the Financial Stability Board (FSB)5 
has pinpointed areas of friction that play a 
major role in the existing inefficiencies, which 
include high costs, low speed, limited access 
and limited transparency.6
– Fragmented and incomplete data: the use of 
fragmented data formats for the transmis -
sion of payment data means that important 
information – such as the know your cus -
tomer (KYC) data essential for verification of 
the payer or recipient – sometimes does not 
get transmitted or is only communicated in 
truncated form. This makes automating pay -
ment processing more difficult and pushes 
up the cost of the transaction if the payment 
requires some manual processing.– Complex compliance checks: different legal 
frameworks for the prevention of money 
laundering and terrorist financing lead to 
additional costs for the participants in the 
payment chain, and these are passed on to 
the end users.
– High liquidity costs: the complexity of the 
correspondent banking relationships be -
tween the institutions involved means the 
need for liquidity in various currencies is 
high; this entails commensurate costs.

action chains increase processing time and 
costs and make international payments less 
transparent.
Ultimately, these frictions also contribute to 
high barriers to market entry, resulting in the 
lack of competition in the cross-  border pay -
ments space that we have already mentioned.
In 2020, the G20 countries devised a roadmap 
with a view to addressing and eliminating the 
frictions described above. It consists of 19 
building blocks that fall into a total of five focus 
areas. These include global harmonisation of 
regulatory frameworks, improvements to data 
quality, the expansion of existing payment in -
frastructures and the development of new in -
frastructures, as well as the definition of a com -
mon vision for enhanced cross- border pay -
ments.
As part of this common vision, concrete object -
ives for the various segments of cross- border payments have already been set, with the tar -
get of achieving them by 2027 (see the overview 
above). They address payments between finan -
cial institutions as well as retail payments, plus 
remittances, which are usually listed separately.
The goal is for payments by individuals and 
businesses to not cost any more than 1% of the 
transaction value and for the cost of remit -
tances not to exceed 3% of the amount being 
transferred. Furthermore, 75% of all payments 
should be available to the payee within one 
hour. In addition, certain information is to be 
made transparent to payers and payees, such 
as the total cost of the transaction and the time 
it will take to settle.7 Alongside the efforts of 
central banks and legislators, private sector ini -
tiatives can also help to achieve the objectives 
set by the G20 countries.8G20 have for -

funds; (iii) tracking of payment status; and (iv) terms of service.

Central bank digital currency – 
a new start?
The crux of the structural problem with inter -
national payments lies in the fact that such 
payments have to pass through several domes -
tic payment systems with different designs 
(normally, the country where the payer is send -
ing the funds from and the country of the 
payee). On top of this, a bridge (e.g. in the 
form of correspondent banking) is usually ne -
cessary as well to provide the technical connec -
tion between both systems and, where neces -
sary, perform any currency exchange. Against 
this backdrop, investigations are currently 
under way looking at whether and how CBDC 
will open up options for creating new struc -
tures and thus the possibility of placing cross-  
border payments on a common footing.
Discussions around CBDC have gained notice -
able momentum in the last few years. A survey 
conducted by the Bank for International Settle -
ments (BIS) found that around 90% of the re -
spondent central banks are exploring CBDC. 
One- third are at the pilot phase or already in 
development.9 Work is going into both whole -
sale CBDC10 and retail CBDC.11 Initiatives are 
being motivated by different drivers in individ -
ual cases, with financial inclusion, monetary 
sovereignty and increased efficiency of domes -
tic payments among the reasons cited. How -
ever, the desire for more efficient cross- border 
payment transactions is also playing into the 
central banks’ efforts.
The Eurosystem is currently investigating the 
feasibility and possible design of a digital euro 
in the form of a retail CBDC. The ongoing in -
vestigation phase is set to run until October 
2023 and reach a conclusion as to whether a 
digital euro should actually be developed and 
issued.12
CBDC will not just be a means of payment; it 
will also require an infrastructure enabling issu -
ance and circulation. For CBDC to be used in 
cross- border transactions, establishing inter -operability between individual CBDC infrastruc -
tures is a must – in other words, they need to 
be able to work together as seamlessly as pos -
sible. Pilot phase CBDC projects being pion -
eered by central banks are concentrating on 
wholesale CBDC, with a focus on international 
payments in the interbank market (e.g. the 
Dunbar and mBridge projects described below). 
There are also initiatives in the private sector 
that are looking to create infrastructures for the 
cross- border use of wholesale CBDC (J. P . Mor -
gan Onyx,13 for instance).
Yet enhancing the cross- border payments land -
scape is also an important motivator behind re -
tail CBDC projects, especially for emerging mar -
ket and developing economies.14
However, the majority of retail CBDC projects 
are currently geared more towards domestic 
payments, as the development of CBDC, even 
in the domestic context, raises numerous issues 
of a conceptual, technical and legal nature. 
Moreover, the timeframes that most of the pro -
jects are working with are unlikely to be com -
patible with the deadline set in the G20 road -
map. Nevertheless, it is still imperative that 
cross- border payments be included from the 
outset in the thinking going into designing 
CBDC. The new CBDC systems will only be able 
to aid in enhancing cross- border payments in 
future if they are interoperable. As well as gen -
erating stiffer competition by offering an add -
itional settlement channel, CBDC and its unique 
technical design could enable efficiency gains CBDC is being

10 In this context, wholesale CBDC describes a CBDC 
which is primarily designed for use in payments between 
credit institutions/ financial market infrastructures.
11 Retail CBDC describes a CBDC which is designed to be 
used for payments by non- banks (e.g. the public, enter -
prises, public authorities).
12 The European Central Bank (ECB) is part of a consortium 
of eight central banks looking into the basic design of 
CBDC. Cross- border payments are one of the aspects feed -
ing into their considerations. See Bank for International 
Settlements (2020).

that are difficult – if not impossible – to attain 
using traditional instruments.
Ways in which central bank 
digital currency could 
mitigate  frictions
Some of these efficiency gains can be achieved 
through the “accelerant” effect of new sys -
tems, as they promote a reinvention of the sys -
tem landscape with the cross- border dimension 
in mind.15 The scope for improving existing sys -
tems could be limited if expanding their func -
tionality takes them to the bounds of what is 
technically feasible or if the costs of adapting 
them are higher than those of developing a 
new system. Meanwhile, the development of 
new payment settlement infrastructures can 
present a host of advantages that, over the 
medium term, outweigh the short- term invest -
ment costs. In many countries, CBDC systems 
are being developed precisely with the aim of 
increasing financial inclusion. This opens up the 
possibility of simultaneously expanding access 
to cross- border payments as well. Depending 
on how a given CBDC is designed, payment 
service providers that have so far been depend -
ent on the services of banks could take on a 
greater role in the settlement infrastructure. 
Banks, too, could provide new services. For 
those banks that engage in international cor -
respondent banking, the incentive to improve 
or participate in new systems would depend on 
how potential new income might measure up 
against the potential loss of previous business. 
Overall, competition at the customer interface 
could intensify and more innovative services 
could be offered.
Newly developed systems can ensure efficient 
and transparent data processing through, for 
example, the application of uniform messaging 
standards.16 This could cut down the need for 
(costly and time- consuming) manual interven -
tion at the individual stages of the payment 
chain. In addition, transactions could be settled 
directly and in real time.17 This would mean that payers and payees, in cross-  border pay -
ments especially, could receive confirmation of 
successful settlement in a matter of seconds, 
which would minimise costs associated with 
risk monitoring and hedging. That would dir -
ectly address two key challenges – a want of 
transparency and the high costs – where cross- 
border usability is concerned.
However, this would require currency exchange 
functions to be built into CBDC systems from 
the outset. This could be done, for example, via 
selected third parties or a market mechanism 
that is also incorporated into transaction settle -
ment in real time.18 Currency exchange in real 
time, enabled by the use of a wholesale CBDC, 
would – for example – serve to mitigate the 
issue of liquidity management in cross- border 
payments. In this way, wholesale CBDC could 
also support alternative private sector solutions 
for improving cross- border payments.
At the same time, new CBDC systems could en -
courage a harmonisation of legal frameworks 
or settlement standards. Besides the shared 
messaging standards19 already mentioned, that 
might include, for example, more homogen -
ised conditions for access to payment systems, 
harmonised rules for establishing settlement fi -
nality and extended operating hours for pay -
ment systems. CBDC could also prove to be a 
catalyst for digitalisation initiatives in the pay -
ments sphere.20 In the European Union, for in -
stance, CBDC forms part of the general digital -
isation strategy, which also includes the inter -
operability of digital identities. In ths context,

16 For example, ISO 20022, which establishes a uniform 
standard for payment messages.
17 In correspondent banking particularly, the large number 
of parties involved in settlement mean that transactions 
can sometimes be hard to track. It is not possible for the 
payer and payee to check the whereabouts of a payment 
at all given moments. SWIFT has just recently successfully 
introduced the SWIFT gpi initiative, providing better track -
ing of transactions in the SWIFT network.

ate a toolbox for the provision of digital iden -
tity wallets, which could also be used for pay -
ments and the digital euro.21
The implementation of open interfaces would 
offer further advantages. From a technical per -
spective, this could be done using, say, applica -
tion programming interfaces (APIs)22 or trigger 
solutions,23 enabling, for example, payment-  
versus- payment settlement in different curren -
cies. Payment- versus- payment settlement in 
international transactions minimises settlement 
risk for buyers and sellers, since the funds de -
nominated in different currencies change hands 
simultaneously.24 With the help of such setups, 
CBDC systems could be made interoperable 
without a huge amount of effort, or could sim -
plify international capital flows by means of 
linkages to securities settlement systems, for 
example. Open interfaces would also allow 
new CBDC systems in one country to be linked 
to traditional payment systems in another 
country. This could enable differences between 
countries and regions in terms of their develop -
ment paths and the solutions that they are pur -
suing to be accommodated.
International central bank 
digital currency: multilateral 
cooperation instead of 
unilateral  issuance
Many of the outlined opportunities of using 
CBDC to mitigate current frictions in cross-  
border payments assume a certain degree of 
international cooperation among central banks. 
A multilateral25 approach of this nature could, 
in particular, see participating central banks is -
suing local- currency CBDC to be primarily held 
by residents of their currency area.26 Cross-  
border payments would be made possible 
through the above- mentioned interoperability 
with other CBDC systems. By contrast, it would 
be possible to follow a fundamentally different 
approach, whereby central banks issue CBDC 
unilaterally and design it in such a way that it can be held across borders and be used inter -
nationally.
Under a unilateral approach, cross- border pay -
ments would therefore be made within a sin -
gle, closed payment system in a single, digital 
currency. There would be no need for inter -
operability with other CBDC systems in order to 
transfer money across national borders and no 
need for a currency exchange mechanism 
within the system. In practice, however, an op -
tion for converting foreign- currency CBDC into 
the respective national currency following a 
cross- border transaction would be required. 
Foreign payment service providers, for ex -
ample, would also have to maintain foreign-  
currency accounts. This could result in add -
itional costs for the end user, especially in situ -
ations where the foreign- currency CBDC could 
not be used to pay for goods and services 
abroad. A unilateral approach would therefore 
not be able to do away with a link to foreign 
payment systems entirely either; rather, such a 
link would be placed in the hands of private 
agents.27
In addition, from an economic perspective, a 
number of risks place a question mark over the 
usefulness of a unilateral approach. At first 
glance, these primarily concern those countries 
in which CBDC would be used as a foreign cur -
rency but, on closer inspection, also the cur -
rency area issuing the CBDC.

means of payment, for example a digital US Open interfaces

dollar in the euro area, the domestic economy 
would be more affected by foreign economic 
developments. Model- based analyses, for in -
stance, demonstrate that spillovers of eco -
nomic shocks to the domestic economy are 
amplified in such cases. Domestic monetary 
policy would then have to respond to external 
developments to an increasing degree in order 
to stabilise economic and price developments 
at home.28 At the same time, the scope for 
conducting effective monetary policy could be 
narrowed. To the extent that usage of CBDC as 
a means of payment also leads to the foreign 
currency being increasingly used as a unit of 
account at home, domestic monetary policy 
would lose force: if prices and wages are in -
creasingly expressed in foreign currency, it will 
become more and more difficult for the central 
bank to use monetary policy measures to influ -
ence domestic prices and economic activity.29 
Not least for this reason, a central bank’s uni -
lateral effort to ensure that its own CBDC can 
be used internationally could be perceived 
abroad as undermining domestic monetary 
policy autonomy.
However, the expanded use of CBDC abroad 
would also have significant consequences for 
the central bank issuing the CBDC that can be 
used internationally. As CBDC is a liability of the 
issuing central bank, demand for CBDC from 
abroad would generally further extend its bal -
ance sheet. As a consequence, balance sheet 
risks would tend to increase. If the central bank 
were to issue CBDC against a foreign currency, 
for example, and build up foreign- currency 
holdings accordingly, its balance sheet would 
be more vulnerable to exchange rate fluctu -
ations. In addition, such transactions would be 
the equivalent of foreign exchange market 
interventions at the expense of its own cur -
rency and, as such, subject to the commit -
ments pledged by the G7 Finance Ministers 
and Central Bank Governors.30 If, on the other 
hand, the central bank were to hold additional 
assets in its own currency, the value of its cur -
rency would tend to rise as a result of the add -
itional demand from abroad. This, in turn, could have negative consequences for the 
competitiveness of the domestic economy.31,32
If several central banks were to adopt a unilat -
eral approach at the same time, this could ul -
timately also have a knock- on effect on their 
own ability to conduct monetary policy. If each 
country’s CBDC is freely available abroad, 
foreign- currency means of payment would 
compete directly with domestic forms of 
money in all countries. Model- based analyses 
suggest that such currency competition could 
tend to lead to a convergence of interest rates Consequences

28 Ferrari Minesso et al. (2022) model the unilateral issu -
ance of CBDC abroad, which can also be used for domes -
tic payment purposes. As the foreign- currency CBDC in -
creases the stock of foreign- currency assets held by domes -
tic residents, any adjustment in response to exchange rate 
movements is stronger. This amplifies economic spillovers 
from the country issuing the CBDC and triggers a stronger 
domestic monetary policy response in the model.
29 Ikeda (2020) models such a “digital dollarisation” in 
which domestic prices and wages are denominated in for -
eign currency. Domestic monetary policy becomes less ef -
fective as digital dollarisation deepens, while the monetary 
policy of the foreign country that issues the digital currency 
used in the home country has a greater impact.
30 The communiqué from the G7 Finance Ministers’ and 
Central Bank Governors’ Meeting held in Bari, Italy, on 12 
and 13 May 2017 states: “1. […] We reaffirm our existing 
G7 exchange rate commitments to market determined ex -
change rates and to consult closely in regard to actions in 
foreign exchange markets. We reaffirm that our fiscal and 
monetary policies have been and will remain oriented to -
wards meeting our respective domestic objectives using 
domestic instruments and we will not target exchange 
rates for competitive purposes. We underscore the import -
ance of all countries refraining from competitive devalu -
ation […]”. In the London communiqué of 5 June 2021, 
the G7 reaffirmed their adherence to these commitments.
31 Even in such a case, additional balance sheet risks may 
arise for central banks. This occurs when the stock of safe 
assets in its own currency is limited, necessitating the hold -
ing of increasingly risky securities.
32 If issuing CBDC were to lead to prices and wages being 
chiefly denominated in the domestic currency abroad, too, 
a currency appreciation would not have a significant im -
pact on the domestic economy’s competitiveness. This is 
because, for countries that predominantly use the same 
currency as a unit of account and as a means of payment, 
exchange rate fluctuations in another currency, which is 
hardly used for these purposes anymore, are generally less 
important.Deutsche Bundesbank

between countries.33 Instead of increasing their 
own international monetary and economic pol -
icy influence, such a system could actually nar -
row the scope for all participating central banks 
to conduct an independent monetary policy. 
The impossible trinity of international economic 
policy34 could morph into a dilemma: although 
exchange rates could continue to fluctuate, 
were capital to move freely across borders, 
there would be less scope for independent 
monetary policy.
The above-  mentioned risks associated with a 
unilateral approach could, in principle, be miti -
gated by designing the CBDC appropriately.35 
Indeed, debate in the euro area on potential 
caps for holding a possible digital euro (holding 
limits), for example, suggests that such restric -
tions may also be necessary in an international 
context. If, for example, the volume of domes -
tic CBDC held abroad were to be strictly limited 
or if transactions were to be capped, the side 
effects would also be contained. Such restric -
tions, however, would run counter to the aim 
of using CBDC to address frictions in cross-  
border payments in the first place.
For these reasons, instead of proceeding unilat -
erally, a multilateral approach could prove bet -
ter suited to realising the potential of CBDC for 
cross- border payments. The participating cen -
tral banks would then issue CBDC primarily in 
their own currency area,36 but would make it 
interoperable across borders. Since large-  scale 
holding or use of CBDC in foreign currency 
would not be envisaged, the macroeconomic 
risks of a unilateral approach would not arise.
These considerations apply to both retail CBDC 
and wholesale CBDC. For example, all current 
projects that use wholesale CBDC to simplify 
cross-  border payments are characterised by 
strong multilateral approaches. These projects 
are also examining whether, for the purpose of 
simplifying payments, it would make sense to 
open up access to CBDC to foreign banks. If 
this were to happen, it would no longer be ne -
cessary to involve another bank in the recipient country. The experiments have generally shown 
that the issuing central bank would technically 
be able to obtain complete transparency about 
the CBDC held by foreign banks and implement 
various control and steering measures that en -

change rate of the currencies to each other. Benigno et al. 
(2022) show that, while the currencies of the individual 
countries therefore do not compete directly, they may well 
do so indirectly. Under the model assumptions, this leads to 
a forced convergence of bond yields, i.e. the opportunity 
cost of holding money, between countries if the agents 
maintain equilibrium holdings of both the crypto- token 
and the respective local currency. In the model, this could 
only be avoided if central banks were to deviate from inter -
est rate equality and lower their rates – which could lead 
them to the zero lower bound at which they would be un -
able to lower rates further. The outcome of this model can 
be applied to the context of international CBDC: if CBDC 
that can be used abroad were to compete directly with the 
respective domestic currency –  not indirectly through a 
global crypto-  token  – interest rates would also tend to 
converge. The more similar the various forms of money in 
the model are, i.e. the more substitutable they are as 
means of payment from the user’s perspective, the more 
this holds true.
34 In the economic literature of open economies, the im -
possible trinity describes the inability to simultaneously 
achieve the three potential objectives of free capital flows, 
fixed exchange rates and independent monetary policy.
35 In the model employed by Ferrari Minesso et al. (2022), 
described in footnote 28, for example, transaction restric -
tions for users of CBDC abroad mean that economic shocks 
from the country issuing the CBDC are transmitted less 
strongly across national borders.
36 Depending on the technical design, limiting the use of 
domestic CBDC to residents could be complex at an oper -
ational level, but so too would be implementing reliable 
identity and anti- money laundering controls for non-  
residents. If, for example, the CBDC is made available as a 
hardware token or in a purely decentralised network based 
on distributed ledger technology (DLT), it will be virtually 
impossible to restrict usage to a certain user group. By con -
trast, an account- based CBDC or a software token in a per -
missioned DLT network will enable usage to be restricted, 
for example, by refusing to open an account or set up a 
wallet as part of an identity check. Cross- border interoper -
ability is likely to ensure that restricting usage to residents 
is not perceived as unduly restricting the free flow of cap -
ital. It will also be essential to ensure that the differing 
ways of treating various forms of central bank money do 
not give rise to a difference in value between cash and 
CBDC. The points outlined here also apply to the unilateral 
approach whereby, as mentioned above, at least a partial 
restriction of CBDC usage abroad would probably also be 
appropriate.Deutsche Bundesbank

counts is restricted to domestic banks for risk, 
supervisory or monetary policy reasons.
Options for interoperable 
central bank digital currency
The concrete design of interoperability within 
the framework of a multilateral approach could 
take several forms.37 The appropriate concepts 
can be roughly divided into three categories, 
although the distinction between them is not 
always clearly delineated:38
– compatible CBDC systems;
– interlinked CBDC systems;
– a single CBDC system.
Compatible systems
The first option comprises CBDC systems that 
operate independently but are compatible. 
Interoperability is limited to compliance with 
common technical standards and, where ne -
cessary, harmonised legislation.39 Common 
technical standards, such as those relating to 
message formats, cryptographic techniques 
and user interfaces, can reduce the operational 
burden on those involved.40 Harmonised rules 
and standards simplify, for example, know your 
customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring 
processes. In principle, this applies both to 
CBDC and to private sector providers’ means 
and methods of payment.
Despite these advantages, in practice there are 
major obstacles to overcome before systems 
are compatible, although these are probably 
smaller than those described below. This is be -
cause common standards can only be drawn 
up in joint coordination processes which, in 
turn, produce coordination costs. In addition, 
implementing common, uniform message 
standards can take years, as the example of ISO 
20022 has shown. In 2004, the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) already 
published the 20022 standard for financial messages with the aim of harmonising cross-  
border payments and improving communica -
tion between stakeholders. In 2025 – 21 years 
later – it is due to be used across the board as 
a universal standard, at least in large- value pay -
ment systems.41 At the same time, work on the 
G20 roadmap mentioned at the beginning of 
this article is aiming to harmonise the applica -
tion of ISO 20022. Simply having a common 
standard does not necessarily mean that it is in -
terpreted in the same way globally.
Yet at the same time this option still requires re -
course to correspondent banking or alternative 
mechanisms in order to transfer a payment 
from one system to another.
Interlinked systems
The second option is to link various CBDC sys -
tems. This would enable a participant to make 
a payment from one CBDC system directly to a 
participant in another CBDC system without 
having to participate in the other CBDC system 
themselves. Such a set- up requires common 
technical interfaces and standards that enable 
information to be exchanged and thus pay -
ments to be made across different systems.
In addition, settlement could be simplified by 
using a central clearing agent to transfer pay -
ments to the other system or a common clear -
ing mechanism. Such a clearing mechanism Compatible sys -
tems limit inter -
operability to 
compliance with 
common tech -
nical standards 
and harmonised 
legislationSystems can be 
linked using 
interfaces and 
common clear -
ing mechanisms
37 Interoperability can and should, in principle, also be es -
tablished with systems other than those for CBDC. How -
ever, this article focuses solely on cross- border cooperation 
between CBDC systems.
38 See Bank for International Settlements (2021a).
39 Central banks in six countries (Canada, Japan, Sweden, 
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States), 
the ECB and the BIS have already begun to collaborate on 
fundamental questions regarding the design of CBDC; see 
BIS (2020). In future, initiatives such as these could form 
the basis of a cooperative approach or further- reaching 
joint activities.
40 In order to settle transactions, it may be necessary for 
at least one agent to participate in both systems as a liquid -
ity provider.
41 As part of the TARGET2/ T2S consolidation project, ISO 
20022- compliant messages will be used across all TARGET 
services from November 2022 onwards.Deutsche Bundesbank

could, for example, be designed in such a way 
that payments are booked via settlement ac -
counts with a central agent. It would, for in -
stance, keep accounts in different currencies 
for the participating central banks.42 The alter -
native would be a decentralised approach in 
which each participating central bank holds ac -
counts with all the other central banks. When 
currencies need to be exchanged, the central 
banks could either do this themselves or with 
the help of private sector intermediaries. This 
means that, if necessary, the central bank from 
whose currency area a payment request in 
CBDC is made would exchange the corres -
ponding amount on the foreign exchange mar -
ket and ultimately have it credited to the cen -
tral bank in whose currency area the payee is 
located. The amount would then be credited to 
their account in local-  currency CBDC.
The introduction of common mechanisms, 
such as technical interfaces, faces hurdles simi -
lar to those to agreement on uniform stand -ards in the first option. It should also be borne 
in mind that the direct technical linking of the 
systems would require a much higher degree of 
detail within the necessary agreements.
Interlinked systems are being tested, for ex -
ample, as part of the “Jasper-  Ubin”43 and 
“Jura”44 projects, which look at the cross-  
border use of wholesale CBDC. Both projects 
show how transactions on interface-  linked DLT 
systems can be synchronised over time to re -
duce, for instance, the risks –  and thus the 
costs – of cross-  border transactions involving 
multiple currencies. The Jura project success -

based security against wholesale CBDC in euro 
(delivery- versus- payment), followed by an ex -
change of the euro against wholesale CBDC in 
Swiss francs (payment- versus- payment). Tech -
nically, the security and the respective CBDC 
are issued on sub- systems, which in turn are 
linked via a common platform, with central 
banks retaining control over the issuance of 
their respective CBDC and the authorisation to 
participate in their sub- system.
Single system
The third option is based on the idea of a sin -
gle CBDC system as a multilateral platform. As 
a general rule, it is not necessary to ensure 
compatibility or to link different CBDC systems. 
Instead, the concept provides for a single rule -
book, a single technical system and a single set 
of participation criteria. Operators could be 
international institutions, a consortium of cen -
tral banks, or a public- private partnership of 
central banks and the private sector. Given that 
the use of CBDC is to be seen as an integral 
component of this, platforms that are operated 
solely privately are unlikely to be an option.
Such a platform could have a single settlement 
currency or be capable of processing multiple 
currencies. If in the first case the single settle -
ment currency were a national currency, such a 
system would have the properties of a unilat -
eral approach. This system would thus also 
share the macroeconomic problems of unilat -
eral approaches described above. If, on the 
other hand, a supranational settlement cur -
rency of its own were envisaged, fundamental 
questions would arise, such as what amount of 
such a currency would be issued and according 
to which rules. For these reasons, the current 
deliberations are focusing instead on multi-  
currency platforms. One advantage of using 
DLT could be that it would have a single tech -
nical platform with a single rulebook, yet still 
include decentralised elements, if necessary, 
and could provide some independent oper -
ational scope for the parties involved. Like in the Jura project, sub- networks could exist, but 
they would be more strongly integrated than 
systems linked via the common platform. Even 
in the case of multi- currency platforms, it 
would still be necessary to find a way for cur -
rency to be exchanged in cross- border transac -
tions. One of several options is the automated 
market- maker using wholesale CBDC described 
in the box on p. 71.
Single systems are likely to offer their users 
greater operational functionality and efficiency 
than the options described above. Owing to 
the high degree of integration, a large number 
of the advantages of using CBDC in cross-  
border payments as described above could be 
achieved as no cross- system communication 
would be necessary for the individual transac -
tions. At the same time, however, this increases 
the initial investment and the coordination 
costs between the parties involved in order to 
set up the system and to establish the require -
ments for common governance. The mBridge45 
and Dunbar46 projects are practical examples of 
conceptual studies for single systems, i.e. multi- 
currency DLT platforms based on wholesale 
CBDC. The innovative settlement of cross-  
border and cross- currency transactions aims to 
reduce transaction costs, settlement times and 
operational complexity.
Hybrid systems
It is not always possible to distinguish clearly 
between the individual options, however. Hy -
brid approaches combining elements of the 
various options are therefore also conceivable 
in principle. For example, a single system could Single CBDC sys -

Automated market- makers
Apart from involving central banks or pri-
vate intermediaries, currencies could, in 
principle, also be exchanged via automated 
market- makers (AMMs) on a common sys-
tem for central bank digital currency (CBDC) 
based on distributed ledger technology.1 
AMMs could be integrated into the soft-
ware protocol of such a system and auto-
matically process currency exchange.
This involves banks provisioning an omnibus 
account with liquidity in the form of CBDC, 
which, in turn, can be withdrawn by other 
participants in exchange for other CBDC. 
This would mean liquidity would be cen-
trally available to all participants, which 
could lead to a particularly good liquidity al-
location within the system, without partici-
pants being dependent on intermediaries.2 
AMMs are already used as part of decen-
tralised trading platforms in the decentral-
ised fi  nance sector. Nevertheless, practical 
problems may arise. One key challenge is in 
designing an appropriate incentive system 
that encourages banks to provide liquidity. 
On the one hand, banks would receive 
“liquidity tokens” for the funds that they 
have contributed, via which, in turn, the 
fees accrued for trades are distributed – as 
compensation and an incentive to provide 
liquidity. On the other hand, liquidity pro-
viders also bear the risk of price changes 
when it comes to re- exchanging the liquid-
ity tokens for the funds that they have con-
tributed. This is because trading transac-
tions add an asset (e.g. a currency) to the 
omnibus account, while the respective 
other asset is withdrawn from it at the same 
time. The transaction therefore shifts the 
volume ratio of the tokens in the omnibus 
account. On the basis of an algorithm, 
these changes lead to opposing price 
changes. The price of the added asset de-creases and the price of the withdrawn 
asset increases, whereby the user who car-
ried out the exchange loses out (slippage 
loss). Prices therefore do not necessarily re-
fl  ect supply and demand in the market, but 
rather encourage users to carry out oppos-
ing arbitrage transactions in order to restore 
the original volume ratio. The greater the 
shift an exchange transaction produces in 
the value ratio of a trading pair, the greater 
the slippage loss. It is therefore important 
that the omnibus account is suffi   ciently 
large, especially for less- traded currencies.3 
The incentive problem described above is 
one of the obstacles that would have to be 
removed before AMMs could potentially be 
used in a CBDC system.

be used within a region, which, in turn, is 
linked bilaterally to CBDC infrastructures in 
other countries. In practice, such hybrid sys -
tems could play a greater role in the future, es -
pecially because diverging national interests 
may make global agreement on a single ap -
proach appear unrealistic and possibly not even 
be desirable. It is more likely that various ap -
proaches will be implemented in a region, 
which could in turn be interlinked.
Examples of this can also be seen in some cur -
rent projects. For example, the Jura project de -
scribed above (interlinked systems) also con -
tains elements of a common platform, which, 
in turn, is more consistent with the third option 
(single systems).
By contrast, although the mBridge project is 
based on a common platform, it also includes 
the possibility of linking this platform to other 
CBDC systems or other platforms. This, too, en -
tails switching between interlinked and single 
systems. Future interoperability models may in -
clude different elements of each option in 
order to meet the needs of each currency area.
Potential and challenges for 
the cross- border use of 
central  bank digital currency
Compared with the current correspondent 
banking system, all three options promise sig -
nificant improvements. In theory, interlinking 
CBDC systems may lead to faster, cheaper and 
more transparent cross- border payments. De -
pending on the design of the respective CBDC, 
this could also give additional user groups 
within the general public access to cross- border 
payments. At the same time, the degree of im -
provement depends on the version of the 
multilateral cooperation model that is chosen. 
The overview on p. 73 summarises the poten -
tial that each of the options for interoperable 
CBDC offer compared with the current corres -
pondent banking system.The degree of interoperability and potential ef -
ficiency gains will increase, whether in compat -
ible, interlinked or single systems. However, as 
the degree of interoperability rises, so too will 
the complexity of the systems and thus the dif -
ficulty of implementing them. This will hold 
even if the new CBDC systems are only de -
signed as compatible systems (as in the first op -
tion). It would need to be clarified, for ex -
ample, which standards (e.g. messaging stand -
ards or standards for the transmission of data 
for anti- money laundering purposes) in pay -
ment processing are to be migrated from the 
existing systems and which ones are to be 
abandoned in favour of new, internationally 
compatible standards. The introduction and 
implementation of these international stand -
ards could pose major challenges for system 
users and would entail considerable costs. In 
addition, divergent national interests or differ -
ent perspectives may hinder closer international 
cooperation and significantly delay work on the 
common standards or even bring it to a halt.
To a certain extent, the in- depth international 
cooperation required for the interlinked and 
single systems is associated with ceding auton -
omy in favour of common governance struc -
tures, which represents an additional obstacle 
to linking payment systems.47 This hurdle can 
be circumvented or at least mitigated by factor -
ing at an early stage the cross-  border use of 
CBDC systems into the development of new 
CBDC systems, before their development be -
comes too divergent in different jurisdictions.
Another obstacle could be the relatively high 
investment costs for new systems, which might 
be incurred in addition to the ongoing costs of 
the current systems. However, elements of 
existing systems could also be reused, possibly 
after modification. In this respect, too, it is 
probably advisable to incorporate the thinking 
behind the development and operation of a 
common platform into a country’s own project 
activities at an early stage, as it would become All options

more unlikely to achieve such a platform once 
national CBDC systems have already been intro -
duced across the board.
Moreover, differences in legislation will be a 
major impediment to the cross- border inter -
operability of new payment systems. There are 
differences between countries not only in terms 
of anti- money laundering and combating the 
financing of terrorism (AML/ CFT), but also re -
garding the rules governing risk management, 
cyber security and the handling of personal 
data. International harmonisation of legal 
frameworks could have a significant impact on 
national legal systems that is politically either 
difficult or impossible to deliver and which is 
also not offset by the prospect of more effi -
cient cross- border payments.
Another critical factor when setting up inter -
operable infrastructures is the close intercon -
nectedness between systems in different eco -
nomic areas. Facilitated by tight integration be -tween system users, for example, the effects of 
localised crises in individual economic seg -
ments or of participant defaults could spread 
globally (spillover effects). Faster transaction 
processing due to closer links or integration is 
also associated with higher operational risk. As 
a general rule, the decision regarding the de -
sired degree of interoperability therefore al -
ways requires a detailed risk analysis.
Last but not least, greater cooperation always 
involves an increase in dependencies, which 
may also have political implications. For ex -
ample, when using a single system, clear and 
binding rules for contingency procedures are 
required, which may lead to the mandatory ex -
clusion of participants from the system in an 
emergency. Potential conflict could also arise 
when implementing financial sanctions of vari -
ous types if they are assessed and implemented 
differently by the cooperating countries.Different legal

Outlook and conclusion
The work initiated by the G20 countries aims to 
significantly improve the efficiency of cross-  
border payments, which would require consid -
erable efforts in a relatively short period of 
time. The corresponding measures should ad -
dress as many of the weaknesses identified by 
the G20 countries as possible. In particular, 
purely technical approaches will not have a 
lasting impact unless they are accompanied at 
the same time by a globally consistent imple -
mentation of the relevant legal regulations and 
an improvement in the exchange of informa -
tion.
The specific objectives that have been formu -
lated so far are supposed to be achieved by 
2027. If this timetable is kept, CBDC is unlikely 
to make any material contribution, as most 
CBDC projects are at a very early stage and will 
not be able to unfold much of their potential in 
cross- border payments during this period. In 
this respect, it will also be necessary to place a 
high priority on exploring other private sector 
approaches, such as the linking of real- time re -
tail payment systems. In recent years, many 
countries have invested in setting up such pay -
ment systems, often based on international 
standards. In countries with strong political and 
economic integration, the use of common 
technical infrastructures for the settlement of 
cross- currency payments in real time could also 
be considered outside of CBDC. Such an ap -
proach is currently being investigated by the 
Eurosystem in its efforts to improve TARGET In -
stant Payment Settlement.48
Nevertheless, CBDC will offer the opportunity 
to increase the speed of settlement of cross-  
border payments in the medium term, to re -
duce transaction costs and to intensify compe -
tition in international payments. CBDC systems 
will be designed to provide easy access to 
CBDC and are likely to increase financial inclu -
sion in many countries, thereby broadening the 
scope for participation in payment transac -
tions. CBDCs could also unfold their potential in cross-  border payments in conjunction with 
other technologies. For example, linked eID 
ecosystems could reduce frictions with regard 
to compliance with financial sanctions as well 
as AML/CFT measures.
A multilateral approach thus offers the best 
chance for CBDC to help comprehensively re -
duce the frictions currently constraining cross-  
border payments. Various central banks would 
collaborate in this endeavour: they would issue 
CBDC, which would held primarily in their own 
currency area but would allow cross- border 
payments through interoperability with other 
CBDC systems. This seems more advantageous 
than the option of individual central banks 
making their CBDC usable for cross- border pay -
ments unilaterally. Moreover, such an approach 
would not resolve existing frictions across na -
tional borders. If central banks were to even 
design their own CBDC in such a way that large 
amounts of it could be held abroad, this would 
harbour a number of economic risks – not least 
for themselves. And ultimately, such an ap -
proach could be seen as an attempt to create 
monetary policy or technological dependen -
cies.
By contrast, were individual central banks to 
cooperate with each other, the question arises 
as to how CBDCs should be made interoper -
able. Any efficiency gains from a higher degree 
of integration generally come with higher co -
ordination costs. Moreover, a growing degree 
of integration always implies the ceding of sov -
ereignty, which means that efficiency gains 
must be weighed against other policy object -
ives. For example, a single, common worldwide 
CBDC platform involving a large number of cur -
rency areas from the outset is difficult to im -
agine at this juncture.
However, the combination of various, possibly 
hybrid approaches could be a more viable op -
tion. A high degree of interoperability is likely 
to be achievable among currency areas that are CBDC will likely 
come too late to 
make a signifi -

closely linked economically and politically, 
where the willingness to coordinate and com -
promise is comparatively high and the potential 
for conflict is limited. Regionally highly inte -
grated systems of this kind could then be made 
compatible with one another or be interlinked. Ultimately, this would cover a large number of 
currency areas without having to enter into a 
multitude of bilateral cooperation agreements. 
That said, it remains crucial that interoperability 
has to be taken into account from the outset 
when designing CBDC.A combination 
of hybrid

Government debt in the euro area: 
developments in creditor structure
Euro area government debt amounted to 96% of gross domestic product (GDP) at last count. This 
article describes how creditor structure has evolved in recent years. The focus is on the euro area 
as a whole and on the four largest Member States, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
Creditor structure has shifted significantly since 2015 as a result of the Eurosystem’s asset pur -
chases. By the end of 2021, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks had 
bought government debt in a magnitude of 30% of euro area GDP. Meanwhile, the volume of 
debt held by other creditors fell. In relation to GDP it was consequently also lower than before 
the financial and economic crisis. Indebtedness to euro area banks and non- euro area creditors, 
in particular, has been on the decline since then.
In the large Member States, the respective national central banks, especially, acquired govern -
ment bonds. As in the euro area as a whole, this was accompanied by a simultaneous decline in 
the weight of domestic banks and foreign creditors. Overall, government interest payments 
(including any risk premia) largely flow to domestic recipients, with a good portion going to the 
national central banks. Profit distributions by central banks mean that interest payments ultim -
ately flow back to the government. De facto, the government thus pays the short- term, risk- free 
deposit rate for these bonds rather than the bond rate. This channel renders public finances more 
sensitive to changes in central bank interest rates. Meanwhile, the remaining bonds are less sen -
sitive to interest rates because the residual maturities of government bonds have lengthened in 
recent years.
Commercial banks are the second- largest creditor sector in the euro area after central banks. 
Their weight as creditors has developed differently in the individual Member States. Compared 
with the period before the financial and economic crisis, banks in Germany currently hold less 
national government debt (securities and loans, as a percentage of GDP). In France, holdings 
were stable, overall, during this period. In Spain and Italy, meanwhile, they increased significantly 
on balance. A similar development is seen for the ratio of home- country government debt held 
by banks as a percentage of national banking systems’ own funds. The nexus between national 
banking systems and their home country harbours risks to financial stability. Reducing these risks 
seems particularly important if risk sharing in the European banking union is to be stepped up. 
Reducing the regulatory privileges that government debt enjoys on bank balance sheets would 
reduce these risks. This proposal has, however, found no political majority to date.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
This article focuses on the creditor structure of 
euro area government debt. A brief outline will 
also be given of the structure of debt instru -
ments. The euro area is analysed as a whole 
and, by way of example, the four largest euro 
area countries – Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain. Among the creditor groups, the Eurosys -
tem (the ECB and the national central banks) 
and the national banking systems especially are 
looked at in greater detail. These groups have 
played a key role in shaping developments in 
recent years.
Different data sources are used in the various 
sections of the article. In some cases, their def -
initions differ, and the data are also obtained 
from different sources. The data sources, their 
statistical definition and the associated ambigu -
ities are explained on pp. 82 and 83. The main 
data base used for creditor structure has been 
available since the middle of the last decade.
Government debt: size, 
instruments  and residual 
maturity 
At the end of 2021, the total government debt 
of all euro area countries amounted to 96% of 
the euro area’s GDP . From a starting point of 
70% at the end of 2008, the debt ratio had 
risen sharply during the financial and sovereign 
debt crisis. After declining moderately until 
2019, the ratio jumped back up during the 
coronavirus pandemic. It reached 97% at the 
end of 2020, its highest level since the start of 
monetary union (see the upper chart on p. 79).1
Debt instruments predominantly constitute me -
dium to long- term liabilities. They have become 
even more significant over time:2 the percent -
age of liabilities with a maturity of more than 
one year in total debt rose from 85% at the 
end of 2008 to almost 90% at the end of 2021. 
The list is topped by debt securities (especially 
bonds), which are generally marketable. They have significantly greater weight than loans, 
which banks, in particular, issue to govern -
ments. State liabilities from currency and de -
posits represent only a small share of govern -
ment debt, at around 3%. These are liabilities 
related to government coin issuance or de -
posits made with the government.
The individual Member States’ debt ratios vary 
widely (see the lower chart on p. 79). Figures 
range from 18% in Estonia to 193% in Greece. 
The structure is mostly dominated by long- term 
debt in the form of securities. The main excep -
tions are those countries that still have signifi -
cant levels of long- term assistance loans 
(Greece, Portugal and Cyprus).3 The assistance 
loans were granted in connection with the sov -
ereign debt crisis.
The average residual maturity of government 
securities debt has increased in recent years 
(see the chart on p. 80 for the four large Mem -
ber States). Changes in interest rates therefore 
have a smaller impact on government finances, 
as interest payments are, for the most part, 
fixed for longer periods.4 After the onset of the 
financial and economic crisis, residual matur -
ities had mostly fallen markedly.Focus on cred -

1 In addition, the EU level took out debt for the Support to 
mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) pro -
gramme and the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme. 
The EU Member States ultimately shoulder the interest and 
principal payments for this debt. Where these funds are 
used to finance grants to the EU Member States, they are 
not included in national debt levels. For example, grants to -
talling €390 billion (in 2018 prices) are planned under the 
NGEU programme. This is equivalent to roughly 3% of the 
EU’s GDP in 2021. For more detailed information, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2020, 2022a).
2 Classification into short- term and long- term liabilities ac -
cording to Eurostat’s Government Finance Statistics: short- 
term liabilities with original maturities of up to one year, 
long- term liabilities with original maturities of more than 
one year or without details on maturity.
3 Greece was also issued with bilateral assistance loans by 
the other euro area Member States (Greek Loan Facility). In 
addition, the Member States most affected by the sover -
eign debt crisis received financial assistance from the Euro -
pean Commission (under the European Financial Stabilisa -
tion Mechanism, EFSM) and the International Monetary 
Fund.
4 In individual cases, variable interest rates may also have 
been agreed for long maturities. On the other hand, debt -
ors can also use derivatives to secure fixed interest rates be -
yond the residual maturity.Deutsche Bundesbank

Government debt: 
structure of creditors5
A look at the euro area 
as a whole
In the middle of the last decade, almost one-  
third of euro area countries’ government debt 
was held outside of the euro area (see the 
chart on p. 81). Looking at the domestic euro 
area sectors, monetary financial institutions 
dominated (hereinafter referred to as “banks”, 
excluding central banks). They also held almost 
one- third of total debt. They were followed by 
insurance corporations and pension funds 
(13%) as well as other financial institutions 
such as investment funds (9%). Looking at the 
euro area as a whole, households, international 
institutions, the Eurosystem and non- financial 
corporations played only a minor role as credit -
ors.
Creditor structure has shifted considerably 
since then, mainly as a result of the Eurosys -
tem’s large- scale government bond purchases.6 
At the end of 2021, the Eurosystem’s holdings 
of government bonds issued by Member States 
amounted to around €3.6 trillion, or 30% of 
euro area GDP .7 The Eurosystem’s holdings 
were therefore significantly larger than the in -
crease in Member States’ debt since the end of 
2014, which amounted to €2.3 trillion.8 Since In the middle of 
the last decade, 
euro area banks 
and foreign 
creditors 
represented  the 
largest  creditor 
groups

6 The Eurosystem purchased public sector bonds on a large 
scale through the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) 
from March 2015 and the pandemic emergency purchase 
programme (PEPP) from March 2020. National central 
banks predominantly acquired bonds issued by their own 
Member State. The ECB bought around 10% of the pur -
chase volume. Purchases by the national central banks are 
not subject to risk sharing, and the national central bank 
receives the interest income. The ECB purchases are subject 
to risk sharing. For information on the rationale behind and 
the design of the various programmes, see the Official 
Journal of the European Union L 39 (2020a) and the Offi -
cial Journal of the European Union L 91 (2020b).
7 This does not include bonds purchased by supranational 
institutions. Including these “supras”, holdings total around 
€4 trillion or 33% of euro area GDP . Holdings of govern -
ment bonds that the Eurosystem central banks acquired in 
line with the Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) are 
likewise not included.

the onset of the financial and economic crisis, 
Eurosystem holdings account for around three- 
quarters of the rise in debt (+€5.0 trillion since 
the end of 2008). As a percentage of GDP , debt 
not held by the Eurosystem is lower than be -
fore the financial and economic crisis.
The Eurosystem was thus by far the largest 
creditor sector at the end of 2021 (see the 
upper chart on p. 81). For almost all other sec -
tors, the holdings of government debt fell in 
absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP as 
compared with the end of 2014. Insurance cor -
porations and pension funds are the only ex -
ception. The decline in debt to foreign creditors 
(non- euro area) was particularly significant, fol -
lowed by banks and other financial institutions 
within the euro area.
A closer look at Germany, 
France, Italy and Spain
A more detailed description of developments in 
the four large Member States Germany, France, 
Italy and Spain is given below. Developments in 
their government debt ratios and creditor struc -
tures have diverged. They also differed signifi -
cantly at the end of 2021.The debt ratios in the four countries rose con -
siderably from different levels following the 
onset of the financial and economic crisis (see 
the lower chart on p.  81). By the time the 
coronavirus pandemic broke out in 2020, Ger -
many’s debt ratio was well below its level of 
end- 2008 again. During the same period, the 
debt ratio in France continued to rise moder -
ately, whereas it stagnated at the higher level 
in Spain and Italy. During the coronavirus pan -
demic in 2020 and 2021, all countries experi -
enced a renewed sharp rise in their debt ratios. 
The German debt ratio was only 4 percentage 
points higher at the end of 2021 than at the 
end of 2008. In France, it had risen by 44 per -
centage points, in Italy by 45 percentage points 
and in Spain it was 79 percentage points higher 
(starting from a moderate level).
The table on p. 85 contains detailed informa -
tion on the creditor structure of the four coun -
tries. It shows the holdings of the creditor 
groups both in relation to total debt and in re -
lation to national GDP . In Germany and France, 
foreign creditors (in this case, creditors from 
outside the respective Member State excluding 
the Eurosystem central banks) held just under 
60% of government debt in 2014. Domestic 
banks were the second- largest creditor group 
in Germany, holding around one- quarter of 
government debt, while the figure for France 
was around one- fifth. In Italy, meanwhile, ex -
ternal debt stood at just over one- third and in 
Spain at just under 40% of government debt. 
At close to one- third, debt to domestic banks 
was only moderately lower in these countries.
In 2015, the large- scale asset purchases by the 
Eurosystem central banks started and altered 
creditor structures considerably (see the table 
on p. 85, chart on p. 84). At the end of 2021, 
asset holdings under the purchase programmes 
amounted to 39% in Germany, 27% in France, 
25% in Italy and 32% in Spain, as a percentage 
of the respective government debt. In Germany 
and France, meanwhile, the shares held by for -
eign creditors (excluding the ECB, which is in -

tion), in particular, fell. They previously held an 
especially large percentage. In Italy, the shares 
of all other creditor groups fell relatively 
broadly. In Spain, the percentage held by do -
mestic banks, in particular, dropped.
The macroeconomic relevance can be seen in 
holdings relative to national GDP . At the end of 
2021, the Eurosystem’s (Bundesbank’s and 
ECB’s) holdings of German government debt 
acquired for monetary policy purposes 
amounted to 27% of (German) GDP . The 
equivalent figure for France was 31%, while it 
was 38% for both Italy and Spain.9 Everywhere 
except for France, the holdings accumulated by the Eurosystem exceeded the increase in debt 
over the same period.10 For the pandemic years 
2020 and 2021, the build- up of Eurosystem 
holdings in the four Member States was roughly 
in line with the increase in debt.11
The creditor structure can be used to deter -
mine the extent to which government interest 
expenditure remains within a country or goes 
beyond its borders. This also applies to the risk 
premia that this expenditure contains. Debt 
held by foreign creditors as a percentage of 
GDP gives some indication of the flow of inter -Eurosystem

percentage of 
the respective 
GDP) range

The figures diverge because the purchases under the PSPP 
and PEPP are based on the Eurosystem’s capital key. This is 
made up of the respective share of a Member State in the 
total population (currently for 2018) and euro area GDP 
(currently the average for 2013-17), whereby both have 
equal weighting. In 2021, the ratio of capital key to GDP 
share was 90% for Germany, 102% for France, 119% for 
Italy and 120% for Spain.
10 At the end of 2021, Germany’s holdings of government 
bonds amounted to around €970 billion, whereas its debt 
level rose by €270 billion between 2014 and 2021. For 
France, the figures are around €760 billion and €770 billion 
respectively, for Italy around €670 billion and €470 billion 
respectively, and for Spain around €460 billion and €340 
billion respectively.

Information on the data and their statistical defi  nition
Various data sources were combined in this 
article so as to provide the most compre-
hensive picture possible. The data are not 
fully compatible in some cases, nor are they 
uniformly defi  ned, leading to ambiguities in 
some places. However, this is unlikely to 
have a signifi  cant impact on the fundamen-
tal developments presented. The last date 
for which the data used are jointly available 
is the end of 2021.
Data on the volume and instrument struc-
ture of government debt are taken from 
Euro stat’s Government Finance Statistics 
(GFS). This is general government debt (ac-
cording to the national accounts) at nom-
inal values, which is also referred to as the 
Maastricht debt level.1
Data on the creditor structure of securities 
are taken mainly from the Securities Hold-
ings Statistics (SHS) and the Securities Hold-
ings Statistics by Sector (SHSS) of the Euro-
pean Central Bank (ECB). These comprise 
the bond holdings of the aggregate sectors 
for the euro area as a whole and for individ-
ual Member States, excluding central banks 
in each case. Consistent data are available 
for these from the fourth quarter of 2013. 
All fi  gures are nominal.
These securities data are supplemented by 
data on the creditor structure of banks’ 
credit claims (nominal values), taken from 
the ECB’s balance sheet statistics. No separ-
ate information on holders is available for 
credit claims on general government not 
held by banks or government liabilities from 
currency and deposits (6% and 1%, respect-
ively, of total debt in the euro area). These 
categories are reported under “Other”.
These data are supplemented by data from 
the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) on 
the outstanding fi  nancial assistance pro-
vided under the European Financial Stability 
facility (EFSF) and the ESM (nominal values).Data on the government bonds of Member 
States held by the Eurosystem are taken 
from publications by the ECB and the na-
tional central banks. The holdings reported 
include all purchases of public sector bonds 
issued by Member States under the monet-
ary policy asset purchase programmes (pur-
chases of bonds issued by supranational in-
stitutions are not taken into account in this 
article). However, in addition to govern-
ment bonds issued by Member States, the 
Eurosystem also purchases bonds issued by 
national development banks and other na-
tional public undertakings. The latter are 
not usually included in national government 
debt. In this respect, the Eurosystem’s ac-
tual holdings of government debt (as de-
fi  ned by the GFS) are likely to be lower than 
reported here (this is probably the case for 
Germany, at least).
Moreover, the holdings of the Eurosystem 
are measured differently to the other fi  g-
ures reported in this article. For example, 
only holdings under the Securities Markets 
Programme are published at nominal val-
ues. By contrast, holdings under the signifi  -
cantly larger purchase programmes from 
2015 onwards are reported according to 
balance sheet data. Wherever the Eurosys-
tem has purchased securities at prices 
above the nominal value, its share is thus 
overstated (this is likely to have been the 
case in most instances).
However, the share of Eurosystem central 
banks as creditors of government bonds is 
underreported in a different context. Specif-
ically, the Eurosystem’s reported shares do 
not include government bonds purchased 
by national central banks for their own 
portfolios outside the monetary policy asset 
purchase programmes (based on the Agree-
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2022

est to other countries. To examine this aspect, 
the analysis of Eurosystem bond holdings con -
ducted so far has to be expanded to include a 
distinction between domestic and foreign hold -
ings. From a national perspective, the ECB’s 
holdings are held largely by foreign creditors. 
This is because they are subject to risk sharing 
and, therefore, the bulk of the interest paid on 
the ECB’s holdings goes to other countries.12 By 
contrast, all interest payments on national cen -
tral banks’ holdings remain within their re -
spective home countries. Defined in this way, 
debt held by foreign creditors in Germany 
amounted to 23% of German GDP . The equiva -
lent figure for France was 49%, 43% for Italy 
and 44% for Spain.
At present, a large share of the interest ex -
penditure remaining inside respective euro area 
countries is being channelled to their national 
central banks, mainly owing to the national 
central banks’ holdings of bonds issued by their 
home countries. In addition, there are the hold -ings of bonds issued by the home countries 
and purchased by the Eurosystem with risk 
sharing (see the table on p. 86). This is because 
the interest paid on these bonds is distributed 
to all national central banks in line with the 
capital key. At the end of 2021, holdings calcu -
lated in this manner as a percentage of na -
tional GDP stood at 25% (Bundesbank hold -
ings) for Germany, 28% for France, 34% for 
National central 
banks have size -
able claims on 
home countriesment on Net Financial Assets (ANFA)).2 Data 
on the holdings of domestic government 
bonds that these contain are not pub-
lished.
Government bonds held abroad are not 
explicitly  recorded in the creditor structure 
statistics, which are the main source used 
here. This is because securities depositories 
from non- euro area countries are not sub-
ject to reporting requirements. For this rea-
son, the category of government debt held 
abroad was calculated and reported as a re-
sidual fi  gure in this article. This is the result 
of the difference between the outstanding 
national debt securities according to the 
GFS and the sum of the holdings reported 
in the SHS and SHSS holdings statistics as 
well as the holdings of the Eurosystem 
(again, excluding supranational bonds).3 
The aforementioned ambiguities stemming 
from the different statistical defi  nitions of 
the data (in particular with regard to the 
Euro system’s holdings) affect this residual.In this respect, Germany’s external debt, for 
example, is likely to be underestimated 
whilst Italy’s is overestimated. There is one 
further aspect to bear in mind when inter-
preting and differentiating between the do-
mestic country and foreign countries. Al-
though the reported statistics distinguish 
domestic holdings of government bonds 
from holdings abroad, this does not neces-
sarily mean they are held by domestic or 
foreign creditors in each case. Foreign cred-
itors can also hold government bonds in 
domestic safe custody accounts, and vice 
versa.

tral banks are allowed to invest beyond monetary pol-

States that were hit especially hard by the fi  nancial and 
debt crisis, euro area countries jointly borrowed 
through the EFSF. In the fi  gures reported for individual 
Member States in this article, this share was allocated 
to external debt.
12 The Eurosystem agreed on full risk sharing for purchases 
under the Securities Markets Programme (SMP). For pur -
chases under the PSPP and PEPP , it agreed that 20% of pur -
chases would be subject to risk sharing. These are the 
ECB’s purchases of government bonds and bonds issued by 
development banks and other public undertakings, as well 
as purchases by the national central banks of bonds issued 
by supranational institutions (10% in each instance). Inter -
est income on holdings subject to risk sharing is distributed 
between the national central banks in accordance with the 
Eurosystem’s capital key. 80% of purchases under the PSPP 
and PEPP are excluded from risk sharing. These are pur -
chases by the national central banks of securities issued by 
regional and local governments, development banks and 
other public undertakings within the national central 
banks’ jurisdiction.Deutsche Bundesbank

Italy and 35% for Spain.13 In addition, the Euro -
system central banks can (under ANFA) hold 
government bonds in portfolios for non-  
monetary policy purposes. The Bundesbank 
does not make use of this option. The relevant 
ANFA balance sheet items of the Banque de 
France total around 2% of national GDP , while 
those for the Banca d’Italia amount to 7% and 
those for the Banco de España 2%.14 The share 
of government bonds issued by national cen -
tral banks’ home countries within these aggre -
gate items is not published, but is likely to be 
substantial in some cases.

13 For these figures, bonds purchased by the Eurosystem 
with risk sharing were allocated to the respective Member 
States according to the capital key. These are SMP holdings 
and the ECB’s country- specific purchases under the PSPP 
and the PEPP , each excluding holdings of bonds issued by 
supranational institutions. In addition, central banks also 
receive income from holdings of non- domestic securities 
and bonds issued by supranational institutions for pur -
chases of which risk sharing has been agreed. As a percent -
age of national GDP , the Eurosystem’s holdings of this na -
ture amounted to around 5% for the Bundesbank, 6% for 
the Banque de France and 7% for the Banca d’Italia and 
the Banco de España.
14 The data were taken from the balance sheets of the na -
tional central banks for the 2021 financial year. These fig -
ures concern all relevant euro- denominated investments, 
not just national government bonds. The table on p. 86 
shows, in particular, balance sheet items 7.2. (Other secur -
ities not held for monetary policy purposes) and 11.3 
(Other financial assets). Relevant supplementary informa -
tion in the annual reports has been taken into account. See 
Banca d’Italia (2022), Banco de España (2022), Banque de 
France (2022) and Deutsche Bundesbank (2022b). The 
Bundesbank has no holdings in this context. The Banque 
de France has holdings of €43.4 billion and the Banco de 
España holdings of €28.8 billion. In its annual report on 
other investment in euro area government bonds, the 
Banca d’Italia reported a figure of €125.1 billion.

rate at the monetary policy (risk- free) rate. This 
is due to the fact that interest payments on the 
purchased government bonds go to the na -
tional central banks. As bond purchases grew, 
so did commercial banks’ deposits at central 
banks. In turn, the national central banks pay 
interest on these (now 0%, previously at a 
negative deposit facility rate). The difference 
between income from bond holdings and ex -
penditure on the deposit facility affects central 
bank profit. As soon as it is distributed, it has 
an impact on government finances.16 In this re -
spect, the balance sheet link between central 
banks and government finances means that 
interest rates on bonds (including risk premia) flow back to the Member States, which effect -
ively pay the short- term deposit rate.
In terms of interest rate risk to government 
finances, the described lengthening of the re -
sidual maturities for government debt should 
therefore be interpreted with caution. Where 
central banks engage in maturity transform -
ation via their balance sheets, this increases the 
sensitivity of government finances to short- term 
changes in central bank interest rates. This 
counterbalances the longer residual maturities.… and sensitiv -

The varying interest rates on holdings of gov -
ernment bonds issued by the home country are 
reflected in the national central banks’ balance 
sheets. Although other effects also play a role 
(including changes in provisions and reserves), 
this can be seen, for example, in last year’s an -
nual accounts of the national central banks of 
the four large Member States. While the Bun -
desbank did not distribute any profit to the 
government in 2022 (2021 financial year), 
transfers (including payments of profit- related 
taxes) amounted to 0.3% of GDP in France and 
Spain and to 0.8% of GDP in Italy in the same 
year.
Government debt held by 
the national banking sector
The domestic banking system is the second-  
largest creditor sector in the euro area after 
central banks. The banking system is of particu -
lar importance in terms of financial stability. The sovereign debt crisis showed that problems 
with government finances and in the banking 
system can quickly be mutually reinforcing and 
pose a threat to financial stability. For example, 
government solvency risks feed through vari -
ous transmission channels to affect the credit 
quality and funding options of banks. At the 
same time, distress in the banking system can 
trigger or exacerbate sovereign debt crises. In 
view of this, changes in national banking sec -
tors’ claims on their home countries are of par -
ticular interest.
A look at the euro area  
as a whole
At the end of 2021, the aggregate euro area 
banking sector (euro area monetary financial 
institutions excluding central banks) held claims 
on Member States amounting to 21% of GDP 
(see the chart on p.  87). These were mainly 
claims on the respective home country. These Bond purchases

play a crucial role in the national sovereign-  
bank nexus.
At the end of 2021, banks’ claims on their 
home countries were back at a level similar to 
the one recorded at the end of 2008 (17% of 
euro area GDP in each case; see the chart 
above).17 Over the course of the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis, banks had considerably 
expanded their holdings of these claims (par -
ticularly government bonds). However, they re -
duced them again when the Eurosystem 
launched its large- scale asset purchase pro -
grammes.
Looking at claims in relation to the own funds 
of domestic banks, the picture is similar. These 
funds are ultimately the buffer that banks can 
use to absorb any losses. Comparing claims on 
the home countries to the own funds of the 
domestic banking system, this figure has fallen 
slightly, from 90% prior to the financial and 
economic crisis to just under 80% (see the 
lower chart on p. 88).18
A closer look at Germany, 
France, Italy and Spain
In turn, developments in the four large Mem -
ber States were very different (see the upper chart on p. 88). Upon the outbreak of the finan -
cial and economic crisis, banks in all Member 
States increased their claims on their respective 
home countries. In Germany and France, these 
claims rose only slightly and remained roughly 
at the level then reached from 2011 onwards. 
By contrast, banks domiciled in Spain and Italy 
considerably expanded their claims on their 
home countries. Following the launch of the 
Eurosystem’s purchase programmes, banks’ 
claims on their home countries fell in all Mem -
ber States from 2015 onwards, especially in 
Spain. In Italy, this trend then reversed starting 
in early 2018 amid heightened uncertainty sur -
rounding the country’s elections and the for -
mation of a new government. In France and 
Spain, the banking sectors started expanding 
their holdings of national government bonds 
again when the coronavirus pandemic broke 
out. Compared with the situation prior to the 
financial and economic crisis, it was only in 
Germany that banks’ claims on the home coun -
try decreased – in relation to GDP , they went 
from just under 19% at the end of 2008 to 
11% at the end of 2021. At 16% of GDP , the Banks’ claims on

as capital and reserves according to the ECB’s balance 
sheet statistics. These values may differ from bank to bank. 
They are therefore only a rough, aggregate indicator.Deutsche Bundesbank

ratio in France was back on par with the one 
recorded at the end of 2008. In Spain, it went 
up from 14% to 23%, whilst in Italy, starting at 
24%, it reached a new peak of 38%.19
Looking at the claims on each home country in 
relation to the own funds of its domestic banks 
also reveals a mixed picture (see the chart 
above).20 While the ratio for Germany stood at 
126% at the end of 2008, it had fallen to 62% 
by the end of 2021. For France, this figure de -
creased from 77% to 56% over the same 
period. By contrast, these ratios increased in 
Spain and Italy. Following the outbreak of the financial and economic crisis, they rose from 
67% to 110% in Spain and in Italy from 147% 
to just under 200% at the end of the period 
under review.
Overall, it is clear that banks are intercon -
nected, sometimes closely, with their home 
country. Compared with the situation prior to 
the financial and economic crisis, the link is in 
some cases even stronger. Banks, therefore, 
have not all become more resilient to the fiscal 
risks of their home country. In this respect, 
financial stability risks remain. Further steps to -
wards broader risk redistribution within the 
framework of the banking union are currently 
under discussion. If this should fail to achieve a 
larger- scale redistribution of fiscal risks, it would 
be necessary to place a tight limit on the risks 
for banks arising from government bonds.21 Banking sectors

19 Deviations from the table on p. 85 arise from the valu -
ation approach used in the balance sheet statistics, which 
report bond holdings at book values. By contrast, they are 
reported at nominal values in the SHSS holdings statistics. 
Bonds accounted for 37% of domestic banks’ total claims 
on the home country for Germany, 46% for France, 61% 
for Italy and 71% for Spain.
20 The situation in which individual banks find themselves 
can vary considerably.
21 In addition, risks in banks’ balance sheets arising from 
legacy debt, such as the various losses arising from non-  
performing loans, would have to be sufficiently mitigated 
in advance. The current resolution regime for banks also 
needs to be reformed so that, wherever possible, no public 
funds will be used to bail out banks in future. For more de -
tails, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b).Deutsche Bundesbank

Reducing the regulatory privileges that govern -
ment debt enjoys on bank balance sheets would go some way to achieving this, but so 
far this has lacked a political majority.

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the

tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections as of 2020 Q1. Until 2019 Q4 these are compiled using Solvency I
supervisory data, supplemented by voluntary reports and own calculations.  1 Including
deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans
and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension funds on pension managers
and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical reserves "life" taking account oftransitional measures. Health insurance is also included in the "non-life insurance"
sector.  4 Own funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other
equity".  5 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by primary insurers, which
is included there.  6 Valuation at book values. The term "pension funds" refers to the
institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of Accounts. Pension funds
thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational pension schemes for the
self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  7 Change in data sources.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland,
Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were
used.  2 Includes countries belonging to the group EER-19 and additionally Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico,Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB suspends
the publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against
Russian rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation
of effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from
that date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of
Russia in conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to
the US dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 in-
cluding Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta,
from 2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia,
from 2015 including Lithuania) as well as Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  5 Euro area countries (current
composition) and countries belonging to the group EER-19.  6 Euro area countries (cur-
