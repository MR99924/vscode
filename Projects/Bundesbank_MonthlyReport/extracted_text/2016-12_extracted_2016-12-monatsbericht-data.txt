Outlook for the German economy –
macroeconomic projections for 2017 and
2018 and an outlook for 2019
Germany’s economy is on a sound upward path. The chief source of growth is buoyant domestic
demand, which is being propelled by the upbeat situation in the labour market and rising house-
hold incomes. However, the highly favourable setting for household consumption at present
looks set to turn slightly gloomy in the years ahead as demographic constraints soften employ-
ment growth and mounting energy prices erode consumers’ purchasing power. Foreign business,
which will continue to be held back next year by muted growth in global trade, should slowly
gather steam as the markets for German exports improve, but this is unlikely to fully offset the less
vibrant domestic activity.
In this scenario, the German economy could post calendar- adjusted growth rates of 1.8% this
year and next, before expanding at a slightly flatter pace of 1.6% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019 (1.9%
in 2016 and 1.5% in 2017 in unadjusted terms). The rates of expansion expected throughout the
projection horizon are therefore distinctly higher than the increase in potential output. Aggregate
capacity utilisation at the end of the projection horizon is thus likely to be significantly higher than
the long-t erm average. This will be accompanied by mounting labour market bottlenecks that are
still being amplified by unfavourable demographics and will be a catalyst for brisker wage growth.
Barring new expansionary measures, Germany’s public finances are projected to continue gener-
ating surpluses, though these should fall slightly short of last year’s figures. This is being driven by
an expansionary fiscal stance which is being masked by upbeat cyclical factors and dwindling
borrowing costs, however. A steady decline in the debt ratio is projected, possibly down to the
60% limit by 2019.
The sharp fall in energy prices is the chief reason why average consumer price inflation for 2016
remains distinctly muted. Only from next year onwards will the effect of domestic factors prob-
ably begin to become evident. As measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP),
inflation could rise from 0.3% this year to 1.4% next year. Excluding energy, HICP inflation is
expected to climb from 1.1% to 1.4%. With labour costs then projected to pick up more strongly,
both the headline inflation rate and the rate excluding the energy component could increase to
1.7% in 2018 and 1.9% in 2019.
Compared with the June 2016 projection, expectations for economic growth have now been
raised slightly for 2017 and pared back marginally for 2018. Expectations for inflation remain
largely unchanged on the whole. The risks to projected economic growth appear balanced over-
all. Consumer price rises could be stronger than projected here, particularly in 2017, as oil prices
have risen considerably since the assumptions were made. The risks appear balanced in the sub-
sequent years, seeing as the rise in the price of crude oil is then likely to have less of an inflation-
ary effect and it might not be possible to pass on higher labour costs to prices to the extent
assumed here.

Wage dynamics amid high euro- area
unemployment
Wage growth in the euro area was quite strong before the onset of the global financial and
economic crisis. Despite the significant deterioration in the growth outlook, private sector com-
pensation in particular continued to climb in the aftermath of the crisis, though admittedly at a
faltering pace. Developments differed substantially from one country to the next. It was only in
2014 that wage growth finally bottomed out.
There is a body of empirical research which suggests that wages in the euro- area countries
respond more strongly to good labour market conditions than to bad. Wage rigidities might be
behind these asymmetries. Harmonised firm-l evel survey data have revealed that downward
nominal wage rigidity (DNWR) was at play between 2010 and 2013, the period encompassing the
sovereign debt crisis. There is also evidence to suggest that institutional factors had a bearing on
wage dynamics. Real wage rigidity does not appear to have played any major role.
Developments in the public sector proved to be particularly important. Public sector wages in a
host of countries were superior to those in the private sector, and the gap actually widened
signifi cantly in some parts during the years leading up to the global crisis. The fiscal constraints
which made themselves felt during the financial and economic crisis, and later on in the sover-
eign debt crisis, prompted some countries to introduce substantial wage cuts – some temporary,
some permanent – in the public sector, and brought wage levels in the private and public sectors
closer together again.
Greater wage flexibility, first and foremost in the private sector, would probably have helped over-
come the crisis. Microdata analyses, at any rate, show that enterprises which were in a position
to respond to dwindling sales by cutting wages managed to keep their employment situation
steadier than those which could not avail themselves of this option. Also, a simulation study
carried out with the aid of the NiGEM global economic model suggests that wage flexibility can
be conducive to safeguarding employment.
Although conditions in euro- area labour markets have been improving again since the spring of
2013, wage inflation continued to lose traction initially. One likely reason for the flatter trajectory
of wage growth was the absence of wage cuts in the years prior to that date; another was the
dampening effect of the labour market reforms implemented in a number of countries.

German enterprises’ profitability and
financing in 2015
The underlying trend in non- financial corporations’ profitability remained virtually unchanged
from 2014 to 2015. With economic conditions still favourable, firms enjoyed solid sales growth,
and lower purchase prices largely offset cost pressure generated by labour. The renewed rela-
tively sharp increase in staff costs was caused by further payroll growth and higher wages. In
their individual financial statements prepared according to German accounting rules, enterprises
with pension commitments or other long-t erm liabilities additionally had to augment their provi-
sions considerably owing to the reduction in the relevant discount rate. Lastly, one-o ff effects
among individual large firms also dampened aggregate profitability.
The increase in long- term provisions was a decisive reason why the external funds of the non-
financial corporations sector rose in lockstep with equity in 2015. Apart from that, the trend
towards strengthening the capital base continued, with the equity ratio of enterprises without
provisions for pensions continuing to rise considerably, and the equity ratio of enterprises with
provisions for pensions falling only because such provisioning meant that debt outpaced equity.
All other things being equal, the incremental adjustment of provisions to the low- interest- rate
setting mandated by the provisions of German commercial law will continue to reduce earnings
and increase debt for some years to come. The current year is an exception, as the extension of
the reference period for calculating the discount rate is causing movements in the other direction.
Given that profitability is solid overall and balance sheet structures have stabilised, the corporate
sector as a whole will probably have little problem absorbing the expenses it faces, though firms
with high pension commitments might be hit hard. At the end of 2015, pension provisions on
group balance sheets prepared according to international accounting standards undercut the
previous year’s valuation levels as market rates had previously risen briefly.
The scope for internal financing did not increase during the reporting period, with far fewer
profits retained than in 2014. Nonetheless, there was no reduction in cash flow since the drop in
retained profits was due, in part, to increased provisioning. External funds appear to have been
used increasingly to fund the renewed very strong growth in equity investment, in particular. On
the other hand, tangible fixed assets as a percentage of total assets fell somewhat. Given the
steady growth in long- term equity holdings, the strategy of employing financial resources as
efficiently as possible within corporate groups appears to have been gaining traction.
