Economy as a wholeThe German economy’s period of stagnation
continued in the third quarter of 2001. Ac-cording to provisional Federal Statistical Of-fice data, seasonally adjusted real gross do-mestic product (GDP) was 0.1% down on thepreceding three-month period. After adjust-ment for working-day variations and in calen-dar-month terms, there was a year-on-yearincrease of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively,whereas the relevant figure after adjustmentin each case had been as much as + 0.6% inspring. There was thus a further decline in thedegree of overall capacity utilisation. Employ-ment fell again somewhat and, at the end ofthe period under review, was at the samelevel as 12 months earlier.
Any stimuli in the summer months came, in
effect, only from exports. As imports were, atthe same time, tending to weakness, therewas a sharp increase in net exports, with ex-ports being sustained, to a large extent, fromexisting stocks. By contrast, domestic de-mand remained weak. In particular, there wasa further significant reduction in investmentin machinery and equipment.
Private consumption became only slightly
more expensive in the third quarter. Year-on-year, the price deflator went down to 1.7%.There was, on the other hand, a sharp deteri-oration in the terms of trade. This was mainlydue to special effects in the case of exportprices due to claims on German reinsuranceenterprises in the wake of the terrorist attacksGDP in Q3

6in the United States. Without this factor,
which also influenced the GDP deflator, therewould have been a substantial improvementin the terms of trade in the national accountssimilar to that in the foreign trade price statis-tics.
ManufacturingThe cyclical slowdown in manufacturing con-
tinued in October, with incoming ordersshowing a seasonally adjusted fall again inthe early autumn. The decline was, at least,not as sharp as in September, when – prob-ably in connection with the terrorist attacks inthe United States – there had been an abrupt,perceptible downturn. In October, the figurewas 9
12% down on the year, compared witha year-on-year decline of 512% on an aver-
age of the third quarter.
While domestic orders have been declining
right up to the present, foreign demand inOctober held up at the depressed level of theprevious month. Even so, the year-on-yeardownturn in exports, at 11
14%, was notice-
ably higher than that in domestic business,where a figure of – 7
34% was recorded.
The decline in manufacturing output had
been comparatively limited in September inseasonally adjusted terms, but accelerated inOctober, being almost 3% down on the aver-age level of the summer months. The year-on-year figure was – 3
34%, having been
–114% in the third quarter.
ConstructionIn seasonally adjusted terms, there was a sig-
nificant deterioration in the demand for con-struction work in September – more recentfigures are unavailable at present. This meansthat there was no continuation of the slightimprovement that showed up in August. Inthe third quarter as a whole, the level of thespring months, which had brought a tempor-ary improvement, was undershot by 7
12%.
The year-on-year fall increased again to 4 %,compared with a figure of – 1
12% in the
second quarter.
At a seasonally adjusted – 14%, demand for
residential construction work in the summermonths all but collapsed when comparedwith the spring. Public sector contractors cutback their orders by 8

7period. Industrial orders were reduced by
3%.
The level of construction output is likely to
have been more or less just as high in Octoberas it had been in the preceding months. It isnot possible to state this with precision, how-ever, since the latest figures have alreadybeen adjusted to this year’s overall survey,whereas those for the previous months up toFebruary have yet to be revised. The year-on-year decline in output for October amountsto 4%, which is much less than was statedon the basis of the provisional figures for thethird quarter (– 9
12%).
Labour marketThere has been a further deterioration in the
situation on the labour market. According tothe initial estimation of the Federal StatisticalOffice, the seasonally adjusted number ofpersons in work fell to 38.75 million in Sep-tember, i.e. almost 50,000 fewer than at theturn of 2000-01 and roughly just as many asduring the same period of 2000.
There has been a further increase in un-
employment. At the end of November,3.94 million persons were registered as un-employed at the labour exchanges. This wasa rise of around 70,000 compared with thethird quarter and of nearly 145,000 on theyear. The unemployment rate, as defined bythe Federal Labour Office, remained at a sea-sonally adjusted 9.5%. The standardised fig-ure was 8.0%.Economic conditions in Germany*

8In November, around 170,000 employees
were on short time, i.e. almost 100,000 morethan 12 months previously. Seasonally adjust-ed, the number of reported vacancies fell to475,000, signifying a fall of 60,000 on theyear.
PricesThe rate of price increase was slowing down
up to the end of the period under review.According to the national consumer priceindex, consumer prices fell somewhat inNovember in seasonally adjusted terms. Theyear-on-year rate went down to 1.7% from2.0% in October. This decline was due mainlyto persistent sharp falls in energy prices and –counter to the seasonal trend – a clear easingin the prices of food. Excluding these twogroups of goods, the rate of inflation was1.8%, compared with 1.7% in the precedingmonths.
According to the Harmonised Index of Con-
sumer Prices (HICP), which is calculated forthe purpose of improving comparability withprice developments in other euro-area coun-tries, the year-on-year rate of inflation fellfrom 2.0% in October to 1.5% in November.This sharp decline (which is more pronouncedthan when using the national index) is mainlydue to the fact that owner-occupied housingis not included in the HICP . This means thatgroups of goods showing sharp falls in pricesat the end of the period under review (foodand energy) are given a greater weight.
Prices also declined at the preliminary stages
of production. Year-on-year import priceswere down 5.6% in October, compared with
a figure of – 3.6% in the preceding month.The producer prices of manufactured goodswere now only 0.6% higher than in the sameperiod of 2000, compared with 1.9% in Sep-tember.
Public finance
Government indebtednessIn October the central, regional and local
authorities stepped up their indebtednesssharply by 310.7 billion, following an expan-
sion of 31.1 billion in September. The liabil-
ities of the Federal Government increased by34.2 billion. While the volume of outstand-
ing money market loans was reduced by32.1 billion by the end of the month, new
net borrowing on the capital market reached36.2 billion. In particular, the Federal Govern-
ment recorded a gross inflow of 310.1 billion
from an issue of Treasury discount paper(Bubills). With a refinancing requirement of
36.6 billion, these securities pushed up the
Federal Government’s net debt by 33.4 bil-
lion. The planned doubling of the amountoutstanding in comparison with previousyears to currently around 320 billion has con-
sequently been accomplished. Notable in-creases in outstanding volumes of otherFederal securities resulted from the sale ofmarket management stocks of Federal bonds(Bunds) for32.1 billion and Federal Treasury
notes (Schätze) for31 billion.

celerated significantly. After obtaining a total

9of314.9 billion during the first three quar-
ters, they tapped the markets for 36.5 billion
in October, which was the highest monthlynet borrowing figure recorded in 2001.While their liabilities arising from loansagainst borrowers’ notes remained virtuallyunchanged in October, they covered approxi-mately a quarter of their financing require-ment through short-term cash advances frombanks ( 31.7 billion). However, the Länder
Governments principally resorted to the issu-ance of Treasury notes with almost exclusivelylong-term maturities which yielded 35.2 bil-
lion gross and 34.8 billion net. The Länder
Governments had already issued a relativelylarge volume of Treasury notes in September.This reflects a shift on the part of the LänderGovernments away from the borrower’snotes market; this trend, which has been in-creasingly evident this year, is additionallycharacterised by a growing focus on large-volume issues with a greater liquidity. The off-budget special funds reduced their indebted-ness by a marginal 30.5 billion. The local au-
thorities appear to have drawn on the creditmarkets to a somewhat larger extent in Octo-ber than in the preceding months.
Federal Government borrowingIn November the Federal Government in-
creased its indebtedness by 36.5 billion. Its
money market liabilities expanded by no lessthan 310.4 billion. In the capital market, by
contrast, it redeemed 33.9 billion on bal-
ance. Gross borrowing in the capital marketmainly took the form of a reopening auctionof the 138 series of five-year special Federalbonds (Bobls) . As these Bobls were originallyissued with a coupon of 4.5%, a relatively
high price mark-up was attained amid themore favourable market conditions now pre-vailing. Gross receipts of 36.3 billion from
the auction plus 30.3 billion from current
sales were more than offset by a redemptionrequirement of 38 billion, with the result that
the outstanding volume of Bobls contracted
by31.4 billion. There was a decrease, too, in
the outstanding amount of Federal savingsbonds by 31.9 billion because of the con-
tinued very sluggish demand for these secur-ities. Loans against borrowers’ notes werelikewise redeemed on balance by 31.3 bil-
lion. Sales of Bunds andSchätze from market
management stocks yielded a combined nettotal of 30.8 billion.Net borrowing in the market

Bond marketSales in the German bond market continued
to pick up in October. Domestic borrowers is-sued bonds to the market value of 377.9 bil-
lion, compared with 367.6 billion in Septem-
ber. Net of redemptions, and after taking dueaccount of changes in issuers’ holdings oftheir own bonds, net sales came to 318.3 bil-
lion, compared with 38.2 billion in Sep-
tember. They consisted – as in the previousmonth – primarily of shorter-term paper (withmaturities of up to and including four years).Foreign bonds were placed in the Germanmarket to the value of 38.2 billion net; more
than 50% of them were bonds denominatedin foreign currencies. Overall, net sales ofdomestic and foreign debt securities yielded
326.6 billion in October, compared with 39.4
billion a month before.
In October, two-thirds of the domestic bonds
were issued by the public sector ( 311.9 bil-
lion net). The Federal Government received37.1 billion net from sales of debt securities.
It launched by tender Treasury discountpaper (Bubills) to the value of 310.2 billion.
On balance, the outstanding amount of suchpaper increased by 33.4 billion. Net sales of
ten-year bonds and Federal Treasury notescame to 31 . 3b i l l i o na n d 31.2 billion, re-
spectively. Five-year special Federal bondswere sold to the extent of 30.1 billion.
1The
outstanding amount of Federal savingsbonds, however, declined by 30.6 billion. In
October, the Länder Governments launchedbonds totalling 34.7 billion net; that was
once again more than in the previous month(33.9 billion).
Credit institutions received 33.6 billion net
from sales of their own debt securities. Debtsecurities issued by specialised credit institu-tions were in the forefront, at 34.7 billion.
Mortgage Pfandbriefe were sold to the tune
of32.4 billion net, while public Pfandbriefe
and other bank bonds were repurchased tothe extent of 32.1 billion and 31.5 billion

11Net sales of corporate bonds amounted to
32.8 billion in October, and thus were dis-
tinctly higher than in the previous month(31.2 billion) and a year before (October
2000: 31.0 billion).
Gross sales of Deutsche Mark/euro bonds
issued by non-residents under the lead-management of German syndicates came to32.4 billion in October. In September, no
paper of that kind had been issued. After de-duction of redemptions, the outstandingamount declined by 30.5 billion.
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mestic non-banks were again in the forefrontin October. They increased their bond port-folios by 313.5 billion, consisting predomin-
antly of bonds issued by non-residents, at38.3 billion. Foreign investors placed 312.8
billion net in domestic bonds, the major partof this sum in public sector bonds. Domesticcredit institutions purchased bonds totalling30.2 billion net.
Equity marketIn October, domestic enterprises placed new
shares in the equity market to the marketvalue of 34.1 billion, and thus distinctly more
than in the previous month ( 31.2 billion).
Foreign equities were sold in the Germanmarket to the extent of 33.9 billion net,
whereas domestic investors had reduced theirportfolios of foreign equities by 37.9 billion
in September. Overall, domestic and foreignequities to the tune of 38.0 billion were sold
in the German equity market in October.In October, domestic non-banks bought equi-
ties to the value of 36.0 billion (net). Domes-
tic credit institutions increased their shareholdings by 31.4 billion net. They exchanged
foreign shares (– 31.2 billion) for domestic
paper ( 32.6 billion). Foreign investors pur-
chased German equities totalling 30.6 billion
net. On balance, they made only portfolio in-vestments.
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds came to 37.4 billion in October, com-
pared with 30.4 billion in the previous
month. 50% of that sum was invested inspecialised funds and 50% in funds open tothe general public. Among the latter funds,money-market funds received the major partSales and purchases of bonds

estate funds and bond-based funds sold cer-tificates to the extent of 31.0 billion and
30.8 billion, respectively. Share-based funds
and funds of funds received 30.3 billion and
30.1 billion, respectively. In the case of spe-
cialised funds, the bulk of the amount was in-vested in mixed funds ( 33.3 billion). Bond-
based funds and open-end real estate fundsreceived 30.5 billion and 30.2 billion, re-
spectively. In October, at 31.9 billion, foreign
fund certificates were sold in the Germanmarket to a somewhat greater extent than inSeptember ( 31.7 billion). The total amount
raised by sales of domestic and foreign invest-ment fund certificates thus came to 39.3 bil-
lion.
The investment fund certificates were mostly
bought by domestic non-banks ( 37.5 billion).
They mainly purchased domestic fund certifi-cates. Non-residents bought certificates ofGerman funds amounting to 31.2 billion.
Credit institutions’ holdings of investmentfund certificates rose by 30.6 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, cross-border factor income and current transfers –ran a surplus of 34.4 billion in October com-
pared with a deficit of 30.4 billion in Septem-
ber. The substantial improvement in the cur-rent account is due mainly to a larger tradesurplus and an increase in net factor income.According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, the surplus on trade in goodsamounted to 39.1 billion in October. This
was 32.7 billion more than in the previous
month; the foreign trade balance alsoshowed a significant improvement after elim-ination of seasonal factors. In seasonally ad-justed terms exports of goods grew by justover
12% in October compared with Septem-
ber, but they were 1% below the average forthe third quarter. Imports of goods in Octoberdeclined by 2
12% in value compared with
the previous month and remained just under2% below the third-quarter average.
Net expenditure on invisible current transac-
tions with non-residents fell to 34.3 billion in
October compared with 36.2 billion in Sep-
tember. This was due in large measure to theincrease in net income from investment. Netcross-border factor income exceeded the pre-vious month’s level by 32.0 billion. The deficit
on services was also slightly lower than in theprevious month ( 33.8 billion in October com-
pared with 34.1 billion in September). By
contrast, net current transfers to non-resi-dents rose slightly in October (by 30.4 bil-
lion).
The cross-border flows through portfolio in-
vestment, which had slowed down in Sep-tember, accelerated again in October. Ger-man residents stepped up their acquisitionsof foreign securities in October ( 311.5 billion)
whereas in September they had cut back ontheir foreign investment for a time. In themonth under review they invested 38.2 bil-
lion in foreign bonds and notes, 31.9 billion

1331.4 billion in foreign shares. Foreign de-
mand for German securities also rose mark-edly, namely from 39.7 billion in September
to315.1 billion in October. At 314.0 billion,
non-residents invested the bulk of this sum inGerman bonds and notes, notably publicbonds. They also bought German sharesworth 31.1 billion. All in all, portfolio invest-
ment resulted in net capital imports of 33.6
billion compared with 314.8 billion a month
earlier.
In the case of direct investment, by contrast,
there were net capital exports of 35.9 billion
in October (September: plus 33.3 billion).
German proprietors provided their subsidiar-ies domiciled abroad with 36.6 billion in in-
vestable funds, predominantly in the form ofadditional equity capital. Foreign enterprisesinvested no more than 30.7 billion net in
their subsidiaries domiciled in Germany.
The non-securitised credit transactions of
non-banks likewise resulted in net capital ex-ports as a whole in October. Enterprises andindividuals transferred 32.5 billion net
abroad, thereby slightly increasing their bal-ances with foreign banks. The operations ofgeneral government, by contrast, led to acapital influx of 31.7 billion, principally as the
result of short-term borrowing abroad. Theexternal business conducted by the Germanbanking system was very modest whenviewed in net terms. On balance, there wereexports of funds not only by the Germancredit institutions ( 31.5 billion) but also as a
result of account movements at the Bundes-bank ( 30.3 billion).Major items of the balance

integrationof Germansecurities marketsRecent decades have witnessed a rapid
growth in the financial markets. At thesame time, there has been an increasein their international integration. InEurope this integration process hasbeen further accelerated by Europeanmonetary union. This article looks atthe extent to which the German secur-ities markets are integrated inter-nationally and the implications thatthis may have. A look at securities pricessuggests that integration is well ad-vanced. However, the relatively limitedholdings of foreign securities indicatethat there is still scope for further diver-sification. Integrated securities marketsbroaden the range of investment op-portunities, reduce capital costs andhelp to boost market liquidity, price ef-ficiency and risk sharing. However, theyalso increase international contagionrisks. Measures to restrict the move-ment of capital are nonetheless un-acceptable. Since the integration of thefinancial markets increases welfare, itshould not be impeded. Rather, marketplayers should take appropriate ac-count of market risks. They need to ac-cept responsibility for their own lossesand mature risk management systemsmust be developed.

16markets. The figures say it all. For example,
the annual volume of cross-border securitiestransactions
1in Germany increased from
412% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the
early 1970s to 450% of GDP in 2000. Ger-man investors now hold a wide range of se-curities of various origins. Conversely, non-residents are investing in virtually every sectorof the German capital market.
Extensive international capital movements
are, however, not necessarily synonymouswith integrated financial markets. Before theoutbreak of World War I the ratio of net cap-ital flows to economic performance was farhigher than in the 1990s. It would nonethe-less be difficult to talk of global financial mar-kets having existed at that time – with the ex-ception of one or two sectors. Owing to thehigh information barriers in place at the time,international transactions focused mainly ongovernment bonds and debt securities issuedby railway companies or public utilities; the“tangibility” of their assets made it compara-tively easy to monitor the use of the funds.
2
Today, by contrast, international capitalmovements cover a far broader range of se-curities, including equities and derivatives.The transfer of capital is less significant thanrisk spreading. This is reflected in large grosscapital flows which far exceed net flows.
In one respect, however, the present-day glob-
alisation of the financial markets is scarcelyany different from the pre-1914 situation. Atthat time, the international flows of capitalwere restricted to relatively few countries.Most funds flowed into countries with similarlegal systems or to a country’s own colonies.Nowadays, investments are focused mainly on
the industrial countries and a small, but in-creasing, number of emerging economies.From 1992 to 1997, for instance, more thanone-half of all investments made outside theindustrial countries (excluding developmentassistance) were channelled to five countries –China, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Korea.From this perspective, global integration of thefinancial markets has not yet been achieved.
This article deals with the effects of market
integration on the capital market in Germany.First, however, the actual degree of integra-tion of the international financial markets isexamined. The empirical results of this analy-sis are then taken as the basis from which todetermine the impact on the various capitalmarket players as well as on monetary policyand the stability of the financial system.
Financial market integration:
definition and empirical evidence
Financial markets are said to be integrated if
there are no obstacles to capital movements.In fully integrated markets the transactioncosts (in the broadest sense) of moving cap-ital from one country to another are the sameas those for capital movements within onecountry. The same types of securities aretherefore traded at the same prices, irrespect-ive of where the transactions take place or

vestors abroad and foreign investors in Germany.

17who is trading. Deviations from this “law of
one price” may therefore be able to shedlight on obstacles to international capitalmovements and their significance. However,empirical studies on this subject are handi-capped by the fact that only very few secur-ities denominated in the same currency withthe same maturity and the same risk aretraded in different countries. One examplewould be equities listed on the stock ex-changes of different countries. Yield differen-tials of investments that are denominated indifferent currencies or different price move-ments on the equity markets in two countriesmay not, however, be taken unquestioninglyas indicative of limited capital mobility as theycan just as easily be attributed to expectedexchange rate movements, different riskevaluations or profit potential. Before yieldson paper denominated in different currenciescan be compared, all payments in a foreigncurrency need to be converted into a refer-ence currency at the relevant forward ex-change rate. For instance, in accordance withcovered interest rate parity, the interest rateon an investment denominated in euro oughtto be the same as the corresponding dollarrate adjusted by the euro-dollar forward rate.However, tests based on covered interest rateparity can be carried out only for short matur-ities of up to one year as there is no liquid for-ward exchange market for longer maturities.
Studies of the “law of one price” all report
interest rate differentials in the interbankmarket and divergences, albeit very small,from covered interest rate parity. It is there-fore safe to say that the markets are largelyintegrated, at least at the short end. Withinthe euro area, rates for long-term interest
rate swaps hardly vary at all, although thereare differences in the prices of bonds withlonger maturities. However, these differencesare probably attributable to other factors – inparticular, the different credit ratings award-ed to borrowers and the existence of liquidfutures markets – and are therefore notnecessarily an indication of market segmen-tation. There is no consistent evidence of theintegration of the equity markets.
3
Close international co-movements in prices,as might be expected in integrated markets,do not mean that national factors cease toplay any role at all – at least not as long as na-tional or regional influences, such as econom-ic policy, continue to exist. Consequently,small price correlations between differentmarkets do not necessarily indicate that mar-kets are segmented. However, a sort of “lawof one price” should be applicable here, too.The valuation of the price component thatcan be traced back to common influencesshould be the same if markets are integrated.A further test of market integration can beformulated on this basis. First, a statisticalprocedure is used to identify a common pricefactor. Then the impact of this factor on pri-cing is assessed. The results of this kind oftest indicate that financial markets are be-coming increasingly integrated but do notrule out a certain amount of segmentation. Inany case, it must be remembered that thereare slight differences in the valuation of com-mon factors even within the different seg-ments of a given market. The tests therefore

esis of full market integration even when thedivergences are minor.

The degree of integration of international fi-nancial markets can also be determined bylooking at trading volumes. In the case ofequities, the value of domestic investors’ pur-chases and sales of foreign paper has in-creased more than tenfold in the past fiveyears, to 31.5 trillion in 2000. The same vol-
ume of German shares was traded by foreigninvestors in 2000. The development in bondsand notes was less marked. Owing to thestart of monetary union, Germany probablylost some of its appeal for international in-vestors as the introduction of the single cur-rency meant that interest rate advantages ofbonds issued in other euro-area countriescould be achieved without having to run therisk of depreciation. The purchase of Germanfixed-interest securities by non-residents hasremained steady in recent years. At the sametime, however, domestic investors have pur-chased three times the amount of foreigndebt securities. Investment funds also reportan increase in amounts being invested in se-curities issued by non-residents.
The size of the flows can, however, be influ-
enced by investors trading for liquidity reasonsand by short-term transactions. The long-termdevelopment of the size of holdings is a betterway of measuring changes in investment be-haviour. The international distribution of secur-ities portfolios is therefore frequently taken asa yardstick for the integration of the financialmarkets. In Germany the proportion of foreignsecurities in domestic private customers’ secur-ities deposits at the end of 2000 was 41%. Al-
though this meant that it was 20 percentagepoints up on 1987, it was still far below thekind of figures which would be considered op-timal for conventional portfolio structures ifmarkets were integrated. If the global marketshare of German and foreign securities is takenas the reference value for the distribution of aninternationally diversified portfolio, last year amaximum of 5% of the equities held and lessthan 15% of the bonds in safe custody de-posits would have come from domestic is-suers.
5Calculations which take account of the
largest industrial countries only and assumesome degree of risk aversion still show an “op-timal” share of domestic stocks and bonds ofb e t w e e n2 0 %a n d3 0 % .
6The comparatively
very strong domestic orientation – the homebias – of private investors’ securities portfolios,taken per se, would initially appear to suggest
that there are all kinds of impediments to theinternational movement of capital.

A differentiated analysis shows, however, that,at one-quarter, the share of foreign securities

smaller than in the case of indirect investmentvia domestic investment funds open to the gen-eral public, which, in any case, invested justunder two-thirds of their assets abroad. Theretherefore seem to be a declining number ofobstacles to cross-border trading for institution-al investors, who manage a far larger volumeof investments than most private investors.However, there are variations here, too. Al-though insurance companies, as a further insti-tutional investor group, frequently hold a con-siderable volume of securities, their share of for-eign holdings is far smaller than is the case forinvestment company funds, which includefunds open to the general public and special-ised funds (see the chart on page 20). Insurancecompanies are affected to some extent by cur-rency restrictions imposed by national pruden-tial law. Impediments to a more marked inter-nationalisation of the securities markets appearto be related to features of individual investorsor investor groups, such as their size or theirlegal form. With the elimination of foreign ex-change risk within Europe and the increasinginstitutionalisation of investments, however, thesignificance of some of these impediments iswaning. A further obstacle in Germany wasthat the corporate taxation imputation systemcould be applied only to disbursements madeby domestic corporations. Tax reform and therelated changeover to the “half-income proced-ure” have done away with this discrimination.
The trend towards the internationalisation of
securities portfolios has accelerated furthersince the start of monetary union. This appliesto all investor groups, but especially to invest-ment funds. At the end of 1998 foreign secur-ities accounted for well below one-half of the
total equity and bond assets of domestic in-vestment funds open to the general public. Bythe end of 2000 the holdings of foreign sharesby domestic investment funds, in particular,had risen to 70%, i.e. to a level indicative ofthe virtual lack of any “home bias”.
8There
was a noteworthy development in bonds andnotes. From 1 January 1999, for instance, resi-dent investors had been purchasing a largevolume of debt securities issued by non-residents and denominated in euro only. Thewidening distribution of securities holdingsdid not therefore go hand in hand with a fur-ther diversification of currency risks as, in re-turn, these resident investors sold bonds de-nominated in currencies other than the euro.International spread of securities

20The macroeconomic implications of capital
mobility lay the foundations for a further typeof test for market integration. Such tests as-sume that investment decisions in an econ-omy offset the effects of shocks to savings orinvestment and permit the smoothing of con-sumption over time.
9For instance, integrated
financial markets should ensure that local in-vestment can be easily financed from theworldwide pool of savings, i.e. without trig-gering large fluctuations in interest rates,
even in the event of a sharp decline in domes-tic savings. The ease with which fluctuationsin the consumption path of a country’s invest-ors can be offset is also said to imply thatthere is a high degree of integration in theglobal financial markets. Short-term restric-tions on potential consumption that arecaused by volatile output and investment re-sults could then be offset by lagged or evencontrary investment results in other countries.The method of measuring the integration ofinternational financial markets first applied byFeldstein and Horioka regresses national sav-ing rates on domestic investment rates. In aperfect capital mobility scenario, no part ofan increase in savings, or only a very limitedproportion of that increase, would remain forinvestment in the domestic market as itwould be possible to channel additional fi-nancial resources to where they would bemost productive on a global basis. Empiricalresults of time series and cross-sectional an-alyses, however, point to a high correlation ofnational investment and saving ratios.

21somewhat in the past two years. These fig-
ures confirm the results of other studieswhich show a strong – if declining – degreeof segmentation of the financial markets.However, if account is taken of the fact thatthis kind of integration test also implicitlytests global real interest rate parity and maybe distorted by the size of a country, demo-graphic factors or government expenditure, ahigh degree of correlation does not automat-ically mean that there is little financial marketintegration. Neither is there any empiricalconfirmation of the marked consumptionsmoothing over time assumed in open capitalmarkets.
12However, other influential factors
such as the share of non-tradable goods can,here too, be the cause of different consump-tion patterns in different countries and limitthe information value of these tests in termsof financial market integration.
All in all, the various tests do not provide any
consistent results on the degree of market in-tegration. The slight differences in interestrates between the domestic and the foreignmarkets and the applicability of covered inter-est rate parity indicate broad market integra-tion, at least from the point of view of prices.The number of internationally active marketplayers would appear to ensure that any pricedifferentials which are not based on the dif-ferent risk features of the securities are swiftlyeliminated.
On the other hand, the “home bias” of secur-
ities portfolios suggests that obstacles to fullmarket integration still exist, even if they ap-pear to be decreasing in importance. Theseobstacles may include direct transaction costswhich arise from difficulties when securities
are traded on a cross-border basis. Thesecosts frequently vary from one market seg-ment to another as well as across investorgroups. For instance, the dominant players onthe money market are large, institutional in-vestors, especially banks. Sales and purchasesare made according to a standard procedure.Within the euro area liquidity adjustmentsand portfolio shifts rarely involve any friction.For small, private investors cross-border trans-actions – such as cross-border credit trans-fers – are, however, still partly associated withhigh costs. In addition, costs related to boththe preparation of information and its pro-cessing certainly also play an important role.Nowadays, small-scale investors can use theInternet to access virtually the same range ofinformation as institutional investors. Themore marked “home bias” among private in-vestors cannot therefore be explained by theirhaving no access to information. However,the easier information is to obtain, the great-er the processing requirements. Institutionalinvestors are at an advantage here. In add-ition to the ongoing globalisation of the se-curities markets, a tendency for investmentdecisions to be entrusted more frequently toprofessionals is therefore to be expected.
However, at more than 4 percentage points
on average from 1991 to 2000, the estimatedopportunity costs of the present investmentstructure in Germany are high in relation toportfolios diversified in line with the conven-

pite these notes of caution and althoughcross-border investment has increased consid-erably – especially since the establishment ofmonetary union – there is still scope for diver-sification.
Effects on financial market players
InvestorsThe international integration of the securities
markets has opened up new investment per-spectives for domestic investors both institu-tional and private. Transaction costs are thesame for purchases of a broad range of secur-ities, enabling investors to pursue their yieldand hedging targets better than in non-integrated markets. More precisely targetedportfolio combinations which correspond toinvestors’ hedging requirements can be fash-ioned from the wider range of investment op-portunities. However, investors cannot pro-tect their portfolios against global risks whichaffect the prices of all securities investmentsequally and cannot therefore be diversified.
Investors also benefit from the increase in li-
quidity associated with capital market inte-gration. As the number of investors increases,so do the competition for profitable securitiesinvestments and the number of transactionrequests. Liquidity is thus an expression of aninvestor’s confidence in his ability to adjust hissecurities portfolio promptly in the light ofnew information. In turn, increased confi-dence in being able to trade immediately alsoincreases the level of liquidity. This ability todraw in liquidity is dependent, however, on
the pricing of securities being transparent forbuyers and sellers alike. The electronic tradingplatforms are also a useful means of groupingtogether investors’ purchase requirements,regardless of their location, and of promotingprice transparency. The more transaction re-quests are grouped together, the greater thespeed at which they can be executed and thenarrower the gap between bid and sellingrates. This is an important advantage of inte-gration, particularly for large-scale institution-al investors.
From the investors’ perspective, European
monetary union has not only made cross-bor-der securities transactions easier but has alsoaltered the relative importance of countryand sector risks. Sector-related factors areclearly replacing the now absent exchangerate risks as the driving force behind portfoliomanagement within the euro area.
14More-
over, economic convergence among the EMUmember states is helping to push country-specific risks in portfolio structures into thebackground. Recent surveys carried outamong portfolio managers reveal, for in-stance, that European equity portfolios arestructured primarily on the basis of sectoralinformation.

23Issuers
In integrated markets issuers are less reliant
on raising funds in their own country; foreigninvestors are increasingly ready to respond.This leads to an increase in primary market li-quidity, which tends to cut capital costs.Moreover, in contrast to the situation in seg-mented financial markets, even large issuesare comparatively easy to place. Greater cap-ital market integration certainly also providesdomestic investors with greater investmentopportunities abroad. This means that do-mestic borrowers find themselves faced withincreasing competition from non-resident is-suers. In turn, tougher competition for capitalgives issuers an incentive, owing to econ-omies of scale, to make their flotations largerand therefore cheaper.
As capital markets become more and more
integrated, there is growing pressure forinternational balance sheet standards andsupervisory structures. This is apparent, forexample, from the fact that most of the en-terprises listed on the DAX present their bal-ance sheet according to international stand-ards (IAS or US GAAP), although this is not aprerequisite for inclusion in the DAX. A stand-ard and therefore transparent reporting for-mat reduces information asymmetries be-tween investors and issuers and thus reducescapital costs.
16Greater investor confidence in
issuers raises market liquidity – through re-duced bid-ask spreads, low price volatility orlarge trade volumes, for example. The transi-tion to international disclosure regulationsalso helps to intensify international competi-tion for capital and attracts foreign invest-ment. The influence of non-resident investors
on management increases in line with theircommitment to domestic equities. For in-stance, there are indications that country-specific variations in corporate governancestructures have become smaller as a result ofinternational financial market integration.
17
Financial intermediaries
From the point of view of the credit institu-
tions and other financial intermediaries, theinternational integration of securities marketsmeans tougher competition. As investors andissuers no longer rely solely on the domesticmarket when investing or borrowing, thetraditional predominance of domestic finan-cial institutions is being undermined. They arenow subject to competition from both Ger-man branches of foreign intermediaries anddomestic customers’ direct links with financialservice providers domiciled abroad; this latteraspect has recently assumed greater import-ance as a result of the Internet being morewidely used.
Depending on the market sector concerned,
however, competitive pressure can vary quiteconsiderably. It is especially high in invest-ment banking and in large-scale lending.However, it has become difficult even for“firmly established” sectors such as privateand retail banking to avoid tougher competi-

24tion in the long run.18It is now easier for in-
vestors to access foreign markets, meaningthat where a security is traded has become in-creasingly irrelevant. For example, DeutscheBörse AG already has trading terminals in theUnited States, and some German banks carryout their US bond business from Frankfurt.Clearly, the more intense competitive pres-sure inherent in integrated financial marketsdoes not affect credit institutions alone; it hasalso led to major changes in the stock ex-change environment. The days of strictly na-tional stock exchanges are over. The Euro-pean stock exchange environment has under-gone a major change in recent years. Al-though the efforts of the leading Europeanstock exchanges to form a joint trading sys-tem have met with little success, consolida-tion attempts have now begun to make pro-gress.
Efficiency gains in return for greater risk?
Capital market prices have a key role in allo-
cating an economy’s resources. Only if theprices of assets are “efficient”, i.e. they actu-ally reflect all relevant information known tothe market participants, is capital channelledto its most efficient use. International finan-cial market integration contributes to this intwo ways. First, only if markets are integratedis it possible for investors to avoid having toopt for a less profitable investment in theirown country as opposed to a more profitableone abroad. Second, integrating financialmarkets improve market liquidity, which isvital to efficient price formation. In turn, itthus ensures that capital allocation is effi-
cient.
Of course, this applies only to ordered market
conditions, and less in times of a crisis. Evenso, the relationship between financial marketintegration and the stability of the financialsystem is extremely complex. On the onehand, an integrated financial market tends tocushion local shocks better than segmentedmarkets, as spreading the burden of risk re-duces the danger of national financial sys-tems collapsing. On the other hand, inter-national risk sharing does have its downside.In an integrated global financial system, it isdifficult to confine turbulence to specific mar-ket segments. Indeed, it can spread swiftly tothe whole system – even if it is more resilientoverall than each national market individually.In economic terms, what the disparity be-tween the greater capacity to absorb individ-ual risks and the international transmission ofshocks means in practice should be clearfrom two examples: first, finding the capitalneeded to finance German reunification and,second, the contagion effects during the tur-moil on the international financial markets inthe autumn of 1998.
The capacity of internationally integrated fi-
nancial markets to cope with a high nationaldemand for capital was evident in the periodfollowing German reunification. The consid-erable need to finance western Germany’s

cessary investment in infrastructure was metmainly by the Federal Government, whichborrowed funds primarily in the capital mar-ket. Public sector bond market debt rose bynearly DM 90 billion in both 1990 and 1991.Following the securitisation of financial bur-dens such as the equalisation claims relatingto currency conversion, net sales of govern-ment bonds reached their peak in the follow-ing two years, at DM 190 billion and thenDM 240 billion. In the same period net invest-ments by non-resident in German govern-ment debt securities rose to many times theaverage of the previous 20 years; in 1992 and1993 it amounted to DM 80 billion andDM 150 billion respectively (see the chart onpage 26). The high level of non-resident fi-nancing of government debt also is also com-mensurate with the fact that there was only aslight increase in the saving rate of domestichouseholds briefly at the start of the 1990sbefore it decreased again.
At the end of the 1980s long-term nominal
and real interest rates rose considerably inGermany, peaking – also as a result of the ex-pected financial burden relating to reunifica-tion in 1990 – at more than 9% or 5

This illustrates theinfluence which a considerable expansion inthe national demand for capital on interlinkedmarkets can exert on capital allocation in
other countries. The internationally inte-grated capital markets not only met a consid-erable volume of Germany’s financing needsrelating to reunification but also absorbedDM

26some of the price effects. Certainly, non-
resident investors also had a share in Germa-ny’s reunification boom.
There are numerous examples of financial
market turmoil spreading rapidly. During theAsian crisis in the second half of 1997 thespeculative attacks which followed the de-valuation of the Thai baht spread in severalwaves to one country after another. This kindof contagion effect was, however, not limitedto emerging markets. In October 1998, for in-stance, liquidity dried up for a time in import-ant sectors of the international financial mar-kets, although some of these markets hadoriginally not been affected at all. In Germanymarked price fluctuations on the market forFederal bonds which, owing to a large vol-ume of issues and the available forward mar-ket instruments, is highly liquid in quietphases, resulted in a considerable broadeningof bid-ask spreads. This indicates that marketliquidity was very limited at the time.
20The
example makes it clear that even large, liquidmarkets can be subject to disruptions.
Effects on monetary policy
For monetary policy, the positive effects of in-
tegrated capital markets – greater liquidityand efficient allocation of capital – mean thatthere are no long time lags before monetaryimpulses are reflected in the prices of finan-cial assets and that the signals sent out byinterest rate decisions are processed rapidlyby the markets. Monetary policy time lagsthus become shorter.However, the globalisation of financial mar-
kets has also brought about a change in themonetary policy transmission process. For in-stance, effects felt via the exchange ratechannel become more significant. In the caseof open financial markets, a tightening ofmonetary policy generates an inflow of cap-ital and thus tends to lead to an appreciationof the domestic currency. The potential con-flict of aims between fixed exchange ratesand independent monetary policy becomesgreater. Central banks which conduct an in-dependent monetary policy because of thesize of their currency area therefore find it dif-ficult to survive in integrated financial mar-kets without the linchpin of flexible exchangerates.
Similarly, where markets are globalised, asset
prices become more important in terms ofthe transfer of monetary impulses, as the re-lationship between prices and foreign finan-cial assets has a stronger impact on investors’reactions to monetary policy decisions. Theeffects of a change in the interest rate thenbecome more complex, with the result that itbecomes correspondingly more difficult todecide when a monetary policy measureshould be used and how stringent it shouldbe.

27stability of the financial system. The question
is therefore how the viability of the marketsand the financial sector as a whole can be im-proved without undermining the consider-able advantages of globalised financial mar-kets for investors and issuers.
Proposals which ultimately mean segmenta-
tion of the financial markets pay little heed tothis requirement of stability. One such pro-posal would be the call for the reintroductionof capital movement controls. Legal and ad-ministrative barriers can put a stop to capitaloutflows at most in the very short run; in thelong run, however, they can be easily circum-vented.
Neither is the tax on international transac-
tions proposed by James Tobin an appropriateway to avoid crises. The purpose of the taxwas to make short-term investment (viewedas having a particularly destabilising effect)more expensive. When, however, exchangerates are very volatile in times of crises, thetax has less impact than in times of minorprice fluctuations. In addition, it is debatablewhether short-term capital flows can beequated with destabilising speculation. Thereis still a risk that some “acceptable” types ofshort-term financial transactions, such as thefinancing of external trade or hedging oper-ations, fare worse under a Tobin tax thanspeculative investments. Ultimately, a Tobintax would also go hand in hand with the riskof more transactions being shifted to taxhavens. Such evasive action involving lessregulated areas would tend to be detrimentalto financial market stability.Evasive tactics are not the only arguments
against the introduction of capital movementcontrols or a Tobin tax. Each obstacle put inthe way of international capital movementssimultaneously reduces the positive effects ofglobalisation such as increased market liquid-ity and price efficiency, which, in turn, lead tolower financing costs and make portfolioyields less volatile. At least for industrial coun-tries, a strategy which is specifically conceivedfor financial market players and instrumentswould therefore appear a more suitablemeans of ensuring the stability of the finan-cial system than general measures which limitmarket integration.
A prudent approach by financial market play-
ers depends on the availability of sufficient in-formation on business partners and marketconditions on the one hand and on maturerisk management on the other. The bestplace to start is the banks since they are ofprime importance in terms of the stability ofthe financial system. A relevant legal frame-work should also give the banks the incen-tives they need to carry out a thorough checkof their borrowers’ creditworthiness. In add-ition, it is important to take account of theinterdependence of specific risks, as these donot occur in isolation. Although it may be ne-cessary to extend the regulation to furthermarket participants in some circumstances,this extension should always focus on its rele-vance to the stability of the financial system.
A conscious approach to risk handling is also
dependent on the financial market playersbeing accountable for their own mistakes. Itcannot fall to public sector bodies at the na-

29The long-term
sustainabilityof public finance –an analysis basedon generationalaccountingIn the wake of the low birth rate and
rising life expectancy, the share ofolder people in the German popula-tion will grow strongly, especially fromthe middle of the next decade on-wards. Elder persons receive benefitsthat are largely financed by workinggenerations, particularly under thestatutory pension insurance scheme.Based on present benefit entitlements,this growing share of older people willpush up the government financing re-quirement in relation to GDP. The re-sulting long-term budgetary problemsare hardly captured at all by conven-tional fiscal indicators such as thebudget balance or the level of govern-ment debt. The following article there-fore employs the instrument of gen-erational accounting to analyse thetrend in the long-term sustainability ofpublic finance during recent years. Itreveals a “sustainability gap” whichhas not been closed by the measurestaken so far at the political level. Thegenerational accounting approach canalso be used to analyse shifts in therespective burden on different gener-ations resulting from changes in taxand transfer legislation. This is illus-trated by the example of the pensionreform 2001.

30The concept of generational accounting1
Conventional indicators of fiscal policy such
as current deficits and government debt saylittle about the long-term sustainability ofpublic finance, particularly when society isundergoing a demographic change. Thesame applies to the scale of the interge-nerational redistribution of burdens broughtabout by government activity. As convention-al indicators take little or no account of futurepayment commitments of the state, the sus-tainability and intergenerational redistributionmay change owing to fiscal and social policymeasures or other factors even if the deficitratio is kept constant. For example, the intro-duction of additional benefits under thestatutory nursing insurance scheme has hadhardly any impact on the current fiscal bal-ance because this new government expend-iture is being financed by additional contribu-tion receipts. This expansion of governmenttransfers nevertheless entails a shift in the re-spective burden to be borne by people bornin different years (cohorts) as the expenditureof this new social security scheme primarilybenefits today’s older individuals who, how-ever, are scarcely involved in financing it. Thelevel of government debt is likewise not avery suitable indicator of real long-term bur-dens since it solely comprises explicit debt butnot implicit liabilities – such as future claimson the statutory pension insurance scheme.
Owing to these shortcomings of conventional
fiscal policy yardsticks, the technique of gen-erational accounting was developed in theearly 1990s.
2The basic idea of this concept
consists in combining the fiscal conditions ofa base year with the likely evolution of the
population. This fiscal status quo is represent-ed by the average payment streams observedin the base year between the state andpeople born in individual years. The startingpoint of generational accounting is the re-quirement that all future government ex-penditure must be covered by future revenue(the intertemporal budget constraint on thestate). Put another way, the present value ofgovernment revenue must equal the presentvalue of its expenditure (excluding interestpayments) plus the government debt.
The first step in the generational accounting
approach is to examine how the various cat-egories of government revenue and expend-iture are distributed across individual birth-years. For example, the average level of socialsecurity contributions paid by a 30 year-oldperson or the amount of social assistancebenefits received by a 40 year-old is com-puted. Government revenue or expenditurewhich cannot be readily assigned to individual

31cohorts is distributed in this study evenly
across the general population.3
In a second step these age-specific amountsare extrapolated forward based on the as-sumption that the values computed in thebase year will continue to hold in the futurefor people of the same age. They are in-creased annually by the rate of productivitygrowth in order to take account of technicalprogress and concurrently discounted to thebase year of the study. It is then possible tocompute in a third step the expected averagepresent value of the net payments to thestate from an individual of a given age overhis/her remaining lifetime, i.e. tax and socialsecurity contributions less benefits receivedfrom the state. From this net position vis-à-visthe state (the “generational account”) it ispossible to tell to what extent individual agecategories will be financially affected by gov-ernment activity – positively or negatively – intheir remaining life span.
Finally, the amount of resources available to
the state for debt servicing can be calculatedby aggregating the generational accounts ofall living and future residents. If this aggre-gate total does not suffice to service the gov-ernment debt, the intertemporal budget con-straint shows a financing shortfall which isalso known as the sustainability gap. This de-notes the present value of the fiscal consoli-dation requirement, i.e. the amount thatneeds to be generated from future govern-ment revenue increases or expenditure cuts.The absolute level of the sustainability gap isnot all that meaningful, however, in that thegovernment’s ability to achieve the necessaryconsolidation partly depends on the country’s
future economic potential. In this study thesustainability gap is therefore related to thepresent value of future GDP .
4This yields the
percentage of GDP that must be covered im-mediately and for each future year by meansof government revenue increases or expend-iture decreases (referred to in the following asthe annual consolidation requirement).
In the basic version (“status quo scenario”) it
is assumed that the fiscal conditions obtain-ing in the base year will continue to prevail inthe future. Under this scenario the real needfor fiscal policy action may differ from the an-nual consolidation requirement for variousreasons. Thus measures may already havebeen agreed which will take (full) effect onlyin future years. For example, the further stepsin the tax reform agreed last year will lead tosubstantial additional tax revenue shortfalls inthe coming years. Moreover, the consolida-tion requirement may also be affected by“cohort effects” that are not directly relatedto government measures. Thus the level ofnew and future pensions of women is consid-erably higher than the benefits currently re-ceived by female pensioners, partly becausethe participation rate of women born in lateryears tends to be higher than that of womenborn in earlier years. To be able to better as-

cording to age chiefly comprises spending on national
and international security, public administration and gov-
ernment investment. The main corresponding items on
the revenue side are government sales, especially fee in-
come.
4This is computed by distributing the GDP of the base
year across the various age categories based on the age
profile of employee compensation. These age-specific per
capita variables are extrapolated in line with the product-
ivity growth rate and aggregated on the basis of the

32sess the remaining need for action, therefore,
the simple extrapolation of the age-specificpayment profiles in the status quo scenario issupplemented in this study by a “policy scen-ario”. The policy scenario captures both theeffects of major measures already agreed butwhich will take effect only in the future andthe aforementioned cohort effect.
It should be pointed out that the policy scen-
ario likewise makes no allowance for the factthat the sustainability gap thus calculateddoes not necessarily have to be closed exclu-sively through additional government meas-ures; future changes in other factors whichaffect the age-specific payment profiles mayalso play a role. For instance, a rising labourforce participation rate might mean higherper capita tax payments and social securitycontributions in future than in the base year.To the extent that the sustainability gap ismodified by such factors, the annual consoli-dation requirement as computed under thepolicy scenario is thus likewise not identical tothe remaining real need for action.
Limitations of generational accounting
To avoid misinterpreting the empirical results,
some important conceptual qualifications arenecessary in respect of generational account-ing. The simple extrapolation of the age-specific payment profiles in line with the rateof productivity growth shows that gener-ational accounting is not a forecasting tool.Under the policy scenario, as under the statusquo scenario, no attempt is made to predictthe expected development based on presentlegislation. For example, the current legal re-
gime prohibits credit financing by the mainsocial security schemes. Instead, revenuelevels are automatically aligned with the evo-lution of expenditure by adjusting the contri-bution rates. By definition, therefore, no sus-tainability gap can arise in these key fields ofpublic finance. For this reason constant con-tribution rates are assumed in our study sothat the future growing contribution burdencan be captured. The average tax burden islikewise kept constant, with the result thatadditional receipts generated by the progres-sive nature of the tax scale are disregarded.
Changes in the macroeconomic setting re-
sulting from demographic developments orreactions to political measures are likewise ig-nored. Moreover, it is generally assumed thatno levies or transfers are passed on but that,rather, taxes and social security contributionsburden the people who pay them and trans-fers benefit the people who receive them.
5
Trying to estimate the macroeconomic reper-cussions and the incidence of governmentmeasures would not only be a very oneroustask, it would have the added disadvantagethat the results would be harder to interpretas a result of the required additional assump-tions.
A further point to bear in mind is that ex-
trapolating the age-specific payment profilescalculated for the base year projects all excep-tional factors which applied in that year into

33the future. Cyclical influences on public fi-
nance and other temporary factors maytherefore distort the outcome of generationalaccounting and may lead to considerablefluctuations in the consolidation requirementfrom year to year which are not due to thebasic orientation of fiscal policy. This objec-tion is met in this case by adjusting the pay-ment profiles observed in each base year forcyclical factors. Other major influences whichcan clearly be identified as temporary effectsare likewise not extrapolated into the future(such as the proceeds from the sale of theUMTS mobile phone licences in 2000). Withregard to the persisting differences betweenwestern Germany and eastern Germany, it isassumed that the age-specific payment pro-files of the various categories of levies andtransfers in eastern Germany will match thelevel in western Germany by 2020.
It should further be remembered that, in par-
ticular, the derivation of separate age-specificpayment profiles for different sections of thepopulation and the calculation of the effectsof policy changes which have been agreedbut which will come into effect only at a fu-ture date entail many estimates. Similarly, thetask of gauging the distribution of the indi-vidual government revenue and expenditurecomponents across the age groups largely re-lies on sampling. Consequently, the computa-tion results are subject to considerable mar-gins of uncertainty.Underlying assumptions
The calculations under the generational ac-
counting approach necessitate assumptionsabout future population developments, thediscounting factor and the rate of productiv-ity growth. The forecast for the demographictrend up to 2050 is largely based on the as-sumptions of variant 1 of the ninth coordin-ated population forecast for Germany.
6Ac-
cording to that projection, the overall birthrate will remain steady at around 1.4 childrenper woman, the long-term annual migrationsurplus will amount to 100,000 people andlife expectancy will increase by approximatelyfour years by 2050. No further increase is as-sumed for the subsequent years. The com-bined result of these developments is an ac-celerated decrease in the total populationfrom 82 million at the beginning of 1999 to65 million by 2050. This contraction will beaccompanied by a growing ageing of thepopulation. The dependency ratio, definedhere as the ratio of the number of peopleaged 60 or more to the number of peopleaged between 20 and 59, will double by themiddle of the century to around 80% andwill decrease only slightly thereafter.
The discounting rate and the productivity
growth rate were set at the respective aver-age values over the past decades for the realinterest rate (4%) and real per capita incomegrowth (2%).

34The age-related burden resulting from
government activity
As shown in the chart above, the individual
burden caused by government activity variessignificantly with age.
7Children and young
people receive considerable benefits from thestate in the form of child benefit and educa-tion but contribute little or nothing towardsfinancing them.
8Once they enter working
life, their tax payments and social securitycontributions increase sharply, with the resultthat net payments to the state become posi-tive. During their working life, levy paymentsclosely follow the pattern of income. Whenthey retire at around 60, transfers from thestate – which are comparatively constantuntil then – shoot up, whereas payments tothe state drop significantly. Consequently, thestate becomes a net payer again. Above all,
the rising transfers from the statutory nursingand health insurance schemes as residual lifeexpectancy decreases means that the govern-ment’s net payments increase continuouslywith old age.
From this age profile of the net payments to
the state the generational accounts of thevarious age cohorts can be calculated as ex-plained above. Keeping the same fiscal condi-tions which prevailed in 2000 and taking ac-count of measures which have already beenagreed but which will not come into effectuntil a future date, newly born individualswould receive on average marginally morebenefits from the state during the course oftheir life than they contribute to it (see charton page 35). Their generational accounts areparticularly informative as theirs is the soleage cohort that reflects levies to and transfersfrom government over their entire life span.As the generational accounts of all other agecohorts only give the net position for their re-maining lifetime, they are not directly com-parable with one another.

7The results given in this article are not directly compar-
able with those presented in the 1997 Monthly Report
owing to a number of methodological changes and the
more recent data base used. In particular, in 1997 gov-
ernment expenditure items which could not be directly
attributed by age were not distributed across the popu-
lation, no convergence of eastern Germany towards
west German levels was assumed, government fixed
assets were treated differently and a different population
development was forecast.
8The age-specific payment profiles for the individual levy
and transfer types were taken predominantly from the
1998 sample survey of income and consumption, the
socio-economic panel advised by the German Institute
for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin and statistics pro-
vided by the statutory social security schemes. It was en-
sured that the payment profiles are consistent with the

35Evolution of the sustainability of public
finance since 1996
Under the status quo scenario and without
adjusting for cyclical and other temporary ef-fects, there was still a high annual consolida-tion requirement of 6.1% of GDP in 1996(see table on page 36). It decreased continu-ously and fairly steadily to 3.5% by 1999 andthen dropped sharply in 2000 to only 0.3%.However, that change was predominantlydue to including in the extrapolation the one-off proceeds from auctioning the UMTS mo-bile phone licences. Disregarding this excep-tional factor, the annual consolidation re-quirement would have declined less sharplyvis-à-vis the previous year.
Cyclical and other temporary effects have
had only a limited influence on public financesince 1996.
9They had a strong impact solely
in 2000, when they amounted to 2.4% ofGDP . Even so, the adjusted figures give asomewhat different picture over time thanthe unadjusted development. Instead of afairly steady decrease, the adjusted pathshows a steep fall in the annual consolidationrequirement (by almost 1
12percentage
points) in 1997, in the wake of very tightgovernment spending, with moderate de-clines subsequently.
A very different picture is obtained if the ef-
fects of measures which have already beenagreed but have not yet (fully) entered intoforce are included in the calculations. In 1996the annual consolidation requirement was al-ready 0.9 percentage point lower under thispolicy scenario than under the adjusted statusquo scenario. This was mainly due to the fu-
ture lowering of pension payments in connec-tion with early retirement announced in theGrowth and Employment Promotion Act. Theconsequences of this change far outweighthe rising pension payments for womencaused by the aforementioned cohort effect.In the following years the difference betweenthe respective annual consolidation require-ment under the two scenarios widened fur-ther, chiefly because of additional benefitcurbs in the statutory pension insuranceschemes due to come into effect at a laterdate.

policy scenario and the adjusted status quoscenario narrowed again.
Looking at the impact on the annual consoli-
dation requirement since 1996 of measureswhich will have an impact only at a futuredate, relief amounting to 0.3 percentagepoint vis-à-vis the adjusted status quo scen-ario arose in 1997 from interventions outsidethe statutory pension insurance scheme. Taxrelief, stemming mainly from the lowering ofthe solidarity surcharge from 7.5% to 5.5%on 1 January 1998, was more than offset byadditional revenue from raising turnover taxby 1 percentage point on 1 April 1998 and bya future drop in expenditure following thecoal subsidy compromise.
10Of far greater im-
portance were the economising measures inthe pension insurance schemes, the scope of
which was expanded significantly in the Pen-sion Reform Act 1999 which was adopted atthe end of 1997. The introduction of thedemographic factor would on its own havecut the annual consolidation requirement byaround 0.8 percentage point. In addition, theabolition from 2013 of the option of takingearly retirement before 62 years of age led toa further improvement in the sustainability ofpublic finance owing to non-actuarial deduc-tions. Compared with 1996, the overall reliefafforded by legislated measures taking effectin the future increased significantly.

37cantly vis-à-vis 1996 owing to tight budget
management, the annual consolidation re-quirement under the policy scenario de-creased by 2
12percentage points.
In 1998 enacted future measures (excluding
benefit reductions in the statutory pension in-surance scheme) taken into account in thepolicy scenario did not change the annualconsolidation requirement on balance vis-à-vis the adjusted status quo scenario. At theend of that year measures were adoptedwhich led to significant additional burdens ongovernment. These comprised the increase inchild benefit and the lowering of the bottomrate of income tax from the start of 1999introduced in the 1999 Tax Relief Act and thedecrease in the contribution rate to the statu-tory pension insurance scheme from 20.3%to 19.5% from 1 April 1999. However, thesesteps were offset by the fact that the rise inturnover tax in 1998 did not have a full im-pact in that year, so that the policy scenariofor 1998 contains additional receipts com-pared with the status quo scenario. Furtherrelief was provided by the future reductionsin subsidies to the coal industry. The relieffrom measures taking effect in the futuredeclined somewhat compared with 1997 alsoafter including benefits payable under thestatutory pension insurance funds. Conse-quently, only a slight improvement was re-corded in the policy scenario vis-à-vis 1997,whereas the annual consolidation require-ment under the adjusted status quo scenariofell by
12percentage point.
In 1999 (including the political measures out-
side the statutory pension insurance schemeadopted up to the end of the year), the annual
consolidation requirement narrowed by 0.6percentage point vis-à-vis the adjusted statusquo scenario. The main reasons for this werethe graduated increase in mineral oil tax andthe (new) electricity tax introduced with theecological tax reform.
11This was only partly
offset by several cuts in levies (primarily intro-duced by the 1999/2000/2001 Tax Relief Act)and a further increase in child benefit at thebeginning of 2000. In the statutory pension in-surance scheme further cuts were adopted bylimiting the increase in pension benefits in2 0 0 0a n d2 0 0 1t ot h ei n f l a t i o nr a t eo b t a i n i n gin the previous year.

While the annual con-solidation requirement under the adjusted sta-tus quo scenario decreased by 0.4 percentagepoint vis-à-vis 1998, there was a correspondingimprovement under the policy scenario of1.2 percentage points.
In 2000 the political changes due to come
into effect at a later date (excluding the curb-ing of benefits under the statutory pensioninsurance scheme) significantly worsened thesustainability of public finance vis-à-vis theadjusted status quo scenario. This was princi-pally due to the extensive tax relief measuresadopted under the tax reform. Thus the TaxReduction Act – which comprised corporatetax reforms, the bringing forward of the thirdstage of the Tax Relief Act to 2001 and fur-ther income tax cuts in two stages up to

falls of DM 63 billion in the final year. The re-duction of the contribution rate to the statu-tory pension insurance scheme by 0.2 per-centage point as of 1 January 2001 was of farless importance.
12The impact of the meas-
ures on the benefits side of the statutory pen-sion insurance scheme remained almost un-changed in comparison with the previousyear. In total, the policy changes due to enterinto force at a later time brought far less reliefthan in 1999. Although the annual consolida-tion requirement under the adjusted statusquo scenario fell by 1 percentage point vis-à-vis 1999, it increased under the policy scen-ario from 1.2% to 2.1% of GDP .
In themselves, the extensive tax cuts should
improve the conditions for growth. At thesame time, they constitute an ongoing bur-
den for the sustainability of public finance be-cause (at least until now) they are being onlypartly counterfinanced by corresponding sav-ings in government expenditure.
13
Using the results for 2000, it is possible topinpoint the factors that are responsible forthe consolidation requirement. Had there notbeen a cumulative gross public debt ofDM 2.4 trillion at the end of 1999, the annualconsolidation requirement under the policyscenario would have been only 0.7% of GDPinstead of 2.1%. The fiscal differences stillexisting between eastern and western Ger-many in 2000 likewise accounted for a signifi-cant part of the large adjustment require-ment. If the convergence process in easternGermany had already been completed by2000, the consolidation requirement wouldhave been only 1.2% of GDP . However,demographic ageing had by far the greatestinfluence. If the age structure of the popula-tion could be kept constant, a significant sur-plus position would actually be achieved.
The sensitivity of the results to changes in the
underlying economic assumptions can alsobe illustrated by the policy scenario figuresfor 2000. In this connection the assumedperiod of time until the completion of theintra-German convergence process has thegreatest weight (see box on page 40). The an-Annual consolidation requirement

The pension reform 2001 in the light of
generational accounting
At the beginning of this year a pension re-
form was adopted the centrepiece of which isthe complementation of the current pay-as-you-go system by a private, funded compon-ent.
14How far the annual consolidation re-
quirement at the end of 2000 has beenchanged on balance by this reform dependson many different measures in various areaswhich in some cases apply only at a laterjuncture or to specific cohorts (e.g. new rulesgoverning disability pensions, greater off-setting of surviving dependants’ pensionsagainst other income or the change in thepension scheme after 2010). Solely the impli-cations for pension adjustments of the no-tional contributions to supplementary privatepension plans and the tax revenue shortfallscaused by government promotion measuresare taken into account here.
15
The savings expected from curbing the an-nual pension adjustment between 2003 and2010 will reduce the annual consolidation re-quirement by 0.6 percentage point. However,this improvement in the long-term sustain-ability of public finance will be considerablydampened by the government promotion ofsupplementary private pension plans adopted
with the Act Promoting Private Pension Plans.If the official estimates of the tax revenueshortfalls resulting from government grantsor the tax deductibility of private pensioncontributions are extrapolated into the fu-ture, the consolidation requirement increasesby around 0.4 percentage point.
16On bal-
ance, therefore, the aforementioned meas-ures improve the sustainability of public fi-nance only marginally. If it is further takeninto account that, in accordance with the le-gislation approved at the end of 2000, thedemographic factor would have come intoeffect in 2002 but that this measure has beenannulled, the annual consolidation require-ment actually increases vis-à-vis the policyscenario excluding the components of thepension reform taken into account here.
Using generational accounting, it is also pos-
sible to estimate the intergenerational redistri-bution effects of the introduction of supple-mentary private pension plans as part of the2001 pension reform. These can be computedfrom the difference between the generationalaccounts of the individual age cohorts underthe reference scenario (policy scenario in 2000excluding the demographic factor) and thescenario taking account of the measures. Thechart on page 41 shows that the curbing of

40Deutsche BundesbankThe importance of the intra-German convergence process
1The derivation of separate age-specific payment profiles
for eastern and western Germany can only be
approximated because the national accounts do not showa regional breakdown of the overall German government
balance.In 2000 the respective economic conditions in
eastern and western Germany still differed
considerably. Average GDP per inhabitant in
eastern Germany was barely two-thirds of the
level in western Germany. At the same time the
unemployment rate, at 17.4 %, was more than
double the figure in the West. This economic gap
is also reflected in individuals’ financial relationswith government because the smaller economic
capacity in the East means lower tax payments
and social security contributions, on the one hand,
and higher government transfers, on the other.
The age-specific net payments of east Germans in
2000 therefore differed markedly from those of
west Germans (see chart).
 1
Although these net payments are still relatively
similar in the case of children and young people,
the net amount that individuals pay during their
working life is noticeably lower in eastern
Germany than in western Germany. This is chiefly due to the lower tax payments and social security
contributions resulting from a lower per capita
income level. Income tax payments have a
particular impact in this connection because the
progressive tax scale means that lower income
earners pay disproportionately less income tax.
Social security contributions vary less between
eastern and western Germany becausecontributions are largely paid on a proportionate
basis and also because the participation rate in
the labour force of east German women is higher
than that of their west German counterparts.
Government transfers per person of working age
are higher in eastern Germany than in western
Germany owing to higher labour market-related
transfers. After retirement, which on average
begins around two years earlier for east Germans
than for west Germans, government transfers per
person and year are approximately equal in both
regions. The reason why the net benefit for west
Germans in these age brackets is somewhat lower
is because they pay higher levies. 
The assumed period of time required for the
age-specific payment profiles in eastern Germany
to match the west German level has a decisive
influence on the results. In the basic variant,
convergence is assumed by 2020. If the period of
time assumed up to intra-German convergence
were ten years longer (shorter), the annual
consolidation requirement would increase
(decrease) by around 0.4 percentage point. If no
further convergence were to occur (which is very
unlikely, however), the annual consolidation
requirement would amount to no less than 4.9 %of GDP and be thus almost 3 percentage points
higher than under the policy scenario based on
convergence by 2020. The rising net tax payments
of east Germans in the future projected under the
assumed convergence scenario therefore make a
significant contribution to financing the increase
in expenditure brought about by demographic
change.DM thousand per year and inhabitant

41pension adjustments by deducting the notional
contributions to supplementary private pensionplans particularly disadvantages the age co-horts who are already retired or who will retireshortly. The additional burden on people aged60 totals approximately DM 13,000 over theirremaining lifetime. By contrast, the burden tobe borne by younger cohorts is far smallerowing to the greater discounting. Governmentpromotion of supplementary private pensionplans will particularly benefit those cohortswho are at the start of their working life andwho can therefore claim this promotion over alonger period of time. Thus persons aged 20will make a net gain of around DM 9,000. Thisbenefit accruing from the government promo-tion measures then declines with the remainingduration until retirement. The combined effectof smaller pension adjustments and govern-ment promotion of supplementary private pen-sion plans places a substantial burden on exist-ing pensioners and pre-retirees, whereas theburden on younger cohorts is actually allevi-ated slightly. Thus the pension reform will con-tribute towards a more even intergenerationalredistribution of the demographic burdens.
Conclusion
Owing to its forward-looking perspective,
generational accounting is a better tool thantraditional fiscal indicators for analysing thelong-term sustainability of public sectorbudgets. In addition, it can provide pointersto the intergenerational redistribution effectsof political measures. However, its conceptuallimitations also need to be borne in mindwhen interpreting the results. In particular,the outcome must not be misinterpreted as a
forecast but rather should be understood asan indicator of the orientation of fiscal policyin the base year. Furthermore, the results aredependent on the underlying assumptionsconcerning the economic and demographicconditions. This applies especially to the abso-lute level of the annual consolidation require-ment but less to its change from year to year.Finally, it should be remembered that thelimited data base – particularly regarding theimplications of measures adopted in the fu-ture – necessitates the extensive use of esti-mations. Hence the results are subject to con-siderable uncertainty.
Despite these limitations, the results show
that in 2000 Germany was still a long wayfrom achieving a sustainable public finance

42position. Of course, it needs to be borne in
mind that the possible positive consequencesof the tax reform on macroeconomic growthhave not been taken into consideration andthat the annual consolidation requirementdoes not have to be covered exclusively bypolitical measures but, rather, a contributionmay also be made by other factors such as arising participation rate. Nevertheless, the re-sults clearly show that at present there is noscope for deficit-raising additional tax cuts or
improved benefits. In its recently publishednew Stability Programme, the German Fed-eral Government in principle reaffirmed theobjective of eliminating the general govern-ment fiscal deficit by 2004, despite the rev-enue losses ensuing from the tax reform. Ifthis can be accomplished, Germany will moveappreciably closer to the goal of a sustainablepublic finance position.
Annex
Calculating the sustainability gap
Under the intertemporal budget constraint on the
state, government net debt ND has to be financedby future net payments from individuals to thestate, as recorded in the generational accounts. Ifthe present value of all generational accounts doesnot suffice to meet this budget constraint (given acontinuation of the current fiscal conditions), thepresent value of the required additional revenue orreduced expenditure is indicated by the sustainabil-ity gap TF. If the sum of the generational accountsis subdivided into the contributions made by thegenerations now living, those born in the futureand future immigrants, the intertemporal budgetconstraint may be represented as follows – takinginto account the size of the respective cohorts:

45German enterprises’
earning andfinancing patterns,by form of businessorganisationThis article presents, for the first time,
figures from the Bundesbank’s corpor-ate balance-sheet statistics extrapo-lated by form of business organisation.In addition, the area covered, whichhas hitherto been confined to westernGermany, is extended to encompassthe whole of the Federal Republic.
Judging by the findings of the data
evaluations, enterprises in industry,trade and transportation on averagesubstantially enhanced their grossearnings between 1994 and 1999.The profit-turnover ratio rose from2
12% to almost 312%. That enabled
those firms to bolster their financialstrength. The stock of own funds grewsignificantly, and the return on equitywent up by one percentage point, to17
12%, in 1999. However, the general-
ly favourable development of earningswas mainly due to corporations. Theother forms of business organisationwere unable to keep pace with them,inter alia because they were less able
than corporations to offset the slug-gish growth of the domestic marketsby recourse to exports. Among soleproprietorships, the capital ratio de-teriorated further. Altogether, thenot-very-robust financial situation ofunincorporated enterprises impliesmassive structural differences in theenterprise sector.

46Movements in earnings, by form
of business organisation
Between 1994 and 1999, enterprises’ earn-
ings (which differ, not least for methodologic-al reasons, from the business profits of thenational accounts
1) rose strongly in the eco-
nomic sectors analysed. The annual result be-fore taxes on profits
2increased altogether by
an average of 712% a year. In this connec-
tion, it must be borne in mind that enter-prises’ gross profits picked up noticeably in1994, on account of the general economicupswing, from their low recessionary level in1993. In the ensuing years, however, move-ments in earnings were highly volatile. Be-tween 1994 and 1996, they fell by 1%. In1997 and 1998, they rose at double-digitrates. In 1999, by contrast, they tended toslacken somewhat again. The main reasonfor the decline in earnings towards themiddle of the nineties was that the Germaneconomy moved away from its expansionarycourse in the second half of 1995, and didnot resume it until the spring of 1996. Thatowed much to the strong appreciation of theDeutsche Mark in 1995, which exercised adampening effect on foreign demand forGerman industrial goods. Moreover, the com-paratively steep wage rises in the 1995 wageround probably likewise contributed to thedrop in corporate earnings.
In the course of 1996, the improvement in
overall economic conditions for enterprises(which was reflected inter alia in the calmingof the foreign exchange markets, more fa-vourable financing conditions and more mod-erate wage settlements) emerged more andmore clearly. That improvement was mirrored
very auspiciously in 1997 in enterprises’ profitDM

47and loss accounts. The gross result for the
year rose by 3012% over the depressed 1996
figure. That out-turn was again surpassedperceptibly (viz. by 15%) in the 1998 finan-cial year. In the second half of that year, how-ever – as a result of crises emanating fromeastern Asia – substantial turmoil arose in theinternational financial markets, which de-pressed global economic conditions, and in-creasingly affected the German economyas well. Those dampening influences fromabroad slackened again in the course of1999, but they left a distinct mark on enter-prises’ annual results. Before taxes on profits,such results declined by 2%. The brighteningof global economic conditions was notreflected in profit and loss accounts until thefinancial year 2000, a detailed account ofwhich cannot be given here, however, be-cause sufficient data are not available.
Over the whole period from 1994 to 1999,
the average annual growth rate of net profits,at 7%, was not quite as fast as that of grossearnings. However, the level (and possiblyalso the movement) of the after-tax annualresult is distorted by the fact that earnings-tax costs comprise (besides trade-earningstax) only the profits taxes paid by corpor-ations. By contrast, the annual results of part-nerships and sole proprietorships are taxed inthose enterprises’ private sphere, i.e. the cor-responding tax liability does not appear inthose firms’ profit and loss accounts. But theensuing analysis of after-tax profits, which isperformed for the first time for individualforms of business organisation in the contextof the present study, is certainly informativefor corporations alone. (See the annex begin-ning on page 60 for methodological notes on
the extrapolation by form of business organ-isation.)
The steep rise in the profits of industrial en-
terprises between 1994 and 1999 must beseen against the backdrop of the expansionof business activity in the interim.
3The gross
profit-turnover ratio, which denotes the ratioof the annual result before taxes on profits tofirms’ turnover, stood at 2
12% in 1994.
Compared with the nadir in 1993, when ithad stood at 2%, according to earlier com-putations, this is to be rated as a return tonormal. In the ensuing period up to 1998, itrose further to 3
12%, and then fell some-
what in 1999. Most recently, however, thatearning ratio still stood at the level of theboom year 1991.
Of the economic sectors analysed, the manu-
facturing sector, the energy and water-supplysector and the transportation sector improvedtheir earnings at an above-average rate dur-ing the period under review from 1994 to1999. In the industrial core of the Germaneconomy, the gross profit-turnover ratio wentup by one percentage point to 4%. This risein profits owed much to the fact that labourcosts increased more slowly than overall out-put. That is due partly to the increasing ten-dency towards “leaner” production, for in-stance by outsourcing certain operations, andpartly to heavy shedding of personnel onaccount of rationalisation measures in themid-nineties. The generally moderate wage-rate policies pursued in the second half of the

Moreover, spending on depreciation rose onlya little, and interest paid decreased markedly.

1994 to 1112% in 1999). It is striking that
this increase took place in an environment ofselling prices that were tending to go down.Behind these developments were sharply fall-ing prices of fossil energy sources, whichwere passed on to customers at least in part,along with increased competitive pressure inrecent years, as a result of the deregulation ofthe electricity market. But the public utilitiesenjoyed relief on the cost side not only interms of the costs of materials, but also in
terms of labour costs and expenditure on de-preciation and interest. Enterprises in thetransportation sector – starting from a verylow level in 1994 – had increased their grossannual result by 450% in 1998, but had toaccept a decline of almost one-fifth in 1999.Most recently, the profit-turnover ratio, at2
12%, has been distinctly above its starting
point (of about 1%) in 1994.
The wholesale and retail trade recorded com-
paratively small increases in the annual resultbefore taxes on profits. In terms of theamount, gross profits in 1999 were only2
12% and 9%, respectively, higher than in
1994. In both segments of trade, the profit-turnover ratio declined slightly during thatperiod, viz. to barely 2% in each case. TheseEnterprises’ profit-turnover ratios, by form of organisation and economic sector,

49ratios are indicative of rather tight profitabil-
ity, even if it has to be borne in mind that thevalue added in trade – relative to turnover – iscomparatively low, or (put differently) thattotal output is inflated by the large proportionof merchandise receipts, compared for in-stance with the same variable in the manu-facturing sector. The below-average growthof earnings among firms in the wholesale sec-tor is mainly due to the fact that materialscosts, including the merchandise input, in-creased somewhat faster than total output.The sluggish rise in profits in the retail trade isattributable not least to keen competition be-tween the major trading groups, which mark-edly squeezed profit margins at times. More-over, owing to shifts in consumption patterns,retail turnover has not been able for quitesome time to keep pace with the growth ofprivate consumption.
By far the worst earnings performance was
registered by the construction sector, whosegross profits slumped between 1994 and1999. Relative to turnover, they went downfrom 2
12% to 1%. That reflects the struc-
tural adjustment in the German constructionsector, which began after the waning of thereunification boom and has lasted right up tothe present year, and which has been accom-panied on the supplier side not only by a sub-stantial deterioration in earnings but also by adramatic reduction in capacities, especially ineastern Germany. As measured by the realgross value added, the output of the con-struction sector in 1999 was one-tenth belowthe level of 1994, while employment de-creased by 14% in those five years.Thus the spread of profit-turnover ratios in
1999 ranged from about 1% in constructionto as much as 11
12% in energy and water
supply. However, that reflects not only differ-ences in the profitability of firms in the vari-ous sectors but also marked differentials incapitalisation. An enterprise with a high cap-ital-labour ratio, such as is typical of theenergy and water-supply sector, has to gener-ate a higher profit-turnover ratio than, say, afirm in the construction sector, with its rela-tively labour-intensive production, in order toachieve a comparable return on equity, orreturn on total capital employed. The samething tends to apply to enterprises in, for in-stance, the manufacturing sector, comparedwith trading firms with a large ratio ofbought-in materials and services to turnover.Differences in the taxation of earnings maylikewise affect the structural picture. More-over, diverging operative and financial riskssometimes play a role.
4That goes to show
that the gross profit-turnover ratio is only oflimited value as a yardstick of multisectoralcomparisons of corporate profitability, and isin need of supplementary indicators. But itcontinues to be of use in analyses coveringspecific periods, provided that it can be as-sumed that the sectoral composition and theinput ratio are relatively stable, and in thecomparative analysis of trends between thevarious sectors.
At first glance, the problems outlined
with regard to the interpretation of theprofit-turnover ratio seem to make it appearpreferable to focus attention more on other

50financial operating variables, such as the re-
turn on equity, or the return on total capitalemployed.
5However, problems are posed by
the fact that the balance-sheet figures onshareholders’ equity (and thus ultimately ontotal capital) are historic book values ofassets, which are often well below the marketvalues, whereas the profits are shown at cur-rent prices. In addition, the balance sheets ofunincorporated enterprises, especially thoseof sole proprietorships, show only part of theliable assets of the proprietor – a circum-stance which will be addressed in more detailbelow. Hence the return on shareholders’equity and the return on total capital em-ployed, as calculated on the basis of balance-sheet data, are distorted distinctly upwards inpart, and fail to provide a faithful picture ofprofitability in the enterprise sector.
In terms of the form of business organisation,
corporations recorded by far the largest in-creases in earnings. During the period underreview, from 1994 to 1999, their pre-tax an-nual result almost doubled. By contrast,partnerships and sole proprietorships regis-tered rises of “only” 12
12% and 1012%, re-
spectively. The differences in profitability arebrought out even more impressively if it iskept in mind that corporations generated84
12% of the entire growth of profits,
whereas partnerships accounted for 1012%
and sole proprietorships for only 5%. How-ever, these differences are reflected only inpart in profit-turnover ratios because businessactivity among corporations and partnershipsexpanded equally (by one-sixth), whereas itdecreased slightly among sole proprietor-ships. Furthermore, account must be taken ofthe divergent starting positions. Before taxes
on earnings, corporations’ profit-turnoverratio increased by a good percentage point to3% in 1999. That was almost equal to thelevel among partnerships, which, however,had to accept a slight decline over the entireperiod under review. Among sole proprietor-ships, the earnings ratio rose by one-half of apercentage point to just over 4
12%.
The sluggish growth of the profits of partner-
ships and sole proprietorships contrasts withthe consistently high level of profit-turnoverratios. But it must be kept in mind in this con-nection that proprietors’ income, i.e. theirremuneration for the entrepreneur’s input, isincluded in the gross profits shown amongunincorporated enterprises, whereas the sal-aries of managers or top executives are in-cluded in labour costs among corporationsand thus, viewed in isolation, reduce theprofit for the year. Rough calculations showthat the profit situation of unincorporated en-terprises, after the deduction of an imputedproprietors’ income, is distinctly worse thanthat of corporations. Particularly among soleproprietorships, the profits shown are oftennearly “swallowed up” by the proprietors’ in-come.
The relatively unfavourable trends in earn-
ings among unincorporated enterprises owesomething to the fact that enterprises of thisform of business organisation in trade andconstruction, which had recorded only

52below-average increases in profits, or which
had to contend with the erosion of their prof-itability during the second half of the nineties,carry greater weight than, for instance, in in-dustry. Thus, according to the official turn-over-tax statistics, in 1999 unincorporatedenterprises liable to turnover tax generated55
12% of turnover in the construction sector,
and 5012% in the wholesale and retail trade,
compared with 34% in the manufacturingsector and only 10
12% in energy and water
supply, which registered particularly steepincreases in profits during the period underreview.
But the uneven sectoral distribution of the
individual forms of business organisation ac-counts for only part of the differences inprofits. Except in construction and the retailtrade, corporations in the individual economicsectors recorded greater increases in profitsthan did partnerships and sole proprietor-ships. A contributory factor here may havebeen that, in the nineties, corporations,which are normally backed by comparativelylarge corporate entities, were better ablethan smaller firms to take advantage of ra-tionalisation potentials and to curb the rise incosts. Presumably they were likewise able toexploit more intensively the greater flexibilityin working hours agreed in wage settlements,and to take advantage of international link-ages in production more effectively thansmaller firms. Moreover, larger enterprises,which are usually relatively heavily engaged inexporting, benefited from the fact that for-eign demand expanded much more stronglythan domestic demand in the second half ofthe nineties. For instance, foreign turnover inthe manufacturing sector (including mining),
according to the official statistics, went up by47% between 1994 and 1999, comparedwith a rise of only 9% in domestic turnover.
As mentioned above, the after-tax profits of
corporations can be derived from the annualaccounts; they grew even faster during theperiod from 1994 to 1999 that those beforetax. This difference is primarily due to theyear 1997, in which the year-on-year rise inspending on taxes on income and earnings,at 27%, fell distinctly short of the growth ofgross profits (47
12%). Hence the net figure
shot up by no less than 70%. The main rea-son for the comparatively moderate increasein spending on profits tax may have been,first, that enterprises reduced to an evengreater extent losses carried forward fromearlier years of low profitability. Second, an-other significant factor was that corporationshad the option (for the last time) of releasing,with tax-reducing effect, revenue reservestaxed at the rate of 50% in force up to theend of 1993, and earmarking them for distri-bution in 1998.
6The net profit-turnover ratio
of corporations rose from just under 1% toover 1
12%, and thus – after taking due ac-
count of the lower starting value – fasterthan the corresponding gross variable.
6Tax relief for enterprises resulted from the fact that dis-
tributed profits were at that time liable to a corporation-
tax rate of only 30%, compared with 36% up to the end
of 1993. The reduction in tax, amounting to 20 percent-
age points compared with the retained tax rate of 50%,
was offset or refunded to the enterprise. Many firms
took greater advantage of this arrangement only towards
the expiry of the deadline. The relief effect was confined
to the year of the “rundown” of the revenue reserves
taxed at the rate of 50% (EK 50).The gross and

53Earnings and costs in detail
The total output of the enterprises in the eco-
nomic sectors examined, which variable in-cludes (besides turnover) changes in stocks ofinternally produced assets and other intern-ally produced and capitalised assets, in-creased during the period under review by13
12% or, as an annual average, by 212%.
The sluggish pace of business reflects notonly the weak macroeconomic growth duringthe period under review but also the com-paratively moderate rise in prices. For in-stance, the producer prices of industrial prod-ucts sold in the home market and construc-tion prices remained virtually stable between1994 and 1999. Inflation in the wholesaleand retail trades remained within strict limits.
The business activity of corporations and
partnerships continued to expand at virtuallythe same pace (by 15
12% and 1612%, re-
spectively), whereas it decreased marginally(– 1%) among sole proprietorships. This de-cline was broadly based, inasmuch as it af-fected not only the corresponding firms inthe construction sector but also those inthe wholesale trade and in manufacturing.Viewed as a whole, strong gearing to the do-mestic market seems to have been a majordeterminant for the predominantly small en-terprises operating in that form of businessorganisation. The aggregate earnings of in-dustrial enterprises, which include interestreceived and other income as well as totaloutput, expanded by 14
12%, and thus some-
what faster than business activity in the strict-er sense.Between 1994 and 1999, total costs rose by
14
14%, and thus only slightly less than earn-
ings; but this difference sufficed to make theannual result sky-rocket, as described above.Hence the growth profile of total costsamong the individual forms of business or-ganisation largely tallies with the earningsside, inasmuch as they went up among cor-porations and partnerships by 16% and16
12%, respectively, but declined marginally
among sole proprietorships. A similar pictureis presented by materials costs, which in-creased on average by 16% (and thus some-what more than total output), but tended todiminish among sole proprietorships. By con-trast, labour costs (+ 7%) and depreciation(+ 2
12%) grew less than business activity.

54costs actually declined among sole proprietor-
ships.
Enterprises’ profit and loss accounts were af-
forded relief by the fact that interest paiddropped by 6% over the entire period underreview among all forms of business organisa-tion. That was mainly because lower borrow-ing rates were charged to enterprises (in theshort and long-term fields). By contrast, thestock of interest-bearing liabilities expandedstrongly: in 1999, it was 24
12% higher than
five years before. As interest receipts dimin-ished only slightly, the net interest paid de-clined by 9
12%. It was corporations that
benefited most from that; on balance, theyhad to pay one-fifth less interest.
Between 1994 and 1999, enterprises’ spend-
ing on taxes rose by just over one-fifth, i.e.more strongly than total output. That owedmuch to the 60% increase in taxes onincome and earnings, which was mainlydue (as explained above) to the upturn incorporation-tax payments by corporations.The transfers of trade-earning tax by partner-ships and sole proprietorships went up by25% and 15%, respectively. In 1999, by con-trast, enterprises’ total spending on “othertaxes”, which include the taxes not depend-ent on earnings, was “only” 7
12% higher
than in 1994, not least because of the aboli-tion of property tax as from January 1, 1997,and of trade-capital tax as from the begin-ning of 1998.
After materials costs and labour costs, the
most important expenditure item is thecatch-all variable “other costs”, which en-compass, besides spending on rents and
leases, research and development costs, ex-penditure on advertising, and transfers tospecial reserves. Between 1994 and 1999,such costs expanded by 21
12%, i.e. faster
than business activity. As a consequence, theyhave increased in importance, to about 14%of total costs. That reflects inter alia shifts in
favour of obtaining services from outside.
Balance-sheet trends and major
balance-sheet ratios, by form of businessorganisation
The favourable overall trend in corporate
earnings between 1994 and 1999, accom-panied by a moderate expansion of businessactivity, was reflected in the balance-sheetpattern as well. In the aggregate, the adjust-ed balance-sheet total
7increased by 1812%;
that constitutes an average annual rise of3
12%. Among corporations and partner-
ships, the pace of growth was somewhatstronger, at 20
12% each, whereas the
balance-sheet total of sole proprietorshipshas recently been only 2
12% higher than in
1994. Hence the growth profile there is simi-lar to that of overall output in the individualforms of business organisation.
The trend in assets is marked by the fact that
non-financial assets went up distinctly moreslowly (+ 11%) than financial assets (+ 27%).Tangible fixed assets – the chief component

55of non-financial assets – recorded an even
lower growth rate, at 812%. The slowdown
in investment focused on the energy andwater-supply sector, whose capital stock in1999 (in terms of book values) was 6
12%
below that of 1994. That was mainly be-cause, on the one hand, a high standard ofsupply has now been reached in Germany, sothat little investment in the extension of cap-acity is required. On the other hand, the in-crease in competition as a result of the de-regulation of the electricity market has pre-sumably meant that the long-term return oncertain capital projects has been called intoquestion. In trade and in the construction sec-tor, stocks of tangible fixed assets rose com-paratively little, whereas they went up at anabove-average rate in the manufacturing andtransportation sectors.
The sluggish growth of tangible fixed assets
(+ 6%) in the aggregate balance sheet ofcorporations is largely due to the decline inthe corresponding item in the energy andwater-supply sector, in which that form ofbusiness organisation is manifestly dominant.Sole proprietorships came off even worse; in1999 their capital stock just managed to re-gain the level of 1994 (after having decreasedin the interim). However, those trends wereaccompanied by decidedly buoyant invest-ment activity by partnerships, which resultedin stocks of tangible fixed assets increasing byabout one-fifth. That expansion was fuelledby firms in the manufacturing sector, whichregistered a growth in investment of 22
12%,
and contributed over one-half of the increasein tangible fixed assets effected by firms ofthat form of organisation.Among the financial assets of industrial
enterprises, growth was driven primarily bythe strong expansion of participating inter-ests
8(+ 5612%) and investments (+ 47%).
Short and long-term debtors rose by aboutone-fifth each, whereas the stock of cashresources stagnated. The highly divergenttrends in major asset items led to a markedshift in the asset structure. The significance oftangible fixed assets and stocks has dimin-ished by 3
12percentage points since 1994, to
49%, while the importance of financialassets has grown correspondingly.
A particularly conspicuous feature is the fact
that the ratio of participating interests to thebalance-sheet total rose by three percentagepoints to 11
12%. That development was
driven mainly by corporations, which in-creased the weight of their participatinginterests from 12% in 1994 to 15
12%i n
1999. Analysed by sectors, corporations inthe manufacturing sector were clearly top ofthe table in 1999, with a 20% share of par-ticipating interests. Among partnerships inthe economic sectors analysed, the “ratio”went up by one percentage point to 5
12%,
whereas it remained as low as ever amongsole proprietorships, at 1%. The strong ex-pansion of participating interests among cor-porations is an indication of the fact that“external growth” is increasingly being seenas an alternative to investment in one’s ownenterprise. In many cases, this is being regard-ed as an efficient way of cementing, or evenenhancing, one’s market position.

57Enterprises financed the expansion of their
assets to a greater extent than before by in-creasing their own funds; such growth, whichtotalled 25
12% between 1994 and 1999,
was distinctly stronger than the rise in thebalance-sheet total. The relatively large trans-fers to liable capital caused the own fundsratio to expand from 16
12% in 1994 to
1712% in 1999. Behind that growth were,
however, some very divergent trends and fi-nancing conditions in the various sectors anddifferent forms of business organisation.
In the sectors transportation, manufacturing
and wholesale trade, equity capital wasstrongly increased, whereas it grew compara-tively little in the energy and water-supplysector, and actually declined in the retail tradeand in construction. A striking feature, in par-ticular, was the erosion of liable funds in theconstruction sector by no less than 58%, as aresult of the sustained structural crisis. Thesectoral differences in the equity-capital basepartly increased and partly diminished be-tween 1994 and 1999. Thus, the equity-capital ratio in the energy and water-supplysector, which has latterly stood at 26% (near-ly the same level as in 1994), is still at the topof the list. But its lead over the manufacturingsector, which has increased its equity capital,relative to the balance-sheet total, by almosttwo percentage points to 23
12%, has de-
creased distinctly. The wholesale trade andtransportation have likewise gained ground,by significantly increasing their equity-capitalratio to 15
12% in 1999. By contrast, in
the retail trade and construction, that ratioslipped to about 2% each. Hence the equity-capital base must be termed decidedly nar-
row in the two last-named economic sectors.
Between the various forms of business organ-
isation, the contrasts with respect to theequity-capital base – and, correspondingly, tothe liabilities – are even more pronounced.Corporations were able to improve theirequity-capital base (which was thoroughlysound back in 1994) to 24
12% of the bal-
ance-sheet total. Among partnerships, theratio was distinctly lower in 1999, at 11
12%;
even so, own funds have been expandingthere, too, faster than the balance-sheet totalsince 1994. By contrast, the provision of soleproprietorships with own capital has con-tinued to deteriorate severely. Already in1994, their valuable assets fell 4% short oftheir aggregate liabilities and provisions; in%Own funds as % of balance-sheet total

581999, the difference came to 10%. In all the
economic sectors analysed here (except theretail trade) sole proprietorships were affect-ed by such balance-sheet over-indebtedness.
However, the finding of the balance-sheet
over-indebtedness of sole proprietorships hasto be viewed against the backdrop that theirannual accounts fail to show all the assetswhich are actually available as liable capital.In many cases, it is for the proprietors to de-cide whether assets are to be assigned to theprivate or to the operative sphere. It con-tinues to be attractive for tax reasons, e.g.because of the more favourable treatment ofcapital gains, to hold financial assets and realproperty as part of one’s private assets. Atthe end of the day, however, the sole propri-etor is liable for his firm’s liabilities with hisoff-balance-sheet assets as well. Moreover,
parts of the private assets are often used ascollateral when raising credits. Conversely,because of the tax deductibility of debtorinterest rates, there are incentives for shiftingborrowing operations to the corporatesphere. These modes of behaviour mean thatthe balance sheet of a sole proprietorshipoften reveals very little about its actual finan-cial status. The same reservation, with certainqualifications, also applies to partnerships, inwhich at least some of the partners are liablefor debts with their private property.
Substantial divergences between the various
forms of business organisation are also evi-dent with respect to the composition ofthe liabilities. A striking feature here is themarked differential in provisions, which inTrends in own funds, by form of organisation and economic sector,

591999 accounted for 2412% of the balance-
sheet total among corporations, 1212%
among partnerships and only 4% amongsole proprietorships. The main reason for thatis the differing weight of provisions for pen-sions, which make up 11% of the balance-sheet total among corporations but, at theother end of the scale, account for only
12%
among sole proprietorships,. Against thatbackdrop, the financing conditions of corpor-ations appear in a more favourable light,since the funds concerned have the characterof equity capital, inasmuch as they are avail-able to the enterprise at long term, and with-out an interest-rate or withdrawal risk.
Viewed as a whole, enterprises in industry,
trade and transportation succeeded in appre-ciably improving both their profitability andtheir financing conditions between 1994 and
1999. However, the favourable trend in prof-itability was driven primarily by corporations,as the analysis on the basis of the Bundes-bank’s corporate balance-sheet statistics,classified (for the first time) by form of busi-ness organisation, shows. Partnerships andsole proprietorships were unable to keepup. Among sole proprietorships, moreover,balance-sheet over-indebtedness actually in-creased, although it must be borne in mindthat proprietors are liable for their firms’liabilities with their private property as well.The poorer performance of unincorporatedenterprises in the second half of the ninetiescertainly owes something to the fact thatthey were less able than corporations (whichare, as a rule, among the larger firms) to off-set the sluggish growth of domestic demandEnterprises’ provision with own funds, by form of organisation and economic sector,

Annex
Methodological notes on the extrapolation
by form of business organisation
By tradition, the Bundesbank’s analyses of the
profitability and financing patterns of industrialenterprises are based on what are known as “ex-trapolated figures”.
9The available data are ex-
trapolated with the aid of the turnover figuresfrom the Federal Statistical Office’s turnover-taxstatistics, in order to eliminate disturbances deriv-ing from the varying composition of the balance-sheet data from year to year, and from the custom-ary higher degree of coverage of larger enter-prises.
10The extrapolation for the analysis present-
ed here includes, besides the turnover-size cat-egory and economic sector, (for the first time) theform of business organisation as a third structuralfeature. The cornerstone of the approach remainsthe extrapolation, by size category, of individualeconomic sectors. In contrast to earlier analyses,however, those sectors are no longer directly ex-trapolated in their entirety, but rather, to beginwith, separately in three organisational groups:corporations, partnerships and sole proprietor-ships. The outcome for the sector represents thesum of the extrapolation results of the threegroups specified.
In addition, the area encompassed by the extrapo-
lation has been extended from western Germanyto comprise the whole of the Federal Republic.This step was necessary, firstly, because data byform of business organisation were available in thecontext of the turnover-tax statistics only forthe whole of the Federal Republic. Secondly, it was
appropriate because, in particular, the incidence ofeast German annual accounts at the Bundesbankhas decreased significantly, so that a separateanalysis of their profitability and financing patternshas no longer been possible of late. The inferiordatabase for the new Länder does not seriously im-pair the quality of the extrapolation for the FederalRepublic as a whole, since eastern Germany, ac-counting for a turnover share of 6% of the eco-nomic sectors covered by the corporate balance-sheet statistics (industry, trade and transporta-tion
11) has a relatively low weight.
For the extrapolation, three business-organisation
groups were formed: corporations, partnershipsand sole proprietorships.
12Problems of definition
arise in the case of the “Kapitalgesellschaft und
Co”, which, economically speaking, is a hybrid
form, consisting of corporation and partnership. In
9The analyses of the profitability and financing patterns
of east German enterprises in the financial years 1991 to
1997 that were published in the Monthly Report of the
Deutsche Bundesbank between 1993 and 1999 consti-
tute an exception. They were based on comparable
groups of firms, because an extrapolation was not pos-
sible since the basis of balance-sheet data relating to east
German enterprises was too limited.

62the extrapolation, firms in this form of business
organisation (in line with the requirements of theturnover-tax statistics) are classified as partner-ships, even if, in terms of liability, they more closelyresemble corporations. Another factor arguing infavour of their treatment as partnerships is thatthe typical Kapitalgesellschaft und Co., as regards
its size and its asset and liability structure, is morelike an enterprise operated as a partnership than a“traditional” corporation. Enterprises in the formof a cooperative society, a civil-law association, afoundation or an institution incorporated underpublic law, which, formally, do not belong in anyof the three groups, were classified among thegroups “corporations” and “partnerships” in ac-cordance with the criterion of economic similarity.Cooperative societies were classified as corpor-ations, since their statutes usually provide for thelimited liability of their members – limited, for in-stance, to their capital contribution or to the max-imum amount of their liability. The same thing ap-plies to foundations and institutions incorporatedunder public law. Civil-law associations, by con-trast, are to be regarded as partnerships in eco-nomic terms.
Extrapolation by form of business organisation has
major advantages over the method of analysis em-ployed hitherto. The improvement of the results interms of representativeness and stability must bementioned first. Representativeness increases be-cause the form of business organisation exerts asignificant impact on the structure of the balancesheet and profit and loss account (as the above an-alysis has made clear) and because the differencesbetween the basic entity and the data available tothe Bundesbank are cancelled out directly by theextrapolation by form of business organisation.Some offsetting already took place under themethod of extrapolation employed in the past,since there is a close correlation between corpor-
ate size and corporate form of organisation, but itfell short of what can be achieved by the more so-phisticated method. Moreover, the extrapolation issafeguarded more by including the form of busi-ness organisation as a third criterion, since a great-er segmentation of the data is ensured, and therisk that firm-specific special factors will impingeon the sectoral and overall results is reduced.
All in all, the extrapolation by form of business or-
ganisation cancels out the structural differencesbetween the Bundesbank’s data and the totality ofenterprises in Germany more effectively than theold method of analysis. That applies particularly tothose sectors which are mainly characterised bysmall and medium-sized firms, i.e. in which part-nerships and sole proprietorships carry relativelyheavy weight. There, the new results of the ex-trapolation differ perceptibly in part from those ob-tained without distinguishing between differentforms of business organisation (see the table onpage 63). Thus, the equity-capital ratios for themanufacturing sector, the construction sector, theretail trade and transportation, taking the averageof the period from 1994 to 1999, are distinctlybelow those of the old extrapolation method. Bycontrast, the average profit-turnover ratio be-tween 1994 and 1999 works out slightly higher inthe extrapolation by form of business organisation.As regards the development of the financing andearning patterns, however, the “old” and the“new” series largely coincide.
Furthermore, the new approach makes possible an
analysis of corporate earning and financing pat-terns by form of business organisation which – asthe above article has shown – yields a number ofnew perceptions, compared with the traditionalapproach. In addition, the data by form of business

64organisation can be fitted more easily into the
framework of the new European System of Ac-counts (ESA ’95), in which enterprises, as a func-tion of their form of organisation, are assigned tothe enterprise sector (corporations and partner-ships) or to the household sector (sole proprietor-ships). Considered in terms of economic sectors,however, results by form of business organisationcan be shown only for segments that are suffi-ciently represented both in the totality of enter-prises and in the data available to the Bundesbank.At the level of the branches of the manufacturingsector, this condition is commonly not fulfilled.That also applies to the branch of the energy andwater-supply sector, in which there are hardly anypartnerships or sole proprietorships. That is whyextrapolations by form of business organisationare published only for the manufacturing sector asa whole, the construction sector, the wholesaleand retail trade and the transportation sector.
Changes in the underlying data have given rise to
other methodological adjustments, which weredescribed some time ago.
13In terms of both vol-
ume and composition, the available data is insuffi-cient to permit the extrapolation of the years 1998and 1999. In recent years, owing to changes inmonetary policy instruments following the launchof Stage Three of EMU on January 1, 1999, the
balance-sheet data available to the Bundesbank,especially from smaller and medium-sized firms,has decreased noticeably. Rediscount credit, whichused to form the basis for the submission of an-nual accounts to the Bundesbank, no longer fea-tures in the arsenal of policy instruments of theEurosystem. Since that time, annual accounts havebeen required to check the creditworthiness of thedebtors of loans to non-banks and trade bills,which are deposited by credit institutions, alongwith securities, to hedge repo transactions withthe Eurosystem. On account of the strict standardsapplied to such checks, the number of the annualaccounts of firms of poor creditworthiness hasdeclined disproportionately fast. As a makeshift,the figures for 1998 and 1999 were determined byupdating, with the aid of the extrapolation, figuresfor a comparable range of firms, in which onlythose annual accounts for which the previousyear’s figures were also available were included. Bythat means, this selection effect is largely elimin-ated. The updating is based on about 32,000 an-nual accounts for the year 1998 and on some26,000 annual accounts for 1999.

How to pave the road to E(M)U:
the monetary side of the enlargementprocess (and its fiscal support)
A year ago the European Council decided to
launch a dialogue between the EuropeanUnion and the accession countries. This ex-change of opinions is intended to achievegreater clarity as to how the parties involvedview the road to the EU and the euro. Withthis in mind, the Bundesbank’s Economic Re-search Centre, the National Bank of Hungaryand the Center for Financial Studies at theUniversity of Frankfurt co-hosted a confer-ence in late October. This meeting was,above all, dedicated to addressing issues inconnection with the monetary environment

80of the accession process. The conference
was attended by academics, economists anddecision-makers from the countries involved.
The conference programme had four focal
topics (see the overview on page 81):
– Which exchange-rate regime seems best
equipped to promote the convergenceprocess in the accession countries over thecoming years?
– Which monetary policy strategy should
those countries choose?
– How have financial systems developed in
the accession countries and what is thefuture outlook?
– What challenges will fiscal policymakers in
the accession countries be facing in theyears to come?
This conference revealed that, for a whole
raft of issues, there are no great differencesof opinion. Generally speaking, the major ad-vances made in the transformation processwere emphasised. There was also little appar-ent divergence of opinion about the signifi-cance of some key elements of the trans-formation process, such as the liberalisationand privatisation of the economy and, espe-cially, of the financial markets. In other areas,though, there is evidently still a considerableneed for debate, particularly about howquickly these countries should aim to join thenew exchange-rate mechanism (ERM II) andat what time the euro can then be introducedin those countries.Over the past decade, the transformation
countries have chosen a variety of exchange-rate regimes, ranging from flexible exchangerates to systems in which exchange rates fluc-tuate within a band to currency boards. Manycountries have also changed their exchange-rate regimes during this period. Despite thisvariety, the macroeconomic results have beenrelatively similar, especially the overall successin reining in the very high rates of inflation ofthe early nineties. This makes it clear that themicroeconomic reform of institutions andmarkets was a priority over the past decade.Now that the structures have been moreclosely aligned with those of Western-stylemarket economies, however, it may be ex-pected that macro policy, including the choiceof exchange-rate regime, will receive greaterattention in future.
There was no consensus among the confer-
ence participants as to the best way of hand-ling the convergence process in terms of ex-change rates. At one end of the spectrumwas a school of thought in favour of at leastsome central and east European countriesjoining ERM II as soon as possible and thenkeeping this stage as short as possible prior toentry into monetary union. The opposite viewwas that these countries should maintain theflexibility of their exchange rates for a num-ber of years, using the freedom thus gainedmainly to press ahead with the process of realconvergence. The time spent in ERM II shouldalso be used in that manner, it was said.Some researchers favoured a solution inwhich accession countries would unilaterally– and prior to monetary union – make theeuro legal tender in their countries.

82posal encountered opposition, though. The
differences of opinion are due to a range ofdiffering assessments. For one thing, therewas no consensus on the issue of whether itis only “extreme” exchange-rate regimes –freely floating exchange rates or rigid, institu-tionally fixed rates – that can be stable orwhether in-between solutions are also pos-sible. There were also varying assessments asto whether accession countries would be cap-able of forming an optimal currency area to-gether with the euro-zone countries in thevery near future, which would make fixed ex-change rates seem prudent, or whether, say,asymmetrical shocks present a real danger,which would require flexible exchange rates.
In this debate, the issue of whether and to
what extent short-term capital inflows andoutflows can be expected to render anexchange-rate strategy more difficult in theyears to come has gained a fair amount ofimportance. At the conference, empiricalfindings were presented which indicate thatshort-term capital flows into the accessioncountries are expected to increase strongly infuture, but that such flows could reversethemselves just as quickly if conditionschange. At any rate, experience has shownthat capital flows are more important in de-veloped economies with modern financialsystems than would still appear to be thecase in eastern Europe at present. Such ascenario indicates potential problems forwhich economic policymakers in those coun-tries, in particular, have to be prepared.
In the debate, attention was also devoted to
the Balassa-Samuelson effect. This postulatesthat countries in the catch-up process will
tend to experience relatively sharp price in-creases in the non-traded goods sector,which, on balance, cause their currencies toappreciate in real terms. However, it is notclear how much of a factor this effect will bein future. What is more, it only shows upunder certain conditions, and economic pol-icymakers do have ways of counteracting it.Even so, there was a discussion on whethersuch an effect would justify modifying theMaastricht convergence criteria or whetherthese considerations would rule out rapidaccession to monetary union.
Although the conference was principally dedi-
cated to the potential challenges facing the ac-cession countries, accession naturally also hasmany diverse implications for the economiesalready in monetary union. The Maastrichtconvergence criteria are a case in point; theywere intended to protect stability policy frombeing undermined as a result of enlargement.Enlargement could well mean the equilibriumrate of the euro against non-euro-area coun-tries will be different from that of the presenteuro zone. The NATREX model for describingequilibrium real exchange rates, which waspresented at the conference, provides a frame-w o r kf o rs u c ha n a l y s e s .F o ri n s t a n c e ,i ts t a t e sthat long-term exchange-rate effects will beinfluenced by whether accession leads to in-creased growth in Europe (which would favoura trend towards appreciation), or whether theneed for investment in the enlarged Europec a no n l yb em e tb yt h ei n c r e a s e du s eo fs a v i n g sfrom non-euro-area countries (which wouldtend to have an adverse impact on the ex-change rate).

83The choice of exchange-rate regime is also a
fundamentally important element of monet-ary policy in the economies in question. Aslong as countries permit at least a certaindegree of flexibility in their exchange rates,central banks will have to decide on an inde-pendent monetary policy strategy. Many ofthose economies are relatively small, withexports and imports being a major factor.Such countries will therefore always needto pay attention to developments in theircurrencies’ exchange rates and the conse-quences thereof.
The type of monetary policy strategy in which
the exchange-rate regime should be embed-ded is open to debate. During the con-ference, the possibilities of a strategy of amedium-term inflation forecasting manage-ment were discussed in particular detail.However, it is evident that any forward-looking monetary policy strategy will encoun-ter problems owing to limited past experienceand the rapidity of change in those countries.
For the future road to enlargement of the EU
and EMU, the financial systems of the acces-sion countries are of crucial importance for avariety of reasons. International experiencehas shown that a well-functioning financialsystem is needed to complement a well-developing economy. Such a financial systemcan also make an important contribution toan economy’s ability to withstand shocks atthe lowest possible cost. In the final analysis,an efficient monetary policy is also dependenton being able to exert an impact on the econ-omy through developed financial marketsand financial institutions. During the confer-ence, features which characterise internation-
ally tried and tested systems were discussed.Experience has shown that competitive andliberal financial systems – albeit with clearlydefined legal frameworks and effective super-visory structures – constitute a good basis fora prosperous economy. Whether a system ismore bank-based or more financial-market-based is a secondary issue. What is more im-portant is that market forces are given achance to act. State-owned banks have oftenfound it difficult to promote economic devel-opment, for example.
To some degree, the liberalisation of financial
systems is either being put on hold or beingundertaken only very cautiously out of fearsof increased vulnerability to crises. An empir-ical study of liberalisation, investigating alarge number of industrial and developingcountries, concluded that, although stock-market volatility may increase immediatelyafter government controls have been dis-mantled, liberalised stock markets are notinherently more prone to crises but actuallymore stable.
With that in mind, the financial systems in
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republicwere analysed in depth. Despite differencesof detail, major progress has been observedin all three countries over the past decade.Privatisation and foreign credit institutions’involvement in those countries have both hada positive impact. However, a number of indi-cators show that the standards of Westernindustrialised economies have not yet beenachieved. That is true of the significanceof bank loans and even more so of capital-

84market-based corporate financing. In that
connection, however, attention should bedrawn to the particular structures that exist inthose countries. Specifically, many major dir-ect investment projects are financed throughforeign banks. Also, the efficiency of acces-sion countries’ financial institutions still ap-pears to be below par in many cases. Lastly, alack of legal certainty may present a barrier tothe intensification of financial relationships.Although the legal foundations are mostly inplace, there are also signs that the enforce-ment of legal claims is not always regulatedin a satisfactory manner.
Over the next few years, fiscal policymakers
in the central and east European countrieswill be facing a major challenge. It is true thatthe figures for government deficits and levelsof debt are often more favourable than theywere for some of today’s euro-zone membersduring the preparatory phase prior to monet-ary union. However, some warning flagswere raised during the conference. One pointto ponder is that in many cases burdens fromancillary budgets still exist which have not yetbeen included in the official figures on publicfinances. That is a consequence of the needto restructure credit institutions with problem
loans, for instance. However, it seems moreimportant to note that these countries needto make up a lot of ground in terms of infra-structure investment, thus making it import-ant to get their priorities right. And for thatto happen, suitable political decision-makingstructures are necessary. When taking deci-sions on government revenue and expend-iture, the first concern should be to ensurethat the forces of growth are strengthened.For that reason, too, those countries have toset themselves particularly high efficiency andfiscal prudence standards since they are to alarge extent dependent on other countries’confidence and willingness to invest.
The conference is likely to have contributed
to raising awareness of the problems that lieahead in the accession process. It has alsopromoted the ongoing dialogue betweenuniversity academics and representatives ofthe institutions involved, as well as betweenthe participants from eastern Europe andwestern Europe. The conference clearlyshowed how important it is for this exchangeof opinions to be continued in the years tocome.

for statistical purposes only, primarily to analyse their development over in terms of their coverage (new business and/or outstanding amounts), th e
time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. Thenational interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. —1En-
