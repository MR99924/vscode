IndustrySeasonally adjusted industrial output in Au-
gust was down on the month, July havingproduced a high figure. This was not a sign ofa cyclical deterioration, however. The adversedevelopment was, in fact, due mainly to theschool holidays (which may be regarded as anindicator for the summer holiday period)being concentrated this year on the month ofAugust. In order to characterise the outputtrend, it is therefore advisable to look at Au-gust in conjunction with July, which hadbenefited from a comparatively minor holidayeffect. On an average of these two months,seasonally adjusted output was around 1
1/C254%
higher than the average from April to June.Even though it should be noted that a down-ward revision of the provisional figure may beexpected for August, there is still a slight cyc-lical increase compared with the low in out-put in the second quarter of the year. Howslight the recovery is, however, is revealed bythe fact that output in July and August justabout matched its level of 12 months earlier.
No more than a subdued cyclical upturn is
also suggested by incoming orders, the fig-ures for which are still provisional. In August,they were scarcely up on the two precedingmonths in seasonally adjusted terms and,moreover, will probably be revised down-wards. According to current information, Julyand August taken together were around 1%up on the low second-quarter level and justover
1/C252% down on the year. Additional orders

6intermediate goods producers and, to a lesser
extent, producers of capital goods. Theseorders originated predominantly abroad. Do-mestic demand remained at a low level.
ConstructionIn the construction sector, too, the particular
timing of the holidays was a contributory fac-tor in a seasonally adjusted month-on-monthdrop in output in August. Combining July andAugust in order to offset the impact of theholidays produces a slight quarter-on-quarterrise in output. According to the data availableso far, the figure was around 5
1/C252% down on
the year. Even though the figures have yet tobe adjusted to the results of the annual over-all survey – which means that a year-on-yearcomparison has only limited validity – the de-cline does point to the fact that the construc-tion sector has still failed to emerge from itstrough.
Nevertheless, new construction orders did
show a clear seasonally adjusted increase inJuly. A factor in this was that a number offairly large-scale projects were started in roadconstruction and for the railways and post.There was also an increase in new housingconstruction orders, which may be connectedwith the debate on cuts in assistance forhousing construction. Overall, the level ofconstruction orders placed was still 3

lower than in the same period of 2002.

7tor made a positive contribution to overall
output in the third quarter of 2003. Further-more, surveys report a recovery in the case ofbusiness service providers. Developments inthe wholesale and retail trade were subdued.Hotels and restaurants suffered further lossesof business. Overall, the slight decline in over-all output recorded in the first half of 2003 isunlikely to have continued. In fact, on thebasis of the currently available data, it may beassumed that there was a slight increase ingross domestic product (GDP) after adjust-ment for seasonal and working-day vari-ations. However, it is still not possible to iden-tify a sustained cyclical upswing which wouldlead the economy out of its persistent phaseof stagnation in the near future. This is alsoindicated by the continued cautious assess-ments of the current situation as revealed bysurveys, such as that conducted by the IfoInstitute in trade and industry.
Labour marketThe situation on the labour market worsened
further in the summer months. In July (morerecent data are unavailable at present), theseasonally adjusted number of persons inwork fell by almost 50,000 to 38.03 million.In June, the decline amounted to no morethan 20,000 – not least owing to the latestart of the holidays. On an average of Juneand July together, the level of redundancieswas roughly just as high as it had been inApril and May, although it was smaller thanat the beginning of the year. The year-on-year fall widened again to 650,000 persons,or 1.7%.In September, counter to the underlying
trend in employment, there was a slight sea-sonally adjusted fall in the number of personsofficially registered as unemployed. At theend of September, 4.39 million persons wereregistered as being out of work. Althoughthis was 265,000 more than 12 months earl-ier, it was 14,000 fewer than at the end ofAugust. The unemployment rate based onthe national definition fell to 10.5%; accord-ing to the standardised EU definition, the fig-ure was unchanged at 9.4%. This decline inofficially registered unemployment was duemainly to the efforts of the Federal LabourOffice in applying stricter criteria for providingassistance and in placing greater emphasis onclaimants playing an active role in job seek-ing. This resulted in a continuing large num-ber of outflows from unemployment into an-other form of non-employment. The adversecyclical impact is revealed by the large num-ber of persons previously in work who regis-tered as unemployed and by the declininglevel of vacancies reported to the labour ex-changes.
PricesThe slight rise in consumer prices continued
in September. Food, especially vegetables, be-came significantly more expensive as a resultof the exceptionally hot and dry weather inthe summer months. The seasonally adjustedrate of price increase remained within narrowbounds in the case of services. Excluding in-creased telephone charges and some higherinsurance premiums, however, a downwardadjustment would have been to be expectedfollowing the sharp holiday-related rise in

declining prices in the preceding months, in-dustrial goods became somewhat more ex-pensive again. According to the GermanConsumer Price Index, prices went up 0.2%overall in seasonally adjusted terms. As inAugust, the year-on-year figure was +1.1%.The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices(HICP) also shows an annual rate of inflationrunning at the same level.
The domestic factory gate prices of industrial
products showed a slight seasonally adjustedrise in August. This was partly due to the veryhigh crude oil prices. The year-on-year in-crease in producer prices went up to 2.1%,the figure being only +0.4% if energy sourcesare excluded. In the case of imports, too, itwas mainly energy that became more expen-sive because of oil prices, although therewere also sharp increases in the case of otherimported goods after prices had been goingdown in the preceding months. The rate ofyear-on-year fall in import prices went downto 1.7%. Excluding energy, prices were 2.2%lower than 12 months earlier.
Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
Indebtedness of central, state and local gov-
ernment increased by 34.9 billion in August.
By far the largest borrower was central gov-ernment, which raised 34.0 billion net. Sales
of bonds yielded as much as 37.2 billion for
central government; this was primarily attrib-utable to the topping-up of the Federal bond
(Bund) issued in July. Furthermore, the vol-ume of outstanding Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) and Treasury discount paper(Bubills) both rose by 30.6 billion. Central
government received a further 31.3 billion by
raising loans against borrowers’ notes. Onthe other hand, liabilities arising from five-year Federal notes (Bobls) were repaid in theamount of 35.9 billion net. Money market
debt increased by 30.2 billion.
At30.8 billion, net borrowing by state gov-
ernment remained relatively low in August.While 31.8 billion was raised through short-
term cash advances from banks, the out-standing volumes of bank loans declined by30.7 billion and the amount of Treasury notes
outstanding fell by 30.3 billion. The indebted-Net borrowing in the market

9ness of the German Unity Fund fell by 30.2
billion, with the repayment of bank loans inthe amount of 30.3 billion being partly offset
by a participation in the top-up of the Bundissue amounting to 30.1 billion. Local govern-
ment appears to have drawn marginally onthe credit markets in August.
Central government borrowingIn September – a month featuring a major tax
payment date – central government expand-ed its indebtedness by 31.8 billion. At 31.0
billion, the larger part of this amount wasborrowed on the money market, whilst thecapital market was drawn on for 30.8 billion
net. However, as sizeable redemptions had tobe made, particularly in the case of Sch/C228tze,gross central government borrowing wasmuch higher at 322.5 billion. Central govern-
ment raised 36.9 billion through the sale of
Sch/C228tze, with the regular quarterly issue bear-ing an interest rate of 2.5%, thus making itpossible to refinance an issue from Septem-ber 2001, carrying a coupon of 3.75%, onfavourable terms. Central government alsoraised substantial amounts by topping up theBund launched in July 2003 with a couponof 3.75% ( 36.8 billion including market-
smoothing operations) and through theBubill tender ( 36.4 billion including market-
smoothing operations), the average yield ofwhich, at 2.06%, roughly corresponded tothe previous month’s level. Bobls and bankloans contributed 31.3 billion and 31.0 bil-
lion, respectively, to gross borrowing.
In the period from January to September cen-
tral government’s borrowing in the marketamounted to 3185.0 billion gross and 340.7
billion net. This development indicates thatthe net borrowing requirement of not quite319 billion budgeted for by central govern-
ment for 2003 as a whole will be greatly ex-ceeded, primarily because of shortfalls in taxrevenue owing to the overall economic situ-ation and the additional burdens incurredthrough the labour market expenditure. Theamount of additional resources required willhave to be quantified in a supplementarybudget which the Federal Government isplanning to submit to parliament soon. As re-gards the breakdown of the new borrowing,Bunds and Bobls played a particularly signifi-cant role, yielding 311.7 billion and 39.1 bil-
lion net, respectively. Sales of Sch/C228tze, whichraised 36.7 billion, also made a major contri-
bution. With net proceeds of 33.1 billion,Net borrowing in the market by central

Securities markets
Bond marketThe volume of issues in the German bond
market decreased in August. Domestic bor-rowers issued bonds to a market value of375.4 billion, compared with 3104.6 billion in
July 2003. Redemptions and changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds amount-ing to 384.2 billion meant that the volume of
domestic bonds outstanding was 38.8 billion
lower in August. In July 316.1 billion (net)
had been raised from sales of this kind ofpaper. On balance, 30.8 billion worth of for-
eign bonds were sold in the German market.Overall, 38.0 billion net worth of domestic
and foreign bonds were thus redeemed inAugust.
In August the public sector increased its bond
market debt by a mere 30.8 billion. The Fed-
eral Government sold 30.5 billion net of
bonds (July: 38.9 billion). A 37.0 billion in-
crease in the volume of ten-year Federalbonds (Bunds) outstanding was offset by a36.6 billion decline in the volume of Federal
notes (Bobls) outstanding. Net sales of30-year Federal bonds and of two-yearFederal Treasury notes raised 30.3 billion and
30.2 billion respectively. The Land govern-
ments increased their bond market debt by30.1 billion.The volume of bank bonds outstanding de-
creased by 310.8 billion net in August, fol-
lowing an increase of 311.3 billion in the pre-
vious month. Developments of “uncovered”other bank bonds, most of which have short-er maturities, were the main factor contribut-ing to this decrease; the market volume ofthese bonds shrank by 311.5 billion. The vol-
ume of mortgage Pfandbriefe and publicPfandbriefe outstanding declined by 30.9 bil-
lion and 31.4 billion respectively. The only
positive figure was for net sales of bondsissued by specialised credit institutions(33.0 billion). Corporate bonds were sold for
31.1 billion net in August, compared with
30.2 billion in July.
In August the main buyers in the bond mar-
ket were domestic non-banks. They added313.5 billion to their bond portfolios, allocat-
ing almost equal amounts to purchases of do-mestic and of foreign paper. Domestic creditinstitutions, however, reduced their holdingsof bonds and notes by 314.6 billion. They de-
creased both their holdings of domesticbonds (- 38.2 billion) and foreign bonds and
notes (- 36.5 billion). Foreign investors sold
36.9 billion net of domestic bonds and notes.
They purchased 31.6 billion net worth of
public sector bonds and sold 38.5 billion of
bonds issued by private borrowers.
Equity marketAgain hardly any funds were raised in the
German equity market. In August domesticenterprises placed new shares to a marketvalue of only 30.1 billion (July: 30.7 billion).

marily by foreign investors ( 32.3 billion). The
credit institutions added 30.8 billion net
worth of German shares to their portfolios.By contrast, domestic non-banks sold domes-tic equities amounting to 32.9 billion in
August, after having expanded their holdingsagain slightly in July ( 30.6 billion).
Mutual fund sharesIn August domestic mutual funds sold 32.5
billion worth of shares, compared with 31.3
billion in July. As in July, most of the funds ac-crued to mutual funds open to the generalpublic ( 31.8 billion). In August investors
showed a preference for share-based funds,which sold shares amounting to 30.7 billion
(July: - 30.1 billion). Open-end real estate
funds sold shares amounting to 30.6 billion
net, ie less than in the previous month ( 31.4
billion). Investment in bond-based fundsamounted to 30.5 billion and in mixed funds
30.4 billion. Money market fund shares were,
however, redeemed for 30.3 billion. German
mutual fund shares were purchased mainlyby residents ( 31.7 billion), primarily non-
banks. Foreign investors added 30.8 billion
worth of mutual fund shares issued by Ger-man investment trusts to their portfolios.
Balance of payments
In August, Germany’s current account sur-
plus, at 32.3 billion, was up on the previous
month. This was partly due to a substantialdecrease in the deficit on invisible currenttransactions, which is that part of the currentaccount comprising services, factor income
and current transfers. As regards trade ingoods, however, Germany saw a drop-off inits surplus.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus in August fell, primarily due to seasonalfactors, by 33.7 billion on the month to
310.4 billion. The elimination of seasonal fac-
tors resulted in only a slight decline in thesefigures, the reason being the stronger per-formance of imports in comparison with ex-ports. In August, imports climbed 2% on theprevious month, while exports increased byonly 1%. Almost half of this growth in im-ports, however, is attributable to the higherprices of imported goods, whereas the trendin exports was almost exclusively influencedSales and purchases

12by volume effects. In the combined June-
August period, exports were 1% up on theprevious period (March-May), whereas im-ports were down by almost 3%.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents slipped to 37.7 billion in
August from 312.3 billion in July. This was pri-
marily due to the considerable drop in factorincome payments to non-residents, whichslumped to 30.3 billion net in August (com-
pared with 35.3 billion in July). In contrast,
the deficit on services, at 34.7 billion, was
somewhat higher than the previous month.Net expenditure on current transactions re-mained virtually unchanged at 32.8 billion.
As regards portfolio transactions with non-
residents, August saw a slight acceleration inthe outflow of funds ( 35.7 billion net com-
pared with 30.8 billion in July). This was
largely the result of foreign investors trim-ming their net holdings of German securities(34.4 billion) after having already shown only
marginal interest in acquiring such securitiesthe previous month ( 30.4 billion). They divest-
ed themselves exclusively of German moneymarket paper ( 39.3 billion) and, in return, in-
vested 32.4 billion in German bonds and 31.7
billion in shares. German savers, too, were ra-ther hesitant in investing in the internationalsecurities markets, as in the previous month(31.3 billion in August and 31.2 billion in
July). They invested primarily in foreignmoney market paper ( 32.5 billion) – along-
side shares ( 30.2 billion) and investment fund
certificates ( 30.2 billion) – but, in so doing,
sold a net 31.7 billion worth of bonds.Major items of the balance

compared with a net outflow of 32.1 billion
in July. German direct investment abroad fellby31.9 billion net, primarily due to loan re-
payments made by non-resident branchesand subsidiaries to their German parent com-panies. Foreign proprietors, however,strengthened their foothold in Germany byinjecting 32.8 billion of capital into their
German branches.
In the field of non-securitised credit transac-

predominantly scaling back their short-termbalances with foreign banks. In addition, thepublic authorities borrowed 30.7 billion net
from abroad. By contrast, the non-securitisedexternal transactions of the entire banking sys-
tem – including the Bundesbank’s transactions,which are classified as credit transactions – ledto exports of funds totalling 312.8 billion. In this
regard, the balances of the TARGET paymentsystem were only of secondary importance.

15Germany’s competitive
position and foreign
trade within the
euro areaJoining monetary union represented a
major turning point for the Germaneconomy. The introduction of the euromeans that foreign trade with euro-area partner countries can now be con-ducted in a common currency. As a re-sult, there are no longer any exchangerate risks, and transaction costs are re-duced. The launch of monetary uniontherefore promised a further increasein trade with the other countries ofthe euro area. Besides creating trade,monetary union is also expected toredirect trade. Enterprises may findit more (cost-)effective to substituteintra-EMU trade for some of the tradepreviously conducted with non-euro-area countries. However, the empiricalfindings on German foreign trade inthe first four and a half years of mon-etary union only partially substantiatethese lines of reasoning. There has in-deed been quite sharp growth in Ger-many’s trade with its EMU partnerssince 1999, but the increase in tradewith countries outside the euro areahas been even greater. When thesefindings are being interpreted, how-ever, due account has to be taken ofthe fact that growth differentials andshifts in price competitiveness havemainly stimulated trade in goods withnon-euro-area countries.

16Theoretical considerations relating to the
impact of monetary union on foreigntrade
Following the customs union and the single
market, monetary union is a further step inEuropean economic (and political) integra-tion. Economists have long been discussingthe implications of such regional and monet-ary integration for foreign trade. The litera-ture identifies three mechanisms, in particu-lar, through which a monetary union mightgenerally stimulate trade among the partici-pating countries.
– First, there are declining transaction costs
because cross-border trade within the cur-rency union (intra-trade) can be conduct-ed in a single currency and therefore nolonger entails an exchange of currencies.
– Second, in the monetary union there are
no longer any fluctuations in the nominalexchange rates. In principle, this shouldencourage intra-trade. Although it is fun-damentally possible to hedge against ex-change rate risks, this incurs currencyhedging costs which increase along withthe length of the planning horizon. Overextended periods, however, an enterpriseengaged in foreign trade will be able toprotect itself directly against exchangerate fluctuations only with difficulty or notat all. This is likely to apply mainly to smalland medium-sized enterprises which haveonly limited means to deploy indirecthedging, say, by diversifying their produc-tion sites across national borders, and this,it is argued, might pose an obstacle toprecisely such enterprises in developing
their foreign trade.
1
– Third, it is to be expected that increased
price and cost transparency will lead, vialower prices, to an upturn in demand andthus – at least in real terms – to more in-tense trade.
It is reasonable to assume that, for these rea-
sons, exporting enterprises benefit from thecreation of a monetary union. Furthermore,firms for which the costs of foreign tradehave hitherto presented a barrier should alsoincreasingly start to participate in cross-border trade. This is likely to lead to an accel-eration in the foreign trade of countries tak-ing part in monetary union. Such an effect isdescribed as “trade-creating”.
Another – at least theoretical – outcome of a
monetary union is the redirection of trade.For the reasons mentioned, monetary unionmakes cross-border trade within the singlecurrency area more attractive than trade withnon-euro-area countries. Intra-trade there-fore tends to replace the exchange of goodswith non-euro-area countries if such tradingis still subject to exchange rate uncertaintyand matching transaction costs. Followingthe creation of a single currency area and theassociated intensification of intra-trade, theshare of intra-trade in the total foreign trade
1In the literature, there are varying assessments of the
impact of exchange rate risks on foreign trade. The avail-
able studies suggest that the trade of industrial countries,
in particular, is only slightly curtailed, if at all, by exchange
rate risks. See IMF , World Economic Outlook, September

17of the countries participating in the currency
union should therefore increase.
Empirical studies come to very widely varying
conclusions with regard to the quantitativeimpact of a monetary union on foreign trade.Andrew Rose, for example, uses a gravitymodel which is expanded by the membershipof a currency union to show that the mem-bers of a monetary union can have bilateraltrade flows which are three times as large asthose of other countries.
2However, his data-
set covers mainly fairly small and compara-tively poor countries as well as currencyunions which each have one large dominanteconomy. The findings are therefore not dir-ectly applicable to European monetary union.Recent studies also take account of thecauses of the intensity of trade between, forexample, neighbouring countries that are notdue solely to monetary union.
3With an
estimated growth in the volume of tradeamounting to just over 50 %, these studiesproduce significantly lower, albeit still sub-stantial figures. On the basis of various stud-ies, the British Treasury recently came to theconclusion that joining European monetaryunion might increase the United Kingdom’strade with the euro area by between 5 % and50 % without simultaneously affecting thetrade of goods with other countries.
4The
wide spread of the figures cited reveals thelarge degree of uncertainty surrounding suchestimates of monetary union’s effects on for-eign trade. Moreover, it is to be expected thatsuch effects will be achieved only in the longterm and not after just a few years. Despitesuch reservations, it is interesting to study therelevant experience of Germany in the firstfew years after the changeover to the single
currency.
Development and major determinants of
German foreign trade since the launch ofmonetary union
Overall, there has been a sharp increase in
German foreign trade since the launch ofmonetary union. This was especially the casein 1999 and 2000. Up to the first half of2003, exports of goods grew by a seasonallyadjusted average of 7 % in nominal termswith a matching figure for imports of 5
1/C252%.
Part of the growth – mainly in imports – wasdue to higher prices, however. In real terms,the annual increase was therefore only 6 %on the export side and just over 3
1/C252% on the
import side.5
Trade in goods has also increased significantlyfaster than gross domestic product (GDP).The German economy’s degree of openness,defined as the sum of exports and imports ofgoods in relation to GDP , was roughly 56 % inthe first half of 2003. It was therefore higherthan in the late 1980s for the Federal Repub-lic of Germany as its territory was defined atthat time. On the import side, the continuingeconomic downturn of the past three years

18has ultimately had a dampening impact on
the activities of German importers.
Owing to the comparatively rapid export
growth, Germany has been able to achieve afurther slight increase in its real market sharein world trade since the launch of monetaryunion. Between 1998 and 2002, this sharewent up by around 1 percentage point to10
1/C252%, after having already picked up from
its 1995 low in the three years before. TheGerman economy’s regained competitivestrength also has to be seen in the context ofnew opportunities for foreign trade expan-sion arising mainly from the opening of thecentral and east European economies (see ex-planatory notes on pages 20-21).Regionally, at an average annual rate of 6% in
the past four and a half years, the expansionof German foreign trade (exports and importstaken together) with non-euro-area countrieswas sharper in real terms than the growth inintra-trade (3
1/C252%).6However, this had also
been the case, for example, in the eight yearsprior to monetary union. The expected effectsof monetary union (and at least in some re-spects, those of the single market) in boostingand redirecting trade – which should havebenefited mainly intra-trade – are not immedi-ately identifiable in these figures for Germany.
As already mentioned, when evaluating these
discrepancies, due account should be takenof the fact that the effects which monetaryunion has on foreign trade undoubtedlyemerge only in the long term and may there-fore appear, if at all, only in embryonic formduring the period observed. In the periodsunder observation here, experience hasshown that the effects emanating from thegrowth of export markets and the compos-ition of goods demanded by non-residentsare dominant. Furthermore, changes in pricecompetitiveness have an influence on the de-velopment of exports and imports.

7Although foreign demand has a direct impact only on
German exports, it also has an indirect, albeit weaker im-
pact on imports owing to the large import content of the
exports.
8The extent to which changes in price competitiveness
affect foreign trade as a whole (exports and imports) de-
pends on enterprises’ pricing behaviour and on the elasti-
cities of exports and imports. It may be assumed that an
improvement in price competitiveness stimulates exports
and dampens imports; the net effect can only be deter-
mined empirically. For Germany, econometric studies in-
dicate that, in terms of their price competitiveness, ex-
ports have a higher elasticity than imports, thus produ-
cing a positive net effect.Increasing real

19over, not only have there been shifts in price
competitiveness between Germany and non-euro-area countries – resulting primarily fromchanges in the euro exchange rate. Therehave also been shifts in price competitivenesswithin the euro area owing to varying devel-opments in costs and prices.
Taking the period 1999-2003 as a basis, the
growth of the non-euro-area economies hasbeen distinctly more rapid than that of Ger-many’s partner countries in the euro area. TheInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) estimatesgrowth in the world economy during thisperiod to have averaged 3
1/C252% annually; if
Germany is excluded, however, the euro areaexpanded up to the first half of 2003 by anannual average of no more than just under2
1/C252%. Non-euro-area trading partners’ de-
mand for German goods is therefore alsolikely to have been stronger.
Given the existing patterns of specialisation in
German foreign trade with a concentrationon capital goods (including motor vehicles),the structure of foreign demand may alsohave been a major factor in the developmentof exports. There are only incomplete relevantdata on this, however. Moreover, IMF andOECD estimates of fixed capital formation forthe period 1999-2003 show hardly any differ-ences between the advanced economies as awhole and the euro area (excluding Ger-many). Thus, the structure of demand evi-dently does little to explain the discrepanciesin regional export developments.
A similar picture to that in world economic
growth emerges if developments in importdemand in Germany’s major markets are con-
sidered. Since the launch of monetary union,imports of goods by the other euro-areacountries – Germany’s major export marketaccounting for roughly 43
1/C252% of all German
exports – have risen by an annual average ofno more than 2
1/C252% in real terms whereas
the IMF estimates that global trade hasgrown by just under 5 % during this period.
9
As already mentioned, other competitorshave contributed to these regional differen-tials. These countries are attempting to estab-lish their place in the international division oflabour. Especially important, from a Germanperspective, is the fact that the two-waytrade in goods with the countries of centraland eastern Europe has been showing de-cidedly buoyant growth since the opening ofthe Iron Curtain. These countries’ geograph-ical proximity to Germany, cost advantages inproduction and the high level of German dir-ect investment in the region have all beenmajor factors in this development.
The above-mentioned demand trends both in
and outside the euro area have been accentu-ated by changes in price competitiveness. Thedepreciation of the euro in the first two yearsof monetary union led for a time to a signifi-cant improvement in the price competitive-ness of the German economy (and of theother euro-area economies) vis-/C224-vis the non-euro-area economies. Even the ensuing ap-
9The IMF bases its calculation of world trade on total ex-
ports and imports of goods. As the differentials in the
average growth rates are minor, however, the basic state-
ment that global economic growth has been markedly
stronger than the growth in other euro-area countries’

20Deutsche BundesbankInternational competitiveness of the German economy and of the other euro-area countries
An economy’s international competitiveness is deter-
mined by a whole series of price and non-price factors. In general, price competitiveness is assessed with par-ticular reference to cost and price relationships between the domestic economy and its foreign competitors after 
adjustment for exchange rates – ie expressed in one 
currency. Such indicators are calculated in a variety of ways for both Germany and the euro area as a whole. Experience has shown that the best indicators of real price competitiveness are those which capture the rela-
tive prices and costs of internationally traded goods as 
comprehensively as possible.
 1 The indicators used for 
Germany are the relative deﬂ  ators of total sales and 
unit labour costs in the corporate sector, both of which show a quite similar proﬁ  le.  For the euro area, the ECB 
provides comparable indicators with the real effective exchange rate of the euro based on unit labour costs in 
the economy as a whole and the GDP deﬂ  ator.
 2
For the period since the launch of monetary union, 
these indicators largely show a comparatively favour-
able degree of price competitiveness for both Germany 
and the euro area as a whole. For example, based on 
the deﬂ  ator of total sales in the period from early 1999 
to the second quarter of 2003, Germany’s mean price 
competitiveness vis-à-vis its major non-euro-area trading 
partners was around 10 ½ % up on its long-term average since 1975. For the euro area as a whole, the compara-ble real external value of the euro based on the GDP 
deﬂ ators likewise points to competitive advantages (of 
roughly 7 ½ %).
 3 In both cases, the main reason for this 
was the depreciation of the euro in the ﬁ  rst two years 
of monetary union. An additional factor from the Ger-
man perspective was that, owing to a lower rise in costs, domestic enterprises’ price competitiveness also showed an improvement against that of competitors from other 
euro-area countries. 
In addition to price and cost factors, which are captured 
by the described indicators, an economy’s international competitiveness is also inﬂ  uenced by other variables 
such as product quality, customer service, punctuality of delivery, capacity for innovation and ﬂ  exibility. Such 
qualitative features are difﬁ  cult to capture in their total-
ity. For that reason, the result of enterprises’ foreign trade activities is often used as a basis, and shares of the 
world market which reﬂ  ect all competitive factors are 
applied as a reference variable for assessing competi-
tiveness. Nevertheless, when interpreting world market shares, it should be borne in mind that, up to a point, they are ”backward-looking” indicators which tend to 
reﬂ ect an economy’s past strengths and weaknesses 
rather than its future ones. 
Furthermore, the world market shares which are nor-
mally used and which are based on nominal variables
may give a distorted impression if there are sharp 
exchange rate movements. The sharp depreciation of the euro against the US dollar in 1999 and 2000, for example, led to a decline in Germany’s (nominal) share 
of the world market although other indicators, such as growth in (real) exports and relative costs and prices 
indicated an improvement in price competitiveness. The assessment of an economy’s competitive position should 
therefore be based on real (rather than nominal) world 
market shares which are adjusted for exchange rate and price effects.
 4
In the recent past, the German economy’s real world market shares have largely been consistent with its price

21competitiveness on the world markets (see adjacent 
chart). 5 Since the mid-1990s, Germany has recorded a 
sharp increase in real world market shares – an increase which continued after the launch of monetary union. At 
10 ½ % in 2002, Germany gained a larger share of the 
world market than at any time since the early 1990s.
 6
What is noteworthy in this context is that, of all the euro-area countries whose price competitiveness beneﬁ  ted in a similar fashion from movements in the 
euro exchange rate, it is, above all, Germany that has 
signiﬁ  cantly expanded its real world market share since 
the launch of monetary union (+1 percentage point). 
The other euro-area countries’ total share of real global exports remained nearly unchanged during this period, however. If individual countries are considered, it was 
only Ireland – a country catching up with the advanced 
economies – that likewise achieved a slight gain in mar-
ket share (around ¼ percentage point), while Italy and 
Belgium lost ground somewhat internationally.
The shifts in shares of world trade are also to be seen 
in the context of the advances made by the emerging economies in South-East Asia and the ongoing inte-
gration of central and eastern Europe into the global economy. This has resulted in the industrial countries 
suffering losses in overall market shares in foreign trade since they have been replaced in some cases by other suppliers. By contrast, the German economy has been 
able to strengthen its international competitive posi-
tion, mainly because it has used the opportunities pre-
sented by trade with the countries of central and eastern 
Europe. The geographical proximity to Germany of these 
economies has undoubtedly been a major advantage in 
this process.Owing to a high level of direct investment, German 
enterprises have also opened up new markets in this 
region and ensured the competitiveness of their domes-tic output, as far as this has been possible, by means of cost-effective subcontracting of supplies.
10 At the same 
time, there has been a sharp increase in the two-way 
trade in goods (by an annual average of just under 12 % since the launch of monetary union). This now accounts 
for 13 % of total German foreign trade (exports and imports combined) and a good 22 % of trade with non-
euro-area countries.

only by a deterioration in price competitiveness but also by domestic output being redirected to eastern Germany in the wake of reuniﬁ  -

22preciation of the single currency up to the
early summer of 2003 did not entirely offsetthis competitive edge. In the second quarterof 2003, German enterprises’ price competi-tiveness vis-/C224-vis economies outside the euroarea was still somewhat better than on along-term average since 1975, which mayserve in this context as a yardstick for a neu-tral competitive position. That is at least thecase when applying the broadly defined indi-cator of the German economy’s price com-petitiveness based on the price deflators oftotal sales, which the Bundesbank calculateson an ongoing basis. The price and costadvantages enjoyed by German producersbecome clearer if the entire period sincethe introduction of the euro is taken into con-sideration. The mean price competitivenessof the German economy in this period hasbeen 10
1/C252% better than on a long-term
average.
Since the launch of monetary union, there
have also been shifts in the price competitive-ness of the German economy vis-/C224-vis theother countries of the euro area. Owing tothe single currency, however, these shiftshave been due to differing developments inprices and costs among the individual partici-pating countries rather than to exchange ratemovements. By mid-2003 the price competi-tiveness of German producers in relation tothat of their euro-area competitors had im-proved quite significantly (namely, by around5 %) compared with its level at the end of1998.

23and compared with its long-term mean value,
it becomes apparent that, by this yardstick,Germany has possessed competitive advan-tages within the euro area, too, since theadoption of the euro (around 2 %), althoughthese have been smaller than those vis-/C224-visnon-euro-area countries.
A similar, though not quite so favourable pic-
ture is produced by measuring competitive-ness on the basis of relative unit labour costsin the corporate sector rather than on defla-tors of total sales. On this basis, Germany’scompetitive position vis-/C224-vis the other euro-area countries during the period from early1999 to mid-2003 was somewhat less fa-vourable than when the deflators of totalsales are used. The difference is mainly attrib-utable to cost advantages deriving from im-ported inputs, which are reflected in themore broadly defined indicator of total costs.
It may be noted provisionally that the de-
scribed dynamics of demand as well as themarked improvement in German producers’price competitiveness have contributed to thecomparatively sharp growth in German for-eign trade with these non-euro-area coun-tries and may have partially obscured the sup-posed effects of monetary union. Moreover,the recent downturn in the euro area hascurbed Germany’s cross-border trade ingoods with partner countries in the monetaryunion; even the slight improvement in Ger-many’s competitiveness vis-/C224-vis the othereuro-area countries has not been able to off-set this development entirely. Despite thecomparatively slight increase in German ex-ports of goods to other euro-area countries,German exporters have increased their mar-
ket shares not only in the world market as awhole but also within the euro area.

The fact, described here, that German export-ers have held their own well in comparisonwith suppliers from other euro-area countriesis occasionally also modelled by export per-formance. This is not based on market sharesbut on exports in comparison with exportmarket potential. Since German exports tothe other euro-area countries since thelaunch of monetary union have grown morerapidly than those countries’ intra-importsoverall, German suppliers’ export perform-ance in the euro area, between the launch ofmonetary union and mid-2003, increased byan average of just under 1

10The calculations of German market shares of total
euro-area exports are based on Eurostat data. To avoid
double counting as well as errors and omissions, the re-
gional classification of these data does not entirely match
the methodology used by the Federal Statistical Office. In
particular, flows of goods from non-euro-area countries
are captured as transactions with non-euro-area coun-
tries only by the country to which they were delivered for
customs purposes. For the intra-trade flows, this means
that they are ascribed to the country of consignment and
not to the actual country of origin.
11For the purpose of the calculation, the other euro-
area countries are regarded as a single economic area.

procedure for determining export performance. For the

(8 %) and Ireland (7%) while these countriessimultaneously lost very significant ground– if measured by the deflator of total sales –to domestic suppliers. This also applies, albeitto a lesser extent, to Italy, which is also amajor market for German exports within theeuro area (+7
1/C252% between early 1999 and
the first half of 2003) but whose economyshowed no more than relatively moderategrowth in the period under review. In thecase of other countries – such as Belgium,Portugal and Austria – where cost develop-ments were more unfavourable than in Ger-many or which had growth rates below theeuro-area average, the increase in Germanexports was slower than in German intra-exports overall.
Identifying the change in German exporters’
euro-area market share in terms of the break-down of goods is more difficult than a region-al analysis. German exporters’ specific (real)market shares in intra-trade in intermediate,capital and consumer goods may be calcu-lated in line with their predominant use eitherfor production or consumption;
12these have
remained virtually unchanged since thelaunch of monetary union, however. To whichproduct categories Germany’s gain in marketshare is to be attributed is therefore initiallyunclear. At all events, the data show thatcross-border trade in capital goods – as ashare of Germany’s total foreign trade – in-creased in real terms in the first three years ofmonetary union; this applies pro rata to intra-trade in capital goods as well. Nevertheless,
given the global weakness in investment,these shares fell perceptibly in 2002. On theexport side, the German capital goods sectorhad a roughly 31
1/C252% share of aggregate
intra-trade in this segment last year. Germa-ny’s (real) export market shares in the euroarea are smaller in the case of intermedi-1998 Q4 to 2003 Q2

12For these three goods segments, the BEC (Broad Eco-
nomic Categories) classification is used. Intermediate
goods include unprocessed or processed food, drinks,
other material such as building materials, paper, textiles,
metals, fuels and lubricants (with the exception of petrol)
as well as parts and accessories for capital goods and
motor vehicles, predominantly produced for use in pro-
duction. Capital goods include machinery and motor ve-
hicles but not private motor vehicles and associated parts
and accessories. Consumer goods are deemed to be dur-

One serious drawback of the classification ofgoods by Broad Economic Categories is itsfailure to assign what in recent times hasbeen an increasing proportion of goods toone of the three main categories. This ap-plies, for example, to private motor vehicleseven though it is precisely this sector that isof major importance for the German econ-omy, with motor vehicle and vehicle parts– accounting latterly for 19 % of total Ger-man exports – playing a very significant rolein the export sector, too. Moreover, it ismainly with motor vehicles that Germany hasachieved its notable track record of success inexports over the past few years. However,the aforementioned growth differential and(price) competitiveness mean that this has
been achieved, for the most part, outside theeuro area. In any case, between 1999 and2002, total German exports of motor vehicleswent up by an annual average of 9
1/C252%,
which was a significantly faster rate ofincrease than that in exports as a whole.The only area in which German exportersachieved comparable rates of growth was ininformation and communications technology(ICT) even though exports of this categoryof goods slumped in 2002. By contrast, ataround 7 %, German motor vehicle exportsto other euro-area countries grew (in nominalterms) at only a slightly faster pace than Ger-man intra-exports overall.
In the case of German imports of goods, the
other euro-area countries have, to a smallextent, surrendered “market shares” to non-euro-area countries (down from 46 % to45 % in real terms) since the launch of mon-etary union. In actual fact, the opposite mighthave been expected – not only on accountof the trade-creating effect of monetaryunion but also because of the temporarydepreciation-induced gain in price competi-tiveness by enterprises in the euro area vis-/C224-vis suppliers from non-euro-area countries.What was evidently more significant, how-ever, was the strong competition from centraland east European countries in the Germanmarket. By the end of the period under re-view, these countries had increased theirshare of German imports to 14 %. In the pastfour years German imports from the other%

27euro-area countries have shown only very
weak growth mainly in those categories ofgoods “occupied” by the new competitors,such as mechanical engineering products,ICT and vehicles.
However, when euro-area suppliers are com-
pared with each other, differing develop-ments in prices and costs – in addition to spe-cial factors – have certainly played a part. Forexample, countries with above-average risesin costs, such as Italy, Greece and Portugal,have lost market shares to German intra-imports while countries with a flatter devel-opment in costs, such as Austria and Finland,have gained shares. The special developmentsin ICT, which has been subject to sharp fluctu-ations during the past few years, has impact-ed on German imports from Ireland. Despiteshowing a fairly large decline in some years,in the first half of 2003 they were still signifi-cantly up on the corresponding figures priorto monetary union.
Summary and conclusions
There has been a marked increase in German
foreign trade during the past four and a halfyears, although the launch of monetaryunion is likely to have played no more than aminor role in this development. Factors of
greater significance were undoubtedly the, attimes, strong demand stimuli (principally fromoutside the euro area), the relatively favour-able price competitiveness of German sup-pliers and the trend towards the internation-alisation of production, which was given afurther boost by the integration of the centraland east European transition countries. Notleast for that reason, German foreign tradewith non-euro-area countries has increasedmore sharply than intra-trade with the euro-area partner countries. Even so, German en-terprises have also held their own in competi-tion with suppliers from the other euro-areacountries and have slightly increased theirmarket shares of intra-EMU exports. Thisdemonstrates – as do other indicators – thecompetitiveness of the German export sectorcompared with enterprises from other euro-area countries. However, the fact that thehigh rates of growth in German foreign tradewere achieved mainly in 1999 and 2000 andthe marked flattening of exports since 2001during the global economic downturn alsoreveal the major importance of a favourableworld economic environment for German for-eign trade. The generally expected upturn inthe global economy and in world trade istherefore likely to provide the German econ-omy with a new impetus.

29The economic situation
of small and
medium-sized enter-
prises in GermanySmall and medium-sized enterprises in
Germany are currently facing a particu-larly difficult situation. An evaluationof the Bundesbank’s corporate balancesheet statistics according to size classes,presented here for the first time, con-firms this assessment. In the sectorsanalysed, the persistent sluggish growthenvironment has had a greater impacton the earnings of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) than on thoseof large firms. This is likely to havebeen due mainly to the greater relativedependence of SMEs on the (weak)domestic economic activity. Moreover,the financing conditions for small andmedium-sized firms, which had alreadybeen tight for some time, have deteri-orated further. In particular, the lowlevel of own funds represents a majorweakness. Given the large amount ofSMEs’ outstanding bank borrowingcoupled with the banks’ heightenedrisk awareness, improving the equitycapital base is likely to be a major pri-ority for many small and medium-sizedenterprises in the next few years. Inthis context, it is imperative that theyboost their profitability. Significanteconomic policy measures have alreadybeen initiated in this context. The la-bour market and social security systemreforms currently being discussed willalso assist small and medium-sizedenterprises, which as a rule, are fairlylabour-intensive.

30Overall economic environment
The German economy has been in a state of
virtual stagnation since mid-2000, which hashad an especially negative impact on smalland medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alsoknown in Germany as the Mittelstand. One
major reason for this is that the root of theweak growth momentum can be foundmainly in the trend in domestic demand, onwhich small and medium-sized enterprisesare generally far more dependent than largeenterprises. The latter, as is illustrated ingreater detail below, are usually more export-orientated and more diversified. In addition,the construction industry, which has been in asevere adjustment crisis since the mid-1990s,consists predominantly of small and medium-sized enterprises. Given macroeconomicgrowth from mid-2000 to mid-2003 of merely
3/C254% in working-day-adjusted terms, real do-
mestic demand declined by 13/C254%, whereas
real exports as defined in the national ac-counts expanded by 8%. Now, however, thegrowth phase in exports has also halted. Inthe first half of 2003 seasonally adjusted realexports fell by 1
1/C252% vis-/C224-vis the second half
of 2002. In addition to the weak global econ-omy, the situation has been compounded inparticular by the preceding strong appreci-ation of the euro against the US dollar.
The basic pattern of weak domestic demand
coupled with a relatively robust export busi-ness was also typical for most of the 1990s.From 1993, when the German economy wasin a cyclical trough, until 2000 real domesticdemand – although it did not contract – re-corded a relatively low average annual paceof expansion of 1
3/C254%, while exports grew by
8% per year. All in all, however, macroeco-nomic growth in this period rose by an annualaverage of less than 2% and thus by a farsmaller margin than the other large industrialnations with the exception of Japan. Sincethe reunification boom petered out in theearly 1990s, Germany has mostly registeredthe poorest economic performance of all theeuro-area countries.
In the industrial sector the contrast between
sluggish domestic business and robust exportbusiness was even more pronounced than inthe economy as a whole. According to theofficial statistics
1domestic turnover increased
by 16% from the cyclical low in 1993 up to2002; in the same period, foreign sales nearlydoubled.
The persistent weakness of the domestic
economy has resulted in small and medium-sized enterprises being confronted mostlywith a weakening demand for nearly tenyears now. Moreover, in economically difficulttimes large companies seek to push down theprices of the intermediate goods they pur-chase. As a result, smaller supply companies,which as a rule do not have much bargainingpower vis-/C224-vis large customers, often seetheir thin margins eroded further.

31conducted on behalf of the Institute, the dif-
ferences in the export orientation of large en-terprises and small and medium-sized enter-prises are quite considerable. In this survey,only enterprises which are active in the exportbusiness were analysed. The export ratio, ieexport turnover as a percentage of overallturnover, of large exporting enterprises withan annual turnover of more than DM100 mil-lion was 23.7%, which was considerablyhigher than enterprises in the smaller sizeclasses (not including small enterprises withan annual turnover of below DM100,000).Export ratios there ranged from 12
1/C252%t o
19% in 1999. This finding is further accentu-ated by the fact that many SMEs, in particularin the construction industry and in the retailtrade, are not (directly) involved in exportbusiness at all.
Definition and economic position of
small and medium-sized enterprises
The statistical definition of small and medium-
sized enterprises is normally based on the cri-teria “annual turnover” and “number of em-ployees”. Even though there is no uniformnational and international definition, in Ger-many the definition of the Institute for SMEResearch has found widespread use. Accord-ing to this definition, firms are classified assmall enterprises if they have less than 31 mil-
lion in annual turnover and up to nine em-ployees. Medium-sized enterprises are thosewith 31 million to 350 million in annual turn-
over and between 10 and 499 employees.Firms with greater turnover and larger staffare classified as large enterprises.
3For the fol-lowing analysis of the profitability and finan-
cing of SMEs, however, the classification ac-cording to annual turnover is the only rele-vant factor since the annual accounts, whichare evaluated in the context of the Bundes-bank’s corporate balance sheet statistics, donot all contain data on the number of em-ployees, thus making the criterion of numberof employees inapplicable.
The small and medium-sized enterprises
which have been classified as such accordingto the number of employees and turnover areto be considered enterprises of the Mittel-
stand in the stricter sense if they also fulfil
additional qualitative criteria. Besides man-agement by the owner, these include autono-mous economic activity, which notably re-quires complete or virtually complete inde-pendence of any larger economic entity. Ac-cording to the European Commission’s defin-ition, this condition is met if the capital inter-est held by a large firm in an SME is below25%. However, even the presence of formalindependence is not always an accurate indi-cator of the actual leeway an independentsmall or medium enterprise has for decision-making. An SME may have very little real free-dom, for example, if it is dependent on only afew large customers which determine to alarge extent its product features, prices aswell as other business terms and conditions.
3The turnover threshold separating small and medium-
sized enterprises from large enterprises matches the new
threshold contained in the European Commission’s draft
of 2001 amending the recommendation of 1996 con-
cerning the definition of small and medium-sized enter-
prises. According to this, the threshold value for the num-
ber of employees (249), however, will continue to be
markedly lower. The Commission’ s definition also in-
cludes the criterion of an annual balance sheet total of
no more than 343 million.Definition of

32However, such a classification according to
the degree of independence cannot be madein the extrapolations of the Bundesbank’s cor-porate balance sheet statistics since the turn-over tax statistics do not include such data.

This article can therefore focus only on thequantitative definition. However, the resultinginaccuracies are not very great. In the Bun-desbank’s source material, 93
1/C252% of SMEs
are independent enterprises. This is in linewith the IfM’s findings, according to whichnearly 95% of SMEs are completely inde-pendent, ie have no capital ties with otherenterprises.
5Measured by turnover, however,
the share of dependent companies amongthe small and medium-sized enterprises – ac-cording to the Bundesbank’s corporate bal-ance sheet data – amounts to just overone-tenth and is thus somewhat higher.
The major importance of SMEs can be
gleaned from the following data and ratios:
– In 2000, there were 2.89 million non-
financial enterprises subject to turnovertax in the group of small and medium-sized enterprises with less than 350 mil-
lion in annual turnover; these made up99.7% of all enterprises subject to turn-over tax. They generated 43.4% of allturnover reported in the turnover tax stat-istics.
– According to IfM estimates, in 2000 small
and medium-sized enterprises (includingthose not subject to turnover tax) em-ployed around 70% of the overall work-force and provided 83% of all vocationaltraining.
6They generated just under half
of all enterprises’ total gross value added.
– The research and development activities
of small and medium-sized enterprisespresent a rather heterogeneous picture.According to the IfM, which uses surveysas a basis of information, in 1999 morethan 10.4% of staff in firms with less than100 employees were engaged in researchand development. This figure is actuallyhigher than in larger enterprises with over5,000 employees, in which “only” around8% of staff were engaged in research anddevelopment. It is striking, however, thatenterprises in the size class from 100 to249 employees and from 250 to 499 em-ployees only had 5.5% and 4.6% of staff,respectively, working in the area of R&D.
Business start-ups and insolvencies
The large macroeconomic importance of
SMEs lies in part in the dominant role theyplay in business start-ups. According to IfMestimates, in the years 1996 to 2000 theaverage number of newly registered busi-nesses in Germany (adjusted for relocations,

6These estimates are based in part on data on employ-
ees who are subject to social security insurance contribu-
tions; these data apply to operational units but not to en-
terprises. As a result, the weighting of SMEs tends to be
too high; particularly in the retail trade, small and me-
dium-sized operational units are often affiliated to large
enterprises. See Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksban-
ken und Raiffeisenbanken, BVR special; Mittelstand in

500,000 per year. The bulk of these can beattributed to small and medium-sized enter-prises.
7In the same period there were also an
annual average of 410,000 liquidations – alsoadjusted for “spurious” deregistrations – re-sulting in a net number of 90,000 new busi-nesses every year. In the past two years, how-ever, the economic downturn and the disen-chantment regarding the potential of theNew Economy have led to a steep decline inthe number of business start-ups. Since thenumber of liquidations has declined at aslower pace, the positive balance of start-ups– according to Bundesbank estimates – sankto around 60,000 in 2002.
Business insolvencies within total liquidations
attract widespread public attention. At ap-proximately 37,500, the number of insolvententerprises in 2002 was two-and-a-half timesgreater than in 1993; in the period 1999 to2002 alone, there was an increase of 42%.At 129 per 10,000 enterprises, the insolvencyrate reached a new peak in 2002. In particu-lar, the protracted economic downturn andsluggish growth in Germany have contributedto the steep increase in insolvencies by erod-ing many enterprises’ revenue and depletingtheir financial reserves. Moreover, on 1 De-cember 2001, a new clause was introducedin insolvency legislation which allows de-ferred payment of the costs of insolvencyproceedings if the debtor is unable to pay. Asa result, insolvencies increased in 2002 notonly among consumers, but also among soleproprietorships and small firms.
8However,
should the forecasted economic recovery ma-terialise, the number of insolvencies will prob-ably decrease in the next few years. Further-
more, the distortions in the insolvency statis-tics caused by invoking the new statutoryprovision are likely to wane.
The risk of failure is inherently far greater in
the case of new businesses than in estab-lished enterprises. For this reason alone theinsolvency rate is greater among new andmainly small firms. It therefore comes as nosurprise that following a wave of businessstart-ups, a certain weeding-out process willoccur during an economic downturn.

The earnings situation of small and
medium-sized enterprises
In 2001, the pre-tax annual result of small
and medium-sized enterprises in the produ-cing sector, wholesale and retail trade and inthe transportation sector was a good 3%below that of 1994, the year from whichdata for the whole of Germany have beenavailable in the corporate balance sheet stat-istics.
9Developments here were very volatile;
following the strong earnings recovery in1994 (which is indicated in the figures forwestern and eastern Germany, which werefor a time collated separately), earnings de-clined markedly until 1996. In the two follow-ing years, however, they rose sharply. On thewhole, earnings increased by nearly 30% in1997 and 1998. Profits began to weakenagain in 1999 and declined considerably in2000. Over the entire three-year period 1999Methodological notes on the extra-
polation results by size class
The evaluation in this article presents for the first time
extrapolation results differentiated also according tosize classes. Up to now, data breakdowns from the cor-porate balance sheet statistics were presented exclu-sively by sector and form of business organisation.
1
Although methodological particularities emerge whenconducting an evaluation according to size classes, thesedo not impair the information value of the results.
In order to establish the data for the two turnover size
classes below and above 550 million, new extrapola-
tions and estimates had to be calculated for the periodbetween 1994 and 2001. In this context, the bounds ofthe size classes in individual legal-form and sectoralgroups were adapted in such a way that all of thegroups have a uniform threshold value of 550 million.
Owing to a lack of data, this resulted in size classes insome combinations of legal form/sector which couldnot be extrapolated. As a result, the sum of the size-class-specific extrapolations deviate marginally down-ward from the previously published results – for exam-ple, by 0.2% of turnover in 2000, the latest year forwhich data breakdowns by form of business organisa-tion are available from the turnover tax statistics.
In addition, the separate extrapolation which was per-
formed owing to a certain redrawing of the thresholdsof the size classes led in the case of individual annual re-sult items to deviations vis-/C224-vis the previously pub-lished results. In particular, this affects the financialyears from 1998, for which a separate extrapolation wasnot possible in view of the deteriorating data material;the data trends were therefore merely estimated on thebasis of the extrapolation results from 1997.
Account must also be taken of the fact that the extrapo-
lation results by size class are subject to somewhatgreater uncertainty than the results of a conventionalextrapolation owing to the differing definitions of en-terprises in the corporate balance sheet statistics (princi-ple of the smallest legal entity) and the turnover tax sta-tistics collected by the Federal Statistical Office (princi-ple of the corporate group). The differences in the allo-cation of enterprises to the size classes which resultfrom the varying enterprise definitions can be largelyneutralised only after being aggregated across sizeclasses. However, the fact that in our study the classifica-tion was restricted to just two size classes minimises thiseffect.

9The annual result corresponds to the annual profit be-
fore profit or loss transfers. It provides a better indication
of the earnings generated by the enterprises analysed in
this article as numerous firms are associated through
profit transfer agreements (and partial profit transfer
agreements) with enterprises which are not included in
the corporate balance sheet statistics (eg holding com-
panies) and to/from which their profits/losses are trans-
ferred. The distinction between annual profit and annual
result is, however, less significant for SMEs since the de-
gree of economic integration is rather low. However, this
distinction is necessary in the case of large enterprises

35to 2001 the gross annual result shrank by no
less than 15%.10
By contrast, larger enterprises increased theirgross profits from 1994 to 2001 by approxi-mately 64%, which works out at 7
1/C252% per
year on average. It is especially remarkablethat in 1997 and 1998, profit increases in thiscategory were twice as large as in the groupof small and medium-sized enterprises. In2000, the earnings differential between thetwo groups was even more pronounced.SMEs sustained a decline in profits amountingto 8
1/C252% in the wake of pressure on their
sales volume caused in particular by sharprises in oil prices, which resulted directly inlarger energy expenditures and indirectlyweakened consumers’ purchasing power andfirms’ propensity to invest. Given the vibrantglobal economy which carried on well intothe year, larger enterprises, by contrast, man-aged to increase their gross annual result by12
1/C252% in 2000. One year later, however,
when export business faltered perceptibly inthe wake of the global economic downturn,firms with an annual turnover of more than350 million posted a particularly marked de-
cline of 14%. If one also includes figures for1999, which was dented by the East Asia cri-sis, gross profits of larger enterprises likewisefell considerably – from a relatively high levelin 1998 – by 5
1/C252% up to 2001.
To a large extent, SMEs’ disappointing earn-
ings trend since 1994 is a result of the rela-tively unfavourable domestic economic envir-onment described at the start of this article.Furthermore, in the 1990s small and me-dium-sized enterprises appeared less ablethan larger enterprises to exploit their ration-
alisation potential and curb rising costs. It isDM

and sole proprietorships are a widespread form of busi-

taxed in the “private sphere” of the entrepreneurs them-

37likely, too, that larger enterprises were better
able to benefit from the greater flexibility instructuring their staff’s working hours afford-ed to them by collective agreements and tobenefit more from the international integra-tion of production than smaller businesses. Acase in point is the increased outsourcing ofcertain production operations.
At just under 2
1/C252% in 2001, SMEs’ gross re-
turn on turnover, which indicates the ratio ofthe annual result before taxes on income toturnover, was at its lowest since 1996; in1998 and 1999 this figure had been justunder 3%. Although larger enterprises sawthis ratio decline by a similar margin in thetwo following years, in 2001 this figure wasperceptibly higher at 3%. The actual returndifferential is probably even greater. First, thewidespread form of business organisation inthe SME segment, namely partnerships andsole proprietorship, include the (imputed)proprietor’s income in the reported annual re-sult. By contrast, corporations include the sal-aries of managers or top executives in labourcosts, which means that the reported profitsof non-corporations are correspondingly high-er. This also puts the higher return on turn-over of the non-corporations vis-/C224-vis corpor-ations in the SME segment into perspective.A second point to bear in mind is it thatSMEs’ risk of insolvency is traditionally signifi-cantly higher than that of larger enterprises.The return on turnover therefore reflectsvarying risk premia for invested capital. If therelatively large number of mainly low-profitborderline SMEs which are no longer con-tained in the corporate balance sheet statis-tics are taken into consideration, the earnings
gap of SMEs is even greater.
The overall figures for SMEs in the segments
covered by the corporate balance sheet statis-tics mask significant sectoral differences. Asexpected, the construction industry showedthe poorest performance from 1994 to 2001.Gross profits in this sector declined by morethan four-fifths. In 2001 the return on turn-over was only
1/C252%; taking account of the im-
puted proprietor’s income, it was even lower.Wholesale trade, the gross annual result ofwhich in 2001 was 30% below the 1994level, was last-but-one on the earnings scale.As a proportion of turnover, however, profitsin 2001 nonetheless reached almost 2%. Bycontrast, SMEs in the manufacturing sectorachieved cumulative profit growth of 15
1/C252%
over the period under review. In addition, atjust under 3% in 2001, the return on turn-over was markedly above the average of allSMEs. This figure appears less impressive,however, compared to larger enterprises inthe manufacturing sector, which increasedtheir gross profit by 68
1/C252% between 1994
and 2001; at 31/C252%, the ratio of their annual
result to turnover for 2001 likewise distinctlyexceeded that of the SMEs in this sector.
The transportation sector recorded the largest
earnings increase between 1994 and 2001,followed by the retail trade, which posted again of 30%. At first glance, this appears tobe incongruent with a sluggish consumptionenvironment and phases of declining retailturnover. However, on closer inspection, itemerges that in this one sector, small andmedium-sized enterprises fared better thanGross annual

38larger enterprises, which saw profits drop by
one-quarter. At 21/C252%, SMEs’ return on turn-
over in the retail trade in 2001 was also muchhigher. This is largely due, however, to thepreponderance of partnerships and sole pro-prietorships in this sector; as mentioned, theirprofits include the imputed proprietor’s in-come.
Income and cost in detail
In the sectors under analysis, SMEs’ total out-
put, which in addition to turnover, includeschanges in stocks of own products and othercapitalised production, increased by only 4%from 1994 to 2001, or just over
1/C252% per year.
The sharp falls in the construction industry(-14
1/C252% ) and in the wholesale trade (-61/C252%)contrasted with gains in other sectors; the
largest gains were recorded in the transporta-tion sector (+23
1/C252%) and in the manufactur-
ing sector (+121/C252%). Including interest in-
come and other income, SMEs’ total incomegrew by 5% – ie somewhat more than theirbusiness activity in the narrower sense. As ex-pected, the contrasts between the SMEs andlarge enterprises with respect to profits alsoapply to total income, which in the case oflarge enterprises increased by 42% from1994 to 2001.
From 1994 to 2001 SMEs’ cost of materials
grew by 3
1/C252%, ie somewhat more slowly
than total output. As a result, the ratio be-tween these two items fell slightly to 58%.By contrast, labour cost grew at an above-average pace to reach almost 23% of totalSmall and medium-sized enterprises’ return on turnover, by economic sector*

39output in 2001. It is interesting to note that
larger enterprises recorded an opposite trend.The cost of materials at these enterprises roseconsiderably faster than business activity, as aresult of which the share of these costs intotal output surged to 68
1/C252%. By contrast,
labour cost increased only moderately; itsshare grew by 3 percentage points to 14%.Similarly clear differences are observable, forexample, within the manufacturing sectorand thus do not hinge directly on the varyingsectoral mix in the two size classes. One pos-sible explanation for this is that larger enter-prises were better able to take advantage ofthe greater flexibility afforded to them withregard to working hours as well as the advan-tages of the growing national and inter-national division of labour. According to stat-istics provided by the Federal Labour Office,whereas firms with 500 and more employeessubject to social security insurance contribu-tions shed 11% of their jobs between 1995(March) and 2001 (June), smaller firms in-creased their workforce by 2
1/C252%.
Another striking difference between the two
turnover size classes is evident in the depreci-ation of tangible fixed assets. In the SME sec-tor, this cost item declined by 7
1/C252% since
1994, owing primarily to low investment. Theconstruction industry recorded a particularlysharp decline of 31%. In most of the othersectors, the consumption of fixed assets re-mained virtually unchanged, or rose onlyslightly. By contrast, depreciation of tangiblefixed assets at larger enterprises increased by11%. However, at 3% their share of totaloutput was
1/C252percentage point lower than atSMEs owing to stronger growth in business
activity.
Whereas the amount of interest SMEs paid in
2001 was barely above the level of the mid-1990s, larger enterprises’ interest expense in-creased by nearly half. This development prin-cipally reflects the more dynamic expansionof financial assets and the associated rise inthe level of indebtedness, which will beexamined more closely below. Interest paid asa share of total output by SMEs in 2001amounted to 2%, which per se is a low fig-
ure; however, this figure is twice the amountthat larger enterprises paid. The most sig-nificant factor in this is the relatively largeshare of bank loans in SMEs’ financing (seepage 43). The summary item “other cost” re-corded above-average growth in both sizecategories and stood at one-seventh of totaloutput in 2001.

40larger enterprises rose by well over 38%, or
more than 41/C252% per year.
A sectoral analysis shows that the average
balance sheet growth of SMEs was depressedin particular by the construction industry,which recorded a 2
1/C252% decline in the size of
its balance sheet from 1994 to 2001. The ex-pansion rates of the other sectors analysedhere ranged from 22% to 29
1/C252% – with the
exception of the wholesale trade, which re-corded growth of 14%. Thus the dispersion ismuch smaller than at larger enterprises,where this figure ranges from -13% in theconstruction industry up to 102% in thetransportation sector.
The differences in asset growth between
SMEs and larger enterprises can be explainedby strong divergences in the developmentof financial assets across all sub-items.Whereas at SMEs financial assets grew by14% – ie even more slowly than overallassets – they expanded by no less than 58%at larger enterprises. This trend was fuelledchiefly by participating interests which, froman already relatively high level in 1994, grewby 88
1/C252% up to 2001, with their share in
total assets concurrently rising by 5 percent-age points to 19
1/C252%. Although at 821/C252%,
the relative increase in participating interestsat SMEs was also very large, their book value,at 3% of the balance sheet total, was fairlyinsignificant. Moreover, the SMEs expandedtheir stock of debtors far less than the largerenterprises, which, in particular, considerablyincreased their debtors owed by affiliates.By contrast, the trend in tangible fixed assets
was largely the same at both SMEs and largerenterprises. In general, this position rose verylittle – by around 13% over the whole obser-vation period, or less than 2% per year. Thisis consistent both with the moderate turnovergrowth at SMEs as well as with the findingthat the sharper expansion of business activityat larger enterprises mentioned earlier wasaccompanied by a marked increase in theshare of intermediate consumption. Giventhe strong expansion of participating inter-ests, it appears likely that manufacturingfunctions were increasingly outsourced toaffiliated enterprises. Looking at total non-financial assets, ie including inventories, SMEsactually recorded higher cumulative growthover the observation period, at 18
1/C252%, than
larger enterprises, which registered an in-crease of 14
1/C252%.
The moderate growth of assets between
1994 and 2001 at small and medium-sizedenterprises in the sectors analysed was fi-nanced increasingly with own funds. Theseincreased by 21
1/C252% and thus distinctly fast-
er than creditors (+161/C252%) and provisions
(+15%). The ratio of own funds to total liabil-ities, the so-called own funds ratio, was justunder 7
1/C252% in 2001 –1/C252percentage point
above the 1994 level and 1 percentage pointabove the low reached in 1996. Viewed inisolation, this development is positive, but itshould not distort the overall picture that thelevel of own funds at SMEs was very lowright up to the end of the reporting period.As a percentage of overall liabilities, theymade up less than one-third of the compar-able figure at larger enterprises, whose own... and growth

42funds expanded by 41% between 1994 and
2001. However, owing to their greater bal-ance sheet growth, their own funds ratio like-wise grew by just
1/C252percentage point to
25%. In addition, it must be rememberedthat – as in the case of the income trend –the financial situation of SMEs is presentedtoo positively to the extent that the manyweak enterprises which became insolvent nolonger feature in the corporate balance sheetstatistics.
As is the case with other key ratios, the
trend in own funds at SMEs reveals markeddivergences among the individual sectors.In the manufacturing sector, the absoluteamount of liable capital increased consider-ably (+48
1/C252%); at 121/C252%, the own funds
ratio was also perceptibly above the compar-able figure in most of the other sectors.
Double-digit percentage gains were also re-corded in the wholesale trade and in thetransportation sector. By contrast, the equitylevel in the construction industry, already lowin 1994, was largely wiped out by 1997. Thissector has actually shown a negative netcapital position since 1998, which in 2001amounted to 1
1/C252% of the balance sheet
total. Small and medium-sized enterprises inthe retail trade consistently recorded a nega-tive own funds ratio on balance between1994 and 2001; nonetheless, this sector hasmanaged to reduce its capital deficit from alow of -5% in 1998 to -3% in 2001.
On closer inspection, it emerges that the bal-
ance sheet over-indebtedness only applies tothe subgroup of SMEs that are operated asnon-corporations. The own funds ratio ofsmall and medium-sized enterprises with thisform of business organisation declined from2% in 1994 to -
1/C252% in 2000 (figures for
2001 by form of business organisation arenot yet available). However, this finding hasto be seen in the context that the annualaccounts of non-corporations do not list allassets which are actually available as liablecapital. The proprietor has some accountingdiscretion as to whether assets are classifiedas private or business assets. Thus it is moreattractive to record financial assets and realestate as private assets for tax reasons, for ex-ample owing to the more favourable taxtreatment of capital gains from sales. How-ever, the liability of proprietors of sole propri-etorships and at least some of the partners ofpartnerships for their firm’s debts ultimatelyalso extends to their private assets not shown%Own funds as % of balance sheet total

43in the balance sheet. In addition, they often
post some of their private assets as collateralwhen procuring business loans. Conversely,since interest paid on bank loans is tax-deductible, there is an incentive to locateloans in the business accounts. The upshot ofthese tactical manoeuvres is that the balancesheets of non-corporations often reveal littleabout the actual financial state of the enter-prise in question.
In principle, much of the above also applies
to small and medium-sized corporations.Given the constraints imposed by insolvencylaw, however, balance sheet over-indebted-ness stretching over several years is possibleonly in exceptional circumstances. Not leastfor this reason, therefore, the group of SMEswhich are operated as corporations show“normal” levels of own funds in their balance
sheets, ie a positive figure. From 1994 to2000 their liable capital increased by 39
1/C252%
and in 2000 represented 16% of total liabil-ities, compared to 13
1/C252% in 1994.
In 2000 the average own funds ratio of cor-
porations with an annual turnover of lessthan 350 million was 10 percentage points
below the comparable level at large corpor-ations; this gap was even greater at the be-ginning of the observation period. This differ-ence is attributable, first, to the fact that itis easier for large public limited companies(PLCs), in particular, to procure additionalown funds, than it is for corporations in theSME segment. Second, this reflects diver-gences in capital intensity, which at largeenterprises is often higher than at small andSMEs’ provision with own funds by sector*

44medium-sized enterprises – in part for pro-
duction-related reasons. Another factor isthat the issue of splitting assets and liabilitiesinto the private and business sphere is of littlerelevance to large corporations and of norelevance at all to PLCs.
The liabilities structure of SMEs shows not
only a relatively weak ratio of own funds butalso a relatively low ratio of provisions to totalliabilities. In 2001 this figure was 8%, whichwas somewhat lower than in 1994. The ratioof provisions to the balance sheet total atlarge enterprises also tended to decline. How-ever, the ratio was still nearly 28% in 2001.Whereas at SMEs especially pension provi-sions – at 3% of total liabilities – played aminor role, this figure was 12% at larger en-terprises. This is mainly due to the fact that,for various reasons, small enterprises prefer,as the vehicle for occupational pensions, dir-ect insurance arrangements and contributionpayments to pension funds to an in-housecompany pension scheme, which is the soleform that allows firms to set up pension pro-visions.
12
The differences between SMEs and larger en-terprises with regard to own funds and provi-sions have their mirror-image in the level ofcreditors. At 84
1/C252% of total liabilities in 2001,
the share of creditors at SMEs was nearlytwice as much as at larger enterprises. In thepreceding years, the gap between the twogroups was of a similar magnitude. In thiscontext, SMEs relied mainly on short andlong-term bank loans, the significance ofwhich as a financing instrument increasedfurther during the course of the reportingperiod. Measured in terms of total liabilities,
their bank debt rose from 34
1/C252% in 1994 to
37% in 2001; non-corporations with lessthan 350 million in annual turnover had a
ratio of no less than 45% in 2001. By con-trast, larger enterprises’ outstanding bankloans made up little more than 9% of theirtotal liabilities; this share rose only marginallyduring the observation period. At 18
1/C252%, li-
abilities to affiliated enterprises played a big-ger role than bank loans for the larger firms.
Concluding remarks
The earnings and financing situation of SMEs
in Germany deteriorated markedly during thepast ten years. As a result, the disparity vis-/C224-vis larger enterprises, which had already exist-ed previously, widened further. This remainstrue even if one takes into consideration thatoften only a part of the liable capital is report-ed in the balance sheets of non-corporations.The protracted weak growth momentum inthe German economy undoubtedly had amajor impact on the unfavourable trend atSMEs. Experience suggests that only a sus-tained improvement in earnings leads to anincrease in enterprises’ financial strength andas a result replenishes their level of ownfunds. On the one hand, the amount of in-ternally generated funds increases and, onthe other, the enterprises also become moreattractive to external investors. However, inorder to better utilise this potential, the aver-sion on the part of many proprietors of SMEsto third parties holding equity interests in

45their enterprise – for fear of losing their deci-
sion-making competence – will have to beovercome and greater external transparencyachieved.
In the past few years, significant economic
policy measures have been adopted to en-hance enterprises’ earnings and financingsituation, for example the business tax reformthat came into force at the beginning of2001. However, these measures are insuffi-cient in themselves. Above all, structural re-forms are necessary in order to overcome thepersistent crisis of confidence and growth cri-sis.
13These include the consolidation of pub-
lic budgets and performance-promoting taxpolicies, the reform of the social insurancesystems, in particular with the goal of de-coupling social insurance contributions fromwage trends as well as enhancing the effi-ciency of the labour market. Specific incen-tives for small and medium-sized enterprisesare not an adequate substitute; they can onlymake a modest contribution to improving thesegment’s economic situation and run therisk of causing distortions in other areas.

55Development and
significance of
education expenditure
in GermanyYoung people’s education and further
education opportunities play a keyrole in Germany’s future economic out-look. The public sector is responsiblefor the largest portion of educationexpenditure, although enterprises andprivate organisations also contributefinancially. After Germany’s poor per-formance in the PISA comparativestudy initiated by the OECD, the effect-iveness of the education system hasbeen attracting increasing public at-tention. Frequent calls are being madefor the government to increase itsspending on education. Given thepresent very high government expend-iture ratio and budget deficits in Ger-many, the only way to do so wouldbe by restructuring expenditure. Theresults of the PISA study and furtheranalyses indicate that the connectionbetween the level of education spend-ing and the performance of school-children and students is not as close asis often assumed. Hence it is probablyjust as important to make the educa-tion system more efficient. Further-more, demographic trends showing anupcoming decline in the number ofschoolchildren will provide relief forthe education system. This article re-views education spending in light ofthese issues.
Compared with education systems in other
countries, an important characteristic of edu-cation in Germany is the fact that it offers adual system of vocational education and

56training in industry and schools. Mainly as a
result of this approach, over 80% of 25 to64-year-olds in Germany have a qualificationwhich is higher than the compulsory schoolleaving certificate. In this sense, Germanyranks as one of the front runners when com-pared with other countries. However, figuresshowing the spread of qualifications in the25 to 34 age group are somewhat lessfavourable. Nevertheless, on the whole thedual training system is considered to giveGerman workers a good professional ground-ing – clearly a factor in Germany’s favour interms of its international competitiveness.
However, frequent criticism has been voiced
during the last few years of the quality of theeducation provided in Germany. For example,there have been recurrent complaints abouteducational deficiencies among school leav-ers, particularly from employers. Fairly recent-ly, international comparisons of schoolchil-dren’s performance have been carried out inwhich Germany has taken part. The TIMSstudy of mathematical and scientific literacy
1
had already uncovered the first weaknesses.Then, however, came Germany’s alarmingperformance in the PISA study carried out inspring 2000.
2The target group in this study
comprised 15-year-olds, who in many coun-tries were already in their final year of com-pulsory schooling. A series of questions wasused to provide an in-depth assessment oftheir reading ability and their mathematicaland scientific literacy. Of the 32 participatingcountries, Germany only achieved a place inthe lower half of the league table, althoughthere were considerable differences from onefederal state to another. Alongside the pooraverage result for German schoolchildren, the
wide dispersion of attainment was particular-ly striking; in no other country was it as sharp-ly pronounced. One implication is that a verylarge proportion (around one-fifth) of school-children failed to meet the requirements ofthe second of five performance levels andthey therefore have to be rated as a riskgroup with respect to further career pro-gression. The children’s family backgroundsproved to have a particular bearing onperformance. In addition to youngsters fromimmigrant families, children from socio-economic groups which put relatively littleemphasis on education also fared well belowaverage.
The subsequent PIRLS study, which examines
reading ability at the end of primary school,
3
produced more favourable results for Germanschoolchildren. Whereas average achieve-ment was in the top third among the partici-pating countries (which were not quite thesame as for the PISA study) the dispersion re-mained narrow. The children’s backgroundswere also less significant. Although this evi-dence put some results of the PISA study intoperspective, an improvement in the educationsystem in Germany would nonetheless ap-

57pear to be urgently needed, even if the results
suggest that rather more attention needs tobe focused on secondary education.
Apart from the quality of the education pro-
vided, the low level of take-up in tertiary edu-cation is also criticised. In line with other an-alyses, the OECD studies indicate that thenumber of tertiary level students in Germanyis well below average. The main response hasbeen to call for university admission in Ger-many to be made easier and, at the sametime, broadened in order to secure Germany’slong-term position in the global economy.However, it must be borne in mind that – notleast because of the dual training system –there are extensive education opportunities inGermany outside the realm of universities.Given the educational deficiencies of manystudents bemoaned by university lecturers,the high drop-out rates and the relatively lateentry into employment, any broadening ofadmission to tertiary education also requiresbetter preparation in schools and improve-ments to the educational services provided byuniversities.
The weaknesses and criticisms referred to
above have also led to demands for increasedgovernment spending on education. How-ever, the way to achieve education resultswhich compare more favourably with thoseof other countries is clearly likely to be morecomplicated than that. Nonetheless, it is gen-erally agreed that ensuring educational per-formance or rather establishing the under-lying conditions conducive to a successfuleducation system is one of the key functionsof the public sector. This will not only pro-mote equal opportunities in society but also
improve the conditions for achieving growth.
Total education expenditure in Germany
Measuring the level of spending on education
proves to be a complicated task. We firstneed to clarify what we understand by theterm “education”. Usually, nursery schoolsare included, even though in Germany theireducational task is minimal. In the case ofuniversities, at least expenditure by medicalfacilities on treating patients is excluded fromthe figures. However, there is no generallyaccepted classification of funds made avail-able for research and development. Differentmethods are also used to record expenditureon in-service and advanced training andfunds provided by the public sector to covertrainees’ living costs.
The definition of “expenditure” also varies.
For instance, in the frequently used netted ex-penditure concept, funds raised from theprivate sector specifically for educational pur-poses are deducted from public spending. Inthe financial statistics, which are frequentlytaken as a basis, payments made to healthcare and pension schemes for teachers inwestern Germany, most of whom are civilservants, are not classified under the relevantarea but instead recorded separately. To gaina comprehensive view of the strains that edu-cation policy places on the budget in anygiven year, account needs to be taken of thereclassifications and surcharges for notionalcontributions to pension insurance schemes.

58The broadest national measurement concept
is the education budget as published regularlyby the Federal Statistical Office.
4Two distinct
analyses are provided: one based on imple-mentation and the other on financing. Theimplementation analysis shows the volume offunds spent on each part of the educationsystem, whereas the financing analysis alsoclassifies the money according to its origin (iewhether it comes from the public or the pri-vate sector, or from abroad). Implementationfigures are currently available up to 2001;data on the origin of funds go as far as 2000only.
In 2001, education spending classified accord-
ing to this measurement concept amountedto3132 billion or 6.4% of GDP . Most of the
funds (as shown in the above chart) werespent on state schools (3.3% of GDP) and the
private school system (0.5% of GDP) includ-ing pre-schools and higher education institu-tions.
5Job-related expenditure defrayed as
part of in-service training was also significant(1.2% of GDP). The remainder comprised (asshown in detail in the table on page 59)assistance for people in full-time education(eg Federal Government educational scholar-ships and bursaries and funds to cover livingcosts paid by the Federal Labour Office), childbenefit for 19 to 25-year-olds still in educa-tion, and other education spending.
Although since 1995 – the first year for
which data according to the measurementconcept currently in use were available – edu-cation spending has risen by 312 billion or an
annual average of 1
1/C252%, its ratio to GDP has
gone down slightly by 0.2 percentage point.The main reason for this was a decline of0.3 percentage point in state pre-school andgeneral school education, whereas the overallnumber of people in full-time education in-creased. The ratio of the remaining “educa-tion segments” to GDP remained more or lessconstant.

4It also includes further education and training, educa-
tion-related spending by the Federal Labour Office, rele-
vant expenditure as part of assistance for young people,
spending on learning materials by private individuals, and
public sector expenditure for students’ living costs. Civil
servants’ wages are topped up by health care assistance
as well as notional contributions to the statutory pension
insurance scheme and the supplementary pension funds

60quarters) to the total education budget in
2000. Financing from the private sector waspredominant almost solely in the area of in-service training. Even in the case of theprivate education establishments, the publicsector still bore almost two-thirds of the costsincurred.
In 2000 state government, which is respon-
sible for the most important cost item, ie theteaching staff, provided almost two-thirds ofthe public sector resources. In the core areaof nursery schools, schools and higher educa-tion institutions, its share actually amountedto four-fifths. Local government accountedfor almost one-fifth of public sector resourcesin the education budget. The largest itemcomprised resources spent on ongoing build-ing maintenance and invested in schools. An-other key municipal focus is on pre-school
establishments. Central government expend-iture, which accounted for just under one-sixth of all public sector funds, is concen-trated on other educational institutions –which offer courses financed through theFederal Labour Office – and scholarships andbursaries, to which the Federal Governmentcontributed almost two-thirds.
Longer-term trends
To analyse longer-term developments, a nar-
rower definition than that used for educationbudget figures (ie in accordance with thefinancial statistics) needs to be adopted; es-sentially, this definition includes schools anduniversities.
6The long-term development of
spending on schools is markedly affected bydeclining birth rates. Data on universities indi-cate that a smaller proportion of funds hasbeen allocated to this sector as time hasgone on. Overall, the ratio of expenditure forschools and universities to GDP as defined inthis concept went down from 4.2% in 1975(former West Germany) to 3.2% in 2001(Germany as a whole).
The ratio of expenditure for general and
vocational schools to GDP fell from 3.1% in1975 to 2.2% in 1990. This decline wasmainly attributable to the sharp decrease inthe number of schoolchildren during thisTotal volume

61period. Starting from 8.6 million in 1960,
the number of schoolchildren in what wasthen West Germany had peaked at just over12 million by the mid-1970s, resulting in asharp increase in education expenditure. Inthe following period, the decline in the birthrate ceased to be offset by the only moderateincrease in the number of children attendingsecondary schools, and by the end of the1980s there were only 9 million schoolchil-dren. Adjusted for the decline in the numberof schoolchildren, expenditure on schools hadgone down only marginally to 2.9% of GDPby 1990.
Following German unification, the unadjust-
ed ratio to GDP of public sector funds allo-cated to schools went up again to 2.5% in1995. This was also due to a perceptible risein the number of schoolchildren in westernGermany to just under 9
1/C252million. During
this period, the offspring of the early 1960sbaby boom generation reached compulsoryschool age. There was initially a sharp in-crease in the number of schoolchildren ineastern Germany, too, where, in addition, therestructuring of the education system is likelyto have led to a higher number of peoplein full-time education. Overall, during thisperiod the number of schoolchildren in-creased decidedly more sharply than the ratioof education expenditure to GDP .
Since the mid-1990s, there has been a further
slight decrease in the ratio of public sector ex-penditure on schools to GDP . It has beenaround 2.3% since 1998. The main reasonfor this was that the decline in the birthrate in eastern Germany after reunificationslowed the number of admissions to schools
in that part of the country from 1996 on-wards. By 2001 the peak figure of just overthree million schoolchildren in 1996 had de-creased by one-fifth; this mainly affected theprimary level initially and resulted in a sizeableneed for adjustment in this area. By contrast,in western Germany the number of school-children continued to go up, meaning thatfigures for Germany as a whole showed afurther slight increase.
The developments outlined above also had a
considerable impact on the labour market forteachers, who account for the bulk of spend-ing on education. Whereas measures hadpreviously been taken to provide for a sharpincrease in the number of teachers, the early1980s saw a very sharp decline in the numberAs a percentage of GDP

62of new staff appointed to state schools (as
shown in the above chart). Hence, in 1988,for example, just over 6,500 teachers wereappointed, ie four-fifths fewer than in 1980.Since the number of teacher training gradu-ates decreased more slowly, by computationonly two-fifths of the graduates found teach-ing jobs in state schools between 1983 and1988. Between 1991 and 1998, the numberof appointments stabilised at around 15,000,subsequently leaping to almost 31,000 in2001. Only a fairly small part of this rise is at-tributable to the new positions created inresponse to the increase in the number ofschoolchildren in many western Germanstates. A more significant factor is the needfor new teachers to replace those retiringfrom the profession. Following the wave ofappointments in the 1970s, this need has be-come greater and will remain sizeable for
some years to come. In 2001 more thantwice as many teachers as in 1993 (nearly16,000) entered retirement. In the past fewyears, the increase in the number of part-timeteaching jobs has also heightened the needto appoint more teachers; this does not, how-ever, imply an expansion of capacity. Aftermany years of high levels of unemploymentamong teachers, the evident need to appointnew staff may even lead to teacher shortagesin the next few years.
Although there has been a nominally sharp
increase in the funds made available for ter-tiary education since 1975, the ratio of thesefunds to GDP went down from 1.1% to0.9% in 2001. The number of students morethan doubled during this period from justover 0.8 million to almost 1.9 million. Linkingthe development of tertiary education re-sources to the number of registered studentsis, however, of only limited informationalvalue. For instance, the picture may be dis-torted if there is an above-average increase inthe number of long-term students who donot actually attend classes but claim otherbenefits to which registered students are en-titled.

ences between courses of study, the restric-tion on the number of students admitted to“expensive” subjects, such as medicine, com-bined with the large numbers of additionalstudents enrolling for cheaper subjects is alsoLog scale

63likely to have resulted in a reduction in the
average amount of funds required. Further-more, spending on research (which is unre-lated to the number of students) is includedin tertiary sector spending.
Apart from the long-term trend, the finan-
cial statistics also provide some insight intothe different types of expenditure whichconstitute spending on schools and highereducation institutions (see adjacent chart). Inthe total volume of expenditure amountingto367 billion (excluding additional notional
contributions for civil servants’ old-age pen-sion provision) in 2000, the largest portion– 65% – comprised compensation of employ-ees. In the school sector, this portion waseven distinctly higher (74%). Contributionsfor other operating expenditure and pay-ments to other educational sectors, whichwere primarily used to finance staff and otheroperating costs of private and outsourcedfacilities, amounted to 14% and 12% re-spectively. Only 9% was allocated to invest-ment – in buildings in particular.
This shows, for example, that it is difficult to
measure the quality of government spending,in terms of its influence on macroeconomicgrowth, solely by the share of investment ex-penditure. It is at least questionable whethera large part of the expenditure classified inthe budget as investment actually promoteseconomic growth. This applies, for instance,to general government participating interests,loans and investment grants – which oftentend to be subsidies and distort the allocationof private resources – as well as to investmentin what are termed consumption assets.
8Onthe other hand, a sizeable proportion of cur-
rent public sector expenditure, particularly atstate government level, represents invest-ment in human capital, which is a key factorin longer-term economic growth.

64proaches presented in this article.10Moreover,
as the measurement concept has beendeveloped further in recent years, only limitedconclusions can be drawn from a comparisonwith previous years. Furthermore, the infor-mational value of the data from the OECD islimited not least by the fact that educationsystems are organised differently in each indi-vidual country and that recording practicesmay well differ from one country to an-other.
11Above all, it should be borne in mind
that comparing the level of expenditure toGDP alone merely allows very limited conclu-sions to be drawn as to the actual educationalprovision. The informational value is not leastrestricted by the varying levels of teachers’pay and the divergent proportions of thepopulation of the normal age to be in full-time education.
Overall, according to the OECD method,
spending on education facilities in Germanyamounted to 5.3% of GDP in 2000. Thisundershot the 1995 level by
1/C252percentage
point. Thus, spending on education in Ger-many in 2000 was below the OECD countryaverage by around 0.1% of GDP . Funds pro-vided by general government amounted to4.3% of GDP , ie remained
1/C252percentage
point below the international average. In Ger-many an above-average share of educationexpenditure thus comes from the private sec-tor. This is mainly attributable to the well-developed dual system of vocational educa-tion and training since the companies in-volved assume the costs of the trainees’practical tuition.This particular feature is also reflected in how
expenditure is apportioned to the specificeducational levels.
12These figures reveal clear
international differences in the educationfocus. In Germany, for instance, spendingat the elementary level (including nurseryschools classified as educational institutions)amounts to 0.6% of GDP , well above theOECD average; this is mainly related to thefact that a significant proportion of expend-iture (one-third) is not covered by public sec-tor funds. By contrast, a relatively low figure(2.1%) was recorded for the primary andlower secondary levels, which are almost ex-clusively government financed. However, atthe upper secondary level, which also in-cludes technical and vocational schools, thefigure for Germany was back in line with theaverage of the OECD countries (1.4% ofGDP); this was due to the relatively highfinancial contribution made by the privatesector. At the tertiary level, comprising uni-versities in particular, expenditure in 2000amounted to 1.0% of GDP , compared withan average of 1.3% of GDP in OECD coun-tries.
This kind of expenditure comparison admit-
tedly takes no account of major differences inthe key factors affecting the demand for edu-
10Most importantly, expenditure on further education
and training and as part of the work promotion measures
carried out by the Federal Labour Office is not taken into
consideration. However, resources allocated by higher
education institutions to research and development are
included in education expenditure.
11For instance, expenditure on schools is far higher if
child supervision and catering services are offered in add-
ition to education.
12Admittedly, there are difficulties involved in apportion-
ing the funds to the different levels of education. For ex-
ample, many schools in Germany cover several different
educational levels.Comparison

65cation. First, the proportion of people who
are of the normal age to be in full-time edu-cation is a key consideration; in the OECDstudy, this age range has been defined asbeing from 5 to 29. In 1999 the figure forGermany was one-sixth below the average inthe OECD countries.
13The number of people
in this age range who wish to continue theirstudies after completing compulsory school-ing is also a prime factor. Whereas Germanyexceeds the benchmark at the school level, itis lagging well behind at the tertiary level. In2001, 32% of one age group in Germanystarted tertiary-level courses lasting at leastthree years, whereas the average OECD fig-ure was 47%.
More enlightening information about educa-
tion expenditure by international comparisoncan therefore be derived from the ratio of ex-penditure to the number of schoolchildrenand students. The relevant OECD figures aregiven in US dollars adjusted for purchasingpower.
14In 2000, average expenditure per
schoolchild or student across all levels wasaround US$6,850 in Germany (see adjacentchart). This figure was well above the OECDcountries’ average funds of just underUS$5,750. This lead is, however, largely at-tributable to the above-average role of theprivate sector in the financing of, first, voca-tional training, but also of pre-school facil-ities. However, government spending stillamounted to just over US$5,550 per school-child, compared with US$5,100 across allOECD countries. Admittedly, this relates notleast to the fact that, by international stand-ards, salaries for teaching staff in Germanyare relatively high.The picture varies widely across the different
educational levels. For instance, at the elem-entary level (for children aged three and overwho are not yet of compulsory school age)almost US$5,150 is spent per child, ie farmore than the OECD average of just underUS$4,150. The difference is almost entirelydue to the fact that far more than the aver-age share of funds does not come from thepublic sector (attendance fees and funds pro-vided by churches or outsourced municipalcompanies which run establishments of thiskind).US dollars, purchasing power adjusted

66By contrast, at the primary level, which com-
prises the first four to six schools years, Ger-many spends US$4,200 on each schoolchild,ie 4% less than the OECD average. If thepupil-teacher ratio is used to measure thelevel of individual attention, the OECDaverage in 2001 was one teacher for every17 pupils, whereas in Germany the figurewas one teacher for 19.4 pupils. In addition,the allocation of just over 640 teaching hoursin the 2001 primary school timetable forchildren aged between seven and eight was14% below the average across all countries.
At the lower secondary level, spending in
Germany (US$5,470 per pupil) was alsobelow average, although somewhat less thanat the primary level. This was also reflected inthe pupil-teacher ratio (15.7 compared withthe OECD average of 14.5). On the otherhand, spending per upper secondary levelpupil – which, in addition to grammar schoolclasses also comprises vocational schools andin-service training – amounted to just underUS$9,630, nearly 60% above the average.Apart from the impact of teachers’ salaries,this result was also largely due to the highlevel of the private sector financial contribu-tion to Germany’s dual training system.
The OECD figures for the tertiary level, which
comprises all higher education institutions, in-dicate that funding in Germany is rathergood. However, particular caution should beexercised when assessing the situation be-cause expenditure is relatively closely linkedto the course of study chosen and the OECDanalysis also includes spending on researchand development. Given the fact that theshare of this kind of expenditure is well above
average, spending on German higher educa-tion institutions was US$10,900 per studentin 2000; this exceeded the OECD average bymore than US$1,300. However, if spendingon research is excluded, the benchmarkwould have been slightly undershot. Germanhigher education institutions recorded a ratioof students to teaching staff of 12.3 in 2001,ie better than the OECD average (16.5),whereas the average period of study was4.9 years – just over half a year longer.
Conclusions
Mainly as a result of the poor performance of
German schoolchildren in the PISA study,greater attention is now being paid to theeducation system in Germany. Given the keysignificance of investing in human capital interms of economic growth, education spend-ing is actually one of the most importantcomponents of public sector expenditure. Animprovement in the educational results is notat odds with efforts to consolidate the gen-eral government budget by reducing the ratioof overall government spending to GDP . Pri-marily, advantage should be taken, whereappropriate, of the possibility of releasingadditional funds by restructuring expenditure.Comparative international studies show thatmerely increasing education expenditure doesnot necessarily lead to an improvement ineducational achievement. Although school-children in a country which spends more oneducation do perform better on the whole,differences in the volume of expenditure goonly a limited way towards explaining the

67divergence in attainment levels. The impact
on educational performance of other vari-ables, such as class size and the number ofteaching hours, also remains limited. A com-parative study even considers the conclusion“that political design parameters which haveso far been considered important haveproved to be relatively meaningless in termsof the development of performance”.
15
It should also be borne in mind that the per-sistently low birth rate will lead to a signifi-cant decline in the total number of school-children in Germany over the next few years.According to the medium variant of the mostrecent projected population figures,
16the
number of children and young people under20 years of age in Germany will declineby 10% to 15.5 million between 2001 and2010. In the subsequent ten years, there willbe a further decrease of just over 6%. Theratio of children and young people to theworking age population (for the sake of sim-plicity, defined here as people aged between20 and 65) will go down from 34% in 2001to just over 30% in 2010 and to 29% in2020. This means relief for the education sys-tem, but also has implications for staffing pol-icies in this sector. Although retraining andadvanced training are likely to require add-itional funding, this largely affects the privatesector.
Encouraging competition among different
schools and universities will also help toenhance the quality of education. Inter-national comparisons suggest that this has apositive impact. Setting comparable perform-ance standards and conducting evaluations,the results of which are subsequently pub-
lished, evidently play a key role.
17Allowing
people greater freedom in the choice ofschools and furnishing the institutions withsuitable incentive mechanisms is likely to pro-mote “competition for quality”. Structural re-forms combined with the decline in the num-ber of schoolchildren could free up resourceswhich could be used, for example, to coverthe additional financing needed to meet thefrequent demand for an expansion of all-dayschooling and to provide extra assistance forunder-achieving pupils.
The OECD studies also have prompted calls
for a deliberate increase in the number of stu-dents in higher education. However, consid-eration needs to be given to the relativisingeffect of the generally broader system of vo-cational education on, by international stand-ards, the well below-average number of first-year students among youngsters of the sameage in Germany. We do not, at present, haveany figures which have been adjusted to takethis into account. Furthermore, there has al-ready been a marked increase in the numberof first-year students in the past few years.This may have been partly the result of theintroduction of new short-term courses ofstudy leading to a so-called “Bachelor” de-gree.

68Given the strained government budgetary
position, the quality of education may wellalso be maintained or improved by makingstudents bear a greater portion of the cost oftheir education, which is at present almostfree. Since a university education usuallyreaps considerable rewards,
18increased cost-
sharing would seem particularly acceptableprovided that accompanying scholarship pro-
grammes ensure that university studies arenot jeopardised for lack of funds. Couplinggreater autonomy with residual fees wouldenhance competition among universities.
