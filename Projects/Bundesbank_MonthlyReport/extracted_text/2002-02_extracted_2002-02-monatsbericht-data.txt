6The international
and EuropeansettingDevelopments in the world economy
The world economy remained weak in the
final quarter of 2001. The advanced econ-omies saw a further fall in their industrial pro-duction, and in many places unemploymentcontinued to rise. However, signs of a gradualstabilisation of the world economic situationhave now also appeared. In the world’s twolargest economic zones, North America andwestern Europe, the expectation componentsof major indicators of sentiment have recentlybrightened noticeably. In the United Statesnew orders for durable goods tended up-wards in December 2001. Since reaching alow point in September immediately after theterrorist attacks, equity markets have likewiserecovered visibly. However, they have re-mained fairly prone to disruptions through-out, largely as a result of the spectacular col-lapse of some US companies.
According to initial calculations, overall eco-
nomic production in the United States did notgo down any further in the autumn of 2001 –contrary to general expectations. However,this result was strongly influenced by specialfactors that will be discussed below. The con-tractionary tendencies now seem to have dis-sipated. In the euro area, for which no suchrecent data on GDP are yet available, indus-trial production in December seems to haverecovered after tumbling in the two preced-ing months. In addition, households’ demandfor consumer goods has held quite firm onboth sides of the North Atlantic so far; insome countries, it has even risen visibly. Thatis remarkable in the light of losses in asset val-ues associated with the corrections in stockFirst signs that

7market prices since the spring of 2000 and
the mostly visible rise in unemployment.
In addition, important conditions for a cyclical
recovery have improved considerably over thepast few months. Oil prices have stabilised ata relatively low level, strengthening con-sumers’ purchasing power and taking pres-sure off companies’ costs. The depletion ofinventories has made further progress. Inboth North America and western Europeinterest rates are relatively low although cap-ital market yields have picked up, buoyed byexpectations of a cyclical turnaround. More-over, fiscal policy in the United States hasbeen stimulating economic growth. Besidesthe tax reform introduced in 2001, othermeasures worth mentioning include those tosupport the economic sectors hit hardest bythe 11 September terrorist attacks and thoseto strengthen domestic and external security.Fiscal policy in the euro area, which still hasto take considerable consolidation require-ments into account, is stabilising the econ-omy by accepting cyclically induced budgetdeficits. In addition, the political risks whichhad severely strained the general economicclimate owing to the events of 11 September2001 are now being assessed as less grave.On the whole, a number of cyclical indicatorsand the more favourable environment arethus lending support to the prevailing fore-cast that expansionary forces will regain theupper hand in the spring. Especially as a resultof the lower level of output at the end of2001, however, this is not likely to have a per-ceptible impact on the annual averagegrowth of global gross domestic product(GDP) for 2002. The December forecast ofthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) says
that world economic growth, at 2.4%, willnot be any higher than in 2001, and that theexpansion in real world trade will rise to nomore than 2.2%.
These recognisable positive signals should not
blind us to the risks that continue to exist,particularly those threatening the corporatesector. It is therefore still difficult to say towhat extent the overcapacities created duringthe boom in the late 1990s, especially in theUS information and communication tech-nologies (ICT) sector, have either already beenreduced or can still be put to economic use. Alastingly high or rising net investment ratiocan be expected only if the economy eitherfollows a steeper growth path or shifts to ahigher trend rate. This is closely linked to the

8future importance of the new economy not
only to the US economy but also to the restof the world. If it turns out that the high ex-pectations associated with the new economywhich emerged in the late 1990s need to befurther adjusted downwards and that the in-vestment-stimulating decline in the relativeprices of capital goods recedes, the commer-cial sector’s propensity to invest, despite mon-etary stimuli which have at times been con-siderable, could be revived less quickly andless powerfully than many forecasters are cur-rently expecting.
Moreover, there are considerable weak links
in the world economy. Argentina is in themiddle of a major economic contraction pro-cess triggered by the financial crisis with noend in sight. As seen from today’s perspec-tive, however, the risk of contagion effectsspilling over to other emerging economies ingeneral and to Argentina’s Latin Americanneighbours in particular seems to be limited.This is indicated by the fact that this crisis islargely “home-made” and has been loomingon the horizon for quite some time. Financialmarkets have reacted reasonably to the Ar-gentine government’s moratorium on debtservice payments.
The persistently critical state of the Japanese
economy is extremely worrisome. Japan isgrappling with a battered financial system, abloated government deficit and deflationarytendencies. Even if it is possible to avoid fur-ther destabilisation, Japan will probably notmake any contribution to world economic re-covery but instead will once again act as abrake on economic growth, particularly ineast Asia. According to the IMF forecast,
overall production in 2002 will shrink by 1%,a larger decline than in the preceding year(-
12%).
In the third quarter of 2001 seasonally adjust-
ed real GDP in Japan continued to slide; itwas down
12% from both the preceding peri-
od’s level and that of the same time a year be-fore. In the last quarter of the year the un-favourable overall economic developmentseems to have continued. Industrial produc-tion went down by a seasonally adjusted2
12%, a year-on-year decline of no less than
1212%. The number of unemployed persons
rose sharply during the last few months ofthe year, with the seasonally adjusted un-employment rate hitting an all-time high of5.6% in December. The weakness in demandhas hit all components of domestic demand;even government investment, which hadbeen expanded sharply at times during the1990s with the aim of stabilising the econ-omy, tended downwards in the autumn of2001. In October-November real exports didrise in the aggregate. However, this recoverywas partly linked to the short-lived boom inthe US car market – which will be explainedin greater depth below – and is unlikely tolast.
Consumer prices in January were 1.5% lower
than a year before; they have dropped byaround 3% since the autumn of 1998. Seenin isolation, real consumer purchasing powerhas increased. Viewed in a macroeconomiccontext, however, the drawbacks of mount-ing deflationary pressure weigh more heavilythan the advantages: consumer are encour-Problem

9aged to take a wait-and-see attitude, the real
debt burden rises and real factor prices goup. It is questionable whether the most re-cent depreciation of the yen – which willprobably lead to higher import prices – canstop this. For the above reasons, hopes forthe Japanese economy rest very much on arapid and strong recovery of the world econ-omy and particularly the US economy.
According to initial calculations overall US
economic output in the fourth quarter stag-nated at its previous year’s level after adjust-ment for seasonal and working-day vari-ations. The US economy grew at an annualaverage rate of 1.1% in 2001 compared with4.1% in each of the two preceding years.Owing to various expansionary special fac-tors, though, real GDP growth in the autumnof 2001 does not reflect the basic cyclicaltrend, which initially had still been pointingdownwards. Two factors particularly worthmentioning are that, firstly, major purchaseswere postponed following the events of11 September and, secondly, car sales wereencouraged by extremely attractive financingrates offered by major car manufacturers anddealers. They made a major contribution toraising household spending on durable goodsin the fourth quarter by 8
12% – at constant
prices and after seasonal adjustment – com-pared to the summer months when demandhad barely risen. Consequently, the growthrate of private consumption rose to slightlyless than 1
12% (seasonally adjusted). How-
ever, during the current quarter this stimuluswill either vanish entirely or, due to the ex-pected slump in the demand for cars, eventurn around and have an adverse impact. Thestrong growth in consumption was accom-
panied by a decline in households’ savingratio to
12%. Real general government ex-
penditure, which grew by well over 2% afterseasonal adjustment, also boosted domesticdemand. It was particularly supported by con-siderably greater spending on domestic andexternal security, which is likely to containpart of the cost of the military intervention inCentral Asia. As announced by Washington,government expenditure will become increas-ingly important in future.
On the whole, many signs indicate that the
economic slump persisted initially in the au-tumn; only towards the end of the year didbusiness sentiment seem to recover. The de-cline in industrial equipment expenditureworsened to 3
12% in the fourth quarter, sea-
sonally adjusted, and to over 9% on the year.Investment in housebuilding also declined inseasonally adjusted terms. In the last quarterof 2001 the depletion of inventories was es-pecially pronounced; this was due in particu-lar to the aforementioned sales campaignsconducted by car manufacturers. Real exportslikewise went down, though no longer assharply as in the summer. The declining trendin imports has flattened even further, causingthe real foreign balance to slide further intodeficit than in the preceding quarter.
The US labour market is currently showing a
mixed picture. In January 2002 the number ofemployed persons went down even further,falling 1.8% below its level at the turn of2000-2001, which marked the cyclical peak.Despite job shedding, the seasonally adjustedunemployment rate went down in January byUS GDP

100.2 percentage point to 5.6% since the la-
bour force was distinctly smaller than in De-cember. On the year, the rate of price in-creases declined from 3.7% in January 2001to 1.6% in December. Falling crude oil pricesplayed a major role in this development. Coreinflation, which represents price movementsexcluding energy and foods, was, at 2.7%,around the same level as at the beginning of2001, which meant it was still higher than inthe boom years of 1997-2000.
In 2001 the United Kingdom’s economy grew
by 2.4%, which was the highest rate ofgrowth among the G-7 countries. Themarked drop in industrial output was morethan offset by dynamic expansion in the ser-vices sector. It is also worth mentioning thatthe UK economy continued to grow at a rela-tively fast pace in the first three quarters oflast year even as the economy in importantpartner nations was already beginning tofade noticeably. According to initial calcula-tions, though, real quarter-on-quarter GDPgrowth in the final quarter was only
14% be-
cause the recession gripping the manufactur-ing industry had a stronger impact on theoverall economic result than in the past. Sinceits peak in August 2000 industrial output hasgone down by 6%. In the autumn unemploy-ment rose for the first time since early 1993.However, the standardised unemploymentrate of 5.2% was still rather low by inter-national standards. Despite the downturn inthe labour market, consumption remainedexceptionally lively throughout. The main rea-sons were probably the continued rise in thevalue of residential property and the fall inhomeowners’ repayments owing to decreas-ing mortgage lending rates. In the October-
December period retail turnover was no lessthan 6
12% up on the year. Consumer price
inflation (excluding mortgage lending rates)went up from 1.9% in December to 2.6% inJanuary; one of the reasons for this was thesharp rise in food prices owing to inclementweather.
Macroeconomic trends in the euro area
As in the second quarter, seasonally adjusted
overall economic output in the euro areacame to a virtual standstill in the third quarterof last year. Its year-on-year growth rate wentdown to 1.4%. Private consumption, havinggone up noticeably in the first half of theyear, hardly expanded any further after that,and the depletion of inventories was steppedup once again. These two factors caused do-mestic activity, in particular, to cool down fur-ther in the summer months. Weak domesticdemand dragged down the demand for im-ported goods and services. Exports, by con-trast, only decreased slightly during thatperiod. The positive change in net importsthus buttressed GDP growth in the third quar-ter and stabilised overall economic capacityutilisation.

The economic slowdown in the euro areacontinued in the autumn of 2001, accordingto information available so far. Industrial pro-duction continued to decrease in theOctober-December period, falling 1.7%

11below its third-quarter level and 3.7% on the
year. The fact that industrial capacity utilisa-tion likewise declined once again betweenOctober 2001 and January 2002 is consistentwith this picture. As of late, capacity utilisa-tion was at its lowest point since early 1997,also falling below its multiyear average. Allthe same, production capacity in industry isstill being utilised considerably better than inthe 1992-93 and 1996-97 periods duringwhich the economy was weak. In the last fewmonths of last year the economic slumpmade a relatively distinct impact on the la-bour market for the first time. In Decemberseasonally adjusted unemployment was8.5%, 0.1 percentage point higher than inthe summer. On average for 2001, 8.5% ofthe euro-area labour force was unemployed,as against 8.9% a year before.
Since the turn of 2001-2002, the euro area
has seen positive economic signals, too. Theindustrial confidence indicator showed a dis-tinct improvement in January following aslight improvement in December. In addition,the situation regarding new orders was con-sidered less unfavourably than in October,and export expectations have equally bright-ened up. Consumer confidence seems tohave stabilised at its depressed level of thepast autumn.
After seasonal fluctuations are factored out,
consumer prices rose in the last quarter of2001 by an annualised rate of only around1% from their level during the summermonths. That was considerably less than inthe preceding quarters. However, the year-on-year rise was still as much as 2.2%. Thelower overall rate was caused mainly by re-
ductions in the prices of sources of energyand decreasing food price rises. By contrast,the prices of industrial goods (excluding en-ergy) and services underwent a somewhatless favourable development than in the thirdquarter. Therefore the rate of price increase,excluding the volatile elements of energy andunprocessed foods, again went up slightly inthe third quarter to 2.4%. On average for2001 the Harmonised Index of ConsumerPrices (HICP) was up 2.6% on the year; ex-cluding energy and foods the rise was 2.2%.
In January of this year the rate of price in-
crease, according to initial – and provisional –“flash” estimates by Eurostat, went up by 0.4percentage point from December’s figures to2.5%. Increases in taxes and administrative

Euro-area current account and exchange-
rate developments
In the autumn of last year the unfavourable
state of the world economy and the palpableweakening of domestic demand put a visibledamper on turnover in the euro area’s foreigntrade. Whereas export activity remained virtu-ally unchanged well into the summer, exportsfrom the euro area have gone down sharplysince then. In the last three months for whichsuch information is available (September-November 2001) they were down 3
12%f r o m
the figure for the preceding three-monthperiod, in terms of value and after seasonaladjustment. In terms of their value, importsfell even further during that same period (bymore than 6%); part of that decline, how-ever, is probably due to lower import prices,especially for energy commodities. The euroarea’s export surplus thus continued to risedespite the discernible downturn in exportsduring the autumn; in the September-November period the euro area’s balance oftrade closed with a seasonally adjusted sur-plus of 323 billion, or just under 36 billion
more than in the preceding three-monthperiod (June-August 2001).That also caused the euro area’s current ac-
count to improve, especially since in the fieldof invisible current transactions with non-residents net expenditure, at 318
12billion,
was 3412billion lower than in the preceding
period. On the whole, the September-November period saw a surplus of 34
12bil-
lion, following a deficit of 3512billion in the
preceding three-month period.
The euro’s position in the foreign exchange
markets changed relatively little over the lastfew months of the past year and in the firstfew weeks of 2002. After temporarily stabilis-ing on several occasions, most recently fol-lowing the smooth introduction of eurobanknotes and coins at the beginning of thisyear, the euro was promptly forced to surren-der its gains. As usual, the euro’s rate againstthe US dollar was at the centre of the mar-kets’ attention. Once the market uncertaintytriggered by the 11 September terrorist at-tacks had died down somewhat, the euro’srate against the US dollar fluctuated untilmid-January in a relatively narrow band be-tween US$0.88 and US$0.91. The exchange-rate movements primarily reflected changingmarket assessments of the economic outlookfor the United States. At times, confidence inrapid economic recovery in the USA buoyedthe US dollar, as did the reduction in interestrates by the US Federal Reserve at the begin-ning of November. However, at the end ofNovember the US dollar again lost groundafter new figures painted a somewhat lessrosy picture of the state of the US economy.At year’s end, sentiment swung back in fa-vour of the US dollar when, following thepublication of unexpectedly positive earlyForeign tradeCurrent

13US economic indicators, the opinion increas-
ingly prevailed that the US economy had bot-tomed out. In the light of the smooth eurocash changeover, the euro temporarily re-covered at the beginning of 2002, making upsome of its previous losses. But by the secondhalf of January the euro had again lost sub-stantial ground; as this report went to press,the euro was being quoted at US$0.87.
The euro’s depreciation against the US dollar
was balanced out to a certain extent by itsgains against the Japanese yen, which slippeddramatically against all major currencies fol-lowing news that the Japanese economy’s re-cessionary trend in the third quarter of lastyear had continued. Vanishing prospects of aspeedy recovery of economic growth subse-quently caused the yen to lose more ground.Only towards the end of January did the yenrecover somewhat against the euro; as of latethe exchange rate was just under ¥116 to theeuro.
In contrast to the euro’s movements against
the yen, its rate against the pound sterling re-mained confined to a rather tight band be-tween £0.61 and £0.63 during the periodunder review. In November and Decemberthe euro gained temporarily against thepound sterling after the publication at the be-ginning of November of data on the unex-pectedly sharp drop in UK industrial produc-tion and the upcoming introduction of eurobanknotes and coins triggered speculationthat the UK would soon join EMU. Once newdata on the relatively robust economicgrowth in the UK was published, the euroagain declined against the pound sterling inJanuary. When this report went to press, the
exchange rate was £0.61 to the euro.

14prior to the terrorist attacks. This may come
as a surprise in the light of the economicslump, the impact of which was greater out-side the euro area than inside. However, itshows once again that currency market play-ers are guided not so much by the currentstate of the economy at a given moment asby subjective expectations and forecasts offuture opportunities for profit and growth inthe respective economic zones. Investors areapparently still largely sceptical of the euroarea’s flexibility and efficiency. The euro-areacountries could strengthen investors’ confi-dence in the euro area’s economic future bytackling or credibly continuing the structuralreforms necessary to foster growth in spite ofthe economic downturn. That is likely to be amajor boost to euro-area countries’ growth,especially since the euro’s exchange rate iscurrently at a relatively low level.
Monetary policy and financial markets
in the euro area
In the past few months the Governing Coun-
cil of the ECB has pursued a steady-as-she-goes interest-rate policy. Since the latestinterest-rate reduction on 8 November 2001the interest rates for the marginal refinancingfacility and the deposit facility have remainedunchanged at 4.25% and 2.25% respective-ly. Since then, main refinancing operationshave all been conducted as variable-rate ten-ders with a minimum bid rate of 3.25%. Themonetary and macroeconomic situation bothindicated that central bank interest rates didnot need to be changed. Although monetarygrowth has been strong in the past fewmonths, it has reflected a particularly pro-
nounced and in all likelihood temporary li-quidity preference on the part of investors,against the background of an economic andfinancial environment fraught with uncer-tainty. The sharp monetary growth is current-ly unlikely to be indicative of any major threatof inflation. However, the monetary situationwill need to be thoroughly analysed in themonths to come. The economic slump in theeuro area has continued, but there have beeninitial signs that economic activity is graduallyrecovering. It should not be associated withupside risks for price developments. Instead,the trend decline in inflation rates – albeitwith brief fluctuations – is predicted to con-tinue this year. Over the medium term, too,the price outlook remains favourable pro-vided wage moderation continues.
The forward rates in the shorter-term seg-
ment of the money market have changed lit-tle since mid-November. Longer-term quota-tions, though, have risen by about 20 basispoints since the turn of the year. The yieldcurve on the money market, which was stillflat in late autumn, has been pointing slightlyupwards since January. That means marketplayers are no longer expecting further reduc-tions in interest rates over the medium term.
At the turn of the year, the Eurosystem’s on-
going management of the money marketneeded to cope, in particular, with the enor-mous and unprecedented impact of the intro-duction of euro banknotes and coins on bankliquidity. The reduction in the volume ofbanknotes in circulation, which acceleratedas the year came to a close, was predictable

15with a fair degree of reliability, and its liquidity
effects could be offset almost immediatelysimply by properly adjusting the main ten-ders. From 1 January 2002, by contrast, itwas almost impossible to make short-termforecasts of the extent to which the volumeof banknotes in circulation would developover time. When a shortage of liquiditybegan to loom owing to the unexpectedlylarge volume of banknotes in circulation, theEurosystem executed liquidity-providingthree-day and one-day quick tenders on 4and 10 January, respectively, in order to en-able credit institutions to maintain their re-quired holdings in a relatively steady mannerand to curtail the volatility of Eonia. Whengauging main tender operations, the Euro-system additionally had to consider that thevalue of frontloaded euro notes and coinswas debited to the credit institutions with apredetermined time-lag: the full value wasdebited in three equal parts on 2 January,23 January and 30 January. Euro banknotes,which were included in the Eurosystem cen-tral banks’ financial statements on 2 Januarybut not yet invoiced, were matched by a cor-responding volume of non-interest-bearingEurosystem loans to banks until their valuewas completely debited at the end of January.In January the volumes of the main tendersdiverged sharply once again. Following asimilar development in November caused byspeculative underbidding, the Eurosystemsettled a one-week additional refinancing op-eration simultaneously with the regular maintender to realign the allotment amounts as at28 November. The gap between Eonia andthe marginal allotment rates at the minimumbid rate opened up temporarily in JanuaryDaily data

16owing to the uncertain liquidity development,
yet Eonia did not undergo any major fluctu-ations except at the end of the maintenanceperiods and, as usual, at the end of the year.
From November to January the autonomous
factors determining bank liquidity generated313.9 billion of net inflows to credit institu-
tions (see the adjacent table). This wascaused, inter alia , by the declining number of
banknotes denominated in legacy currenciesand the time-lag in debiting frontloaded eurocurrency to credit institutions’ accounts. Also,the reduction in general government depositswith the Eurosystem had an expansionary ef-fect. The reserve requirement, though, wentup by 32.6 billion. Owing to the decline in li-
quidity needs, the Eurosystem, on balance,reduced the volume of open-market transac-tions during the period under review.
Overall euro-area M3 expansion in the fourth
quarter of 2001 was about as strong as in thethird quarter, when M3 growth acceleratedowing to the events of 11 September, amongother reasons. In December, however, M3growth was rather muted owing to a sharpdecline in the volume of currency in circula-tion. Monetary developments in the fourthquarter of 2001 were once again marked byportfolio shifts. Low interest rates and thepersistently high level of uncertainty in busi-ness and the financial markets have con-tinued to promote the “parking” of funds inliquid and safe investment vehicles. At year’send, the year-on-year rise in M3 (adjusted fornegotiable financial instruments held by non-euro-area residents) was 8.0% comparedwith 6.8% at the end of September.

17October-December period the three-month
moving average of annual growth rates was7.8% as against 6.2% in the July-Septemberperiod. Given the aforementioned portfolioinfluences, the large increase in the moneystock does not indicate any risk of future in-flation, an assessment which is also evi-denced by the further decline in lending.However, ongoing monetary developmentsmust be monitored carefully in future.
Of the individual components of M3, cur-
rency in circulation went into a virtual free fallin the fourth quarter. As the introduction ofeuro banknotes and coins approached, it de-clined from its September level by 368.7 bil-
lion, or just over 22%. In numerous casescash holdings were probably shifted to over-night deposits, which, at 3148.7 billion, rose
sharply. On balance, seasonally adjusted M1increased only slightly; its end-of-Decemberlevel was 5.0% up on the year. Other short-term bank deposits again showed stronggrowth during the period under review.Against the background of falling interestrates, emphasis shifted from deposits with anagreed maturity of up to two years to de-posits with an agreed period of notice of upto three months. In addition, the latter prob-ably also benefited from the decline in cur-rency in circulation. Of the negotiable finan-cial instruments (which likewise rose percep-tibly), it was money market fund shares/unitswhich gained most in the fourth quarter;there were hardly any net sales of moneymarket paper and short-term bank debt se-curities.As the end of the year approached, lending
to the private sector continued to weaken.Lending by MFIs to individuals and enterpriseswas up 6.7% from its previous year’s level atthe end of December, as against 7.1% at theend of September. The major reason was thatloans to the private sector suffered a renewedsetback owing to the sluggishness of theeuro-area economy. Between October andDecember direct lending rose, on an annualbasis, by just over 4
12% compared with a
512% rise in the July-September period. In
the fourth quarter, MFI loans to the publicsector were increased only within the scopewhich is usual for the season. By contrast, ex-tensive inflows of funds from outside theeuro area, particularly through portfolio in-vestment, continued to promote monetaryexpansion in the last quarter of 2001.

18low propensity of domestic investors to pur-
chase longer-term monetary assets had asimilar effect. Excluding capital and reserves,monetary capital held at MFIs increased by amere 3.5% last year.
Germany’s seasonally adjusted contribution
to euro-area M3 went back down after sea-sonal adjustment in the last quarter of 2001following strong growth during the earliercourse of the year. The other components of
the money stock did not rise enough tomatch the major reduction in the volume ofcurrency in circulation. Although overnightdeposits did increase rather sharply, as did ne-gotiable financial instruments (thanks to vi-brant demand for domestic money marketfund shares/units), the other short-term de-posits stagnated, on the whole. Over thecourse of the entire year, the German contri-bution to M3 rose by 6.1%.
Long-term capital market rates in the euro
area have been on the rise since late autumn,largely following the trend set by US interestrates. On a euro-area average, yields on ten-year government bonds were slightly over5% in mid-February, over
14percentage point
higher than in mid-November (434%). The
rise in yields on the European bond marketwas supported mainly by the expectation thatthe economic outlook, having become dismalfollowing the terrorist attacks in the USA,would soon brighten up. At the same time,market participants’ inflation expectations– gleaned from expert surveys and inflation-indexed bonds – remained moderate.
The yield spread between the capital market
and the money market widened during theperiod under review from 134 basis points to169 basis points as this report went to press.As a result of the ECB cut in interest rates on8 November 2001 and higher capital marketyields, this spread has widened noticeably inthe euro area.

19the future development of bond prices, has
remained relatively high. This has been re-flected in a noticeable increase in the impliedvolatility of options in the forward contractsof long-term (German) Federal bonds. As oflate, though, this volatility has receded slight-ly.
At the beginning of November 2001 yields on
ten-year euro-area government bonds, at lessthan 4
12%, hit their lowest level for the year;
comparable US Treasuries actually hit 414%.
Since then, they have largely developed inthe same direction. After the US Federal Re-serve lowered interest rates on 11 December,US yields rose slightly amid hopes that theUS economy would soon recover. Europeangovernment bond yields, though, did notfully match that move, causing the slightinterest-rate disadvantage of US bonds toturn into an interest-rate advantage on thepart of US Treasuries of up to
13percentage
point. Recently, however, European govern-ment bonds have again generated slightlyhigher yields (12 basis points) than US paper.
Risk premiums for corporate bonds with a
low credit rating,
2having gone up sharply in
September 2001, gradually receded again inthe winter months. This process was tempor-arily interrupted, however, by mounting con-cerns surrounding the accounting practices oflarge multinationals, in particular. Recently,the differential in risk premiums betweensuch bonds and (German) Federal bonds, atjust over 1
34percentage points, was around
half a percentage point lower than mid-November.The general price level in the euro-area equity
markets changed little on the whole over thepast few months, even though relativelyslight fluctuations did occur. As this reportwas going to press in mid-February, the DowJones EuroStoxx index was somewhat lowerthan in mid-November (-3%). Although thatenabled prices to maintain the distinct gainsMonthly data

20achieved since the end of September, it was
nowhere near enough to recoup the losseswhich had occurred even before the slumpprovoked by the 11 September terrorist at-tacks. Instead, the above-mentioned broadindex for the euro area fell by a total ofaround 20% throughout 2001. In mid-February European companies’ stock marketquotations were over one-third lower thantheir all-time highs of March 2000.
During the entire period under review, Euro-
pean stock exchanges were largely alignedwith the US stock market, where quotationslikewise tended to move sideways in view ofconcerns about corporate balance sheets, onthe one hand, and the increasingly en-trenched expectations of economic recovery,on the other. The stabilisation of stock priceswas accompanied by a slight decrease in mar-ket participants’ uncertainty regarding furthershare price movements. The implied volatilityof options on the Dow Jones EuroStoxx indexfell clearly below the very high levels that hadbeen reached following the Septemberslump; however, it remained visibly above the
average level in the first half of 2001.
Share price developments in euro-area equity
markets were supported only to a certain de-gree by the fundamentals during the periodunder review. The general value continues tobe below that of the past few years. How-ever, the average annual profits expected byanalysts for companies listed on the DowJones EuroStoxx index
3have once again been
scaled back noticeably for the winter months.The greater variation among analysts’ expect-ations also reveals increased uncertainty sur-rounding the continued profit outlook for list-ed companies. In addition, experts expect dis-tinctly more sluggish corporate profit growthnot only over the next few months but alsoover the longer term. Forecast annual growthfor the next three to five years has sunk from17
12% at the beginning of 2001 to just
under 1212%.

21Financial markets in
GermanyCapital market and bank interest rates
German capital market interest rates rose at
the turn of the year. Between mid-Novemberand mid-February the yield on ten-year Fed-eral bonds outstanding went up by just under
12percentage point to almost 5%. Interest
rates on Federal securities with a shorterresidual maturity – which are affectedmore strongly by expectations in the moneymarket – also increased in the same period byalmost
12percentage point. The interest rate
advantage of ten-year Federal bonds overone-year paper observable on the markettherefore remained virtually unchanged atjust over 1
14percentage points. The interest
rates for ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds) fellto 19 basis points below the average euro-area capital market rate, a slide of 6 points.Given the relatively strained public finances inGermany, the yield spread of ten-year bondsissued by domestic banks over comparableFederal bonds fell by 10 basis points to
14per-
centage point as well.
In recent months the yield curve shifted up-
wards across the whole maturity spectrum.Inflation expectations remained low – as ex-pert surveys show – and the increase in theyields on both short-term and long-term Fed-eral securities suggest that market players areagain taking a somewhat more favourableview of the economic outlook. This is also re-flected by the fact that the interest ratespread between bonds and money marketpaper is now more pronounced again. In linewith this, the increase in nominal yields wascarried over to real interest rates in the ten-year maturity range as expected by the mar-Rise in capital

than12percentage point up on November.
Between November and January short and
long-term bank interest rates diverged slightly.The banks raised their long-term rates in linewith capital market rates. After hitting a low inNovember, the cost of mortgage loans at a rateof interest locked in for ten years subsequentlyrose by around
14percentage point to 6.0%.
The effective interest rates for long-term fixed-rate loans to enterprises went up to 6.5% (fora credit volume of 3100,000 to less than
3500,000) and 6.2% (for a credit volume of
3500,000 to less than 35 million). Banks ini-
tially passed on only part of the early-Novembercut in central bank rates to their customers intheir short-term lending rates. In the monthsup to January, however, they made a furtherslight reduction in their interest rates, charging
8.4% for current account credit (for a creditvolume of 3500,000 to less than 32
12million),
10 basis points less than in November. Theinterest rate charged on personal credit lineswas also reduced marginally to an average of12.5% at the end of the period under review.At 2.7%, the interest paid on fixed-term de-posits with a one-month or a three-month ma-turity (for an investment volume of 350,000 to
less than 3500,000) was also reduced slightly
in January. The same was true of savings de-posits with a three-month period of notice.
Share prices
The rebound of prices in the German equity
market, which followed the sharp decline inthe wake of the 11 September attacks, didnot continue during the winter months. Al-though market participants apparently as-sumed that the economic situation wouldsoon recover, analysts’ profit forecasts, someof which were scaled down significantly, andconcerns about corporate insolvency bothweighed heavily on stock market quotations.Against this backdrop, trade turnover de-creased but there was generally only a slightchange in share prices. As measured on thebroad CDAX share price index, the quotationswhen this Monthly Report went to press
were virtually at the level reached in mid-November 2001. Compared with their historicalpeak in March 2000, German shares havetherefore still lost around 40% of their stockmarket value; this contrasts with a drop ofover one-third on the Dow Jones EuroStoxxshare price index.

23however, German equities have recovered
some ground by comparison with the Euro-pean average. The minor price fluctuations inthe period under review led to a decline inmarket players’ uncertainty about the futuredevelopment of German blue chips. The im-plied volatility on DAX futures contracts(VDAX), which had reached peak figures inSeptember, decreased further at the turn ofthe year.
Quotations on the Neuer Markt fell further,
following an especially strong recovery up tomid-November. In the past three months theNEMAX all-share price index fell by morethan 15%. Mid-cap stocks fared better. Hav-ing already proved more resistant during theslump, between mid-November and mid-February the share prices of enterprises listedon the MDAX demonstrated better growththan the market as a whole, showing a slightgain of 3%. In particular, the generally morefavourable valuation of these shares is likelyto have boosted their prices.
Borrowing in the securities markets
The amount of funds procured in the German
bond market in the fourth quarter of 2001was again rather low. Calculated at marketprices, gross sales of bonds and notes issuedby domestic borrowers, at 3213 billion, were
up on the previous quarter ( 3202 billion).
However, since redemptions and increases inissuers’ holdings of their own bonds were, onthe whole, considerably larger than in thepreceding period, net sales of domestic fixedinterest securities raised only 320 billion, asopposed to 336
12billion in the third quarter
of 2001. In 2001 as a whole, domesticborrowers raised fewer funds by issuingbonds ( 386
12billion) than in any of the
preceding ten years. Between October andDecember 2001 they sold only longer-termpaper with maturities of more than one year.However, the volume of domestic moneymarket paper outstanding fell by almost 35
billion, after having increased by 34 billion in
the previous quarter. Foreign issuers uppedtheir borrowing considerably compared withthe previous period – from 37
12billion net to
324 billion. They, too, sold longer-term debt
securities only, over half of which were de-nominated in euro. Overall, net sales of debtsecurities in the German bond market thuscame to 344 billion in the final quarter of
2001.Monthly averages

24The volume of funds raised by the sale of Ger-
man bonds largely benefited the public sec-tor. Public authorities raised 316 billion net
from the sale of their own bonds, roughly asmuch as in the previous quarter ( 315
12bil-
lion). The Federal Government accounted for38
12billion of this; the Land governments
increased their liabilities relating to fixed-interest securities by just under 38 billion. Be-
tween October and December 2001 Germancredit institutions issued proprietary bonds inthe amount of some 35 billion (net) only,
compared with 312
12billion between July
and September. Only the specialised credit in-stitutions achieved a positive sales result inthe fourth quarter, issuing 315 billion net
worth of debt securities ( 36 billion in the pre-
vious period). The net amount of publicPfandbriefe outstanding declined, however,by more than 36 billion; other bank debt se-
curities and mortgage Pfandbriefe were re-deemed on balance for 33
12billion and 312
billion, respectively. In the period under re-
view the banks further reduced their liabilitiesarising from short-term money market paper(-37
12billion). Having reached a record level
of3812billion net in the previous quarter,
the volume of corporate bonds outstandingfell by 31 billion.
Issuing activity in the German equity market
picked up only slightly in the last threemonths of 2001. Domestic enterprises placednew shares with a market value of 36 billion,
as opposed to 34
12billion in the third quar-
ter. This was accounted for solely by capitalincreases made predominantly by unlisted en-terprises; there has been no IPO businesssince last summer. The continued limited rais-ing of capital in the equity market was reflect-ed in the overall result for last year, which, at317
12billion, was the lowest since 1997.
Investment activity in the securities
markets
Domestic investors continued to invest heav-
ily in bonds and notes in the autumn months;their purchases amounted to 336 billion,
compared with 337 billion in the previous
quarter, and showed a particular preferencefor foreign bonds ( 321 billion). Their pur-
chases of domestic debt securities raised315
12billion on balance, whereas they had
added 333 billion worth of this kind of paper
to their portfolios in the previous quarter.They focused solely on public sector debt in-Investment activity in the German

ter of 2001 foreign investors also concen-trated primarily on purchasing bonds, addinga further 310 billion to their portfolios of do-
mestic debt securities (compared with 315
billion in the previous quarter). On balance,foreign investors purchased bank bonds only,with one major transaction between a Ger-man bank and one of its foreign branchesplaying a significant role (see page 45). Ger-man credit institutions ran down their hold-ings of bonds by a further 32 billion (com-
pared with - 38 billion in the previous quar-
ter). Although they purchased 33 billion net
worth of foreign bonds, they reduced theirholdings of domestic debt securities by 35
billion, selling bank debt securities ( 36 billion)
and corporate bonds ( 3
12billion) and pur-
chasing 3112billion worth of public bonds.
Domestic non-banks were the sole purchasers
on the German equity market in the fourthquarter. They added 37 billion net worth of
foreign and domestic equities ( 35 billion and
32 billion, respectively) to their portfolios.
Foreign investors sold German shares in theamount of 31 billion on balance, after having
topped up their holdings by 310 billion in the
summer months. Domestic banks were againselling, with sales totalling 32 billion, com-
pared with 316
12billion in the previous quar-
ter. Sales were solely of foreign equities(-34

In the final quarter of 2001, domestic collect-

the corresponding period in 2001 ( 32512bil-

eign investment fund certificates remainedunchanged in relation to those two referenceperiods. As is usual towards the end of theyear, a particularly large amount of funds,320

monetary financial institutions (MFIs)with domestic customers
Domestic customers again substantially in-
creased their overnight deposits with GermanMFIs in the fourth quarter of 2001. This wasfurthered by the continued low level of inter-est rates and the still high level of uncertaintyamong financial market investors. Moreover,in the run-up to the introduction of the eurobanknotes and coins, funds were rechan-nelled to these deposits from currency in cir-culation. Accordingly, employed personswere the main investors in overnight depositsheld by domestic MFIs. Contrary to the usualpractice in December, they did not run thesedeposits down at the end of the year, butincreased them perceptibly, presumablythrough inpayments of cash. Overall, over-night deposits of all domestic non-banks withGerman MFIs went up by 18.2% last year.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, de-
posits with an agreed maturity of up to twoyears were reduced appreciably in the finalquarter of 2001; in the earlier part of the yearsome of them had shown a marked increase.Contrary to what is otherwise customarypractice in December, households, in particu-lar, did not form any short-term time de-posits. Instead, they made fairly large-scalepurchases of domestic money market fundcertificates and increased their deposits withan agreed maturity of three months. The re-awakened interest of domestic investors inshort-term savings deposits can probably beexplained by the fact that interest rate cuts inrecent months had made the remunerationLending and deposits of monetary

27on these deposits more attractive than either
short-term time deposits or other types of de-posits. Owing to the introduction of eurobanknotes and coins, some cash was alsoprobably transferred to savings accounts.
Deposits with an agreed period of notice of
more than two years attracted little attentionin the fourth quarter of 2001 ( 31.0 billion,
compared with 32.4 billion in 2000). It was
not only among employed persons that re-straint was evident. Contrary to their usualpractice at this time of the year, domestic in-surance companies, which are traditionallythe most significant group of investors in thistype of deposit, in fact made a marked reduc-tion in their holdings of longer-term time de-posits with German MFIs. Deposits with anagreed period of notice of more than threemonths were also scaled down in the fourthquarter (- 32.7 billion); one year previously
they had been topped up by 34.9 billion. The
reversal is likely to be due to the fact that, atthe end of 2000, the interest rate advantageof longer-term savings deposits over short-term savings facilities attracting a higher rateof interest, which was still quite considerableat the end of 2000, was virtually halved in thecourse of 2001.
Seasonally adjusted lending by German MFIs
to the domestic private sector rose onlyslightly in the final quarter of 2001. More-over, on balance only securitised credit was is-sued; in particular, MFIs purchased large vol-umes of shares in domestic enterprises. Bycontrast, loans to the domestic private sectorstagnated overall as the sharp decline in De-cember fully offset the increase which hadtaken place in the previous two months.
Loans went up by 2.2% during 2001.
The currently limited dynamism of loans to
the private sector in Germany is reflected inthe borrowing behaviour of all the majorgroups of borrowers. In addition to housingloans, consumer borrowing was also reducedin the fourth quarter in seasonally adjustedterms. Conversely, enterprises increased theirloans from domestic MFIs slightly. The in-crease in lending was focused on energy andwater supply. By contrast, there was a furthercutback in loans to the manufacturing sector.Over the year as a whole this economic sectoralso marginally reduced its loans from Ger-man MFIs on balance; in 2000 these hadrisen perceptibly.

29Economic conditions
in GermanyUnderlying trends
The cyclical weakness of the German econ-
omy that had become apparent in the secondhalf of 2000 persisted during the last fewmonths of last year. In total, there was a no-ticeable decline in output. According to initialBundesbank calculations, real gross domesticproduct (GDP) – after eliminating seasonaland working-day variations – was around
14% below its level in the third quarter of
2001. This means that it was more or less justas high as in the same period of 2000, com-pared with a year-on-year increase of justunder
12% in the preceding quarter. The
overall situation in autumn 2001 also deteri-orated in terms of standard utilisation (whichdescribes the average degree of capacity util-isation achieved over the medium term). Onan annual average, real GDP increased by nomore than
12%, compared with 3% in 2000.
Nevertheless, the probability of a further de-
terioration in the economic situation is, if any-thing, slight at present. In fact, a number ofindicators point to the economy as a wholehaving stabilised at the turn of 2001-02. Also,major conditions for an economic revival dur-ing the course of this year are still in place.
The weakness in output in autumn was
centred on manufacturing: production wasbeing cut back further in response to slackerdemand, thus leading to a continuing slide inthe year-on-year figures. Foreign orders,which had reached record levels as recently asin 2000, were not the only ones to show atendency to decline in connection with theperceptible slowdown in international growthDecline in GDP

30and global trade. There was also a marked
fall-off in new orders from domestic custom-ers. The deterioration in manufacturing alsohad an impact on commercial services pro-viders. As the ZEW (Centre for European Eco-nomic Research) reports from its surveys,most branches of this sector – which includestax and business consultancy firms as well asfirms which rent out and lease motor vehiclesand those renting out and leasing machineryand equipment – rated business conditions in
the fourth quarter as showing a further de-terioration. Even IT firms, whose performancehad invariably been better than the averagepreviously, were viewing the position muchmore cautiously than earlier. The fact thatarchitects and planning offices also describedthe situation as unsatisfactory reflects thecontinuing process of adjustment in the con-struction sector. The orders position in con-struction remained very weak up to the endof the period under review, with output per-sisting at a low level towards the end of theyear.
Households’ consumption demand remained
quite subdued in the fourth quarter of 2001.As shown by the surveys of the consumer re-search institution GfK, there has been no im-provement in consumer sentiment so far – infact, it remains unfavourable on the whole.With regard to the economic outlook, in par-ticular, those surveyed were still cautious andeven their expectations about their own in-comes remained very pessimistic. This – to-gether with a gradual deterioration in thesituation on the labour market – is likely tohave been a factor in the willingness to buybeing weak. There were various reports of in-creased purchases owing to hoarded moneybeing released in connection with the intro-duction of euro banknotes and coins. Accord-ing to the official statistics on retail tradeturnover, however, this did not generate anymajor stimuli.
Recently, however, there have also been rec-
ognisable signs that the economic situation isgradually becoming more stable. Firstly, there

31Official price statistics versus anecdotal evidence
What does the official price statistics do?
The basic data for the official statistics are col-
lected on a widely dispersed regional basisthroughout the Federal Republic of Germany.Every month, price surveyors go into selected re-tail outlets in 190 reporting communities inorder to determine selling prices. The price an-alysis covers 750 goods and servíces. The individ-ual goods are described as precisely as possibleso that the prices relate to identical products inall cases. Each price surveyor fills in the reportsheet in accordance with fixed guidelines. Thecombination of price reporting units and the se-lection of goods produces a current monthlybasic pool of around 350,000 individual priceseries.
The goods and services included in the price anal-
ysis are selected on the basis of regularly recur-ring sample surveys of income and expenditure.These capture households’ records of all theirpurchases within one year. From this is derived arepresentative basket of goods and a sum of ex-penditure for the average of all households. Theimportance of the individual purchases is meas-ured by their percentage share of total expend-iture. In accordance with the weighting schemeof the consumer price index (CPI) with the baseyear 1995, roughly 10% each is spent on foodand energy, just over one-third is accounted forby purchases of manufactured goods (which in-clude cars, electrical appliances, clothing andbooks), and one-quarter is spent on acquiringservices. Rental payments account for the rest.
The “price question” in January 2002In January of this year, there were numerous re-
ports that many goods had become appreciablymore expensive. The “anecdotal evidence” wasfocused, in particular, on seasonal food productsand the restaurant and catering trade. Fresh let-tuce and peppers were said to have reachedquite “astronomical prices”. When the officialstatistics then reported that consumer prices hadrisen by less than 1% month-on-month, and that
the year-on-year rate of increase had gone up“only” from 1.7% to 2.1%, this finding did notseem to tally at all with consumers’ personal ex-perience.
It should be pointed out that the official statis-
tics has indeed also captured these personallyidentified price movements. According to the of-ficial records, prices of seasonal food products,for instance, were 12% higher in January thanthey had been at the end of 2001. Vegetablesalone, in fact, cost as much as 23% more, withprice increases of up to 75% being recorded fora head of lettuce. In restaurants, month-on-month price rises of 2% were ascertained, whichled to a year-on-year rate of price increase of al-most 4%.
What additionally has to be taken into consider-
ation, however, is that the price index also con-tains many other goods which have scarcelyrisen in price or have, in fact, become less expen-sive. For example, consumer electronics andphotographic appliances were somewhat cheap-er in January than they had been in December,and cars cost no more than before. Much less at-tention was directed at these prices, however.The general impression of prices is evidently in-fluenced more strongly by daily shopping thanby major ‘one-off’ purchases. Furthermore, theindividual consumer tends to focus more onlocal price developments, while the price indexwith its widely dispersed reporting communitiesmakes it possible to give a picture of prices na-tionally.
For all of these reasons, it can be justifiably be
assumed that the official price statistics has cor-rectly recorded price developments in January aswell. The large number of prices captured, thequalified personnel, and the plausibility checkscarried out at the Statistical Offices indicate thatthe overall outcome is representative and accur-ate.

32has been a visible improvement in manufac-
turing sentiment. Firstly according to the ifosurveys, enterprises’ expectations about fu-ture developments, in particular, are less pes-simistic than before, which means that therehas been no further deterioration in the busi-ness climate overall. Looking to the future,the financial services providers surveyed bythe ZEW were quite optimistic, although theirassessment is probably some way ahead ofreal developments. Secondly, the intake of
orders in the manufacturing sector wassomewhat better at the end of the periodunder review. Although the level of neworders remains unsatisfactory, the leading in-dicators suggest that the cyclical risks, whichhad been strongly accentuated earlier, havebecome less pressing.
Nevertheless, the enterprises’ earnings pos-
ition still leaves much to be desired. Cutbacksin output have led to a deterioration in prod-uctivity and an increase in unit labour costs.A rise in pay that overestimates the real scopefor income distribution would considerablyreduce the prospects of an economic revival.
The price climate had eased markedly at the
end of 2001. The year-on-year consumerprice rise, which is generally regarded as ayardstick of inflation, went down to 1.7% inNovember and December. In January, how-ever, there was a sharp increase in the generallevel of prices. The consumer price index forGermany showed a month-on-month rise ofalmost 1%. The year-on-year rate of increasewent up to 2.1%. It would be wrong, how-ever, to see this development solely or primar-ily as having a causal connection with theintroduction of euro cash. In fact, the pricerise was overwhelmingly due, firstly, toweather-induced crop failures in the case offruit and vegetables, and, secondly, to a num-ber of tax increases. Although instances ofthe euro having a price-raising impact canalso be ascertained, they are, on the whole,quite limited.Seasonally adjusted, quarterly

33Output and labour market
As mentioned above, there was a further
sharp cutback in manufacturing output in thelast few months of 2001. In the fourth quar-ter, it was a seasonally adjusted 2
14% down
on the preceding three-month period. Com-pared with the most recent peak in the firstquarter of 2001, this represented a reductionin output of around 5%. The year-on-yeardecline widened from 1% in summer to3
34% at the end of the period under review.
Firms in western Germany were more severe-
ly affected by this than the average. By con-trast, eastern German industry was able tohold its own well into the late summer and itwas only towards the end of the period underreview that slight shortfalls in productionwere sustained. Accordingly, the figure forthe fourth quarter of 2001 in eastern Ger-many was somewhat better than in the com-parable period of 2000, whereas productionin western Germany was 4% down on theyear. Among the major branches of industry,the durable goods sector in both western andeastern Germany felt the deterioration inbusiness activity most keenly, although capitalgoods producers sustained sharp reductions,too. While the motor vehicle sector held upquite well, there were dramatic cutbacks inthe ITC sector, which includes both computermanufacturers and producers of telecommu-nications equipment.
According to the ifo surveys, the utilisation of
operating capacities declined in seasonallyadjusted terms to around 82
12%i n
December 2001. This meant that, for the firsttime since the end of 1996, it was again
somewhat below the long-term average. Atthe same time, the cyclical situation led to adecline in the productivity of industrial labour– measured per employee, in particular, butalso per hour worked – and a clear increase inunit labour costs. This suggests that the con-ditions for earnings in the enterprises havebecome more difficult.Seasonally adjusted, quarterly

34The construction industry was still unable to
pull itself out of its trough in the last fewmonths of 2001.
1Construction output in the
fourth quarter persisted at a level that wasaround 7% down on the same period in2000. The situation in surface engineering,which is marked not least by persistentlyweak housing construction activity, remainedparticularly unfavourable. In undergroundconstruction engineering, the situation wassomewhat better. Local government con-
struction activity, which accounts for a majorpart of this sector, is suffering from a verytight budgetary position, but the cutbacks arenot as dramatic as those in the building in-dustry. The degree of capacity utilisation re-corded by the ifo institute, which had alreadyfallen to a very low level in summer, deterior-ated further at the end of 2001.
The cyclical weakness of the German econ-
omy has latterly been having a greater impacton the labour market. Employment, in par-ticular, which had shown comparatively littleresponse for an extended period, was cutback more sharply in autumn than before.According to the calculations of the FederalStatistical Office, the number of persons inwork fell in November to a seasonally adjust-ed 38.72 million. Year-on-year, this was a de-cline of 85,000 persons, or 0.2%. It was notonly the construction sector that made a fur-ther cutback in the number of persons it em-ployed. There was a major reduction inmanufacturing as well. Furthermore, the un-favourable development in business is likelyto have led to redundancies even in severalsectors of the services industry. Evidently, thescope that was available as a result of work-ing time accounts and more flexible workingarrangements, has now been largely exhaust-ed. This is also indicated by the greater usebeing made of short-time working. In mid-January 2002, no fewer than 210,000 per-sons were registered in work with shorterQuarterly

35working hours – almost 120,000 more than
12 months previously.
Movements on the labour market have also
been affected by changes in active measuresdesigned to support jobs and employment. InJanuary, for example, just under 200,000 per-sons were taking part in work-creationschemes, which was around 60,000 fewerthan 12 months previously. Vocational train-ing courses were still being attended by315,000 participants, which was a year-on-year decline of not quite 40,000. These fallswere partly offset by an increased take-up ofpart-time work by older workers and by a risein the number of benefit recipients over theage of 58 who have decided not to registeras unemployed.
Unemployment, which had already been
going up steadily during 2001, showed anespecially sharp rise in January 2002. Thenumber of persons registered as unemployedat the Federal Labour Office went up to4.29 million, ie around 325,000 more than atthe end of December. The increase was thushigher than usual at this time of year. Com-pared with January 2001, an additional195,000 persons were out of work. The un-employment rate as calculated by the FederalLabour Office rose slightly to 9.6%, com-pared with 9.3% in 2000. According to thestandard international method, the figurewas 8.1% at the end of the period under re-view.
In addition to the slowdown in the economy,
an additional factor in the above-average risein unemployment at the turn of 2001-02 wasthe exceptionally sharp onset of winter in the
second half of December. As a result, manyworkers in the weather-dependent outdooroccupations are likely – at least temporarily –to have lost their jobs. The question ofwhether, and to what extent, they are takenon again when the winter weather recedesdepends, not least, on the cyclical outlook inthe construction sector.Seasonally adjusted, quarterly, log scale

36Orders
New orders received by manufacturers visibly
stabilised towards the end of 2001. Aftereliminating seasonal variations, incomingorders showed a marked increase from Octo-ber onwards and, in the fourth quarter as awhole, were only slightly down on the thirdquarter. At the end of 2001, they were 5%down over 12 months, compared with a fig-ure of -7
12% in the fourth quarter overall.
Above all, it was foreign demand whichfirmed up. In some branches of the capitalgoods sector, even a slight improvement wasapparent. By contrast, domestic business de-clined again somewhat in the entire periodfrom October to December 2001.
Demand for construction work likewise ap-
pears to have stabilised in October and No-vember. At all events, incoming constructionorders were showing a tendency to pick up.The year-on-year fall did not become anygreater during this period either, although itremained considerable at around 4%.
The improvement on the order books was
particularly apparent in public construction.The level of new orders in this sector hadbeen very low in summer, however, whichmeans that the present increase signifies hard-ly more than a corrective movement. Indus-trial construction was able to make up groundsomewhat compared with its low at the startof 2001, although there is still no identifiablesweeping change in trend. In residential con-struction, the downward slide continued upto the end of the period under review. Therewas a further decline in new orders in the au-tumn of last year in both eastern and westernGermany. Year-on-year, the decline amountedto around one-fifth. The level of new orders isnow no more than half as high as in 1995.Measured by the number of permits, con-struction of apartment houses and owner-occupied dwellings fell to a new low in west-ern Germany, with the situation in the con-struction of owner-occupied houses addition-ally deteriorating in eastern Germany.Seasonally adjusted, quarterly, log scale

37Prices
In terms of the underlying trend, the price cli-
mate remained obviously relaxed up to theend of the period under review. The declinein international oil prices means that, espe-cially from the external side, major price-dampening stimuli have been generated. Onthe spot markets, Brent North Sea Oil camedown in price to around US$19
12at the turn
of 2001-02, which was roughly US$9, orone-third, less than when the price peakedmost recently in May 2001; it was almostone-quarter lower than the previous year’slevel. This factor was clearly reflected in Ger-man import prices. Seasonally adjusted, theywere declining well into December, being4.7% down on the year at the end of 2001.Industrial producer prices also benefited fromthe falling oil prices. In December, they werenearly 2%, seasonally adjusted, below thepreceding peak of May to June. This meantthat they were scarcely any higher than oneyear before. In the wake of the persistentlyweak demand in autumn, construction workbecame slightly cheaper in year-on-yearterms.
At the start of 2002, however, a jump-rise in
the general price level occurred. According tothe data of the Federal Statistical Office, theyear-on-year rate of increase in the consumerprice index (CPI) went up to 2.1%, comparedwith 1.7% in November and December. Thisis not a case of an inflationary process, how-ever. Rather, particularly seasonal foodstuffs(which include, specifically, fruit and vege-tables), became appreciably more expensive.This was mainly due to the harsh onset of1995 = 100, seasonally adjusted

snow and ice to the south European countrieswhere they are grown. This led to large-scalecrop failure with dramatically increasedprices. The seasonal food products weretherefore more than 10% dearer in Januarythan in 2001. The prices for these goods willreturn to normal, however, when the rangeof products from new crops comes on to themarket.Further tax rises were a second source of
price increases. For one thing, there was afurther stage of the ecological tax on petroland electricity, added to which were increasesin the tax on tobacco and in insurance tax. Inpurely mathematical terms, the tax measurescontributed 0.4 percentage point to themonth-on-month rise in the price index. Thefact that the year-on-year price effectamounted, mathematically, to no more than+0.1 percentage point is due to administeredprice increases at the start of 2001 (motorvehicle tax on cars with high pollutant emis-sions, television and radio licence fees),which, in turn, had had a price effect of0.3 percentage point.
Additionally, the price rise in January should
be seen in connection with the introductionof euro banknotes and coins. One significantfactor is that changing the price of goods andservices to the new currency causes costs. Itwas therefore the obvious thing to combinegeneral price increases, serving the purposeof passing on risen costs or of improvingprofit margins, with the changeover to theeuro. The changeover to prices in euro is thusalso likely to have been used as an occasionto implement price changes that had beenscheduled for some time or planned for theimmediate future anyway. The available stat-istical data indicate that there were sharpprice increases especially in the hotel, restaur-ant and catering sector at the start of theyear. The extent to which similar behaviouroccurred in other sectors must remain anopen question until specific detailed informa-tion provided as part of the official price stat-istics has been analysed.

In the final quarter of last year German for-
eign trade was influenced by the weakness inglobal economic growth. Consequently, turn-over in both exports and imports declined dis-cernibly. The seasonally adjusted 3% fall inthe value of German exports in the fourthquarter compared with the previous periodwas unusually sharp. However, it might bethat exports have now bottomed out. At allevents, the export expectations of German in-dustry over the past few months have beenproviding the first signs of a future recoveryin export business. Assessments of the situ-ation in October had never been so predom-inantly pessimistic since the summer of 1993.Since then, however, there has been a steadyimprovement in sentiment. It is also consist-ent with this development that the orders re-ceived by German industry from abroad haverecently been increasing again. Owing to theusual lag between the receipt of an order andits eventual delivery, however, this wasscarcely reflected in the export volume in thefourth quarter of last year.
German exporters recorded a declining turn-
over with most trading partners during thelast three months for which a statistical break-down is available (September-November2001). Exports to the central and east Euro-pean countries in transition, which, contraryto the general trend, increased relativelysharply (4
12%) during the period under re-
view, were the only exception. Comparedwith the previous period (June-August 2001),there was a fall – in some cases a significantone – in export turnover with almost all otherExports

41major customer countries. For example, ex-
ports to other euro-area countries declined by4%, a development which represented a ser-ious setback for German exporters, given thegreat importance of trade with the euro-areacountries. Although the value of exports tocustomers in the emerging markets of South-East Asia, at 9
12%, and to Japan, at just under
812%, was far below the respective values in
the summer of 2001, these losses are less sig-nificant when viewed in absolute terms. Thechange in exports to the United States, which,despite the pronounced economic downturnthere, had proved very robust until that pointlast year, had a much more serious impact, bycontrast. They failed to maintain their previouslevel during the period under review and de-clined extremely sharply, at 9%, comparedwith the reference period. The normally long-er delivery times in the motor industry, whichaccounts for approximately 30% of Germanexports to the United States, are certainly amajor reason for the considerable delay inGerman exports responding to the changedsituation with respect to new business in thisexport market. Against the background of theterrorist attacks in September and the associ-ated uncertainty on the part of consumersand investors as well as the subsequent break-downs and disruptions to operational and dis-patch procedures, other reasons, too, prob-ably played a major role.
Exports of goods produced by the information
and communication technologies sector (ICT)were particularly badly affected by sentimentthat was generally influenced by major plan-ning uncertainty and decidedly negative ex-pectations. The decline in German exports inthis sector was particularly serious – especially
in the field of accounting and computing ma-chinery at just over 9% and in communica-tions at more than 9
12% – whereas the loss of
turnover in other sectors such as the chemicalindustry (1%) and mechanical engineering(1%) was much more limited.
Turnover on the import side also declined. In

42quarter of last year were likewise 3% below
their level in the previous quarter. However,the decline was due mainly to the sharp fall inimport prices, especially in the case of import-ed sources of energy. Both chemical productsand ICT products were also cheaper. In realterms Germany’s imports of goods in the finalquarter of 2001 fell by just under
12%c o m -
pared with the quarter before, which meansthat they declined more or less in step withthe change in overall economic output.
The distinct downturn, especially in German
manufacturing, is also reflected in the break-down of imports by category of goods. How-ever, these statistics are available only up tothe end of November 2001. For example, im-ports of inputs and capital goods in the three-month period of September to Novemberwere below those in the previous three-month period. The fact that there was also adownturn (of 2
12%) in the imports of foreign
mechanical engineering products is thereforeconsistent with this scenario. The value of im-ports of ICT sector products actually fell by3
12% although this was probably due in part
to the lower prices in this sector. Imports ofmotor vehicles fell particularly sharply (-6%),reflecting the downturn in demand for carsfollowing the high growth rates on both theexport side and the import side in this sectorduring the summer. By contrast, a strikinglysharp rise in the imports of chemical industryproducts was a special development. Duringthe period under review (September toNovember 2001) 7
12% more goods in terms
of value were imported in this sector than inthe previous three months. If the price reduc-tions in this sector during the same period areRegional trend in foreign trade

43taken into account, real growth was even
more pronounced.
Most of Germany’s major trading partners
were affected by the weaker overall demandin Germany. The decline in imports from theother euro-area countries was relatively mod-erate (at -
12%). By contrast, the decline in im-
ports from the United States, Japan andOPEC was unusually sharp at 14
12%, 6% and
19% respectively. While the decline in im-ports from OPEC was due to the substantialfall in oil prices, the aforementioned oper-ational disturbances and delivery disruptionsfollowing the attacks on New York andWashington might also have played a role, es-pecially in the case of the decidedly sharp fallin deliveries from the United States. Increasedimports were recorded only in the case oftrade with the EU countries that are not par-ticipating in monetary union (2
12%) and with
the emerging economies in South-East Asia(2%).
Despite the substantial improvement in Ger-
many’s terms of trade, the German trade bal-ance showed a slight decline in the fourthquarter, falling in seasonally adjusted termsby just under 31 billion to 325

the same time, however, the deficit on invis-ible current transactions with non-residentswas also smaller. The aggregate deficit oncross-border services, factor income and cur-rent transfers declined by 32

Financial transactions
Events on the international financial markets
continued to be influenced in the final quar-ter of 2001 by the gradually receding ner-vousness following the terrorist attacks in theUnited States and the resultant uncertaintyabout global economic developments. Whilemajor central banks reacted to diminishing in-flation risks with further interest rate cuts, theequity and bond markets were subjected torepeated fluctuations in prices and yields.International capital flows likewise displayeda fairly high degree of volatility in the fourthquarter. Yet, initially, the most important mo-tive of many investors was still to retreat intosafe havens. It was not until the end of theyear that investors again appeared to be ad-justing their portfolios more in line with theeconomic outlook and earnings prospects,which differed from one country to another.The German financial account reflects notonly these general trends but also one or twospecial transactions. Even so, a large balan-cing item in the German balance of paymentshas made it more difficult to analyse cross-border capital movements in the fourth quar-ter of 2001.In portfolio investment, where the changing
international influences usually show up withparticular speed and clarity, there were netcapital exports of 316
12billion between Oc-
tober and December 2001 whereas in theprevious three-month period there had beennet capital imports of 324
12billion. This rever-
sal in portfolio flows is essentially due to theDecember figures, in which large outflows offunds predominated. Foreign investors, inparticular, withdrew fairly large amounts ofcapital from the German securities markets inDecember whereas they had previously beeninvesting heavily in Germany as one of thesafe havens. All in all, they acquired Germanpaper worth no more than 314
12billion in
the fourth quarter compared with 32912bil-
lion in the quarter earlier.
In the period under review non-resident in-
vestors continued to show a preference forGerman bonds and notes ( 318 billion), espe-
cially bonds issued by private borrowers ( 321
billion). However, the securitisation of a bookcredit which a German credit institution hadobtained from one of its own foreignbranches played an important role here.Owing to their high degree of liquidity andsecurity, public bonds benefited for a timefrom safe-haven inflows; even so, foreign in-vestors did not always reinvest all of thefunds acquired from redemptions and sales indomestic public bonds throughout the quar-ter (- 33 billion). It is possible that they pre-
ferred the issues of other euro-area countriesto (German) Federal bonds. It is not only theeuro-area balance of payments figures, cover-ing the period up to the end of November,that indicate heavy demand for debt certifi-Trends in

also the fact that the interest rate spreads ofpublic bonds within the euro area had beennarrowing markedly up to the end of theyear.

Non-residents were discernibly restrained ininvesting in the other portfolio segments.They sold German money market paperworth 38 billion net whereas from the start of
monetary union up to about the middle of2000 non-residents had shown considerableinterest in this paper. Foreign investors havepossibly shifted positions from money marketpaper (investments with a maturity of oneyear or less) to debt certificates with some-what longer maturities; this would be in linewith the strong demand for bank bondsdescribed above.

German shares derived little benefit fromthe shifts that non-residents made in theirbond and money market investments. Non-residents invested no more than 3
12billion in
German equities although the German sharemarket had recovered fairly quickly from theslump in prices it had sustained in September.It may well be that this restraint is also a re-flection of the scepticism about the economicoutlook in Germany which prevailed last au-tumn and which did not give way to a some-what more confident mood until recently.
German savers, who had been extremely cau-
tious in their foreign investments in the thirdquarter of last year – and in September, inparticular – again invested somewhat moreheavily in the securities of foreign issuers dur-ing the period under review. At 331 billion,however, their acquisitions were below those
in the first and second quarters (which hadamounted to more than 340 billion in each
case). A distinct recovery set in betweenOctober and December, especially in the de-mand for foreign bonds and notes ( 327 bil-

of comparison, it may be noted that the corresponding

again showing greater interest in foreign cur-rency bonds. At approximately 313
12billion,
they channelled about half of their investablefunds into this type of paper whereas in thequarter before they had sold foreign currencybonds worth 36
12billion. Demand was pri-
marily for US-dollar-denominated paper.US Treasuries possibly benefited most fromthe gradually receding uncertainty amongGerman investors and their reluctance to in-vest in the share market.
Following their withdrawal of funds in the
third quarter, German investors were fairlyslow in returning as purchasers to the inter-national share markets at the end of 2001.Although they invested 32
12billion in foreign
equities between October and December, thissum is comparatively small in relation to theamounts they had been accustomed to in-vesting hitherto (an average of just under 320
billion per quarter in the first 2
12years follow-
ing the start of monetary union). Despite therapid recovery in share prices after the slumpin September, many investors were evidentlywaiting for a time owing to the uncertaineconomic outlook.
In contrast to the outflows in portfolio invest-
ment, there were inflows of funds - 33

47enterprises extended their presence abroad. It
was not the spectacular mega-mergers thatdetermined the end result but, instead, smalland medium-sized investments in variousindustrial sectors. All in all, 35
12billion was
exported in this way.
There were likewise net capital imports in
the statistically recorded credit transactionsof non-banks between October and De-cember 2001. In line with seasonal practice,enterprises and individuals repatriated 37
12
billion, thus reducing their foreign bank de-
posits in particular at the end of the year. Thefinancial operations of public authorities re-sulted in net outflows (of 36 billion) in the
period under review. The Federal Government,which at the end of December 2001 tempor-arily invested liquid funds with banks abroad,played a particularly important role in this.
Various developments emerged in the credit
transactions of the banking system as awhole in the final quarter of last year. Thenon-securitised external transactions of theGerman credit institutions resulted in net out-flows of funds amounting to 358
12billion. In
the process the German banks slightly in-creased their claims on non-resident borrow-ers. At the same time, they made a fairly sub-stantial reduction in their (unsecuritised) ex-ternal borrowing, which had risen significant-ly in the previous few years. The aforemen-tioned replacement of a book credit by a se-curitised credit was the main reason for this.By contrast, the external transactions of theBundesbank that are booked under credittransactions, ie all changes in the Bundes-bank’s claims and liabilities vis-à-vis non-residents with the exception of its foreign
reserves, resulted in net capital imports of334
12billion. The most important item here
was the deficit incurred in the large-valuepayment system TARGET, which was reflectedin the Bundesbank’s substantial liabilities tothe ECB at the end of 2001.
At transaction values, the foreign reserves of
the Bundesbank declined by slightly morethan 32 billion during the last three months
of 2001 whereas they had risen by almost thesame amount between the end of June andthe end of September. This means that atmarket prices, reserves amounted to theequivalent of 393 billion; hence they were
about 31
12billion below the level at the end
of September 2001 and also somewhat lessthan at the end of 2000.
A fairly significant discrepancy ( 328
12billion)
arose between the incoming and outgoingtransactions recorded in the balance of pay-ments in the fourth quarter of 2001. The nat-ural assumption that this might have beendue primarily to difficulties in allocating trans-actions to the period in which they actuallyoccurred (for example, as a result of the cus-tomary valuation periods in portfolio transac-tions) appears to be scarcely plausible as posi-tive balancing items had also been recordedin previous quarters and yet no equalisationhad evidently been reached over time – or, atleast, not so far. It remains to be seenwhether the late reports and correctionswhich will be incorporated into the balanceof payments up to the publication of the2001 annual figures in March will result in asignificant reduction in the balancing item.Credit

48Public financeCentral, state and local government
In the fourth quarter of 2001 the budgetary
positions of central, state and local govern-ment worsened considerably compared withthe fourth quarter of the previous year. Thedeficits for 2001 as a whole also increasedsharply. They probably rose from 333 billion
in 2000 (excluding the UMTS proceeds) to al-most 350 billion – the highest figure recorded
since 1996. This was mainly due to a steepdrop in tax receipts brought about primarilyby the tax cuts. Although other receipts, par-ticularly privatisation proceeds, increasedsharply, overall receipts fell perceptibly. Ex-penditure grew only moderately (by approxi-mately 1%), chiefly because compensation ofemployees barely increased and spending oninterest payments and tangible assets actuallydecreased. The individual levels of govern-ment recorded very different trends, althoughthis owed something to exceptional factors.While the Federal Government’s deficit fellsomewhat and the special funds recordedmore favourable figures, the financial situ-ation of the local authorities and especiallytheLand governments worsened severely. As
things now stand, no substantial reduction inthe budget deficits may be expected in 2002.Although tax revenue should increase notice-ably, despite the persistently unfavourablemacroeconomic setting, non-tax revenue isexpected to decrease and overall expenditureis likely to rise more sharply than last year.Overview

49Tax revenue1fell in the fourth quarter of
2001 by 6.5% in comparison with the sameperiod in 2000. This was mainly due to lowerreceipts resulting from the tax reform and tothe economic slowdown. In particular, thedownward slide in corporation tax receiptsaccelerated further, in part owing to sizeablerefunds to some enterprises. According to theprovisional figures (which only contain an es-timate for local authority taxes), tax revenuefell by 4.5% in 2001. The overall tax ratio (asdefined in the financial statistics) consequent-ly declined by 1
12percentage points to
21.6%. The principal reason for this was theextensive relief granted by the tax reformwhich was offset only to a small extent byadditional receipts from the third stage of the“ecological tax reform”. Furthermore, actualtax receipts fell far short of the expectationsowing to the weaker overall economic cli-mate and other reasons. Actual receipts were32.8 billion lower than predicted in the last
official forecast in November and as much as312.8 billion below the corresponding tax es-
timate from autumn 2000 – on which thebudget plans had been largely based.
The revenue shortfalls vis-à-vis the budget
plans especially affected turnover tax and cor-poration tax. Receipts from turnover tax de-creased by 1.4% and undershot the amountforecast in autumn 2000 by 37.3 billion.
These large shortfalls were only partly attrib-utable to the weaker than expected growthin the VAT tax base. Structural shifts in privateconsumption in favour of tax-free and tax-reduced components likewise appear to haveplayed a role. In addition, there seem to havebeen considerable insolvency-related short-falls.
2In addition, a good many companies
may well have deferred their turnover taxpayments on account of their strained liquid-ity position even though they will be chargedinterest for such late payments. Corporationtax receipts were a massive 312.7 billion less
than forecast in the estimate made in autumn2000, which had already taken the tax reforminto account. Refunds of corporation tax ac-tually exceeded tax payments by 30.4 billion.
However, a large part of the revenue short-falls was caused by high special dividend dis-tributions and was offset by additional re-Change from previous year

50ceipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings
amounting to 37.5 billion.3Furthermore, the
worsened profit situation – due partly tolarge write-downs on participating interests –and lower payments in respect of earlier yearscontributed to the disappointing corporationtax result. By contrast, wage tax and assessedincome tax marginally surpassed the expect-ations, although receipts from these taxes stilldecreased (by 2.3% and 28.2% respectively)in the wake of the tax reform. In the case ofwage tax this was due, inter alia , to shifting
bonus payments to 2001 for tax reasons,while in the case of assessed income tax thepartial netting facility for trade tax introducedas part of the tax reform had not yet had asubstantial effect on advance tax payments.In 2002 tax revenue should rise considerably
and increase more sharply than nominal GDP .Reasons for this are that the effect of progres-sive taxation will ensure higher income tax re-ceipts and that the scale of the tax increaseswill exceed the additional tax relief meas-ures.
4The official estimate from November
anticipated a 3% increase in tax revenue; tak-ing into account the changes in tax legislationdisregarded in the estimate, tax receiptswould rise by approximately 4% given nom-inal economic growth of 3%. However, asthings now stand it seems likely that overalleconomic growth will fail to match the ex-pectations made in autumn. The level of taxrevenue will also be influenced by the poorerstarting position inherited from last year.

3Many companies distributed profits retained in earlier
years (and taxed at a rate of 45%) so as to claim a cor-
poration tax rebate of 15 percentage points. Such distri-
butions were evidently also used to offset intra-group
losses, which is no longer possible under the new corpor-
ation tax system.
4On the one hand, the increased family assistance meas-
ures will push receipts down. On the other hand, add-
itional tax revenue will result from the counterfinancing
of the tax reductions, the fourth stage of the “ecological
tax reform”, the increase in tobacco tax and insurance
tax as well as measures to combat turnover tax fraud.

51of32.9 billion were moderate in comparison
with those at other levels of government be-cause transfers to the EU were lower than ex-pected thanks to a large surplus in the 2000EU budget. Moreover, they were largely off-set by higher non-tax receipts. The FederalGovernment’s expenditure fell by 1.4%
6and
undershot the estimate by 32 billion. Al-
though the worse-than-expected labour mar-ket trend necessitated higher spending onunemployment assistance and grants to theFederal Labour Office (together totalling 32.5
billion), interest payments and guarantees, inparticular, were lower than the figuresbudgeted.
The Federal budget for this year envisages a
rise in the deficit of 32.6 billion to 323.7 bil-
lion.
7This is 31.5 billion higher than in the
draft budget. Additional burdens resultingfrom the cyclically-induced lower level of pro-jected tax receipts and extra labour market-induced expenditure (together totalling ap-proximately 35 billion) exceed higher privat-
isation proceeds and lower projected interestpayments and grants to the “German Unity”Fund vis-à-vis the draft budget. Additional ex-penditure on internal and external security(31
12billion) will be financed by additional
revenue from the increase in tobacco tax andinsurance tax. Overall expenditure will riseconsiderably after having decreased in theprevious two years. The main reasons for thisare sharp increases in the required transfer tothe Federal Railways Fund, labour market-related expenditure, transfers to the statutorypension insurance fund financed by the“ecology tax”, and spending on internal andexternal security. The 2002 budget containssubstantial privatisation proceeds which are
only a transitory form of financing. Attainingthe targeted figures will require very frugalbudget management, particularly since thecyclical trend is now assessed as being less fa-vourable than when the budget was adopt-ed. 5 bn

6The reasons for this include the non-recurrence of the
indemnification payments to wartime forced and slave la-
bourers made in 2000 (approximately 1% of the expend-
iture volume) and the temporarily lower grants to the
Federal Railways Fund (also around 1%) owing to the
substantial privatisation proceeds allocated to that fund.
7The deficit trend in the outturn for 2001 and the esti-
mate for 2002 deviates strongly from the development of
net borrowing. The reasons for this are high coin sei-
gniorage last year in connection with the currency
changeover and the high coin revenue this year con-
tained in the budget. These financial transactions influ-
ence net government borrowing but not the deficit. Net
borrowing should fall from 322.8 billion in the 2001 out-
turn to 321.1 billion in 2002. The estimated seigniorage

52Last year the special funds recorded a surplus
of35.1 billion following a deficit of 31.7 bil-
lion in 2000. Firstly, the share of the Bundes-bank profit allocated to the Redemption Fundfor Inherited Liabilities was almost 34
12billion
higher than in 2000. Secondly, the deficit ofthe ERP Special Fund decreased by 32 billion
owing to reduced lending and greater repay-ments.
In the fourth quarter of 2001 the deficit of
theLand Governments ( 316.2 billion) was
38.3 billion higher than in the same period in
2000. This was largely caused by the declinein tax revenue by 10.1%. The most severelyaffected Land was North-Rhine Westphalia,
which recorded a downturn of one-quarter,not least because of large tax refunds. TheLand Governments’ other revenue fell just as
sharply as tax revenue over 12 months. Themain reason for this was that at the begin-ning of December Lower Saxony was obligedby a ruling of the Federal AdministrativeCourt to repay natural gas extraction royaltiesplus interest amounting to 31
14billion. The
Land Governments’ expenditure grew by
1.1% in the fourth quarter. If Baden-Würt-temberg had not made an equity injectioninto the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, aslight decrease in expenditure would havebeen recorded. In 2001 as a whole the deficitincreased dramatically from 39.8 billion in
2000 to 327.6 billion, principally because of
the revenue shortfalls related to the tax re-form, although substantial extraordinary bur-dens also played a role. Besides the transac-tions in the fourth quarter already mentioned,these chiefly included the recapitalisation ofBankgesellschaft Berlin. Not least given thefurther tax cuts already agreed, the Land
Governments’ objective of reducing their def-icits can only be achieved through stringentlycurbing their spending. This is also necessarybecause a number of Land Governments are
struggling to keep below their statutory ceil-ings for new borrowing.
For the local authorities only the results for
the first three quarters are available atpresent. During that period they accumulateda deficit of 33.2 billion, whereas close-to-
balance budget outturns were recorded inthe first nine months of 2000. While revenuedecreased by 1.6% following a steep slumpin municipal tax receipts, expenditure rosefurther by 1.4%. This was primarily due to anincrease in social payments (+3.5%). In con-trast to previous years, it seems that thefourth quarter will not exhibit a noticeablesurplus, so that for the first time in threeyears the local authorities will most probablyrecord a deficit for 2001 as a whole.
The indebtedness of central, state and local
government increased sharply by 315 billion
in the fourth quarter. While money marketdebt fell by 33 billion, the liabilities on the
capital market rose by 318 billion. In 2001 as
a whole net borrowing by central, state andlocal government reached 314 billion. This
relatively small amount was mainly due to thedebt repayment out of the UMTS proceedscarried out at the beginning of 2001.Special funds

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the wage and
salary earners’ pension insurance scheme re-corded a customary seasonal surplus which,at32.5 billion, was nonetheless 31.0 billion
less than in the final quarter of 2000. In 2001as a whole it recorded a deficit of 31.1 bil-
lion,
8whereas in 2000 it had generated a sur-
plus of 30.6 billion. As a result, the statutory
fluctuation reserve requirement of onemonth’s expenditure was not quite reached(93%). This was caused primarily by smallercontributions brought about by the overalleconomic slowdown.
The deficit is set to expand further in 2002.
The main reason for this is that the fluctu-ation reserve requirement has been loweredfrom 1.0 to 0.8 month’s expenditure to avoidhaving to raise the contribution rate from19.1% to 19.4%. Furthermore, a fall in con-tribution receipts anticipated from the mean-while less optimistically assessed cyclicaltrend, and higher contributions to pensioners’health insurance funds are likely from themiddle of the year as a result of increasedcontribution rates.
In the final quarter of 2001 the Federal La-
bour Office recorded a surplus of 30.5 billion,
although this result was boosted by excep-tional substantial receipts from the EuropeanSocial Fund. The deficit for 2001 as a wholewas 31.9 billion, which was more than
double the corresponding figure in 2000. Itwas also way above the budget estimate of30.6 billion. While total revenue increased by
2.2%, expenditure rose by 4.2%. Spendingon unemployment benefits went up by
4.3%. This was due to higher per capitabenefits resulting from the requirement sinceAugust 2000 to take account of one-off sal-ary payments when calculating benefitclaims. By contrast, the number of un-employed actually fell by 0.5% on an annualaverage. Some 1.9% more was spent on ac-tive labour market policy measures. Increasedspending on vocational training and retrain-ing by one-tenth offset a decrease by one-quarter in spending on job creation measures.Expenditure on payments pending insolvencyproceedings, pre-retirement part-time work-Net borrowing in the market by

54ing and refunds to the pension insurance in-
stitutions for labour market-related disabilitypensions also rose sharply.
The budget for 2002 envisages a deficit of
32.0 billion for the Federal Labour Office,
which is to be covered by a transfer from theFederal budget. This is based on the assump-tion of 3.9 million unemployed on an annualaverage, which implies only a small rise fromlast year’s total. In the Annual Economic Re-port 2002 the Federal Government assumesan average of just under 4 million un-employed persons. Without savings, there-fore, the budgeted grant will probably notsuffice to cover the deficit.
Following four years of virtually balanced
budgets, the statutory health insurance fundsare expected to register a considerable deficit
for 2001, mainly owing to a steep increase inexpenditure on pharmaceuticals. Many healthinsurance institutions raised their contributionrate on 1 January 2002. The average contri-bution rate to the health insurance funds for2002 as a whole will increase by almost
12percentage point to around 14%.
Development of the general government
sector as a whole
The government deficit ratio as defined in the
Maastricht Treaty rose to 2.6% last year ac-cording to the first preliminary national ac-counts figures. In 2000 it had amounted toonly 1.3% (excluding UMTS proceeds). Thissharp increase vis-à-vis the previous year wascyclically induced only to a small extent.
9Al-
though real macroeconomic growth was sig-nificantly lower than its medium-term trend,the nominal rate of growth, which is moreimportant for the revenue trend, was morefavourable. In addition, the increase in grosswages and salaries (especially the per capitaincrease), which is relevant for wage tax andsocial security contributions, proved fairly ro-bust. Finally, unemployment – which is thekey factor determining the magnitude ofcyclically-related expenditure – was actually alittle lower in 2001 on average than in 2000.
The sharp increase in the deficit was mainly
due to structural causes, above all tax short-falls resulting from the tax reform. Other im-Quarterly

55portant factors were the lower contribution
rate to the statutory pension insurancescheme and a decrease in turnover tax whichcannot be explained by macroeconomic de-velopments. Although a further stage in the“ecological tax” entered into force and otherrevenue also increased sharply – not least dueto the significant rise in the Bundesbank’sprofit – the revenue ratio declined by justunder 1
12percentage points to 46.2%.
Expenditure rose by 1.6%. Given the margin-
ally higher nominal growth of GDP , the ex-penditure ratio fell slightly to 48.8%. Com-pensation of employees increased only slight-ly thanks to a moderate pay settlement onbalance and a decline in government staffnumbers. Interest payments actually de-creased, above all owing to the debt repay-ment made possible by the UMTS proceedsand the persistently low interest rate level,which eased the refinancing of maturingbonds. Government investment expenditureand Federal Government transfers to the EUalso fell. Finally, the one-off burden caused bythe indemnification of wartime forced andslave labourers, which had affected thebudget in 2000, did not recur. On the otherhand, social payments rose sharply by 3%.They were pushed up by the massive surge inspending on pharmaceuticals, the notable in-crease in expenditure by the pension insur-ance funds and the raising of unemploymentand sickness benefits following a ruling of theFederal Constitutional Court. The cost of civilservants’ pensions also increased strongly. AttheLand government level, the expenditure
total was burdened by a large one-off refundof natural gas extraction royalties.If no additional deficit-raising measures are
adopted, a further increase in the deficit ratioin 2002 seems unlikely at the moment, des-pite the greater strain placed on public fi-nance by current cyclical developments. Thestructural deficit would then decline notice-ably. This expectation is grounded in the factthat the taxes and social security ratio will in-crease.

56impact. Furthermore, the measures to coun-
terfinance the tax cuts which were intro-duced in 2001 will make themselves morefully felt this year. In addition, several excisetaxes (on mineral oil, electricity, tobacco andinsurance) have been raised. Additional rev-enue is also expected from turnover tax as aresult of improved anti-fraud measures. Final-ly, many health insurance institutions wereobliged to significantly increase their contri-bution rates at the turn of the year. The gov-ernment expenditure ratio is likely to increasesomewhat. The growth of expenditure will bedriven particularly by the increase in childbenefit, a significant increase in labour mar-ket-related expenditure, interest paymentsand the cost of internal and external security.If, judged from the present perspective, the
government deficit ratio remains below the3% ceiling stipulated by the MaastrichtTreaty, this should not be taken to mean thatbudgetary policy makers have any room forfurther benefits or tax cuts. That would con-tradict the more far-reaching objective of theStability and Growth Pact, which was estab-lished in 1997 above all at the initiative of theFederal Government at that time. As ex-plained in detail in the box on page 58, oneof the key objectives of this Pact is to definethe 3% ceiling not as “the norm” but as theabsolute upper limit of the deficit. The re-quirement of a budget position which is closeto balance or in surplus in the medium term– ie on average during the business cycle –sets a far more ambitious fiscal policy orienta-tion.

57Government budget deficits and the legal framework of the European Union
The Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992. As a
sound fiscal policy in all member states is a fun-damental requirement for a stable Europeanmonetary union, the Treaty laid down thatmember states must avoid excessive governmentdeficits (Article 104 (1) of the Treaty establishingthe European Community). The existence of anexcessive deficit is gauged on the basis of the fis-cal “Maastricht criteria”. According to these cri-teria, the general government deficit may not,as a rule, exceed the reference value of 3% ofGDP and government debt may not exceed 60%of GDP. The Maastricht Treaty and the associatedprotocols spelling out the details themselves en-visage sanctions for individual member stateswith an excessive deficit.
In the run-up to stage three of European eco-
nomic and monetary union, doubts arose as towhether the EC Treaty provisions would sufficeto ensure a sustainable public finance position.It was principally for this reason that – mainly atGermany’s instigation – a European Stability andGrowth Pact was drawn up and adopted at theEuropean Summit of Amsterdam in June 1997.
1
Besides laying down detailed rules for imple-menting the excessive deficit procedure andstrengthening the surveillance of budgetarypositions in the EC – in particular through an“early warning system” – the Pact obliges allmember states to achieve a medium-termbudgetary position that is close to balance or insurplus. This requirement creates a sufficientsafety margin which allows the automatic stabil-isers to operate without the risk of runningup an excessive deficit within the meaning ofArticle 104 of the EC Treaty. This implies that def-icits are permissible during downturns but thatsurpluses need to be generated during upturns.In this way a nominally balanced budgetary pos-ition will be maintained in the medium term,ie on average during the course of the business
cycle.
For most countries, the European Commission
interprets compatibility with the Pact’s objectiveto mean a cyclically adjusted deficit ratio of 0.5%at most.
2The European Commission’s demands,
which set even more ambitious targets for somecountries, are shaped by the following factors.
3
– The deficit ratio needs to encompass suffi-
cient room for manoeuvre to safeguard the3% threshold so as to accommodate the im-pact of cyclical influences on the budget.
– Allowance has to be made for uncertainty re-
garding other unforeseen fluctuations in thebudgets, such as the interest rate trend.
– Countries with a very high debt level should
make sure that their debt ratio is speedilybrought down to the reference value of 60%of GDP.
These requirements were met by most of the
member states last year. In accordance with thePact’s provisions and within the framework oftheir own stability and convergence pro-grammes, those countries which have not at-tained such a position four years after the Pactwas signed have set themselves the target ofachieving a balanced budget at least from 2004-2005.
In addition to the aforementioned require-
ments, steps should be taken, in the form of ap-propriate medium-term budgetary targets, tomake provisions for the future burdens on pub-lic finance which will ensue from the progressiveageing of the population.
1The Pact consists of the Resolution of the European
Council on the Stability and Growth Pact (Amsterdam,17 June 1997), Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on thestrengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positionsand the surveillance and coordination of economic pol-icies, and Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 on speedingup and clarifying the implementation of the excessive def-icit procedure.

58the deficit ceiling to the maximum extentfrom the outset, this would not only be in-compatible with the Stability and GrowthPact but would also give rise to the danger –in view of the unavoidable and unpredictablefluctuations in the budgetary trend – that the3% limit set in the Maastricht Treaty might beexceeded. This could jeopardise the under-standing of the need for sound public fi-nances which was successfully propagatednot least by the Stability and Growth Pact. Inturn, that would hamper the task of pursuinga stability-orientated monetary policy.In December 2001 the Federal Governmentpresented an updated stability programme. Itreaffirmed the goal of the preceding pro-gramme of achieving a balanced budget by2004 (see table on page 59). At the sametime the starting position worsened notice-ably in 2001. Whereas the previous pro-gramme had predicted a deficit ratio of 112%
for 2001, the December update (more or lessin line with the preliminary outturn) puts thefigure at 2
12%. This failure to attain the def-
icit goal is mainly due to the fact that theoverall economic development was muchworse than expected
10and that the deficits
for the previous years were revised upwards,which also had some effect on 2001. Finally,other factors – not least an extraordinarilysharp increase in expenditure in some areasof the statutory health insurance funds – like-wise played a part in the failure to meet thetarget set by the previous stability pro-gramme.To the extent that the planned deficit target isexceeded owing to an unfavourable macro-economic development, this overshootingshould not be confused with the – consider-ably smaller – cyclically related deficit increasevis-à-vis the previous year (see page 55). Thelatter arises because the macroeconomic as-sessment bases underlying cyclical revenueand expenditure deviate from their medium-term trend. However, for 2001 the previousstability programme assumed a macroeco-nomic growth rate significantly higher thanthis trend, namely 2
34%. Therefore, the devi-
ation of the actual deficit from the goal set inthe stability programme due to the less fa-vourable overall economic development waslikewise inevitably far greater than thecyclically-related additional burden comparedwith 2000.For the current year, the updated stability pro-gramme envisages a deficit ratio of 2%.However, this value is no longer realistic giventhe current less favourable assessment of thegeneral economic outlook, which is also re-flected in the Federal Government’s latestforecast in its Annual Economic Report. Adeficit ratio of 2
12% is now anticipated. Such
a development was included in an alternativescenario in the stability programme, which inthe event of lower macroeconomic growthrates projected higher deficit ratios also in thefollowing years – namely 1% for both 2004and 2005.The clear failure to meet the deficit target in2001 and the likelihood that the deficit will

prompted the European Commission to rec-ommend the Ecofin Council at its meeting on12 February to issue an “early warning” toGermany. The Commission’s action was incomplete accord with the relevant provisionsof the Stability and Growth Pact, which inter
aliaoblige the Commission to use its right of
initiative in a manner that facilitates the strict,timely and effective functioning of the Pact.
However, the Ecofin Council did not take a
decision on this recommendation to issue anearly warning to Germany. Instead, the Fed-eral Government pledged to take to heart theconcerns expressed by the Commission’s rec-ommendation. Thus it will seek to ensure thatthe 3% ceiling is not exceeded this year by in-tensively monitoring the implementation ofthe budget at all levels of government. The
Federal Government promised further toavoid fiscal measures which would burdenthe budget and to use any budgetary leewayin order to reduce the deficits. Finally, theFederal Government reaffirmed that, in keep-ing with its previous pledges, a close-to-balance budgetary position will be reached by2004. It pointed out that this may necessitateadditional steps over and above the measuresindicated in the updated stability programmeas soon as the economic situation improves.Through compacts with the Land Govern-

60mitment which has already been met by most
of the member states. In Germany, however,given the size of the deficits, this will requirean extremely ambitious policy of spendingcurbs by all levels of government, particularlyas further tax cuts will be implemented in2003 (and again in 2005). In the mediumterm, the stability programme envisageskeeping the annual growth of general gov-ernment expenditure below 2% as defined inthe national accounts. The expenditure of thesocial security funds is to grow by around2
12% and that of central, state and local gov-
ernment by 112%. It should be noted in the
context of budgetary policy that in the me-dium term the expenditure growth recordedin the budget accounts will be lower thanthat recorded in the national accounts.
11This
means that if the expenditure growth ofcentral, state and local government is not toexceed 1
12% as defined in the national ac-
counts, an even smaller growth rate is re-quired in the budget accounts. The assump-tions in the stability programme are thusmore ambitious than the target of the Finan-cial Planning Council, which recommendscapping the expenditure growth of central,state and local government (as defined in thebudget accounts) to a maximum of 2%.Germany has a pronounced federal structure.
For example, the Land Governments make
their own decisions on borrowing. The sharpexpansion of the deficit among the Land Gov-
ernments last year makes it clear that a gen-eral government consolidation goal can onlybe attained if all tiers of government are in-volved. This necessitates the adoption of rulesthat are binding at all budgetary levels. Forthe medium term, the Stability and GrowthPact prescribes general government budgetsthat are at least close to balance. A systemat-ic national implementation of the Pact wouldinclude firm budgetary regulations requiringthe goal of a balanced budget at all levels ofgovernment. In a first step in this direction, itis true, the requirement to strive for a bal-anced budget – due to come into force in2005 – was adopted in the Budget PrinciplesAct, which applies to the Federal Govern-ment and the Land Governments. No con-
crete timetable was laid down, however.
Expenditure
growth needs
to be tightly
capped
11For example, various items which are currently grow-
ing extremely sharply, such as child benefit or the grant
to home-buyers, are recorded as expenditure in the na-
tional accounts but booked as negative tax revenue in
the budget accounts.Balanced
budgets should
be aimed for at
all levels of
government
