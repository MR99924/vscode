Economic conditions
Underlying trends
In the final quarter of 2022, real gross domes -
tic product (GDP) is likely to have more or less 
stagnated, and thus exceeded previous expect -
ations.1 Overall, the latest data releases were 
better than had been assumed in the Decem -
ber projection.2 High inflation and uncertainty 
surrounding the war in Ukraine weighed on the 
economy in the fourth quarter, but the situ -
ation in the energy markets eased markedly 
compared with the third quarter. In addition, 
further fiscal measures were taken which will 
alleviate some of the pressure households and 
enterprises are facing due to high energy costs. 
Moreover, supply bottlenecks in industry and 
construction became less of an issue. As a re -
sult, the business climate brightened over the 
course of the quarter, according to surveys by 
the ifo Institute. Output in both industry and 
construction increased based on data available 
up to November. However, high inflation damp -
ened households’ propensity to spend. On an 
average of October and November, price-  
adjusted sales in both the retail and the accom -
modation and food service sectors fell signifi -
cantly compared with the third quarter. Car 
purchases provided positive impetus, by con -
trast, with motor vehicle registrations increas -
ing extremely robustly in the fourth quarter ac -
cording to data from the German Association 
of the Automotive Industry (VDA). This was 
partly due to advance purchases, as govern -
ment subsidies for plug- in hybrids were 
scrapped at the end of 2022 and were reduced 
for electric vehicles.
According to provisional calculations by the 
Federal Statistical Office, real GDP rose by 1.9% 
on the year in 2022 as a whole (and by 2.0% 
after calendar adjustment). It thus slightly ex -
ceeded its pre- pandemic level again. The eco -
nomic recovery was weakened by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. This led to new 
supply chain problems. The further spike in in -
flation and uncertainty about energy supply 
caused by the war weighed on firms and 
households. Private consumption nevertheless 
rose steeply, as the lifting of most coronavirus 
restrictions led to strong catch- up effects. Eco -
nomic growth was also driven by exports and 
investment in machinery and equipment. By 
contrast, construction investment fell amid 
high construction prices and a substantial in -
crease in lending rates.
Industry
In November 2022, seasonally adjusted3 indus -
trial output was somewhat higher on the 
month (+½%). On an average of October and 
November, it was up slightly overall on the 
third quarter (+½%). The energy crisis is mainly 
affecting energy-  intensive industrial sectors.4 
Their output continued to decline steeply com -
pared with the third quarter, whereas output 
increased markedly in the other industrial sec -
tors as an aggregate. Production of intermedi -
ate goods, which encompasses the energy-  
intensive industrial sectors, dropped signifi -
cantly. Production of consumer goods also fell 
considerably, although the manufacture of 
pharmaceutical products was substantially 
higher. By contrast, production of capital goods 
picked up considerably, rising particularly 
sharply in the automotive industry. According 
to data from the German Association of the German eco -
nomic activity

Automotive Industry, the number of passenger 
cars produced suffered a setback in December, 
but rose significantly when averaged over the 
fourth quarter.
Industrial new orders declined steeply in No -
vember 2022 after adjustment for seasonal 
variations (-5¼%). Demand for industrial goods 
thus fell back below its pre- pandemic level for 
the first time since August 2020. Although 
large orders also contributed to this decline, 
order intake decreased strongly even after fac -
toring them out. On an average of October 
and November, orders were down considerably 
on the third quarter (-4¾%). Orders received 
from the euro area countries fell particularly 
steeply, but sharply lower demand was also re -
corded in non- euro area countries and in Ger -
many. The drop in demand affected almost all 
sectors, with the exception of the manufacture 
of pharmaceutical products and of motor ve -
hicles and motor vehicle parts. Broken down by 
main groupings, demand for consumer goods 
fell only slightly, whereas manufacturers of cap -
ital and intermediate goods saw substantially 
lower incoming orders.
Nominal industrial sales experienced a signifi -
cant month- on- month increase in November 
2022 after seasonal adjustment (+1¾%). On an 
average of October and November, too, they 
were up markedly on the third quarter (+2%). 
Sales were distinctly higher in Germany and 
even saw a major rise outside Germany. While 
sales of capital and consumer goods rose 
strongly, sales of intermediate goods were 
down markedly. In November, nominal goods 
exports climbed slightly on the month after ad -
justment for seasonal variations. Averaged over 
October and November, they were distinctly 
higher than the third quarter. Since export 
prices declined, price- adjusted goods exports 
even saw a major increase (+3¼%). Exports to 
both euro area and non- euro area countries 
picked up. Nominal imports of goods declined 
sharply again in November (-2¾%). On an

(-3½%). In price- adjusted terms, the decline 
was much milder (-1%), as import prices for en -
ergy, in particular, fell steeply. Imports of goods 
from both euro area and non- euro area coun -
tries decreased slightly in price- adjusted terms.
Construction
Construction output declined significantly in 
November 2022 in seasonally adjusted terms 
(-2¼%). This was due to a steep drop in the fin -
ishing trades. Output rose distinctly in the main 
construction sector, however. Averaged over 
October and November, construction output 
increased somewhat on the previous quarter 
(+1%). While output in the main construction 
sector saw steep growth, it contracted mark -
edly in the finishing trades. The mild weather in 
October and November for that time of year 
was beneficial for construction output. How -
ever, according to ifo Institute surveys, the per -
centage of firms in the main construction sec -
tor reporting that weather conditions were 
hampering construction activity rose again sig -
nificantly in December. Construction activity in 
the fourth quarter was probably supported by 
receding shortages of labour and materials. 
This is also indicated by the ifo Institute’s survey 
results. By contrast, high construction prices 
and increased interest rates continued to weigh 
on demand for construction work. Although 
new orders in the main construction sector saw 
a major improvement in October – the latest 
month for which data are available – they were 
still considerably lower than the highs of the 
fourth quarter of 2021. The number of building 
permits continued to decline sharply. According 
to ifo Institute surveys, the reach of the order 
books averaged over the fourth quarter of 
2022 lagged somewhat behind the third-  
quarter average. Even so, the order books are 
still well stocked.Labour market
In seasonally adjusted terms, employment 
growth in November 2022 was again stronger 
than in the six months from April to the end of 
September. The substantial increase in the min -
imum wage as from 1 October has had no dis -
cernible negative impact. Instead, firms seem 
to be more optimistic again given the better 
than recently expected economic situation and 
outlook. The number of persons in work went 
up by 50,000 on the month. However, the Fed -
eral Employment Agency’s initial estimate of 
employment subject to social security contribu -
tions –  which only extends to October  – is 
weak by comparison, with only a small increase 
compared with September 2022. By contrast, 
there was a relatively strong uptick in the num -
ber of persons in exclusively low- paid part- time 
jobs for the third month in a row. Short- time 
work for economic reasons was probably used 
again somewhat more frequently in October 
than in the previous two months. However, the 
level of take- up remains moderate. The leading 
indicators point to slightly positive employment 
growth in the coming months.
Registered unemployment fell slightly by 
13,000 persons to 2.52 million in December 
after adjustment for seasonal variations. The 
unemployment rate remained unchanged due 
to rounding, holding steady at 5.5%. Part of 
the decline is attributable to Ukrainian refu -
gees, as they drop out of the unemployment 
statistics when their participation in a language 
or integration course makes them unavailable 
to the labour market. Total underemployment, 
by contrast, shows a small increase. This figure 
includes persons taking part in active labour 
market policy measures and integration meas -
ures. Despite positive employment growth, un -
employment could tend to rise in the next few 
months given the large number of persons 
needing to be integrated. The unemployment 
barometer of the Institute for Employment Re -
search (IAB) has improved slightly, but remains 
in negative territory.Construction

Prices
Brent crude oil prices fluctuated around US$80 
per barrel in December and January. Overall, 
price-  dampening and price-  driving factors bal -
anced each other out. The broad lifting of ad -
ministrative pandemic- related restrictions in 
China is likely to boost global oil demand in the 
future. However, the recovery in the Chinese 
economy initially ground to a halt due to a 
massive wave of COVID-  19 infections. As this 
report went to press, a barrel of Brent crude oil 
cost US$84. Futures were being traded at slight 
discounts (US$1 for deliveries six months ahead 
and US$3¾ twelve months ahead). Due to 
mild weather conditions and the fact that gas 
inventories have even been rising again in some 
cases, European wholesale gas prices have 
dropped to €62 per megawatt hour in the past 
few weeks. This meant gas was around 20% 
cheaper than one year ago. In the medium and 
longer term, too, forward quotations are cur -
rently signalling significantly lower prices than 
just a few weeks ago.
In November, there were significant price re -
ductions at the upstream stages of the econ -
omy. This was primarily due to energy. The 
costs of importing energy had already fallen in 
the preceding months and have now gone 
down again markedly. In addition, for the first 
time in more than two years, prices for im -
ported non- energy inputs also dropped month 
on month in November. This was attributable 
to further price decreases for intermediate and 
consumer goods. Moreover, the rise in capital 
goods prices came to a standstill. Prices also re -
treated at the domestic producer level, albeit 
somewhat less strongly than in the previous 
month. Besides price decreases for energy, the 
prices of other components did not rise any 
further or even declined somewhat. Neverthe -
less, import prices in November were up by 
14.5% on the year and producer prices by as 
much as 28.2%.
Consumer price dynamics also continued to 
weaken in December. This likewise mainly re -lated to energy prices. They declined signifi -
cantly owing to the government’s assumption 
of monthly gas and district heating bills (De -
cember immediate assistance) and a further re -
duction in crude oil prices. As a result, the Har -
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 
1.5% lower on the month after seasonal ad -
justment, which constituted the largest decline 
by far since the introduction of the euro. How -
ever, prices of non- energy components con -
tinued to rise sharply. This applies both to food 
and to industrial goods and services. The an -
nual inflation rate in Germany stood at 9.6% in 
December, thus dropping back into single digits 
for the first time since August.5 This decrease is 
mainly due to the one- off immediate assistance 
in December, and is therefore likely to be tem -
porary. Starting in January 2023, the gas and 
electricity price brakes are set to already be in -
cluded in the official price statistics, but this is 
likely to dampen the inflation rate less sharply 
than the immediate assistance in December 
had done earlier. The core inflation rate, which 
strips out energy and food prices, climbed 
slightly by 0.3  percentage point to 5.4%, by 
contrast. It thus reached a new all- time high.
Historically high inflation rates were recorded in 
2022. As measured by the HICP , the annual rate 
of inflation was 8.7%, which was by far the 
highest figure since the introduction of the 
euro.6 This was caused by several factors. Over 
the course of 2021 already, aggregate demand 
had risen sharply amid the subsiding corona -
virus pandemic. However, this demand could 
not be met directly, as global supply chains 
were still severely constrained at the beginning 
of 2022. These price-  driving effects were cru -
cially amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 
resulting not only in renewed price surges for Sideways move -

5 The national consumer price index (CPI) increased by 
8.6% on the year, down from 10.0% in November. The CPI 
rate is currently significantly lower than the HICP rate be -
cause services have a higher weight in the CPI owing to the 
inclusion of owner-  occupied housing, and prices for ser -
vices are not rising as sharply as goods prices at the mo -
ment.

supply bottlenecks.
Public finances7
Local government finances
Local governments (core budgets and off-  
budget entities) posted a surplus of almost €1 
billion in the third quarter of 2022. The result 
thus remained more favourable (+€1 billion) 
than in the same quarter of the previous year. 
Revenue again rose substantially, by 8½% 
(+€6½ billion), with taxes climbing by 13% 
(+€3½ billion). Growth in receipts from local 
business tax – a large revenue item – was even 
somewhat stronger. In this respect, there was 
no sign of higher energy prices having weighed 
on corporate profits. State government trans -
fers increased by 7% (+€2 billion) and receipts 
from fees by 10%. In the latter case, burdens 
caused by pandemic- related restrictions now 
seem to have largely been overcome.
At 7%, expenditure growth was also strong. 
The rise in fixed asset formation and other op -
erating expenditure was even slightly stronger 
still. Inflation probably continued to play a key 
role in this. In addition, spending on social 
benefits rose substantially (+7%, or just over €1 
billion). Around one- third of this increase was 
attributable to spending on benefits for asylum 
seekers. Accommodation costs for recipients of 
unemployment benefit  II also climbed signifi -
cantly, owing to the influx of refugees from the 
war in Ukraine.
After the first three quarters of 2022, the cu -
mulated local government deficit was just 
under €1 billion, which was €5 billion lower 
than it had been a year earlier. In the final quar -
ter, a fairly large surplus is to be expected again 
solely as a result of the way income tax shares 
are booked. This remains true even given 
weaker tax revenue growth at the end of the 
year. Local governments are thus likely to post a considerable surplus for 2022 as a whole 
(2021 as a whole: +€4½ billion).
The financial result is likely to deteriorate sig -
nificantly this year. Based on the latest tax esti -
mate and after adjustment for interim legisla -
tive changes, revenue growth of 3% can be ex -
pected.8 On the expenditure side, burdens aris -
ing from high inflation are mounting. In 
addition, wage negotiations for central and 
local government employees are imminent. 
These are likely to result in much higher wage 
adjustments than in previous years. Chiefly for 
this reason, the Federal Government is budget -

Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2022, issuance in the German 
bond market stood at €148.5 billion in gross 
terms (previous month: €165.1 billion). After 
deducting redemptions, which were lower 
than in the previous month, and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds grew by €35.6 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany also rose by €1.2 billion. The funds 
raised from sales of domestic and foreign debt 
securities in the German market therefore 
amounted to €36.8 billion.The public sector issued debt securities to the 
tune of €30.9 billion net in the reporting 
month, compared with €52.0 billion in Octo -
ber. Ultimately, this was solely attributable to 
central government (€32.9 billion). It issued pri -
marily Treasury discount paper (Bubills: €10.8 
billion), but also two- year Treasury notes 
(Schätze: €6.0 billion) and ten- year and seven- 
year Federal bonds (Bunds: €5.4 billion and 
€4.0 billion, respectively). State and local gov -
ernment redeemed capital market liabilities 
worth €1.9 billion net.
Domestic enterprises augmented their capital 
market debt by €5.2 billion net in the reporting 
month, compared to €6.8 billion in the previ -
ous month. Non- financial corporations were by 
far the chief issuers of new bonds, on balance, 
but insurers and other financial intermediaries 
were also active in the market.
The outstanding volume of debt securities is -
sued by domestic credit institutions fell by €0.5 
billion in November, following a decline of €6.1 
billion in the preceding month. On balance, re -
demptions principally involved debt securities 
issued by specialised credit institutions (€2.9 
billion) and public Pfandbriefe (€1.0 billion). By 
contrast, other bank debt securities and mort -
gage Pfandbriefe were issued in the amount of 
€2.6 billion and €0.7 billion net, respectively.
Among the various investor groups, foreign in -
vestors were the main buyers in November on 
balance, acquiring German bonds worth €31.6 
billion net. The Bundesbank acquired debt 
securities amounting to €4.0 billion net, pre -
dominantly under the Eurosystem’s asset pur -
chase programmes. Domestic non-  banks and 
credit institutions purchased bonds worth €1.0 
billion and €0.2 billion net, respectively.

In the same period, the outstanding volume of 
foreign equities in the German market declined 
by €5.3 billion. On balance, shares were pur -
chased by foreign investors (€1.9 billion) and 
domestic credit institutions (€1.4 billion). By 
contrast, domestic non- banks pared back their 
equity portfolios by €8.3 billion in net terms.
Mutual funds
In November, domestic mutual funds redeemed 
their own shares to the tune of €2.6 billion 
(previous month: net issuance of €4.0 billion). 
On balance, this involved only specialised funds 
reserved for institutional investors (€3.2 billion). 
Among the various asset classes, outflows of 
capital were recorded in particular by mixed 
securities funds (€3.4 billion) and equity funds 
(€2.5 billion). By contrast, open- end real estate 
funds and bond funds recorded inflows of €1.3 
billion and €1.1 billion, respectively. Foreign 
mutual funds placed shares worth €3.7 billion 
in the German market in the reporting month. 
On balance, domestic non- banks were the pri -
mary purchasers, adding a net €1.0 billion 
worth of mutual fund shares to their portfolios. 
Domestic credit institutions acquired mutual 
fund shares for €0.5 billion net, while foreign 
investors sold domestic fund shares for €0.4 
billion on balance.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.9 billion in November 2022, up €11.2 
billion on the previous month’s level. This was 
caused by the larger surplus in the goods ac -
count and the shift to a surplus in invisible cur -
rent transactions, which comprise services as 
well as primary and secondary income.
In November, the surplus in the goods account 
grew by €6.8 billion on the month to €13.1 bil -
lion because receipts recorded a much steeper 
increase than expenditure.Mutual funds

Invisible current transactions shifted from a def -
icit of €0.6 billion in October to a surplus of 
€3.8 billion. This was mainly due to the deficit 
in the services account narrowing by €4.9 bil -
lion to €2.0 billion, with the seasonal reduction 
in travel expenditure playing a key role. In add -
ition, net receipts from primary income rose 
slightly by €0.7 billion to €12.3 billion, mainly 
owing to residents’ higher income from port -
folio investment abroad. By contrast, the deficit 
in the secondary income account widened by 
€1.2 billion to €6.5 billion, with a considerable 
contribution to this coming from higher gen -
eral government payments to the EU budget in 
connection with financing related to gross na -
tional income.
In November 2022, financial markets were 
characterised by somewhat diminishing down -
side risks to economic activity amid persistently 
high inflation. Germany’s cross- border portfolio 
investment generated net capital imports of 
€31.6 billion (October: net capital exports of 
€7.4 billion). Foreign investors increased their 
holdings of German securities by €33.1 billion, 
mainly acquiring bonds (€21.8 billion), money 
market paper (€9.8 billion) and shares (€1.9 bil -
lion). By contrast, they sold mutual fund shares 
of German enterprises to the tune of €0.4 bil -
lion. For their part, resident investors barely 
purchased foreign securities (€1.5 billion) on 
balance, adding mutual fund shares (€3.7 bil -
lion) and money market paper (€1.4 billion) to 
their portfolios, whilst offloading shares (€3.4 
billion) and bonds (€0.2 billion).
In November, transactions in financial deriva -
tives recorded outflows of €1.4 billion (Octo -
ber: €5.9 billion).Direct investment generated net capital im -
ports of €15.2 billion in November (October: 
net capital exports of €11.2 billion). Foreign en -
terprises boosted their direct investment funds 
in Germany by €14.3 billion. They mainly 
topped up their cross- border loans (€12.6 bil -
lion), predominantly through financial loans. In 
addition, foreign companies provided their af -
filiates in Germany with equity capital (€1.7 bil -
lion), with reinvested earnings accounting for 
more than half of this amount. Conversely, 
German enterprises scaled back their foreign 
direct investment by €0.9 billion. They reduced 
the volume of loans issued to foreign enter -
prises (€7.2 billion), doing so exclusively by 
granting fewer financial loans. By contrast, they 
stepped up their equity capital in affiliates 
abroad by €6.3 billion, with reinvested earnings 
playing an important role here, too.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital exports amounting to €38.5 billion in 
November (following net capital imports of 
€1.6 billion in October). All sectors contributed 
to this development. The net claims of monet -
ary financial institutions excluding the Bundes -
bank went up (€20.5 billion), as did those of 
enterprises and households (€13.4 billion), the 
Bundesbank (€3.9 billion) and, to a lesser ex -

From the monetary pillar to the monetary 
and financial analysis
In the summer of 2021, the Governing Council of the ECB, in the latest review of its monetary pol -
icy strategy, made it clear that the content of the existing “monetary analysis” had become 
increasingly broader since its last review in 2003. Against this background, the present article 
traces the development of the monetary analysis from the beginning of monetary union to the 
present.
At the beginning of monetary union, the two- pillar strategy enabled the ECB Governing Council 
to look at all information relevant to the monetary policy decision- making process in a structured 
manner. In this context, the “monetary pillar” initially focused on the money supply. However, the 
deviation of money growth from its reference value played a prominent role only at the start of 
monetary union. This was due, amongst other things, to the weakening of the relationship 
between money growth and inflation and to changes in the macroeconomic environment that 
confronted monetary policy with new challenges.
Following the global financial crisis, studies of the transmission of monetary policy measures via 
the financial system gained in importance, particularly the deployment and design of the new 
non- standard monetary policy measures introduced in the low- inflation environment. In addition, 
the monetary analysis has made valuable contributions to the identification of financial shocks 
and their impact on the real economy. As a consequence, since the recent strategy review, the 
ECB Governing Council now uses the term “monetary and financial analysis”. This analysis is also 
tasked with taking greater account of financial stability aspects than it had before.
With the pandemic, the energy crisis and high inflation, the issues to be addressed by the mon -
etary and financial analysis have shifted once again. One such issue that arises, for instance, is 
the extent to which the high money growth in 2020 could have caused the rise in inflation in 
2021-22. Our analyses suggest that the strong money growth in the first phase was driven by the 
build- up of liquidity buffers, which, in and of itself, is not inflationary. Subsequently, money growth 
and inflation were supported by aggregate demand shocks, which are likely to be attributable to 
fiscal support measures taken during the COVID-  19 pandemic, as well as by an accommodative 
monetary policy.
Against the backdrop of the currently very high inflation rates, the monetary and financial analy -
sis now needs to assess how the monetary policy tightening that began at the end of 2021 is 
affecting the financing conditions of banks, firms and households. Available data and models 
suggest that the transmission process is intact and that monetary policy tightening is being trans -
mitted to the real economy as expected. The current monetary policy stance is also confirmed to 
be appropriate when taking into account the attendant risks to financial stability. Given the stable 
situation of the euro area banking system at present, it is currently unlikely that the tightening of 
monetary policy envisaged by the ECB Governing Council will lead to any major negative feed -
back loops between the financial system and the real economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Monetary and financial 
analysis  in transition
In July 2021, the ECB Governing Council un -
veiled the results of its review of the Eurosys -
tem’s monetary policy strategy and, at the 
same time, adopted its new strategy.1 This 
strategy is designed to address the challenges 
to monetary policy that have arisen since the 
last strategy review in 2003. With regard to the 
monetary analysis, the Eurosystem used the 
strategy review to bridge the gap between 
public perception and its own analytical prac -
tice: the ECB Governing Council clarified that 
the content of the monetary analysis had be -
come increasingly broader since 2003 and that 
it would now cover financial markets and the 
financial situation of banks, firms and house -
holds. In this respect, it was only logical to re -
brand the “monetary analysis” as the “monet -
ary and financial analysis”.2
The Eurosystem’s strategy review also reflected 
the lessons for monetary policy learned from 
the global financial crisis. One key lesson was 
that there are close links between the real 
economy and the financial system, which must 
be taken into account when making monetary 
policy decisions. Against this background, the 
ECB Governing Council replaced the previous 
two- pillar structure, which was characterised 
by the coexistence of the monetary analysis 
and the economic analysis, with an integrated 
analytical framework in which monetary and 
financial analysis is an integral part. Within this 
framework, the “economic analysis” and the 
“monetary and financial analysis” no longer 
represent two separate perspectives on infla -
tion. Instead, the interrelationships between 
economic developments and monetary and 
financial developments are now explicitly taken 
into account in the assessment of inflation risks 
and in the orientation of monetary policy. The 
contents of the analysis are therefore more 
closely interlinked.
The ECB Governing Council also decided to 
give more weight to financial stability aspects in the monetary policy debate and assigned 
this topic to the monetary and financial analy -
sis.3 Although financial stability is not an inde -
pendent monetary policy objective, it is a key 
prerequisite for price stability and is also neces -
sary for effective monetary policy transmis -
sion.4 This poses great analytical challenges be -
cause the interrelationships between monetary 
policy, financial stability and macroprudential 
policy, and their interaction in various phases 
of economic and financial cycles, are complex 
and have not yet been comprehensively re -
searched.5
Against this background, the present article will 
begin by tracing the development of the mon -
etary analysis from the beginning of monetary 
union to the 2021 strategy review. It will then 
discuss the specific issues addressed by the 
monetary and financial analysis in the current 
environment of monetary policy tightening.2021 strategy

2 At the same time, the ECB Governing Council made it 
clear that the monetary and financial analysis in its new 
form would no longer be confined to the medium term 
alone. It would also increasingly look at shorter- term devel -
opments, for example as part of its analyses of the trans -
mission of monetary policy impulses through the financial 
sector.
3 Financial stability aspects were not alien to the monetary 
analysis even before the strategy review, especially since 
bank loans are the main source of trend money growth. 
However, the strategy review expanded and gave structure 
to the relevant analytical mandate.

Looking back: The evolution 
of the monetary analysis 
from the start of monetary 
union to the second strategy 
review
Diminishing importance of 
the money growth- inflation 
relationship 
From the outset, a key element of the Eurosys -
tem’s monetary policy strategy was to structure 
the assessment of risks to price stability on the 
basis of two analytical perspectives (two- pillar 
strategy). The monetary pillar encompassed the 
assessment of risks to price stability using mon -
etary indicators, while the economic pillar com -
prised a broadly based analytical approach with 
a focus on real economic developments and 
cost dynamics.6 Within the monetary pillar, the 
money supply initially played a prominent role, 
which was embodied in the formulation of a 
reference value for the growth of the broad 
monetary aggregate M3 and its annual review 
by the ECB Governing Council.7 In an environ -
ment of high uncertainty resulting from the 
introduction of the single currency, the ECB 
Governing Council sought to ensure that the 
relationship between money growth and infla -
tion was sufficiently incorporated into the as -
sessment of risks to price stability. Moreover, as 
a young institution with no track record of its 
own, the Eurosystem was concerned with 
building on the Bundesbank’s culture of stabil -
ity.8
However, even in the early years of monetary 
union, the information content of money 
growth for future inflation developments al -
ready proved to be limited in the short term. 
One reason for this was the impact on monet -
ary developments of the non-  bank sector’s 
portfolio shifts, which were unrelated to the 
aggregate demand for goods and thus to po -
tential risks to price stability.9 Subsequently, the 
reference value for money growth receded into 
the background and its annual review was dis -continued with the 2003 strategy review. The 
monetary pillar evolved into the monetary an -
alysis that – complementing the economic an -
alysis – was intended to flag medium- term to 
long- term risks to price stability.10 This took 
place due to the empirically documented rela -
tionship between the trend components of 
money growth and inflation. By contrast, cor -
responding analyses failed to identify a stable 
relationship between the short- term to 
medium- term changes in the two time series. 
The identification of the relevant long- term 
component of money growth –  the “under -
lying money growth”  – was based both on 
statistical methods and on a comprehensive 
analysis of the determinants of changes in the 
money supply, its components and counter -
parts, including at the sectoral level.11 An im -
portant reason for this comprehensive analysis 
was the challenge of identifying underlying 
money growth for the monetary policy 
decision- making process in real time.12
However, studies published since the mid-  
2000s show that the long- term relationship be -
tween money growth and inflation has also 
changed over time and weakened in an envir -
onment of low and stable inflation rates (see 
the box on pp. 18 ff.). This evidence suggests 
that, in such an environment, the long- term 
component of money growth likewise has only 
limited information content for monetary pol -

Identifying the long- term trend component of money 
growth using statistical methods in real time is fraught with 
great uncertainty. A key reason for this is that, owing to the 
absence of data on future money growth, two- sided filters 
cannot be used at the current end. However, one- sided fil -
ters, which only consider current data and past observa -
tions, are less accurate.Deutsche Bundesbank

Empirical evidence concerning the long- term relationship 
between money growth and infl  ation
The quantity theory of money predicts a 
stable, long- term 1:1 relationship between 
money growth and the growth rate of the 
price level, i.e. the infl  ation rate.1 However, 
empirical studies published over the past 
15-20 years suggest that the long- term re-
lationship between money growth and in-
fl  ation is subject to change over time.
The fi  rst set of analyses includes cross- 
sectional studies of the relationship be-
tween average money growth and infl  ation 
rates across different economies over long 
periods of time.2 De Grauwe and Polan 
(2005) take this approach in their examin-
ation of the long- term empirical relation-
ship between the growth rates of the mon-
etary aggregates M1 and M2 and of infl  a-
tion in a sample of more than 100 coun-
tries. They show that, in regressions of the 
infl  ation rate on the money growth rate, 
the coeffi   cient of money growth varies with 
the level of money growth. For average 
money growth rates below 10%, the re-
gression coeffi   cient is not signifi  cantly dif-
ferent from zero.3
Teles et al. (2016) use a similar approach to 
investigate the relationship between M1 
growth and the infl  ation rate of countries 
where average infl  ation was below 12% in 
the sample period. The theoretically ex-
pected 1:1 relationship can only be seen if 
money growth is corrected for the other 
factors contained in the quantity equation – 
real GDP growth and changes in the vel-
ocity of circulation caused by changes in 
the opportunity cost of holding money. 
However, for one subset of countries, 
whose central banks pursued an implicit or 
explicit strategy of direct infl  ation targeting, 
there was still no evidence of a quantity theory relationship even in this case, i.e. 
there appears to be no discernible link be-
tween money growth and infl  ation. These 
countries still show cross- sectional disper-
sion of (corrected) money growth. How-
ever, central banks’ stability- oriented mon-
etary policy goes hand in hand with a very 
low dispersion of infl  ation, with the result 
that the correlation between money growth 
and infl  ation tends toward zero.
The second set of approaches encompasses 
time series analyses of the relationship be-
tween money growth and infl  ation in indi-
vidual economies. Benati (2009) examines 
the relationship between the trends in the 
growth rates of various monetary aggre-
gates and infl  ation and how it changes over 
time in a number of countries using fre-
quency domain techniques. His results 
show that, although the trends in money 
growth and infl  ation exhibit common fl  uc-
tuations, the change in the infl  ation trend 
associated with a given change in the 
money growth trend can nevertheless be 
very small over long periods. Benati explains 
the results using simulations of a model in 
which the drivers of money growth and in-
fl  ation change over time. If unexpected 
changes in the velocity of money in circula-
tion – i.e. money demand shocks – domin-
ate, a given change in the trend growth of 
money has only a weak effect on infl  ation. 
Periods in which the central bank does not 
– or, due to external infl  uences, cannot – 
pursue a stability- oriented monetary policy 
lead to a sustained increase in infl  ation and 
1 See Lucas (1996), p. 665.
2 A well- known example of this analytical approach 
can be found in McCandless and Weber (1995).

money growth and to the correlation be-
tween the changes in the two variables ris-
ing towards one.4
Sargent and Surico (2011) show that, for 
the United States, the coeffi   cient of a re-
gression of the infl  ation trend on the M2 
growth trend is also signifi  cantly lower than 
one over longer periods.5 They develop a 
quantitative model in which the disappear-
ance of the 1:1 relationship between the 
long- term trends of money growth and in-
fl  ation can be explained by changes in the 
monetary policy reaction function. In their 
simulations, a credible stability- oriented 
monetary policy causes the relationship be-
tween money growth and the infl  ation that 
was previously visible in the data to become 
weaker or disappear.6
Gao et al. (2021) review developments in in-
fl  ation rates and money growth rates (M1) 
for a large group of countries, adjusted for 
short- term fl  uctuations. They correct money 
growth for changes in real GDP growth and 
the opportunity cost of holding money. The 
graphical comparison shows common fl  uc-
tuations in the two variables for some of 
the economies under review. For other 
countries, including Germany, however, the 
correlation appears to be weak.7 The 
authors attribute these differences to mon-
etary policy regime changes and support 
this hypothesis with simulations based on a 
New Keynesian macroeconomic model. In 
this model framework, the assumption of a 
time- varying infl  ation target subject to per-
sistent fl  uctuations leads to the quantity 
theory relationship between money growth 
and infl  ation becoming visible in the data, 
while the correlation is weak given a con-
stant infl  ation target.

Benati (2009), Sargent and Surico (2011) 
and Gao et al. (2021) indicate that the em-pirical relationship between money growth 
and infl  ation is strongly infl  uenced by mon-
etary policy and that the transition to a 
stability- oriented monetary policy has weak-
ened the relationship that was previously 
visible between the two variables.
Analyses of the long- term relationship be-
tween money growth and infl  ation in the 
euro area are complicated by the limited 
length of the sample period. Mandler and 
Scharnagl (2023) examine the relationship 
between growth in the monetary aggre-
gate M3 and the Harmonised Index of Con-
sumer Prices (HICP) infl  ation rate in the euro 
area using a dataset ranging from 1970 to 
2022.8 The wavelet analysis- based tools 
used for this purpose allow the relationship 
between the time series to be examined for 
4 In the model, these shocks are presented as trend in-
fl  ation shocks, see Ascari and Ropele (2009).
5 Their analysis includes regressions with fi  ltered infl  a-
tion and money growth rates based on Lucas (1980), 
and a calculation of the cross- spectral gain for fre-
quency zero using an estimated time- varying vector 
autoregressive model. Benati (2021) conducts a similar 
study for 17 countries. He interprets the results of his 
analyses using a time- varying vector autoregressive 
model as evidence of a 1:1 relationship between 
money growth and infl  ation rate trends. His regression 
analysis of the low- frequency components of money 
growth and infl  ation using the Müller and Watson 
(2018) approach provides evidence of a weakening of 
the relationship between money growth and infl  ation 
after 1985. However, the estimation uncertainty is very 
high.
6 The model assumes a 1:1 relationship between 
money growth and infl  ation in the money demand 
function, i.e. a quantity theory relationship is included 
in the model via money demand. In the case of an ag-
gressive anti- infl  ationary monetary policy response, 
however, this relationship is not refl  ected in regres-
sions of the trend components, as the central bank 
prevents the emergence of persistent movements in 
money growth.
7 Gao et al. (2021) use the Hodrick- Prescott (HP) fi  lter 
to remove short- term fl  uctuations from the time series. 
However, the properties of the HP fi  lter can create ar-
tifi  cial correlations between the two fi  ltered time ser-
ies; see, for example, Hamilton (2018).
8 This is an update of the analysis of Mandler and 
Scharnagl (2014) based on an extended data set reach-
ing as far back as possible. Another difference is a 
modifi  ed bootstrap algorithm for the signifi  cance tests 
which takes account of possible heteroscedasticity. See

Growing importance of 
analysing  the monetary policy 
transmission process
Despite the change in the assessment of the in -
formation content of monetary developments, 
the monetary analysis has remained a source of 
important information for the monetary policy 
decision-  making process. The monetary policy 
transmission process now forms a new focal 
point of the monetary analysis. This concerns 
the mechanisms through which changes in 
monetary policy instruments feed through to 
economic activity and inflation. With the global 
financial crisis, potential changes or disruptions 
to the transmission process and the use of 
novel monetary policy instruments took centre 
stage in the monetary policy debate. The mon -
etary analysis has proven to be well suited to 
providing analyses of the monetary policy 
transmission process for monetary policy 
decision- making.13The chart on p. 21 shows a stylised depiction of 
the transmission of policy rate changes. At the 
early stages of many of the monetary policy 
transmission mechanisms, monetary policy in -
struments affect financial variables.14 The im -
pact of monetary policy on banks’ funding 
costs and loan supply, i.e. on lending rates and 
other lending conditions, is of particular im -
portance for the euro area as a bank- based 
financial system. These are variables that had 
already featured prominently in the monetary 
analysis. First, in the balance sheet context, 
bank lending is the most important determin -
ant of monetary developments. Second, data 
on banks’ lending and deposit rates, as well as 
information on the loan market from the Bank Monetary analy -
sis provides 
information on 
monetary policy 
transmission 
mechanism …… as the 
monetary  and 
financial data it 
studies capture 
the early stages 
of the transmis -
sion processpossible changes over time and across fl  uc-
tuations of different lengths.9
The authors fi  nd evidence of a strong, 
stable correlation between long- term fl  uc-
tuations in the growth rate of M3 (cor-
rected for real GDP growth) and the infl  a-
tion rate with a fl  uctuation period of 24 to 
40 years.10 For these long- term fl  uctuations, 
the relationship between changes in money 
growth and infl  ation is close to the 1:1 rela-
tionship expected on the basis of quantity 
theory. Fluctuations in both time series are 
contemporaneous, i.e. there is no evidence 
of money growth leading infl  ation. The lack 
of a lead of money growth and the prob-
lems associated with estimating the rele-
vant long- term fl  uctuations in money 
growth at the current end mean that the 
long- term relationship identifi  ed provides 
very little information on the future infl  ation rate that could be utilised for monetary pol-
icy purposes.
The results described above are valid for a 
period between around 1990 and the early 
2000s. This is because the estimation of the 
relationship between the variables using the 
wavelet approach requires many data 
points before and after the time period 
under observation. This approach does not 
allow a suffi   ciently accurate assessment of 
whether the relationship has changed in 
the period thereafter.

annex in Deutsche Bundesbank (2019b).
10 The maximum length of the fl  uctuations that can 
be analysed using this procedure and this specifi  c data-
set length is 40 years.

Lending Survey (BLS), have already been used 
by the monetary analysis to assess the deter -
minants of monetary developments.
In response to the global financial crisis, the 
Euro system cut policy rates sharply. Even after 
the onset of the sovereign debt crisis, the risk 
of excessively low inflation required that policy 
rates be kept low. The observed differences be -
tween euro area countries in the pass- through 
of lower monetary policy rates to lending rates 
and the weak dynamics of lending raised the 
question of whether the monetary policy trans -
mission mechanism might be disrupted in cer -
tain countries, for example owing to loan sup -
ply restrictions. The monetary analysis was thus 
expanded to include the country- specific 
macroeconomic environment, developments in 
sovereign bond markets, the debt situation of 
the private non- financial sector and bank-  
specific factors.15With the scope for further monetary policy eas -
ing via policy rate cuts largely exhausted as it 
approached the lower bound, the Eurosystem 
implemented a series of non- standard monet -
ary policy measures, such as asset purchase 
programmes (APPs) or targeted longer- term re -
financing operations (TLTROs). The stylised de -
piction of the transmission process of an asset 
purchase programme on p. 22 illustrates how 
key transmission mechanisms function via the 
banking system.16 Other non- standard meas -
ures, such as the TLTROs, were aimed directly 
at influencing banks’ loan supply. With its ana -Heterogeneous

lyses of the transmission process, the monetary 
analysis made a valuable contribution to the 
decisions on the deployment, design and 
(re)calibration of these novel monetary policy 
instruments.17
As the period of low interest rates persisted, 
interest grew in whether there were character -
istics of monetary policy transmission that were 
specific to the low interest rate environment, 
such as the transmission of negative policy 
rates to banks’ lending and deposit rates.18 
Other topics included the possible adverse 
effects  of very low or negative policy rates and 
a very flat yield curve on the loan supply.19
For the studies on transmission, the dataset 
and the models used by the monetary analysis 
were refined, improved and expanded. The ex -
tensions to the model approaches included, 
amongst other things, approaches using micro 
data – primarily bank- specific data – and the 
use of multi- country models to capture pos -sible differences in monetary policy transmis -
sion within the euro area.20 The use of micro 
data has enabled researchers to drill deeper 
into the determinants of lending, examples of 
which include the relevance of the characteris -

tics of banks and borrowers.21 Given the im -
portance of financial markets for the transmis -
sion of non- standard monetary policy meas -
ures, such as the asset purchase programmes, 
and their impact on banks’ funding costs and 
portfolio decisions, financial market prices and 
yields have likewise become increasingly im -
portant for monetary analysis.22
With the non- standard measures, the monet -
ary analysis perspective was expanded beyond 
bank loans and lending rates to a comprehen -
sive assessment of financing conditions of the 
corporate sector. Both financial market data 
and information from the financial accounts 
play a key role in assessing the overall picture 
of firms’ financing conditions. These allow ac -
count to be taken of other forms of external 
financing, such as the issuance of bonds and 
equity, as well as of firms’ internal financing, 
which can substitute bank loans.23 In addition, 
the financial accounting data enable the debt 
situation of the private non- financial sector, 
which can also have an impact on the transmis -
sion of monetary policy impulses, to be incorp -
orated into the analysis.24
Analysis of the effects of 
financial  shocks
The monetary analysis also continued to con -
tribute to the assessment of risks to price stabil -
ity by using the information contained in finan -
cial variables such as loans, lending rates and 
financial market yields to examine the impact 
of financial shocks on the financial sector, the 
real economy and inflation.25 The financial sys -
tem is not just a mechanism that transmits and 
amplifies economic shocks originating in the 
real economy.26 As the global financial crisis, 
above all, has shown, shocks can also originate 
in the financial system, spill over from there to 
the real economy, and have a quantitatively 
significant impact on economic activity and in -
flation.27 Moreover, due to the links and inter -
actions between the real economy and the 
financial system, financial shocks can also have negative feedback effects on the financial sys -
tem through their real economic effects.28
However, such shocks are not directly observ -
able – yet they can be indirectly inferred from 
unexpected changes in economic time series. 
This requires suitable economic models. Using 
financial variables and appropriate models, the 
monetary analysis can identify financial shocks 
and assess their impact on the financial sector, 
economic activity and inflation. An example of 
such an analysis for the euro area is shown in 
the chart on p. 24. The underlying econometric 
model combines monetary and financial data 
(bank loans to non- financial corporations, the 
monetary aggregate M3, the lending rate, the 
yield on government bonds, and the difference Comprehensive

25 The prevailing paradigm in macroeconomics assumes 
that an economy converges towards a long- term “steady 
state”, deviations from which are caused by shocks, i.e. ex -
ogenous impulses affecting the economy.
26 These mechanisms are based, for example, on asym -
metric information, incomplete contracts and incentive 
problems. These frictions lead, amongst other things, to an 
external finance premium, i.e. a premium on external finan -
cing compared with internal financing and credit rationing. 
The external financing premium and the availability of 
loans depend, amongst other things, on the borrower’s 
capital. A decline in equity as a result of a slowing econ -
omy can lead to a deterioration in firms’ financing condi -
tions, which in turn adversely affects the real economy. 
These mechanisms are discussed in, for example, Bernanke 
et al. (1999), Gertler and Gilchrist (2018) and Niepelt 
(2019), Chapter 8.3.
27 See, for example, Christiano et al. (2010) and Prieto et 
al. (2016).
28 For an overview, see, for example, Claessens and Kose 
(2018). One example is a shock- induced deterioration in 
the real economy’s financing conditions that causes eco -
nomic activity to contract. The increased insolvency risk 
that could ensue may require banks to increase their loan 
loss provisions, impair their loan supply, and thus further 
worsen financing conditions in the economy. Feedback ef -
fects are also possible in the case of real economic shocks, 
whose effects on the financial system can, in turn, spill over 
to the real economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

between the yields on corporate bonds and 
government bonds (excess bond premium)) 
with real economic data, real gross domestic 
product (GDP), and the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP). It thus allows selected 
financial shocks and their impact on the real 
economy to be identified.29 A shadow rate is 
used as an indicator of monetary policy (see 
the box on pp. 25ff.). Two financial shocks are 
identified – a loan supply shock and a money 
demand shock. The loan supply shock repre -
sents a change in banks’ lending behaviour for 
given economic fundamentals captured by the 
other variables.30 The money demand shock 
leads to a change in money holdings and to 
portfolio shifts between riskier assets and 
money for given economic conditions. It can 
also be interpreted as an uncertainty shock in 
which heightened uncertainty in the economy 
in general or in the financial markets specifically 
triggers a build- up of liquidity buffers and shifts 
into safe assets.
The adjacent chart shows the effects of the 
two financial shocks and other macroeconomic 
shocks on selected variables up to the end of 
2019. The black lines represent the deviations 
of the annual growth rates of the monetary 
aggre gate M3, loans to non- financial corpor -
ations, real GDP , and HICP and of the shadow 
rate level from a hypothetical simulated model 
scenario in which no economic shocks hit the 
euro area. These deviations are decomposed 
into the contributions of the various shocks. 
The chart shows that positive and negative 
loan supply shocks during the credit boom in 
the second half of the 2000s and during the 
European sovereign debt crisis had a quantita -
tively relevant impact on loan and money 
growth, respectively. Similar effects on GDP Loan supply

BVAR model for estimating the effects of macroeconomic 
shocks on growth in gross domestic product, loans and the 
money supply and on the infl  ation rate
The chart on p. 24 shows the results of a 
Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) 
model estimated for the euro area.1 The 
model contains nine variables: real gross 
domestic product (GDP), the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), loans to 
non- fi  nancial corporations, the lending rate, 
the euro area shadow rate of Geiger and 
Schupp (2018), the average yield on fi  ve- 
year euro area government bonds, the 
monetary aggregate M3, the difference be-
tween the yield on corporate bonds and a 
risk- free interest rate with the same matur-
ity (excess bond premium),2 and the yield 
on fi  ve- year US Treasuries. The shadow rate 
is used as a composite indicator of the 
Euro system’s standard and non- standard 
monetary policy.3 The US Treasury yield is 
used to control for possible infl  uences from 
the US or global capital markets.
The model is estimated using quarterly data 
covering the period from the second quar-
ter of 2000 to the fourth quarter of 2019.4 
With the exception of the interest rates and 
the interest rate spread, all of the variables 
are entered into the estimation as log levels. 
The estimation is carried out using the ap-
proach in Giannone et al. (2015).
The residuals of the model contain the eco-
nomically interpretable “structural shocks”, 
which are responsible for the fl  uctuations of 
the variables around the model’s long- term 
equilibrium, in the form of linear combin-
ations. In order to estimate the impact of 
the shocks on the model variables, the 
shocks need to be identifi  ed on the basis of 
assumptions. In the analysis presented here, 
shocks are identifi  ed through the use of 
sign restrictions, i.e. assumptions about the direction in which a shock moves the model 
variables.
Five economic shocks are identifi  ed. The 
sign restrictions for each of the shocks are 
shown in the table on p. 26. The aggregate 
demand shock comprises exogenous 
changes in the demand for goods due to 
changes in consumer preferences or gov-
ernment spending. For the monetary vari-
ables, it is assumed that the demand shock 
leads to greater demand for loans, and thus 
to a rise in both the volume of loans and 
the lending rate, as well as to an increase in 
the money supply (additional money cre-
ation through loans, increased nominal 
money demand due to a higher price level 
and higher real income). The aggregate 
supply shock comprises, amongst other 
things, shocks that affect fi  rms’ production 
technologies or mark- ups, and also energy 
price shocks. The loan supply shock repre-
1 This model is an extended and modifi  ed version of 
that in Mandler and Scharnagl (2020a) and Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2020b). The extension to include the 
money demand shock originates from Mandler (2021).
2 This indicator was devised by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek 
(2012) and is constructed so as to avoid possible dis-
tortions caused by duration mismatches. Gilchrist and 
Mojon (2018) calculate corresponding indicators for 
the euro area countries; see https://publications.
banque-france.fr/en/economic-and-financial- 
publications-working-papers/credit-risk-euro-area.
3 The shadow rate is calculated using a term structure 
model. It is the hypothetical short- term interest rate 
absent the zero lower bound. The shadow rate is infl  u-
enced by monetary policy measures that affect the 
yield curve, even if these measures do not affect the 
actual market short- term interest rate due to the zero 
lower bound; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2017d).
4 Ending the estimation before the COVID- 19 pan-
demic is intended to avoid potential distortions caused 
by the pandemic; see Lenza and Primiceri (2022). 
Nevertheless, the shock decomposition includes the 
period from the fi  rst quarter of 2000 until the third 
quarter of 2022, i.e. the analysis assumes that the re-
lationships estimated for the preceding period con-
tinue to hold true from 2020 onwards.Deutsche Bundesbank

sents exogenous changes in banks’ supply 
of loans. An increase in the loan supply 
leads, amongst other things, to a decline in 
the lending rate and an increase in real GDP , 
the volume of loans, and the money sup-
ply.5 The negative response of the excess 
bond premium to the loan supply shock as-
sumes that fi  rms respond to an expansion 
in the loan supply by substituting credit 
fi  nancing for bond fi  nancing. Therefore, the 
supply of corporate bonds declines and the 
yield on corporate bonds falls relative to the 
yield on government bonds. The monetary 
policy shock is a deviation of the monetary 
policy indicator – in this case, the shadow 
rate  – from the monetary policy reaction 
function estimated in the model, i.e. from 
the systematic relationship between the 
policy indicator and the other variables in 
the model. In the case of a restrictive (posi-
tive) monetary policy shock, monetary pol-
icy is thus more restrictive than the model 
would predict given the other variables and 
other shocks. Alongside the sign restrictions 
typically used to identify a monetary policy 
shock, the table shows that the excess 
bond premium is also assumed to rise fol-
lowing a restrictive monetary policy shock.6 In addition to the sign restrictions shown in 
the table, it is assumed that the coeffi   cients 
of contemporaneous GDP and the price 
level in the equation for the shadow rate 
are positive, which causes the central bank 
to respond immediately to an increase in 
output or prices by tightening monetary 
policy.7 A money demand shock is identifi  ed 
as the fi  fth structural shock. This leads to a 
rise in money holdings, the government 
bond yield, and the excess bond premium. 
Money holders sell off non- monetary assets 
in order to increase their money balances. 
The positive effect on the excess bond pre-
mium assumes that there is a relatively 
larger reduction in demand for risky assets 
compared with low- risk and risk- free assets, 
such as government bonds. In addition to 
portfolio reallocation, it is assumed that 
money holders will also increase their 
money holdings by making fewer pur-
chases, thereby reducing output and the 
price level. Monetary policy responds to the

defl  ationary effect of the money demand 
shock through easing, i.e. by accommodat-
ing the increased demand for money. 
Alongside this interpretation of the money 
demand shock, which is based on money 
demand theory, there is another alternative 
interpretation whereby economic agents re-
spond to an exogenous rise in macroeco-
nomic uncertainty: this leads to a reduction 
in the demand for goods and services, a 
build- up of precautionary funds, and a shift 
from risky and less liquid assets to money.
In contrast to the model described on 
pp.  41ff., an independent loan demand 
shock is not identifi  ed. As shown on p. 42, 
a loan demand shock results in changes in 
the volume of loans and the lending rate, 
both in the same direction. In the model 
presented here, this condition is fulfi  lled by 
the aggregate demand shock. The aggre-
gate supply shock and the money demand 
shock may also fundamentally be con-
sidered to be components of a loan de-
mand shock, as their identifi  cation assump-
tions do not exclude the possibility of loan 
volumes and lending rates moving in the 
same direction. Another difference from 
the model on pp. 41ff. is that the loan sup-
ply shock defi  ned therein also encompasses 
the monetary policy shock defi  ned in the 
model described here, as it leads to the 
loan volume and lending rate moving in op-
posite directions.
Economic shocks move the variables out of 
the long- term equilibrium to which the 
model converges. The effects of a shock 
may persist beyond the period in which it 
occurs, as the changes in the variables 
caused directly by the shock are transmitted 
to subsequent periods via the model dy-
namics (shock propagation). In each period, 
the deviation of the actual observed vari-
ables from their hypothetical paths if the 
shocks had not occurred thus incorporates the effects of the current shocks as well as 
the persisting effects of previous shocks 
and can be assigned to the categories of 
shocks described above. The chart on p. 24 
shows the decomposition of the deviations 
of the observed variables from a hypothet-
ical scenario in which the shocks do not 
occur into the contributions of the various 
economically interpretable shocks. As the 
model contains nine variables but identifi  es 
only fi  ve shocks, four additional unidenti-
fi  ed and thus uninterpretable shocks affect 
the variables.
The Bayesian estimation produces a prob-
ability distribution of the shock contribu-
tions. However, the charts show only the 
stacked medians of the contributions of the 
various shocks and do not provide any in-
formation on their statistical distribution. In 
order to assert that a particular shock 
played an important role in the develop-
ment of a particular variable at specifi  c 
points in time, the estimation uncertainty in 
the distribution of the shock contributions 
must also be taken into account. If the dis-
tribution of a shock contribution is very 
wide, it is not possible to make any defi  ni-
tive assertions regarding its direction, even 
if the median is relatively large. As in Mand-
ler and Scharnagl (2019), this analysis uses 
percentiles of the distribution of the shock 
contributions and the ratio of the posterior 
probabilities of a positive versus negative 
contribution (or vice versa) of a shock at a 
given point in time for the assessment. The 
main article discusses results that can be 
considered suffi   ciently reliable on the basis 
of these analytical tools. One example in 
which the high degree of estimation uncer-
tainty prevents conclusions from being de-
rived with confi  dence is the effect of the 
loan supply shock on loan growth since 
2020 in the chart on p. 29. Although, at fi  rst 
glance, the median contribution suggests 
that the loan supply shock had a quantita-Deutsche Bundesbank

growth and inflation are also evident.31 In 
addition , the analysis shows that positive 
(uncertainty- related) money demand shocks 
occurred during the initial phase of the global 
financial crisis, which were clearly reflected in 
GDP growth and inflation.32 These are valuable 
insights that helped decision-  makers to assess 
both the risks to price stability and the trans -
mission process.
Questions of monetary 
and financial analysis in the 
current environment
High M3 growth at the 
outbreak  of the COVID-  19 
pandemic 
The macro models used to identify financial 
shocks are also contributing to the interpret -
ation of economic developments in the current 
environment. Upon the onset of the COVID-  19 pandemic in 2020, the annual growth rate of 
the monetary aggregate M3 increased to more 
than 12% before receding over the course of 
2021 and 2022. The inflation rate rose steadily 
over the same period. This raises the question 
of a possible relationship between the increase 
in the M3 growth rate and the increase in the 
inflation rate.
This question can be analysed in the empirical 
macro model presented on pp. 23 ff. and in the 
box on pp. 25ff. The monetary aggregate M3 
and the price level are endogenous variables, 
i.e. they are explained within the model. Their

positiontively signifi  cant impact, the uncertainty 
surrounding its contribution is so great that 
the model ultimately does not provide any 
reliable evidence that loan supply shocks 
played a signifi  cant role during this period.8
8 While the other results described in the main text 
prove to be qualitatively robust for different variations 
of the model (use of the monetary aggregate M1 in-
stead of M3, extension to include an equity price 
index, use of another shadow rate), this is not the case 
for the contribution of the loan supply shock in the re-
cent past. For example, the model does not indicate 
any relevant median effect of loan supply shocks from 
2020 onwards if, instead of the shadow rate of Geiger 
and Schupp (2018), that of Wu and Xia (2016) is used.
31 Further studies on the impact of loan supply shocks in 
the euro area or in the individual Member States include 
Bijster bosch and Falagiarda (2015), Gambetti and Musso 
(2017), Hristov et al. (2012) and Mandler and Scharnagl 
(2020a).
32 Qualitatively similar results can be obtained if the analy -
sis is carried out using the monetary aggregate M1 instead 
of M3. However, the money demand shocks and their im -
pact tend to be stronger for M1. This is likely because 
uncertainty- related portfolio shifts are particularly reflected 
in the most liquid components of the monetary aggregate.Deutsche Bundesbank

dynamics, in conjunction with the other en -
dogenous variables, thus result from the econ -
omy’s responses to macroeconomic shocks. 
How the two variables react, and thus their ob -
served correlation, depends on the nature of 
the shock. A good way to obtain an under -
standing of money growth and the inflation 
rate in recent years is therefore to decompose, 
as described above, the deviations of the vari -
ables from a baseline scenario into the contri -
butions of different macroeconomic shocks. 
The adjacent chart continues the shock decom -
position on p. 23 from the first quarter of 2020 
to the third quarter of 2022. In addition to the 
two financial shocks described above (loan 
supply shock and money demand shock), it 
also shows the estimated contributions of ag -
gregate demand shocks and aggregate supply 
shocks as well as monetary policy shocks 
(which are discussed on pp. 25ff.). The effects 
of the shocks are interpreted individually below.
According to the model, money demand 
shocks made a marked contribution to the ac -
celeration of money growth in 2020. These are 
likely to reflect, in particular, the heightened 
uncertainty and the build- up of liquidity re -
serves at the outbreak of the COVID-  19 pan -
demic. The increased demand for liquidity was 
accommodated by monetary policy, as as -
sumed in the model. This is represented by the 
negative contributions of the money demand 
shocks to the shadow rate. These liquidity buf -
fers were later reduced again, which is re -
flected in the fact that the contributions of the 
money demand shock to money growth de -
cline and eventually enter into negative terri -
tory. The effect of the money demand shocks 
on the inflation rate is negative at first, as im -
plied by the identification assumptions, but 
turns positive as from the end of 2021.33 At the

positive contribution of the money demand shock to infla -
tion towards from the end of 2021 onward largely reflects 
a base effect resulting from the, in the short term, negative

above the baseline while inflation falls below 
the baseline of the model. Towards the end of 
the period under review, money growth de -
clines as inflation rises. These dynamics illus -
trate the fundamentally countervailing effects 
of the money demand shock on inflation and 
the monetary aggregate.
In the short run, money growth and inflation 
are assumed to be affected in the same direc -
tion by monetary policy shocks. Monetary pol -
icy shocks are deviations of the shadow rate, 
which is used as a monetary policy indicator, 
from its “normal” estimated response to the 
other variables.34 According to the estimations, 
monetary policy has been particularly accom -
modative compared with the model since mid- 
2020. This has raised both money growth and 
the inflation rate since mid- 2021. At this stage, 
however, the overall money growth rate had 
already begun to decline again. The expansion -
ary monetary policy shocks from mid- 2020 are 
reflected in the chart showing the shadow 
rate.35 Although the model does not indicate 
expansionary monetary policy at the end of the 
period under review, the monetary policy 
shocks that occurred up to that point may con -
tinue to have a positive impact on money 
growth and inflation for some time to come.
Unusually strong growth in aggregate demand 
(positive demand shocks) was a further com -
mon driver of money growth and inflation. The 
shock decomposition of real GDP growth 
shows that these positive demand shocks oc -
curred between mid- 2020 and mid- 2021. This 
suggests that these shocks could reflect fiscal 
support measures during the COVID-  19 pan -
demic. The impact of these demand shocks on 
money growth and inflation persists up to the 
current end. Supply- side disruptions, i.e. aggre -
gate supply shocks, were also increasingly play -
ing a role in the rise in inflation in 2022, im -
pacting positively on the inflation rate, but, at 
the same time, according to the estimations, 
tending to adversely affect money growth at 
the current end.These results illustrate that the correlation be -
tween money growth and inflation at a given 
point in time depends on which economic 
shocks are particularly important for the dy -
namics of the two variables. The increase in 
money growth in 2020 was initially driven 
mainly by money demand shocks, which, how -
ever, impacted negatively on the price level. It 
was only in the subsequent phase that aggre -
gate demand shocks and monetary policy 
shocks became more important for money 
growth; taken in isolation, they caused both 
money growth and inflation to rise.36 However, 
information on the underlying shocks can be 
obtained only if monetary developments are 
analysed holistically along with real economic 
and financial variables. Focusing on a money 
growth- inflation relationship that assumes a 
stable positive correlation between the two 
variables can therefore lead to misjudgements.
The results of the model can be related to the 
consolidated balance sheet of the euro area MFI 
sector. One of the main reasons for the high 
money growth during the pandemic was the 
strong expansion in securities held for monetary 
policy purposes by the Eurosystem in the con -
text of the low inflation environment; the other 
was the increased new issuance of government Expansionary

34 The “normal” monetary policy response also includes 
the response of the shadow rate to the other macroeco -
nomic shocks.
35 The chart for the shadow rate shows a pronounced re -
strictive monetary policy shock in the second quarter of 
2020, i.e. a more restrictive monetary policy than the nor -
mal monetary policy response to the other variables. The 
fall in output in the second quarter of 2020 was an ex -
treme event compared with the history of GDP movements 
over the estimation period. The estimated monetary policy 
reaction function implicitly contained in the model predicts 
a stronger easing of monetary policy, i.e. a greater decline 
in the shadow rate than actually occurred, in response to 
this sharp decline in output. The zero lower bound and 
limits for possible monetary policy asset purchase pro -
grammes would probably not have allowed for monetary 
policy easing to the extent predicted by the model. In add -
ition, the chart shows that, as early as in the following 
quarter, the Eurosystem provided an accommodative im -
pulse above and beyond the monetary policy response pre -
dicted by the model.
36 As the expiring money demand shocks and a number of 
other shocks overcompensated for the impact of the ag -
gregate demand and monetary policy shocks on the devi -
ation of money growth from the baseline, the deviation in 
the period of rising inflation is largely declining in the chart.Deutsche Bundesbank

bonds to raise funding for fiscal support meas -
ures during the pandemic. The interplay be -
tween expansionary fiscal and monetary policy is 
reflected in the model results, on the one hand, 
in the positive aggregate demand shocks and 
their impact on GDP growth and inflation.37 On 
the other, it is also part of the expansionary 
monetary policy shocks and their effects.38
Bank loans to the private sector were the 
second major counterpart to the changes in 
the monetary aggregate M3 since 2020. The 
positive relationship between loan growth and 
money growth reflects the money creation pro -
cess and can, in principle, be caused by any of 
the shocks contained in the model.39 In the 
chart on p. 24, the close relationship between 
loans and the monetary aggregate over the 
period up until 2020 is reflected in the fact that 
the contributions of the various shocks to the 
growth of loans to non- financial corporations 
and to M3 growth are often of similar relative 
importance and tend to point in the same di -
rection for both variables.
Overall, the model shows that monetary policy 
shocks and aggregate demand shocks have 
played an important role in joint developments 
in money growth and inflation, while money 
demand shocks tended to cause countervailing 
developments of both variables. However, the 
model is unable to assign a significant part of 
the upward deviation in the current inflation 
rate to any of the identified shocks. This is be -
cause, amongst other things, the model does 
not use a broad range of determinants of the 
inflation process as a basis (for example, it does 
not include energy prices), but instead focuses 
on financial variables, consistent with the focus 
of the monetary and financial analysis.Transmission of monetary 
policy  tightening
Overview
As described above, one of the main tasks of 
the monetary and financial analysis in its cur -
rent form is to assess the progress and degree 
of monetary policy transmission in the early 
stages of the monetary policy transmission pro -
cess described on p. 21. Whilst a large number 
of the above- mentioned transmission analyses 
were conducted in an environment of very low 
inflation rates, economic conditions have now 
changed and, as a result, so too has the mon -
etary policy stance. The economic downturn in 
2020 and the rise in inflation in 2021 were 
shaped by the COVID-  19 pandemic. In 2022, 
macroeconomic developments were also in -
creasingly driven by the outbreak of the war in 
Ukraine and its economic repercussions. Sharp 
rises in energy and food prices, continuing dis -
ruption to global supply chains and the post-  
pandemic recovery in demand led to inflation 
reaching new highs over the course of the year.

37 A demand shock caused by an expansionary fiscal pol -
icy impulse leads ceteris paribus to an increase in GDP and 
in the price level compared with the baseline, to which the 
central bank responds by tightening monetary policy. In the 
model, however, this tightening is not strong enough to 
prevent an increase in the money supply, which means that 
the fiscal policy shock is temporarily and partially accom -
modated by monetary policy. The monetary policy accom -
modation of a demand shock is thus also reflected in the 
contributions of the demand shock to the decomposition 
of money growth.
38 If the central bank responds to an expansionary fiscal 
policy impulse by tightening its monetary policy to a lesser 
extent than it would according to its estimated reaction 
function, GDP and the price level rise relative to the base -
line, while the shadow rate falls relative to it. This is de -
picted in the model as an expansionary monetary policy im -
pulse. Since the model does not contain any fiscal policy 
variables, fiscal policy impulses cannot be isolated from the 
monetary policy and aggregate demand shocks. For infor -
mation on identifying fiscal policy shocks, see, for example, 
Ramey (2016).
39 For more information on the money creation process, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b). The assumptions made 
in order to estimate the aggregate demand shock and the 
monetary policy shock assume a positive correlation be -
tween money growth and loan growth, while the assump -

a rapid tightening of the monetary policy 
stance in the euro area. In the first half of 2022, 
the ECB Governing Council discontinued net 
asset purchases; in July, it reversed its interest 
rates. Since then, key interest rates have risen 
by a total of 250 basis points.
In this environment, the monetary and financial 
analysis must address three core issues. First, it 
must assess whether banks pass on the monet -
ary policy- induced rise in market interest rates 
to borrowers to the necessary extent. Second, 
it must evaluate whether the tightening of 
financing conditions has the intended dampen -
ing effect on the demand for loans among 
households and firms. And third, the monetary 
and financial analysis must also keep a close 
eye on the loan supply side. This is because 
very loose lending policies among banks could 
weaken the impact of monetary policy tighten -
ing, whilst excessively restrictive lending could 
lead to undesirable feedback loops between 
the financial system and the real economy. By analysing these issues, it is possible to adjust 
the monetary policy stance to a changing en -
vironment in good time, where necessary.
The dashboard shown above provides an initial 
condensed overview of the assessment of trans -
mission, outlining how financing conditions for 
the private non- financial sector develop across 
the monetary policy transmission process. For 
this purpose, it contains upstream indicators 
that directly address financing conditions for the 
money and capital markets, as well as down -
stream indicators that capture the subsequent 
stages of monetary policy transmission and 
mainly reflect financing conditions for banks’ 
lending business. The dashboard shows in -
creases in almost all indicators for 2022, with 
the tightening observed since December 2021 
being more pronounced for upstream indicators 
than for downstream indicators. This is due to 
the fact that upstream indicators respond quickly 
to monetary policy impulses, whereas the cor -

typically occur with a time lag. This is illustrated 
particularly clearly by the growth in bank loans 
to non- financial corporations, which remained 
virtually unchanged over the course of 2022.
In addition to the summarised depiction of 
financing conditions, the dashboard shows the 
results of an empirical analysis in which changes 
in the indicators are conditioned to the devel -
opment of the macroeconomic environment. 40 
Specifically, this means that changes in the indi -
vidual indicators are regressed on current and 
past values of the output and inflation gaps.41 
These estimation models can be used to assess 
the degree to which changes in the indicators 
are consistent with macroeconomic develop -
ments.42 It is clear that, taking into account an 
area of uncertainty (grey lines), the tightening 
of financing conditions observed since Decem -
ber 2021 is broadly in line with the develop -
ments in the macroeconomic environment. 
This is due, in particular, to the high inflation 
dynamics. Looking at the point forecasts, the 
actual tightening shown by the upstream indi -
cators close to the financial market is, in some 
cases, slightly more pronounced than predicted 
by the models. This is likely to be attributable, 
in particular, to markets’ reappraisal of the an -
ticipated monetary policy response to the 
macroeconomic environment. In the case of 
the downstream indicators, which mainly re -
flect banking conditions, the increases have 
thus far been largely in line with expectations.
Pass- through of higher interest rates in 
banks’ lending business
In a bank- based economy such as the euro 
area, the banking sector’s responses to adjust -
ments in the monetary policy stance have a 
crucial influence on developments in financing 
conditions for the private non- financial sector. 
Banks pass on rising financial market interest 
rates in their lending business to cover their 
own higher funding costs. As the upper chart 
on p. 34 shows, banks’ funding costs, which 
had been extremely low for a long time, have 
risen significantly since the beginning of 2022. This upward movement was mainly due to the 
sharp rise in yields on bank debt securities, 
which, in turn, followed the general trend of 
money market and capital market interest 
rates.
Higher interest rates in the financial markets led 
banks to significantly raise interest rates, which 
had been close to all- time lows up until that 
point, on loans to non- financial corporations 
and loans to households for house purchase. 
This occurred with a time lag. Empirical models 
based on historical interrelationships show 
that, for loans to non- financial corporations 
and loans to households for house purchase in 
the euro area, interest rates are generally 
passed through almost entirely and that this 
process is largely concluded after one year. In 
the case of loans to non- financial corporations, 
developments in market interest rates are 
mostly passed on within the first few months, Developments in

40 It is assumed that market participants form their expect -
ations about future monetary policy using simple rules, 
such as the Orphanides rule; see Hartmann and Smets 
(2018), pp. 21f. and Orphanides (2003). If the expected 
output gap and/ or the expected inflation gap are positive, 
market participants expect rising interest rates and vice 
versa.
41 The estimates are based on autoregressive distributed 
lag (ARDL) models of orders p and q. Specifically, this 
means that the dependent variable (change in the indicator 
compared with the previous period) is regressed on p of its 
own lags as well as on contemporaneous values and q lags 
of additional explanatory variables. Within the scope of this 
analysis, the expected output gap (deviation of expected 
annualised GDP growth at time t from potential growth 
approximated using expected growth in six to ten years) 
and the expected inflation gap (expected inflation in one 
year minus the inflation target) serve as explanatory vari -
ables and describe the macroeconomic environment. Ex -
pected values are measured using monthly consensus fore -
casts, which, using the method developed by Knüppel and 
Vladu (2016), are converted into annual rates at times t 
and t + 12. The lag lengths are selected on the basis of the 
Schwarz- Bayes information criterion.
42 As the upstream indicators are entered into the estima -
tion at a weekly frequency, the time dimension of the 
monthly data from the macroeconomic indicators is trans -
formed accordingly. For the weekly figures on the upstream 
indicators, this means that only lagged values of the macro -
economic indicators are entered into the regression and 
these values are kept constant over every week of a given 
month. This approach is consistent with the fact that the 
information and data on economic conditions are only 
available with a certain lag, which means that, using this 
estimation procedure, the forward- looking financial market 
variables in a given week are ultimately responding to 
macroeconomic data from the previous month. For infor -
mation on a similar approach, see Brave and Kelley (2017).Deutsche Bundesbank

while these take longer to pass through to 
loans to households for house purchase.43 In 
2022, lending rates in the euro area as a whole 
developed essentially in line with the historical 
patterns indicated by the models (see the lower 
adjacent chart). With a few exceptions, this 
also applies to the interest rate pass- through in 
the four largest Member States.
The models suggest that lending rates will rise 
further in the coming months. First, it is likely 
that part of the increase in financial market 
interest rates over the past few months is not 
yet reflected in lending rates, but will have a 
delayed impact. Second, a further hike in lend -
ing rates can be expected if market interest 
rates continue to rise. With regard to lending 
rates, the models do not yet provide any rea -
son to expect increasing heterogeneity among 
the euro area countries.
Development of financing needs of firms 
and households
Experience shows that the decline in demand 
for loans among non- financial corporations 
and households as a result of higher financing 
costs requires more time. For instance, some 
borrowers frontload their borrowing activity in 
anticipation of rising interest rates. In addition, 
in a weakening economy, firms’ internal finan -
cing options diminish, which initially increases 
their needs for external financing and thus also 
their demand for bank loans.44 Furthermore, in 
the current environment, the increasingly 
broad- based, massive rise in prices, aggregate 
supply bottlenecks and acute liquidity short -
ages among some firms in the energy sector 
have led to dynamic loan demand despite 
higher financing costs in the wake of monetary 
policy tightening. Financing volumes thus re -
mained high for a time or even grew further. A 
weakening was not observed until the final 
quarter of 2022, meaning that the tightening 
of the monetary policy stance is likely to grad -Models suggest

ually achieve its intended impact. In the current 
environment, it is difficult to say whether these 
developments in lending are in line with histor -
ical patterns or should be regarded as excep -
tional. This is because the euro area data avail -
able for such analyses do not contain periods 
with similarly high inflation rates. According to 
the estimation results presented in the dash -
board, the developments in lending can be re -
garded as unremarkable taking into account 
the broad area of uncertainty in 2022.
With regard to loans to households, signs of a 
slowdown were already emerging as early as in 
the middle of the year. Net lending decreased 
significantly from June 2022 (see the adjacent 
chart). The corresponding year- on- year growth 
rate has declined moderately since mid- 2022. 
There was a particular drop in the previously 
buoyant demand for loans for house purchase, 
which is the most significant sub- item of loans 
to households. In this case, the rise in lending 
rates led to a significantly higher interest bur -
den for newly issued and renegotiated loans. 
From the second quarter of 2022, the banks 
surveyed by the BLS identify the rise in the 
interest rate level as a factor dragging on de -
mand. Furthermore, they cite both the decline 
in consumer confidence as well as the signifi -
cant deterioration in the housing market out -
look as perceived by borrowers as reasons for 
the dampened demand (see the chart on p. 39). 
Indeed, in the euro area, there are mounting 
signs of a turnaround in the housing market, 
which boomed during the low interest rate 
period.
The picture is more complex for non- financial 
corporations, as they generally have access to 
multiple forms of external financing. Against 
the backdrop of the tightening of monetary 
policy in the euro area from the beginning of 
2022, there was an increasing shift within ex -
ternal financing from market financing to bank 
financing (see the upper adjacent chart). The 
associated reduction in financing by debt secur -
ities, which had played an increasingly import -
ant role in corporate financing in the wake of the global financial crisis, was particularly pro -
nounced (see the box on pp. 37 f.). This was 
mainly due to the divergence in financing costs. 
Interest rates on debt securities have risen 
sharply since the turn of 2021-22 owing to the 
close linkages between interest rates in the 
financial markets. Bank lending rates, however, 
in line with the historical patterns outlined in 
the above- mentioned interest rate pass-  
through models, responded with a certain time 
lag (see the lower adjacent chart). As a result, 
obtaining financing via debt securities became 
increasingly unattractive. Overall, both the

non- financial corporations increased clearly 
over the course of 2022.
Another key factor that sustained demand for 
bank loans despite rising interest rates was the 
decline in internal financing, i.e. financing from 
internally generated payment surpluses within 
firms. The main driver of this development was 
higher dividend payments by firms, which re -
duced the available cash flow. The euro area 
firms participating in the Survey on the Access 
to Finance (SAFE) also indicated a stronger in -
crease in production costs despite higher sales, 
which resulted in mounting reports of declining 
profits. At the same time, financing needs for working capital and inventories were relatively 
high and investment activity also remained 
comparatively robust in nominal terms. A gap 
therefore opened up between the need for 
financing and internally generated funds, which 
was closed by taking out bank loans.
Against this backdrop, banks’ aggregate lend -
ing to non-  financial corporations remained 
high into the summer. Alongside the aforemen -
tioned reasons, government- sponsored large-  
volume loans to firms in the energy sector also 
played a role.45 However, a slowdown in non- 
financial corporations’ demand for loans can 
also be observed at the current end. Net lend -
ing has been in decline since September, and 
came to a standstill in November (see the chart 
on p. 35). As a result, the annual growth rate 
went down moderately in November from a 
high level. The banks participating in the BLS 
expected a decline in loan demand in the final 
quarter of 2022 (see the adjacent chart above). 
A drop in firms’ financing needs for fixed in -
vestment was cited as the main factor damp -
ening demand, in line with the deteriorating 
economic and geopolitical environment. On 
top of this, there is the rising lending rate, 
which makes some investments no longer 
seem lucrative. In the third quarter of 2022, for 
example, BLS banks for the first time cited 
higher financing costs as a dampening factor in 
corporate demand for loans. Furthermore, it is 
also possible that the now easing supply bottle -
necks will lead to lower financing needs for 
working capital and inventories.
Developments in banks’ loan supply
It is crucial that the monetary and financial an -
alysis also keeps a close eye on developments 
in the loan supply, as changes in banks’ lending 
policies can accelerate or weaken the impact of 
monetary policy tightening. The BLS provides … while firms’

Shift in the debt fi  nancing structure of non- fi  nancial 
corporations  from bank loans to debt securities
The expanded monetary and fi  nancial an-
alysis takes into account, amongst other 
things, that the importance of alternative 
debt fi  nancing relative to bank loans1 for 
non- fi  nancial corporations (NFCs) in the 
euro area has been growing for some time 
now.2 Debt securities have traditionally 
been the main alternative to bank loans for 
fi  nancing investments in non- fi  nancial assets.3 
The role of debt securities has increased 
markedly since the start of the millennium. 
However, this development has taken place 
with temporary fl  uctuations and a certain 
degree of heterogeneity at the country level 
(see the chart on p. 38).
The share of debt securities in non- fi  nancial 
corporate debt in Germany and Italy rose 
almost continuously from only around 5% 
in 1999 to just over 23% and 19%, respect-
ively, at the beginning of 2022. In Germany, 
this was due, in particular, to a relatively 
strong issuance of debt securities. In Italy, 
by contrast, the decline in bank loans in the 
wake of the European debt crisis was the 
main driving factor. In the case of NFCs in 
Spain, the share of debt securities initially 
fell during the bank credit boom at the be-
ginning of the millennium to just 2% at the 
end of 2005. Since then, however, the 
share of debt securities has grown steadily, 
amounting to just over 18% at the begin-
ning of 2022. Both the strong issuance of 
debt securities and the signifi  cant decline in 
bank loans following the global fi  nancial 
crisis contributed to this. In France, the al-
most 30% share at the beginning of 1999 
was already very high compared with other 
countries. Debt securities initially became 
increasingly important up to 2004 on the 
back of strong issuance. Net issuance then 
came more or less to a standstill by the end of 2008. This, combined with strong bor-
rowing from banks, resulted in a declining 
debt securities share. From 2009 onwards, 
however, fi  nancing through debt securities 
rebounded signifi  cantly, thus appreciably 
pushing up its share once more. Stronger 
demand for bank loans caused a sideways 
movement from the end of 2013. Given 
these country- specifi  c developments, the 
share of debt securities in the euro area as 
a whole increased almost continuously, 
with the exception of the period of the 
strong bank credit boom between 2003 
and 2008.
The shift from bank loans to debt securities 
can impact the transmission of monetary 
policy. The interest rate channel is the focus 
of theories on monetary policy transmis-
sion, with fi  ndings suggesting that a tight-
ening of monetary policy increases interest 
rates on borrowed capital. This, in turn, 
leads to lower demand for credit and 
weaker investment. As a result of fi  nancial 
constraints, the fi  nancial sector can amplify 
this channel. Through the banking channel 
of monetary policy transmission, a tighten-
ing of monetary policy restricts banks’ credit 
supply. This leads, amongst other things, to 
a rise in bank lending rates. If NFCs only 
make limited use of alternative fi  nancing, 
the interest they pay on borrowed capital 
will thus increase disproportionately sharply. 
Against this backdrop, it would be expected

ously for “MFI loans”.

fi  nancing see Deutsche Bundesbank (2012, 2018a).
3 In terms of safeguarding liquidity, trade credits and 
advances are the main alternative to bank loans. Their 
importance has likewise increased in recent years. 
However, as they are less relevant for monetary policy 
transmission, their role is not examined in detail here.Deutsche Bundesbank

that a high share of debt securities in NFC 
fi  nancing weakens monetary policy im-
pulses via this channel. A recent study by a 
Eurosystem working group confi  rms this as-
sumption, showing that conventional mon-
etary policy shocks lead to a smaller decline 
in GDP in euro area countries that have a 
high share of debt securities in NFC fi  nan-
cing than in those with a small share.4 How-
ever, this result only applies to conventional 
monetary policy shocks that are refl  ected in 
changes in short- term interest rates. The ef-
fect is reversed in the case of unconven-
tional monetary policy shocks that affect 
the long end of the yield curve, with mon-
etary policy thereby having a stronger im-
pact in euro area countries with a high 
share of debt securities. One reason for this 
could be the fact that debt securities are 
often held by non- bank fi  nancial intermedi-
aries. These tend to make comparatively 
strong adjustments to their balance sheets 
in response to changes in long- term interest rates. Taken together, a shift in NFC fi  nan-
cing from bank loans to debt securities 
could thus change the relative importance 
of individual monetary policy transmission 
channels. However, this should not funda-
mentally weaken the transmission of mon-
etary policy. The research area briefl  y out-
lined here, which is still largely in its infancy, 
will undoubtedly provide further insights in 
this regard over the next few years.
4 For more in- depth information, see Work stream on 
non- bank fi  nancial intermediation (2021). Its fi  ndings 
on monetary policy transmission are based on the 
work of Holm- Hadulla and Thürwächter (2021). Similar 
results are found at the fi  rm level for the United States 
as well. For more information see Crouzet (2021).Relative importance of bank loans and

information about the orientation of loan sup -
ply policies. BLS banks reported that they had 
repeatedly tightened their credit standards for 
loans to non- financial corporations and house -
holds in the first three quarters of 2022 (latest 
data, see the chart above). They justified the 
stricter standards on the grounds of a per -
ceived heightening of credit risk. For the cor -
porate lending segment, a deterioration in the 
general economic situation and the economic 
outlook, as well as industry- specific and firm-  
specific factors, were cited as the most signifi -
cant reasons. In the case of loans to house -
holds for house purchase, the key issues were 
not only the deterioration in the general eco -
nomic situation but also the decline in borrow -
ers’ creditworthiness. In addition, there was a 
decrease in risk tolerance among the BLS 
banks. The non- standard monetary policy 
measures also gradually expired in 2022 and, 
according to BLS data, therefore no longer had 
an expansionary effect on banks’ financing op -
tions and lending policies.46Given these indications of a significant tighten -
ing of credit standards, the question arises as 
to whether current restrictive effects on lend -
ing caused by loan supply policy exceed the de -
sired degree of monetary policy transmission. 
For a comprehensive assessment, it is necessary 
to incorporate the BLS results into a broader 
context and to evaluate them against the back -
drop of the macroeconomic environment. A 
vector autoregressive model is presented on 
pp.  41ff. that combines data on the growth 
and lending rate of loans to non- financial cor -
porations in the euro area with the correspond -
ing BLS data on changes in credit standards 
and loan demand, conditioning results on GDP 
growth. While the model registered pro -
nounced restrictive loan supply shocks in the 
years of the financial and sovereign debt crises 
as well as in 2021, during the COVID-  19 pan -
demic, there are not yet any signs of an add -
itional restrictive impact through banks for No indications

2022. The analysis therefore shows that the re -
ported adjustments to credit standards have 
not had an overly restrictive effect on lending 
to date. In addition, as shown in the chart on 
p. 29, the model outlined on pp. 25ff. indicates 
that the contributions of the loan supply shocks 
in the recent past have a negative median. 
However, as explained in the box on pp. 25ff., 
this finding is sensitive to specification choices 
and the uncertainty surrounding the estimates 
of these contributions is high. There are there -
fore doubts regarding the reliability of this re -
sult. Overall, model evidence therefore does 
not point to loan supply shocks having a 
greater relevance at present.
Surveys of businesses likewise provide no indi -
cation of any significant financing restrictions 
and thus support the model- based estimate. 
Firms surveyed by SAFE continue to regard ac -
cess to financing as the least of their worries. 
The shortage of skilled labour, in particular, cur -
rently poses the biggest problem for firms. Sur -veys conducted by the European Commission 
also do not indicate any fundamental deterior -
ation in enterprises’ financing conditions to 
date, although there were reports that finan -
cing bottlenecks had become more relevant 
over the course of the year. Firms did not re -
gard them as one of their most pressing con -
cerns, however.
The assessment that supply- side financing con -
straints are not currently a major factor is also 
consistent with the available information on 
the banking sector’s capital resources and prof -
itability in the euro area. The indicators avail -
able for significant banks directly supervised by 
the ECB under the Single Supervisory Mechan -
ism (SSM) suggest that the banking sector was 
well positioned when interest rates began to 
reverse. Although the Common Equity Tier 1 
(CET1) ratio of these banks recently fell slightly, 
it still tended to be somewhat higher in the first 
three quarters of 2022 than it had been in the 
period prior to the start of the pandemic. Earn -So far no

Identifying loan supply and loan demand using the 
Bank Lending Survey
An important task of the monetary and 
fi  nancial analysis is to draw conclusions 
about changes in loan supply and loan de-
mand based on developments in loan 
growth and the lending rate. Monetary pol-
icymakers are particularly interested in 
whether and, if so, to what extent develop-
ments in lending are hindered by supply- 
side constraints. Restrictive loan supply 
shocks could prevent the desired monetary 
policy impulses from being transmitted 
from the key interest rates to the real econ-
omy in the intended way. If this were the 
case, policymakers would have to take this 
factor into account when further tightening 
monetary policy.
However, a multitude of variables have an 
impact on the loan market, which means 
that loan supply and loan demand cannot 
simply be inferred from the statistical data 
on loan growth and the lending rate. This 
box outlines an analytical tool that serves 
this purpose with regard to loans to non- 
fi  nancial corporations in the euro area. To 
this end, the information on lending vol-
umes from the MFI balance sheet statistics 
is supplemented by fi  gures from the MFI 
interest rate statistics on the average rates 
for (newly issued) loans as well as data from 
the Bank Lending Survey (BLS). In the BLS, 
the Eurosystem surveys a sample of 153 
banks domiciled in the euro area about 
credit developments on a quarterly basis. 
The banks’ responses are categorised, 
amongst other things, into information on 
changes in their credit standards on the one 
hand and their assessments of changes in 
loan demand on the other. From an eco-
nomic perspective, however, the responses 
to both of these questions cannot always 
be attributed defi  nitively to either the loan demand side or the loan supply side.1 Fur-
thermore, banks provide their responses to 
the BLS by selecting one of fi  ve multiple- 
choice options2 – as a result, the aggregate 
observations are averages or net shares of a 
qualitative variable. For these reasons, it is 
not possible to quantitatively decompose 
loan growth and the lending rate into 
supply- side and demand- side components 
directly from the survey responses. Instead, 
these can only be obtained in conjunction 
with statistical data.
To this end, a vector autoregressive (VAR) 
model is used to defi  ne equations for loan 
growth, the lending rate, the change in 
credit standards according to the BLS (BLS 
standards), and the change in loan demand 
according to the BLS (BLS demand). Each 
equation incorporates the lagged values of 
its own variable as well as those of each of 
the other variables as a linear combination. 
In addition, the model is conditioned on 
GDP growth, the current and lagged values 
of which are also factored into each equa-
tion. The coeffi   cients of this equation and 
the residuals, i.e. the unexplained remain-
ders, are estimated using standard statis-
tical methods (ordinary least squares 
method) for the period from the fi  rst quar-
1 The questions mainly relate to developments in lend-
ing volumes (in new business). However, a decline in 
lending volumes, for example due to a higher lending 
rate, that the surveyed bank attributes to loan demand 
may have actually been caused by a shift in the loan 
supply curve to which borrowers respond by moving 
along their loan demand curve, which itself remains 
unchanged.
2 For credit standards, the multiple- choice options are 
“tightened considerably”, “tightened somewhat”, “re-
mained basically unchanged”, “eased somewhat”, and 
“eased considerably”. For loan demand, the multiple- 
choice options are “decreased considerably”, “de-
creased somewhat”, “remained basically unchanged”, 
“increased somewhat”, and “increased considerably”.Deutsche Bundesbank

ter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2022. 
The residuals are then decomposed into 
supply and demand effects as well as into 
an unidentifi  ed remainder component. This 
is done by imposing a combination of zero 
and sign restrictions on the model (see the 
table above). These restrictions refl  ect the 
defi  nitions of loan supply and loan demand, 
supplemented by the assumed responses of 
the variables from the BLS: an increase in 
loan supply increases loan growth, lowers the lending rate, and eases BLS standards, 
while BLS demand remains unchanged. An 
increase in loan demand increases loan 
growth, raises the lending rate, and in-
creases BLS demand, while BLS standards 
remain unchanged.3 The remainder shown 
in the adjacent chart therefore consists of 
the components of the residuals that do 
not correspond to this pattern.
Pronounced restrictive loan supply shocks 
were thus mainly recorded during the years 
in which the fi  nancial and sovereign debt 
crises occurred (2010-11 and 2013-14) and 
in 2021, one of the years of the COVID- 19 
pandemic (see the adjacent chart). Owing 
to the government emergency measures, 
2020 was not characterised by restrictions 
to the loan supply. It appears that, to a cer-
tain extent, banks caught up on imposing 
such tightening measures following the un-
certainty regarding the future course of the 
pandemic that was prevalent at the start of 
2021. At the current end, the model indi-
cates surprisingly strong lending. This is at-
tributable, fi  rst, to expansionary develop-
ments in loan demand. Second, despite the 
recent tightening of credit standards, the 
loan supply side is also not having a restrict-
ive effect, but instead a slightly expansion-
ary impact compared with the previous 
year. This is the result of the relatively small 
rise in interest rates compared with the rise 
in loan growth: the identifi  cation mechan-
ism reveals an expansionary loan demand 
shock, as this type of shock increases the 
residual values of both loan growth and the 
lending rate. At the same time, an expan-
sionary loan supply shock is identifi  ed, as 
3 This defi  nition refers to the relative responses of the 
variables to each other and applies conversely if a re-
duction in loan supply or a decline in loan demand are 
assumed. Furthermore, not all of the variables must 
necessarily change; possible zero responses are also 
taken into account in the sign restrictions.Identifying zero and sign restrictions*

ings, as measured by the return on assets, de -
veloped positively in the first three quarters of 
2022. The share of non- performing loans on 
the books of significant banks continued to de -
cline during this period, despite the war in

state of the banking sector reduces the risk of 
additional loan supply- driven constraints, which 
could lead to negative feedback loops between 
the financial sector and the real economy.

When assessing the current monetary policy 
tightening process, the expanded monetary 
and financial analysis also looks at interactions 
between monetary policy and financial stability. 
These are relevant to monetary policy because 
they can have a considerable impact on eco -
nomic activity and inflation. In adverse scen -
arios, there are likely to be negative feedback loops between the financial system and the 
real economy as well as severe disruptions to 
the process of monetary policy transmission. In 
the current environment, the monetary and 
financial analysis gauges the risks to financial 
stability posed by the tighter monetary policy 
stance – which is a necessary response to infla -
tion – and whether this has implications for the 
future path of inflation and thus for forthcom -
ing monetary policy decisions.
Monetary policy tightening has both positive 
and negative effects on financial stability. At 
present, a key question is whether this tighten -
ing may further heighten the risks to financial 
stability caused by the war in Ukraine.
On the one hand, the war in Ukraine and its 
economic repercussions led to a significant rise 
in financial stability risks in the euro area over Monetary policy 
must look at 
interactions 
between monet -
ary policy and 
financial stabilityMonetary policy 
tightening …the rise in the lending rate is small in rela-
tion to the rise in loan growth.
The tightening measures reported in the 
BLS have therefore not had an impact on 
lending in the form of loan supply restric-
tions. In principle, the BLS data on changes 
in credit standards have a certain lead over 
lending,4 so lending would be expected to 
decline over the coming quarters. However, 
the model described here shows that, as 
things currently stand, the tightening is un-
likely to go beyond the usual (and, from a 
monetary policy perspective, desirable) sys-
tematic correlation.

the course of 2022.47 This is because the bur -
dens associated with the war increase the risk 
that the vulnerabilities built up in previous years 
– such as growing debt in the government sec -
tor and in parts of the corporate sector in some 
countries as well as the sharp rise in real estate 
prices – could trigger disorderly adjustments in 
an adverse scenario. Given the changed envir -
onment, credit risk increased for firms and 
households over the course of 2022, while pro -
grammes to mitigate the impact of rising en -
ergy prices reduced the fiscal leeway of euro 
area countries. The associated risks could be 
amplified by a further tightening of the monet -
ary policy stance, as tightening leads to more 
stringent financing conditions and falling prices 
on the financial markets. Both of these factors 
could reduce asset quality and increase the al -
ready elevated market stress caused by the war 
in Ukraine, making adverse feedback loops be -
tween the financial system and the real econ -
omy more likely. In addition, increasing interest 
rates and rising costs of living are dampening 
demand for residential property, meaning that, 
in adverse scenarios, it would be conceivable to 
see falling residential real estate prices, lower 
collateral values for housing loans and higher 
future credit defaults.
On the other hand, a monetary policy oriented 
towards price stability lowers the risks to the 
financial system posed by high inflation rates 
and an associated weakening of economic 
growth. In addition, raising the policy rate, es -
pecially when starting from a low interest rate 
level, has a positive impact on banks’ net inter -
est income over the longer term.48 Further -
more, the tighter monetary policy stance will 
reduce the build- up of existing financial vulner -
abilities in the medium term. For example, it is 
likely to dampen excessive risk- taking and the 
search for yield seen on the financial markets in 
the low interest rate environment of recent 
years. At the same time, it should reduce the 
incentives for governments and non- financial 
corporations to accumulate more debt.In this environment, the monetary and financial 
analysis is tasked with observing the relation -
ships between monetary policy and financial 
stability and determining their implications for 
monetary policy. Internal analyses indicate that, 
in its current state, the financial system will be 
able to cope with the effects of the changed 
monetary policy stance and absorb the impact 
of the planned further tightening. The changed 
macroeconomic environment and the repricing 
in the financial markets have, in and of them -
selves, increased the risk of financial amplifica -
tion effects. However, as outlined in the discus -
sion of banks’ loan supply, the euro area bank -
ing system is currently in a good state, which 
should limit negative feedback loops between 
the financial system and the real economy.49 In 
addition, the supervisory authorities of a num -
ber of euro area countries have activated 
macroprudential capital buffers in recent years. 
If necessary, banks can use these buffers to sta -
bilise their loan supply.
At the same time, however, monetary policy 
must ensure that it does not itself become the 
cause of disorderly financial market adjust -
ments. It is therefore important for the Govern -
ing Council of the ECB to act in a forward-  
looking manner and communicate its monetary 
policy clearly and convincingly. The Transmis -
sion Protection Instrument (TPI) is also available 
as a means of countering any unwarranted and 
disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious 
threat to the transmission of monetary policy 
across the euro area. This in itself should al -
ready have a stabilising effect.

fact that the changing environment has repeat -
edly presented monetary policy with new chal -
lenges. Second, access to additional data 
sources and advances in methodologies have 
made it possible to investigate an ever broader 
range of issues. Through these adjustments, 
the Eurosystem’s monetary and financial analy -
sis has time and again succeeded in making 
important  contributions to the preparation of 
monetary policy decisions.
The prominent focus on monetary develop -
ments at the start of the European monetary 
union was a legacy of the Bundesbank’s culture 
of stability. However, the empirical evidence of 
a stable money- price relationship that can be 
utilised for monetary policy purposes became 
increasingly weak in the 2000s. Against this 
background, and in light of the challenges 
posed by the global financial crisis, the focus of 
the monetary and financial analysis has pro -
gressively shifted towards monetary policy 
transmission. Work in this analytical area in 
particular was extensively used to prepare deci -
sions taken during the low interest rate period 
on the use and design of the new non- standard 
monetary policy measures. In addition, it has 
become clear that the monetary and financial 
analysis can play a valuable role in identifying 
financial shocks and their impact on the real 
economy. This topic, too, gained greatly in im -
portance in the wake of the financial and sov -
ereign debt crisis.
The COVID-  19 pandemic, the energy crisis and 
high inflation have caused another shift in the 
issues to be addressed by the monetary and 
financial analysis. One question that has arisen 
is how the large growth in the monetary aggre -
gate M3 in 2020 might be related to the rise in 
inflation in 2021-22. Our analyses suggest that 
the strong money growth seen in the first 
phase was primarily due to money demand 
shocks associated with the uncertainty- led in -
crease in money holdings, but that these shocks 
did not cause a rise in inflation. Subsequently, 
money growth and inflation were positively af -
fected by aggregate demand shocks, which are probably attributable to fiscal support meas -
ures taken during the COVID-  19 pandemic, and 
by accommodative monetary policy.
The impact of the war in Ukraine on the infla -
tion outlook and the change in the monetary 
policy stance raise further questions. With re -
gard to transmission, the monetary and finan -
cial analysis indicates that monetary policy 
tightening has so far been having its intended 
effect on the financing conditions of banks, 
firms and households, with financing costs hav -
ing risen on a broad front. Net issuance of cor -
porate bonds has declined significantly since 
the beginning of the year, even turning nega -
tive at times. Net lending to non- financial cor -
porations and households has also weakened 
recently. Various model calculations suggest 
that the observed adjustments of financing 
conditions are consistent with the macroeco -
nomic environment and historical patterns. 
Moreover, they do not show any indication 
that the loan supply side is currently generating 
any additional negative stimuli. It can thus be 
assumed that the transmission process is intact 
and that the tighter monetary policy stance is 
being transmitted to the real economy as in -
tended.
Since the 2021 strategy review, the monetary 
and financial analysis has also explicitly looked 
at financial stability aspects. Viewed in isol -
ation, a further tightening of the monetary pol -
icy stance may heighten financial stability risks, 
which have already been elevated by the war in 
Ukraine and its economic consequences. At the 
same time, however, a monetary policy ori -
ented towards price stability reduces the risks 
posed to the financial system by high inflation 
rates and existing financial vulnerabilities. At 
the current end, the monetary and financial an -
alysis suggests that the euro area banking sys -
tem is in a good state and is able to absorb the 
impact of monetary policy tightening. This, 
too, bears out the current monetary policy 
stance. Major negative feedback loops be -
tween the financial system and the real econ -
omy are not expected at present.Increasingly

Term structures in economic analysis
The path of interest rates of different maturities provides a wide range of information on how 
monetary policy, business cycle developments and the inflation outlook interact. When analysing 
interest rate developments, central banks pay particular attention to the impact of monetary pol -
icy measures on different maturity segments of the yield curve. Using term structure models, it is 
possible to look at the determinants of interest rates in detail. In particular, the models allow us 
to identify different interest rate components that cannot be observed directly. These include, 
above all, “pure” interest rate expectations and different risk premia.
In principle, a yield curve can be derived from various instruments of interest- bearing securities. 
For monetary policymakers, the €STR yield curve is of interest in the first instance, as the euro 
short- term rate (€STR) is closely linked to the policy rates. The yield curve of Federal securities also 
provides important information on bond- specific aspects, such as safety, scarcity and liquidity, 
which are likewise important for the transmission of monetary policy.
In the current setting, the path of the €STR yield curve indicates further rising policy rates until 
autumn 2023. However, the curve currently overstates “pure” expectations about the further hike 
in policy rates. This is because the continued high degree of uncertainty about how inflation will 
develop entails interest rate risk for market participants. To compensate for this, they demand risk 
premia in the form of higher term premia. Long- term interest rates have also risen significantly 
since the beginning of 2022. In this case, too, longer- term term premia increased alongside 
“pure” interest rate expectations.
Higher inflation expectations and inflation risk premia were the initial economic drivers of the 
increase in longer- term yields since the start of 2022. Investors demand the latter to compensate 
for unexpectedly high future inflation. Owing to the inflation dynamics, the Eurosystem subse -
quently introduced monetary policy tightening measures. This also led to significantly rising 
(inflation- adjusted) real interest rates in the second half of 2022. In addition, the yield- lowering 
effect of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy purchase programmes on term premia gradually 
declined. This was initially driven by the end of net purchases and later by the ECB Governing 
Council’s anticipated announcement that the full reinvestment of asset holdings would come to 
an end.
Term premia have risen lately, but are still at a historically low level. Experience gained over the 
past few decades with supply shocks such as those in the 1970s has shown that, after a pro -
longed period of strong inflationary pressures, term premia have remained at an elevated level. 
This was due to a high degree of perceived inflation uncertainty. Even after inflation was success -
fully tamed in the 1980s, this uncertainty initially persisted. In terms of the current setting, com -
bating inflation in the Eurosystem is the highest priority in order to prevent any doubts arising as 
to monetary policy’s pursuit of stability.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The yield curve describes the relationship be -
tween the maturity of bonds and their interest 
rates. For central banks, studying interest rate 
movements along the yield curve provides valu -
able insights for monetary policy analysis. To 
put it simply, monetary policymakers change 
the monetary policy stance by adjusting policy 
rates or – as introduced in the low interest rate 
environment – by purchasing assets. They thus 
influence the interest rates of different matur -
ities, which help shape the macroeconomic en -
vironment and inflation developments through 
changed general financing conditions. This typ -
ically gives rise to a close relationship between 
the use of monetary policy instruments and 
general financing conditions. Movements in 
the yield curve therefore give monetary policy -
makers information about the transmission of 
monetary policy measures. At the same time, 
they provide valuable indications of market 
participants’ expectations and risks relating to 
the macroeconomic situation and the inflation 
outlook. This is why the Bundesbank has trad -
itionally paid great attention to developments 
in the yield curve.1
Identifying the drivers of interest rate move -
ments can give us a greater understanding of 
them. Term structure models decompose inter -
est rate movements into expected short- term 
interest rates that cannot be directly observed 
– “pure” interest rate expectations – and into 
risk premia that cannot be directly observed. 
Conceptually, pure interest rate expectations 
can be determined using the historical dynam -
ics of interest rates, supplemented, where ap -
plicable, by macroeconomic data or surveys 
that are not affected by risk aspects. The term 
premium is then the difference between the 
observed interest rates and the interest rate ex -
pectations derived from the model. This de -
composition can be used as a basis for analys -
ing the impact of policy rate changes and non- 
standard monetary policy measures, amongst 
other things. The main issue to be explored is 
the extent to which the observed interest rates reflect “pure” interest rate expectations of mar -
ket participants and what portion of the inter -
est rates constitutes compensation for the as -
sumption of various risks (see the upper chart 
on p. 55).
Depending on the type of asset, risk- averse 
market participants require risk premia for dif -
ferent types of risk. These include, in particular, 
the risk of an unexpected change in future 
interest rates (interest rate risk) and the risk of 
default on a payment or loan (credit risk). In 
addition, market participants wish to be com -
pensated for the risk that, in an environment of 
shrinking market liquidity, securities can only be 
sold off quickly at a discount (liquidity risk). Fi -
nally, investors may be willing to accept a lower 
yield (i.e. higher price) if, for example, they are 
seeking a specific asset for regulatory reasons 
that is, however, difficult to obtain (scarcity 
premium). Generally speaking, investors de -
mand a positive risk premium for investments 
with high payouts when the economy is faring 
well and low payouts when it is doing badly. 
Securities with high payouts in bad times have 
an insurance element. Investors are willing to 
pay a premium for such assets or to forego a 
yield. As with insurance, the risk premium is 
negative in this case.
The first section of this article discusses how the 
yield curve of overnight index swaps (OISs) of 
different maturities can be decomposed into the 
components mentioned above. OIS rates are 
based on swap agreements in which two parties 
swap an agreed fixed interest rate against a ser -
ies of overnight floating interest rates over a set 
term. The overnight floating rate is pegged to 
the movement of the €STR.2 OIS rates for short 
and medium- term maturities are therefore Yield curve con -

1 The first Bundesbank Monthly Report with an article on 
yield curves was published in 1971; see Deutsche Bundes -
bank (1971). More recently, the specificities of estimating 
yield curves during the financial crisis were discussed in 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2013) and the zero lower bound on 
interest rates in Deutsche Bundesbank (2017a).
2 The €STR is an overnight interest rate calculated by the 
ECB on the basis of individual transactions between banks 
and financial counterparties. Before the €STR was intro -
duced, OIS agreements were based on the EONIA.Deutsche Bundesbank

closely tied to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
toolkit (see the lower chart on this page). The 
OIS rates provide information on the priced- in 
“pure” expectations of future monetary policy 
measures and the associated interest rate uncer -
tainty as assessed by market participants.
The second section of this article focuses on 
yields of Federal securities. Owing to their ex -
cellent credit quality, Federal securities are con -
sidered to be default- free and provide the 
benchmark in the euro area for euro-  
denominated debt securities overall. For ex -
ample, they form the basis against which cor -
porate bonds or government debt instruments 
issued by other jurisdictions are priced.3 Federal 
securities yields follow a similar path to OIS 
rates of matching maturity. However, they are 
also subject to bond market- specific influences, 
which result in an interest rate spread between 
the OIS rate and the Federal bond (Bund) yield 
(see the adjacent chart). The analysis focuses 
on additional premia for particular safety, high 
scarcity and high liquidity. These have become 
more important in recent years with the use of 
non- standard monetary policy measures.
Finally, the third section of this article deals with 
the relationship between interest rates, inflation 
and the real economy. By analysing inflation- 
related and real components of the yield curve, 
we can gain a deeper understanding of the im -
pact of inflation expectations, the growth out -
look and the associated uncertainties on the 
yield curve. This section also addresses the 
questions of how well a recession can be pre -
dicted on the basis of yield curves and how 
monetary policy should respond to the current 
high price increases given the experience gained 
from earlier periods of high inflation.
Policy rate expectations and 
interest rate risk
By varying their policy rates, monetary policy -
makers influence the slope, curvature and level 
of the yield curve. Based on an OIS term struc -ture model, the upper chart on the next page 
shows the decomposition of the two- year OIS 
rate into the average expected €STR path (ex -
pectation component) and the term premium

model is the explicit inclusion of a binding lower bound. 
The specification of the lower bound takes into account 
both current and expected future changes in the effective 
lower bound. This means that the model is capable of 
mapping how policy rates have gradually moved into nega -
tive territory. As regards model estimation, the approach 
also considers short and long- term interest rate surveys to 
ensure that expectations derived from the yield curve 
about the future path of short rates are as consistent as 
possible with the survey results.Deutsche Bundesbank

maturity segment is driven by the expectation 
component.
The degree of monetary policy accommodation 
hinges not only on the actual level of the policy 
rate but also on the expected future path of 
policy rates. This is because policy rate expect -
ations have a major impact on general finan -
cing conditions. Through its monetary policy 
communication, the central bank can seek to 
influence the expectations market participants 
have about the future development of policy 
rates.The central bank can indirectly influence policy 
rate expectations by communicating its assess -
ment of the economic and inflation outlook. 
This gives market participants the opportunity 
to readjust their expectations about the per -
ceived future path of policy rates accordingly.5
The central bank can also directly influence 
market participants’ policy rate expectations, 
however. It does so by explicitly describing the 
path it intends policy rates to take. In doing 
this, it also aims to reduce uncertainty about 
the medium and longer- term path of interest 
rates and thereby to lower term premia. One 
such form of explicit communication about fu -
ture policy rates, known as forward guidance, 
started to become more prominent in the Euro -
system from July 2013. At that time, the scope 
for policy rate cuts was increasingly limited by 
the perceived lower bound. The result of this 
communication, targeting interest rate expect -
ations and the term premium, was that OIS 
rates with medium- term maturities continu -
ously converged with the deposit facility rate 
(see the upper chart on this page). The forward 
guidance increased the downward pressure on 
medium- term interest rates because the Gov -
erning Council of the ECB explicitly communi -
cated that policy rates could fall further below 
the previously perceived lower bound (“easing 
bias”). It thus signalled even greater downside 
risks for the future path of interest rates, which 
was reflected in temporarily negative term pre -
mia in these maturity segments.
This pattern underwent a significant change at 
the beginning of last year. Since then, inflation 
in the euro area has accelerated further amidst 
Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The Governing 
Council of the ECB subsequently adjusted its 
forward guidance by first removing the easing 
bias in March 2022 and, since July 2022, em -
phasising that future policy rate developments 
will be data- dependent. From July to Decem -Communication

ber, the Governing Council decided on several 
large interest rate hikes totalling 250 basis 
points. As at the end of December 2022, mar -
ket participants consider a maximum €STR of 
3.0% to be the most likely level (see the lower 
chart on p. 56). Market participants therefore 
expect further interest rate changes in view of 
the persistently high inflationary pressures. The 
expected €STR is up to 50 basis points lower 
than the observed €STR forward rates. This 
positive term premium suggests that market 
participants mainly see a risk of interest rate 
hikes in the context of high inflation uncer -
tainty.
The relative importance of the term premium 
on the OIS rate increases as the maturity 
lengthens. The longer the capital of a fixed-  
income security is tied up, the greater the ef -
fect of interest rate changes on the value of the 
swap (duration). Higher uncertainty about the 
path of interest rates is thus “automatically” 
translated into higher premia as the maturity 
increases. At present, the term premium for the 
ten- year OIS rate is 75 basis points, compared 
with 40 basis points for the two- year OIS rate.
Of particular importance to monetary policy is 
the fact that the estimated term premium has 
declined significantly since 2014 and was in 
negative territory until the start of 2022. This 
was largely due to forward guidance as well as 
the Eurosystem’s broad- based purchase pro -
grammes. These include the asset purchase 
programme (APP) announced in January 2015 
and, from March 2020, the pandemic emer -
gency purchase programme (PEPP). Both were 
subsequently increased and expanded.6 The 
programmes primarily took effect through a 
mechanism referred to in the literature as dur -
ation extraction. The Eurosystem added dur -
ation risk to central bank balance sheets by 
purchasing debt securities held by other invest -
ors using central bank money that is not ex -
posed to interest rate risk. This reduced the ag -
gregate duration risk to which non- Eurosystem 
balance sheets were exposed. Investors were thus prepared to accept a lower yield by way of 
lower to negative term premia.7
With regard to monetary policy transmission, it 
is important to be able to gauge the functional 
relationship between purchase programmes, 
duration extraction and the level of the term 
premium. To do so, an expanded OIS term 
structure model can be used which explicitly 
takes into account the aggregate duration risk 
of non- Eurosystem investors and quantifies the 
effect on the term premium.8
The upper chart on p. 58 shows the effect of 
the APP and PEPP on the OIS term premium. 
The estimations indicate that the ten- year OIS 
rate was around 100 basis points lower by the 
end of 2020 than in the counterfactual scen -
ario in which the Eurosystem had not bought 
bonds. The end of net purchases under the 
PEPP (March 2022) and the APP (July 2022) and

risk in the market rise again. In line with this, 
the yield- lowering effect of the purchase pro -
grammes decreased in 2022. In order to ensure 
consistency with the monetary policy stance, 
the Governing Council of the ECB decided at its 
December 2022 meeting to reduce monetary 
policy asset holdings at a measured and pre -
dictable pace from March 2023 onwards. The 
portfolios will be reduced by €15 billion per 
month on average until the end of the second 
quarter of 2023, in order to reduce the yield-  
lowering effects on the term premium. The 
subsequent pace of the decline will be deter -
mined over time. According to the estimations, 
however, the decrease in term premia induced 
by the asset purchases persists for years – in 
fact, for as long as the Eurosystem’s balance 
sheet contains duration risk.
The special role of Bunds: 
benchmark status and 
scarcity 
Yields on Federal securities have been lower 
than OIS rates for some years now. For ex -
ample, the two- year OIS rate was close to the 
deposit facility rate between 2017 and 2021 
given the effect of the forward guidance de -
scribed above. OIS rates are largely constrained 
downwards by the Eurosystem’s deposit facility 
rate and the perceived lower bound. Two- year 
Federal securities yields, however, were signifi -
cantly lower than the deposit facility rate for a 
time. During the purchase programmes, Bund 
yields fell more sharply than OIS rates of the 
same maturity (see the adjacent lower chart). 
However, this cannot be due to credit quality, as 
both instruments are considered virtually default-  
free by market participants. The special role of 
Federal securities is also shown by the fact that, 
in the secured short- term money market, inter -
est rate reductions are granted if German Fed -
eral securities are provided as collateral.9 This Yields on

interest rate reduction is referred to as repo 
specialness and was at an all- time high in the 
autumn of 2022.10
There are many reasons for the size of the two 
interest rate spreads mentioned above. Federal 
securities are the benchmark in the euro area. 
The Federal securities market is a reference 
market for numerous euro- denominated finan -
cial products. For example, the prices of Federal 
securities are the benchmark for all govern -
ment bond prices in the euro area as a whole.
Owing to the combination of good credit qual -
ity and high issue volumes, Federal securities 
are very liquid across all the typical dimensions, 
such as “breadth” (trading costs at a given vol -
ume), “depth” (tradable volume at a given 
price) and “resilience” (the half- life of random 
price fluctuations). The high level of liquidity 
can also be seen, for example, in the fact that 
the bond futures with the highest turnover in 
the euro area are based on Federal securities.
Federal securities are a good default- free way 
to put away liquid funds even in times of crisis 
– unlike swaps. Liquidity and scarcity premia 
therefore rise in times of crisis (safe haven ef -
fects). Market participants are willing to pay a 
higher price (convenience premium) for the ad -
vantage of access to a Bund which is scarce in 
such market situations as well. This can be 
readily seen in the OIS rate- Bund yield spread 
at the start of the COVID-  19 crisis, for ex -
ample.11
Institutional investors also hold Federal secur -
ities for reasons relating to monetary policy and 
regulation. This primarily concerns banks (Basel 
rules, collateral for derivatives), insurers (solv -
ency rules) and central banks (exchange rate 
management, reserve maintenance, monetary 
policy objectives).12 This is the reason for what 
is known as a scarcity premium. This premium 
cannot be explained by traditional interest rate 
risk or counterparty credit risk. The monetary 
policy purchase programmes increase this scar -city premium, as they reduce the freely tradable 
Federal securities in free float.13
The special factors listed here, which have 
time- varying effects of different magnitudes on 
Bund prices, impair the quality of the economic 
indicators derived from them. This should be 
taken into account when making statements 
on expected policy rate changes, inflation ex -
pectations and the economic outlook, which 
will be discussed in the next section.
The yield curve: statements 
about the economy and 
inflation 
Economic developments and inflation dynam -
ics are fundamental drivers of the yield curve. 
First, monetary policy responds to a changed 
inflation outlook, which is reflected in the path 
of interest rates. Second, the yield curve re -
flects market participants’ expectations about 
future inflation and economic developments. 
The following section examines the impact of 
inflation expectations and the growth outlook 
on the yield curve.

sessment of economic developments. For 
inflation- linked bonds, the coupon and princi -
pal increase with the inflation rate, meaning 
that a real yield can be calculated. Like yields 
on nominal bonds, real yields on inflation-  
linked bonds can also be decomposed into a 
“pure” expectation component and a term pre -
mium.
Based on the difference between nominal and 
real yield curves, it is possible to draw conclu -
sions about the implicit inflation compensation 
in bond markets at different maturities. For ex -
ample, implicitly expected inflation can be cal -
culated as the difference between nominal and 
real short- term interest rate expectations (see 
the chart above). These data thus give the 
Euro system useful, real- time information about 
market participants’ inflation outlook. The dif -
ference between the nominal term premium 
and the real term premium also yields the infla -
tion risk premium. Inflation- linked bonds in fact 
not only protect investors against expected in -
flation. This type of bond also safeguards the 
purchasing power of the invested euros against 
an unexpected increase in inflation. In most 
cases, risk- averse investors are willing to pay a 
positive inflation risk premium for this add -
itional security. In recent years, however, the in -
flation risk premium has also been negative at 
times. At that time, investors also included de -flationary scenarios in their calculations given 
very low inflation expectations.
When it comes to monetary policy analysis, it is 
important to take account of the inflation risk 
premium. First, as stated above, the calculated 
bond- based compensation for inflation only cor -
responds to “pure” inflation expectations if it is 
adjusted for the inflation risk premium. Second, it 
affects monetary policy transmission from short-  
term to long- term yields. This is because changes 
in inflation risk premia in long- term yields can, for 
example, strengthen or weaken the monetary 
policy steering intended via the policy rate. Given 
a low and relatively stable inflation risk premium, 
monetary policy impulses can also be transmitted 
more directly to financing conditions. At the 
same time, a low inflation risk premium reflects 
market participants’ high confidence in the de -
termination and ability of monetary policymakers 
to achieve the inflation target.
The real rate of interest on financial assets is 
closely tied to expected real economic develop -
ments. In particular, it is based on the return on 
investments along the path of economic devel -
opment and is influenced in the longer term by 
potential output growth.14 One result of this is 
that deteriorating real interest rate expect -
ations could be seen as an indication that mar -
ket participants are revising their real growth 
expectations downwards.
From a conceptual point of view, real term pre -
mia can be positive or negative. In other words, 
investors can either demand a higher yield on a 
long- term investment or be willing to accept a 
lower yield by way of these premia. For risk-  
averse investors, the option of being able to hedge 
their consumption even in bad times is crucial.15Market- based

14 This view closely corresponds to the question as to the 
fundamental drivers of real interest rate developments. The 
equilibrium real interest rate can be described as the real 
short- term interest rate that closes the gap between real -
ised growth and growth potential and stabilises the infla -
tion rate. For more information, see Brand et al. (2018), 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2001) or Bliss (1999).

If, say, the yield on real bonds were to decrease 
in an environment of weakening growth ex -
pectations, real long- term bonds would pro -
vide a hedging opportunity for investors’ de -
sired consumption level. This is because a de -
clining yield means that the value of the bond 
increases and that a real gain is achieved in the 
event of a sale. Investors are then willing to ac -
cept a lower yield. This is reflected in a negative 
real term premium. The bond will then have an 
insurance element. This is usually the case 
when growth expectations weaken, inflation 
falls and monetary policymakers subsequently 
loosen the monetary policy stance.
If, conversely, in an imminent recessionary 
phase, real bond yields rise and the market val -
ues of real bonds fall, investors typically de -
mand compensation. This is then a positive real 
term premium. This could happen if the eco -
nomic outlook deteriorates whilst inflation ex -
pectations rise. In such an environment, pos -
sibly driven by supply shocks, monetary policy -
makers tighten the monetary policy stance in 
order to stabilise inflation expectations, despite 
the looming economic downturn. The bond 
does not have an insurance element in this situ -
ation.
Studies have shown that real term premia tend 
to be countercyclical and increase during reces -
sions.16 Empirical and more heavily model-  
based studies also reveal the factors that have 
played an important role in the historical evolu -
tion of real term premia and inflation risk pre -
mia.17 Market participants demand a higher in -
flation risk premium if the inflation outlook ap -
pears uncertain. The inflation risk premium is 
also higher if (nominal) short- term interest rates 
are more volatile. This could be the case, for 
example, if the monetary policy stance changes 
rapidly and market participants are uncertain 
about the intended monetary policy stance. A 
countercyclical relationship can be discerned in 
relation to economic activity: higher unemploy -
ment or low consumer confidence are usually 
associated with high inflation risk premia. In 
the past, periods of recession have often been associated with high inflation. This is another 
reason why, in such times, investors have de -
manded greater compensation for assuming 
inflation risk. Monetary policy also influences 
the size of the inflation risk premium. Focusing 
heavily on the price stability objective, monet -
ary policy is able to contribute to lower infla -
tion risk premia, especially in the medium term. 
The sooner monetary policymakers are able to 
credibly commit to the inflation target, the 
greater the impact on inflation risk premia.18 
One major way in which this can be achieved is 
if monetary policymakers provide credible, 
forward- looking communication on the inter -
est rate path they intend to take to ensure that 
the inflation target is met.

Decomposition of nominal yields into real and 
infl  ation- related components using short time series
Together with the yields on infl  ation- linked 
Federal securities, the yields on nominal 
Federal securities can be broken down into 
real and infl  ation- related sub- components 
in the model. This type of combined estima-
tion then allows all components of nominal 
yields to be calculated as shown in the 
chart on p. 64. A detailed decomposition of 
this kind provides deeper insights into nom-
inal interest rate developments.
The Bundesbank has calculated yield curve 
parameters for inflation- linked Federal 
securities since 2011 – prior to this, insuffi   -
cient data points were available along the 
maturity spectrum to ensure stable esti-
mates.1 This period is relatively short, which 
may pose a problem as the estimation par-
ameters of the yield curve can be biased 
when using fairly short time series. The bias 
is signalled by the fact that the estimation 
results for the long- term expectation com-
ponent are excessively stable, whereas the 
term premia component is excessively vola-
tile. Therefore, a model approach that takes 
into account the challenge of a short data 
history works well for analysing the yield 
curve of infl  ation- linked Federal securities.
The sub- components in the chart on p. 64 
are estimated in two steps.2 The fi  rst step is 
to estimate a term structure model using 
data on the nominal interest rate structure 
for Germany starting from 1999.3 This pro-
duces nominal expectations about the fu-
ture short- term interest rate and term pre-
mia. Based on this estimation, a restriction 
is imposed on the real estimation. To this 
end, the variance of changes in the nominal 
expectation component from 2011 to the 
present day is calculated. The second step 
consists of estimating the model for real yields whilst imposing a restriction. The re-
striction is that the variance of changes in 
the real expectation component matches 
the variance of changes in the nominal ex-
pectation component from the fi  rst step. 
The estimation is thus based on the hypoth-
esis that the statistical properties of real and 
nominal short- term interest rate expect-
ations are similar. For the expectation com-
ponent of long- term bond yields, this re-
quires anchored long- term infl  ation expect-
ations. This estimation results in a relatively 
stable decomposition of real yields into real 
term premia and the real expectation com-
ponent. Infl  ation expectations and the infl  a-
tion risk premium are derived from the dif-
ference between the nominal and real 
equivalents.
In this approach, the scope for interpret-
ation is limited in two regards. First, the real 
and the nominal term structure models are 
estimated separately. Other models esti-
mate the nominal and real term structures 
together in a joint model approach.4 Unlike 
modelling performed in a joint model, the 
separate estimation does not allow for any 
statements about the statistical relation-
1 The Federal Government issued the fi  rst infl  ation- 
linked bond in 2006. It had an original maturity of ten 
years. Further bonds and other residual maturities fol-
lowed later.
2 For a more detailed discussion of the restriction con-
cept and how it relates to the literature, see Halber-
stadt (2021). The discussion paper restricts the variance 
of changes in average expected future short rates, 
whereas the analysis presented here restricts the vari-
ance of changes in average short- term interest rate ex-
pectations over ten years. The alternative calibration 
used in the discussion paper aims at binding the 
model- implied variance of short- term interest rate ex-
pectations to that of short rate expectations from sur-
veys.

Federal securities play a major role and make it 
more difficult to interpret changes in interest 
rates.19 Specifically, inflation- linked bonds have 
lower market liquidity than their nominal 
equivalents, which is reflected in considerably 
wider trading ranges than those for nominal 
bonds (see the chart on p. 61). However, separ -
ately identifying liquidity premia in a model 
with nominal and real yields is a highly impre -
cise exercise.20
In addition, the scarcity premia mentioned 
above also play a role in determining market-  
based inflation compensation – the difference 
between nominal and real bonds. The scarcity 
premia on nominal bonds are higher than those 
of real bonds. Inflation compensation therefore 
tends to be underestimated, currently by around 
20 basis points (see the chart on p. 61).21 This is 
another aspect that makes economic interpret -
ation more difficult. This is especially true in 
times of crisis, when fluctuations in the scarcity 
premium are particularly pronounced.The large number of influencing and disruptive 
factors suggests that there may be methods 
with different focal points for modelling and 
quantifying yield curve components. The box 
on pp. 62 f. outlines a specific method for de -
composing nominal yield movements into their 
real components and the impact of inflation 
since the outbreak of the coronavirus pan -
demic in the chart on p. 64. This method allows 
for, above all, the challenge posed by the short 
historical availability of inflation- linked German 
bonds. It should be noted, though, that liquid -
ity and scarcity premia were not taken into ac -
count. The decomposition of the ten- year Bund 
yield calculated in this manner illustrates the 
change in the significance of inflation- related Scarcity pre -

parameters. Moreover, comparing the stat-
istical properties of separate model estima-
tions for real and nominal yields with those 
of an estimation in a closed model approach 
shows that a joint estimation of both yield 
curves allows a smaller model framework 
with fewer factors and parameters to be 
used with no signifi  cant deterioration in 
estimation quality.5
Second, the impact of liquidity differences 
in the real and nominal bond markets can-
not be estimated in the analysis presented 
here. However, models that do take these 
liquidity differences into account are only 
able to determine the associated premia 
with high levels of imprecision (see margin 
heading “Liquidity premia” beginning on 
p. 61).

components over the past few years.22 While 
they were still lowering yields at the start of the 
coronavirus pandemic, the inflation risk pre -
mium was already contributing to higher yields 
over the course of 2021. This indicates that 
market participants already saw unexpectedly 
high inflation developments as a possibility at 
this stage. They demanded higher risk compen -
sation for this increased uncertainty. From the 
second half of 2021 onwards, the increase in 
yields then also increasingly reflected higher in -
flation expectations. The monetary policy tight -
ening measures subsequently introduced by 
the Eurosystem also contributed to higher real 
yields last year. In particular, investors increas -
ingly demanded a higher real term premium for 
investing in long- term inflation- linked bonds. In 
view of the massive supply shocks, this may 
have reflected greater uncertainty about eco -
nomic developments and a diminishing risk ap -
petite in the context of rising policy rates. This 
development is therefore consistent with the 
above- mentioned findings of a stronger coun -tercyclical development of the real term pre -
mium. Based on the model estimates, the real 
short- term interest rate expectations in the 
summer of 2022 reflected a gloomy economic 
outlook. For example, the contribution of real 
short- term interest rate expectations was lower 
in July and August 2022, when gas prices in 
spot markets peaked.
Yield curve components by 
historical  standards
What can be learned from the historical evolu -
tion of yield curve components and applied to 
the current situation, in which the economic 
outlook is deteriorating and high inflation rates 
are being observed? The following section fo -
cuses on two aspects. It looks, first, at how 
well a recession can be predicted on the basis 
of yield curves and, second, how monetary pol -
icy should respond to the current high inflation 
rate. To this end, the nominal yield on ten- year 
Bunds is decomposed on the basis of a term 
structure model into a nominal expectation 
component and a nominal term premium, 
starting from 1967 (see the chart on p. 69).23 A 
further breakdown into real components, as in 
the previous section, is not possible for this 
long period, as inflation- linked bonds are a 
fairly new financial instrument.

22 The chart illustrates the components’ contributions to 
the change in nominal yield. The model employed here 
using bond data provides trading- day results. Owing to the 
specified influencing and disruptive factors, the level of 
inflation- related yield components can be determined 
more reliably on the basis of survey- based long- term infla -
tion expectations.
23 The decomposition of interest rate developments fol -
lows the approach of Speck (2023). This makes it possible 
to estimate a term structure model with simple linear re -
gressions, even if there is no observable short- term interest 
rate of one- month maturity as for Federal securities. As an 
extension of existing linear regression approaches such as 
Adrian et al. (2013), the approach avoids a numerical opti -
misation as in Joslin et al. (2010). The estimated model is a 
classic, exponential- affine term structure model with a 
homogeneous error variance term excluding macroeco -
nomic variables.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current drivers of market- based probabilities of recession 
based on the yield curve
The shape of the yield curve is a closely 
watched economic indicator of short- term 
economic growth among fi  nancial market 
participants, with particular attention being 
paid to a fl  at, or even falling, yield curve. A 
rule of thumb of sorts has been established 
in fi  nancial markets: long- term rates falling 
below short- term rates, known as inversion, 
can be interpreted as a recessionary signal.
Persistent global price pressures and the ac-
companying decline in private consumption 
and investment have been casting a shadow 
over the economic outlook since late 2021. 
In Europe, high energy prices and the un-
certainty they have brought about are also 
dimming economic prospects. In this con-
text, a fl  attening of the yield curve observed 
since the summer of 2022 –  not only in 
Germany but also in other countries inside 
and outside the euro area – raises the ques-
tion as to whether this is currently indicative 
of a looming recession.
On a long- term historical average, the yield 
curve is sloping upwards. A fl  attening yield 
curve may refl  ect reduced compensation 
for interest rate risk, but also decreased 
short- term interest rate expectations.
There can be various reasons for the statis-
tical relationship between the yield curve in-
verting and a recession occurring. Amongst 
other things, the prospect of rising infl  ation 
may prompt the central bank to raise its 
policy rates. If, for example, this causes 
market participants to expect lower infl  a-
tionary pressures in the medium to long 
term and an economic slowdown, yields at 
the short end of the yield curve will see 
stronger growth than at the long end. 
However, a fl  attening of the curve may also be the result of market participants antici-
pating a more accommodative monetary 
policy in the future if, looking ahead, they 
believe that the central bank could lower 
policy rates in response to an economic 
slowdown.1
Historically, this relationship between a fl  at-
tening of the yield curve and an increase in 
recession risk is clear to see. When short- 
term yields have risen above long- term 
yields in the past, a recession has often fol-
lowed. This pattern has been studied empir-
ically for both Germany and the United 
States.2 In the latter’s case, an inversion of 
the US Treasury yield curve has preceded 
each of the last eight recessions. A false 
positive, when an inversion of this yield 
curve was not followed by a recession in 
about a year, last occurred in 1966.3
Econometric methods can be used to esti-
mate the probability of a fl  attening or inver-
sion of the yield curve preceding an eco-
nomic downturn: specifi  cally, using logistic 
regression, the slope of the yield curve is as-
signed a level of probability with which a 
recession will occur within one year. The 
slope is measured by the term spread be-
tween ten- year and three- month govern-
ment bond yields (10Y- 3M) and the spread 
between ten- year and two- year yields (10Y-

version of the yield curve and practical aspects of esti-
mating probabilities of recession from term spreads,

German data, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2013). Es-
trella and Mishkin (1998) analyse the performance of 
the term spread and other fi  nancial variables as pre-
dictors of US recessions.

2Y). In estimates using US data, recessions 
are usually dated as defi  ned by the NBER. 
The German Council of Economic Experts 
uses a similar method to defi  ne recession 
phases for Germany.4
In the above chart, these German recession 
phases are each assigned a probability of 
recession based on various term spreads. 
The three recessions that have occurred in 
Germany since 1997 were each preceded 
by periods in which the yield curve inverted. 
The estimate shows recession probabilities 
of over 40% for these periods, indicating 
that an inversion is not a sure sign of a 
looming recession. Instead, an inversion 
signals a signifi  cantly above- average prob-
ability of recession compared with periods 
of larger term spreads.5 The probability of 
recession steadily increases as the term 
spread decreases. Given the distribution 
function in the chart on p. 67, a term spread 
of zero is therefore an arbitrary value that is assigned a relatively high probability of a fu-
ture recession.
While, prior to 2022, the recessionary sig-
nals from the two measures employed to 
calculate the slope were similarly clear, their 
strength has diverged since the start of 
2022 due to the maturities the measures 
use. Based on the 10Y- 2Y spread, the prob-
ability of recession stood at 52% as at the 
end of December 2022. This is thus far 
stronger than the signal from the 10Y- 3M 
spread, which, for that point in time, indi-
cated an only 17% probability of a looming

the 10Y- 3M spread, some market participants also

recession.6 The technical reason for this dis-
crepancy is the exceptional shape of the 
yield curve. The slope is very steep, espe-
cially in the maturity range of up to two 
years, before fl  attening off somewhat in the 
subsequent medium to long- term maturity 
range. This maturity- specifi  c difference re-
fl  ects two things. First, market participants 
have been expecting the Eurosystem to 
continue to rapidly normalise monetary pol-
icy in view of the medium- term infl  ation 
outlook – that is to say, market participants 
and the Eurosystem have been anticipating 
infl  ation rates above the infl  ation target of 
2% over the medium- term forecast horizon. 
Second, the fl  at yield curve for medium to 
longer- term maturities refl  ects recessionary 
concerns. As current infl  ationary pressures 
are very pronounced, market participants 
do not currently expect the central bank to 
react to a deterioration in the economic 
outlook by cutting policy rates. Monetary 
policy needs to be tightened to achieve its 
aim of 2% infl  ation over the medium term, 
even if a recession could occur. At the cur-
rent end, this market view is captured more 
by the 10Y- 2Y spread than by the 10Y- 3M 
spread.7 The volatile term spreads of recent 
months have translated into volatile reces-
sion probabilities via the estimated relation-
ship.
Non- standard monetary policy measures 
have also infl  uenced the steepness of the 
yield curve in recent years. The asset pur-
chase programme (APP) and the pandemic 
emergency purchase programme (PEPP) 
were aimed, in particular, at reducing long- 
term yields in the capital market. As a re-
sult, the term premium fell to historically 
low and, at times, negative levels.8 When 
term premia are low, even expectations of 
small interest rate cuts can bring about in-
versions. From this, the model then tends to 
derive higher probabilities of recession. The 
impact of non- standard monetary policy measures of this kind on long- term yields is 
not directly measurable. However, it can be 
estimated using structural models. The fi  rst 
step is to determine the impact of the two 
purchase programmes, which have been 
running since 2015, on the ten- year Bund 
yield. The various term spreads that are 
6 Bauer and Mertens (2022) discuss a similar pattern 
for the US yield curve.
7 In recent months, the gap between the two term 
spreads has revealed the market developments to 
which investors have been paying particular attention. 
In the summer of 2022, recessionary concerns pre-
vailed. Markets were expecting monetary policy to 
move away from its original tightening path. As a re-
sult, the short end of the yield curve fl  attened signifi  -
cantly between June and August, bringing the two 
term spreads back closer together. The probability of 
recession calculated from the 10Y- 3M term spread 
therefore also increased signifi  cantly for a time during 
these months.
8 The purchase programmes have contributed to 
lower long- term yields via the expectations compon-
ent, but above all via the term premium; see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2016).Distribution of recession probabilities as 
a function of term spreads

then used in the recession estimates are ad-
justed for this effect.9
The impact of this adjustment on the prob-
ability of recession is particularly evident for 
2020 and 2021, the years shaped by the 
pandemic. While the unadjusted term 
spreads foresaw a signifi  cantly higher risk of 
recession for the entire period, the prob-
ability of a recession fell rapidly after the 
outbreak of the pandemic in the spring of 
2020 in the case of the adjusted 10Y- 3M 
term spread. Since the Eurosystem had a 
major impact on long- term government 
bond yields through its purchases under the 
PEPP (and the continuation of the APP at 
the same time), the probability of recession 
is signifi  cantly higher over this period based 
on the unadjusted term spreads. Adjust-
ment eliminates any potential “false sig-
nals”, though it does come with its own 
specifi  c limitations. For example, this ap-
proach cannot account for whether market 
participants expect adjustments to the pur-
chase programmes. This becomes evident 
in the second half of 2014, when expect-
ations about the upcoming launch of the 
APP led to a signifi  cant drop in longer- term 
yields even before any actual decision was 
made regarding the programme. As these 
effects are not captured, the adjusted term 
spread also assesses the risk of recession in 
2014 as high. A similar effect could also 
materialise at present. Changes in market 
participants’ expectations about an earlier 
reduction in the Eurosystem’s securities 
holdings from 2023 are already reducing 
the dampening effect of the securities hold-
ings on long- term interest rates. At the cur-
rent end, therefore, probabilities of reces-
sion based on the adjusted term spread 
tend to be deemed as lower.9 Specifi  cally, the Eurosystem’s bond purchases under 
the APP and PEPP are modelled in the DSGE model of 
Kühl (2018). With the announcement of each pur-
chase programme, agents internalise the future course 
of those programmes, but adjust their expectations 
with each calibration of the programmes. The model 
allows for the calculation of what are known as dur-
ation extraction effects, which are regarded as one of 
the main channels for the impact of bond purchases 
on yields (see, for example, Krishnamurthy and Vissing- 
Jorgensen (2012)). Expectations about possible adjust-
ments to the purchase programmes or other possible 
effects of such programmes (such as signalling effects) 
are not taken into account. Only the term spread be-
tween the ten- year and three- month yields is adjusted 
for the effect of the purchase programmes. The reason 
for this is that the three- month yield is infl  uenced more 
by the policy rate than by purchase programmes, and 
an adjustment of the ten- year yield is therefore suffi   -

two- year yields, both maturities would have had to be

that short- term yields have sometimes ex -
ceeded long- term yields. The slope of the yield 
curve was thus a summary of expectations re -
garding the degree of monetary policy restric -
tion and, with that in mind, cyclical risk (for in -
formation on the indicator function of the yield 
curve for future recessions, see the box on 
pp. 65ff.). At the current end, it signals a fairly 
high probability of recession by historical stand -
ards. However, it should be noted when inter -
preting the situation that the level of the de -
rived probability does not necessarily provide 
an indication of the severity or duration of a 
possible recession.
Another historical pattern is the evolution of 
the term premium over the business cycle. The 
nominal term premium, which includes the in -
flation risk premium, increased worldwide with 
a time lag in the 1970s as a result of the oil 
price shocks. The reason for this was that the 
degree by which the monetary policy stance 
was restricted in the major currency areas was not sufficient at that time to quickly stabilise 
the inflation process. While central banks did 
also raise policy rates in the 1970s – in some 
cases significantly – in view of soaring inflation 
rates,24 inflation and interest rate volatility were 
strong. The associated uncertainty was accom -
panied by rising inflation risk premia globally. 
Only a few central banks, such as the Bundes -
bank and the Swiss National Bank, were able 
– with greater emphasis on rules-based con -
duct geared towards price stability – to curb in -
flation and the inflation risk premium some -
what more strongly. On the whole, however, 
this inflation uncertainty, and thus the nominal 
term premium, remained comparatively high – 
even after inflation was successfully reined in in 
the 1980s.
At present, the term premium and the inflation 
risk premium are at a rising, but historically still Development

very low, level. For example, the nominal term 
premium on ten- year Bunds since 1967 has 
averaged around 190 basis points, whereas it 
stood at just under 10 basis points as at the 
end of December 2022. The Eurosystem’s dur -
ation extraction via the monetary policy pur -
chase programmes described in the previous 
sections as well as the incipient securities scar -
city were the two main factors to push the 
term premium to this low level. This has caused 
potential for setbacks to build up.
The historical co- movement of inflation and the 
term premium is a warning sign for European 
monetary policy. Experience gained over the 
past few decades with supply shocks has 
shown that, even after successful disinflation, 
as in the 1980s, the term premium – once it 
has risen – initially remains at a high level.25 The 
fight against inflation must therefore be made 
top priority in order to ensure that the credibil -
ity of monetary policy remains intact.26 Other -
wise, there is a risk of market participants’ un -
certainty about inflation developments translat -
ing into a de- anchoring of inflation expect -
ations in the medium and long term.
Summary
The yield curve contains valuable and up-  to- 
date information for monetary policy. It reflects 
economic developments and the impact of 
monetary policy measures. This article discusses 
how the Bundesbank uses this information 
with the aid of numerous term structure 
models. In the current environment of persist -
ently high inflation, the analyses show that market participants expect further policy rate 
hikes. In addition, since the end of active net 
asset purchases and the reduction of the mon -
etary policy securities portfolio announced in 
December 2022, the impact of asset purchase 
programmes on interest rates has been grad -
ually declining. This was recently reflected in 
rising nominal term premia, which came under 
additional upward pressure in the context of 
very high inflation and cyclical risk.
However, yields on Federal securities also in -
clude liquidity premia, which make it more dif -
ficult to interpret changes in interest rates as a 
mirror of expectations surrounding economic 
developments. In practice, regulatory and insti -
tutional factors also influence the level and 
course of yields on Federal securities and their 
components.
In the past, nominal term premia have risen in 
particular when, faced with a supply- driven rise 
in inflation, market participants doubted the 
central bank’s determination to combat infla -
tion. A monetary policy that is consistently 
geared to the inflation target can ensure that 
inflation expectations do not become de-  
anchored in view of the current high level of in -
flation uncertainty. This also reduces the risk of 
higher interest rates resulting from perman -
ently increased risk premia.Currently, term 
premia are still

Mobile payment usage in Germany
Mobile payments have gained a foothold in Germany in recent years. The Bundesbank’s represen -
tative studies on payment behaviour in Germany, which are carried out at regular intervals, show 
that this is true of both smartphone payments at the point of sale (POS) and mobile payments 
between individuals (peer- to- peer, or P2P). In the Bank’s most recent study, 5,870 people were 
asked by telephone about their use of payment instruments and their attitudes towards these. 
4,197 of the respondents subsequently filled out a three- day payments diary.
The survey responses reveal that around 3% of transactions at the POS and 3% of P2P payments 
were made by smartphone in 2021. This means that mobile payments are still lagging far behind 
cash and debit and credit cards. However, multiple factors in the study suggest that mobile pay -
ments could gain traction in the future. These include, amongst other things, socio- demographic 
characteristics such as age, as well as respondents’ attitudes towards paying with cash and their 
online purchasing behaviour, for example. In addition, provider- side market developments such 
as the availability of near- field communication (NFC) technology for retailers and customers, 
coupled with regulatory changes, are also likely to boost the uptake of mobile payments.
This article complements the analysis of data from the payment behaviour study with an assess -
ment of the regional prevalence of mobile payments at the POS across German federal states. 
This aspect merits further investigation as these payments become more widespread. A compari -
son with other euro area countries shows that Germany has been slower so far in adopting 
mobile payment methods than most of these countries.
Efforts to establish instant payments as an integral component of European payments in future 
open up additional potential for the expansion of mobile payment methods. This is because 
instant payments, combined with state- of- the- art wallet solutions, could provide the basis for 
attractive service enhancements in mobile payments at the POS, in e- commerce and in P2P trans -
actions. The Bundesbank therefore welcomes pan- European private market initiatives such as the 
European Payments Initiative (EPI). In addition, the insights into user behaviour and preferences 
can also yield important findings that will enrich discussions surrounding the design of a poten -
tial digital euro.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction: Increasing use 
of mobile payment methods 
in Germany
The rapid proliferation of smartphones and 
wearables1 worldwide and the increasing digi -
talisation of society and the economy mean 
that the global market for mobile payments 
has seen very dynamic growth in recent years.2 
Asia, especially, has witnessed the emergence 
of “super apps” – solutions that aim to com -
bine not just payments but also a wide range 
of everyday services on a single platform. But 
Germany, too, is experiencing marked growth 
in mobile payments, albeit from a low starting 
level.
Mobile payments are payments initiated by 
smartphone or wearable. In principle, they can 
be used in different payment situations, such as 
at the POS or in peer- to- peer (P2P) payments.3
The Bundesbank publication “Payment behav -
iour in Germany in 2021” provides an overview 
of the use of mobile payment methods in Ger -
many, amongst other things.4 This study saw 
the market research institute forsa conduct 
telephone interviews with 5,870 people on be -
half of the Bundesbank about their payment 
behaviour and attitudes towards various means 
of payment between 8 September and 5 De -
cember 2021. 4,197 of the respondents subse -
quently filled out a three- day payments diary. 
The sample is representative of the German-  
speaking population aged 18 and over in the 
Federal Republic of Germany in terms of the re -
spondents’ age, gender, level of education and 
place of residence. The mobile payment 
methods covered by this study included Apple 
Pay and Google Pay, banks’ own payment 
apps, Payback Pay and chain store payment 
apps. PayPal and the giropay/ Kwitt5 payment 
app offered by the German banking industry 
were also included, but only for P2P payments.
Many of these mobile payment methods can 
be used for e-  commerce, which sometimes 
makes it difficult to clearly distinguish them from the general use of e- payment methods.6 
This has led many studies, and this article, too, 
to define mobile payments as payments made 
at physical locations (i.e. at the POS) and as P2P 
payments.7
An earlier article has already demonstrated 
that, in addition to the growing importance of 
e- commerce and thus the proliferation of spe -
cialised e- payment methods, broader smart -
phone use has also spurred the development of 
new solutions for paying at the POS.8 In 2021, 
according to the Bundesbank’s most recent 
payment behaviour study, 38% of respondents 
making mobile payments at the POS utilised 
Apple Pay, followed by banks’ and savings 
banks’ payment apps (25%) and Google Pay 
(18%).9 Mobile payment methods can often 
also be used for P2P payments. Study partici -
pants mostly turned to PayPal or giropay/ Kwitt 
for this purpose.10
The increasing uptake of mobile payments at 
the POS is reflected in the Bundesbank’s previ -
ous surveys on payment behaviour: in 2017, 
only 2% of respondents stated that they had 
already paid by smartphone at least once in a Mobile pay -
ments slowly 
gaining traction 
in Germany
1 These include, for example, fitness wristbands and smart 
watches. Some of these devices support NFC-enabled pay -
ments.
2 The Bundesbank illuminated trends and developments in 
payments most recently in its September 2012, December 
2013 and June 2019 Monthly Reports. See Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2012, 2013, 2019).
3 E- commerce payments do not count as mobile pay -
ments, even where the online purchase is made via smart -
phone. P2P payments are money sent via an app to family, 
friends or acquaintances.
4 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a).
5 The P2P payment solution Kwitt is being incorporated 
into the giropay payment service offered by German banks 
and savings banks.
6 Examples include PayPal, Klarna/ Sofort (Pay now) and the 
German banking industry’s giropay/ paydirekt service.
7 Unless stated otherwise, the figures and statistics pro -
vided in this article are taken from the latest Bundesbank 
study on payment behaviour. The shares of turnover and 
transactions accounted for by individual means of payment 
as well as the importance of payment locations were calcu -
lated on the basis of the entries in the payments diaries. 
The other data are based on respondents’ assessments as 
derived from the questionnaires. See Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022a).

store; by 2020, this figure had risen to 11% 
within the space of three years. In 2021, 15% 
of all respondents were already reporting that 
they had utilised this payment method at least 
once.11 Growth was evident, too, in the shares 
of mobile payment methods used for the trans -
actions and turnover at the POS recorded in the 
payments diaries (see the adjacent chart): while 
they were still too small to be visible in 2017, 
2% of all transactions and turnover at the POS 
were already being settled using mobile pay -
ment methods in 2020. In 2021, their market 
share grew to around 3%.12
With regard to P2P payments by smartphone, 
5% of all respondents stated in the Bundes -
bank’s 2017 payment behaviour study that 
they had already sent or received money using 
an app at least once. In 2020 and 2021, that 
figure had already increased to 27% and 28%, 
respectively.13 However, these high percent -
ages are not yet reflected in the payments diar -
ies, with a mere 3% of P2P transactions and 
turnover being settled using a mobile app in 
2021.
Factors influencing the use 
of mobile payment methods
This article now turns to the factors influencing 
the use of smartphone payments at the POS 
and the use of P2P payment methods, drawing 
on respondents’ feedback to qualitative ques -
tions in the 2021 payment behaviour study de -
scribed above.14 The first step is to present the 
individual impact of socio- demographic charac -
teristics as well as certain personal attitudes 
and respondent behaviours, before using a re -
gression approach to test the results. The fol -
lowing section begins by studying the persons 
who indicate that they have already paid by 
smartphone at the POS.15 Next, those who 
have made P2P payments are considered.Descriptive analysis of survey 
results
The respondents were asked whether they had 
already made at least one mobile payment at 
the POS, to which they could answer either 
“yes” or “no”. The next step was to investigate 
how far the following factors were useful in ex -
plaining the respondents’ behaviour: gender, 
age, level of school education, employment 
and the financial situation of the respondent’s 
household (the possible answers for the latter 
being “very good”, “good”, “not so good” and 
“bad”). This investigation was also based on 
how the respondents had answered the ques -
tions on behaviour and preferences, such as 2021 payment 
behaviour study 
used as basis for

11 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018, 2021, 2022a). In the 
2020 and 2021 payment behaviour studies, the subsample 
is all smartphone owners (84% and 89% of respondents, 
respectively). Based on this subsample, 13% (2020) and 
17% (2021) of smartphone owners state that they have al -
ready used mobile payments at the POS at least once.
12 This corresponds to 236 mobile payments at the POS,

concerning (1) how frequently they make inter -
net purchases, (2) their use of online banking, 
(3) their trust in certain companies to handle 
personal data responsibly, (4) concerns about 
how personal data could be used, and (5) their 
preference for cash versus non- cash means of 
payment.
The table on p. 79 provides a comprehensive 
overview of the surveyed behaviours and pref -
erences as well as the attributes used. Column 
“N” shows how many study participants an -
swered the questions listed above (a total of 
5,119 persons), while the “Total” column lists 
the shares of respondents who agree with the 
attributes of the variable in question or to 
whom they apply. For example, 5,113 people 
answered the question of which means of pay -
ment they prefer to use at the POS if the choice 
is theirs. Of these respondents, a total of 24% 
favour cash, while 47% prefer to pay by card or 
another non- cash means of payment.
The next columns, “Users” and “Non- users”, 
show the differences in responses between in -
dividuals who use a mobile device for POS pay -
ments and those who do not. In this case, 9% 
of mobile payers (“users”) prefer cash and 71% 
favour cards or other non- cash means of pay -
ment. By contrast, 28% of those who have 
never used mobile payment methods (“non-  
users”) show a preference for cash, while 42% 
prefer to use cards or other non- cash means of 
payment. The deviation of the mean values in 
the responses of these two groups (the “Differ -
ence” column) and the t-values16 in the last col -
umn shows the extent to which the variable in 
question has an impact on mobile payments at 
the POS, if at all. In this exercise, the aforemen -
tioned determinants are considered independ -
ently of each other.
On balance, people who (1) favour cards or 
non- cash means of payment, (2) make internet 
purchases once a week or more, and (3) bank 
online are particularly inclined to use their 
smartphones or wearables to pay at the POS. 
Other important factors for mobile payments at the POS are whether respondents (4) work 
full- time, (5) have a higher-  grade school leav -
ing certificate, and (6) are 35 to under 45 years 
of age. Moreover, (7) the option to use cash is 
not important at all or not so important to 
them. By contrast, non- users of such means of 
payment comprise somewhat more women 
and persons aged 65 and older, as well as 
those respondents who rarely shop online, pre -
fer to use cash at the POS and consider cash 
usage to be very important.
Another factor associated with mobile pay -
ments is whether respondents trust technology 
companies to handle personal data responsibly. 
The proliferation of Apple and Google’s mobile 
payment methods is presumably important in 
this regard. Overall, female respondents tend 
to trust technology companies less (difference 
of 6 percentage points between the genders). 
In addition, respondents who have already 
bought or paid with crypto- tokens have more 
of a tendency to make mobile payments than 
those who are planning to neither purchase 
nor use them. Here, this factor is interpreted as 
an indicator of participants’ willingness to 
adopt new technology. That said, only 5% of 
respondents actually reported owning crypto-  
tokens or using them as a means of payment. 
Due to the small size of the reporting sample, 
though, the statistical estimation is less robust, 
meaning that the actual influence of this factor 
merits further investigation. The same holds for 
the concern that money could be stolen from 
an account as a result of data misuse.
For all the other factors considered in the table 
on p. 79, there is little difference between the 
mean values of the two groups, with the result 
that they cannot independently explain the use 
of mobile payment methods at the POS, even if 
the t-test values are significant in some cases. 
The statistical analysis presented further below 
aims to shed more light on this matter.Indicators for

The same analytical approach and factors as 
above can be applied to explain the use of mo -
bile devices for P2P payments. The distinction 
between “users” and “non- users” in this case is 
based on whether respondents have already 
utilised an app to send money to family, friends 
or acquaintances at least once, which, as 
above, is asked as a “yes”/”no” question. Over -
all, the results presented in the table on p. 81 
are broadly in line with the remarks on mobile 
payments at the POS.
Reports from other countries such as Sweden17 
and China show that people who have had 
positive experiences with mobile P2P methods 
are more likely to be willing to employ mobile 
payments at the POS as well. If a similar mech -
anism plays out in Germany, too, this could 
lead to mobile payments at the POS gaining in 
importance in future. After all, 34% of re -
spondents who own a smartphone and are fa -
miliar with PayPal or giropay/ Kwitt reported 
that they have already used these at least once 
to send money to friends or family. Yet the up -
take of mobile payments at the POS has been 
lower to date, with only 18% of respondents 
owning a smartphone and being familiar with 
at least one mobile payment method reporting 
that they have already used these to pay at the 
POS.
Regression analysis of factors 
for mobile payments at the 
POS and in P2P transactions
To gain a clearer picture of how the determin -
ants investigated so far affect smartphone pay -
ments at the POS on the one hand and P2P 
payments on the other, a logistic regression 
model was estimated in each case.18 For ease 
of interpretation, the average marginal effects 
relative to the relevant reference group are 
studied in the following. These are presented 
separately for POS and P2P in the chart on 
p. 82 for four main factors with the following 
reference groups: (1) frequency of internet 
 purchases: at least once per week, (2) use of crypto- tokens: already purchased or paid with 
crypto- tokens, (3) importance of option to use 
cash: not so important, and (4) age group: 45 
to under 55 years.19
As already suggested by the descriptive statis -
tics on smartphone payments at the POS and 
on the use of P2P payments, the probability of 
use decreases in both cases as online activity 
declines. Compared with respondents who 
make internet purchases at least once a week 
(reference group), the probability of making 
mobile payments at the POS and of using P2P 
payment methods is consistently significantly 
lower for individuals who shop online less fre -
quently. For those who make online purchases 
at least once a month, the probability is 10 per -
centage points lower than that of the reference 
group in both cases, for example. By contrast, 
banking online is associated with a 10 and 
11 percentage point higher probability of mak -
ing mobile POS and P2P payments, respect -
ively.20
There therefore appears to be a positive medi -
ating effect between familiarity with the online 
world and mobile payment applications. Such 
mediating effects have also been documented 
for other countries, such as the United States,21 
China22 and India.23 Furthermore, the data can 
be interpreted as indicating that willingness to 
adopt new technology has a positive impact on 
the use of mobile devices in payments. That hy -
pothesis is also supported by the observed rela -Indicators for

18 For an overview of the logistic regression analysis, see 
Amemiya (1981) and McFadden (1984).
19 The evaluation included effects that are statistically sig -
nificant at the 1% and 5% levels. The marginal effect indi -
cates the magnitude of the difference in the probability of 
use of the dependent variable (in this case, mobile pay -
ment at the POS or P2P) of a person with the observed 
characteristic (e.g. 18 to under 25 years of age) compared 
with the reference group (e.g. 45 to under 55 years of 
age). The mean of the differences in the probability of use 
across all observations in the dataset then gives the aver -
age marginal effect.
20 As this is a dummy variable (reference group: non- use 
of online banking), it was omitted from the chart.

tionships between the attitude towards crypto- 
tokens and the use of mobile payment 
methods. Another possible indication is that 
the probability of using mobile payments at the 
POS is 6 percentage points higher among the 
respondents who believe that personal data 
are being handled responsibly by technology 
companies. Incidentally, the significance of the 
willingness to adopt new technology was also 
borne out by a qualitative study drawn up for 
the Eurosystem in 2022 in connection with the 
digital euro project.24
The attitude towards cash is another significant 
indicator for the use of mobile payment appli -
cations. Respondents who prefer to pay with 
cash at the POS are 15 percentage points less 
likely to turn to mobile payment methods. 
Where respondents have no clear preference 
for either cash or non- cash means of payment, 
the probability of them using mobile payment 
methods decreases by 6 percentage points. For 
P2P payments, meanwhile, the preferred means 
of payment holds no relevance.25 An analysis of 
the importance of cash use yields similar in -
sights. For example, the probability of making 
payments via mobile devices drops by 5 (POS) 
and 8 percentage points (P2P) for respondents 
for whom cash use is very or fairly important.
An analysis by age group shows that the prob -
ability of paying with a mobile device is up to 
19 (POS) and 27 percentage points (P2P) higher 
for the younger age group (18 to under 45 
years) than for the reference group (45 to 
under 55 years). For P2P payments, further -
more, the probability of use for respondents in 
the higher age groups (65 years and older) is 
up to 18  percentage points lower compared 
with the reference group, whereas for mobile 
payments at the POS, no significant effect is 
discernible with increasing age. This means 
that the probability of making P2P payments 
decreases with age across all groups; in the Younger age 
groups more 
likely to use

case of mobile POS payments, this can only be 
observed up to the reference group age. The 
negative correlation between age and use of 
mobile payment applications is also well docu -
mented in the literature.26
The opinion that technology companies handle 
personal data responsibly is associated with a 
6 percentage point higher probability of using 
mobile payments at the POS. Where P2P pay -
ments by app are concerned, the probability of 
use decreases by 9 and 7 percentage points, 
respectively, among respondents with a lower 
or higher secondary school leaving certificate 
compared with the reference group (upper sec -
ondary school leaving certificate).
In summary, it is evident that above all experi -
ence with internet applications, a willingness to 
try out new technology, attitudes towards cash 
and age are good indicators of the use of mo -
bile payments at the POS and in P2P transac -
tions. The empirical analysis was therefore able 
to confirm the findings of the previous descrip -
tive study.
Geographical proliferation of 
mobile payments at the POS 
in Germany and Europe
The next step is to add a geographical dimen -
sion to this analysis of the key determinants of 
mobile payments at the POS.
Regional comparison at federal 
state level
The chart on p. 84 is based on transaction data 
taken from the payments diaries completed as 
part of the latest payment behaviour study, ac -
cording to which 2.6% of transactions at the 
POS in Germany were made using mobile pay -
ment methods in 2021. Broken down by fed -
eral state, the distribution is fairly heteroge -
neous, with Rhineland- Palatinate, Hesse and 
the northern federal states – except for Ham -burg – accounting for an above- average num -
ber of mobile payments. Mecklenburg-  West 
Pomerania leads this group with a share of 
5.5%. All the other federal states fall short 
of  the average, with Hamburg and Baden-  
Württemberg coming in just below that level, 
at 2.5% each. The number of mobile payments 
is particularly small in Saxony-  Anhalt, Thuringia 
and Saarland. As the number of transactions at 
the federal state level is still relatively small in 
absolute terms, an empirical analysis of the 
causes of these differences would not yet be 
meaningful. Future Bundesbank payment be -
haviour studies, however, could permit a more 
detailed analysis of regional differences as the 
volume of mobile POS payments continues to 
rise.Use of mobile

Comparison across euro area 
countries
To get a better idea of where Germany stands 
with regard to smartphone payments, it is 
worth looking at how the country shapes up 
relative to its euro area peers in the SPACE 
study prepared by the European Central Bank 
(ECB).27 Just like the Bundesbank’s payment be -
haviour study, the SPACE study looks at peo -
ple’s payment habits and attitudes towards the 
available means of payment as well as trends in 
payment transactions, but does so throughout 
the euro area. To this end, the market research 
institute Kantar conducted a representative sur -
vey among a total of 50,000 persons in all euro 
area countries (except Germany and the Neth -
erlands) by telephone and online, and had the 
respondents complete a payments diary. The 
study was rounded out by incorporating data 
from the national payment behaviour surveys 
conducted in Germany and the Netherlands.The average share of mobile transactions at 
physical payment locations excluding P2P pay -
ments is 3% in the euro area. The adjacent 
chart shows the results for all the euro area 
countries. Eleven countries are above this level 
and eight below it. Of particular note are the 
high percentages in Finland (6.4%) and the 
Netherlands (10.5%), the latter percentage re -
flecting the strong popularity of Apple Pay and 
Google Pay in the Netherlands. Card payments 
at the POS reached a very high level as well 
(80%), with the vast majority being contactless 
or smartphone/ wearable transactions.28 Ireland 
and Latvia are also well above the euro area 
average at just below 6%, possibly reflecting a 
relative openness to technology and advances 
in digitalisation in these countries. The same 
could also be said about the other Baltic States 
and Slovakia, where the shares of mobile 
transactions  lie between 3.2% and 3.8%. The 
above- average percentages in Spain and Portu -
gal, meanwhile, could be attributable, at least 
in part, to the national mobile payment sys -
tems Bizum and MB Way. At a share of 2.4%29 
for mobile payments, Germany occupies a mid- 
table position in Europe, albeit below the euro 
area average. This raises the question of why 
developments in Germany in this respect have 
so far been rather lacking in momentum.
Possible reasons for the low 
uptake of mobile payments 
in Germany so far
The still moderate growth overall of mobile 
payments in Germany can be traced back to 
various economic and technological factors as 
well as market- specific growth paths that are 
always affected to a degree by whether the 
network effects needed in payments have been 
achieved or not. Originally, efforts were made Mobile pay -

in Germany to use optical methods such as bar -
codes or QR codes for mobile payments. These 
first initiatives were set in motion either by re -
tailers or mobile telephone operators, rather 
than originating in the banking industry. One 
early QR code- based payment solution was 
Yapital, a subsidiary of the Otto group.30 How -
ever, due to an insufficient number of users, 
operations were discontinued back at the be -
ginning of 2016.
Solutions that are still in the market are QR 
code- based POS payment methods such as 
Payback Pay – which is an enhancement to the 
well- known multi- partner bonus programme – 
and the chain store payment apps.
NFC technology, by contrast, is used in a form 
of mobile payment method that is employed 
by both the German girocard and international 
contactless card schemes.31 While girocard has 
only been rolled out in bulk with the contact -
less function since 2017,32 Mastercard and Visa 
already came equipped with an NFC chip sev -
eral years earlier. However, acceptance among 
retailers was slow, which limited the spread of 
contactless payments. Things only changed 
when the two card schemes forced their re -
tailer customers to use NFC- enabled terminals 
by no later than 2020.
Initially, it was only possible to use the credit 
cards issued by international card schemes – 
but not girocard, which is widespread in Ger -
many. However, according to the payment be -
haviour study, only 54% of respondents cur -
rently have a credit card. Of these, 32% have 
added that card to a payment app. By contrast, 
according to the study, almost all respondents 
own debit cards, most of which are girocards, 
but only 23% have registered their card in a 
payment app.
Evidently, the application landscape for mobile 
payments is still highly fragmented by smart -
phone operating system and centred around 
international card schemes: in general, NFC 
payments using credit and debit cards issued by international schemes are possible via Apple 
Pay and Google Pay, provided they cooperate 
with the card- issuing bank. Android generally 
allows the NFC interface to be used by bank-  
owned payment apps – including with giro -
card. On iOS devices, on the other hand, the 
NFC interface was long the reserve of Apple 
Pay. To add girocard to Apple Pay, additional 
technical modifications need to be made to fa -
cilitate payment processing, alongside the ap -
propriate contractual agreements. Thus, the 
ability to use NFC in mobile payments at the 
POS depends on the available card, the card-  
issuing bank and the smartphone’s operating 
system. The amendments to Section 58a of the 
German Payment Services Oversight Act33 as 
well as the EU’s Digital Markets Act34 are de -
signed to facilitate access to the NFC interface. 
This might increase the use of girocard for mo -
bile payments, which, given their popularity 
and proliferation among the general public, 
could help to fuel further growth in mobile 
payments.35
As mentioned above, card issuers generally 
need to cooperate with wallet providers in 
order to use digital wallets outside of bank-  
owned payment apps. Savings banks and credit 
cooperatives spent a long time focused on en -
abling girocard to be integrated into third- party 
wallets such as Apple Pay in the same way as it 
is in the bank’s own apps.36 Only since the end 
of 2019 have customers of both types of banks 
been able to use Apple Pay in combination 
with their credit card. And since the third quar -
ter of 2020, it has been possible to add giro -Card schemes

How mobile payments work at the point of sale
Two factors are usually required for mobile 
payments at the point of sale (POS): the 
customer needs a smartphone or wearable 
that comes with a payment function, plus a 
debit or credit card that is stored virtually 
on that device in a suitable wallet. Technic-
ally speaking, then, mobile payments at the 
POS are generally contactless card pay-
ments initiated from the mobile device.1 
That device is scanned over the payment 
terminal to allow the payment app to ex-
change the payment information with the 
POS terminal via the smartphone or wear-
able’s NFC (near-fi  eld communication) an-
tenna. In a smartphone payment, authenti-
cation – i.e. verifi  cation of the user’s iden-
tity – takes place either with the aid of bio-
metric verifi  cation methods such as a 
fi  ngerprint or face scan or – as in the case 
of wearable payments – by entering the de-
vice’s PIN.2 The payment messages ex-
changed via NFC are processed via the in-
frastructure of the respective card scheme, 
as with payments by physical card.
To reduce fraud risks, payment details are 
stored not on the device’s operating sys-
tem, which is where the bulk of other data 
is kept, but either provisioned into a secure 
element built into the mobile device (e.g. a 
chip embedded in the device’s SIM card) or 
stored remotely on cloud servers operated 
by a suitable provider (a confi  guration 
known as host card emulation, or HCE).3
One key difference between contactless 
card payments and mobile payments con-
cerns the nature of the information ex-
changed between device and terminal. 
Whilst a contactless payment made using a 
physical card involves the direct transfer of 
the associated card information, in a mobile 
payment only tokenised payment details are stored and transferred. In this context, 
tokenised means that a designated tech-
nical service provider –  the token service 
provider – generates one or more new vir-
tual card numbers, known as payment 
tokens, from an existing card number.4 
These are placed, or provisioned, into a 
smartphone’s or wearable’s wallet when 
the device connects to the internet. Third 
parties such as retailers are unable to match 
the payment token with a physical card. 
Payment tokens are each virtual cards in 
their own right and are time- limited and, in 
some cases, domain and purpose- specifi  c. 
For the most part, they can only be used for 
a single transaction. This means that if the 
device is hacked or stolen, the information 
on it is only usable for a limited amount of 
time and money. To add a further layer of 
security for mobile payments, the digital 
wallet generates a dynamic cryptogram 
that is sent to the terminal together with 
the payment token. Without that crypto-
gram the payment token is useless.
1 See Payment Systems Regulator (2018). Some pro-
viders, such as Payback Pay, or the payment apps oper-
ated by some chain stores take a different approach, 
settling the payment by debiting the amount directly 
from the payer’s bank account. Likewise, payments 
made via the PayPal app or website are not a card- 
based mobile payment method but a transfer of elec-
tronic money, because the virtual card is used only to 
charge the user’s electronic money account with Pay-
Pal, not for the payment transaction itself. See Göbel 
(2021).
2 See Baumgartner (2019a), Oppong (2020) and 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a). Depending on the de-
vice and payment app used, it is also suffi   cient to enter 
the PIN once (e.g. by scanning the smartwatch).

card to Apple Pay, but only if that card was is -
sued by a savings bank.37
In addition, there are reports from the market 
that the cooperating institutions are required to 
pay a fee of up to 0.15% of the transaction 
value for each Apple Pay payment when a 
credit card is added and 0.05% for debit 
cards.38 This reduces card issuers’ earnings. For 
them, an interchange fee, or “authorisation 
fee” in the case of girocard – payable by the re -
tailer per transaction – is an important source 
of income. Interchange fees generally amount 
to 0.3% of the transaction value for credit 
cards and 0.2% for debit cards issued by the 
international schemes.39 According to the lat -
est survey conducted by the EHI Retail Institute 
in spring 2022, authorisation fees for girocard 
payments averaged 0.17% of the transaction 
value, and came to 0.14% on average for large 
enterprises.40 In view of these costs paid to 
third- party wallet providers, issuing cards could 
make less and less commercial sense for the 
banks concerned. This is probably one of the 
reasons why girocard has so far only been par -
tially integrated into the wallet products offered 
by major technology providers.
On top of the reasons cited so far for the as yet 
low uptake of NFC payments at the POS using 
a smartphone, users are concerned that mobile 
payments might entail security risks. For ex -
ample, 42% of respondents in the payment be -
haviour study stated that they did not make 
mobile payments because they seemed too in -
secure. Many consumers still appear to be un -
aware of the additional level of security pro -
vided by tokenisation compared with a physical 
card payment.41
Outlook
This analysis has shown that the use of smart -
phones to make payments at the POS or to 
send money P2P is above- average among 
younger age groups in particular. Demographic 
developments thus make it likely that the use of mobile payment methods will increase in the 
future. Moreover, buyers are more inclined to 
make mobile payments when they are familiar 
with shopping and banking online. If the gen -
eral public’s uptake of mobile internet services 
evolves as it has done in recent years,42 and on -
line shopping and banking therefore continue 
to grow, this could also help spread the use of 
mobile payments.
Furthermore, a certain degree of openness to 
technological trends is likely to boost the will -
ingness to pay by smartphone at the POS or 
in  P2P transactions, as is the growing trend 
towards  preferring non- cash means of pay -
ment at the POS.43
Experience has shown that for an innovative 
– and therefore also mobile – payment method 
to succeed, it needs to offer consumers an 
additional benefit in the form of greater con -
venience, such as in how long the payment 
process takes. Two recent studies show that 
payments by smartphone or wearable are fast -
est compared with other means of payment, 
taking an average of 11 and 14 seconds, re -
spectively.44
The reasons for the low prevalence of mobile 
payments in Germany to date were the late 
availability of the infrastructure needed to set -
tle NFC- based payments and the cautious co -
operation of banks and savings banks with 
third- party providers. However, these barriers 
are gradually being removed – including 
through appropriate regulation. In particular, 
the prospect of being able to use any girocard 
regardless of the issuing institution in the rele -
vant digital wallets is likely to boost smart -
phone payments.Card issuers may 
incur additional 
fees that could

Alongside banks and savings banks, PayPal is 
also looking to capitalise on its popularity and 
broad user base45 in online and P2P payments 
to expand into the POS business field, where 
payments can be made using a QR code or – in 
conjunction with Google Pay and Mastercard – 
via NFC. To date, Bluecode has been a niche 
product for making payments at the POS. It 
works on the basis of an optical code and is 
part of the European Mobile Payment Systems 
Association (EMPSA). The main purpose of this 
association is to link payment apps in different 
European countries so that they can be used 
seamlessly across multiple countries.46 An alter -
native approach is the creation of a completely 
new pan- European mobile payment method 
based on instant payments and QR codes to 
initiate payment. This is currently being dis -
cussed by various European banks, especially in 
France, Germany, Belgium and the Nether -
lands, under the acronym EPI. In Germany, the 
initiative is supported by large parts of the 
banking industry.
Instant payments in particular have the 
potential  to form the basis for mobile POS, 
e- commerce and P2P payment applications in 
the future. In the past, successful mobile pay -
ment solutions have been developed in some 
European countries, such as Sweden, Denmark 
and Spain, that focused initially on P2P pay -
ments before being gradually expanded to 
e- commerce and the POS. With Europe’s pay -ments market still fragmented – as is also evi -
dent from the analysis of mobile payments at 
physical locations in the euro area47 – the Bun -
desbank believes that the opportunity should 
be taken to establish a pan- European mobile 
payment method based on instant payments, 
as is envisaged with EPI, for example. The 
planned European regulation of instant pay -
ments may support this process.48 At the same 
time, the existing insights into payment behav -
iour could be leveraged to examine – as part of 
the Eurosystem’s work on the topic – the de -
sign features that a digital euro would need to 
have in order to be perceived as an attractive 
means of payment.49
Overall, the uptake of mobile payment methods 
is likely to increase significantly over the next 
few years. However, it remains to be seen how 
quickly the factors identified here will pick up 
momentum and how regulatory developments 
will affect payments in the coming years.

Access to cash in Germany:  
analyses of the spatial availability of cash 
withdrawal facilities
In the December 2022 issue of the Monthly Report, the Bundesbank’s experts demonstrated that 
the overwhelming majority of citizens consider the effort involved in getting to an ATM or to a 
bank counter to be low or very low. The average time required per withdrawal is approximately 
nine minutes. These results are based on the responses to a representative public survey. This art -
icle will use location data to analyse the spatial availability of cash withdrawal facilities in order 
to obtain a broader picture of access to cash in Germany.
Cash is in demand in Germany as a means of payment and store of value; only if cash is avail -
able can citizens decide freely how they wish to pay and save. Cash is likewise important to 
ensure financial inclusion for all in our society, and it may constitute the only means of payment 
available at short notice in emergency and crisis situations. The Bundesbank, together with the 
other Eurosystem central banks, is therefore committed to ensuring that euro banknotes and 
coins remain available as a means of payment and store of value at all times going forward.
Consumers stock up on cash at automated teller machines (ATMs) and bank counters, in particu -
lar. At the same time, a steady dismantling of these traditional sources of cash has been observed 
in recent years. While the number of ATMs in Germany stood at around 59,000 in 2018, this fig -
ure had shrunk to just over 55,000 ATMs by 2021. In the same period, the number of bank 
branches fell from just under 30,000 to roughly 23,000; compared with 2006, the number even 
halved. At the same time, however, options to withdraw cash at the point of sale have gained in 
importance in recent years.
What can be said about access to cash in Germany in the light of these diverging developments? 
Analyses of the geographical distribution and availability of cash withdrawal facilities in munici -
palities show that 79.8 million citizens, or 96% of Germany’s population, can withdraw cash at 
a bank branch or an ATM located in their own municipality. At the same time, however, the resi -
dents of a number of municipalities have to leave their municipalities to reach the nearest source 
of cash withdrawals.
In general, citizens have to cover an average of 1.7 km to withdraw cash at the nearest ATM or 
bank counter. 76.3 million consumers, around 92% of the population, have the option of with -
drawing cash at a point of sale within their municipality. The average distance to the nearest 
point of sale is 2.9 km. In most cases, therefore, bank- based sources of cash are geographically 
more attractive for withdrawals.
These results suggest that the population of Germany is currently well supplied with cash thanks 
to a dense network of cash withdrawal facilities. However, the cash infrastructure will remain 
intact only if credit institutions in Germany continue to meet their responsibilities for the cash sup -
ply going forward.Deutsche Bundesbank

Importance of cash and 
withdrawal sources
Cash is widely used in Germany as a means of 
payment and store of value. According to the 
results of the Bundesbank’s recently published 
payment behaviour study, respondents carry an 
average of €100 in cash in their wallets and use 
cash to settle 58% of their day- to- day pay -
ments.1 Measured by turnover, 30% of all pay -
ments are settled in cash. This makes cash the 
most commonly used means of payment in 
Germany. Even respondents who said that they 
prefer to use cashless payment options to pay 
for their day- to- day expenditure carry an aver -
age of €77 in cash around with them.2 Only 
4% of citizens do not carry any cash. Those sur -
veyed even hold significantly higher amounts 
of cash as a reserve at home.3
Most cash is still obtained at ATMs4 and bank 
counters. These traditional points of access to 
cash are used for 92% of all withdrawals, by 
value, of which 81% alone are made at ATMs 
(see the chart below). With a share of 11% of 
withdrawals in value terms, bank counters are 
the second most important source of cash. The 
cash infrastructure operated by credit institu -
tions thus plays a key role in the supply of cash 
to the German population. Credit institutions 
hold cash in order to supply their customers. However, monetary policy developments have 
resulted in additional one- off effects on credit 
institutions’ cash holdings, which are explained 
in greater detail in the box on pp. 96 f.
For some years, however, we have been seeing 
a decline in bank- based cash infrastructure. It is 
particularly striking how the branch network 
has been thinned out (see the chart on p. 95). 
The number of bank branches has declined by 
almost 19,000 since 2007, from around 42,000 
bank branches back then to in the region of 
23,000 in 2021. By contrast, the number of 
ATMs remained virtually constant for a long 
time and has declined slightly since 2018. Since 
then, operators have taken around 3,500 ATMs 
out of service. This development raises ques -
tions about access to cash in Germany: what is 
the current situation regarding the availability 
of cash withdrawal facilities? And what risks 
could arise for the cash supply in the future if 
credit institutions significantly pare back their 
cash withdrawal services?
In addition to traditional sources of cash, citi -
zens can also obtain cash at selected points of 
sale.5 Consumers are increasingly taking up this 
option (see the adjecent chart). Whilst only 2% 
of all cash withdrawals in value terms were 
made at a point of sale in 2017, this share 
stood at 8% in 2021.6 Against this backdrop, 
the question is to what extent these alternative Cash widely

4 ATMs are either pure cash dispensers or customer-  
operated cash recycling machines, which allow both cash 
withdrawals and cash deposits.
5 Cash transactions at the point of sale can be carried out 
via cashback and/  or cash-  in- shop procedures. In a cash -
back transaction, cash is withdrawn during the process of 
paying at the cash register. Cash- in- shop services allow cus -
tomers to both withdraw and deposit cash. This does not 
require a purchase as the transaction formally constitutes 
an activity outsourced by the withdrawing party’s credit in -
stitution.

sources of cash can, in the future, complement 
traditional banking industry services.
In the light of the developments outlined 
above, this article looks at the spatial availabil -
ity of withdrawal facilities in Germany. What 
does a possible decline in bank- based infra -
structure mean in terms of access to cash? And 
what role can alternative point- of- sale cash 
withdrawal options play in the future?
Dataset for the analyses
The analyses use geographical data on the lo -
cations of ATMs, bank branches and points of 
sale offering cash services. Credit institutions 
and other cash handlers directly supplied the 
majority of the geographical data for the refer -
ence year 2021. If only the postal address was 
available for a point of access to cash, geoco -
ding was used to translate it into coordinates.7 
Further geographical data for bank branches 
and ATMs as well as for points of sale allowing 
cash withdrawals were obtained from Open -
StreetMap8 and from the Federal Agency for 
Cartography and Geodesy. The data on munici -
palities’ population size and surface area and 
other geodata were likewise supplied by the 
Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy.9
For the purposes of the following analyses, the 
various cash withdrawal options supplied by 
one provider at the same site (for example, sev -
eral ATMs at one location or bank counters 
within a branch) are treated as one cash with -
drawal point. A supermarket with several cash 
registers and thus withdrawal options is also 
treated as a single cash source. The analyses do 
not, therefore, provide any information on the 
number of ATMs, bank counters or cash regis -
ters allowing cash withdrawals that are avail -
able at a cash access point. Instead, the follow -
ing analyses focus on the spatial availability of 
cash withdrawal facilities.Cash withdrawal facilities 
within municipalities
In 2021, citizens were able to withdraw cash at 
a total of 77,669 different facilities throughout 
Germany. 49,874 cash withdrawal facilities 
were traditional sources of cash such as bank 
branches and ATMs. Alternative cash with -
drawal options at the point of sale constituted 
around 36% of all cash withdrawal facilities, or 
27,795 in total. In purely arithmetical terms, in -
dividuals thus had at their disposal around nine

Developments in the cash holdings of monetary fi  nancial 
institutions in Germany
Credit institutions hold cash primarily so 
that they can supply their customers with 
banknotes and coins. Individuals withdraw 
this money at cash dispensers (ATMs) or 
bank counters for consumption purposes or 
to store as a cash reserve. The retail trade, 
meanwhile, mainly needs coins and low- 
value banknote denominations that can be 
used as change. At the end of the chain, it 
is the job of credit institutions to cover this 
demand. This makes them an important 
part of the German cash cycle.1
Holding cash entails costs for credit institu-
tions, meaning they generally strive to keep 
their holdings to a minimum for economic 
reasons. The associated costs include direct 
costs arising, for example, from transport 
and storage as well as the insurance of cash 
against involuntary loss. In addition, hold-
ing cash gives rise to opportunity costs, 
since the physically tied- up capital cannot 
be invested in other, possibly more profi  t-
able, forms of investment. From a liquidity 
perspective, too, cash holdings tend to be a 
less attractive option for credit institutions 
than keeping deposits on an account with a 
central bank.
However, the period from 2016 onwards 
saw notable one- off developments in the 
statistically recorded cash holdings of mon-
etary fi  nancial institutions (MFIs) in Ger-
many, around the time the Eurosystem 
began pursuing an exceedingly low interest 
rate policy.2 Seasonal fl  uctuations aside, 
cash holdings were largely within a range of 
€13 billion to €16 billion at the end of 2015 
(see the chart entitled “Cash holdings of 
monetary fi  nancial institutions in Germany” 
on p.  97).3 It can be assumed that these amounts were what credit institutions held 
to satisfy regular customer demand.
Cash holdings rose signifi  cantly, albeit ir-
regularly from the start of 2016. At the end 
of 2016, they were already signifi  cantly 
higher than they had been at the same 
point in the previous year, amounting to 
€26.0 billion. By the end of 2019, cash 
holdings had risen to a total of €43.4 billion 
and, in March 2020, reached €48.1 billion, 
going on to hold broadly steady around 
that level over the next two years.4 At the 
end of June 2022, cash holdings hit their 
highest level so far – €51.8 billion – before 
falling signifi  cantly in the following months. 
While the total amount of cash held by 
MFIs in Germany had already dropped 
down to €42.3 billion at the end of July, it 
declined by €18.7 billion in August, by €2.9 
billion in September and by €0.7 billion in 
the following month. At €20.0 billion, cash 
holdings at the end of October 2022 were 
thus much closer to the level recorded in 
2015.
1 For a description of the German cash cycle, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2011).
2 Besides credit institutions, monetary fi  nancial institu-
tions also include money market funds, which gener-
ally do not hold cash. In addition to euro cash, cash 
holdings also cover cash in other currencies as well as 
postage stamps and court fee stamps. Given that the 
total value of these is negligible, they are not taken 
into account separately. For a look at developments in 
credit institutions’ cash holdings, see Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2018).
3 Seasonal fl  uctuations include, in particular, a regu-
larly occurring increase at the end of the year, stem-
ming from consumers’ cash spending in connection 
with Christmas trading.
4 In March 2020, cash holdings of MFIs saw a net in-
crease of €7.9 billion. This growth in cash holdings is 
likely to have been driven in part by precautionary mo-
tives related to the coronavirus pandemic.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
January 2023

Looking at the fi  gures for banknote lodge-
ments at the Bundesbank in 2022 (see the 
lower chart on this page), it can be seen 
that they started going up signifi  cantly in 
July, from calendar week 28 onwards. This 
increase is almost entirely attributable to 
substantial lodgements of €500 and €200 
banknotes. In terms of value, the amounts 
being paid in remained at a discernibly ele-
vated level until the end of August (calen-
dar week 34/ 35), before moving towards 
the previous year’s level over the following 
period. Even so, up to the end of October 
(calendar week 43), lodgements remained 
slightly higher than the corresponding fi  g-
ures for the previous year. One aspect 
worthy of note is the exceptionally high 
share of fi  rst series €200 banknotes at 
times; these accounted for more than half 
of the lodgements of €200 banknotes in 
some calendar weeks.
Overall, the observations suggest that the 
evolution of MFIs’ cash holdings in Ger-
many since 2016 has been heavily infl  u-
enced by one- off monetary policy effects. 
The sharp rise in the cash holdings recorded 
in the statistics is likely to be the result of 
credit institutions shifting some liquid funds 
away from the negatively remunerated de-
posit facility into banknotes as a way of 
avoiding negative interest rates.5 As interest 
rates started to turn around, the additional 
holdings then quickly fl  owed back to the 
Bundesbank.
Now that the European Central Bank’s 
interest rate on the deposit facility is back in 
positive territory, the economic motives for 
keeping additional cash holdings to avoid 
negative interest rates no longer apply; this 
means that the phenomenon of the strong 
expansion in cash holdings on the part of 
credit institutions has probably come to an 
end. Instead, it is to be expected that the 
demand for cash stemming from credit in-stitutions’ customer base will resume its 
position as a key factor determining the 
maintenance of cash holdings by MFIs.

ants: six traditional and roughly three alterna -
tive options.
The chart above provides an overview of the 
geographical distribution of traditional and al -
ternative cash withdrawal facilities in Germany. 
A striking feature is that traditional and alterna -
tive withdrawal facilities tend to be located to -
gether (see also the chart on p. 100). For ex -
ample, most locations host both traditional 
(ATM: dark blue circle, bank counter: light blue 
dot) and alternative (black cross) cash with -
drawal facilities. In addition, there are regions 
with a cluster of cash withdrawal facilities, 
while the network of cash points is sparser in 
other regions. There is a dense network of cash 
withdrawal facilities particularly in the west and 
south of Germany and in conurbations, while 
fewer cash withdrawal facilities are available in 
the east of Germany.
Looking at the availability of traditional and al -
ternative cash withdrawal facilities at the muni -cipal level, the 11,007 German municipalities10 
can be divided into four groups based on the 
quality of the provision of cash withdrawal fa -
cilities: first, municipalities in which there is at 
least one traditional and at least one alternative 
cash withdrawal facility; second, municipalities 
with only traditional withdrawal facilities; third, 
municipalities with only alternative cash with -
drawal facilities; and, fourth, municipalities 
with neither option for accessing cash. As can 
be seen in the table and in the chart on p. 99, 
4,686 municipalities in Germany have no cash 
withdrawal facilities. These municipalities are 
home to around 3.1 million people, or 3.7% of 
the total population.11
However, most citizens have at their disposal a 
point of access to cash in their home munici -
pality. 96% of Germany’s total population, 
namely 79.8 million citizens, have traditional 
cash withdrawal facilities within their munici -
pality. Around 76.3 million citizens, or 91.8% of 
the total population, do not need to leave their 
municipality to make a point- of- sale cash with -
drawal. These results suggest that access to 
cash in Germany is currently good despite a 
number of municipalities having no cash with -
drawal facilities.
A total of 76.1 million citizens, or 91.5% of Ger -
many’s population, and thus by far the largest 
group of the population, live in municipalities 
with at least one traditional as well as one al -
ternative cash withdrawal facility. Among the 
municipalities with just one source of cash, mu -
nicipalities with at least one traditional cash 
withdrawal facility predominate. This constella -
tion applies to 1,779 municipalities, which are 
home to 3.7 million people. The municipalities 
in question are primarily located in the south of 
Germany. Only a small proportion of the total 
population, namely 0.3%, lives in municipalities 
in which there is the option of withdrawing 
cash at a point of sale, but not at a bank coun -3.1 million

ter or an ATM. With just a few exceptions, 
these municipalities are located in the eastern 
federal states. Taken together, the point of sale 
therefore generally complements the banking 
industry’s existing cash services and is only very 
rarely the sole source of cash within a munici -
pality.
As shown in the chart on p. 100, the number 
of cash withdrawal facilities available within a 
municipality is positively correlated with its re -
spective number of inhabitants. One logical ex -
planation for this strong correlation is the 
higher demand for cash – and thus for points 
of access to cash – associated with a higher 
number of inhabitants. The characteristics of 
municipalities with and without cash with -
drawal facilities are compared in the box on 
p. 101.
Furthermore, there is a positive correlation be -
tween the number of traditional and alterna -
tive cash withdrawal facilities within a munici -
pality (see the chart on p. 100). This confirms 
the impression expressed above that alternative 
withdrawal sources complement the cash with -
drawal infrastructure provided by credit institu -
tions.
In that sense, points of sale do not represent 
any kind of substitute for ATMs and bank coun -ters either, especially given the prominent pos -
ition occupied by the bank- based cash infra -
structure in the cash cycle. For instance, the 
bulk of withdrawals effected at the point of 
sale – much like change – do not have to be 
checked for quality beforehand. As a result,

money that is no longer fit for circulation can 
continue to pass between consumers and re -
tailers without being withdrawn from circula -
tion. By contrast, credit institutions can and 
must make a proper check of the quality and 
authenticity of banknotes and coins. Their 
heavy involvement in the cash cycle therefore 
remains essential. The same applies to the cen -
tral bank: it is able to carry out a particularly re -
liable authenticity check and it permanently re -
moves banknotes that are no longer fit for cir -
culation from the cycle by destroying them. At 
the same time, the central bank provides 
“fresh” cash that is brought into the cycle first 
and foremost via the banking industry – be it through the provision of change to retailers or 
directly to consumers in the form of withdraw -
als.12
Distance to the nearest 
source of cash withdrawals
It seems most citizens live in municipalities with 
a good amount of available cash sources. How -
ever, the distance to the nearest source of cash 
withdrawals is also important, as this is likely to 
be closely related to the effort individuals per -
ceive to be involved in withdrawing cash. For 
the following analysis, the distances between 
the centre of a municipality and the nearest 
source of cash withdrawals are therefore evalu -
ated. The distance is the length of the straight 
line between the centre of an inhabited muni -
cipality and a source of cash withdrawals – in 
other words, the route “as the crow flies”.13 Al-
though this means that the results presented 
below underestimate the actual effort involved 
in accessing cash, they nevertheless serve as a 
useful guide, especially when comparing vari -
ous sub- groups.14Number of cash sources in municipalities

12 The average withdrawal amount at bank counters is 
€736 per use, while an average of €230 and €94, respect -
ively, is obtained per withdrawal at ATMs and at the point 
of sale; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a). Cash withdraw -
als are generally subject to a withdrawal limit that is higher 
for withdrawals at traditional cash sources than at alterna -
tive points of access to cash. For a description of the cash 
cycle in Germany, see Beermann (2022) and Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2011).
13 Calculating distances “as the crow flies” is a commonly 
used approach in the literature on access to cash; see Re -
strepo (2021), Caddy and Zhang (2021), Tischer et al. 
(2020) and European Central Bank (2022). An alternative 
and more accurate – but much more complex – approach 
is to calculate the distance taking into account the trans -
port network. See Stix (2020), Trütsch (2022) and Banque 
de France (2019). However, Stix (2020) and contributions 
from other fields of research show that calculating dis -
tances as the crow flies provides a very good approxima -
tion of the actual distance resulting from taking into ac -
count the transport network – see Boscoe et al. (2012).
14 First, calculating the distance as a straight line leads to 
the actual distance that has to be travelled to reach the 
source of cash withdrawals being underestimated. Second, 
it is implicitly assumed that the homes of all inhabitants of 
a municipality are concentrated in the centre of the muni -
cipality and are not distributed more broadly or located on 
the outskirts. This overestimates the actual spatial proxim -
ity of citizens to the sources of cash withdrawals.Deutsche Bundesbank

Characteristics of municipalities with and without a cash 
withdrawal facility
The table below shows selected differences 
between municipalities with cash withdrawal 
facilities and those without. As expected, resi-
dents of municipalities without their own 
source of cash have to travel considerably 
longer distances to get to the nearest cash 
withdrawal facility. While residents of munici-
palities with a cash withdrawal facility have to 
travel roughly 0.2 km on average to the near-
est cash withdrawal facility, those living in mu-
nicipalities without a cash withdrawal facility 
must travel an average of 3.6 km to reach 
their nearest source of cash. A comparison of 
the distances to be travelled to the different 
cash withdrawal facilities shows that the resi-
dents of municipalities without a cash with-
drawal facility have to travel an average of 
4.2 km to the nearest bank counter and an 
average of 3.8 km to the nearest ATM. The 
nearest point- of- sale cash withdrawal point is 
an average of 4.6 km away. By contrast, the 
residents of municipalities with a cash with-
drawal facility have to travel 0.7 km on aver-
age to reach their nearest bank counter and 
0.3 km to the nearest ATM. The distance to 
the nearest point of sale offering cash services 
is 1.7 km, on average.1
In addition, municipalities without a cash 
withdrawal facility have fewer inhabitants and 
are, at the same time, more sparsely popu-
lated. On average, the 6,321 municipalities 
with a cash withdrawal facility are each home 
to 12,665 people. By contrast, the 4,478 mu-
nicipalities without a cash withdrawal facility 
have roughly 694 inhabitants, on average. Municipalities with a cash withdrawal facility 
are therefore, on average, home to 18 times 
more residents than municipalities without a 
cash withdrawal facility. In average terms, mu-
nicipalities with a cash withdrawal facility are 
roughly four times as densely populated as 
municipalities with no option for withdrawing 
cash and thus have a signifi  cantly larger sur-
face area.
1 These data are computed by fi  rst calculating the dis-
tance from the centre of the municipality to the near-
est bank counter, ATM and point of sale for each mu-
nicipality. The nearest cash withdrawal facility is de-
fi  ned as the one where this distance is shortest. Subse-
quently, means are formed for the two groups, namely 
municipalities with and those without cash withdrawal 
facilities. As the mean distance to the nearest cash 
withdrawal facility takes into account all the different 
types of withdrawal sources, it is necessarily shorter 
than the mean distance obtained by looking at the 
bank branches, ATMs and points of sale separately.Characteristics of municipalities

Citizens have to travel an average of 1.6 km to 
get to their nearest cash withdrawal facility. For 
79.3 million citizens, their nearest source of 
cash withdrawals of any kind is no further than 
1 km away from the centre of their municipal -
ity. This corresponds to 95.4% of the entire population in Germany. 3.3 million citizens 
have to travel more than 1 km, but no further 
than 5 km to reach their nearest source of cash 
withdrawals. The nearest cash withdrawal 
source is located between 5 km and 10 km 
away for 0.6 million citizens. No municipality’s 
nearest withdrawal facility is further than 15 km 
away from its centre – regardless of whether 
the municipality itself has a cash withdrawal 
source or not (see the table above).15
ATMs are usually the geographically closest 
withdrawal option for most inhabitants. 
Around 78.8 million citizens have to travel no 
further than 1 km to get to their nearest ATM. 
Bank counters are accessible within a 1 km ra -
dius for 77.5 million inhabitants. Roughly 74 
million citizens have to travel no further than 
1 km to be able to carry out cash transactions 
at their nearest point of sale. There are no 
cases where the nearest ATM is located more 
than 15 km from the centre of a municipality.

15 The nearest is not necessarily the best source of cash 
withdrawals for citizens; for instance, say the nearest trad -
itional cash withdrawal source is operated by a credit insti -
tution belonging to a different group than the credit insti -
tution that the individual banks with. In this case, the sav -
ing in distance may not offset any additional costs that 
might be incurred as a result of using the cash withdrawal 
source. Or if the withdrawal facility in mind is not the near -
est, but is located on a route they travel in their day- to- day 
lives anyway.Deutsche Bundesbank

Availability of alternative options
ATMs and bank counters are by far the 
most important source of cash. If the near-
est traditional cash withdrawal facility were 
to close, how much further would people 
have to travel to ﬁ  nd a facility? In order to 
assess the availability and reachability of 
alternatives  to traditional cash withdrawal 
facilities, the analysis below is limited to 
municipalities in which a bank counter or 
ATM is the nearest source of cash. This con-
stellation applies to 8,087 municipalities 
that are home to a total of 64.3 million 
people, corresponding to a population 
share of 77.3%. It thus covers more than 
three- quarters of the total population of 
Germany. The additional distance to the 
second- nearest cash withdrawal facility is 
then calculated for these municipalities.
On average, people in these municipalities 
must travel an additional 0.8 km in order to 
withdraw cash at an alternative facility (see 
the table below).1 As traditional and alter-
native cash withdrawal facilities can differ 
considerably in the range of services offered 
(e.g. opening hours, maximum withdrawal 
amounts, available denominations), it is ap-
propriate to take a differentiated view and 
examine each type of alternative option. In 
order to reach alternative bank counters 
and ATMs, people must travel an additional 
1 km on average. This corresponds to an 
extension of the distance to be travelled by 
72.8%. On average, points of sale offering 
cash services are more than twice as far 
away; people have to cover an extra 1.6 km 
to compensate for the loss of a traditional cash source by travelling to an appropriate 
point of sale.
These observations once again underline 
the central importance of bank- based infra-
structure for the supply of cash in Germany. 
Moreover, the results suggest that, despite 
the current good supply situation in Ger-
many, an erosion of the cash infrastructure 
represented by the closure of an increasing 
number of withdrawal facilities would likely 
signiﬁ  cantly increase the time and effort in-
volved in obtaining cash.
1 This statement only refers to the additional distance 
to be travelled in order to reach the alternative facility. 
The time and effort may be greater if the nearest alter-
native facility charges for obtaining cash and the client 
therefore chooses to make a signiﬁ  cantly longer jour-
ney to reach a withdrawal facility where cash can be 
withdrawn free of charge.Nearest alternative to traditional

than 15 km to be able to obtain cash at their 
nearest bank counter and 3,932 have further 
than 15 km to go to reach the closest point of 
sale offering cash services.
The fact that bank counters or ATMs are the 
nearest source of cash withdrawals for 64.3 
million citizens –  77.3% of the total popula -
tion – highlights the importance of the bank-  
based cash infrastructure for access to cash in 
Germany. Points of sale offering cash services, 
meanwhile, are the geographically closest cash 
withdrawal option for 18.9 million inhabitants. 
An average of 1.8 km has to be travelled to 
reach the nearest ATM. The nearest bank coun -
ter is 2.1 km away on average.16 Meanwhile, 
the average distance to the nearest point of 
sale is 2.9 km across all inhabited municipal -
ities, as indicated in the table on p. 102.
Good access to cash in Germany is therefore 
guaranteed overall. This result is also confirmed 
by public surveys, which reveal citizens con -
sider the existing infrastructure of points of ac -
cess to cash to be good. Overall, 93% of re -
spondents find it fairly easy or very easy to get 
to an ATM or bank counter. In most cases, they 
combine going to a bank- based cash source 
with going shopping (47%) or to work (17%). 
15% of respondents make a separate trip to an 
ATM or bank counter from home. Respondents 
take an average of nine minutes to withdraw 
cash.17
A dense network of cash withdrawal points 
helps to ensure that citizens can freely choose 
their preferred means of payment. It also makes 
the supply and removal of cash easier, contrib -
uting to an efficient cash cycle. However, the 
reduction of bank branches and ATMs over the 
past few years in particular has heightened 
fears that access to cash could deteriorate in 
future. Such developments pose the risk of a 
self- reinforcing downward spiral. Surveys con -
ducted by the Bundesbank reveal that 13% of 
respondents would use less cash if their time 
spent travelling to a cash withdrawal facility 
were to increase by five minutes. If respond -ents needed 15 minutes longer to reach a cash 
withdrawal facility, 20% of them would use 
cash less frequently as a means of payment.18 
The decline in the use of cash in turn heightens 
the pressure on the existing bank-  based cash 
infrastructure, meaning that a further stripping 
away of ATMs and bank counters could have a 
self- reinforcing effect. It is therefore important 
that credit institutions continue to operate an 
appropriate number of cash withdrawal facil -
ities and thus continue to fulfil their responsibil -
ity to supply the population with cash. This will 
ensure that euro banknotes and coins also al -
ways remain available as a means of payment 
and store of value in future and can be ob -
tained without requiring a greater amount of 
effort.19 The box on p. 103 looks at how clos -
ures of cash withdrawal facilities might affect 
the cash supply.
Summary
Cash has a special role in society. It is the most 
commonly used means of payment in Germany 
and is also in demand as a store of value. Cash 
protects privacy since, unlike with digital means 
of payment, no personal data are collected 
when transactions are conducted. It safeguards 
financial inclusion of all groups in society and 
might be the only means of payment that is 
available at short notice and viable for use in an 
emergency or crisis situation.
In order to obtain cash, the overwhelming ma -
jority of citizens use traditional sources of cash 
withdrawals, such as bank counters and ATMs. 
At the same time, the bank- based cash infra -
structure is in a state of change. The reduction 
of ATMs and bank counters that we are seeing Public surveys 
confirm good 
access to cash 
in Germany
Paring back of 
bank- based cash 
infrastructure 
harbours the risk 
of a self- 
reinforcing 
downward 
spiral …
… that ends up 
placing the 
availability and 
use of cash at 
stake16 Taken together, the nearest traditional withdrawal facil -
ity is located 1.7 km away from the centre of a municipal -
ity on average.

harbours the risk that the existing network of 
cash withdrawal sources will develop cracks 
and it will become more difficult to supply citi -
zens with cash via bank- based cash infrastruc -
ture. In this context, the remarks in this article 
also demonstrate that the point of sale can 
complement the banking industry’s cash supply 
services, but cannot replace them.
The analysis of information on the locations of 
withdrawal facilities shows that, together, trad -
itional and alternative withdrawal sources cur -
rently make up a dense network of cash with -
drawal options. It is therefore easily possible to 
access cash in Germany at present. At the same 
time, there are already a number of municipal -
ities in Germany that do not have any option for withdrawing cash within their boundaries. 
The 3.1 million citizens who this affects have to 
travel considerably further to obtain cash, 
which may involve a greater amount of effort 
to access cash and can influence the choice of 
their preferred means of payment.
However, citizens should always be free to de -
cide how they want to pay. As part of its cash 
strategy, the Eurosystem aims to ensure that 
euro banknotes and coins will continue to be 
available and generally accepted as a means of 
payment and store of value in the future. This 
also includes providing the general public with 
cash via an adequate supply of cash withdrawal 
sources. The Bundesbank will thus continue to 
closely monitor access to cash in Germany.

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the

accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,
Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from
2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from
2015 including Lithuania) as well as Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  5 Euro area countries (current
composition) and countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners
(fixed comosition).  6 Euro area countries (current composition) and countries belonging
to the broad EER group of trading partners (fixed composition).
