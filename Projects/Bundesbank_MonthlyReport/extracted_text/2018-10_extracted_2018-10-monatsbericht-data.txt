Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Although the economic upswing in Germany is 
essentially still intact, it may have come to a 
temporary halt in the third quarter of 2018. 
This was probably due to considerable difficul -
ties in the automotive sector in certifying 
vehicles  according to a new emission test pro -
cedure, the WLTP (Worldwide harmonized 
Light vehicles Test Procedure). The associated 
temporary production losses severely damp -
ened industrial output. In addition, the boom -
ing construction sector is expected to slow 
down after the strong growth in the second 
quarter. According to the information available 
to date, retail sales were also relatively sub -
dued. However, the pause in growth is unlikely 
to continue for very long and the difficulties in 
the automotive sector should soon be over. 
This is indicated by the business expectations in 
this sector, which again rose significantly of 
late. According to the ifo Institute, the business 
climate in Germany also brightened noticeably 
in the third quarter as a whole, which means 
that a significant expansion in economic out -
put is to be expected in the current three-  
month period.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in August 
2018 largely remained at the low level of the 
previous month. It therefore decreased strongly 
on an average of July and August compared 
with the second quarter (-1½%). The main rea -
son for this was a very significant drop in out -
put in the automotive sector (-9%). This is 
probably due to ongoing difficulties with the 
certification of model variants in connection 
with the new WLTP measuring procedure for 
exhaust emissions, which has been mandatory 
since September for all first- time registrations of passenger cars and light- duty commercial 
vehicles. According to the data of the German 
Association of the Automotive Industry already 
available for September on the number of 
manufactured motor vehicles, these problems 
persisted up until the end of the quarter. Ex -
cluding the automotive sector, however, indus -
trial output on an average of July and August 
remained at the level of the previous quarter, 
although other sectors were also affected by 
the slump in the automotive sector via supply 
chains. Producers of intermediate goods, for 
example, reported significant production cut -
backs (-1¼%). Although the production of cap -
ital goods declined at an above- average rate 
on the whole (-2¾%), strong growth was still 
recorded if the automotive sector is excluded 
(+1½%). Production in the consumer goods 
sector rose significantly (+¾%), with the pro -
duction of pharmaceutical products, in particu -
lar, continuing to soar (+6%).
Seasonally adjusted new orders in German in -
dustry rose sharply in August 2018 on the 
month (+2%). On an average of July and 
August , industrial firms received considerably 
fewer new orders than in the second quarter 
(-1¾%). This was due primarily to the weak 
demand  for German products from abroad. 
The inflow of new orders from non-  euro area 
countries fell substantially (-2½%). New orders 
from other euro area countries dropped even 
more sharply (-4¼%). The automotive sector in 
particular saw a slump in demand (-9¾%). 
This, too, is probably attributable to the certifi -
cation problems in connection with the WLTP 
standard. By contrast, industrial enterprises re -
ceived noticeably more new orders from Ger -
man customers (+½%). However, the rather 
irregular   inflow of large orders from manufac -
turers of other transport equipment was the 
decisive factor behind the increase. Excluding 
these, domestic orders would also have been 
significantly lower (-1%). Although the overall 
inflow of new orders has been tending to de -German eco -

cline for quite some time now, the order situ -
ation of German enterprises is probably still 
favour  able. This is indicated, amongst other 
things, by the order backlog, which up until 
August was still pointing upwards.
Seasonally adjusted industrial sales in August 
2018 rose perceptibly on the month (+½%). 
Taking July and August together, however, they 
fell significantly short of the average of the 
spring months at 1%. This development took 
its cue from weak industrial production, driven 
mainly by the sharp slump in sales in the auto -
motive sector, which was, moreover, broadly 
based in regional terms. Overall sales conse -
quently declined in all major economic regions 
and, broken down by sector, among capital 
goods manufacturers in particular. By contrast, 
sales of intermediate goods declined only 
slightly and consumer goods sales stagnated at 
the prior- quarter level. In August 2018, season -
ally adjusted nominal exports of goods re -
mained at the level of the previous month. On 
an average of July and August, they fell slightly 
on the previous quarter (-¼%). Exports fell 
more sharply in real terms, however (-1%). The 
difficulties in the automotive sector probably 
played a role here, too. Nominal imports of 
goods receded sharply in August 2018 com -
pared with the previous month (-2¾%). Taking 
the average of July and August, however, im -
ports increased considerably compared with 
the second quarter (+2¾%). Even after adjust -
ment for price effects, the increase was still 
strong (+1¾%).
Construction
Construction output in August 2018 declined 
sharply (-1¾%) on the month in seasonally 
adjusted   terms. On an average of July and 
August , it saw scarcely any change compared 
with the strong second- quarter figures. A sub -
stantial increase in activity in the finishing 
trades (+1¼%) compensated for the sharp de -
cline in output in the main construction sector 
(-1½%). At the same time, the intake of new Industrial sales

orders in the main construction sector in July 
– figures are available up to then – was notice -
ably higher than in the second quarter (+½%). 
The fact that the construction boom in Ger -
many is continuing is also indicated by the as -
sessment of the business situation in the main 
construction sector, where, according to the ifo 
Institute, new record highs were achieved mul -
tiple times in the third quarter.
Labour market
The seasonally adjusted number of persons in 
employment increased comparatively moder -
ately in August. The total number of persons in 
work in Germany rose by 31,000 on the month. 
Compared with August 2017, the number of 
employed persons went up by 565,000, or 
1.3%. This is primarily due to the ongoing 
sharp increase in the number of jobs subject to 
social security contributions, which rose much 
more strongly (by 704,000 persons, or 2.2%) 
year on year than total employment. By con -
trast, there was a substantial contraction in the 
low- paid part- time employment segment and 
in the number of self- employed persons. The 
willingness of enterprises to recruit new staff 
appears set to stay at a high level in the coming 
months. Despite a slight decline, the ifo em -
ployment barometer remains at an exception -
ally high level. The Federal Employment Agen -
cy’s BA-  X job index has even climbed to a new 
record high.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment declined 
more sharply in September than in the summer 
months. There were 2.30 million persons regis -
tered as unemployed with the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, 23,000 fewer than in the previ -
ous month. The unemployment rate dropped 
by 0.1 percentage point to 5.1%. The number 
of unemployed persons fell by 192,000 on the 
year. The rather sharp decrease in unemploy -
ment in September could also be attributable 
in part to the expansion of labour market policy 
measures at the end of the summer holiday 
period. This is consistent with the fact that overall underemployment fell somewhat less 
strongly than registered unemployment. The 
heads of the regional employment agencies, 
who are surveyed by the Institute for Employ -
ment Research on the future development of 
unemployment, are somewhat more optimistic 
for the coming months than they were re -
cently, with the result that registered unemploy -
ment could continue to decline for the time 
being.
Prices
Crude oil prices rose noticeably against the 
backdrop of possible production losses and 
robust  global demand. They went up by just 
under 8% compared with August and ex -
ceeded the previous year’s level by almost 
43%. In the first half of October, prices were 
again markedly above the average of the previ -
ous month. As this report went to press, the 
price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at 
US$79. The discount on crude oil futures was 
around US$1 for deliveries six months ahead 
and US$2¾ for deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices picked up in August. While en -
ergy did not become more expensive, prices for 
other goods went up slightly. In the case of 
commercial producer prices, however, both en -
ergy and other goods grew more expensive. 
The year- on- year rate of increase remained at 
just under 5% in the case of imports and ex -
panded to 3.1% in the case of producer prices.
Consumer prices (HICP) rose substantially in 
September by a seasonally adjusted 0.5%. 
Energy  prices went up again perceptibly as a 
result of the higher crude oil and food prices. 
The prices of industrial goods excluding energy 
also increased noticeably, as they did in the 
previous month. Services also became signifi -
cantly more expensive again after the discon -
tinuation of charges for day care facilities for 
small children in a number of federal states had 
shortly before dampened the upward pressure 
on service prices. Rents continued to rise mod -Growth in

erately. Consumer prices advanced by a total of 
2.2% year on year, compared with 1.9% in 
August  (CPI 2.3%, after 2.0%). Inflation exclud -
ing energy and food went up from 1.1% to 
1.2%. From today’s perspective, headline rates 
of over 2% can be expected in the coming 
months.
Public finances1
Local government finances
Local government finances saw a slight year-  
on- year improvement in the second quarter of 
2018. The surplus posted by the core budgets 
and off- budget entities rose to €6 billion. Rev -
enue grew strongly overall, by 5½%, with tax 
receipts continuing to increase dynamically 
(4½%). This was particularly true of shares in 
income tax and VAT. In the case of VAT, local 
government’s effective revenue share increased 
due to a transfer from central government. 
(Net) income from local business tax grew only 
moderately. Growth was also recorded for 
transfers from public administrations (5½%) 
and, in particular, receipts from fees (7½%). 
The latter indicates that additional entities were 
once again added to the reporting group.
Expenditure grew at an only marginally lower 
rate than revenue. The largest expenditure cat -
egory, staff costs, saw a renewed rise of 4%. 
The even stronger increase in other operating 
expenditure (6%) could, like the growth in fee 
income, be connected with an expansion of 
the reporting group. Growth in spending on 
social benefits (3%) was dampened because of 
a significant decrease (25%) in benefits for asy -
lum seekers. Payments for the accommodation 
costs of unemployment benefit II recipients also 
declined (3%). However, spending on social as -
sistance (6%) and other social benefits rose 
steeply. In addition, fixed asset formation also 
increased strongly again in the second quarter 
(9%).At the end of the first half of the year, local 
government’s surplus of just over €½ billion 
was slightly higher than the previous year’s fig -
ure. For the year as a whole, another very high 
surplus is on the cards (2017: €11 billion), des -
pite the increase in expenditure. The medium- 
term outlook for local government budgets 
also appears  very bright overall. The expected 
macroeconomic environment remains positive. 
Furthermore, the Federal Cabinet also resolved 
to provide relief to state and local governments 
going beyond 2018 for the reception and inte -
gration of refugees. As in the preceding years, 
central government will also assume the costs 
of accommodating recognised asylum seekers 
in 2019. Beginning in 2020, local government 
will benefit from the additional revenue of state 
government thanks to the reform of the tax 
revenue- sharing scheme. In addition, the 
higher share of local business tax to be trans -
ferred to state government is set to lapse, 
which will provide considerable added relief to 
local governments in western Germany. In sum, 
it is likely that scope will be available for in -
creased investment and additional staff re -
quirements.
Local government debt decreased by €1 billion 
in mid-2018 as against the level at the end of 
March. Including liabilities to the public sector, 
the debt level thus came to just over €141 bil -
lion. Credit market debt remained virtually un -
changed at €93 billion, while cash advances 
dropped to just under €45 billion. The latter are 
actually intended simply to bridge liquidity 
shortfalls. The high levels of outstanding cash 
advances in Saarland, Rhineland- Palatinate, 
North Rhine-  Westphalia and Hesse over many 
years now point to structural budgetary imbal -
ances in numerous local governments, particu -
larly in those federal states. In some cases, 
these problems evidently still exist, even in the Slightly higher

wake of nationwide financial surpluses over 
multiple years. In order to tackle the issue, 
many state governments have already estab -
lished partial debt relief and consolidation pro -
grammes. The “Equivalent living conditions” 
commission since convened by the Federal 
Government is also set to draft related pro -
posals. The state of Hesse has set up a new 
special fund called “Hessenkasse”, which this 
year is pumping €5 billion into assuming al -
most all cash advances accrued by its local gov -
ernments. In return, the local governments in 
question pay a fixed annual amount towards 
the associated burdens over a period of up to 
30 years. Hesse has also implemented tighter 
budgetary rules designed to prevent local gov -
ernment slipping back towards non- temporary 
cash advances.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €106.4 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in August 2018 was slightly down 
on the figure for the previous month. After de -
ducting redemptions, which were considerably 
lower, and taking account of changes in is -
suers’ holdings of their own debt securities, the 
outstanding volume of domestic bonds rose by 
€10.9 billion, compared with a drop of €9.9 bil -
lion in July. The outstanding volume of foreign 
debt securities in the German bond market also 
increased by €5.4 billion.
In the reporting month, the public sector raised 
€12.1 billion net in the capital market. On bal -
ance, the greatest part of this was attributable 
to central government (€9.1 billion), which is -
sued predominantly ten- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds) totalling €4.6 billion, two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze) worth €4.3 billion and 
five- year Federal notes (Bobls) amounting to 
€3.0 billion. By contrast, it mainly redeemed 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills), with redemp -
tions totalling €3.6 billion on balance. State and local government increased their capital 
market debt by €3.0 billion net.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds total -
ling €2.6 billion net in August. On balance, 
there was mainly an increase in the outstand -
ing volume of other bank debt securities which 
can be structured flexibly (€3.6 billion), while 
mortgage Pfandbriefe also rose (€1.0 billion). 
Specialised credit institutions, meanwhile, re -
deemed debt securities to the tune of €1.4 bil -
lion net, while redemptions of public Pfand -
briefe totalled €0.5 billion net.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €3.9 billion in August, compared 
with net issuance of €3.6 billion in July. On bal -
ance, redemptions were almost exclusively 
long- term paper.
Foreign investors were the main net buyers in 
August, acquiring bonds for a net €10.8 billion.

billion worth of paper to its balance sheet, 
mainly under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase 
programmes. Domestic non- banks expanded 
their bond portfolios by €2.5 billion net, while 
domestic credit institutions divested themselves 
of bonds worth €1.6 billion net.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises placed €0.2 billion net worth of new 
shares in the German equity market, most of 
which emanated from non- listed companies. 
At the same time, the outstanding volume of 
foreign shares in the German market rose by 
€4.5 billion. Domestic non- banks were virtually 
the only buyers of equities on balance (€5.8 bil -
lion). Domestic credit institutions added shares 
totalling €0.5 billion net to their portfolios, 
while non- resident investors offloaded equities 
worth €1.5 billion net.Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€8.4 billion in August (€5.5 billion in July). Spe -
cialised funds reserved for institutional invest -
ors were the main beneficiaries of these in -
flows. Among the various asset classes, mixed 
securities funds were the chief sellers of shares 
in the market (€4.4 billion), while funds of 
funds (€1.9 billion), open- end real estate funds 
(€1.4 billion), equity funds (€1.3 billion), and 
bond funds (€1.1 billion) also recorded inflows. 
The outstanding volume of foreign mutual 
fund shares distributed in the German market 
decreased by €0.6 billion during the reporting 
month. German non- banks were virtually the 
sole net buyers of investment fund units (€8.0 
billion). Non- resident investors increased their 
German holdings by €0.1 billion on balance, 
while domestic credit institutions sold mutual 
fund shares to the tune of €0.2 billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €15.3 billion in August 2018, putting it €0.2 
billion above the level of the previous month. 
The surplus in the goods account fell slightly, 
while the deficit in invisible current transactions 
– which comprise the services account as well 
as primary and secondary income – narrowed 
to a somewhat greater extent by comparison.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account decreased by €0.3 billion on the 
month to €18.2 billion. Goods imports in for -
eign trade fell more sharply than goods ex -
ports. However, in net terms, this was more 
than offset by the decreased exports and in -
creased imports of supplementary trade items 
in particular.
In August, the deficit in invisible current trans -
actions narrowed by €0.5 billion to €2.9 billion. 
This was due to a rise in net receipts in primary 
income and a decline in net expenditure in sec -
ondary income, which outweighed the increase Little net

in the services account deficit. Net receipts on 
primary income grew by €0.9 billion to €6.5 
billion. This had much to do with the fact that 
expenditure on non- residents’ direct invest -
ment declined more sharply than residents’ 
corresponding receipts and that there was a 
reduc tion in expenditure for income from in -
vestment fund shares. In the secondary income 
account, the deficit narrowed by €0.9 billion to 
€3.8 billion, with lower payments from non-  
government sectors to non- residents playing a 
significant role. Conversely, the deficit in the 
services account grew by €1.3 billion to €5.6 
billion, largely on account of the usual seasonal 
increase in travel expenditure.
Against the backdrop of sharp drops in ex -
change rates and share prices in some emer -
ging market economies, cross- border portfolio 
investment in Germany recorded net capital 
imports of €0.6 billion in August, compared 
with net capital exports of €26.6 billion in July. 
Foreign investors purchased German securities 
in the amount of €9.2 billion net, adding €10.9 
billion of – mostly public sector – bonds to their 
portfolios and disposing of shares to the tune 
of €1.7 billion. During the same period, domes -
tic investors purchased foreign securities worth 
€8.5 billion. These encompassed bonds (€5.0 
billion), shares (€3.7 billion) and money market 
paper (€0.4 billion). At the same time, they dis -
posed of mutual fund shares to the amount of 
€0.6 billion.
In August, direct investment generated net 
capital exports totalling €2.9 billion, compared 
with net capital exports of €7.3 billion one 
month earlier. This was driven by German 
enter prises’ direct investment abroad, which 
amounted to €3.0 billion. They bolstered their 
equity capital (€8.6 billion) and scaled back 
intra- group lending (€5.6 billion), with foreign 
affiliates paying their existing trade credits back 
to their German parent companies in particular. 
At €0.1 billion, German enterprises received 
only limited net funds from abroad in the form 
of direct investment. In this context, they 
boosted their equity capital (€0.7 billion), while Inflows in

State government finances:  
comparison of developments, debt brakes 
and fiscal surveillance
German state government finances have improved considerably in the current decade. This has 
been driven mainly by strong growth in tax revenue and the extremely low interest rates. Almost 
all federal states (or Länder), including their local governments, achieved structural surpluses last 
year. Although there are still considerable differences, the various states’ financial situations have 
converged over time. By contrast, debt levels have continued to move in different directions and 
now exhibit a large spread. This is currently less of an issue given the very low level of interest 
rates, and further savings will initially probably be possible as debt is rolled over. However, the 
current low interest rate environment should not be regarded as permanent. A normalisation has 
a particularly strong impact when debt levels are high. Highly indebted federal states, in particu -
lar, would therefore be well advised to pursue an ambitious budgetary policy.
The federal states’ spending on civil servants’ pensions will increase considerably for some time 
to come. As things currently stand, existing reserves for civil servants’ pensions are not large 
enough to cover this. The size of both the financial burden and the provisions made differs from 
state to state. Hence, it would be desirable for all Länder to disclose details of both items regu -
larly at certain dates in a transparent and harmonised manner. As is being discussed for the 
statutory pension insurance system, it would make sense to also gradually raise the retirement 
age for civil servants in the future in line with rising life expectancy.
Central government will make a larger contribution to the state government revenue- sharing 
scheme from 2020. In addition, it is to co- finance state government tasks on a much larger scale. 
Whereas the states’ individual responsibility was strengthened in the last decade, responsibilities 
are now increasingly being blurred again. This would not appear to promote an efficient use of 
funds. What would, in fact, be important is a clear link between government tasks, spending and 
funding. By strengthening the responsibility of the individual state governments, it would also be 
easier to take account of different preferences in terms of the organisation and extent of govern -
ment activity. Increased freedom of scope regarding some taxes and transparent comparisons of 
public services and their cost would strengthen federalism.
From 2020, the debt brake will apply to all federal states. In terms of its concrete implementation, 
the individual states are pursuing different approaches. What matters is that the concrete rules 
successfully guarantee that the objective of the debt brake is met: to ensure that there are no 
permanent deficits in the future. Alongside the national fiscal rules, the European rules, which 
target the general government deficit, must also be met. Here, stringent and transparent fiscal 
surveillance is of central importance. In this, the Stability Council has a key role. However, the 
information based on which budgetary surveillance takes place does not currently appear 
adequate. Significant improvements are needed in terms of the scope, information value and 
comparability of the information provided by the individual federal states.Deutsche Bundesbank

Role of the federal states in 
the federal system
The federal states have a special role to play 
within the federal system. The state govern -
ments have a say in national law-  making 
through their representation in the Bundesrat. 
They are individually responsible for all areas 
not explicitly assigned to central government in 
Germany’s Basic Law (Grundgesetz).  This in -
cludes, in particular, primary, secondary and 
tertiary education, general internal security, 
general legal protection and important parts of 
the public administration, such as the tax of -
fices. The federal states are funded primarily 
through joint taxes raised uniformly at the na -
tional level, which they share with central gov -
ernment and (to a smaller extent) local govern -
ment. A revenue- sharing scheme is in place to 
avoid excessive differences in terms of the fi -
nancial capacities of the federal states and thus 
ultimately the public services they provide. Mu -
nicipal tasks are the responsibility of local gov -
ernment, and are, in part, funded by local gov -
ernment taxes to which local multipliers apply. 
Nonetheless, the federal states are partly re -
sponsible for ensuring that their local govern -
ments have adequate funding and pursue sus -
tainable fiscal policies.
The federal states’ individual responsibility has 
been strengthened over the past decade. Since 
the 2006 reform of the federal structure, for 
instance, the individual states have determined 
civil servants’ pay and the real estate acquisi -
tion tax rate, amongst others. In addition, 
mixed financing, where central government co- 
finances certain state government projects, 
was reduced significantly.1 This applies to the 
construction of social housing and of univer -
sities, say. The state governments are freer in 
terms of how they use the lump- sum payments 
they now receive. In addition, the debt brake 
was passed in 2009.
In recent years, the state governments’ individ -
ual responsibility in terms of resolving problems 
has taken something of a backseat, however. It is difficult, for instance, to make detailed com -
parisons of federal state outcomes, for example 
in education.2 In addition, plans to increase the 
scope of decision- making on tax legislation 
were not pursued – say through state- specific 
surcharges or discounts on income tax. Instead, 
the state governments have repeatedly sought 
additional central government funds to finance 
their tasks.3 In return, central government is 
demanding a greater say. Decisions are thus 
becoming increasingly centralised again and re -
sponsibilities are being blurred.
Development of state 
government  finances – 
an overview4
Looking at the federal states in aggregate, 
budgets were almost continuously in deficit 
from reunification to 2013. In 2003, a year of 
economic weakness, the deficit peaked at 
€34½ billion (1½% of gross domestic product 
(GDP)) (see the chart on p. 15). In 2007, a sur -
plus was achieved for the first time, partly as a 
result of the strong economy. However, the 
financial  and economic crisis then resulted in 
considerable deficits again. This was partly due 
to the economic downturn as well as, not least, 
spending on economic stimulus packages. 
After that, the situation improved gradually, 
however. Since 2014, surpluses have been re -
corded and climbed to €8½ billion by last year. Federal states 
have special

1 Ultimately, any central government involvement in 
schools was even banned.
2 As a case in point, when the Pisa surveys were con -
ducted, the state governments did not release more de -
tailed datasets on the state results for publication.
3 One result was, for instance, the Federal Government’s 
draft law intended to reform the Basic Law and expand 
mixed financing in education, in particular.
4 This overview is based on the national accounts. It in -
cludes not only core budgets, but also off- budget govern -
ment entities such as the federal states’ universities and 
construction agencies. By contrast, public enterprises such 
as university hospitals are not included in the government 
sector. The national accounts are better than the govern -
ment financial statistics at ensuring a consistent compari -
son over time. For more on trends in the federal states’ 
core budgets according to the government financial statis -
tics in the period 2005 to 2011, see Deutsche Bundesbank,

This was ultimately primarily due to strong tax 
growth and the falling interest burden. Even 
after cyclical adjustment, a surplus has been re -
corded since 2014.5 The fact that it has con -
tinued to rise in recent years is largely due to 
shrinking interest expenditure.
Spending trends
State governments account for just over one-  
third of spending by central, state and local 
government. In addition, they make large 
transfers to their local governments to help 
them fund the tasks conferred upon them. 
Since 2007, the year before the crisis, overall 
spending by the Länder has risen by 3½% a 
year on average (see the table on p. 16). The 
increase was therefore perceptibly more pro -
nounced than in the preceding decade and 
also as compared to nominal GDP growth of 
just over 2½% a year. Primary expenditure – in 
other words, excluding interest spending – ac -
tually increased by almost 4% on average. 
There was relatively strong growth in spending 
on, for instance, civil servants’ pensions, invest -
ment and intermediate consumption. In some 
instances, however, higher spending was also 
related to additional revenue already ear -
marked for this purpose. For example, there 
was a rise in the proportion of transfers to local 
government that were funded by central gov -
ernment. Additionally, television licence fees 
have, since 2013, been passed through the 
state government budgets for statistical pur -
poses.6 However, even excluding these two 
factors, primary expenditure still rose by a dis -
tinct 3½%.
Lower interest rates were a key factor in 
the  favour  able development in government 
finances  (see the chart on p. 17). This is evident, 
for example, when one compares the average 
interest rate on state government debt in 2017 
(2%) with the interest charged before the crisis. 
If the federal states had had to pay the average 
interest rate of 2007, namely just shy of 4½%, 
their interest expenditure would have been €13½ billion higher. Instead of a surplus, the 
Länder would have recorded a deficit of €5 bil -
lion last year. In actual fact, interest expend -
iture is less and less of a burden. Whereas inter -
est spending accounted for 7% of overall ex -
penditure in 2007, it represented a share of just 
3% at last count. In relation to GDP , this trans -
lates into a halving to just under ½%.
While average interest rates have been falling 
since as far back as 2008, debt initially con -
tinued to rise noticeably (as defined by the 
Maastricht Treaty, see the chart on p. 17). This 
was due both to the support provided to Lan -
desbanken during the financial crisis7 and to a 
spike in deficits. The state government debt Clear increase in

the individual taxes were allocated to the individual federal 
states based on their tax revenue shares.
6 In 2013, television licence fees were switched to a flat-  
rate fee per household. In the national accounts, they have 
since then been recorded as tax revenue of the federal 
states, which is transferred to the broadcasters on the ex -
penditure side.
7 Several institutions – in particular BayernLB (which re -
ceived €10 billion)  – received capital injections. Others, 
such as LBBW, were additionally supported with a guaran -
tee portfolio (€12½ billion), which pushed up debt. Spin-  
offs of portfolios guaranteed by state governments had the 
largest effect, accounting for more than €50 billion in total. 
These related to SachsenLB and WestLB and the latter’s 
later bad bank, the First Winding- up Agency (Erste Abwick -

ratio rose from 20% in 2007 to almost 25% in 
2012. Since then, it has fallen steadily to 18½% 
at the end of 2017 (€611 billion).
The federal states are responsible for particu -
larly personnel- intensive functions of govern -
ment. As a consequence, personnel expend -
iture accounts for by far the largest share of 
spending, at almost 40%. Spending on current 
salaried staff and civil servants has grown by an 
average of 2½% a year since 2007. Besides a 
slight increase in staffing levels, this mainly re -
flects changes in negotiated wages and civil 
servants’ pay. Pay rises roughly matched the 
moderately increased negotiated wages in the 
economy as a whole. Spending on retired civil 
servants rose much more strongly (+5½% per 
year) as there was a sharp rise in the number of 
recipients.
The federal states make large current and cap -
ital transfers to other government levels, par -
ticularly local governments. Accounting for 
one- quarter of expenditure, the latter represent 
the second- largest expense item and exhibited 
above- average growth (+5% a year). Payments 
under the local government revenue- sharing 
scheme, which largely depend on how the 
states’ tax revenue develops, grew consider -
ably. However, the central government funds 
that flow to local governments through the 
federal state budgets grew much more still. For 
instance, central government has, since 2014, 
fully reimbursed the cost of the basic allowance 
for the elderly. In addition, it has incrementally 
increased how much it contributes to the ac -
commodation costs of those receiving un -
employment benefit II. Since 2015, central gov -
ernment has also made lump- sum payments to 
deal with the influx of refugees. Finally, federal 
funds for local government investment which 
pass through the federal states’ budgets also 
rose. Alongside earlier economic stimulus pack -
ages, these include payments for the expansion 
of day care facilities for children and payments 
from the fund to promote municipal invest -
ment.Intermediate consumption also grew strongly. 
This item includes, in particular, other operating 
expenditure such as the purchase of services 
and payment of rent. As a result of refugee mi -
gration, it temporarily increased particularly 
sharply. This is evident in high growth in 2015 
and, more recently, a more muted develop -
ment.
Investment expenditure by the state govern -
ments varied considerably. The strong overall 
increase (6% per year on average) reflects, in 
part, the favourable budgetary situation over 
the past few years. Net investment was positive 
throughout – in other words, investment ex -
penditure exceeded depreciation.

as total revenue, and made up two- thirds and 
thus the largest share of revenue. Although, 
the allocation or distribution of various taxes 
among central, state and local governments 
changed, the effects on state governments’ tax 
revenue roughly cancelled each other out over -
all.8 Changes in tax legislation dampened tax 
revenue in the first couple of years. Amongst 
other things, income tax cuts were introduced 
to cushion the effects of the financial crisis. In 
subsequent years, the strong underlying trend 
was the dominant factor, and clear revenue 
growth was recorded, particularly for profit-  
related taxes. Progressive taxation also had a 
markedly positive effect on revenue.
Almost 90% of the federal states’ tax revenue 
stems from joint taxes,9 with income tax and 
corporation tax making the largest contribution 
ahead of turnover tax (see the chart above). In 
addition, federal states levy state government 
taxes.10 These are largely regulated by national 
legislation, with the exception of real estate ac -quisition tax. Since the autumn of 2006, the 
individual states have set this tax rate autono -
mously. During the interim period, this rate has 
been raised in almost all states (except Bavaria 
and Saxony) – from originally 3.5% to up to 
6.5%. The importance of this tax has thus in -
creased, but it still represents just 4½% of the 
federal states’ total tax revenue.
The second- largest revenue category are the 
transfers received from other public administra -
tions, the vast majority from central govern -
ment. These grew at a pace only slightly slower 
than tax revenue. This reflected the fact that 
additional federal funds were transferred to 
local government, as outlined above. Another 
significant factor was the transfer of funds 
from central government by way of compensa -
tion for motor vehicle tax, which has, since 
2009, been passed to central government. 
These two items mask the fact that special-  
needs supplementary central government 
grants to help reconstruct the infrastructure in 
eastern Germany are gradually coming to an 
end.
There was significantly stronger growth in rev -
enue from sales (+5½% per annum). This in -
cludes, in particular, receipts from fees, many 
of which are now received by off- budget en -
tities. They fund public services for which staff 
and other operating costs, in particular, are 
generally incurred on the expenditure side. The

8 In mid-2009, motor vehicle tax was transferred to central 
government. Since then, the federal states have received a 
transfer from central government (€9 billion a year) by way 
of compensation, which does not count as tax revenue. On 
top of that, the television licence fee has, since 2013, 
passed through the state government budgets for statis -
tical purposes (€8 billion). In addition, central government 
ceded turnover tax funds to the federal states in connec -
tion with the spike in refugees entering the country.
9 For more information on the distribution of tax revenue, 
see Table X.6 in the Statistical Section of this report.
10 State government taxes comprise, first and foremost, 
real estate acquisition tax and inheritance tax. From 2013 
onwards, they also include the television licence fee. How -
ever, in this definition, state government taxes also include 
local government taxes raised by the city states (where the 
local government level is not reported separately).Deutsche Bundesbank

The budgetary situation of 
individual federal states
Methodological adjustments 
for better comparability
The aggregate outcome for the federal states 
masks differences, in some cases large, be -
tween the individual federal states. Since the 
national accounts contain no individual state-  
level data, the government financial statistics 
are used here for a state- by- state breakdown. 
The available data material is further processed 
to ensure that key figures are as meaningful as 
possible.
The starting point for budgetary analyses is 
usually the core budget. However, in some fed -
eral states, the core budget does not include a 
large part of activities. Consequently, the fed -
eral states’ off- budget entities included in the 
government sector are factored in – bringing 
the procedure more into line with the national 
accounts.11 This neutralises the circumstance 
that some entities (such as universities) have, in 
many federal states, been moved off the core 
budgets and that reserves (such as pension 
funds) are used in different ways. For instance, 
high transfers to provisions weighed on the 
core budget in North Rhine-  Westphalia in 2017. 
While the core budget had a deficit, this was 
balanced out by a surplus in the relevant off-  
budget entity. It is easier to compare the out -
come for North Rhine-  Westphalia with other 
federal states’ results if the pension reserves 
and the core budget are analysed together.
Local governments are also included. This 
allows a comparison of non- city states with city 
states, which do not report local government- 
level data separately.12 In addition, tasks are 
distributed differently between the federal 
state and the local government level in the 
non- city states. For a consolidated analysis, it would not matter if a federal state were to re -
duce its payments under the local government 
revenue-  sharing scheme. This would merely 
shift the financial problems to the local govern -
ments, for which the federal state ultimately 
bears joint responsibility.13
As in the national accounts, financial transac -
tions are also excluded.14 These influence the 
fiscal balances recorded in the government 
financial  statistics in individual federal states 
and years, significantly so in some cases. In 
principle, however, they merely reallocate fi -
nancial assets. In a privatisation, for example, 
(net) financial assets remain unchanged: there 
is an inflow of cash, but equity holdings de -
cline. By excluding transactions of this nature, 
the objective is to paint a more precise picture 
of the financial situation.
In addition, payments under the state govern -
ment revenue- sharing scheme are recorded on 
an accruals basis. Settlements that are not 
made and recorded in the government finan -
cial statistics until the following year are ac -
counted for in the reporting year.15
Finally, cyclical influences are stripped out in 
order to better depict the structural budgetary 
position. While these influences have a largely 
uniform impact on the individual federal states 
owing to the state government revenue-  Enhancing the

12 The city states’ population is given a 35% higher 
weighting in the state government revenue- sharing scheme 
in order to compensate for the fact that central areas have 
higher financial requirements than the surrounding areas.

ences between the federal states, Monthly Report, October 
2012, pp. 36 ff.
14 However, adjustments are made in the national ac -
counts if the budget shows a financial transaction but the 
national accounts criteria are not met. This would be the 
case, say, for an injection of capital without the prospect of 
profit distribution or to compensate for a loss. Such adjust -
ments cannot be reconstructed for this article.

settlement transactions for the reporting year and the pre -
ceding year.Deutsche Bundesbank

sharing scheme,16 such an adjustment makes 
sense for a comparison over time.
The budget situation in 201717
The surpluses of the federal states as a whole 
climbed to an all- time high (€27 billion, or 
0.8% of GDP) in 2017, even in terms of the 
methodological adjustments outlined above.18 
With the exception of Saarland, all federal 
states posted a surplus (see the table on pp. 20 
and 21). Per capita, Mecklenburg-  West Pomer -
ania recorded the highest amount (€660), 
which was twice the national average.19
Debt servicing has a significant impact on the 
budget situation of the individual federal states 
(see the box on p. 23 focusing on Bremen and 
Saarland). This is predominantly due to differ -
ent debt levels.20 For instance, at the end of 
2017, the per capita debt level in Bremen was 
more than three and a half times higher than the national reference figure (see the chart on 
p. 24). The level in Hamburg and Saarland was 
still around twice as high. As a result, per capita 
interest expenditure21 was highest in Bremen – 
almost five times the national reference figure 
of €210 (see the chart on p. 26). But interest 
costs were also just over twice as high in Ham -
burg and Saarland. By contrast, Bavaria and 
Saxony recorded particularly low levels.
However, in many cases, debt is also offset by 
sizeable financial assets.22 These can be in -
cluded in the calculations, at least in part, by 
deducting interest income from interest ex -
penditure (net interest burden).23 In these net 
terms, Saxony no longer had a burden and 
Hamburg’s high interest costs fell by almost 
half. Bremen’s interest income was also way 
above average.

16 The cyclical effect for the federal states as a whole (see 
footnote 5 on p. 15) is allocated to the individual federal 
states based on the previous year’s tax revenue shares (as 
in the consolidation assistance procedure). The same is 
done for the local governments. The individual federal 
states apply various methods for their debt brakes, and the 
estimation results differ considerably in some cases.
17 To improve comparability among the federal states, the 
relevant figures are shown in relation to the population size 
(per capita analysis).
18 The surpluses thus significantly exceeded the cyclically 
adjusted national accounts balance of state government 
and local government combined (€16½ billion). One con -
tributory factor was that the financial support provided by 
Hamburg and Schleswig- Holstein to HSH  Nordbank is 
classed as a loan (financial transaction) in the government 
financial statistics. However, in the national accounts, it is 
booked as a capital transfer, thus lowering the surplus.
19 An average weighted by the share of the population is 
used for the national reference figure. Larger states thus 
have a greater impact.
20 This includes debt in the non- public and in the public 
sector. It is not possible to rule out errors in consolidation 
using the figures available for the individual federal states.
21 As with the similar definition of debt, this includes inter -
est expenditure to areas of the non- public sector and other 
public sector entities.
22 According to the Federal Statistical Office’s financial 
asset stock statistics, the total stock of state and local gov -
ernment financial assets amounted to €580 billion at the 
end of 2017. However, this figure has not been adjusted for 
loans to other public sector entities and is thus overstated. 
As a result, it is not directly comparable with the consoli -
dated debt level of state and local government as defined 
under the Maastricht Treaty (around €760 billion at the end 
of 2017).

The signifi  cance of special assistance for Bremen 
and Saarland 
With the debt brake, consolidation assistance 
was introduced for particularly highly in-
debted federal states. The costs are split be-
tween central government and state govern-
ments. An annual volume of €800 million has 
been earmarked for this purpose for the 2011 
to 2019 fi  scal years. The lion’s share of this 
sum goes to two small states: Saarland (€260 
million, or €260 per capita) and Bremen (€300 
million, or €440 per capita).1 The disburse-
ment of assistance is conditional on progress 
in consolidation.2 It has taken place every year 
thus far.
Last year, Bremen achieved an adjusted sur-
plus (i.e. including interest burden and con-
solidation assistance) of €240.3 Saarland, 
meanwhile, was still running a defi  cit (€70). 
Despite the extraordinarily low level of interest 
rates, high debt levels have still been weigh-
ing particularly heavily on both states: Saar-
land’s net interest burden4 was €280 higher 
than the national average, and that of Bremen 
€660 higher. This was partly compensated for 
by consolidation assistance, however, which 
nearly fully offset the additional burden in 
Saarland and knocked off as much as two- 
thirds of the additional burden in Bremen. 
Bremen’s basic fi  scal position (in turn, exclud-
ing net interest burden and consolidation as-
sistance) was recently markedly better than 
the national average, whereas Saarland still 
fell perceptibly short of the national average.
As from 2020, both states will receive new, 
higher special payments from central govern-
ment. Each state will receive €400 million in 
budgetary recovery assistance annually (€400 
per capita in Saarland and €590 per capita in 
Bremen). Based on fi  gures for 2017, the funds 
almost completely cover Bremen’s additional 
interest burden, while they even overcompen-
sate Saarland’s by a wide margin. This puts 
these two states in a better position than 
other states with above- average debt levels.There is no formal time limit on the budgetary 
recovery assistance, which appears to be as-
sured for well over a decade.5 Virtually no 
repay ment conditions are attached to these 
funds. This assistance is therefore not specifi  c-
ally pushing states to bring their budgetary 
outturns (net of the assistance) perceptibly 
closer to the federal state average. There is 
therefore a risk of structural dependency on 
budgetary recovery assistance. If efforts to 
scale back debt levels considerably do not 
succeed, both states will, in the medium to 
long term, also be more vulnerable to rising 
interest rates. It is therefore advisable to ini-
tially use only a smaller portion of the new 
funds for additional expenditure. A more ex-
pedient course of action would be to defuse 
the debt situation, something for which the 
henceforth expanded special assistance would 
provide a sound fi  nancial basis. That would 
help Bremen and Saarland, and not just in 
terms of complying with the debt brake. A 
federal structure which is based more strongly 
on individual responsibility of the federal 
states should then be seen as an opportunity.
1 In 1992, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that 
these states were in extreme budgetary hardship. In 
order to overcome this state of affairs, they received 
extensive special assistance up until 2004, which was 
progressively reduced towards the end.
2 When identifying progress, no account is taken of 
this assistance, as the idea behind it is not to directly 
create any additional fi  scal leeway. Instead, it is de-
signed to ensure that a sound budgetary position is 
achieved and that the recipient can independently 
comply with the debt brake as of 2020.

from the government fi  nance statistics; the method 
used to calculate them (including cyclical adjustment) 
is described on p. 19. For ease of comparability, the

assistance.

5 Pursuant to Article 143 f. of the Basic Law (Grund-
gesetz), three or more federal states, for instance, can, 
as of 2031, jointly demand renegotiations on the 
revenue- sharing scheme and thus also on budgetary 
recovery assistance. The assistance would then expire 
unless new arrangements are agreed within fi  ve years.Deutsche Bundesbank

The budgetary position excluding the net inter -
est burden (adjusted structural primary bal -
ance) was most favourable in the city states 
(see the chart on p. 27). Of the non- city states, 
Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania and Thuringia 
recorded by far the highest surpluses. Without 
the net interest burden, Saarland, in particular, 
came much closer to the state average, closely 
followed by Baden-  Württemberg.
Changes since 2007
State governments’ underlying budgetary pos -
ition has improved immensely over the last ten 
years. The differences among the states have 
also eased considerably. In 2007, in addition to 
the five eastern states, only Bavaria, Baden-  
Württemberg and Hamburg had noteworthy 
surpluses (according to the definition and ad -
justments outlined above). Calculated in this 
way, the per capita deficits in 2007 were at 
their highest in Bremen (€1,250).The favourable development is attributable, on 
the one hand, to the net interest burden, which 
has fallen significantly in all federal states, in 
particular due to the favourable borrowing 
conditions (see the chart on p. 26). Yet, there 
has been almost no change in the range of 
interest burdens among the federal states. The 
fall in interest rates provided particularly great 
relief for some highly indebted states, but it 
was largely outweighed by less favourable debt 
movements (see also the box on p. 25).
On the other hand, the structural budgetary 
position (after deduction of the net interest 
burden) improved. This was due to extremely 
positive developments in those states that had 
been running a deficit at that time. By contrast, 
some states whose structural budgets were al -
ready in surplus eased their budgetary position. 
This was the case for Saxony, in particular, but 
also Baden-  Württemberg and Saxony-  Anhalt 
(see the chart on p. 27).Budget situation

Interest expenditure:
impact of debt levels and average interest rates
The amount of (gross) interest expenditure 
is determined by the level of debt and the 
average rate of interest. All the federal 
states have benefi  ted from the dramatic im-
provement in borrowing conditions. For in-
stance, the average interest rate calculated 
from the cash statistics for state govern-
ment as a whole (including local govern-
ment and off- budget entities) is half as high 
as it was in 2007, at just over 2%.1 This de-
cline has had a particularly positive effect 
on highly indebted federal states. On a 
national  average, the receding average 
interest rates have translated into per capita 
relief of €210 compared with 2007 levels 
(€17 billion in total). Bremen and Saarland 
have benefi  ted the most, their relief coming 
to €520 and €400 per capita, respectively.
Debt levels in the individual federal states 
have continued to diverge, not least on 
account  of the varying budget outturns 
they have registered since 2007 (see the 
chart on p. 24).2 They receded in the federal 
states of Bavaria, Berlin, Mecklenburg- West Pomerania and Saxony, but climbed else-
where. Bremen experienced the strongest 
per capita growth, followed by Saarland 
and Hamburg some way behind. Interest 
expenditure contracted only marginally on 
balance in Saarland, and it even saw an-
other increase in Bremen. In some cases, 
though, these contrasting fortunes have 
been driven in part by one- off factors. Fur-
thermore, debt levels may have risen, but 
so, too, has the stock of fi  nancial assets and 
interest income.3
1 The average rate of interest is the reported interest 
expenditure as a percentage of the amount of debt at 
the end of the previous year. In some federal states, 
the average interest rate differs signifi  cantly from the 
fi  gure stated due to the effects of interest rate hedges 
in particular.
2 The debt statistics for 2007 include only a small 
number of off- budget entities. However, it was only 
after that date that debt levels at these entities such as 
the bad banks began to rise signifi  cantly. Therefore, 
the comparison with the year 2017 should not be too 
distorted.
3 The data for North Rhine- Westphalia, for example, 
were affected by the establishment of the First 
Winding- up Agency (Erste Abwicklungsanstalt), the 
state- owned bad bank tasked with winding up the op-
erations of WestLB. The debts managed by this Agency 
are offset by a stock of fi  nancial assets which are a 
source of interest income. By winding up these assets, 
the Agency expects to be able to scale back the debt 
level substantially over time. Bremen likewise saw its 
debt levels rise by far more than the defi  cits recorded 
in the core budget. The increase in interest expenditure 
was offset by strong growth in interest income during 
this period.How state and local government interest 
expenditure evolved between 2007 and

Total revenue and total 
expenditure  in 2017
The state government revenue- sharing scheme, 
for one, makes it difficult to compare total rev -
enue and expenditure across the federal states. 
Federal states with a large financial capacity 
post “inflated” figures. They collect an above-  
average amount of tax revenue, part of which 
is dispensed again via payments into the state 
government revenue- sharing scheme. In order 
to neutralise this impact, payments under the 
revenue- sharing scheme made by the states 
providing contributions are recorded net; i.e. 
these payments are deducted from the total 
revenue and expenditure of the states in ques -
tion.
Furthermore, the individual states outsource a 
varying amount of tasks to private enterprises 
outside the government sector. Where tasks 
have been outsourced, government revenue 
and expenditure are lower. On the one hand, the corresponding receipts from fees, in par -
ticular, are no longer recorded on the revenue 
side. On the other hand, there is above all no 
personnel expenditure, other operating ex -
penditure or spending on fixed asset formation 
on the expenditure side, respectively. There -
fore, if a state records higher receipts from 
fees, this does not necessarily mean greater 
budgetary scope or higher burdens for the 
population than in other federal states. As a re -
sult, the particularly high level of receipts from 
fees recorded in Hamburg and partly in North 
Rhine-  Westphalia is to be put into perspective, 
as is the higher level of spending observed in 
the corresponding categories in those states. In 
order to improve comparability of total revenue 
and total expenditure among federal states, re -
ceipts from fees are also recorded net here (i.e. 
deducted from total revenue and expenditure).
These adjustments considerably lowered the 
spread of total revenue and expenditure (see 
the table on pp. 20 and 21). The differences in Limited compar -

interest expenditure outlined above can be 
seen on the expenditure side. Of the non- city 
states, Saxony-  Anhalt recorded the highest 
level of other expenditure. However, this was 
offset by particularly high transfers from central 
government. Saxony-  Anhalt was closely fol -
lowed by Hesse which, at the same time, had a 
high level of tax revenue. Mecklenburg-  West 
Pomerania was at the other end of the scale 
and also posted the highest surplus due to its 
relatively low level of expenditure. The values 
recorded by the city states were way above 
average: Hamburg recorded the highest level 
of other expenditure, closely followed by 
Bremen where tax revenue was much lower 
and the interest burden far higher.
Notes on selected expenditure 
categories
Staff costs are the largest expenditure item for 
all federal states. Expenditure for current staff per inhabitant is already very varied in the non- 
city states. For example, Brandenburg spent 
almost  a quarter more on staff than Schleswig- 
Holstein. However, the largest amounts were 
recorded in the city states, especially Hamburg. 
Yet, caution should be exercised when inter -
preting these figures. Some federal states con -
tract out public services outside the govern -
ment budgets. One example is privately run 
institutions taking on childcare. The states’ 
own staff costs are then lower, but grants to 
such institutions are higher.
A key factor behind staff costs is staff numbers. 
In the core government areas, staff numbers 
are again particularly high in the city states 
and, above all, in Bremen (see the chart on 
p. 28). But the eastern states, too – with the 
exception of Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania – 
have staff levels that are way above average. 
The lowest levels are in Schleswig- Holstein and 
Bavaria.Higher expend -

Furthermore, pay rates differ from one federal 
state to the next. While negotiated rates of pay 
– with a few exceptions – have been collect -
ively agreed throughout Germany, civil servant 
pay rates differ, in some cases considerably, 
among the federal states. There has been no 
national uniform legislation since the 2006 fed -
eral structure reform, with the result that 
Bavaria’s  annual gross civil servant pay rate in 
the final level of A 13 – the pay grade for a 
great many civil servants – was just over 6% 
higher than the average this year (see the chart 
on p. 29). Saarland recorded the lowest level.24In a ruling on judges’ remuneration, the Federal 
Constitutional Court found no cause for con -
cern if civil servant pay rates are up to one-  
tenth lower than the average. Furthermore, dif -
ferent costs of living could distort an economic 
assessment of the varying pay rates. If the costs 
of living are lower, real remuneration is corres -
pondingly higher. This is likely to be the case in 
the eastern states.25 There is also a certain de -
gree of scope when assigning civil servants to 
various pay grades for certain functions. Offi -
cial statistics do not contain any information on 
this, however. Overall, then, federal states do 
have ways in which to adjust these rates in 
order to meet state- specific consolidation re -
quirements, for instance.
The spread for spending on civil servant pen -
sions per inhabitant is even wider than it is for 
current personnel expenditure. This is predom -
inantly attributable to lower numbers of recipi -
ents in the eastern states (see the adjacent 
chart). The eastern states make special pay -
ments to central government for special and 
supplementary pension payments made to for -
mer employees from the period prior to reunifi -
cation. But even after factoring in these ex -
penses, the eastern states reached, at most, 
two- thirds of the national result. Of the west -
ern German non- city states, Schleswig- Holstein 
was the only state below the national reference 
figure. Saarland exceeded the national refer -
ence figure by one- fifth, although the fact that 
population trends there have been weak for 
some time had an impact on per capita ex -
penditure. The city states of Hamburg and 
Bremen have to foot an even heftier bill.
There are also substantial differences in trans -
fers to households. North Rhine-  Westphalia, 
Bremen and Hesse recorded the highest ex -
penditure. It is the needs- based social benefits … and differ -

(such as basic allowance benefits), in particular, 
that have been driving up this item. Such bene -
fits tend to be focused on regions where the 
population is denser or the economy weaker. 
Specific decisions regarding the division of re -
sponsibilities,26 but also the range of benefits, 
are also likely to be a factor. It is difficult to 
derive from the government financial statistics 
the actual net burden on a state from social 
benefits. This is also because central govern -
ment’s contribution differs. For instance, cen -
tral government grants towards the accommo -
dation costs of recipients of unemployment 
benefit II, the full refund of basic allowances for 
the elderly as well as other cost reimburse -
ments have varying effects from state to state.
Spending on other operating expenditure and 
fixed asset formation also varies considerably. 
Here, too, it is difficult to interpret the figures 
because tasks are outsourced to non-  public 
sector entities to varying degrees. In both ex -
penditure categories, comparison is distorted 
by the extremely high values recorded in Ham -
burg. The high levels of investment in Hamburg 
are mostly posted by off- budget entities. Bav -
aria and Baden-  Württemberg are not far be -
hind Hamburg, recording large volumes of in -
vestment, too. Bremen and, in particular, Saar -
land have below- average values but are still 
way ahead of Berlin. Past and present budget -
ary strains also ultimately have a negative im -
pact on investment levels. A shortage of staff 
may currently also be holding back the imple -
mentation of investment projects. The govern -
ment financial statistics do not contain invest -
ment in the form of public- private partnerships. 
Ultimately, in order to ensure that the compari -
son across states is meaningful, attention 
should be focused more on the public infra -
structure provided than the level of expend -
iture. However, this information is not avail -
able.Notes on selected revenue

to other areas (other operating expenditure) whereas, in 
other states, similar payments are included under social

operating expenditure is higher in Saxony-  Anhalt than in 
most other states.

enue differences turn out to be somewhat 
larger is that only just under two- thirds of local 
government tax revenue is taken into account 
in this scheme. In the original allocation of 
taxes (i.e. before turnover tax revenue is reallo -
cated), the differences among states are more 
apparent. In many cases, shifts in the original 
allocation were strictly limited over the last dec -
ade. The development in North Rhine-  
Westphalia was striking. Its financial capacity in 
this regard has diminished more or less con -
tinuously. At last count, it was significantly 
lower than the average. Overall, in 2017, the 
spread of per capita tax revenue ranged from 
€6,450 in Hamburg to €4,200 in Saxony-  
Anhalt. The national average stood at €4,720 
(non- city states: €4,610; city states: €6,080). Of 
the non- city states, Hesse recorded the highest 
amount (€4,910).29
The taxes set autonomously by state or local 
governments vary greatly. The differences in 
real estate acquisition tax rates are consider -
able. Five states –  including Saarland  – now 
have a rate of 6.5%. By contrast, Bavaria and 
Saxony have kept their rate at the former uni -
form national level of 3.5%. In 2017, the city 
states tended to record the highest average 
rates for local government real estate tax B and 
local business tax. The multipliers for real estate 
tax B are the most widely scattered of these 
taxes. Berlin has the top position with 810%. 
Of the non- city states, local governments in 
North Rhine-  Westphalia had the highest multi -
pliers (570%) on average. Some local govern -
ments with a particularly tense budget situ -
ation recorded rates that were far higher than 
in Berlin. Schleswig- Holstein and Bavaria had 
the lowest average multipliers (390%). Local 
business tax rates were not spread quite so 
widely across the federal states. They ranged 
from 470% in Hamburg to 320% in Branden -
burg. All in all, local government multipliers 
rose distinctly over the past decade, although 
local governments recently posted significant 
fiscal surpluses. Larger debt burdens and rela -
tively unfavourable budget situations meant 
higher tax rates.30In addition to tax revenue, central government 
transfers play a key role.31 On average, these 
amounted to €560 per capita. But the eastern 
states recorded much higher levels. The special- 
needs supplementary central government 
grants for infrastructure reconstruction in east -
ern Germany and to offset the higher burdens 
caused by long- term unemployment still 
amounted to around €270 per capita in these 
states in 2017. Consolidation assistance did not 
have much of an impact in Berlin, Saxony-  
Anhalt and Schleswig-  Holstein. However, it 
benefited Bremen and Saarland enormously.
All in all, there are special factors which make 
inter-  state comparisons of individual revenue 
and expenditure items extremely difficult in 
some cases. There is no comprehensive, up- to- 
date set of data on revenue and expenditure 
broken down according to government func -
tions. Some state governments and the local 
government level for the most part have intro -
duced double- entry bookkeeping, which could 
additionally complicate the comparability of re -
sults from government financial statistics. 
Ideally, data –  broken down by government 
function – would be published promptly, thus 
improving comparability across the board. This 
would enable the financial impact of policy de -
cisions to be outlined more clearly and made 
more transparent for the general public. Mean -
ingful budget data augmented by comparisons 
of the results, for instance as with the Pisa tests 
for schools, could generally help to better iden -
tify promising policy approaches. It therefore

29 Bavaria recorded €4,740. The lower amount in com -
parison with Hesse is ultimately due to taxes that are set at 
state and local government- specific rates, and these are 
higher in Hesse. In the state government revenue- sharing 
scheme, Bavaria has a higher financial capacity because the 
calculations are based on normalised tax rates.
30 However, for local government multipliers, it is evidently 
also important how strictly the state government budget -
ary supervision implements the provisions governing a bal -
anced budget.

purposes. This could sustainably strengthen 
federalism in Germany as a whole.
Budgetary surveillance by 
the Stability Council
The tasks of the Stability 
Council
The Stability Council was established with the 
anchoring of the debt brake in Germany’s Basic 
Law. Its members are the Federal Minister of 
Finance, the federal states’ finance ministers 
and the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs 
and Energy. The Council is intended to play the 
central role in budgetary surveillance in Ger -
many and has a variety of tasks.
First, the Council is there to monitor budgetary 
developments in central government and the 
individual federal states and warn against im -
pending budgetary hardship. To do this, four 
predefined key figures were agreed, with two 
of them being ultimately based on the level of 
debt. Any budgetary recovery procedure de -
pends on an irregularity being flagged by the 
majority of the key figures and is therefore 
likely to be triggered only at a very late stage. 
Overall, the key figures used so far have not 
been convincing.32
Second, the Stability Council monitors progress 
made by the federal states which are receiving 
consolidation assistance: Berlin, Bremen, Saar -
land, Saxony-  Anhalt and Schleswig- Holstein. 
These federal states show particularly high 
levels of debt and, in 2011, agreed reduction 
paths for their structural budget deficits. If 
these are complied with, assistance payments 
totalling €800 million annually are pledged up 
to 2019. So far, the tests have invariably been 
positive. The chosen approach has not been 
convincing in this respect either. For example, 
major off- budget entities of individual federal 
states are left out if they do not have any bor -
rowing authorisations. These include, say, pen -
sion reserves that can be structured flexibly and one large Berlin investment fund. Furthermore, 
the definition of the financial transactions that 
have been deducted is less than satisfactory. 
Moreover, the (per capita) cyclical components 
that have been included sometimes vary a 
great deal from one federal state to the next. 
This seems inappropriate, because the state 
government revenue- sharing scheme ought to 
largely offset cyclical developments specific to 
each federal state’s economy.33
Third, the Stability Council monitors compli -
ance with the EU requirements for budgetary 
discipline. In doing so, it is supported by an in -
dependent advisory board. In accordance with 
the European rules, the general government 
budget has to be close to balance in structural 
terms. For Germany, an upper limit of 0.5% ap -
plies to the structural deficit ratio. If there is a 
risk of the upper limit being exceeded, the 
Council is to recommend consolidation meas -
ures. Since this task was transferred to the 
Council in 2014, this limit has been complied 
with, as expected by the Council and its advis -
ory board. However, it is likely that the safety 
margins will become smaller again in future, 
especially given instances of recourse to the ex -
tensive reserves. The latter, in particular, pose a 
challenge for monitoring (see the box on 
p. 32). Overall, the documentation submitted 
to the Council needs to be improved so that 
future developments can be estimated as reli -
ably as possible.34
Fourth, the Stability Council will, from 2020 on -
wards, assess whether central government and 
the individual federal states are complying with 
the debt brake. This was decided in 2017, when 
financial relations within Germany’s federal sys -
tem were restructured. For central government, The tasks of

structural net borrowing since 2016 is limited 
to a maximum of 0.35% of GDP . The individual 
federal states will have to balance their budgets 
by 2020 at the latest without (structural) new 
net borrowing. If the Stability Council were to 
diagnose a breach of the rules, this would have 
no direct legal or financial consequences. It 
would, however, be a clear signal to the state 
government concerned and to the general 
public. This diagnosis might also be relevant in 
proceedings before a constitutional court.
Many federal states still have not finalised the 
details of their debt brake. It would make the 
Stability Council’s job easier if the rules were 
largely harmonised and geared to the Euro -
pean target variables. However, the current sta -
tus shows that the approaches taken do differ 
quite substantially (see also the box on pp. 40 
to 47). It is therefore all the more important to 
agree transparent monitoring procedures and 
have meaningful and comparable information 
available as soon as possible.
Requirements for budgetary 
surveillance
Fiscal rules can play an important part in safe -
guarding sound public finances. Budgetary sur -
veillance has a key role to play in this. It would 
seem prudent to make independent boards re -
sponsible for these activities.35 This is also en -
visaged by the European fiscal rules for the na -
tional budgetary surveillance of the Member 
States. In Germany, this role is performed 
chiefly by the Stability Council. Thus, the Fed -
eral Ministry of Finance and the federal states’ 
finance ministries are to monitor themselves via 
the Council. The independent advisory board 
mainly plays a part in monitoring the European 
rules for general government and is substan -
tially dependent on the documentation pro -
vided by the Stability Council.Differences in

details of federal 
states’ debt 
brakes
Independent 
boards of 
particular  
importanceReserves as a challenge 
for the European fi  scal 
framework
Central, state and local governments as 
well as social security funds have built 
up sizeable reserves. In particular, the 
surpluses of recent years have often 
been used to form reserves and to pre- 
fi  nance off- budget entities. Sizeable 
funds can be withdrawn from these 
sources if required. The fact that provi-
sion is being made for future expenses is 
to be welcomed. Nevertheless, special 
requirements in terms of transparency 
and coordination should apply with re-
gard to the European fi  scal framework 
in the event of these funds being drawn 
on to a major extent. If reserves are 
drawn on, net borrowing in budgetary 
terms will be lower, and it will be easier 
to adhere to debt brakes that are linked 
to this item. However, the European fi  s-
cal framework relates to the defi  cit, 
which is not reduced by making with-
drawals from reserves.1 One major ex-
ample of such reserves is central govern-
ment’s refugee reserve. This is set to be 
used up over the next few years to fi  -
nance structural defi  cits. At the end of 
2017, social security funds had free re-
serves in the amount of €88 billion. If 
more extensive use were to be made of 
such reserves to cover structural bur-
dens –  as will be the case in future 
with  the statutory pension insurance 
scheme – the general government def-
icit ceiling might be exceeded even 
though there is no net borrowing. In 
this case, the Stability Council would 
have to recommend measures in order 
to maintain the defi  cit ceiling.

In order to ensure stringent budgetary surveil -
lance in this approach, the procedures should 
be clearly structured and rule- bound. The gen -
eral public should also be able to understand 
how the current situation looks and what risks 
exist in terms of failing to comply with national 
or European rules. Transparency is of key im -
portance in this context. The budgetary key fig -
ures for central government and the individual 
federal states would have to be informative, 
up- to- date and comparable. In each instance, 
there would have to be an account of what 
effect the expected developments have with 
regard to the requirements of the respective 
debt brakes and the European rules. At present, 
only the rudimentary elements of this are in 
place.
The task of monitoring the debt brakes as from 
2020 has considerably widened the Stability 
Council’s mandate. This presents the opportun -
ity to achieve a major advance in budgetary 
surveillance. It would be important to eliminate 
any grounds to suspect that the ministries of 
finance will take a lenient view of each other’s 
books and are not interested in transparency. 
All things considered, this would not need to 
add substantially to the data collection work -
load. Responsible budgetary policy already im -
plies comprehensive monitoring and planning 
systems. To a large extent, the pre-  existing in -
formation from these systems would merely 
have to be harmonised, updated as necessary 
and then published.
Enhanced fiscal surveillance is yet to be given 
concrete form by the Stability Council. Assum -
ing the debt brake is strictly adhered to, 
budgetary hardship should, by rights, be a 
thing of the past. If, from 2020, the federal 
states regularly achieve a structurally balanced 
budget with no net borrowing, a permanent 
rise in debt beyond the level then reached 
would be ruled out in principle. It would there -
fore be logical for the focus in future to be on 
monitoring compliance with the debt brakes. 
The current or medium- term threat of conflicts 
with constitutional requirements would have to be highlighted and suitable countermeasures 
recommended.
Nevertheless, the debt brakes also allow excep -
tions to the ban on new borrowing. Borrowing 
is permitted if this is for building up financial 
assets.36 Cyclical developments or the exemp -
tion clause for emergency situations may also 
justify new borrowing temporarily. In the pro -
cess, biases in the method of cyclical adjust -
ment, utilised exemption clauses with repay -
ment outstanding and assumptions of debt 
that are not taken into account may lead to a 
sustained build- up of debt. This would be con -
trary to the intention of the Basic Law, under 
which only a rising stock of financial assets 
would justify a structural build- up of debt. To 
allow for this in the budgetary surveillance pro -
cess, it would be vital for the federal states, 
first, to give the Stability Council an account of 
the transaction- related change in their level of 
debt and their stock of financial assets since 
the introduction of the debt brake (including, 
in each case, the relevant off- budget entities). 
Second, the sum of the cyclical components 
taken into account and of the deviations from 
the structural annual upper limit in the budget 
outturn would also have to be stated. The 
Council could determine ex ante thresholds for 
the build- up of debt, from and above which it 
could call for a rule- based medium- term repay -
ment.
The information provided to the Council 
should, besides the debt brake, also make it 
verifiable whether there is a risk of breaching 
the European rules. To do this, the Stability 
Council, say, would also have to apply the 
European cyclical adjustment procedure to 
each of the expected budget outturns. Further -
more, the key figures should be brought more 
closely into line with the methodology and sec -
toral classification of the national accounts.

additional data and estimates and providing in -High degree of

Budgetary surveillance: good information basis is crucial
The Stability Council is responsible for moni-
toring compliance with the debt brakes of 
the individual federal states and the Euro-
pean fi  scal rules for general government. To 
do this, sound and up- to- date basic infor-
mation on the important factors has to be 
available. This is not suffi   ciently ensured at 
present.
General requirements1
The European rules are directed at general 
government defi  cits as defi  ned in the na-
tional accounts. Budgetary surveillance 
therefore calls for a consistent and current 
estimate of the government account within 
the national accounts. This should be based 
on appropriate projections as defi  ned in the 
budget accounts (government fi  nance stat-
istics) for central, state and local govern-
ment and social security funds (and their 
main schemes). The focus should not only 
be on the core budgets, but also on the rest 
of the government sector included in the 
national accounts. The transition from the 
budgetary statistics to the national accounts 
should be clear in identifying the key ways 
in which it has been implemented. The fi  s-
cal estimates need to be based on a current 
macroeconomic projection. This is used to 
derive the estimated cyclical effects.
For monitoring the debt brakes, estimates 
for the relevant data from central and indi-
vidual state governments have to be avail-
able. With regard to the general govern-
ment defi  cit ceiling, the contributions of the 
individual federal states should also be 
made clear. Besides the off- budget entities, 
it would also be vital in this regard to have 
the best possible budget estimate for the 
local government level under their budget-
ary supervision.Key fi  gures
For appropriate, well- founded and trans-
parent budgetary surveillance, central gov-
ernment and the individual state govern-
ments should provide a standardised over-
view of their current fi  nancial position and 
outlook.2 Information that would appear 
necessary for such surveillance is shown on 
p. 36 for the Länder by way of an example. 
Corresponding information should also be 
provided by central government. It may be 
assumed that central and state govern-
ments already possess most of this informa-
tion from their budget management and 
control. This basic information should be 
made available to the Stability Council in 
updated form at the time of auditing. There 
is no reason why this information should 
not be made accessible to the general pub-
lic, too.
For the individual indicators, both the re-
sults for the past two years and the latest 
estimate for the current year and the me-
dium term should be reported. This would 
represent a major advance on the data in 
the current stability reports on emergency 
prevention. At present these contain a com-
pilation of budget planning information 
with very different data vintages in some 
instances . In many cases, for example, that 
data for the Länder have not been brought 
into line with the latest offi   cial tax estimate. 
In this respect, it is mostly not possible to

Council, Neunte Stellungnahme zur Einhaltung der

2 This is fundamentally envisaged for European 
budgetary surveillance, too. The individual Member 
States should submit updated and standardised fore-
casts about their own fi  nances at specifi  c points in 
time; these then undergo a rule- based evaluation.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2018  
34

discern the currently expected develop-
ment.3
On the revenue side, taxes are the most im-
portant item. If a state government’s fore-
cast differs from the regionalisation (alloca-
tion between the Länder) of the last offi   cial 
tax estimate, this should be explained. Pos-
sible reasons might be an update by the 
state government in the interim, features 
that are specifi  c to the given federal state 
such as an assumed divergence in economic 
or demographic development, or changes 
in tax legislation for which additional allow-
ance has been made in the budget. Consid-
eration should also be given to updated 
projections for the state government 
revenue- sharing scheme, the general sup-
plementary central government grants and, 
where applicable, for the local government 
revenue- sharing scheme.
A key item on the expenditure side is per-
sonnel expenditure. Data on the expected 
development of staffi   ng levels and the 
number of civil servant pension recipients 
are vital. Any planned decoupling of civil 
servant pay rates from national trends 
would also be relevant.
Further key items to be reported might in-
clude other operating expenditure and fi  xed 
asset formation.
In the case of interest expenditure, data on 
assumed interest rates would be essential. 
As defi  ned in the budget, interest rates are 
heavily infl  uenced by premiums, discounts 
and effects of derivatives positions. These 
items generally have no direct impact on 
national accounts results, however, and 
should therefore be shown.
If global items (for example, planned ex-
penditure shortfalls or revenue windfalls) 
are included in the budget estimate, these 
should be listed.Financial transactions have a different im-
pact on the results in the budgets and in the 
national accounts. In order to assess such 
effects, these transactions should be shown 
on both the revenue and expenditure side. 
This should be based, as far as possible, on 
the strict requirements of the national ac-
counts for fi  nancial transactions (acquisition 
or redemption of fi  nancial assets with genu-
ine recoverable value): capital injections 
without a prospect of profi  t or for the pur-
pose of offsetting losses should form as lit-
tle a part of this as calls on guarantees.
Any reserve transactions affecting the 
budget, such as reserves or off- budget en-
tities, should also be reported. Important 
examples are the use of “repealed” borrow-
ing authorisations or withdrawals from the 
special funds for pension provisions. Al-
though such transactions reduce net bor-
rowing in budgetary terms, they do not im-
prove the fi  scal balance (which is consoli-
dated with off- budget entities). They can be 
designed fl  exibly by the individual federal 
states and could conceal the structural 
budgetary position.
Where more signifi  cant one- off factors af-
fect the budget outturn, it would be desir-
able to include a memorandum item. Ex-
amples are the fi  ne paid by Volkswagen to 
the federal state of Lower Saxony in the 
current year or extensive sales of fi  xed 
assets. This would make it easier to assess 
the underlying budgetary position.
In addition to net borrowing and the fi  scal 
balance according to the budget statistics, 
a balance consistent with the national ac-
counts should also be shown. This should 
be adjusted for fi  nancial transactions as 
well as other known major adjustment

Finance for the results of the state governments as a 
whole are updated in principle, but do not permit any

Outlook and conclusions
Following the favourable outturn in 2017, the 
positive development in state government fi -
nances is continuing. In the current year, the 
surplus adjusted for special factors is likely to 
increase further after the strong half-  year re -
sult.37 Even after adjustment for the positive 
economic situation, a marked surplus is in the 
offing. It is not possible to tell at present 
whether the disparity between federal states 
will narrow further. This would be desirable as 
the significant lingering differences make polit -
ical decisions with a nationwide fiscal impact 
more difficult. For instance, in light of the fa -
vourable state of German public finances, there 
is talk of cutting national income tax rates. In some federal states, potential conflicts with the 
debt brake or short- term consolidation needs 
can be avoided once the fiscal positions are 
more closely converged.
An ambitious fiscal policy is advisable especially 
for highly indebted federal states. These are 
benefiting very strongly from the low funding 
costs in a low interest rate environment, which 
has made fiscal consolidation much easier in 
recent years. However, the extremely low inter -
est rates should not be considered as some -
thing permanent. Although this relief is likely to 
continue for some time, not least in cases 
where longer average fixed-  interest periods 
have been agreed, high levels of debt ultim -
ately make it considerably more difficult to Further conver -
gence of fiscal 
positions of the 
individual 
federal  states 
desirableLow interest 
rates not to be 
regarded as 
something that 
will go on for 
everitems, such as debt assumptions and debt 
relief.
Results for the off- budget entities should be 
reported in accordance with the current list 
of such entities published by the Federal 
Statistical Offi   ce. Taking these into account 
brings the balance more closely into line 
with the national accounts and provides a 
more comprehensive picture.
The expected overall balances are signifi  -
cant for the local governments of a federal 
state. This concerns, fi  rst, their effect on the 
general government balance. Second, in 
combination with information on the vol-
ume of cash advances, an assessment can 
be made of whether a tense fi  nancial situ-
ation at local governments poses a risk for 
future state government budgets.
For the European rules, a federal state’s ex-
pected contribution to the general govern-ment structural defi  cit as defi  ned in the na-
tional accounts is important. Therefore, a 
structural balance that is consistent with 
the national accounts should also be re-
ported for the individual states using the 
EU’s cyclical adjustment method. The Fed-
eral Ministry of Finance could make the cyc-
lical impact available on the basis of the 
method applied there. It would then be 
easier to assess whether the general gov-
ernment defi  cit might come into confl  ict 
with the structural ceiling of 0.5% of GDP .
In order to monitor compliance with the fed-
eral states’ respective debt brake, the individ-
ual states would, as a rule, have to provide 
further supplementary information. This in-
cludes the expected margin to the state- 
specifi  c debt brake ceiling. Data on the cyc-
lical components considered would also be 
vital. This will make it possible to assess over 
the long term whether the symmetry require-
ment of the German Basic Law has been met.

combine sound fiscal policy with good public 
services as soon as monetary policy returns to 
normal.
In the medium term, the reform of the state 
government revenue-  sharing scheme means 
that state government budgets will, from 2020 
onwards, be significantly strengthened to the 
detriment of central government.38 At the 
same time, however, the special funds for infra -
structure reconstruction in eastern Germany 
and the funds paid by central government to 
offset the cutback in mixed financing in 2006 
will be discontinued. Therefore, some federal 
states are likely to be in only a slightly better 
position than they are now.
However, the Federal Government is planning 
to transfer further funding to the federal states. 
The aim is to significantly increase mixed finan -
cing again. New grants are being earmarked 
for investment in schools, childcare, transport 
projects and social housing. Furthermore, cen -
tral government is also promising to contribute 
financially to addressing the legacy debt prob -
lems of many local governments. The planned 
mixed financing obscures the link between 
public services and their actual costs. It is also 
becoming apparent that responsibility for pub -
lic services and for any problems that may arise 
in this context is not clearly discernible. Experi -
ence has shown that such a situation is not 
conducive to an efficient use of funds and an 
effective performance of tasks.
The new projects represent a departure again 
from the objectives of the reform of the finan -
cial constitution in 2006. The reform was de -
signed to make state governments more self-  
reliant in their decision- making in terms of the 
services they provide and also force them to 
take greater account of the associated costs. 
This was intended to strengthen their individual 
responsibility. Suitable key figures would be im -
portant for a comparison of the different ap -
proaches adopted by the individual federal 
states. These are, in some cases, already avail -
able in the field of education, for example. For all their limitations, these indicators do provide 
additional, structured information for identify -
ing promising approaches (best practices). This 
could enhance the efficiency of Germany’s fed -
eral structure.
It might also make sense to grant state govern -
ments greater discretionary powers on the rev -
enue side as well. This might include, say, in -
come tax surcharges that can be set individu -
ally at the state level.39 To the extent that there 
are marked differences in preferences regard -
ing the nature and scope of public services, 
state government policy can respond to them 
more precisely. The debt brake means that bor -
rowing is not available as an option, and any 
need for adjustment falls largely on the ex -
penditure side at present. Greater revenue au -
tonomy would also make clear to the general 
public the connection between public services 
and their funding, while greater involvement of 
central government obscures it.
Looking ahead, demographic developments 
will place a further burden on state govern -
ment budgets. For example, tax revenue will 
increase more slowly, while spending on civil 
servants’ pension benefits will grow dispropor -
tionately, at least up to the middle of the next 
decade. This is due, in particular, to the fact 
that the number of civil servants was expanded 
significantly in the past, especially in the case of 
teachers in response to growing numbers of 
pupils. Furthermore, life expectancy is increas -
ing, which means that civil servants will be

for the federal states is also being afforded by the impend -
ing back- transfer of turnover tax funds by central govern -
ment (just over €2 billion), as the debts of the “German 
Unity Fund” are fully funded in formal terms. The fact that 
the increased share of local business tax (€3½ billion) will 
no longer have to be transferred to western German state 
governments, on the other hand, will ease the burden on 
local government. Individual federal states could offset this 
to the benefit of their budgets.

age remains unchanged. There are parallels 
here with the statutory pension insurance 
scheme. It therefore appears appropriate to 
also link the retirement age of civil servants to 
increasing life expectancy levels. At the same 
time, this would at least go some way towards 
easing a situation where demographic develop -
ments are likely to make it more difficult to re -
cruit new staff.
To provide for the foreseeable large civil servant 
pension obligations, the federal states have 
been setting aside pension reserves and funds 
over the past two decades. In doing so, they 
pursued very different approaches. Generally 
speaking, it is appropriate to recognise the 
additional pension burdens associated with the 
employment of civil servants on an accruals 
basis in the current budgets. A systematic pro -
vision also seems prudent. Nevertheless, the 
accumulation of reserves of late has arguably 
been geared more to the current budgetary 
situation. The obligations which have already 
accrued are far from being covered. It is scarcely 
possible to estimate how far the earmarked 
funds are supposed to cover expenditure in in -
dividual years. To enhance transparency, regu -
lar harmonised civil servant pension reports 
would be desirable. These would need to be 
presented at agreed points in time. Of interest 
here are the expected future expenditure paths, 
as well as the financial provisions and their in -
tended use.
Moreover, many federal states still have the 
imple mentation of the debt brake into state 
legis lation on their agendas. The approaches 
specified so far differ quite considerably in 
some cases (see the box on pp.  40 to  47). 
Above all, there are major differences in terms 
of cyclical adjustment procedures, the inclusion 
of financial transactions and off-  budget en -
tities, as well as the point of reference (net bor -
rowing or deficit).In terms of design, the crucial factor is to ef -
fectively safeguard the constitutional objective 
of a consistent limit on debt and the European 
fiscal rules. It is therefore essential to take ac -
count of off- budget entities and remove finan -
cial transactions as defined in the national ac -
counts. Where cyclical effects are left aside, the 
adjustment methods used must not allow any 
structural build- up of debt, as stipulated by the 
Basic Law. Exemptions for emergency situ -
ations would have to be defined as clearly as 
possible and backed by effective repayment 
rules. However, even if the debt brakes are de -
signed quite strictly, it cannot be ruled out that 
debt will increase, contrary to the intention of 
the debt brakes, when the budget is imple -
mented. In this case, there should be a require -
ment for state government to reduce any 
newly accrued debt according to a fixed set of 
rules if certain thresholds are exceeded. In any 
case, fiscal planning and developments should 
be modelled in such a way that allows compli -
ance with the rules to be controlled effectively. 
To this end, the relevant calculations and key 
figures should be both comprehensible and 
presented transparently.
The Stability Council has a key role to play in 
budgetary surveillance. In addition to its exist -
ing tasks, it will examine compliance with the 
respective debt brakes in future. To achieve 
this, information which is more extensive than 
that available at present is necessary. This 
would also have to be published so that the 
general public can understand this surveillance 
process (see the box on pp. 34 to 37). At the 
time of auditing, central and state governments 
should present updated estimates for the cur -
rent year and the medium term. These should 
contain the information needed to assess po -
tential conflicts with the European or national 
rules.… only partially

Implementing the debt brake in the federal states
The debt brake limits structural new bor-
rowing by central government to 0.35% of 
gross domestic product (GDP) in accord-
ance with Article 115 of Germany’s Basic 
Law (Grundgesetz). Legislation implement-
ing the debt brake entered into effect in the 
2011 fi  scal year. As for the state govern-
ment budgets, Article 109(3) of the Basic 
Law generally prohibits the federal states 
from (structural) new borrowing as from 
the year 2020.1 Any exceptions need to be 
addressed by state law, and they are not 
permitted to undermine the intention of 
the debt brake.
To date, the debt brake has been enshrined 
in the state constitutions of eight federal 
states (Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, 
Mecklenburg- West Pomerania, Rhineland- 
Palatinate, Saxony and Schleswig- Holstein), 
though the relevant legislation does still 
need to be fl  eshed out in some instances. 
Five other states (Baden- Württemberg, 
Lower Saxony, North Rhine- Westphalia, 
Saxony- Anhalt and Thuringia) have not (yet) 
amended their constitutions, but they have 
updated their state budgetary acts. Here 
again, there are some states which have still 
not enacted any rules to implement the 
debt brake. Berlin, Saarland and Branden-
burg have not made any arrangements 
under state law to date. That said, both 
Berlin and Saarland are currently subject to 
administrative agreements in connection 
with the consolidation assistance they are 
receiving.2 These agreements are there to 
prepare Berlin and Saarland to comply with 
the debt brake as from 2020, and they were 
designed specifi  cally with the debt brake in 
mind.
Target variable: new borrowing or fi  scal 
balance
In the vast majority of cases, the debt rules 
which the federal states have implemented so far refer to net borrowing.3 Only 
Schleswig- Holstein and – by virtue of the 
link to the administrative agreement in con-
nection with the consolidation assistance 
running until the end of 2019  – Bremen 
and, up to the end of 2018, Rhineland- 
Palatinate have debt rules that are geared 
to the fi  scal balance. Unlike net borrowing, 
the fi  scal balance does not change when 
reserves are replenished or drawn down. 
This is consistent with the European fi  scal 
rules, which use the fi  scal balance as de-
fi  ned in the national accounts as their point 
of reference. What makes the debt brake 
more diffi   cult to comply with in this case is 
that unused budgetary scope cannot be 
carried forward (in the form of reserves) to 
future periods.4
Reserves are becoming an increasingly im-
portant budgetary instrument for the state 
governments. Mecklenburg- West Pomer-
ania reported the highest per capita stock 
of reserves, at almost €1,000 (see the over-
view on pp. 44 ff.).5 The highest volume in 
absolute terms, meanwhile, was reported 
by Bavaria, at just over €6 billion, or €470 
per capita. Other federal states such as 
North Rhine- Westphalia have no general re-
serves to speak of.6
1 Here, and in the remainder of this box, this means 
net new borrowing. Therefore, rolling over maturing 
debt instruments continues to be permitted.
2 Similar agreements are in place for Bremen, Saxony- 
Anhalt and Schleswig- Holstein.
3 At the central government level, net borrowing is 
considered for the core budget, and the fi  scal balance 
for the off- budget entities consolidated under the debt 
brake.

Adjusting budgets for cyclically induced 
revenue growth
The Basic Law allows exceptions to be 
made from the debt ban, with the federal 
states having the scope to make their own 
individual arrangements. This includes the 
ability to adjust their budgets symmetrically 
to allow for cyclical effects. That is to say, 
they are permitted to borrow as a way of 
bridging cyclically induced defi  cits they 
incur during weak spells, provided similarly 
sized surpluses are generated when condi-
tions improve to repay the debt. Thus far, 
cyclical adjustment methods have been 
adopted and published by eight federal 
states. One feature all these methods have 
in common is that they use tax revenue to 
measure cyclical effects. In other respects 
they vary substantially, so they each have 
their own set of advantages and draw-
backs.7
Hesse and Schleswig- Holstein have opted 
for a method that is much like the one used 
by central government. Similar methods are 
used in connection with the consolidation 
assistance schemes, where an estimated 
aggregate output gap is the starting point 
used during budget planning to determine 
the cyclical component. When measuring 
this gap, it is assumed that the ratio to the 
cyclical component of tax revenue is fi  xed. 
Positive output gaps are an indication of 
good economic conditions (overutilisation), 
while negative gaps show that the situation 
is poor. If tax revenue deviates from the 
budgeted data over time right up to budget 
outturn, these deviations are also con-
sidered cyclical (except where they can be 
traced back to legislative changes). To en-
sure that positive and negative cyclical ef-
fects balance out over time, it makes sense 
to record all the cyclical effects identifi  ed on 
a cyclical control account, as is done in the 
state of Hesse, for instance. If the amount 
of debt posted on this account reaches a 
fairly high level over a longer period of 
time, the structural budgetary position was assessed as being better on average than it 
actually is. This happens because the debt 
which was thought to have been cyclically 
induced (and was thus allowed) was not 
automatically paid down out of cyclically in-
duced surpluses. That is why a threshold 
value needs to be set for the cyclical control 
account above which debt reduction fol-
lows a rule- based procedure.
The federal states of Baden- Württemberg, 
Hamburg, Mecklenburg- West Pomerania, 
Rhineland- Palatinate, Saxony and Thuringia, 
meanwhile, have opted to apply tax- 
smoothing methods rather than a mechan-
ism linked to the output gap. Under these 
methods, the cyclical component is the dif-
ference between tax revenue and a “normal 
level” of tax revenue. This normal level of 
tax revenue, which is adjusted for changes 
in legislation, is determined in different 
ways. Baden- Württemberg and Rhineland- 
Palatinate identify their normal values by se-
lecting a starting year for which economic 
conditions were assumed to be normal. The 
tax revenue collected in this starting year is 
then carried forward at a trend growth rate 
which is updated annually. Hamburg deter-
mines its trend level using an econometric 
method which assumes a constant rate of 
trend growth (tax trend method group). Tax 
trend methods tend to generate smoother 
cyclically adjusted tax revenue levels than 
those linked to the output gap. However, if 
the actual rate of trend growth deterior-
ates, there is a risk that there might be no 
need for the state government to respond 
promptly. The danger then is that structural 
defi  cits might be permitted (wrongly) as 
cyclically induced developments, and an 
additional persistent debt might build up. 
Targeted trend adjustments would there-
fore appear to be necessary to address this 
problem. The essence of this idea is an-
chored in the method used in Rhineland- 
7 For details, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Federal states’ 
cyclical adjustment in the context of the debt brake,

41

Palatinate, where the cyclical components 
are monitored on a control account. If the 
control account reaches substantial nega-
tive levels, there is a mechanism which 
automatically reduces the trend growth 
rates.
The tax- smoothing methods applied in 
Mecklenburg- West Pomerania, Saxony and 
Thuringia determine the normal level using 
the average level of tax revenue in multiple 
previous years (tax level method). However, 
if GDP and thus tax revenue increase over 
time (as they normally do), the use of past 
data as a point of reference will result in the 
normal levels determined being too low. As 
a result, for the most part, excessively high 
positive cyclical effects would be identifi  ed. 
These can be used for additional expend-
iture as long as they do not run up any 
debt, no repayments need to be made on 
loans borrowed earlier, and no reserves 
have to be replenished. High levels of re-
serves and safety margins are especially im-
portant under these methods because of 
the very tight constraints applied to cyclic-
ally induced borrowing.
Adjusting budgets for fi  nancial 
transactions 
Transactions are deemed to be “fi  nancial 
transactions” when fi  nancial assets are real-
ised or acquired. These transactions do not 
change the net stock of fi  nancial assets, nor 
do they accrue to the fi  scal balance as de-
fi  ned in the national accounts, which is the 
point of reference for the European budget-
ary surveillance procedure. The state gov-
ernments are free to choose whether and 
how they adjust their key budgetary pos-
ition for the debt brake to allow for fi  nan-
cial transactions.
To date, only Baden- Württemberg, Bremen, 
Hamburg, Hesse, Rhineland- Palatinate and 
Schleswig- Holstein make adjustments for fi  -
nancial transactions. For the most part, they 
make allowances for acquisitions and re-ductions of equity interests or loans as well 
as repayments and borrowing in the public 
sector. What this sometimes means, how-
ever, is that assumptions of losses and cap-
ital injections at enterprises with no pro-
spect of distributing any profi  ts in the future 
will also be included. These cases do not 
constitute fi  nancial transactions in the na-
tional accounts, however, and rightly so; in-
stead, they are posted as capital transfers 
and thus affect the fi  scal balance. The state 
governments ought to do likewise in order 
to comply with the objective of the debt 
brake, which is to avoid structural increases 
in debt without corresponding additions to 
the stock of fi  nancial assets. Starting in 
2019, Rhineland- Palatinate will be following 
the approach used in the national accounts, 
at least in some respects (just like central 
government), in that drawn down guaran-
tees will not be deducted as fi  nancial trans-
actions. Like the national accounts, Hesse 
captures debt relief as regular expenditure 
items, with the result that the budgetary 
scope is reduced.
New borrowing in emergencies
Further exemptions from the debt brake 
rules are possible by adopting contingency 
clauses. These clauses can be activated in 
the event of natural disasters or exceptional 
emergency situations which escape govern-
ment control and impact signifi  cantly on 
the state’s fi  nancial situation. However, bor-
rowing is only ever permitted in circum-
stances like these if it is linked to a repay-
ment schedule.
The federal states’ rules for contingency 
borrowing differ in a number of respects, 
including the voting majorities which are re-
quired in the state parliament.8 These range 
from a simple majority of the votes cast 
8 It does not seem appropriate here to modify the ma-
jority requirements enshrined in the state constitution 
by passing a set of sub- constitutional implementation 
acts.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

(in  North Rhine- Westphalia, Rhineland- 
Palatinate and Thuringia) to a two- thirds 
majority of mandates (in Hesse, Saxony and 
Schleswig- Holstein). In Mecklenburg- West 
Pomerania, a situation is only given emer-
gency status above a specifi  c threshold 
value. Yet, at less than 1% of the budget 
volume in recent years, this does appear to 
be a fairly low hurdle.9 So far, Hesse, Sax-
ony and Thuringia are the only federal 
states to articulate both an obligation and a 
clearer time schedule for scaling back funds 
raised under these contingency clauses.
Including off- budget entities
According to the wording of Article 109(3) 
of the Basic Law, the debt brake relates to 
borrowing by central and state govern-
ment. The transitional provisions set forth in 
Article 143d make it clear, at least for cen-
tral government, that its separate special 
funds (off- budget entities) also need to be 
included.10 This arrangement does not 
apply as such to the state governments be-
cause they might still have the option of 
setting up off- budget entities equipped 
with borrowing authorisations during the 
transitional period. However, Article 109(2), 
which precedes the subsection anchoring 
the debt brake in the Basic Law, clearly 
states that the European fi  scal rules must be 
complied with. It is reasonable to assume, 
then, that the state governments should 
likewise include their off- budget entities.11
The bulk of the federal states appear to 
have plans to stop granting borrowing au-
thorisations to off- budget entities, in a 
move that is seen as satisfying the debt 
brake rule. This step does not suffi   ce for the 
general government defi  cit ceiling, however 
– if off- budget entities are funded upfront, 
there is a possibility that the ceiling will be 
breached when the funds are drawn down 
at a later date.12 The latter would be a case 
for including off- budget entities in the debt 
brake rules. But at a minimum, the balances of off- budget entities need to be added to 
the ongoing surveillance process.
Control account during budget 
execution 
There is always a possibility that the debt 
brake will be adhered to during planning, 
but not in budget execution.13 To prevent 
this from driving up debt levels, a number 
of federal states have set up control ac-
counts (just like central government). This 
account shows how far net borrowing has 
deviated from the debt brake ceiling at 
budget outturn. If this account exceeds a 
threshold value, an adjustment will nor-
mally be made by lowering the borrowing 
ceiling in the next budget.14 The federal 
states’ control accounts differ primarily in 
terms of their threshold values. In Rhineland- 
Palatinate, the threshold is set at 15% of tax 
revenue in normal cyclical conditions, while 
in Hesse and Schleswig- Holstein it is 5%.
9 However, what this also means in an emergency is 
that fi  scal burdens of this amount or less cannot be 
covered by borrowing.
10 If at all, only borrowing authorisations issued be-
fore 2011 may still be used here.
11 Central government has been counting off- budget 
entities newly established since 2011 which are recipi-
ents of funding contributions from the core budget 
towards the debt brake. In compliance with the Euro-
pean fi  scal rules, the fi  scal balance is included for these 
entities. As a result, the advance funding does not cur-
tail the budgetary scope under the debt brake rules, 
because the core budget is charged and the institution 
obtaining the funding receives the same amount of 
relief . Only when the funds fl  ow out of the off- budget 
entity is the budgetary scope curtailed. Bearing this in 
mind, such pre- funded central government off- budget 
entities are viewed in a more positive light under the 
European fi  scal rules than reserves.
12 See also the box on p. 32.
13 There is broader scope for borrowing during this 
phase, not only for central government.
14 In most cases, there is no need to reduce borrow-
ing in adverse cyclical conditions, the idea here being 
to avoid any consolidation measures which have a pro-
cyclical effect.Deutsche Bundesbank

The macroeconomic impact of uncertainty
The question as to the consequences of heightened uncertainty has been increasingly pushed to 
centre stage in economic policy discourse in connection with the global recession of 2008-09 and 
the European sovereign debt crisis. Yet with regard to other events, too, such as the referendum 
on the United Kingdom remaining in the EU or parliamentary elections followed by difficulties in 
the formation of new governments, political uncertainty is regularly diagnosed as potentially 
being capable of impairing economic activity. Similar outcomes are also attributed to financial 
market turmoil and heightened uncertainty concerning the economic outlook. Against this back -
ground, this raises the question as to whether uncertainty is having a systematic impact on 
macroeconomic developments. Despite numerous explanatory approaches, it has proved chal -
lenging to demonstrate the existence of such an effect.
One reason is that there is no generally accepted measure of uncertainty. While some approaches 
focus on the political environment and evaluate the relevant information, others look at the vola -
tility of financial market variables, the dispersion of survey results or the forecastability of key 
economic variables. Depending on the underlying approach, conventional measures of uncer -
tainty can produce different findings. A comparison of selected measures of uncertainty in the 
euro area shows, in some cases, considerable discrepancies. These differences carry over to the 
estimated relationship between uncertainty and macroeconomic developments.
Details of econometric modelling likewise play a meaningful role in adequately capturing the 
macroeconomic consequences of uncertainty shocks. Different findings can be reached depend -
ing on how the estimation approach is specified. In addition, it is often very difficult to tell uncer -
tainty shocks apart from other shocks that operate in a similar manner, such as financial shocks, 
for instance.
Over the observation period, even despite the aforementioned difficulties, the existence of statis -
tically significant relationships between uncertainty shocks and the euro- area real economy can 
be proven. During the global financial and economic crisis of 2008-09, in particular, uncertainty 
weighed perceptibly on output. In the more recent past, however, there has been no evidence 
that uncertainty shocks have dampened macroeconomic activity.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background
Over the past ten years, the question as to the 
consequences of heightened uncertainty for 
macroeconomic developments has been shifted 
increasingly towards centre stage in economic 
policy discourse. The global financial and eco -
nomic crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt 
crisis in the euro area were key reasons for this. 
In particular, the considerable economic tur -
moil during the crisis years and the sluggish 
economic recovery –  compared with earlier 
cycles – were regarded as a consequence of 
heightened uncertainty. The tensions visible in 
the financial markets in the aftermath of the 
Brexit referendum and the concerns aired prior 
to a number of significant parliamentary elec -
tions in Europe about their outcome have 
stoked interest in the aggregate costs of 
heightened uncertainty.
In principle, there are many conceivable trans -
mission channels through which uncertainty 
can impact adversely on output.1 One of these 
channels, for instance, is sluggish investment or 
consumption patterns. Investment is often very 
difficult to reverse or is even irreversible. This 
can prompt firms to delay investment expend -
itures amidst heightened uncertainty in order 
to make better- informed decisions at a later 
date.2 Households may behave similarly with 
regard to the purchase of durable consumer 
goods.3 Increased precautionary saving on the 
part of households can also exert a negative 
macroeconomic impact owing to the attendant 
cutback in consumer spending.4 Moreover, 
specific forms of performance- based executive 
compensation can lead to increased caution 
and thus hesitancy regarding investment deci -
sions in times of heightened uncertainty.5 
Uncertainty- induced financial market responses 
such as rising risk premiums and a credit crunch 
can also dampen real economic growth.6 
Against this background, the question presents 
itself as to how much uncertainty shocks have 
weighed on output growth in the euro area 
over the past few years.Approaches to capturing 
uncertainty 
An assessment of the macroeconomic impact of 
uncertainty is predicated on properly capturing 
this factor. Although theory goes some way 
towards  defining the concept of uncertainty, es -
pecially setting it apart from risk, where probabil -
ities can be assigned to a set of potential out -
comes,7 and surprises as forecast errors,8 there is 
no unique, clear- cut measure. Conventional un -
certainty indicators therefore generally do not 
follow such a strict separation, but are often a 
combination of uncertainty, risk, and in particular 
cases, surprise.9 In addition, the individual meas -Heightened

ures are, in some cases, conceptually consider -
ably different, in terms of both the method of 
calculating the indicators and also the data used.
The time-  varying volatility of financial market 
data is a conventional measure for approximat -
ing uncertainty. Examples include the volatility 
of stock market indices derived from options 
prices and the implied volatility of exchange 
rates calculated from foreign exchange op -
tions.10 This rests on the assumption that op -
tion prices contain meaningful information 
about market participants’ perception of risk.
The dispersion of future expectations repre -
sents an additional frequently used measure of 
uncertainty. This approach rests on the assump -
tion that the dispersion of market agents’ or 
analysts’ forecasts increases with rising uncer -
tainty, whereas a low degree of uncertainty 
leads to a more uniform picture of expect -
ations.11 Standard reference variables include 
growth of real gross domestic product (GDP), 
consumer price inflation and the change in 
manufacturing output.12
Another widespread approach is to use media 
coverage analysis to capture uncertainty ten -
dencies.13 For example, a popular indicator of 
economic policy uncertainty measures the fre -
quency with which major daily newspapers re -
port on it. Newspaper articles are searched at 
fixed intervals for keywords or combinations of 
terms referring to this type of uncertainty. A 
measure of uncertainty is then derived from the 
intensity of reporting.
One general criticism of the uncertainty meas -
ures listed above is that the underlying data set 
is usually small, which calls their suitability into 
question. Another is that these measures do 
not always make a clear distinction between 
forecastable developments and developments 
that actually have to be regarded as unex -
pected. As a case in point, the dispersion of 
future expectations might reflect different, 
albeit  certain (e.g. sector or firm- specific) ex -
pectations. The volatility of financial market variables – owing, for example, to changes in 
risk aversion or market participants’ senti -
ment – can also increase without being attrib -
utable to uncertainty surrounding the possible 
realisation of macroeconomic fundamentals. 
Such indicators therefore run counter to a 
widely held opinion that uncertainty is linked to 
the limited ability to forecast future events.14 
Against the background of these two criticisms, 
more recent studies recommend deriving un -
certainty indicators from the volatility of esti -
mation errors resulting from the forecasting of 
a broad selection of business cycle- relevant 
time series and financial market data.15 The 
fluctuation intensity of forecast errors deter -
mines the degree of uncertainty here.16Conventional

15 This measure of uncertainty is calculated in three steps. 
The first step is, using a factor model approach, to estimate 
the forecastable components of the underlying macroeco -
nomic time series. Given the resultant forecast errors, a sto -
chastic volatility model is employed in a second step to 
derive the individual uncertainty attributable to the respect -
ive macroeconomic time series, being captured by the con -
ditional volatility of the forecast error. In the final step, the 
measure for macroeconomic uncertainty is determined by 
aggregating time- series- specific uncertainty. For a detailed 
description of the methodology, see K. Jurado, S. C. Ludvig -
son and S. Ng (2015), op. cit.

Development of uncertainty 
indicators for the euro area 
over time
Further analysis is based on four uncertainty 
indi cators for the euro area. These comprise 
an indicator  for economic policy uncertainty,17 
measures referring to the volatility of the stock 
market,18 the dispersion of production expect -
ations in manufacturing19 and a proxy of 
macroeconomic uncertainty based on the 
volatil ity of the non- forecastable component of 
cyclically relevant indicators.20Over the period under review, it becomes ap -
parent that, except for the economic policy un -
certainty indicator, all of the measures of un -
certainty reached their peak during the global 
financial crisis of 2008-09. Although the eco -
nomic policy uncertainty indicator rose during 
the crisis, it hit its peak in 2016 during the 
month in which the United Kingdom voted on 
whether to remain in the European Union.21 In 
the months that followed, too, movements in 
the economic policy uncertainty index deviated 
from developments in the other measures of 
uncertainty. While economic policy uncertainty 
tended to hover at well above average levels, 
uncertainty in the euro area as indicated by the 
other measures remained relatively low on the 
whole as the economic recovery proceeded.22

area is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the measures 
for Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Depending on the 
country in question, the calculation comprises between 
122 and 139 time series, including cyclical indicators, sur -
vey data, financial market series as well as prices and ex -
change rates. For a detailed description of the index con -

21 The indicators show further periods of heightened un -
certainty in the euro area following the terrorist attacks in 
the United States on 11 September 2001, the Iraq war in 
2003 (predominantly stock market volatility, economic pol -
icy and macroeconomic uncertainty), the European sover -
eign debt crisis and the recent US presidential election (the 
indicator of economic policy uncertainty only).
22 This is particularly true of the indicator for macroeco -
nomic uncertainty, which has remained below its long- term 
average since October 2012.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2018  
52

The unique behaviour of the indicator for eco -
nomic policy uncertainty can also be seen in a 
simple correlation analysis. While implied stock 
market volatility, the dispersion of expectations 
and macroeconomic uncertainty as measured 
by forecast error volatility are fairly closely cor -
related, the same can only be said of economic 
policy uncertainty to a limited extent. In com -
bination with the macroeconomic uncertainty 
indicator, it even gives rise to a negative correl -
ation coefficient, albeit a statistically insignifi -
cant one. Stock market volatility and the 
macroeconomic uncertainty indicator exhibit 
an especially pronounced positive relationship.
All of the uncertainty indicators nevertheless 
display a negative relationship with respect to 
aggregate growth. The simple correlation co-
efficient with the quarterly GDP growth rate 
proves to be statistically significant for each of 
the indicators. The negative correlation meas -
ured using this method is particularly notice -
able for the dispersion of expectations, while it 
is relatively weak for economic policy uncer -
tainty.Quantification of uncertainty 
effects for the euro area
Simple correlations can provide broad indica -
tions of relationships between economic time 
series. To analyse the macroeconomic effects 
of uncertainty in greater depth, two classes of 
models are commonly used in applied eco -
nomic research. In addition to microfounded 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models 
(see also the box on pp. 54 ff.), structural vector 
autoregression models (SVAR models) are fre -
quently employed. In these multi- equation 
models, a vector of selected endogenous vari -
ables is first regressed on its own lags. An esti -
mated multi-  dimensional linear equation sys -
tem such as this can capture the dynamic rela -
tionships between a large number of key 
macroeconomic variables. The residual values 
of the various individual equations are then 
used to identify the drivers of the model – the 
structural shocks. The aim is to observe the im -
pact of these disturbances on the system in 
isolation and to estimate their relative import -
ance.
Identifying these shocks requires additional as -
sumptions derived, inter alia, from economic 
theory. The recursive identification method as -
sumes, for example, that certain shocks initially 
have a delayed impact on selected variables … sometimes

equilibrium models (DSGE models) have be-
come a standard tool in quantitative macro-
economics. This type of model typically at-
tempts to explain macroeconomic develop-
ments based on individual optimal decision 
rules of rational economic agents.1 In these 
models, the cyclical dynamics of the econ-
omy are induced by a variety of unexpected 
disturbances (referred to as shocks).
The fi  rst generation of DSGE models was 
kept relatively simple, but methodological 
refi  nements and greater computing power 
have expanded their modelling possibil-
ities.2 As a result of these developments, it 
is also possible to explore the macroeco-
nomic effects of uncertainty using DSGE 
models. One of the advantages here over 
other modelling strategies (such as struc-
tural vector autoregressive models) is the 
ability to map specifi  c transmission chan-
nels in detail.
In DSGE models, uncertainty shocks are 
often captured as unexpected changes in 
the variance of selected disturbances3, 
whereby frictions are of key importance to 
the macroeconomic effects of uncertainty 
shocks. Besides nominal and real rigidities, 
these include fi  nancial market imperfec-
tions, in particular.4
Depending on which frictions are taken into 
account, there can sometimes be clear dif-
ferences in the quantifi  cation of uncertainty 
effects. This also applies to key macroeco-
nomic variables such as output and price 
developments, which are of special interest 
from a monetary policy perspective.
It is true that the direction of the impact on 
aggregate output is largely undisputed – an increase in uncertainty generally has a 
dampening effect.5 That said, the effects of 
the adverse uncertainty shocks on output 
1 DSGE models typically assume that economic agents 
do not make any systematic errors when forming their 
expectations and that they make optimum use of all 
the information that is available to them. See also

ment costs for investment and employment can be

rigidities and uncertainty shocks. For information

5 In this context, several studies point to the increased 
impact of uncertainty shocks in periods with a binding 
zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate. More-
over, a binding zero lower bound in combination with 
conventional macroeconomic shocks, too, can lead to 
heightened uncertainty about macroeconomic devel-
opments. See also S. Basu and B. Bundick (2017), op.

shown in the DSGE simulations range from 
relatively small6 to clearly contractionary.7
When it comes to price developments, the 
direction of the impact is less clear cut. A 
number of analyses fi  nd that output and 
prices demonstrate unidirectional responses, 
as can also be observed for macroeconomic 
demand shocks.8 Other studies point to the 
possibility of opposite movements as a re-
sult of heightened uncertainty.9 In this con-
text, the result sometimes depends signifi  -
cantly on the assumptions about the con-
duct of monetary policy.10 In DSGE models, 
central bank policy is often described by a 
simple reaction function. The central bank 
adjusts the policy rate to movements in out-
put measures and deviations of the infl  ation 
rate from the target. The strength of the 
response usually also depends on a smooth-
ing parameter which is supposed to portray 
the preferences of the central bank in terms 
of interest rate stability.
Simulations using a prototypical DSGE 
model with imperfect competition and 
nominal rigidities confi  rm that the assumed 
degree of interest rate smoothing can play 
a key role in determining the direction of 
the impact of uncertainty shocks on the in-
fl  ation rate.11 If the central bank decides not 
to smooth interest rate fl  uctuations, aggre-
gate output and infl  ation respond to an un-
expected increase in uncertainty in the 
same direction, as is typical for demand 
shocks.12 In actual fact, however, empirical 
estimations usually point to comparatively 6 See B. Born and J. Pfeifer (2014), Policy risk and the

12 The direction in which the infl  ation rate moves fol-
lowing an uncertainty shock is the result of a combin-
ation of different forces. The decline in demand trig-
gered by an uncertainty shock puts downward pres-
sure on prices. This may be countered by the fact that 
fi  rms which are subject to heightened uncertainty can 
also have an incentive to increase prices. Although the 
expected variability of future shocks increases when 
uncertainty is greater, the direction of impact is un-
clear. If price adjustment costs go up in line with the 
strength of the price change and if a price that is set 
too low in comparison to competitors causes a greater 
loss of profi  ts than a price that is too high (convex 
price adjustment costs in combination with a concave 
profi  t function), prices may rise after an uncertainty 
shock. If the central bank reacts comparatively strongly 
to an uncertainty shock (no interest rate smoothing), 
the likelihood of high, cost- intensive future price ad-
justments decreases. In this case, the price dampening 
effect of uncertainty shocks therefore predominates.Effects of an uncertainty shock under

and do not cause any direct effects within that 
same period.23 In this identification strategy, it 
is not only the selected data frequency but also 
the order of the variables within the estimation 
model that determines how rapidly individual 
indicators react to certain disturbances over 
time.24
To obtain initial findings on the macroeconomic 
effects of uncertainty in the euro area, a recur -
sive SVAR model is estimated using two vari -
ables – one of the uncertainty indicators pre -
sented and industrial production (excluding the 
construction sector) as an indicator of real eco -
nomic activity.25 Here it is assumed that uncer -
tainty shocks can directly influence the level of 
uncertainty as well as the real economy. Out -
put also responds immediately to shocks in the 
real economy. These, however, only affect un -
certainty after a lag of one period. The assump -
tion of a lag of one period in the impact of real 
economic shocks on uncertainty can be justi -
fied for at least some of the measures of uncer -tainty employed on account of their backward- 
looking orientation when using monthly data.26 
The use of lower- frequency data series such as 
quarterly GDP would be more problematic 
under this assumption.27
The relevance of the identified shocks can be 
determined using impulse- response functions 
and a variance decomposition of the model’s Structural vector 
autoregression 
models …high degrees of interest smoothing.13 It is 
then also possible that output and prices 
move in opposite direc tions following un-
certainty shocks. However, especially in 
periods of severe macroeconomic distor-
tions, which are sometimes also character-
ised by a high degree  of uncertainty, inter-
est rate smoothing can be far less pro-
nounced.14 In these circumstances, it would 
also be conceivable that output and prices 
would respond in the same direction. This 
contradictory fi  nding is consistent with the 
inconclusive empirical evidence on the price 
effects  of uncertainty shocks (for details, 
see the box on pp. 60 ff.). 13 See R. Clarida, J. Gali and M. Gertler (1999), The

niques. A normal- inverse-  Wishart prior with a Minnesota 
structure is used as the prior distribution of the model par -

culated from the posterior distribution of the SVAR param -

imum time lag for the endogenous variables to be included 
in the SVAR model (lag order) is 12 periods. The individual 
model equations also contain deterministic components in 
the form of a constant. See F. Canova (2007), Methods for 
applied macroeconomic research, Princeton University 
Press.
29 Forecast error variance decomposition specifically 
shows what share of the forecast error variance for a spe -
cific forecast horizon of the model’s variables can be ex -
plained by the respective structural shock in the SVAR 
model. In the context of the impulse- response analysis, the 
SVAR system – assuming a state where all fundamental dis -
turbances in the model take on the value zero – is hit once 
with a structural shock amounting to one standard devi -
ation. The impulse- response function depicts the response 
of the model variables to this unexpected impulse over 
time. For a detailed description of the methodology, see,

not for economic policy uncertainty.30 There 
are also noticeable differences in terms of the 
magnitudes of the uncertainty shocks. Accord -
ing to the estimated impulse- response func -
tions, the decline in industrial production is 
much lower when the indicator for economic 
policy uncertainty is used compared to the 
other measures.
A similar picture emerges from a variance de -
composition of the forecast errors. While un -
certainty shocks do go a substantial way to -
wards explaining the fluctuations in industrial 
production in the euro area for three of the 
indicators, i.e. stock market volatility, the dis -persion of expectations and macroeconomic 
uncertainty, this is not the case for economic 
policy uncertainty.
Though a two- variable model can provide ini -
tial insights into the macroeconomic signifi -
cance of uncertainty shocks, a more precise 
quantification requires an expanded set of vari -
ables given the diverse ways in which economic 
variables interact. Therefore, a second econo -
metric model takes into account a stock index, 
a shadow short rate, the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices, the standardised unemploy -
ment rate and industrial production in the euro 
area in addition to one of the four measures of 
uncertainty.31
As in the two- variable model, it is assumed that 
uncertainty shocks have an immediate impact 
on all other variables.32 The variance decom -
position shows that including additional macro -
economic relationships typically reduces the 
estimated extent to which uncertainty shocks 
account for fluctuations in output.33 This de -
crease is particularly noticeable when measur -
ing uncertainty based on the dispersion of out -
put expectations. By contrast, the results for 
the macroeconomic uncertainty indicator prove 
relatively robust. Though the importance of un -

In “normal” periods, the shadow short rate matches the

indicator for stock market volatility is employed, 
they still have a relatively high level of explana -
tory power.
In a further review of the results, it is assumed 
that uncertainty shocks only have an effect on 
the remaining variables with a lag of one 
period.34 On balance, the explanations pro -
vided by uncertainty shocks across the entire 
forecast horizon are once again much lower 
than before. This is especially true when uncer -
tainty indicators geared towards stock market 
volatility and the dispersion of expectations are 
used. That said, uncertainty shocks do still ex -
plain a relatively large share of the fluctuations 
in industrial production when the indicator for 
macroeconomic uncertainty is deployed.
It is therefore evident that estimations of the 
macroeconomic impact of uncertainty shocks 
can produce very different results depending 
on the measure of uncertainty selected and the 
specification of the econometric model. Only 
the measure for macroeconomic uncertainty 
based on the volatility of forecast errors yields 
relatively robust results. These suggest a clear 
temporary impact of uncertainty on aggregate 
activity.
Isolating uncertainty shocks
When determining the macroeconomic impact 
of uncertainty shocks, it is particularly import -
ant to carefully separate these disturbances 
from other relevant shocks. In some cases, for 
instance, quantitative analyses point to mark -
edly similar real economic effects arising from 
an unexpected increase in uncertainty and 
from other typical negative macroeconomic 
shocks – such as adverse financial shocks.35 In 
this context, a precise identification is also im -
portant from a monetary policy perspective. 
This is demonstrated by a number of studies 
which indicate that an unexpected increase in 
uncertainty can impair the impact of conven -
tional monetary policy measures.36 For ex -
ample, any changes in firms’ price- setting be -haviour37 and in financial sector leverage38 trig-
gered by uncertainty can water down the ef -
fects of monetary policy on macroeconomic 
activity. Moreover, clearly identifying uncer -
tainty shocks may be relevant when assessing 
price dynamics (see the box on pp. 60 ff.).
With regard to the econometric framework 
used up until now, it is rather difficult to separ -
ate uncertainty shocks from financial shocks as 
they have a similar impact on macroeconomic 
variables and identifying assumptions regarding 
their lagged impact sometimes seem to be ar -
bitrary. Such models may therefore cause the 
macroeconomic consequences of heightened 
uncertainty to be misinterpreted.
Bearing all this in mind, identifying shocks on 
the basis of sign restrictions represents an alter -
native method of jointly capturing uncertainty 
and financial shocks in SVAR models.39 Under 
this approach, the signs derived from economic 
theory are imposed on the impulse response … the model

34 Uncertainty therefore now occupies the last position in 
the variable vector of the SVAR model. The lag in the im -
pact of uncertainty shocks specified in this model is justi -
fied, amongst other things, by the desire to achieve the 
most conservative possible quantification of uncertainty 
effects on the real economy. Similar approaches can be

The effects of uncertainty shocks on prices
Although the macroeconomic effects of un-
certainty shocks have been examined inten-
sively in the past few years, there are only a 
few empirical studies which deal with their 
price effects in more detail. Analyses based on 
micro- founded dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium models (DSGE models) show dis-
tinct effects of these shocks on macroeco-
nomic economic activity for the most part, 
but the direction of impact on prices is less 
clear. While part of the DSGE literature 
empha sises a co- movement of prices and 
real economic activity following unexpected 
changes in uncertainty,1 there are also argu-
ments suggesting that fi  rms might increase 
their prices in response to adverse uncertainty 
shocks.2 In this context, it must also be taken 
into account that assumptions made with 
regard  to the monetary policy reaction func-
tion can be crucial for the price effects (see 
comments on page 54 ff.).
An investigation of the effects of uncertainty 
shocks on prices requires that these disturb-
ances be isolated from other relevant struc-
tural shocks. A distinction is particularly chal-
lenging for the type of shocks that originate 
from the fi  nancial market, as these often turn 
out to have very similar macroeconomic 
effects . Moreover, the direction in which fi  -
nancial shocks move prices is likewise un-
clear.3
An empirical analysis of the price effects of 
uncertainty shocks is carried out here with the 
help of a structural vector autoregressive 
(SVAR) model. A setup with six variables is 
esti mated each for the United States and the 
euro area. It contains the log real gross do-
mestic product (GDP), the log Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), a shadow 
short rate as a measure of the monetary pol-
icy stance,4 a bank credit spread5 and a stress 
indicator for the fi  nancial system6 – in order to 
capture the situation in the fi  nancial mar-
kets – as well as a macroeconomic uncertainty measure.7 For availability reasons, the esti-
mates for the euro area are based on data for 
the period from the fi  rst quarter of 1999 to 
the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the United

both economic areas. The indicator measures the de-
gree of monetary policy accommodation when the 
policy rate is at the zero lower bound. Otherwise the 
shadow rate corresponds to the short- term interest 
rate. See L. Krippner (2013), Measuring the stance of

issued by euro area non- fi  nancial corporations and 
German government bonds (zero- coupon bonds) with 
a corresponding maturity (Gilchrist and Mojon, 2018).

In addition to the uncertainty shock, a fi  nan-
cial shock, an aggregate supply shock, an ag-
gregate demand shock and a monetary policy 
shock are identifi  ed in the model using sign 
restrictions. This identifi  cation approach is 
based on assumptions about the contempor-
aneous direction of the reaction of the vari-
ables to the shock in question, which gener-
ally stem from theoretical considerations. In 
this context, the structural shock must satisfy 
the following restrictions: A negative supply 
shock leads to a decline in GDP and an in-
crease in the price level and short- term inter-
est rate. By contrast, a negative demand 
shock leads to a reduction in GDP and a simi-
lar response by the consumer price index and 
shadow rate. Furthermore, an unexpected de-
cline in aggregate demand results in a con-
traction of the bank credit spread. A negative 
monetary policy shock implies that interest 
rates will go up and GDP and consumer prices 
will go down.9
Financial shocks and uncertainty shocks are 
assumed to heighten uncertainty and fi  nancial 
market stress and increase the gap between 
bank lending rates and long- term government 
bond yields. At the same time, they have a 
dampening effect on macroeconomic activity 
and monetary policy becomes more accom-
modative.10 Owing to the ambiguity of theor-etical results, the direction of impact on prices 
is not specifi  ed.11 The distinction between an 
8 In addition to the contemporaneous and lagged vari-
ables, the individual model equations of the SVAR sys-
tem each contain a constant. The lag order of the 
SVAR model is 5. The estimation is carried out using 
Bayesian methods. A normal- inverse Wishart prior with 
Minnesota structure is used, with the specifi  cation of 
hyperparameters in line with standard assumptions in 
the literature (see, inter alia, Canova, 2007). The imple-
mentation of sign restrictions is based on the algo-
rithm developed by Rubio- Ramírez et al. (2010). See 
F.  Canova (2007), Methods for Applied Macroeco-
nomic Research, Princeton University Press; J. F. Rubio- 
Ramírez, D. F. Waggoner and T. Zha (2010), Structural 
vector autoregressions: Theory of identifi  cation and 
algorithms for inference, The Review of Economic 
Studies 77 (2), pp. 665-696.
9 Sign restrictions are used to ensure that the residual 
shock of the six- variable model is differentiated from 
the structural disturbances. For a detailed description 
of the identifi  cation strategy, see P .  Meinen and 
O.  Röhe (2018), To sign or not to sign? On the re-
sponse of prices to fi  nancial and uncertainty shocks,

response to fi  nancial shocks, see Deutsche Bundes-
bank, The infl  uence of credit supply shocks on the de-
velopment of real GDP and lending to euro- area non- 
fi  nancial corporations, Monthly Report, September 
2015, pp. 36-38. Based on these assumptions, uncer-
tainty shocks and fi  nancial market shocks could result 
in a monetary policy response without this necessarily 
being required in terms of maintaining price stability. 
Such behaviour can be explained with a broader ap-
proach to monetary policy which incorporates the goal 
of fi  nancial market stability. The fact that a recent em-
pirical study stressed the importance of fi  nancial mar-
ket stress levels for monetary policy is consistent with 
this picture. See D. Caldara and E. Herbst (2018), Mon-

uncertainty shock and a fi  nancial shock is ul-
timately based on an assumption about the 
relative change in uncertainty and fi  nancial 
market stress. Here, an uncertainty shock is 
assumed to result in a stronger response by 
uncertainty relative to the stress indicator, 
whilst a fi  nancial market shock has a relatively 
stronger infl  uence on stress levels in the fi  nan-
cial market.12
The impulse response functions derived from 
the model fi  rst of all confi  rm that uncertainty 
shocks negatively impact macroeconomic ac-
tivity in both economic areas. In addition, out-
put responds in a fairly similar way to fi  nancial 
market shocks. By contrast, the response of 
prices is less clear. For the euro area, the me-
dian of the estimated impulse response func-
tions tends to suggest a co- movement of 
both shocks with GDP , but the wide disper-
sion of the results – as shown by the credible 
intervals13 – illustrates the high estimation un-
certainty associated with the price effects. In 
the case of the United States, the median 
price reaction even runs counter to the GDP response following an unexpected increase in 
uncertainty. Estimation inaccuracy is even 
more pronounced here, however, which 
means that in this scenario, too, the response 
is indistinguishable from zero. Overall, the re-
sults therefore suggest that the response of 
prices to uncertainty shocks is ambiguous in 
empirical terms.14
12 This separation of fi  nancial and uncertainty shocks 
follows the approach devised by Furlanetto et al. 
(2018) See F. Furlanetto, F. Ravazzolo and S. Sarferaz 
(2018), Identifi  cation of fi  nancial factors in economic 
fl  uctuations, The Economic Journal, forthcoming.
13 Credible intervals are the Bayesian counterpart to 
confi  dence intervals used in frequentist statistics.
14 Further estimates indicate that if, as often occurs in 
empirical applications, a co- movement of GDP and 
prices is restricted in response to fi  nancial and uncer-
tainty shocks, this can weaken the estimated role these 
disturbances play for real economic activity.Impact of an adverse uncertainty shock on macroeconomic activity and consumer prices

functions.40 To this end, an SVAR model is esti -
mated, in this instance at quarterly intervals, 
employing the indicator of macroeconomic un -
certainty, real GDP , the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices, a shadow short rate, a bank 
credit spread41 and a stress indicator for the fi -
nancial system.42 The estimations are based on 
the period from the first quarter of 1999 to the 
fourth quarter of 2017.43 Alongside a financial 
shock and an uncertainty shock, an aggregate 
supply shock, an aggregate demand shock, 
and a monetary policy shock are specified. All 
the above shocks are identified using contem -
poraneous sign restrictions, i.e. on the basis of 
assumptions regarding the direction of the re -
sponse of the model variables during the period 
when the shock occurs. The uncertainty shock 
is distinguished from a financial shock by means 
of the relative change in uncertainty and finan -
cial market stress.44 A detailed description of 
the identification strategy can be found in the 
box on pp. 60 ff.
The macroeconomic impact of uncertainty and 
financial shocks in the euro area in specific 
periods is gauged by undertaking a historical 
shock decomposition of quarterly real GDP 
growth rates.45 There is evidence that both un -
certainty shocks and financial shocks have in -
fluenced macroeconomic developments in the 
euro area during different periods. This is espe -
cially true of the global financial and economic 
crisis of 2008-09. In addition, the analysis sug -
gests that financial shocks also slowed GDP 
growth in the wake of the European sovereign 
debt crisis. Conversely, during this phase, un -
certainty shocks had no discernible macroeco -
nomic impact. Similarly, at the end of the 
period under review, in 2017, uncertainty was 
not observed to have had any detrimental ef -
fect on overall output in the euro area. In fact, 
GDP growth was noticeably boosted when the Uncertainty

Keynesian DSGE models. See F.  Furlanetto, F.  Ravazzolo

level of uncertainty unexpectedly decreased.46 
This finding is consistent with the observation 
of a favourable macroeconomic environment in 
the euro area.
Conclusion
The importance of uncertainty shocks for 
macroeconomic developments has attracted 
greater attention on the back of the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis. However, the task of 
assessing these effects has proved far from sim -
ple. One reason for this is the lack of a clear- cut 
measure of uncertainty, making it necessary to 
rely on approximations when performing em -
pirical analyses. What is more, the commonly 
used quantification methods have sometimes 
been known to respond sensitively to the se -
lected model specification. These points should 
be taken into account when analysing uncer -
tainty effects.
In the context of econometric studies, for ex -
ample, it has not been possible to identify any 
systematic impact on output in conjunction 
with a commonly used indicator of economic 
policy uncertainty – at least not for the euro area. Given the high degree of media interest 
in the indicator in question, this finding is re -
markable. This is not the case for the indicator 
used to gauge macroeconomic uncertainty, 
which is derived from the volatility of the fore -
cast errors of a plethora of macroeconomic 
time series. In the period under review, this in -
dicator reveals that uncertainty has a relatively 
robust negative impact on output.
Applying this indicator for the euro area, uncer -
tainty is shown to have had a pronounced im -
pact on the real economy over the period 
under review, especially during the financial 
and economic crisis. During the sovereign debt 
crisis, by contrast, financial shocks were of 
greater relevance. In the past few years, a 
period encompassing not just an array of im -
portant general election results, but also the 
Brexit referendum, the economic development 
in the euro area does not appear to have suf -
fered from any significant adverse uncertainty 
effects.Challenges

Activities of multinational enterprise groups 
and national economic statistics
The business activities of international enterprise groups present great challenges for national 
economic statistics. They became a focus of attention for economic analysis when Ireland’s gross 
domestic product (GDP) for 2015 was raised by one- quarter following a reorganisation of the 
division of labour within enterprise groups, even though the utilisation of labour and real installed 
capital in Ireland had not changed to any notable extent. This shows that GDP according to the 
national accounts methodology currently in place is not necessarily identical to the economic 
output generated by domestic labour and installed capital. For example, income from licenses, 
which serve to produce output abroad through the combination of labour and real installed 
capital  there, counts towards domestic product. In consequence, the organisational decisions 
taken by multinational enterprise groups for, say, tax optimisation purposes can lead to abrupt 
shifts in the allocation of value added between national economies, thereby triggering jumps in 
domestic product levels. This can make interpreting key macroeconomic indicators such as eco -
nomic growth, investment activity and productivity trends considerably more difficult.
The implications of the global economic activity of multinational enterprise groups are currently 
making themselves felt, above all, in small economies with a large share of such enterprises; but 
once they reach a certain scale, they can also have a tangible impact on the macroeconomic 
performance of larger economic areas. In 2015, for example, the events in Ireland led to a 
0.4 percentage point increase in the estimate of GDP growth for the euro area. Even greater 
changes were seen that year and in subsequent years, particularly in the recorded statistics of 
investments in the euro area. Influences of this kind are highly detrimental to economic analysis, 
which is therefore very much dependent on detailed information from the statistical offices.Deutsche Bundesbank

Growing global inter -
connectedness and official 
statistics
The global interconnectedness of economic ac -
tivity has accelerated considerably over the last 
three decades. Not only has trade in goods 
risen sharply; so, too, has the importance of 
cross-  border production and supply chains as 
well as the cross- border provision of financial 
and consultancy services. This has been attrib -
utable to political and institutional changes 
such as the growing liberalisation of inter -
national economic activity as a result, inter alia, 
of progress made by the World Trade Organiza -
tion or in connection with regional groupings 
such as the European Union (EU). Moreover, 
technological progress has drastically reduced 
communication and transport costs, which has 
facilitated a continual rise in the importance of 
enterprises that maintain production locations 
and subsidiaries in multiple countries or out -
source parts of production to legally independ -
ent enterprises abroad.1 This is particularly true 
of the EU, not least given the single market 
with its four basic freedoms. Multinational en -
terprise groups make major contributions to 
value added and employment in most EU Mem -
ber States.2
The cross- border activities of globally intercon -
nected enterprises present great challenges for 
national economic statistics.3 In essence, the 
objective of official statistics is to capture do -
mestic economic activity. However, multi -
national enterprise groups typically spread their 
activities among different countries. Given their 
complexity, it is often very difficult to allocate 
activities and transactions of multinational 
enter prise groups to specific national units.4 
Moreover, the structure and business oper -
ations of international networks are extremely 
diverse. Multinational enterprise groups do not 
operate solely on the basis of what is known as 
the horizontal or vertical division of labour.5 
Hybrid  forms are also selected depending on 
the institutional, tax or cost- related circum -
stances.6Recording the activities

included a more comprehensive description of

production processes, in particular with regard 
to the provision of knowledge- based services. 
Research and development expenditure of 
firms on own account for own use is no longer 
regarded as intermediate consumption, but is 
instead treated as investment in intellectual 
property products and allocated to the capital 
stock. The resident units to which certain tasks 
of multinational enterprise groups are allocated 
can now also include what are known as spe -
cial purpose entities or special purpose vehicles. 
Moreover, the principle of economic ownership 
is consistently brought to bear. The European

The definition of “resident units” is of key im -
portance when measuring the national value 
added contribution of multinational enterprise 
groups. It is these units that specific activities 
and transactions of the multinational enter -
prises are allocated to.8 A key requirement for 
such a unit is that it engages in economic activ -
ity on a significant scale over at least one year 
in the country in question. However, it need 
not be formally legally independent. Branches, 
offices or production facilities may also be re -
garded as resident in the economic sense.9 
Resident producers pursuant to the ESA 2010 
may also include what are referred to as special 
purpose entities or special purpose vehicles.10 
These are always formally subordinate to a 
larger company and in many cases they do not 
have significant staffing and lack production fa -
cilities. Thus, they do not usually meet the cri -
terion of independent economic activity. They 
are regarded as separate resident units, as they 
are subject to the law of their country of resi -
dence and not that of the parent company’s 
country of residence.11
A second central principle when allocating ac -
tivities to certain economic units is the owner -
ship principle. Transactions are allocated based 
on ownership rights “in the economic sense”. 
The economic owner according to the ESA 
2010 is the unit that is “entitled to claim the 
benefits associated with the use of the asset 
by virtue of accepting the associated risks”.12 
Thus, the economic ownership rights, which 
are of decisive importance for the national 
accounts , may deviate from the legal owner -
ship rights.13 In practice, however, the alloca -
tion of transactions is often likely to be based 
on business accounting, i.e. to take its bearings 
from the legal structures.14 It is therefore pos -
sible that activities carried out jointly by the 
units of a multinational enterprise are recorded 
separately although they would be recorded 
jointly under a different organisational struc -
ture.With regard to the definition of trade in goods 
in the national accounts, it follows from the 
ownership principle that imports and exports 
are defined as transactions where economic 
ownership is transferred between a resident 
and a non- resident unit.15 The objective of the 
national accounts statistics is to capture the in -
come streams between residents and non-  
residents. This is in line with the current ac -
counting rules of the balance of payments stat -

accounts standards, firms’ own-  account ex -
penditure on research and development is con -
sidered to be an investment alongside com -
puter programs, mineral exploration and liter -
ary or artistic originals, which were already in -
cluded in the ESA 1995, and is recognised as an 
intangible asset.17 Like other intangible assets, 
the results of firms’ own- account research and 
development can be protected with intellectual 
property rights. The outsourcing of such rights 
to units abroad18 is regarded as a cross- border 
transaction which reduces the domestic capital 
stock. Income from licences and the corres -
ponding value added is then also allocated to 
the units abroad.
Examples of cross- border 
economic  activity and how it is 
recorded in the current ESA
Following these principles, there are a number 
of particularities in recording the cross- border 
activities of multinational enterprise groups, as 
opposed to traditional trade.19 In the case of 
traditional trade, an enterprise with a domestic 
economic owner produces goods domestically 
with domestic production factors, possibly 
using intermediate goods (e.g. raw materials) 
from an enterprise abroad to which it is not le -
gally affiliated. When recorded in the national 
accounts, the proceeds from selling the goods 
abroad are allocated in full to domestic ex -
ports. Domestic value added is determined by 
deducting the cost of the imported intermedi -
ate goods from the export proceeds.
If a domestic enterprise of a multinational 
group outsources parts of the production pro -
cess abroad, economic ownership rights at the 
respective production stage determine how 
this is recorded. With a typical breakdown of 
the production chain, certain upstream activ -
ities, such as the development of new products 
and initial production steps, as well as down -
stream activities, such as the final assembly and 
marketing, remain with the head office, 
whereas the intermediary production stages are carried out by a subsidiary or an external   
enterprise abroad. If the economic owner of 
the goods to be processed changes in the 
course of the production process (i.e. where 
certain benefits and risks are transferred to the 
enterprise abroad), the value added created in 
the individual stages of production (output 
minus intermediate goods) is allocated to the 
manufacturing sector of the respective country 
of the producing unit. In the case of trans-
actions within a multinational enterprise, the 
breakdown of value added at home and abroad 
is carried out on the basis of transfer pricing. 
Under these conditions, foreign trade transac -
tions are recorded in the same way in the na -
tional accounts and the foreign trade statistics.
It is also possible for the domestic enterprise to 
merely place a production order with the enter -
prise abroad. Economic ownership of the 
goods involved in the production process 
would thereby remain with the domestic enter -
prise. Under the ESA 2010, such manufacturing 
performed for a fee, but without a transfer of 
economic ownership, is referred to as contract 
manufacturing. This manufacturing is categor -Traditional

17 In the ESA 1995, firms’ own- account expenditure on 
research and development was still regarded as intermedi -
ate consumption. The change in accounting approach was 
explained by the similarity to other investment processes 
and the growing importance of intangible assets in the 
production process. For questions on reporting with regard 
to the recognition of intellectual property, see OECD, Fras -

ised as a service, even if the goods are pro -
cessed or manufactured by the non- resident 
company. In the balance of payments and the 
national accounts, such manufacturing is re -
corded as an import of services in the domestic 
country and should be recorded as an export of 
services in the foreign country. The share of the 
value added ascribed to the foreign country is 
derived from the fee agreed in exchange for 
the processing performed. The remainder of 
the value added is ascribed to the domestic 
contracting party and allocated to the manu -
facturing sector.20 However, the value of semi- 
finished or finished goods transferred across 
national borders in the course of contract 
manufacturing transactions is not recorded 
under trade in goods pursuant to the national 
accounts, as only transactions associated with 
a change of ownership are recorded there. 
Hence, the physical movement of goods di -
verges from the income streams recorded in 
the national accounts if the physical flow of 
goods does not match the path of ownership 
transfer. This is the case if a domestic enterprise 
purchases an intermediate good, which the 
non- resident manufacturer sends directly to the 
non- resident company in charge of production, 
or if the non- resident enterprise delivers the 
finished product directly to the non- resident 
customer. In both cases, payments flow across national borders from or to the resident enter -
prise.
In extreme cases, all production is outsourced, 
as opposed to just individual production stages. 
In such a case, the domestic enterprise would, 
for example, only be in charge of product de -
sign as well as specifying and monitoring the 
production stages. Such enterprises are known 
as factoryless goods producers. How this is re -
corded depends on the ownership of the input 
factors used in production and of the finished 
product. If a factoryless goods producer is also 
the economic owner of the intermediate input 
factors and thus also of the finished product, 
production is treated as contract manufactur -
ing in statistical terms. If this is not the case, 
the factoryless goods producer is deemed to be 
a trader in goods who purchases and sells on 
the finished product.21
Accounting based on the ownership principle 
also applies to what is known as merchanting 
trade.22 In the case of such transactions, resi -Factoryless

dent traders acquire goods from non- resident 
producers and sell them to non- resident cus -
tomers, without the goods ever physically 
entering or leaving domestic territory. The flow 
of these transactions via domestic territory thus 
relates to ownership and payments, not to the 
physical movement of the goods.23 Here, the 
national accounts show the acquisition of 
goods by the merchants as a negative export of 
goods and the sale of goods as a positive ex -
port of goods.24 The determining factor for re -
cording this as a trade of goods transaction is 
solely the transfer of economic ownership. The 
difference between the acquisition cost of the 
goods and the sales proceeds is recorded as 
domestic value added.25
If the rights to the results of firms’ own- account 
research and development, such as patents, 
trademarks and copyrights, are managed by in -
stitutional units resident in another country, the 
accrued value added is divided up between the 
parent enterprise’s country of residence and 
that of the subsidiary managing the rights. The 
share of value added pertaining to the entity 
abroad depends on the transfer prices for the 
use of intellectual property products. In the 
event that intellectual property rights are trans -
ferred across national borders along with the 
economic ownership, the corresponding value 
added is transferred as well.26 Much the same 
is true of a legal transfer of a corporation’s 
headquarters. The transactions linked to these 
headquarters, including income arising from in -
tellectual property rights, would then count to -
wards the target country’s value added.
The exact features of cross- border activity may 
vary substantially and encompass complex 
business structures. For example, a group may 
be headquartered in country A, where research 
and development are conducted. The intellec -
tual property rights are outsourced to a special 
purpose vehicle in country B. The actual phys -
ical production of the product is performed in 
country C, with input factors from yet other 
countries. There are units in other countries 
which also take charge of distribution in a number of neighbouring countries. How to re -
cord such complex cross- border business activ -
ities in the national accounts requires a rela -
tively detailed knowledge of the production 
process in place and the prevailing economic 
and legal ownership structure as well as a high 
level of coordination between the statistical of -
fices. Moreover, given that rules and recom -
mendations are not in place for all conceivable 
cases, it is likely that decisions on how to re -
cord highly complex transactions are made on 
a case- by- case basis.27
The informative value 
of domestic  product as 
a measure  of domestic 
production 
Despite a strict application of the ESA 2010 
principles, value added cannot always be clearly 
allocated to specific national units as the or -
ganisational structure of multinational enter -
prise groups is sometimes very complex. Prob -
lems arise, for instance, from the application of 
transfer prices for intermediate goods and for 
the use of intellectual property products. Pursu -
ant to the requirements of the ESA 2010, trans -
fer prices should be equivalent to market prices. 
However, many services are never or rarely 
traded on markets, which makes it difficult to 
determine the corresponding prices. It is likely 
that enterprises will often carry out their re -
porting based on intra-  group transfer prices – 
an area in which enterprises enjoy discretion. 
This discretionary scope may be used, for ex -Outsourcing

25 Such transactions can also occur at leasing enterprises, 
who may, for instance, lease capital goods which have 
never physically been in domestic territory, but were pro -
duced in one foreign country and are used in another for -
eign country. The owner is the domestic leasing enterprise.
26 A transfer of value added shares also occurs in the 
event of a cross- border sale of ownership rights.

ample, to report the smallest possible amount 
of income domestically and a correspondingly 
higher amount in a country that is more fa -
vourable in terms of tax. For this purpose, ex -
ports to such a country are undervalued, 
whereas imports are overvalued. The GDP re -
corded at home compared with estimated 
“real” market prices would then be too low 
and that recorded abroad would be too high.28 
Internationally coordinated regulatory and fis -
cal rules should, however, be able to limit en -
terprises’ room for manoeuvre in this regard 
(see the box on pp. 72 ff.).
A country’s domestic product can also reflect 
purely organisational decisions taken by multi -
national enterprise groups. In the case of out -
sourcing intellectual property rights or transfer -
ring an enterprise’s headquarters to which the 
intellectual property rights are linked, the pro -
ceeds assigned to intangible assets are trans -
ferred across national borders and subsequently 
treated as domestic output in the respective 
foreign country.29 Domestic product can there -
fore contain value added which is not gener -
ated through the joint deployment of domestic 
labour and installed capital, but is the result of 
income streams from ownership rights held by 
domestic subsidiaries which do not themselves 
carry out any manufacturing. The geographical 
separation of an enterprise’s headquarters, the 
production sites and the locations of its various 
subsidiaries is a key characteristic of globalised 
economic activity. The current accounting prac -
tice reflects the associated payment streams. 
However, this represents a break with the no -
tion that income is generated at the place of 
physical production through the joint deploy -
ment of labour and capital.30 As a result of 
globalisation, the national accounts series are 
departing from established concepts of macro -
economic analysis.
Outsourcing intellectual property rights to non- 
producing subsidiaries abroad also has implica -
tions for the sectoral composition of the do -
mestic product. For instance, both the country 
in which the parent enterprise is domiciled and that of the subsidiary owning the intellectual 
property products can record value added in 
the manufacturing sector without having to 
carry out the corresponding manufacturing or 
having the necessary production capacity in 
place for this. The functions performed by the 
parent enterprise itself may include services 
such as marketing and accounting. By contrast, 
in the country where the physical production 
takes place, the material transformation can be 
recorded as a service (contract manufacturing). 
The national accounts statistics measure the 
factor income generated in these sectors, in -
cluding the charges for the use of intangible 
assets.
The impact of accounting 
practices under ESA 2010 
on economic analysis
The accounting rules outlined here have poten -
tially far- reaching implications for the analysis 
of macroeconomic trends and relationships. 
This applies not only to the allocation of eco -
nomic output by region and sector or the re -
cording of aggregate output, but also to eco -
nomic growth, imports and exports, invest -
ment activity, productivity, and unit labour 
costs.Organisational

29 In principle, outsourcing physical capital has the same 
effect but is more costly than a shift of intellectual property 
rights and therefore less important.

Globalisation and offi   cial statistics – the way forward
In order to meet the statistical challenges 
arising from the cross- border economic ac-
tivities of multinational enterprise groups, 
offi   cial statistics producers need to make 
better contextualised use of the data from 
the various statistical fi  elds and step up 
their cross- border cooperation. This is the 
objective of a number of initiatives at the 
national, European and international levels.
The most important thing here is to stand-
ardise reports from enterprises and enter-
prise groups by way of common defi  nitions 
and standards and thus facilitate the ex-
change of information, both between the 
various statistical fi  elds and between data 
producers. With its Framework Regulation 
Integrating Business Statistics (FRIBS), the 
EU intends to consolidate all regulations for 
short- term business statistics and structural 
statistics in one legal basis.1 The corres-
ponding draft regulation has not yet been 
fi  nalised.2 This regulation is intended to 
consolidate and further harmonise the legal 
bases for the fi  eld of business statistics. It 
includes a number of provisions that will 
help improve the recording of multinational 
activities. The role of the national business 
registers will be strengthened and it will be-
come easier to exchange information be-
tween them. The single European statistical 
defi  nition of “enterprise”3 is to be imple-
mented in all areas, after previous attempts 
proved to be only partially successful. In fu-
ture, it will be possible to exchange infor-
mation on trade in goods in a largely stand-
ardised way, and sales and production data 
in the services sector will be reported on a 
monthly rather than quarterly basis, as is 
already  the case for manufacturing. Im-
provements are also to be made to the re-
cording of cross- border trade in services 
and cross- border supply chains.With the Data Gaps Initiative, the G20 
agreed on a number of steps to improve 
the data basis, while also aiming to capture 
multinational economic activity more pre-
cisely.4 The second phase of this initiative 
now also demands the removal of obstacles 
faced by statistical authorities with regard 
to a more extensive exchange of data and 
metadata, without this jeopardising statis-
tical confi  dentiality.5
Alongside the members of the OECD and 
G20, other developing countries and emer-
ging market economies also participate in

working group.
3 In European statistics, an enterprise is the smallest 
independent economic entity with a certain degree of 
autonomy in decision- making. If economically neces-
sary activities, such as accounting, are spun off in sep-
arate units, then the enterprise consists of multiple 
legal units in statistical terms. It is possible for such 
legal units of an enterprise group to be based in differ-
ent countries. A comprehensive and consistent imple-
mentation of this concept in the EU has yet to occur.

the Base Erosion and Profi  t Shifting Project, 
which aims to combat tax avoidance by 
multinational enterprise groups and curb 
tax competition between countries.6 Al-
though the initiative does not have a statis-
tical background, it could nevertheless be 
of considerable importance for the quality 
of the data bases. The project was com-
pleted in October 2015 with a series of rec-
ommendations. Since then, an automated 
exchange of information between tax au-
thorities has been introduced with the com-
mon reporting standard. The international 
guidelines on transfer pricing7 have been 
updated to restrict loopholes. For transac-
tions between affi   liated enterprises, the 
prices charged must generally be those that 
would have been charged in comparable 
transactions between independent third 
parties. Furthermore, for external reporting 
purposes, enterprises are obligated to break 
down most of their economic activities by 
country.8 This has already been transposed 
into German national law.9 These arrange-
ments are also likely to indirectly improve 
the international comparability and quality 
of statistical data.
As globalisation can entail rapid changes in 
the organisation of multinational enterprise 
groups, such changes need to be recorded 
as soon as possible after they occur. Fur-
thermore, the collection and processing of 
this information must be coordinated at the 
international level if asymmetries in the 
statistical data from different countries are 
to be avoided. This requires improvements 
to the statistical infrastructure and the 
exchange  of information.10 To this end, 
changes are being made to business regis-
ters. At the EU level, the EuroGroups Regis-
ter has been in operation for some years. It 
provides reference data for all enterprise 
groups that are active in more than one EU 
country to ensure that consistent statistical 
treatment is possible in the participating countries. Data on ownership structures, 
particularly on intra- group relationships, are 
also provided. In parallel, the Eurosystem is 
setting up a business register for the euro 
area with its Register of Institutions and Af-
fi  liates Data (deepened and broadened by 
AnaCredit, the ESCB credit data statistics).
For the production of internationally coord-
inated statistics, it is essential that the rele-
vant domestic and foreign producers of 
statistics are able to use the national and 
supranational registers. It would be helpful 
to put in place the necessary legal arrange-
ments for an exchange of data between the 
national business registers and the Eurosys-
tem business register. This could improve 
the statistical database and thus the coher-
ence of fi  nancial and non- fi  nancial statis-
tics.11

erence data.12 While it is, in principle, vol-
untary for enterprises to apply for such an 
identifi  er, the European Markets in Financial 
Instruments Regulation and other regula-
tions already require such an identifi  er to be 
quoted when submitting certain reports.
In 2017, a European early warning system13 
to identify signifi  cant restructurings of 
multinational enterprise groups was also set 
up. It aims to ensure a coordinated ap-
proach between the relevant authorities 
and central banks through the exchange of 
information at the earliest possible stage. In 
some statistical offi   ces in the EU, such as in 
Ireland and the Netherlands, “large cases 
units” have already been set up. These are 
intended to ensure complete and consistent 
recording of the activities of large multi-
national enterprise groups that are active in 
their respective countries.
In order to improve the recording of gross 
national income (GNI), the European Statis-
tical System has set up a pilot project to 
examine the way in which the activities of a 
select number of very large multinational 
enterprise groups are captured in the na-
tional accounts of the Member States. The 
assessments of groups based in Germany 
are being coordinated by the Federal Statis-
tical Offi   ce. It is envisaged that data on 
these groups will be exchanged in a non- 
anonymised form between the relevant 
Member States and Eurostat, in compliance 
with the legal provisions.14 The focus of this 
examination is on whether the value added 
of enterprises and their legal entities is 
being booked in full and in the correct 
EU Member States. In addition, a review is also taking place as to whether transactions 
involving intellectual property products are 
being adequately captured, particularly 
with regard to research and development.
The EuroGroups Register, the early warning 
system and the GNI pilot project are import-
ant approaches at the European level for a 
granular information exchange between 
producers of offi   cial statistics in Europe. 
Thus far, however, this exchange is limited 
to a few narrowly defi  ned fi  elds. For a rad-
ical improvement in the information base, it 
would be necessary for the exchange of 
data within the statistical systems to be sim-
plifi  ed overall without compromising confi  -
dentiality, as proposed in recommendation 
20 of the second phase of the G20 Data 
Gaps Initiative.

Jumps in time series following 
relocation of intellectual 
property  rights
If intellectual property rights are relocated 
across borders, if intellectual property usage 
fees change, or if an enterprise’s headquarters 
are relocated, then the corresponding value 
added is also transferred to another country. 
For that transfer, the change in economic own -
ership is crucial. It need not necessarily entail 
changes in the production process itself or in 
the utilisation of labour or physically installed 
capital. Depending on the size of the affected 
country and of the transaction, this can have a 
considerable impact on GDP and its compon -
ents. For instance, in the summer of 2016, Irish 
GDP from the first quarter of 2015 onwards 
was retroactively revised upwards by almost a 
quarter due to the restructuring operations of 
multinational enterprise groups at the time.31 
The underlying transactions were not disclosed 
for confidentiality reasons. However, communi -
cation from the Irish Central Statistics Office 
and Eurostat revealed that intellectual property 
rights worth €300 billion (150% of Ireland’s 
GDP in 2014) were transferred to legally associ -
ated entities that were already operating in Ire -
land.32 According to the assessment of the Irish 
Central Statistics Office, the units in Ireland are 
now the economic owners of these intellectual 
property products.33 The licensing income from 
these intellectual property products is conse -
quently factored into Irish exports of services. 
In addition, the Irish entities are classified as 
factoryless goods producers that are the eco -
nomic owners of the input materials and of the 
final output.34 As a result, the processing car -
ried out abroad is recorded as contract manu -
facturing services and the income from the 
sales of the final products is allocated to Irish 
exports of goods in the national accounts. In -
tellectual property products newly created by 
the business entities in Ireland are registered as 
Irish gross fixed capital formation.
The unusually large GDP rise in 2015 was there -
fore largely due to the income from licensing (services exports) newly ascribed to Ireland as 
well as the sales of the final products (goods 
exports). According to the definition in the na -
tional accounts, total exports including services 
correspondingly rose by nearly one- third. Con -
versely, the increased reliance on foreign manu -
facturing services led to services imports rising 
by one- fifth.
Estimated investment in intellectual property 
products grew by 170% in 2015. However, un -
like in the case of value added, this did not 
amount to a long-  term level shift. Admittedly, 
investment expenditure for intellectual prop -
erty products again saw very strong growth in 
2016. In 2017, however, it fell by almost a third 
compared with the previous year. Besides these 
examples, there were subsequent further con -
spicuous movements in the time series of the 
Irish national accounts. Without additional in -
formation, these time series are no longer us -
able for economic and growth analyses.35
Level shifts and jumps in macroeconomic time 
series due to relocation of intellectual property 
rights are likely to affect small economies in 
particular. Difficulties in conducting economic 
analyses can also arise for larger economic re -
gions, however. Without adequate communi -

ucts could potentially be falsely attributed to 
cyclical movements. Especially in the cases of 
major countries, there is a danger of these 
jumps and level shifts not being properly recog -
nised as such due to their smaller relative mag -
nitudes. For example, after the level of Irish 
GDP was shifted by one- quarter, euro area GDP 
was revised upwards by ½%. Without the Irish 
one- off effect, the annual GDP growth rate in 
the euro area would have been 1.5% in 2015, 
representing only a gradual increase over the 
1.4% GDP growth rate of the previous year. By 
contrast, due to the Irish one- off effect, the of -
ficial time series depicts significant strengthen -
ing to 1.9%. The growth rate would have sub -
sequently remained static in 2016. Excluding 
Ireland, however, the data indicate a cyclical 
upturn, which would have better reflected the 
underlying economic trends.36 Furthermore, in -
vestment in intellectual property products in 
Ireland in 2016 was so significant that even of -
ficial figures on investment activity in the euro 
area have recently been skewed. Official euro 
area figures indicate that investment activity 
decelerated in 2017. If the Irish contribution to 
the euro area is ignored, however, it becomes 
clearly apparent that the upswing in invest -
ment activity continued last year.37 For this rea -
son, alongside the official national accounts 
figures, the Bundesbank also uses its own time 
series excluding Ireland for its euro area eco -
nomic analysis.Selected economic data for Ireland

36 Similar irregularities can also be found in Irish primary 
statistics such as industrial production.
37 In line with the Dutch figures published in summer 2018 
as part of a major revision, there were also significant 
changes here in gross fixed capital formation. According to 
the revised data, real investment expenditure rose by sea -
sonally adjusted 160% on the quarter in the second quar -
ter of 2015. The reason for this was unusually high invest -
ment in intellectual property products. The investment was 
sourced from imports of services. In the third quarter, price- 
adjusted gross fixed capital formation then fell by just 
under half. These changes are also reflected in the euro 
area aggregates. They also explain the year- on- year decline 
in investment in the second quarter of 2016 with this base 
effect. By contrast, real gross fixed capital formation in the 
euro area rose fairly steadily during the second quarter of 
2016. See Statistics Netherlands (2018), National accounts

Distortion of derived indicators
The jumps in GDP also make it more difficult to 
interpret key derived macroeconomic indica -
tors. Against a backdrop of relatively steady 
growth in employment, average labour prod -
uctivity in Ireland rose by just over one- fifth in 
2015 according to official figures. However, this 
is just the product of a particular statistical 
approach . The actual productivity of the Irish 
labour force is likely to have risen to a much 
more limited extent. Accordingly, the average 
compensation of employees also only increased 
by just under 3%. As a consequence, unit la -
bour costs appear to have fallen by no less 
than 15%. This would represent a distinct im -
provement in the competitiveness of the Irish 
economy. In actual fact, however, the competi -
tiveness of Irish companies is likely to have im -
proved to a far lesser degree. Similar problems 
regarding the usefulness of indicators affect 
other key macroeconomic indicators such as 
the aggregate output gap, labour income 
share, current account balance as well as 
budget balance and government debt in rela -
tion to GDP . All of this also has consequences 
for model- based empirical economic research.
Differences between goods 
trade data in national accounts 
and foreign trade statistics
While goods trade transactions in the national 
accounts are defined based on the ownership 
principle pursuant to the European System of 
Accounts (ESA 2010) and the Balance of Pay -
ments and International Investment Position 
Manual (BPM6), foreign trade statistics continue 
to revolve around goods physically crossing bor -
ders.38 Discrepancies in these statistics occur in 
particular where there is a high proportion of 
contract manufacturing and as a result of mer -
chanting transactions. These discrepancies con -
cern the absolute values of imports and exports, 
their rates of change, as well as the balance of 
trade. In Germany, for example, export earnings 
in 2017 amounted to €1,279 billion in the for -eign trade statistics (special trade) and €1,270 
billion in the national accounts.39 Expenditure Greater

38 Another difference resulting from this definition is that 
the value of the goods in the foreign trade statistics is 
evaluated at the reporting country’s border (imports includ -
ing transport and insurance costs, exports excluding trans -
port and insurance costs), while goods in the balance of 
payments (goods trade) are evaluated at the border of the 
exporting country (i.e. always excluding transport and in -
surance costs). Taken in isolation, imports in goods trade 
(national accounts) are thus lower than imports in foreign 
trade. Accordingly, the goods trade balance is likely to be 
higher than the foreign trade balance.
39 The goods exports in the national accounts are derived 
from general trade in goods (which comprises special trade 
and supplementary trade items) as well as net goods ex -
ports in merchanting trade and exports of non- monetary 
gold. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Statistical Supplement, 
Balance of payments statistics, table I.3.a.Deutsche Bundesbank

on imports also came out higher in the foreign 
trade statistics than in the national accounts. 
By contrast, the trade balance was higher when 
calculated using the national accounts ap -
proach (€265 billion or 8.1% of GDP compared 
with €244 billion or 7.5% of GDP). There were 
considerably larger discrepancies for Ireland. 
According to the national accounts, goods ex -
ports totalled €193 billion or 65% of GDP in 
2017. In the foreign trade statistics, this figure 
was €122 billion or 42% of GDP . In the case of 
imports, this gap was significantly narrower. 
This reflected the fact that multinational enter -
prise groups domiciled in Ireland outsource 
considerable volumes of production abroad via 
contract manufacturing. In the national ac -
counts, this is recorded as imports of services. 
Conversely, the income from the sales of the 
goods produced is recorded as Irish exports of 
goods. Accordingly, the surplus in goods trade 
comes out considerably higher using the na -
tional accounts method (€104 billion) than in 
the trade statistics (€44 billion).40 Once again, 
this shows just how far removed cross- border 
income streams linked to goods trade can be -
come from traditional trade flows due to the 
impact of globalisation.
Outlook and initiatives
The problems in capturing and classifying the 
economic activity of multinational enterprise 
groups and their implications for economic an -
alysis have been thoroughly investigated in re -
cent years. In 2016, a working group was set 
up in Ireland to shed light on the GDP level 
shift and to devise supplementary indicators for 
measuring domestic economic output.41 Since 
last year, the Irish Central Statistics Office has published figures for gross national income ad -
justed for certain activities of multinational en -
terprises. Furthermore, the figures for the value 
added of multinational enterprise groups are 
presented separately.42 In this respect, the Irish 
Central Statistics Office has taken on a pioneer -
ing role.
There are also a number of international initia -
tives to address the challenges posed by glob -
alisation with regard to official statistics. In par -
ticular, the aim is to process larger volumes of 
data at the international level and to increase 
harmonisation between national statistics and 
individual statistical fields (see the box on 
p. 72 ff.). However, it would also be important 
to develop standards for communicating level 
shifts in macroeconomic indicators due to spe -
cific activities of multinational enterprises. In 
terms of economic analysis, it is essential to be 
able to differentiate between transfers of cap -
ital stock and material macroeconomic devel -
opments. For this reason, the impact of multi -
national enterprise groups’ cross- border activ -
ities on the presentation of macroeconomic 
data should – with due regard to the relevant 
data protection provisions – be made more ap -
parent.43

The growing importance of exchange- 
traded funds in the financial markets
Exchange- traded funds (ETFs) are vehicles in the form of investment funds that usually replicate a 
benchmark index and whose shares are traded on stock exchanges. As such, ETFs differ from 
traditional open- end investment funds, which are characterised by the fact that fund shares are 
traded directly with the fund provider. The ETF segment has grown enormously in recent years, 
making it an increasingly important fixture of the financial markets.
A major driving force behind ETF growth is that investors are given the opportunity to cost-  
efficiently invest in a diversified portfolio, which also underpins the trend towards passive invest -
ment strategies to accumulate assets.
The possible risks involved in making an ETF investment are chiefly the market and credit risk asso -
ciated with ETFs’ underlying assets. In view of their complex structure, however, ETFs can also 
have specific effects on market liquidity in the financial system. This issue has become the subject 
of mounting debate between market participants, academics and supervisors, which is why it is 
one of the focal points of this article.
There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that ETFs enhance liquidity conditions in compara -
tively illiquid asset classes during quiet market phases. What has not been tested up to now, 
however, is the extent to which this improvement in liquidity generated by ETFs also holds during 
a protracted period of market stress. It is crucial in this connection that parties known as author -
ised participants, which play a key role in primary and secondary market ETF trading, function 
properly. In addition, an analysis of several flash crashes indicates that the way to alleviate 
possible  market disruption depends on how specific market structures are designed.Deutsche Bundesbank

The evolution of the ETF 
sector  in recent years
The importance of ETFs as an investment 
vehicle  in the international financial system has 
grown in recent years. The value of the assets 
managed worldwide by all types of investment 
funds stood at US$37.1 trillion at the end of the 
first half of 2018, of which ETFs accounted for 
US$5.1 trillion (13.7%) (see the upper panel of 
the chart below).1 The biggest of all the invest -
ment fund categories remains the traditional 
open- end investment funds,2 which hold assets 
worth US$29.3 trillion. This makes it clear that 
the ETF sector is still of comparatively negligible 
significance. However, its growth momentum 
has been particularly pronounced in recent 
years. For instance, ETFs accounted for a mere 
US$0.7 trillion (5.4%) of the assets managed by 
all types of investment funds back in early 
2009. Since then, its share of all fund products 
has increased significantly, which is attributable 
to considerably higher growth rates for ETFs compared to those for open- end investment 
funds (and other investment funds) over the 
past few years (see the lower panel of the chart 
on this page). While, for example, the ETF sec -
tor expanded by 18.9% in 2017, open- end in -
vestment funds and other funds recorded like -
wise positive but significantly lower growth 
rates of 5.1% and 3.8% respectively.3 Despite 
the high growth rates enjoyed by ETFs, the in -
crease in assets managed by open- end invest -
ment funds remains the largest in absolute 
terms. At US$5.4 trillion in 2017, growth in this 
segment far surpassed that in the ETF segment, 
which amounted to US$1.3 trillion in the same 
period.
Valued at US$3,868 billion, stock ETFs domin -
ated the global ETF sector at the end of the first 
half of 2018 (see the chart on p. 81). However, 
bond ETFs have grown in prominence in recent 
years – holding US$814 billion in assets in the 
same period, they take second place. With a 
value of US$129 billion, commodity ETFs make 
up the third most important segment. All other 
categories are of secondary importance, each 
being worth less than US$100 billion.
By far the largest target region for investing via 
ETFs is North America, which, with 933 ETFs, 
makes up 57% of ETF assets worldwide (see 
the lower chart on p. 81). ETFs holding secur -
ities that are domiciled in Asia account for 19% 
of ETF assets worldwide (1,131 ETFs). ETFs with Growing import -

1 The figures presented here are based on data supplied by 
the data provider Morningstar and are available from the 
start of 2009. This means that it is possible to track growth 
in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the associated 
rise in the importance of ETFs. Data on ETFs can also be 
found in the Bundesbank’s capital market statistics. These 
cover ETFs established under German law; given the inten -
tion to provide a global perspective in this article, these will 
not be discussed in detail. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Stat -
istical Supplement 2 – Capital market statistics, pp. 73 f.
2 Various definitions can be found in databases and the 
literature. Strictly speaking, ETFs are also open- end invest -
ment funds. However, they are treated here as a sector in 
their own right – a sector that differs from the “traditional 
open- end investment fund” sector (hereinafter referred to 
simply as “open- end investment funds”).
3 These developments are not solely attributable to inflows 
of investor capital. The fund segments’ growth dynamics 
are also affected by price increases. However, the ETF sec -
tor’s higher growth in relative terms is unlikely to have 
been chiefly driven by these.Deutsche Bundesbank

global and European portfolios make up 14% 
and 9% respectively of ETF assets worldwide 
(1,414 and 1,181 ETFs).
ETFs: how they work and 
how they are structured
ETFs are investment vehicles that usually track 
the performance of an index – a stock price 
index, for example. Unlike open- end invest -
ment funds, which are priced and traded only 
once a day, ETFs can be traded throughout the 
day on secondary markets (mostly stock ex -
changes), making them comparable to stocks 
in this regard. In order to facilitate this intraday 
trading, ETFs require a structure different to 
that of open- end investment funds. The latter 
are designed such that investors trade fund 
shares directly with the investment company. In 
line with inflows or outflows, the fund man -
ager then purchases or sells assets (e.g. listed 
securities) on the stock exchange or in OTC 
markets. The net asset value (NAV) is the value 
of all assets in the fund portfolio less its liabil -
ities. The NAV is determined at the end of the 
trading day and serves as the basis for selling or 
purchasing fund shares.4 In the case of both 
ETFs and open- end investment funds, the se -
curities held in the portfolio constitute a special 
fund that is protected against direct access by 
the investment company (or its creditors) in the 
event of insolvency.
Creation of ETF shares on the 
primary market
ETFs differ from open- end investment funds in 
that no direct trading takes place between the 
fund provider and investors. On the primary 
market, agents known as authorised partici -
pants (APs) –  typically large financial institu -
tions or specialised market makers – serve as 
the link between the ETF primary market and 
the ETF secondary market. In a first step, trad -
ing takes place on the primary market, where 
APs provide a basket of securities5 (or, in rarer Intraday ETF

4 Some open- end investment funds can also be exchange- 
traded (on an intraday basis). However, it is difficult to de -
termine a fair price here given that there is no comparison 
with a benchmark index as there is for ETFs.
5 ETF providers can also hold assets that are not securities. 
This applies to real estate ETFs, for instance. However, the 
term “securities” is used consistently throughout this article 
due to the fact that ETF providers hold securities in their 
ETF portfolios in the vast majority of cases.Deutsche Bundesbank

cases, cash) in exchange for ETF shares from 
ETF providers. These bundles of newly created 
ETF shares are referred to as creation units and 
are normally issued in large blocks of 50,000 
or, in some instances, multiples thereof. Just as 
APs can create ETF shares, they can also re -
deem them by returning creation units to the 
ETF provider in exchange for securities. This 
process is often referred to as the creation/ re-
demption mechanism (see the right- hand panel 
of the chart on p. 83). It should be noted here 
that APs have no legal obligation to either cre -
ate or redeem ETF shares. The (trading) costs 
incurred during this process are usually borne 
by the AP . The charges incurred for investors 
amount to less than 1 basis point (0.01%) for 
most ETFs.6
Trading ETF shares on the 
secondary  market
In a second step, investors trade the created 
ETF shares on the secondary market (see the 
left- hand panel of the chart on p. 83). Trading 
typically takes place either on the stock ex -
change or directly with market makers.7 In this 
context, APs may assume a dual role, as they 
often also operate as market makers on the ETF 
secondary market. In this way, investors are 
able to trade individual ETF shares without new 
ETF shares having to be created or redeemed 
for such transactions. This makes intraday trad -
ing on the secondary market possible. New ETF 
shares are only created, then, if these are pur -
chased by the investor via an AP , but the AP 
itself no longer has sufficient holdings of ETF 
shares and cannot procure them via the 
stock exchange. High demand for ETF shares 
amongst investors thus tends to result in the 
creation of new ETF shares on the primary mar -
ket. If demand for a certain ETF decreases 
amongst investors, the AP will ultimately take 
the ETF shares that it has accumulated, and 
which are no longer needed, and deliver them 
to the ETF provider in exchange for securities. 
The process described here basically boils down 
to changing the form in which securities are held. Either the ETF shares or the underlying se -
curities are traded on the market. From a 
macroprudential perspective, however, this can 
also be accompanied by a change in liquidity 
risk.8
ETFs’ net asset value and secondary 
market price
As is the case for open- end investment funds, 
ETFs generally publish their NAV daily. For ETFs, 
this is based on an overview of the portfolio of 
securities held by the ETF provider. It is always 
generated at the end of the trading day. The 
daily NAV serves as an important metric for 
transparent pricing on the stock exchange and 
facilitates the arbitrage mechanism that under -
lies the creation/ redemption mechanism. The 
NAV and the price of ETF shares traded on the 
secondary market may differ from one another 
over the course of the trading day. As a general 
rule, the price of ETF shares is derived from the 
relationship between ETF supply and demand 
on the stock exchange.
Intraday differences between the prices of se -
curities and ETF shares should tend to be elim -
inated by APs’ arbitrage mechanisms when the 
NAV is recalculated at the end of the trading 
day. If, for example, the price of a certain ETF 
share is below the fair value assumed by the 
AP , the AP has an incentive to purchase these 
ETF shares. The AP can hold on to the ETF 
shares it has purchased until such time as a fa -
vourable price emerges at which it can either 
sell them directly or deliver them to the ETF 
provider in exchange for securities. However, it 
is also possible for the NAV and the price of ETF Secondary

sawi (2017), Exchange-  Traded Funds, Annual Review of 
Finan cial Economics, Vol. 9, pp. 169-189, the average fee 
per creation unit created on the primary market is 
US$1,047, while the median is US$500.
7 The bid and ask prices determined in this connection are 
risk prices that are executed by the AP immediately without 
any delay. The market risk assumed by the AP , which is de -
termined by factors such as the liquidity of the underlying 
securities, is reflected together with additional implicit 
costs in the bid- ask spreads.

shares to diverge to a greater extent over the 
course of several days. This is especially the 
case for ETFs in less liquid markets, as low li -
quidity can result in delays in the adjustment of 
prices of individual securities in the basket of 
assets and, therefore, of the NAV.9
The primary/ secondary market mechanism pre -
sented here is a characteristic that is unique to 
ETFs. In view of their role as a link between the 
primary and secondary markets, APs are funda -
mentally important, with the result that par -
ticular attention should be paid to ensuring 
that they function properly.
Physical versus synthetic ETFs
ETFs can take two different forms – they can 
replicate a benchmark index physically or syn -
thetically. In the case of physical replication, a 
distinction is made between full replication and 
what is known as sampling. Full replication in -
volves the ETF tracking the benchmark index by 
holding the exact same underlying securities in 
the ETF provider’s basket of assets. This method 
is suited for stock and bond ETFs that comprise 
a low number of liquid securities, such as the 
DAX 30. Using the sampling method, only a se -
lection (or sample) of the securities in the 
benchmark index are held in the ETF provider’s portfolio. This method is an appropriate choice 
when securities are relatively illiquid and, in 
particular, the number of securities in the 
benchmark index is high. In addition to the 
issue of liquidity – more liquid securities tend to 
be preferred  – the representativeness of the 
index is also important when making the selec -
tion. For example, a US corporate bond ETF 
would be a good candidate for the sampling 
method, as this market comprises a total of 
more than 5,000 different bonds, a vast num -
ber of which are relatively illiquid.
In the case of synthetic ETFs, the index con -
cerned is replicated via derivatives. The ETF pro -
vider does not physically hold the basket of se -
curities in this set- up. Instead, the AP receives 
creation units in exchange for cash. This cash is 
then exchanged for a basket of securities that 
does not need to be linked to the index in 
question. The performance of this basket of se -
curities is then exchanged for the return on the 
benchmark index by means of a swap contract. 
This method is chosen if, inter alia, investment 
restrictions such as trading restrictions or tax -
ation make market access more difficult. How -
ever, it is also used for relatively liquid indices … which serve 
as key link 
between 
primary  and

such as the DAX 30 and EURO STOXX 50 on 
cost grounds.
Physical replication is the most common replica -
tion method for ETFs in both Europe and the 
United States. However, while sampling is 
clearly the replication method of choice for all 
ETFs currently available in the United States, the 
picture in Europe is more mixed (see the chart 
above). While full physical replication and sam -
pling together remain the most common repli -
cation method for ETFs here, analysing the 
three replication forms individually shows that 
synthetic replication is (still) the most widely 
adopted method in Europe at this time. The de -
cline in the number of synthetic ETFs in Europe 
since 2016 appears to be driven by the demand 
side. Going by market participants’ perceptions, 
the higher degree of complexity, the risks asso -
ciated with swap transactions and the lack of 
transparency relating to the securities held in 
portfolios clearly play an important role.Available range of investments
ETFs typically aim to track the performance of a 
particular index (passive ETFs). While the first 
ETFs merely tracked the performance of stock 
market indices,10 they are now available for a 
very wide variety of indices and encompass, 
inter alia, bond indices, sector indices such as 
sustainability or electric mobility, and volatility 
measures such as the VIX.
Smart beta ETFs and active ETFs represent a 
more recent development and are based on se -
lecting and/  or weighting individual securities 
(following a specific strategy).11 Their objective 
is to outperform a benchmark index. Examples 
of this are pursuing either a value-  oriented Wide range

10 The first ETF, named SPDR, was set up by State Street in 
1993. It tracks the performance of the US stock market 
index S&P 500 and is now the largest ETF in the world, with 
market capitalisation of US$289 billion as at September 
2018.

as passive investment strategies.Deutsche Bundesbank

strategy based on certain metrics such as the 
price- to- book ratio or following a growth-  
oriented strategy. Some smart beta ETFs also 
focus on selecting high- dividend stocks. Add -
itionally, smart beta ETFs can combine various 
factors. The idea behind this is to leverage di -
versification and correlation effects.
In addition to ETFs, there are also exchange-  
traded products (ETPs). ETPs are debt securities 
that can be further broken down into exchange- 
traded commodities (ETCs) and exchange-  
traded notes (ETNs).12 While ETCs focus exclu -
sively on tracking the performance of com -
modities, or on tracking commodities futures 
or commodities indices, ETNs are debt secur -
ities that track the performance of an under -
lying benchmark index outside the commod -
ities sector. As ETPs are (secured but also often 
unsecured) debt securities and do not have 
special fund status, the investor is exposed to 
the issuer’s credit risk when trading in these 
products. This gives rise to particular risks for 
the investor that are not comparable to those 
associated with ETFs.13
Also available are ETFs and ETPs that either pro -
vide leveraged exposure to the underlying 
benchmark indices (i.e. they amplify their re -
turns) or track declines in the value of the 
benchmark indices. These leveraged and/ or in-
verse ETFs and ETPs have a higher value at risk 
with respect to index performance (for more 
information, see the box on pp. 86 f.).
Driving forces behind 
exchange- traded fund 
growth
The strong growth observed in the ETF sector 
in recent years reflects its great popularity 
amongst investors and is attributable to various 
factors. In terms of growth drivers, it is possible 
to distinguish between product features, type 
of usage and structural trends (see the adjacent 
table), which are detailed below.Product features
One major product feature of ETFs is that they 
combine the advantages of open-  end invest -
ment funds and stocks. ETFs facilitate invest -
ment in diversified portfolios (as for open- end 
investment funds) and intraday trading on 
stock exchanges (as for stocks). In addition to 
greater flexibility with respect to buying and 
selling, this also enables transparent pricing on 
account of comparability with the benchmark 
index in the case of passive ETFs.
Secondary market trading of ETFs and 
additional  liquidity
Additional liquidity generated through second -
ary market trading is frequently attributed to 
ETFs. Investors can trade ETF shares without af -
fecting the benchmark index’s underlying indi -
vidual securities. In fact, ETFs are often more 
liquid than the average of their underlying indi -ETPs are debt

12 There is a lack of clarity in the literature with respect to 
how ETPs are defined. Some of the literature uses the def -
inition outlined here and defines ETPs as a separate invest -
ment vehicle that exists alongside ETFs. Other literature 
describes ETPs as an umbrella term that includes ETFs as 
one of various subcategories.

Exchange- traded funds for inverse volatility during the 
fl  ash crash1 of 5 February 2018
Through ETFs, investors can participate in 
the movements of certain volatility meas-
ures. There are also products available that 
are designed to track the inverse perform-
ance of a particular volatility index. Owing 
to the historically low (implied) volatility on 
the fi  nancial markets and the associated 
positive stock price movements, these prod-
ucts were enjoying growing popularity 
amongst investors in the lead- up to the 
fl  ash crash of 5  February 2018. This box 
looks at a specifi  c ETF offering inverse per-
formance to the VIX volatility index. The 
commentary is therefore of an illustrative 
nature and is intended to provide an insight 
into the highly diverse risks associated with 
ETFs with respect to price movements.
On Monday, 5 February 2018, the US fi  nan-
cial markets were rocked by heavy turbu-lence late in the trading day. The S&P 500 
stock market index closed having fallen 
around 4% that day. Against the backdrop 
of this market development, there was a 
marked rise in implied volatility. Implied 
volatility refl  ects current expectations re-
garding the price swings for a given under-
lying instrument, so when implied volatility 
is on a strong upward trajectory, this is 
often interpreted by market participants as 
a rise in the “fear barometer”. The VIX, 
which is a measure of implied volatility for 
the US stock market index S&P 500, rose 
temporarily over the course of 5 February 
1 A fl  ash crash is a rapid, deep and volatile decline in 
security prices. Automated trading algorithms and 
high- frequency trading generally play a part in such 
events, which are also characterised by swift price 
recovery . See D. Bozdog (2011), Rare Events Analysis 
of  High- Frequency Equity Data, Wilmott Journal, 
pp. 74-81.

2018 from 17.31 points to 37.32 points – a 
116% increase (see the chart on p. 86).
As implied volatility climbed from 5 Febru-
ary 2018, ETFs designed to track the inverse 
performance of the VIX saw prices tumble. 
The ProShares Short VIX Short- Term Futures 
ETF (SVXY) serves here as an example. At 
the time of the fl  ash crash, it was tracking 
the daily percentage changes of a synthetic 
30- day VIX future,2 the performance of 
which is closely linked to the VIX, with a 
leverage factor of -1.0. In other words, if 
the 30- day VIX future index rose by 5% on 
a single trading day, the SVXY would have 
fallen by 5%. The sharp VIX increase from 
5  February 2018 (and the associated up-
ward movement of the synthetic 30- day 
VIX future) led the SVXY to fall by 91% in 
the space of four days (see the chart 
above).3 It is important to point out here 
that the ETF provider made explicit refer-
ence to this risk in its prospectus and the 
ETF functioned exactly as described.
The example of the SVXY shows that some 
ETFs carry a very high profi  t and loss poten-
tial. Whilst an investment in the S&P 500 via 
an ETF would have resulted in only tempor-
ary, manageable losses,4 investors in the in-
verse VIX ETF had heavy losses to bear. The 
case examined here makes plain that the 
various types of products that exist in the 
ETF/ ETP universe can vary hugely in terms of 
the level of risk entailed. Furthermore, in 
periods of stress, these kinds of products 
may have an impact on the underlying se-
curities or derivatives markets.52 The synthetic 30- day VIX future is a weighted basket 
of VIX futures with 20 and 50- day maturities.
3 A new factor of -0.5 was introduced on 28 February 
2018, and this has contributed to the SVXY’s smaller 
percentage price swings since then. In addition, fol-
lowing the signifi  cant price declines in February 2018 
and owing to the lower basis, the percentage changes 
are leading to less pronounced fl  uctuations in absolute 
terms.
4 ETFs tracking the development of the S&P 500 (such 
as the SPDR) only fell by around 6.5% between 5 and 
8 February 2018, and on 26 February 2018 had already 
surpassed 2 February 2018 levels again.

ket stress, see the box on pp. 97 ff.VIX and inverse VIX ETF

vidual securities (see the box on pp.  89 ff.). 
However, this liquidity advantage is probably 
largely at play during periods of low volatility 
on the financial markets. By contrast, the sec -
ondary market liquidity generated by ETFs can 
potentially dry up quickly, particularly during 
periods of pronounced market stress.14
Cost efficiency
Another product feature of ETFs is their high 
cost efficiency, especially in comparison with 
traditional investment funds, some of which 
currently charge considerable fees for active 
management. On the one hand, actively man -
aged open- end investment funds sometimes 
incur higher charges which do not apply to 
ETFs (such as transfer agent fees). As ETF trades 
on the secondary market are not performed 
with the fund provider directly, front- end loads 
are either lower or non- existent. On the other 
hand, awareness of price competition and cost 
sensitivity in relation to open- end investment funds do not appear to have been particularly 
pronounced amongst investors in the past.15 
However, the differences in cost between vari -
ous investment vehicles are likely to have be -
come more important to many investors re -
cently, as the percentage of the expected total 
return accounted for by costs is higher in many 
asset classes in the low interest rate environ -
ment. A further reason behind the higher cost 
efficiency of ETFs lies in their structure. For ex -
ample, the costs arising during the creation 
process on the ETF primary market, such as the 
bid- ask spread of the underlying securities, 
broker fees, taxes, exchange charges and AP 
fees (see the adjacent chart) are only incurred 
once and, over time, are spread across the dif -
ferent investors who trade in ETF shares on the 
ETF secondary market.
If active fund managers are not able to outper -
form the market as a whole (benchmark index), 
investors would not be compensated for the 
higher costs of actively managed funds by ex -
cess returns. Based on the assumption that the 
asset markets are informationally efficient and 
no costs are incurred when procuring and pro -
cessing information, securities reflect all the in -
formation available at any given time, meaning 
that excess future returns cannot be pre -
dicted.16 Actively managed funds would be 
crowded out of the market under such condi -
tions.

cost advantages

Liquidity analysis of exchange- traded funds
The bid- ask spread can be used as a simple 
measure of market liquidity. This metric is 
used here to gauge whether ETFs are more 
liquid than their underlying basket of secur-
ities or the relevant benchmark index. Vari-
ous trading venues (Germany: Frankfurt, 
Xetra; United States: New York, NYSE; Eur-
ope: respective national trading venues) 
and asset classes (stocks and bonds) are 
considered.
To analyse stock index ETFs, the normalised 
bid- ask spreads –  defi  ned as the bid- ask 
spread as a percentage of the closing 
price – are compared, on a weekly basis, 
with the weighted average bid- ask spreads 
of the stocks included in the relevant bench-
mark index for the period from January 
2013 to December 2017. The three ETFs 
analysed here consistently have a lower 
normalised bid- ask spread than their under-
lying benchmark indices. In the period 
under review, the iShares Core DAX UCITS 
ETF (DE) (DAXEX) has a bid- ask spread of 
3.9 basis points. The volume- weighted 
average of the individual securities in the 
benchmark index (DAX 30) comes to 4.5 
basis points, which is 0.6 basis point higher 
than the ETF (see the adjacent chart).
Similar results can be seen for the S&P 500 
index and FTSE Europe. In both cases, the 
bid- ask spreads of the ETFs are again lower 
than the average of the volume- weighted 
individual securities (see the table on p. 90). 
However, it should be noted that, for each 
of the three regions and benchmark indices, 
the ETF with the highest total net assets 
was chosen. This is likely to result in higher 
than average “liquidity advantages” com-
pared with other ETFs for the same bench-
mark indices.There are discernible differences not just 
between ETFs and benchmark indices, but 
also between the various trading venues. In 
the United States, both the ETF and the 
benchmark index tend to have lower bid- 
ask spreads than the corresponding metrics 
in Europe and Germany, though the spreads 
for the FTSE  Europe ETF are lower than 
those for the DAX 30 ETF. This refl  ects the 
higher average trading volume of the 
S&P 500 and an overall higher level of net 
assets in the US market compared with 
Europe  and Germany.
The situation is similar in the bond segment. 
Owing to the large number of assets in the 
underlying benchmark indices, a different 
method is used to analyse bond ETFs. The 
bid- ask spread is measured as at a specifi  c 
reporting date (12  July 2018) and the 
benchmark index is based on self- generated 
baskets of securities based on the respect-
ive ETFs (see the chart on p. 90).
As with stock ETFs, ETFs in the emerging 
market and corporate bond segments are 
shown to have greater liquidity than their

underlying reference assets. In the govern-
ment bond segment, however, there are no 
notable differences between the liquidity of 
ETFs and the corresponding basket of 
bonds. The bid- ask spread of the ETF track-
ing US  Treasuries, for example, is only 
slightly lower than that of its basket of 
secur ities, while the spreads of European 
and German government bond ETFs are somewhat higher than those of their under-
lying baskets.
With regard to the liquidity effects of ETFs 
on their underlying basket of securities, no 
defi  nitive conclusion has been reached. On 
the one hand, ETFs could cause liquidity to 
increase, as authorised participants (APs) 
can reduce or eliminate price differences Bid-ask spread of ETFs and the underlying benchmark indices

vidual securities; 10% of AUM) and the iShares Core  U.S. Aggregate (90 individual securities; 35% of AUM). If all securities in the ETFs 
had been included in the calculation for the benchmark indices – i.e. 100% of AUM – the result would probably have been higher bid-
ask spreads, as the securities not included tend to  have comparatively low liquidity (and therefore comparatively higher bid-ask spreads 
on an individual basis). As such, it is likely that  the difference between the benchmark index and the  ETF actually tends to be underesti-
mated for this group.

Even if the assumption of informationally effi -
cient markets charging no transaction costs 
does not hold, a passive investment strategy 
(using ETFs) can be optimal. To the extent that 
potential outperformance represents a zero-  
sum game – the excess return over the bench -
mark index achieved by some active fund man -
agers must be offset by other active fund man -
agers’ excess losses compared with the bench -
mark index – the average return generated by 
active management (excluding costs) would 
correspond to the return on the benchmark 
index, which can be replicated by an ETF.17 
Taking  management fees into account, then, 
the achievable average return would be lower 
for active investors than for passive investors.18
It is, however, conceivable that informed active 
fund managers systematically generate higher 
returns than other uninformed active invest -
ors.19 Furthermore, the zero- sum game argu -
ment only applies to static portfolios. Be that as 
it may, passive fund managers must also adapt their portfolios in practice – when index adjust -
ments are made, for example. This results in 
predictable trading patterns and creates par -
ticular profit opportunities for active managers. 
In summary, it can be concluded that there is 
limited opportunity, if indeed any, for active 
fund managers to systematically outperform 
the benchmark index. Even where this is pos -
sible, the resulting profit would have to cover 
the management fees charged by active invest -
ment funds.between ETF shares and the basket of 
secur ities via arbitrage.1 On the other hand, 
trading in ETF products could give rise to a 
crowding- out effect, whereby market par-
ticipants who would otherwise have traded 
individual securities directly may now invest 
indirectly via ETFs and thus divert liquidity 
away from the market for individual secur-
ities. This transmission mechanism could 
gain further signifi  cance given sustained 
growth in the ETF sector.
The analysis presented here shows that ETFs 
– at least those with high investment vol-
umes in calm market phases – have lower 
(normalised) bid- ask spreads than the aver-
age of their underlying individual securities. 
However, this “liquidity advantage” may dis-
sipate in times of market stress and could 
even be reversed in extreme cases.21 An analysis of the French CAC40 index reveals that 
the bid- ask spread narrows in the short and long term 
after the launch of an ETF. See R. De Winne, C. Gresse 
and I. Platten (2009), How Does the Introduction of an 
ETF Market with Liquidity Providers Impact the Liquid-
ity of the Underlying Stocks?, Working Paper.

see the box on pp. 97 ff.
17 An exception to this would be if non- investment fund 
investors systematically underperformed investors in open- 
end investment funds.

Usage
With regard to the use of ETFs, their great sig -
nificance for the allocation of capital must be 
stressed. ETFs are by no means a purely passive 
investment vehicle. Investors pursue an invest -
ment policy and must decide, for example, 
which region (e.g. Europe versus the United 
States) their ETF portfolio should be invested in, 
as well as choosing the level of specialisation 
(broad diversification versus niche investment) 
and an asset class (e.g. bonds or stocks). These 
decisions are usually made on the basis of the 
risk exposure and expected return on an inves -
tor’s portfolio.20 The passive element of an ETF 
is that the fund manager makes no active deci -
sions as to whether certain securities in an 
index should be overweighted at a certain 
point in time. The asset managers track the 
performance of the relevant index as precisely 
as possible in a purely passive manner. The 
combination of actively selecting a specific in -
vestment policy and passive fund management 
is also called a semi- active strategy.
Overall, ETFs can simplify investment processes. 
For example, it is far simpler to purchase an ETF 
for the DAX 30 than the 30 underlying index 
components. Even in the event of index adjust -
ments (for example, new weightings or risers/  
fallers), investors do not have to become ac -
tive. Furthermore, ETFs can facilitate market ac -
cess. Via ETFs investors can invest in otherwise 
less liquid investment segments such as corpor -
ate bonds. Constraints and barriers in certain 
countries, such as trading restrictions on secur -
ities or taxes, can also be overcome by means 
of synthetic replication by ETFs. Simplified in -
vestment processes via ETFs are also useful to 
small- scale investors or savers accumulating 
assets (to bolster pension provisions), as they 
can encourage a more balanced mix of invest -
ments.Structural trends
The structural trends identifiable in asset man -
agement over the past few years represent a 
further driver of ETF growth. Passive asset allo -
cation is increasingly becoming the preferred 
focus of the overall investment strategy (core 
investment). In addition, the low interest rate 
environment is shifting investors’ focus to the 
cost of investing. In the wake of the financial 
crisis, furthermore, adjustments were made to 
the regulatory framework (as part of Basel III, 
Solvency  II and MiFID II, for example), and this 
may have changed the investment behaviour 
of market participants. In this vein, some mar -
ket participants have since found investment in 
asset classes such as a direct investment in de -
rivatives to be a less attractive prospect, and 
ETFs may have profited from this. This could 
create an incentive to construct a similar risk/  
return profile using specific ETFs without dir -
ectly investing in the relevant asset class. The 
new sales channels established in the past few 
years, such as online banking and the emer -
gence of digital asset managers which use 
“robo advisors”,21 for instance, are likely to 
have contributed to the strong growth of ETFs.
Risks associated with ETFs
The risks associated with investing in ETFs 
should not be primarily assessed based on 
whether or not an investor could potentially 
suffer a financial loss. Individual securities and 
open- end investment funds are subject to con -
siderable price volatility which can give them Passive fund

profit and loss potential, and the same applies 
to ETFs. For instance, the market risk associated 
with an ETF investment cannot be regarded as 
a risk exclusive to ETFs. Rather, it is important 
to distinguish whether ETFs pose a particular 
additional risk compared with other asset 
classes – especially the individual securities in 
the benchmark index  – and whether certain 
risks have simply been insufficiently addressed. 
Against this backdrop, this article will examine 
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and risks related 
to price formation, including in the form of po -
tential procyclical developments in the financial 
markets. The phenomenon of common owner -
ship structures will also be touched upon in the 
context of ETFs.
Liquidity risk
Due to the particular structure of ETFs, with 
their primary/ secondary market mechanism, 
risks resulting from potential imbalances be -
tween the liquidity of the ETF and that of the 
underlying securities can arise. ETF providers 
may be obligated to buy back ETF shares on 
request at short notice. The risk here is that in 
the event of a price drop, the providers may be 
unable to liquidate the securities held in their 
portfolios in a timely manner. In a higher il -
liquidity scenario such as this, the trading price 
of ETF shares could fall below the value of the 
underlying portfolio (NAV). This is particularly 
problematic when investors take market condi -
tions in calm periods to draw conclusions about 
conditions amidst adverse market trends 
(known as the liquidity illusion). The liquidity 
transformation of relatively illiquid securities 
from an index into more liquid ETF shares, 
which is carried out when the market is calm, 
could quickly be reversed in periods of stress, 
should investors sell ETF shares on a large scale.
Problems can occur particularly with ETFs with 
less liquid underlying baskets of securities (e.g. 
corporate bond ETFs or emerging market ETFs). 
Here, there can be strong pressure to sell in 
times of market stress (for more on the behav -iour of ETFs in periods of market stress, see the 
box on pp. 97 ff.). Whilst investors in open- end 
investment funds can generally redeem their 
shares at the NAV, in the case of ETFs discrep -
ancies can arise between the NAV and the 
ETF’s trading price, which is the price relevant 
to the investor. If investors expect the ETF price 
on the stock exchange to fall below that of the 
underlying basket of securities, it would be ra -
tional for them to offload ETF shares as quickly 
as possible (first- mover advantage22), amplify -
ing negative price effects. This may result in the 
entire redemption process being brought for -
ward, thereby exacerbating liquidity problems 
or even creating such problems in the first 
place. Any pressure to sell could also be ampli -
fied due to a lack of dampening mechanisms in 
the ETF sector such as lock- up periods for 
hedge funds or minimum holding periods and 
redemption notice periods for real estate 
funds.23
The significance of authorised participants 
in times of market stress
In times of high market stress, falling prices and 
high volatility, there is a risk that APs will no 
longer fulfil their intended role as a link be -
tween the ETF secondary and primary markets. 
This is particularly important if APs assume a 
dual role, operating simultaneously as market 
makers on the secondary market. A lack of reli -
able price information about the underlying se -
curities or balance sheet restrictions may be 
responsible for this.24 It is also important to 
note that risks can be transferred from the ETF 
provider to the AP when performing cash Secondary

Report, April 2015, Chapter 3, pp. 101-103.

2011, p. 31.
24 Aside from this, APs could feel induced, under certain 
conditions, to utilise the ETF creation and redemption pro -
cess to manage portfolio risk, rather than attempting to 
offset mispricing in the markets. For more information, see 
K. Pan and Y. Zeng (2017), ETF arbitrage under liquidity

transactions on the primary market. The ETF 
provider initially assumes the price risks associ -
ated with trading the securities, for which it 
charges the AP a fee. Moreover, ETF providers 
often ask the AP to provide cash collateral, for 
example if trading in the underlying securities 
markets has closed due to time zone differ -
ences. In order to mitigate risk further still, 
some providers ultimately make contractual ar -
rangements reserving the right to switch from 
payment in cash to payment in kind (in ex -
change for securities).25 In this set- up, the se -
curities, and thus the price risk associated with 
the sale, pass completely from the ETF provider 
to the AP .
To account for this heightened risk, APs might 
respond by widening the bid- ask spread and/ or 
trading ETF shares at a considerable discount to 
the NAV. (Temporarily) suspending redemption 
of ETF shares would be another possible reac -
tion. As a result, the ETF’s NAV and the market 
price of the ETF shares could diverge further.26 
In addition, many APs trade with several ETFs, 
meaning that different funds could be affected 
by market tensions. Due to the critical signifi -
cance of APs, it would therefore be preferable 
for ETF providers to be affiliated with a large 
number of APs so that a possible withdrawal of 
an individual market player could be compen -
sated for more easily.27 However, this possibility 
could be severely limited for some market seg -
ments as precise knowledge of the specific 
market is needed for less liquid and/ or complex 
benchmark indices, which is expertise that po -
tentially only a few APs possess.
Due to the limited nature of disclosure require -
ments applying in this area, information avail -
able as to the number of APs that ETF providers 
are contractually linked with is by no means 
comprehensive. These data gaps make it hard 
to conduct a detailed analysis of such links. 
Where it is possible to obtain lists of ETF pro -
viders, these mostly constitute overviews of all 
of the APs with which an ETF company works 
for all of its ETF products and do not normally 
contain breakdowns showing which individual ETFs are linked to which APs. Information from 
studies and reported anecdotally by market 
participants indicates that there is significant 
variation in terms of the number of APs per 
ETF. While large ETFs will often have contract -
ual links with more than 30 APs, smaller niche 
ETFs (such as those for emerging markets) may 
have far fewer.28 But a simple statement of the 
number of APs contractually linked to an ETF 
does not reveal a great deal as to the actual 
activity levels of those APs. The number of ac -
tive APs is often fewer than five, and even less 
in the case of niche products.29 Adverse market 
developments, in particular, could see the num -
ber of APs which are actually active reduce still 
further – and even fall to zero in extreme cases. 
Given the major importance of APs as a link 
between the primary and secondary markets, it 
would be wise to work towards greater trans -
parency in terms of the (contracted) number of 
(active) APs per ETF.30
Safeguards in the event of disruption to 
the primary/ secondary market mechanism
While a total breakdown of AP activities seems 
unlikely, it cannot be entirely ruled out in an 
extreme stress scenario triggered by a systemic … can lead to 
discrepancies 
between the ETF 
price and its 
NAV
Number of APs 
per ETF varies25 Furthermore, some ETF providers can limit the daily 
redemp tion volume per AP or overall, or extend the repay -
ment deadline. This means that the provider has a longer 
period to sell securities, but leads to a delayed inflow of 
liquidity  for the AP .
26 Some trading platforms employ protective measures 
when faced with strong price fluctuations. For example, 
the trading platform Xetra has “circuit breakers” which 
interrupt continuous trading as soon as potential execution 
prices exceed predetermined price ranges. These are de -
fined on the basis of historical volatility.

event, for instance. In a case such as that, the 
only option left to ETF investors would be to 
return shares to the ETF provider directly. This 
process is governed by guidelines issued by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA).31 In their prospectuses and market 
communications, ETF providers should first 
draw attention to the fact that the purchase 
and sale of ETF shares usually takes place on 
the secondary market with the assistance of an 
intermediary, meaning that there can be dis -
crepancies between the NAV and ETF share 
prices. Where the value of the ETF shares varies 
significantly from the NAV – such as in the case 
of market disruption in the absence of a mar -
ket maker – the investor should be allowed to 
sell them back directly to the ETF provider. In 
situations such as this, the ETF provider would 
be obligated to inform its investors that they 
can opt to redeem their shares directly with the 
provider. The exact process and the costs in -
volved (which must not be excessive) should be 
disclosed in the ETF provider’s prospectus.
The option to return ETF shares directly to the 
ETF provider is an important feature for pro -
tecting private investors. Given this role, it is 
significant that the ESMA guidelines leave ETF 
providers with scope in terms of the precise im -
plementation. When exactly is the stock ex -
change value of the ETF shares classified as 
varying significantly from the NAV? When 
exactly does the ETF provider inform its cus -
tomers about the direct redemption option in 
the event of market disruption? What are the 
costs involved? These may be crucial aspects, 
for example. Furthermore, there are doubts as 
to whether private investors in particular are 
able to fully appreciate the sometimes complex 
interrelationships involved and evaluate them 
appropriately.
Trading halts are another form of safeguard. As 
the analysis of various flash crashes shows, 
they can help to stabilise the market when 
volatility increases during periods of stress (see 
the box on pp. 97 ff.).Counterparty risk
ETFs are exposed to counterparty risk, that is to 
say the risk that a counterparty may default. 
There is a distinction to be drawn between the 
risks in the case of physical ETFs and those as -
sociated with the synthetic breed. With phys -
ical ETFs, the counterparty risk stems from the 
securities lending transactions routinely in -
volved. These transactions are common prac -
tice in financial markets and feature in open-  
end investment fund activity and derivatives 
trading, too. The ETF provider lends stocks or 
bonds from the portfolio to another market 
player for a set period of time. In exchange for 
the securities it has lent, the ETF provider re -
ceives a fee as well as other securities as collat -
eral. According to industry data, profit made 
through securities lending typically accounts 
for around one- third of an ETF provider’s total 
revenue.32
If the counterparty then defaults, the borrowed 
security does not get returned to the ETF pro -
vider. In this case, the ETF provider is left with 
the securities that it received as collateral, 
which at the time of transaction are worth 
more than the lent securities on account of the 
standard practice of over- collateralisation. 
While this practice provides additional protec -
tion against falling prices, adverse market de -
velopments can potentially entail such steep 
price drops that the over- collateralisation 
proves insufficient and the ETF provider incurs 
losses through its securities lending oper -
ations.33 Via the primary/ secondary market ETF providers

mechanism, these losses in the ETF portfolio 
would end up being transferred to the ETF 
shares. In extreme scenarios, this could trigger 
general pressure to sell across the ETF sector, 
which would accelerate the price decline still 
further.34
The counterparty risk in the case of synthetic 
ETFs results from swap transactions. As in the 
case of physical ETFs, there is also the possibil -
ity that the collateral will turn out to be insuffi -
cient to offset losses in the event of counter -
party default, meaning that negative price dy -
namics could be triggered or catalysed with 
this type of ETF, too.
Furthermore, with synthetic ETFs there is the 
danger that the ETF provider may become un -
able to replicate the performance of the rele -
vant benchmark index in the event of a swap 
counterparty defaulting. If no new swap with a 
different market participant can be agreed, the 
ETF provider would have to sell the securities in 
its portfolio and, in turn, buy the securities of 
the benchmark index in order to achieve phys -
ical replication – so far as the possibility is even 
afforded given any barriers to entry or other 
market obstacles that might exist. This sort of 
process could lead to a loss of confidence – es -
pecially if several ETFs are affected at the same 
time – and thus, in a first step, trigger pressure 
to sell in the synthetic ETF segment. In a second 
step, the physical ETF segment could be hit by 
contagion effects if similar strategies are being 
pursued or as herd behaviour comes into play.
There are additional risks if the AP , swap coun -
terparty and/ or ETF provider are heavily inter -
connected. The swap counterparty and the AP 
could belong to the same banking group, for 
instance. While this may make for greater cost 
efficiency when it comes to collateral manage -
ment and refinancing,35 this kind of market 
structure can produce perverse incentives. For 
example, there is the risk that some banks 
might use illiquid securities to refinance them -
selves through swaps. Since related party trans -
actions are prohibited in the United States, this is a risk primarily for the European ETF mar -
ket.36 It must be said, however, that the num -
ber of ETF products offering synthetic replica -
tion has been waning in Europe in past years, 
which ought to significantly reduce the associ -
ated counterparty risk (see the upper panel of 
the chart on p. 84).
Influence on price formation
Results are inconclusive as to the impact of 
ETFs on price formation. First, it is possible that 
ETF-based mechanical index investment may 
stifle important price signals, which can lead to 
misallocation of capital. In the event of weak 
company performance, investors or fund man -
agers become unable to easily offload shares 
because they have to follow a prescribed 
weighting. This could compromise the informa -
tive function of prices. It should be stressed in 
this context, however, that passivity in pur -
chase decisions does not necessarily have to 
mean passivity on the part of ETF companies as 
regards managerial control. ETF companies in -
fluence corporate decisions by exercising vot -
ing rights in shareholders’ meetings.
It remains to be seen what size the ETF sector 
needs to reach before it starts having the po -
tential to impair the informative function of 
prices. But if the robust growth seen in the past 
few years persists, the importance of this issue 
looks set to grow.… it stems from

34 From a financial stability perspective, there could also 
end up being a shortage of collateral in the financial system 
if a large number of ETF providers (and other market par -
ticipants, too – those involved in derivatives transactions, 
for instance) were to simultaneously stop extending their 
securities lending transactions. See Financial Stability Board,

Exchange- traded funds in periods of market stress
On 6  May 2010 –  amid, amongst other 
things, concerns about the ongoing sover-
eign debt crisis in Greece – the prices of US 
stocks (as measured by the S&P 500) plum-
meted by around 5% within a very short 
space of time, having already fallen by 
around 4% over the course of the day. This 
meant a peak loss of 9% on the previous 
day’s closing prices (see the chart below). 
Prices recovered in minutes, with the index 
recording a daily loss of just over 3% as the 
markets closed. Against the backdrop of a 
weak market environment, the price col-
lapse was very probably due to the auto-
mated placing of sell orders for futures 
contracts , which then triggered corres-
ponding stop- loss orders. Amplifi  ed by 
high- frequency traders, these developments 
spilled over into the ETF markets.
The large number of sell orders caused bid- 
ask spreads to widen signifi  cantly. Market 
makers’ pricing models are important in this 
connection. The models they used here 
were partly responsible for signifi  cant differ-ences between the prices determined by 
market makers and the indicative net asset 
value (iNAV) of the ETFs concerned.1 As a 
result, market makers and APs withdrew 
from the market, liquidity dried up and 
some orders could no longer be executed.2 
While ETFs were hit harder by the “fl  ash 
crash” than other asset classes, it does not 
appear that they were the cause of it. In 
response to this event, a raft of regulations 
were introduced and existing regulations 
tightened in the United States. These in-
clude, in particular, “circuit breakers” that 
temporarily halt trading when prices hit pre-
defi  ned “tripwires”.3
On the morning of 24 August 2015, there 
was another fl  ash crash just as the markets 
opened. With a slump in prices on the Asian 
stock markets having caused futures prices 
to fall in Europe and the United States (the 
Chinese SSE Composite Index had tumbled 
by 8.5%), the S&P 500 in the United States 
opened 5.2% down on the previous day’s 
closing prices and temporarily plunged by 
7.8% in the space of fi  ve minutes. Most of 
these losses had been recouped by the 
1 Some market makers determine their ETF prices 
based on supply and demand only, without any regard  
for the underlying index values, while others take into 
account the value of the replicated basket of securities. 
However, the latter need time to evaluate information 
and price changes. If individual market makers with-
draw from the market, it can result in reduced  liquidity 
and larger price swings. For more infor mation, see

(SEC), US Commodity Futures Trading Commission:

quently cancelled were also ETF transactions. For more

put into effect  in 1987, they also set out requirements 
for risk management and rules on automated trading.Intraday price movements of the S&P

afternoon. Price swings in excess of prede-
fi  ned price changes triggered a total of 
1,278 trading halts – 1,058 of which were 
in the ETF and ETP sectors. These served to 
stabilise the markets.
Yet another fl  ash crash took place on 5 Feb-
ruary 2018 (for more information, see the 
box on pp. 86 f.). Suffering heavy intraday 
losses (-4%), S&P 500 prices dipped by 2.1% 
in a matter of minutes just after 15:00 local 
time, only to pick up again to pre- dip levels 
a short time later (see the chart on p. 86). 
The fl  ash crash appears to have been 
sparked by high volumes of accumulated 
VIX short positions combined with long 
positions in the S&P 500 stock market index, 
which, following a slow start to the trading 
day, reached their liquidation trigger thresh-
olds, provoking massive ETF sell orders in 
the process.4 Some of the long positions 
were in ETF portfolios, which could explain 
the downward pressure in this market seg-ment. To the extent that it is possible to 
comment without inspecting the order 
books, it appears that, measured by vol-
ume, the volatility of price movements dur-
ing and after this event was relatively mod-
erate (see the chart above). This could be 
an effect of the rules that were introduced 
and tightened in the wake of the fl  ash crash 
of 6 May 2010.
Although the circumstances surrounding 
each of the fl  ash crashes presented here are 
different, one commonality is the massive 
surge of automated sell orders that were 
activated. It seems that, while the market 
for ETFs played a major role in these devel-

BlackRock’s fi  gures, the trading volume of ETFs in the 
week of trading from 5 to 9 February 2018 was worth 
US$1,000 billion. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF recorded 
weekly outfl  ows of US$23.6 billion, which equates to 
around 8% of its market volume at that time. See

ETFs appear to have a positive impact on price 
formation due to the additional secondary 
market liquidity: market makers and APs carry 
over information available at the ETF level to 
the underlying securities, which can – in par -
ticular – speed up the price formation process, 
it seems. However, the structure of ETFs also 
allows non- fundamental liquidity shocks on the 
secondary market to be propagated to the indi -
vidual underlying securities. Moreover, owing 
to their low- cost nature, ETFs lend themselves 
to speculative purposes. Investors can bet on 
price trends over short horizons. This can pro -
duce non- fundamental price shocks which 
then propagate via the primary/ secondary mar -
ket mechanism to the individual securities that 
make up an index.37
Procyclical developments as a specific form 
of price formation risk
In the context of securities markets, the term 
procyclicality refers, in general, to a tendency towards reinforcement of existing trends. In re -
lation to ETFs, there is the potential danger that 
price developments in the financial markets 
could be amplified. For example, a fall in the 
price of individual securities belonging to the 
relevant benchmark index would, by definition, 
lead to a drop in price for that index. Valuation 
shifts in the benchmark index caused by the 
passive investment process can then call for ad -
justments to the ETF portfolio, which, under 
certain circumstances, may mean that the ETF 
provider needs to offload individual securities 
from the basket within a short space of time. 
The resulting procyclical developments could 
foster the build- up of potential risks in the fi -
nancial system, which could then spread 
throughout the system in times of stress.Additional

through ETFsopments, it did not trigger them. The mar-
ket structure – in particular, the ability to 
trade high- pressure asset classes at all times 
in conjunction with unstable market depth 
in the context of market- making activities – 
has proved to be a weakness. It can lead to 
differences between the price at which an 
ETF is exchange- traded and its iNAV, and 
cause the affected ETFs or their underlying 
securities to become increasingly volatile. 
The halts to trading existing on the Euro-
pean trading markets even prior to the fl  ash 
crashes and the tougher circuit breakers 
subsequently put in place on US stock mar-
kets to curb signifi  cant price drops there-
fore constitute an important safeguard 
against the rapid spread of distortions on 
the fi  nancial markets.
In addition to the “illusion of liquidity” – the 
problem of ETFs that are liquid during nor-
mal times merely appearing to remain liquid during periods of market stress – there are 
further risks. For example, there could be 
asymmetries in information processing be-
tween the ETF provider, the AP and/ or the 
end investor. It cannot be ruled out that, in 
times of stress, APs may be unable or un-
willing to absorb high order volumes in a 
short space of time. This could ultimately 
also result in APs demanding higher bid- ask 
spreads. ETFs with relatively illiquid assets 
(e.g. investments in emerging market econ-
omies or corporate bonds) are likely to be 
hit especially hard by this.

Common ownership
ETFs are a cost- effective means of diversifica -
tion. It has been shown that cost- effective op -
tions for diversification can be associated with 
a rise in common ownership structures.38 The 
term “common ownership structure” describes 
a situation where the shares of several enter -
prises belonging to the same sector are held by 
one asset manager. This set- up could lead to 
insufficient incentives for competition. When 
one enterprise acquires a greater market share 
by pursuing an aggressive competitive policy 
this leads to a reduced market share for an -
other enterprise from the same sector. A com -
mon owner – one who possesses (the same) 
shares in both enterprises – therefore does not 
benefit from an aggressive competitive policy 
of this kind. If common owners supplant indi -
vidual owners as the most powerful sharehold -
ers there are no longer any incentives to com -
pete. Negative consequences might include 
higher prices for consumers and a narrower 
range of products on offer. It is important to 
note here that there does not necessarily need 
to be any price collusion or cartel for these ef -
fects to arise.
Empirical studies indicate that, in certain sec -
tors, an increasing market concentration due to 
common ownership structures has led to climb -
ing consumer prices.39 It must be said that 
there are also those (in particular, major asset 
managers) who take a contrary view and adopt 
a critical stance towards the literature dealing 
with common ownership structures.40
Conclusion
ETFs are enjoying increasing popularity with in -
vestors as reflected in high growth rates, in -
cluding in comparison to open- end investment 
funds. Despite their growing importance, ETFs 
make up just under 14% of fund assets world -
wide, meaning that their role still ranks as 
lower- level. There appear to be a range of fac -
tors driving the fast- paced expansion of the ETF sector, chief among them –  at this point in 
time  – being the fact that they represent a 
cost- efficient means of investing in a diversified 
portfolio. They thus also open up access to 
market segments which are difficult to reach 
through other investment instruments. This 
may also have a bearing in terms of pension-  
related asset accumulation.
The prime factors determining the potential for 
profit, loss and risk of any given ETF are the 
underlying assets. Investing in ETFs can come 
with significant risks attached – for instance, if 
the selected benchmark index tracks a very 
high- risk asset class. Furthermore, some ETFs 
have particular features built in such as lever -
aged exposure or a structure offering inverse 
performance tracking of the benchmark index. 
When assessing the risks specific to ETFs as a 
product class, however, the underlying credit or 
market risk of the reference assets are less rele -
vant. The most pressing issue here is whether 
ETFs may be a source of additional risks when 
compared with other asset classes, such as 
open- end investment funds or individual secur -
ities.
Overall – and partly because the sector is still 
relatively small – the specific risks for the finan -
cial system associated with ETFs appear limited 
for now. However, analysis of various flash 
crashes suggests that there is the potential for 
episodes of pronounced financial market ten -
sion to be amplified in the short term. The 
complex structure of ETFs, including the pri -
mary/ secondary market mechanism, makes the 
task of risk assessment harder and may harbour 
liquidity risk. In that regard, APs occupy a key 
position in the system. Disruption to the proper ETFs can 
encourage  com -

functioning of APs may result in the ETF and 
the benchmark index drifting apart in price 
terms. In the past, such disturbances have been 
limited to just a few minutes. However, it can -
not be ruled out that – particularly in the case 
of systemic stress events  – longer- lasting 
periods of dwindling market liquidity or sus -
tained negative price dynamics, including an 
increase in volatility extending beyond the 
short term, may occur. It should be borne in 
mind that the strong growth of ETFs did not set 
in until after the financial crisis of 2008; the 
sector, with its new- found significance, has yet 
to be exposed to more sustained market dis -
ruption.
A number of mechanisms already exist to keep 
ETFs working smoothly. In the event of a vola -
tility spike in stress periods, halts to trading 
seem to be able to help stabilise the market. In 
addition, a large number of active APs per ETF appears to be important for ensuring that the 
primary/ secondary market mechanism remains 
able to function when adverse market develop -
ments occur. It would be good to see more 
transparency on the part of ETF providers here, 
especially concerning the links between ETF 
providers and APs as well as the detailed ar -
rangements applying to the option for ETF 
shares to be returned to the ETF provider as 
laid down in the ESMA guidelines.
In addition to liquidity risk, ETFs also involve 
counterparty risk stemming from securities 
lending or swap transactions. Risks related to 
price formation can emerge in particular if ETFs 
used for speculative purposes propagate liquid -
ity shocks on the secondary market to the indi -
vidual underlying securities. Lastly, ETFs appear 
to foster common ownership structures, which 
could dampen incentives for competition in 
corporate sectors.Safeguard
