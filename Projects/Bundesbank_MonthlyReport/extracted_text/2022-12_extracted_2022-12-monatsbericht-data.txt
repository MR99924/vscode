Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic data for the German economy sent 
mixed signals at the start of the fourth quarter 
of 2022. On an average of October and No -
vember, enterprises were significantly less satis -
fied with their business situation than in the 
third quarter, according to the ifo Institute. 
Output figures for October brought a positive 
surprise, however. This is particularly true of the 
main construction sector, which recorded a 
marked increase despite sharply declining new 
orders. Industry kept its output at roughly the 
same level as in the third quarter, although 
energy- intensive sectors continued to contract 
significantly. By contrast, retail sales continued 
their steep decline – both in nominal and in 
real terms. Consumers showed a marked hesi -
tance to buy, with high inflation diminishing 
their purchasing power and concerns about 
high energy costs dampening their propensity 
to spend. In November, the consumer climate 
index compiled by the market research institute 
GfK departed only slightly from its record low 
in October. Enterprises’ business expectations 
as surveyed by the ifo Institute also improved 
somewhat in November, but were still very pes -
simistic. Economic output in Germany is likely 
to decline in the fourth quarter on the whole, 
although probably somewhat less sharply than 
previously expected.1
Industry
In October 2022, seasonally adjusted2 industrial 
output fell a little short of the September level 
(-½%), although this September figure was also 
revised upwards significantly. Output increased 
slightly compared with the third-  quarter aver -
age, however (+¼%). A dichotomy between 
sectors is evident. In the energy- intensive sec -
tors,3 especially in the chemicals industry, out -put fell sharply again, while continuing to fare 
well in the other industrial sectors. Production 
of intermediate goods declined overall, but 
much less sharply than in the energy- intensive 
sectors, all of which are included here. For 
intermediate goods that are not classified as 
energy- intensive, the manufacture of fabri -
cated metal products rose, for example, driven 
by massive increases in weapons and ammuni -
tion. Consumer goods production remained 
roughly at the same level as the third quarter 
but production of capital goods increased sig -
nificantly. In particular, the manufacture of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts was 
well above the third- quarter average in Octo -
ber. According to data on passenger car pro -
duction provided by the German Association of 
the Automotive Industry (VDA), the automotive 
industry is likely to have performed well in No -
vember, too. These figures show that the pro -
duction level was significantly higher than that 
of October. Overall, despite the tight energy 
supply and high costs, industry is likely to come 
through the fourth quarter relatively unscathed.
Industrial new orders stabilised again some -
what in October, following substantial declines 
in August and September. They were up slightly 
on the previous month in seasonally adjusted 
terms (+¾%). However, the order level re -
mained well below the average of the third 
quarter (-2%). Excluding large orders, new 
orders were down even more markedly (-2¾%).

have a delayed impact on the production fig -German eco -

chemicals and chemical products, the manufacture of basic 
metals, the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum 
products, the manufacture of non- metallic mineral prod -
ucts, and the manufacture of paper and paperboard.Deutsche Bundesbank

ures compared with other orders. Broken down 
by region, incoming orders from both Germany 
and abroad declined distinctly, with a compara -
tively strong drop in orders from the euro area. 
Broken down by sector, new orders were con -
siderably lower for intermediate goods and 
somewhat lower for capital goods. The inflow 
of orders stagnated in the case of consumer 
goods. Among producers of capital goods, 
however, the automotive industry and manu -
facturers of other transport equipment received 
more orders than the average of the third quar -
ter.
In October, industrial sales were up only slightly 
on the month in seasonally adjusted terms 
(+¼%). Compared with the third- quarter aver -
age, however, they were distinctly higher 
(+1¼%) and even after price adjustment, there 
was still a small rise (+½%). This increase was 
mainly driven by foreign sales, particularly to 
non- euro area countries. Broken down by sec -
tor, sales of capital goods rose steeply in line 
with production. In particular, sales of other 
transport equipment, mainly in the building of 
ships and boats, were very significantly higher 
in October than the third- quarter average. The 
automotive industry also saw a significant in -
crease in sales. By contrast, consumer goods 
producers posted only a slight uptick in sales. 
Sales of intermediate goods were down some -
what, with chemical products experiencing a 
strong decline.
Nominal exports rose slightly in October com -
pared with the previous month (seasonally ad -
justed +¾%) and significantly compared with 
the average of the third quarter (+1½%). The 
increase was even more pronounced after price 
adjustment due to falling export prices. This 
was partly due to decreasing prices for energy 
exports, as natural gas became significantly 
cheaper in October. By contrast, there was no 
decline in export prices for intermediate, con -
sumer and capital goods. Broken down by 
country group, nominal exports to the euro ar -
ea’s partner countries were weak. However, ex -

offset this decline. In October, nominal imports 
were considerably lower than in the previous 
month (seasonally adjusted -2¼%) and the 
average of the third quarter (-2%). After price 
adjustment, the decrease was somewhat 
smaller, as import prices for energy and inter -
mediate goods fell in October. Unlike in the 
case of exports, nominal imports from non-  
euro area countries were particularly weak, al -
though imports from the euro area were able 
to mitigate the decline somewhat. Roughly the 
same amount was spent on Russian goods in 
October (€1.79 billion) as in September. In Au -
gust, before the complete suspension of nat -
ural gas deliveries, the figure had been €2.83 
billion.
Construction
Construction output rose steeply in October. It 
was up by 4¼% on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms and by around 3¼% on the third 
quarter. The increase was surprisingly substan -
tial in both the main construction sector and 
the finishing trades. In the short term, the fa -
vourable weather conditions probably had a 
positive impact on activity in the main con -
struction sector. According to ifo Institute sur -
veys, disruption to construction activity due to 
weather conditions was well below the long-  
term monthly average in October. The share of 
enterprises affected by a shortage of materials 
also declined again recently. However, the posi -
tive development in October is unlikely to con -
tinue. High construction prices and lending 
rates are tending to depress demand, suggest -
ing a slowdown in construction activity.4 Ac-
cording to the ifo Institute, the assessment of 
the business situation improved slightly in No -
vember but it remained at an exceptionally low 
level. In addition, the number of construction 
firms complaining of a lack of orders was al -
ready significantly higher in November than in 
the previous months. This is also a reflection of 
the downward trend in new orders in the main 
construction sector over the past few months.Labour market
Employment was up distinctly in October in 
seasonally adjusted terms, after having re -
mained unchanged in the third quarter. Given 
the gloomier economic outlook and the sub -
stantial increase in the minimum wage in Octo -
ber, this illustrates how extraordinarily stable 
the German labour market is. The number of 
persons in work went up by 32,000 on the 
month. Employment subject to social security 
contributions also grew somewhat more 
strongly in September (more recent data are 
unavailable at present) than on average in the 
previous months. However, take-  up of short-  
time work was once again stronger than it has 
been recently. In September, the number of 
persons in short- time work doubled on the 
month, albeit from a relatively moderate level. 
The employment outlook improved again in 
November. In particular, the ifo employment 
barometer, which had previously fallen signifi -
cantly, saw a distinct recovery and now lies in 
expansionary territory.
Registered unemployment rose slightly by 
17,000 persons to 2.54 million in November 
after adjustment for seasonal variations. The 
unemployment rate was up by 0.1 percentage 
point to 5.6%. Ukrainian refugees did not 
cause an increase, as some of the refugees 
from the war dropped out of the unemploy -
ment statistics by joining language and integra -
tion courses. Total underemployment went up 
more strongly as a result, as that figure includes 
persons involved in active labour market policy 
measures and in integration measures. The 
slight increase likewise recorded in registered 
unemployment in the statutory unemployment 
insurance scheme suggests that the high level 
of labour market tightness is easing as the 
economy slows down. This process is likely to 
continue over the next few months as well, ac -
cording to the unemployment barometer of 
the Institute for Employment Research (IAB).

to develop, this cannot be taken to indicate a 
strong short- term increase in unemployment.
Prices
The price of crude oil continued to come under 
marked pressure recently. Various factors came 
into play here. The subdued global economy 
weighed on oil demand. The G7 nations agreed 
on a relatively high price cap for Russian crude 
oil, which is unlikely to curtail Russia’s crude oil 
exports all that much. In addition, at the start of 
December, OPEC member states and their part -
ners decided not to cut their own production 
any more than previously planned for the time 
being. As this report went to press, a barrel of 
Brent crude oil cost US$82. Crude oil futures 
were trading at minimal discounts, amounting 
to US$3½ for deliveries 12 months ahead. By 
contrast, European wholesale gas prices have 
risen significantly in recent weeks to €139 per 
megawatt hour due to the cold weather. This is 
around 36% more than last year.
At the upstream stages of the economy, the ex -
ceptionally high price pressures by historical 
standards recently eased somewhat. In Octo -
ber, prices in European gas markets in particu -
lar experienced a significant fall compared with 
the previous month. This was reflected in a fur -
ther marked reduction in the price of energy 
imports. In addition, domestic energy prices 
came down for the first time. Year- on- year in -
flation was 23.5% for imports and 34.5% for 
domestic products. In both cases, this was 
markedly lower than in September. Alongside 
energy, price increases for imports and produc -
tion of intermediate goods declined again 
somewhat, while the rate of price increase for 
capital and consumer goods remained un -
changed at a high level.
In November, consumer price inflation weak -
ened and the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) rose by just 0.4% on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms. The year- on- year in -
crease was still in the double digits, however, and amounted to 11.3%, down from 11.6% in 
October.5 In particular, the extremely strong 
energy inflation decreased somewhat, al -
though the already very high growth in food 
prices picked up once more. The increase in 
prices of industrial goods and services was simi -
larly significant to October. The core rate (ex -
cluding energy and food) thus remained at 
5.1% in November. Inflation rates are likely to 
become significantly more volatile in the com -
ing months. The first stage of the gas price 
brake envisages the government paying gas 
bills in December. This could push the inflation 
rate down into single digits. Starting in January, 
inflation is set to then rise again markedly, al -
though the second stage of the gas price brake 
and the electricity price brake are likely to 
dampen the inflation rate already. Overall, there 
is still a high degree of uncertainty about price 
developments in the coming months. Besides 
the uncertainties surrounding the inclusion of 
the price brakes in the official price statistics, 
one of the factors contributing to this is the 
plan to rebase the national consumer price 
index to base year 2020 with effect from Janu -
ary 2023. Nevertheless, the underlying infla -
tionary pressures in Germany are likely to re -
main high for the time being.6

health fund) posted a surplus of €½ billion in 
the third quarter of 2022. Without lagged cen -
tral government refunds, the surplus would 
have amounted to €1 billion. This result marks 
a significant improvement on the third quarter 
of 2021, when a deficit of €3 billion was re -
corded. Additional central government grants 
are the main reason for this positive develop -
ment. These grants are intended to offset the 
health insurance institutions’ funding gap ex -
pected back in autumn 2021 by the group of 
statutory health insurance estimators in order 
to stabilise supplementary contribution rates. 
The funding gap is predominantly structural in 
nature. In the previous year, the health insur -
ance institutions covered the funding gap using 
their reserves.
The statutory health insurance scheme’s rev -
enue was up by 7% on the same quarter of 
2021, not least because of higher central gov -
ernment payments. Central government issued 
an additional grant of €3½ billion. In 2022, it is 
paying additional grants totalling €14 billion in 
quarterly instalments. In 2021, central govern -
ment paid an additional grant of €5 billion in 
the first quarter only. By contrast, its refunds for 
pandemic-  related special expenditure fell by 
€1½ billion. Contribution receipts grew by 
5½%, bolstered in part by the large pension in -
crease at mid- year. Average supplementary 
contribution rates – which were up slightly, by 
0.1 percentage point – contributed only ½ per -
centage point to this.
The expenditure of the statutory health insur -
ance scheme rose moderately, by 2%. The 
health fund’s falling pandemic- related pay -
ments had an easing effect. This pandemic-  
related expenditure was mainly due to corona -
virus tests for the general public (€1½ billion), 
financial assistance to hospitals and the fund’s 
share of vaccination costs (€½ billion in each 
case). In addition, there were special payments 
of €½ billion to nursing staff providing long-  
term care. These special payments had not yet 
been reimbursed by central government, lead -
ing to a temporary negative impact on the re -sult. Health insurance institutions’ spending on 
benefits climbed by 4%. In this context, base 
effects in opposing directions make it difficult 
to assess the underlying developments in the 
individual benefit areas. Overall, expenditure on 
benefits was 14½% higher than in the same 
quarter of the pre- crisis year of 2019.8 Adminis -
trative expenditure grew by just over 5% on 
the year.

This would be a considerable improvement on 
the previous year (deficit of €5½ billion for 
2021 according to final accounting figures). In 
the autumn of 2021, the group of statutory 
health insurance estimators expected a deficit 
of €2 billion for 2022. The better- than-  
projected developments are mainly due to a 
stronger rise in earnings subject to compulsory 
contributions. Furthermore, the average sup -
plementary contribution rate is just under 
0.1  percentage point higher than estimated. 
However, expenditure rose somewhat more 
sharply after the first three quarters than pro -
jected in autumn 2021 by the group of statu -
tory health insurance estimators for the year as 
a whole.9 Overall, a surplus of just over €2 bil -
lion is thus on the cards for 2022.
For 2023, the assumptions made by the group 
of statutory health insurance estimators in the 
autumn of 2022 anticipate a large deficit of €7 
billion in the statutory health insurance scheme. 
The lion’s share (€5 billion) is attributable to the 
health fund. According to the estimators’ as -
sumptions, this deficit corresponds to the avail -
able funds in the health fund’s liquidity reserve 
at the end of 2022. The applicable new min -
imum reserve is 50% lower, at 0.25 times the 
scheme’s monthly expenditure. For the last 
time, the fund will transfer funds to compen -
sate the health insurance institutions for losses 
caused by the reduction of statutory health in -
surance contributions on occupational pen -
sions since 2020, drawing on its liquidity re -
serve (€½ billion). In addition, the health insur -
ance institutions will receive a one- off special 
grant of €4½ billion. However, the deficit could 
still be just over €1 billion higher than pro -
jected, due to the fact that the health fund will 
still transfer just over €½ billion from its liquid -
ity reserve to the Innovation Fund and the 
Structural Fund. Moreover, the health insurance 
institutions will receive an additional €½ billion 
from this for improvements in the areas of ob -
stetrics and paediatrics. As the health fund is 
likely to close 2022 in a better position than 
projected by the group of estimators, the liquidity reserve is nonetheless unlikely to fall 
below its minimum level.
The smaller part of the statutory health insur -
ance scheme’s deficit is attributable to the 
health insurance institutions. The group of 
statutory health insurance estimators expects 
the institutions’ spending to rise by 4½% in 
2023 despite savings, above all in the area of 
pharmaceuticals. On the revenue side, the 
health insurance institutions will receive contri -
bution receipts and central government funds. 
The latter (excluding pandemic- related refunds) 
will fall by €11 billion on the year.10 Transfers 
from the health fund’s liquidity reserve will in -
crease to the aforementioned €5 billion. In 
order to limit the necessary rise in the supple -
mentary contribution rate, the health insurance 
institutions are supposed to withdraw €2½ bil -
lion from their reserves. These funds will be re -
distributed among the health insurance institu -
tions.11 In addition, the upper limit on reserves 
will be lowered from 0.8 to 0.5 times the 
scheme’s monthly expenditure. If a health in -
surance institution then still has remaining 
funding gaps, it must close them by raising its 
supplementary contribution rate as necessary. 
The Federal Ministry of Health accordingly 
raised the supplementary contribution rate for 
2023 by 0.3 percentage point to 1.6%.
For 2023, the government is focusing mainly

funding gap. In doing so, it is putting off taking 
action that is fundamentally necessary. As 
things stand, in 2024 all special payments from 
central government will have come to an end 
and, according to the plans, the buffers in the 
reserves will have been used up. As the under -

sures on the (supplementary) contribution rates 
will then increase. The Federal Minister of 
Health has therefore announced a comprehen -
sive financial reform for next year. Hospital re -
muneration is also expected to change, albeit 
without impacting on the scheme’s finances 
overall.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The core budget of the public long- term care 
insurance scheme was €1½ billion in deficit in 
the third quarter of 2022.12 This constitutes a 
deterioration of €1 billion compared with the 
same quarter of the previous year and is mainly 
due to additional expenditure generated by the 
recent reform of long- term care.
Revenue rose by 8½%, with contribution re -
ceipts growing by 6%. Almost 1  percentage 
point of this increase was due to the fact that 
the contribution rate for childless persons also 
rose by 0.1 percentage point to 3.4% at the be -
ginning of the year as part of the benefit re -
form. Alongside contribution receipts, central 
government provided additional funds of €½ 
billion in order to pay a bonus to nursing staff 
providing long- term care.
At 15%, growth in expenditure was much 
stronger still. Coronavirus- related special pay -
ments increased by one- third, in connection 
with the bonuses paid to nursing staff provid -
ing long- term care.13 However, the rise in other 
expenditure was also strong, at 13%, which 
was mainly attributable to spending on inpa -
tient care (+24%). The reason for this is the re -
form of long- term care: since the beginning of 
this year, the long- term care insurance scheme 
has been taking on a greater share of the costs 
as the length of residence in long-term care 
homes increases.14 In the draft law, the Federal 
Government projected additional expenditure 
of €2½ billion in 2022 for this purpose. How -Considerable

12 The developments outlined here and in the remainder 
of the text exclude the provident fund. Since 2015, this 
fund has been receiving transfers from the core area cor -
responding to receipts of 0.1 percentage point of the con -
tribution rate. Assets accumulated in this way are to be de -
pleted in the 2030s to dampen the expected contribution 
rate rise.
13 Other special payments to long- term care facilities and 
for coronavirus tests remained broadly unchanged. Overall, 
they amounted to €1½ billion. The long- term care insur -
ance scheme reimbursed non- residential and (semi-)resi -
dential long- term care facilities for coronavirus testing 
costs. Furthermore, these facilities received financial com -
pensation for additional expenditure relating to the pan -
demic. They were also compensated for revenue shortfalls 
caused by the non- utilisation of long- term care services on 
account of the pandemic. But even if there had been no 
pandemic, the long- term care insurance scheme’s spend -
ing on benefits would still have been higher.
14 The co- contribution rate of long- term care recipients 
drops to 30% after a three- year period of residence. The 
limitation on residents’ co-  contribution does not apply to 
fees for accommodation, food and investment.Deutsche Bundesbank

ever, the outturns for the first three quarters of 
the year point to markedly higher expenditure. 
Cash benefits continued to grow by a substan -
tial 7% even though benefit rates remained un -
changed.
A deficit appears to be on the cards for the 
year as whole, although it will probably be 
markedly smaller than in 2021 (€1½ billion). 
The sharp increase in spending on benefits 
would normally have led to a significantly 
higher deficit. Furthermore, coronavirus- specific 
expenditure increased. Under the 2022 long-  
term care reform, central government provides 
a regular grant of €1 billion. In addition to this, 
however, it paid further grants amounting to 
just over €2 billion, as well as issuing a loan of 
€1 billion this year, to be repaid by the end of 
2023. The significant growth in earnings sub -
ject to compulsory contributions over the year 
as a whole is another positive influence.
Although costs arising from special coronavirus 
payments will be absent next year, the long-  
term care insurance scheme will nevertheless 
be in structural deficit. In addition, the Federal 
Minister of Health plans to expand benefits 
again in mid- 2023. Amongst other things, 
long- term care rates are then set to rise. In 
addition, the long- term care insurance scheme 
will have to repay the central government loan 
granted in 2022. Overall, available reserves will 
probably already be used up in the first half of 
2023. A higher contribution rate would then 
be needed to close the funding gap.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €174.0 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in October 2022 was up on the 
previous month (€159.4 billion). After deduct -
ing redemptions, which were somewhat lower 
than in September, and taking account of 
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own debt 
securities, net issuance of domestic debt secur -ities came to €61.7 billion. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign debt securities in Germany fell 
by €1.0 billion in the reporting month, pushing 
up the outstanding volume of debt instruments 
in the German market by €60.7 billion overall.
During the reporting month, the public sector 
increased its capital market debt by €61.0 bil -
lion net (following net redemptions of €20.9 
billion in September). On balance, central gov -
ernment issued primarily ten- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds: €39.0 billion), 30- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds: €8.0 billion), two- year Treasury 
notes (Schätze: €8.3 billion) and Treasury dis -
count paper (Bubills: €6.2 billion). This con -
trasted with net redemptions of five- year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls) amounting to €8.2 billion. 
State and local governments issued bonds 
worth €2.2 billion net.
Domestic credit institutions pared back their 
capital market debt by €6.2 billion in the month 
under review, compared with borrowing activ -
ity amounting to €32.1 billion in the previous 
month. In this context, the outstanding volume 
of debt securities issued by specialised credit in -
stitutions – which also include public promo -
tional banks  – fell by €9.8 billion. Mortgage 
Pfandbriefe and public Pfandbriefe were issued 
in the amount of €3.4 billion and €0.2 billion 
net, respectively.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds worth €6.8 
billion net in October, compared with €3.9 bil -
lion in the previous month. Overall, this was 
entirely attributable to issuances by other finan -
cial institutions, which on balance solely issued 
bonds with maturities of up to one year.
On balance, domestic non-  banks were the 
main buyers of debt securities in the month 
under review, adding a net €73.7 billion in 
bonds to their portfolios. These consisted en -
tirely of domestic debt securities on balance.

Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises placed only 
small quantities of new shares in the German 
equity market (€0.6 billion, following €38.8 bil -
lion in the previous month). The volume of for -
eign equities in the German market fell by €3.5 
billion during the same period. Ultimately, 
shares were purchased solely by non- resident 
investors (€2.2 billion). Domestic non- banks 
sold shares worth €3.5 billion on balance, in -
cluding domestic shares worth €1.6 billion. Do -
mestic banks offloaded solely foreign assets 
(-€1.6 billion).
Mutual funds
Domestic investment funds recorded net in -
flows of €4.0 billion in October (previous 
month: €1.3 billion). On balance, specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors were 
the chief beneficiaries of such inflows (€3.6 bil -
lion). By contrast, retail funds sold their own 
certificates only to a small extent (€0.3 billion). 
Among the fund providers, the main sellers of 
new shares were mixed securities funds (€11.4 
billion), followed to a lesser extent by real es -
tate funds (€2.0 billion) and bond funds (€1.1 
billion). By contrast, funds of funds redeemed 
their own shares to the tune of €7.9 billion net. 
The outstanding volume of foreign mutual 
fund shares distributed in Germany increased 
by €1.0 billion in October. Domestic non- banks 
were almost the sole buyers of mutual fund 
shares on balance (€5.7 billion). Foreign invest -
ors pared back their domestic fund portfolios 
by €0.8 billion in net terms, while domestic 
credit institutions left their holdings virtually 
unchanged on balance.Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €5.9 billion in October 2022, almost half of 
the previous month’s result. This was caused by 
the narrower surplus in the goods account and 
the shift into a deficit in invisible current trans -
actions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income.
In October, the surplus in the goods account 
fell by €3.7 billion to €6.4 billion because re -
ceipts recorded a sharper decrease than ex -
penditure.
Invisible current transactions shifted from a sur -
plus of €1.5 billion in September into a deficit 
of €0.5 billion. Net receipts in primary income 
in fact grew by €0.4 billion to €11.3 billion, 
with expenditure narrowing somewhat more 
sharply than receipts. However, the deficit in

cantly by €1.3 billion to stand at €5.3 billion. 
The main reason for this was lower receipts, 
with reduced government income from current 
taxes on income and wealth playing a role. In 
addition, expenditure rose somewhat. Al -
though payments to the EU budget in connec -
tion with financing related to gross national in -
come went down, general government ex -
penditure on current transfers relating to inter -
national cooperation recorded significant 
growth. Moreover, the deficit in the services 
account expanded by €1.2 billion to €6.5 bil -
lion. Receipts, in particular, declined, with 
lower receipts in transport and charges for the 
use of intellectual property contributing to this 
contraction. The increase in travel expenditure 
counteracted the predominantly receding ex -
penditure in other areas.
In October 2022, financial markets were dom -
inated by high global inflation rates and ex -
pectations of further monetary policy tighten -
ing in the major economies. Germany’s cross-  
border portfolio investment generated net cap -
ital exports of €15.4 billion (September: net 
capital imports of €7.6 billion). Non- resident in -
vestors reduced their holdings of German 
securities by €19.3 billion, disposing of money 
market paper in particular (€17.9 billion), but 
also selling bonds (€3.0 billion) and a small vol -
ume of mutual fund shares (€0.8 billion). By 
contrast, they purchased shares of German en -
terprises to the tune of €2.4 billion. Resident in -
vestors parted with foreign securities (€3.9 bil -
lion) on balance, offloading shares (€3.9 billion) 
and money market paper (€2.4 billion), whilst 
acquiring bonds (€1.4 billion) and mutual fund 
shares (€1.0 billion). In October, transactions in 
financial derivatives recorded outflows of €5.2 
billion (September: €10.5 billion).
Direct investment recorded net capital exports

Outlook for the German economy  
for 2023 to 2025
While the German economy is likely to contract in the current winter half-year, it will not experi -
ence a severe downturn. Due to additional gas imports from other countries as well as reduced 
consumption, a gas shortage is unlikely to occur despite the cessation of deliveries from Russia. 
However, the energy crisis will boost inflation. As a result, real disposable income and household 
consumption will fall until mid- 2023. High energy costs will weigh on production, especially in 
energy- intensive industry. This will dampen exports. In addition, foreign demand will wane. The 
elevated level of uncertainty and higher financing costs will depress investment amongst enter -
prises and in housing construction. Real government consumption will decline as pandemic-  
related spending comes to an end.
From the second half of 2023 onwards, the German economy will gradually recover. This is 
because foreign demand is expected to rise, uncertainty will abate, price pressures from energy 
commodities will diminish, and the rate of inflation will fall. As the labour market will remain 
robust and wages will see strong growth, real household income and private consumption will 
increase again.
In these circumstances, the German economy will contract by 0.5% in calendar- adjusted terms 
next year, after expanding by 1.8% this year. It will grow by 1.7% in 2024 and by 1.4% in 2025. 
Macroeconomic production capacity will not return to normal levels of utilisation until 2025. 
Compared with the June projection, the rate of change in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2023 
has been revised considerably downwards. This is due to the massive deterioration in conditions 
regarding the supply of energy, weaker growth in foreign demand, and higher financing costs.
The rate of inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is expected 
to be 8.6% this year. It will fall to 7.2% next year, partly because of the government’s electricity 
and gas price brake. Inflation rates will continue to decline in the following years. The headline 
rate will diminish to 2.8% by 2025. By contrast, the core rate (excluding energy and food) will first 
continue to rise slightly in 2023, climbing to 4.3%. It will subsequently decline to 2.6% by 2025. 
Price inflation, however, will remain high owing to the pressure from labour costs as well as to 
rebound effects after the electricity and gas price brake has expired. Compared with the June pro -
jection, both the headline and core rates have been revised markedly upwards again for every 
year.
The government will provide substantial support to enterprises and households during the energy 
crisis, especially in the form of broad- based subsidies and other transfers. At the same time, the 
measures related to the pandemic will come to an end. On balance, the deficit will rise from 
2¾% of GDP this year to 4% next year. Thereafter, the support measures will be gradually phased 
out and the deficit will fall to around 1½% of GDP.
The risks to economic growth are tilted predominantly to the downside, mainly due to potential 
shortages in the supply of energy. With regard to inflation, upside risks predominate.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy grew markedly over the 
2022 summer half- year (April-  September). Des -
pite the crisis in the energy markets caused by 
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, 
GDP growth was only slightly lower in real 
terms than had been expected in the June pro -
jection.2 Private consumption expenditure rose 
as anticipated, despite higher rates of inflation 
and rising consumer uncertainty. In this con -
text, roles are likely to have been played by un -
expectedly strong catch- up effects following 
the expiration of most of the pandemic con -
tainment measures as well as by additional 
government assistance measures. Investment, 
by contrast, was lacking. In particular, the 
housing sector was impeded to a larger extent 
by the very sharp increase in construction prices 
and higher interest rates.
With the cessation of gas deliveries from Russia 
to Germany, the key downside risk of the June 
projection became a reality. As a result, the 
spot market prices for both gas as well as elec -
tricity initially rose extremely sharply before fall -
ing significantly again. Furthermore, the uncer -
tainty surrounding the energy supply and its 
costs considerably depressed the sentiment 
amongst enterprises and households. However, 
the outlook for the supply of gas, even without deliveries from Russia, is now less critical than 
had been feared in June. This is due to add -
itional deliveries from other countries, a signifi -
cant reduction in gas consumption, and the 
fact that gas storage facilities are well stocked 
as a result. A gas shortage and an accompany -
ing rationing of gas supplies have therefore be -
come much less likely and are not assumed in 
the projection.3 In order to mitigate the eco -
nomic impact on households and enterprises 
resulting from the sharp rise in energy costs, 
the Federal Government also initiated extensive 
support measures, particularly the electricity 
and gas price brake (see pp. 23 f.).
The German economy is likely to contract in 
the current winter half- year. However, it is not 
experiencing a severe economic downturn, 
which had been forecast by the adverse scen -
ario in the June projection, for example.4 Eco-
nomic activity is likely to see a marked decline 
as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. Accord -
ing to the ifo Institute, enterprises’ assessments 
of the business situation are deteriorating. The 
Bundesbank’s weekly activity index (WAI) also 
shows a declining trend.5 Although enterprises’ 
business expectations as surveyed by the ifo In -
stitute recently brightened somewhat, they re -
main highly pessimistic. This also holds true for Despite the

Deutsche Bundesbank1 This projection for Germany was finalised on 30 Novem -
ber 2022. It was incorporated into the projections for the 
euro area published by the ECB on 15 December 2022.

3 The assumptions regarding gas consumption that under -
lie the baseline scenario of this projection are based on the 
reductions in gas consumption observed since the cessa -
tion of gas deliveries from Russia. It is assumed that this 
and next winter will experience averagely low tempera -
tures. Furthermore, it is assumed that there will be add -
itional imports of gas (for example in the form of liquefied 
natural gas). For an adverse risk scenario that includes less 
favourable assumptions regarding the gas supply, amongst 
other factors, see the box on pp. 39 ff.
4 The adverse scenario of the June projection incorporates 
other unfavourable assumptions alongside the cessation of 
gas deliveries from Russia. However, not all of these have 
fully materialised. For instance, there was no significant rise 
in the price of oil nor a slump in global economic activity. 
See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022b).
5 When this projection was finalised, the WAI included 
high- frequency indicators, such as the toll index and credit 
card payments, that were available up to the end of No -
vember 2022. Until recently, the GDP growth rate for the 
past 13 weeks implied by the WAI was distinctly in negative 
territory. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022c).Deutsche Bundesbank

the expectations surveyed by the Association of 
German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, 
which cover a slightly longer period of time. 
Overall, economic output is likely to continue 
to decline somewhat in the first quarter of 
2023 and marginally in the second quarter.
The expected decline in economic activity will 
be broadly based and the result of multiple fac -
tors. Households will be confronted with a de -
cline in the purchasing power of their incomes 
due to high inflation and will therefore reduce 
their consumption expenditure. This will affect 
retailers and other consumption- related service 
providers. Furthermore, as in many other sec -
tors, these will themselves be burdened by the 
high costs of energy. Energy- intensive industry 
has already sharply cut back production and is 
likely to scale it back even further at first. On 
the whole, however, industry is likely to remain 
fairly unscathed through the winter. Although 
new orders have fallen sharply since the begin -
ning of the year, order books are still well filled. 
In addition, some industrial sectors will benefit 
from easing tensions in global supply chains. 
This could mitigate the downward pressure on 
exports stemming from the reduced competi -
tiveness and weakening foreign demand 
caused by high energy costs. Investment will 
also be dampened by elevated uncertainty and 
higher financing costs. The downturn in the 
construction sector will continue. Lastly, the 
end of coronavirus pandemic- related expend -
iture on vaccination and testing will lead to a 
distinct drop in government consumption.
The German economy is expected to gradually 
recover from the second half of 2023. Slightly 
before that time, exporters will receive their 
first boost to growth from foreign demand, 
which is assumed to rise (see pp. 22 f. for more 
information on the assumptions). This will also 
drive business investment, especially as uncer -
tainty starts to abate. As a result of progress 
made in diversifying the energy supply, energy 
commodity price pressures will gradually dimin -
ish. As the labour market will remain robust 
and nominal wages will rise sharply, real wages will also rise again from the second half of 
2023 as inflation rates fall. Consequently, 
households’ real disposable income and con -
sumption expenditure will also increase once 
again. The decline in housing investment is 
likely to continue for the longest time.
Overall, the German economy will contract by 
0.5% in calendar- adjusted terms next year, 
after expanding by 1.8% this year. It will then 
grow by 1.7% in 2024 and by 1.4% in 2025. 
This means that, compared with the June pro -
jection, the expected growth rate for 2022 has 
been revised slightly downwards, the rate for 
2023 has been revised significantly down -Multiple factors

wards, and the rate for 2024 has likewise been 
revised slightly downwards. The decisive factor 
for these downward revisions is primarily the 
massive deterioration in supply conditions, par -
ticularly with regard to the energy supply, fol -
lowing the Russian war of aggression against 
Ukraine. However, weaker growth in foreign 
demand and higher financing costs also play a 
role.
At present, the German economy is operating 
considerably below its medium- term perform -
ance potential. Macroeconomic production 
capacity will not return to more or less normal 
levels of utilisation until 2025. Until that time, 
however, the output gap will not be due to any 
lack of demand, but will instead be primarily 
the result of supply disruptions, especially with 
regard to energy. To a certain extent, these dis -
ruptions may be considered temporary.6 Never -
theless, it cannot be assumed that, in the long 
term, the costs of energy supply in Germany 
will return to their levels from before the cur -
rent energy crisis. This will lead to losses in 
value added. For this reason, the estimate of 
the German economy’s potential output was 
downgraded steeply (see the box on pp. 29 f.). 
The growth rate of potential output is now 
estimated at +0.8% for the current year, +0.6% 
for 2023, +0.4% for 2024, and +0.7% for 2025.
Economic activity in detail
Private consumption has risen sharply over the 
course of the year so far, despite the extraor -
dinary uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine 
and the high rates of inflation. This is chiefly 
due to catch-  up effects following the rollback 
of virtually all coronavirus pandemic contain -
ment measures in the spring. These upward 
forces continued to dominate in the third quar -Economy will

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. These were 
made on the basis of information available 
as at 23 November 2022. The assumptions 
regarding economic activity in the euro area 
are derived from projections from the na-
tional central banks of the euro area coun-
tries.1 These projections incorporate those 
fi  scal policy measures that have been either 
adopted or adequately specifi  ed and are 
deemed likely to be implemented.
With regard to the war in Ukraine and its 
ramifi  cations, it is assumed that the confl  ict 
will gradually abate, but that sanctions will 
remain in force. This projection likewise pre-
supposes that it is possible to avoid a situ-
ation in which a shortage of gas in the euro 
area would lead to rationing. In addition, it 
expects that more and more bottlenecks in 
the supply of intermediate inputs will be re-
solved.
Weakening global economic growth 
amid gradual easing of high price 
pressures 
High infl  ation in many countries is weighing 
on global consumption. The considerable 
rise in energy prices and uncertainty about 
future energy supply are also taking their 
toll on business activities, especially in Eur-
ope. In China, strict restrictions imposed to 
combat the COVID- 19 pandemic and tur-
moil in the real estate market are dampen-
ing demand. At the same time, the progres-
sive tightening of monetary policy in many 
countries is having a negative impact on 
economic activity, too.
In the summer half- year (April- September) 
of 2022, the global economy expanded at a somewhat weaker pace than expected in 
the June projection. However, given the 
negative factors, the outlook for the current 
winter half- year (October 2022-March 
2023) has deteriorated. Global economic 
growth in the next two years is now also 
expected to be lower than previously esti-
mated.
Growth in the global economy excluding 
the euro area looks set to slow to 2½% in 
2023, after rising by 3¼% in 2022. It is then 
expected to return to somewhat higher 
rates of 3% and 3¼% in 2024 and 2025. At 
5½% this year, the uptick in international 
trade (excluding the euro area) is higher 
than the rise in global gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) and what had been projected in 
the June outlook. The projected growth 
rates of 2% in 2023 and 3¼% in 2024, 
however, will subsequently lag behind June 
expectations. A rise of 3¼% is anticipated 
for 2025.
Effects of Ukraine war weighing on 
economic  activity in euro area; high 
inﬂ  ation  rates eroding purchasing 
power
Economic recovery in the euro area in the 
summer half- year was much better than ex-
pected, driven especially by the recovery in 
the services sector following the end of 
pandemic- related restrictions. However, the 
impact of burdens associated with the 
Ukraine war is likely to be stronger than ex-
pected in June – and this is set to continue 
well into next year. The deterioration in 
global economic activity is also holding 
back developments in exporters’ sales mar-

of the euro area countries were completed on 30 No-
vember 2022.Deutsche Bundesbank

kets. In addition, with monetary policy nor-
malisation now under way, the cost of 
credit- fi  nanced expenditure has risen. Over-
all, this will slightly depress economic activ-
ity in the winter half- year. The economy will 
be able to expand at a stronger pace again 
– towards the latter part of the projection 
horizon – only once uncertainty decreases, 
infl  ation rates go down, more supply bottle-
necks are resolved and foreign demand re-
bounds. This year, a growth rate of 4.1% is 
expected for the euro area (excluding Ger-
many). Next year, at an average rate of 
0.8%, economic activity will expand at a 
much weaker pace than had been assumed 
in the June outlook. At 2.0%, the rate pro-
jected for 2024 will then be somewhat 
lower still. A rate of 1.9% is anticipated for 
2025.
German exporters’ sales markets are likely 
to see somewhat slower growth than world trade over the projection horizon. This is 
because the EU economies that have close 
ties with Germany are being more adversely 
affected by the Ukraine war and the energy 
crisis.
Technical assumptions of the projection
Following completion of the June projec-
tion, energy commodity prices initially rose 
further. With Russia fi  rst sharply cutting 
back its supply of natural gas to Europe 
through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and 
then terminating it altogether at the begin-
ning of September, European gas prices ac-
celerated to new highs in this period. 
Thanks to other gas- producing countries 
expanding their supply, increased imports 
of liquefi  ed natural gas (LNG), successful 
energy- saving efforts and the mild weather 
conditions, the EU’s natural gas reservoirs 
are now just about replenished. Against this 
background, the European prices for gas 
and – due to their close relationship – elec-
tricity fell quite signifi  cantly in the months 
leading up to the projection cut- off date. In 
the meantime, both prices have already 
picked up again, and futures prices indicate 
that this trend will continue in the winter 
months. Market quotations suggest that 
the decline in prices for crude oil observed 
since the summer will continue in the com-
ing year. Electricity and gas prices are also 
expected to fall in 2024 and 2025 but will 
remain signifi  cantly higher than the prices 
projected in June.2 Given the gloomier 
global economic outlook, other commodity 
prices are expected to decline steeply on 
average in the coming year and to rise only 
marginally in the two years thereafter.
Agricultural producer prices in the euro area 
temporarily slipped slightly from the peak 
reached in the summer months – probably

partly due to the resumption of grain ex-
ports from Ukrainian ports. However, they 
have risen again in recent months. The as-
sumptions derived from futures quotations 
suggest that producer prices for food will 
remain high. In 2024 and 2025, they are set 
to weaken slightly, but will remain, on the 
whole, well above the June projection.
The Eurosystem discontinued its net asset 
purchases under the asset purchase pro-
gramme (APP) as of 1 July 2022. Given the 
considerable rise in infl  ation, the prospect 
of the infl  ation rate remaining above the 
2% target for an extended period of time 
and further upside risks, the ECB Governing 
Council decided to raise its key interest 
rates – by 50 basis points in July, 75 basis 
points in September and a further 75 basis 
points at its October meeting. The Govern-
ing Council expects policy rates to continue 
to increase. In the money market, interest 
rates have gone up signifi  cantly in recent 
months. In addition, EURIBOR futures are 
on a far steeper upward trajectory into the 
coming year than had been assumed in the 
June outlook. Against this backdrop, yields 
on ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) also 
went up signifi  cantly. The yield trajectory 
derived from futures prices will remain more 
or less constant over the projection horizon 
– similar to what was assumed in the June 
outlook, but at a much higher level. Dis-
tinctly higher fi  nancing costs are also ex-
pected for bank loans.
The tightening of monetary policy in the 
United States, which foreign exchange mar-
kets perceive to be stronger than in the 
euro area, caused the euro to depreciate 
further after the June projection was com-
pleted. In the period underlying the ex-
change rate assumptions, the euro was 
trading at US$1.03, 2% lower than as-
sumed in the June projection. However, in-
creases in value against the pound sterling, 
yen and renminbi contributed to a 1¼% ap-preciation of the euro against 42 currencies 
of major trading partners.
Fiscal policy shaped by energy crisis and 
high inﬂ  ation
Temporary, crisis- related fi  scal measures 
have a major impact on the outlook for 
public fi  nances. This year, they will push up 
the government defi  cit by around 3% of 
GDP (see the chart on p. 24).3 Coronavirus- 
related measures are still exerting pressure 
on the government budget, albeit to a 
lesser extent than in 2021. Transfers to en-
terprises and healthcare expenditure consti-
tute the main strains. In addition, there are 
extensive new support measures in re-
sponse to the energy crisis and high infl  a-
tion. Payments to gas trading companies

(especially Uniper) and lump- sum transfers 
to households are particularly weighty in 
fi  nancial terms.
The coronavirus measures will largely expire 
in 2023. By contrast, new crisis assistance 
measures are increasing sharply. At around 
2% of GDP , transfers to households and en-
terprises under the electricity and gas price 
brake are the largest of these measures. In 
addition, special assistance is being pro-
vided to enterprises that are severely af-
fected by the energy crisis, in particular 
government capital injections to offset 
losses (capital transfers) and cost subsidies. 
Further measures have been implemented. 
For instance, employers’ one- off payments 
of up to €3,000 are exempt from income 
tax and social contributions until the end of 
2024. In addition, VAT on natural gas and 
district heating is being charged at a re-
duced rate up to the end of the fi  rst quarter 
of 2024.In 2024, transfers under the electricity and 
gas price brake will fall signifi  cantly in an-
nual terms. This is because, in the projec-
tion, they will expire at the end of April 
2024. In addition, in 2024, the government 
budget is not to supply any of the funding 
for the electricity price brake. This measure 
is to be fi  nanced instead from profi  ts made 
on the electricity market between Decem-
ber 2022 and June 2023. Furthermore, the 
government will no longer be effecting any 
capital transfers to gas trading companies 
in 2024.
The projection also includes fi  scal policy 
measures that will affect the government 
budget in the longer term. On the revenue 
side, income tax cuts are beginning to take 
effect. In particular, the tax scale is being 
shifted in order to compensate for bracket 
creep. The projection assumes that legisla-
tion will be passed in order to continue this 
practice in 2025. In addition, revenue from 
the EU programme NextGenerationEU 
(NGEU) will decrease next year.4 By con-
trast, contribution rates for the social secur-
ity funds will be raised by just over 1 per-
centage point for 2023 and 2024 together. 
Health insurance scheme rates, in particular, 
will increase signifi  cantly. This will close the 
structural fi  nancing gap that is largely still 
being plugged by central government this 
year. On the expenditure side, investment in 
military machinery and equipment and 
spending on climate change mitigation are 
set to increase sharply based on projects 
under the Federal Armed Forces Special 
Fund and the Climate and Transformation 
Fund. Pension expenditure will be marked 
by the fact that pensions for persons with 
reduced earnings capacity will be extended 
from 2024 onwards.
4 In Germany, NGEU is primarily used to fi  nance exist-
ing programmes, thus reducing the general govern-
ment defi  cit resulting from this programme.Temporary fiscal measures affecting

ter, but are now likely to have run their course. 
In the current winter half- year, households are 
likely to considerably reduce their consumption 
expenditure due to the high rates of inflation 
and the resulting decline in real disposable in -
come. This will apply to more than just the 
consumption of electricity and heating energy. 
For instance, price- adjusted sales in retail trade 
and the accommodation and food service ac -
tivities sector have been declining for several 
months now. Moreover, consumer sentiment is 
highly pessimistic. This likewise holds true for 
the business expectations among consumption- 
related service providers, such as retail trade 
and accommodation and food service activ -
ities, as surveyed by the ifo Institute. While the 
measures implemented by the Federal Govern -
ment will mitigate the cost burden on con -
sumers, they will not compensate for the losses 
in purchasing power. Some households will use 
some of their savings to smooth their con -
sumption. However, given the expectation of 
rising energy costs and the uncertainty regard -
ing the exact amounts of future energy bills, it 
is likely they will put money aside for future ex -
penditure at the same time. On balance, the 
saving ratio will therefore fall only slightly in the 
current winter half- year.
Real disposable incomes will increase again 
from the middle of next year as inflation eases 
and real wages subsequently rise as well. Con -
sumers will then spend more on goods and ser -
vices again. In addition, the saving ratio will ini -
tially decline somewhat more once uncertainty 
goes down and the reserves built up in the 
winter are used for energy back- payments. 
Some of the savings accumulated during the 
pandemic- related restrictions on consumption 
will be unwound. The saving ratio will there -
fore remain below the pre- pandemic level for a 
number of quarters. This will stabilise con -
sumption. Overall, private consumption will 
grow markedly in 2024 and 2025 and the sav -
ing ratio will largely normalise by the end of the 
projection horizon.7Exports are expected to fall below the level of 
the third quarter in the current winter half- year.

pectations and new orders from abroad, which 
have been trending downward for some time. 
Although the order books – which are still well 
filled due to the shortage of intermediate 
goods – are a buffer against the weakening of 
demand, the export- oriented industry is suffer -
ing as a result of the high energy prices. The 
comparatively sharp rise in labour costs is pla -
cing an additional burden on price competitive -
ness. However, exports are likely to pick up 
again from the second quarter of 2023. The 
headwinds caused by energy prices and supply 
chain pressures should then gradually diminish 
and demand for goods manufactured in Ger -
many should rise again significantly. The accu -mulated order backlog is likely to temporarily 
provide a perceptible additional boost. Exports 
will, however, lose some momentum again to -
wards the end of the projection horizon.
The burdens on the export sector will also af -
fect business investment. In particular, firms are 
likely to postpone or completely scrap invest -
ment projects given the high degree of uncer -
tainty regarding the energy supply and its costs. 
Increased financing costs will represent an add -
itional burden. Against this backdrop, business 
investment is likely to decline markedly in the 
current winter half- year. As uncertainty grad -
ually eases and foreign demand rises, invest -
ment is expected to rebound from the second 
quarter of 2023, however. Investment in ve -
hicles, in particular, could temporarily stimulate 
catch- up effects if supply bottlenecks are re -
solved. The requirements for Germany’s transi -
tion to a low- carbon economy are likely to sup -
port investment. This could be intensified fur -
ther by the high energy costs.
Housing investment declined sharply in the 
summer half- year of 2022, much more strongly 
than expected in the June projection. The 
downturn is likely to continue well into the 
coming year, with several factors playing a role 
here. Alongside the sharp rise in construction 
costs that has persisted for some time now, the 
financing costs of housing loans, in particular, 
have climbed significantly of late. This has 
made credit- financed housing less affordable. 
Added to this are heightened uncertainty, par -
ticularly regarding income developments, and 
the limited scope for financing due to high in -
flation. This is likely to dampen demand for 
housing markedly. In line with this, the number 
of building permits has fallen sharply since the 
beginning of the year and new orders for resi -
dential housing projects have seen a sharp de -
cline recently. In addition, construction com -
panies are reporting a rising number of order 
cancellations, according to the ifo Institute. 
However, the fundamental conditions for hous -
ing construction remain favourable. There is a

could increase even further as a result of the 
high level of migration. Furthermore, the hous -
ing stock needs to be adjusted to the changed 
conditions, especially with regard to heating. 
Consistent with the robust labour market and 
the renewed rise in real income, housing in -
vestment is therefore likely to veer back onto 
an expansionary path towards the end of next 
year. Growth will be relatively moderate, 
though.
Very strong rates of increase in housing prices 
continued until mid- 2022. Amid the sharp rise 
in financing costs, house price growth subse -
quently ground to a virtual halt. Depressed 
housing demand is likely to cause prices to ini -
tially continue to stagnate. But, a tighter supply 
–  as is anticipated  – and the extremely high 
and ever rising construction costs will gradually 
drive prices back up. The generally intact de -
mand for housing will also contribute to this. 
Overall, house prices will rise again during the 
course of 2023 and over the remainder of the 
projection horizon, albeit at a much slower 
pace than before.
Government demand will significantly dampen 
economic activity next year. This is because 
pandemic- related healthcare spending is likely 
to largely tail off, which, taken in isolation, will 
reduce government consumption considerably. 
Higher government investment spending, par -
ticularly on military equipment, will not offset 
this. Real government demand will pick up 
again from 2024 and grow somewhat more 
strongly than real GDP .
Imports will rise considerably during the projec -
tion period. They are likely to initially decline in 
the current winter half- year. However, as ex -
ports and business investment rise from the 
second quarter onwards, imports will also re -
bound. High demand for imported intermedi -
ate inputs will arise via these two channels, in 
particular. This demand will be further strength -
ened by the uptick in private consumption that 
will take place later next year. Imports will then 
expand quite sharply in line with aggregate de -Temporary halt

mand over the remainder of the projection 
horizon.
Germany’s current account surplus will fall 
sharply this year. On an average for 2022, it 
could stand at just under 3½% of GDP , follow -
ing as much as 7½% in 2021. The key factor is 
the considerable decline in the trade balance. 
This is reflected in the terms of trade, which 
hugely deteriorated as a result of the sharp in -
crease in the prices of energy and other im -
ported commodities. With regard to real trade 
flows, imports will also grow much more 
strongly than exports. The higher demand for 
imported goods and services this year is being 
supported, in particular, by private consump -
tion, partly because of the normalisation in 
travel activity. The terms of trade will drop 
again significantly on average next year. They 
will only recover to some extent thereafter. The 
assumed decline in commodity prices and 
strong domestic inflation, which also affects 
export prices, will come into play here. All in 
all, the trade balance will continue to decline 
next year before subsequently rising some -
what. As a result, the current account surplus 
will fall to 2½% of GDP in 2023 and will rise 
again slightly in 2024. It could stand at around 
3% of GDP in 2025.
Labour market
The previously favourable labour market devel -
opments have given way to a sideways move -
ment in recent months. Employment barely 
rose from an already very high level in the third 
quarter. Unemployment increased only margin -
ally from its low level – if the effect of record -
ing Ukrainian refugees is disregarded.8 A small 
proportion of the Ukrainian population in Ger -
many were already able to take on jobs subject 
to social security contributions. Short- time 
work played only a minor role in the third quar -
ter. Working hours per employee remained 
broadly stable at a comparatively low level.The general statutory minimum wage, which 
has been raised sharply in two stages over the 
past few months, probably had minimal impact 
on employment and unemployment in the 
short term. Given the persistently high labour 
shortages – which extend to some unskilled la -
bour segments – the minimum wage increases 
are likely to have had comparatively little im -
pact on labour demand. This may also have 
been due to the fact that enterprises are likely 
to be able to push through price increases 
more easily in the current environment than in 
previous years.9
The high demand for labour compared with 
the labour supply suggests that the labour mar -
ket will largely withstand the economic head -
winds in the next few quarters. Enterprises’ 
employment plans have weakened in recent 
months, but remain slightly positive. Although 
the number of job vacancies and the time 
taken to fill vacant positions have declined 
somewhat recently, they are still very high by 
historical standards. The high demand for la -
bour is likely to decline somewhat in the cur -
rent winter half-year. As a result, the hitherto 
tight labour market would ease to some ex -
tent. However, there are no signs of a major 
employment adjustment. For people who lose 
their jobs, the prospects of finding a new job 
are very good. In this respect, unemployment is 
also likely to rise only to a relatively minor ex -
tent. This is mainly due to increased frictional 
unemployment.
As the economic recovery begins in the second 
half of 2023, employment and the number of 
hours worked will also increase again, albeit at Current account 
balance will 
temporarily dip 
well below 3%

9 For example, Bobeica et al. (2019) find that the relation -
ship between wages and prices is narrower in times of high 
inflation, on the one hand, yet also more responsive to de -
mand shocks than to supply shocks, on the other. As a re -
sult of the easing of measures to contain the coronavirus 
pandemic, demand is likely to have picked up in the ser -
vices sector in particular, which is especially affected by the 
increase in the minimum wage.Deutsche Bundesbank

Impact of permanently higher energy costs on German 
potential output
The decline in natural gas deliveries from 
Russia and heightened uncertainty about 
energy supply caused energy prices in Ger-
many to rise sharply this year. Energy prices 
in Germany are likely to be higher than be-
fore the current crisis over the long term as 
well. This is due, among other things, to the 
higher transport and production costs asso-
ciated with the substitution of Russian nat-
ural gas by liquefi  ed natural gas (LNG).1 
Over the projection horizon, energy prices 
are likely to more than double compared 
with 2019 and to remain elevated.2
A production function approach can be 
used to determine the supply- side effects of 
permanent energy price hikes.3 The aggre-
gate production function is expanded to 
take into account energy consumption as a 
further factor of production alongside la-
bour and capital. In this model framework, high energy prices mean that enterprises 
tend to reduce their energy use and – in the 
case of imperfect substitutes – their produc-
tion. The calculations focus on the energy- 
intensive sectors industry and transport. By 
assumption, output in the rest of the enter-
prise sector is not directly affected in the 
calculations by high energy prices, yet spill-
over effects emanating from industry and 
transport have a supply- dampening impact 
in the model framework.
The scale of output losses depends on the 
extent to which production declines when 
energy prices rise. This energy price elasti-
city of output can be derived by assuming a 
production structure with energy as an 
input factor.4 According to the model re-
sults, the projected sustained rise in energy 
prices dampens gross value added by 
around 4½% in industry and 3½% in trans-
port. In addition, there is evidence of direct 
spillover effects from industry to the trans-
port sector and the rest of the enterprise 
sector.5 Overall, direct energy price and in-
direct spillover effects give rise to a negative 
supply effect of around 2% of gross value 
added.1 See German Council of Economic Experts (2022).
2 Energy price developments are modelled here on the 
energy imports defl  ator, which is largely dependent on 
the commodity prices for oil and gas assumed in the 
projection. A comparison with 2019 is more meaning-
ful as energy prices fell briefl  y in 2020 as a result of the 
pandemic.
3 See Knetsch and Molzahn (2012). In the second 
step, the identifi  ed energy price effects are incorpor-
ated into the Bundesbank’s estimate of potential out-
put, which is based on a medium- term oriented pro-
duction function with capital and labour as inputs as 
well as total factor productivity (see Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2007, 2012)).
4 See Knetsch and Molzahn (2012). According to the 
model results, the energy price elasticity of output de-
pends on the (econometrically estimated) elasticity of 
substitution between energy and capital, the share of 
energy costs in production and the initial price of en-
ergy. The elasticity of substitution was estimated as a 
regression parameter using the ordinary least squares 
(OLS) method based on the energy demand function 
from the production model.
5 They are based on cumulative impulse- response 
functions from vector autoregressions for the value 
added of industry, the transport sector and the rest of 
the enterprise sector. These spillover effects can arise, 
for example, through the interconnectedness of the 
economic sectors’ value chains.Direct and indirect supply effects

These results are subject to high uncer-
tainty, the estimation uncertainty surround-
ing the model parameters playing a role 
here. Moreover, the results are heavily de-
pendent on the assumption that energy 
price increases are permanent. They are 
therefore prone to revision with regard to 
possible future changes in energy supply 
and policy that impact energy prices, for ex-
ample.
In this projection, potential output will be 
around 1¾% lower in 2025 than reported 
in the June projection.6 In addition to the 
identifi  ed energy price effects, there is also 
still the remaining impact, with a smaller 
contribution, of Russia’s ongoing war 
against Ukraine. The downward revision is 
based in roughly equal measure on the con-
tributions made by total factor productivity 
(TFP) and the capital stock. In particular, the 
higher cost of energy inputs will signifi  -
cantly weaken trend TFP . Disruptions to supply chains and the use of less tailored in-
puts in order to save costs are also likely to 
be refl  ected in the depressed trend TFP . Fur-
thermore, parts of the capital stock will be 
rendered obsolete if energy- intensive in-
vestments are no longer profi  table due to 
high energy costs. From today’s perspec-
tive, the potential labour supply is barely af-
fected by the rise in energy costs. It will 
benefi  t from the high infl  ux of refugees 
from Ukraine in 2022 and 2023, however.Potential output compared to the

6 Overall, the impact of the Ukraine war could cut Ger-
man potential output by 2¼% up to 2025 – if it is also 
taken into account that potential output was already 
revised downwards in the June projection. This assess-
ment is based on a comparison of the current estimate 
of potential output with that in the December 2021 
forecast.Deutsche Bundesbank

a comparatively moderate pace. On an annual 
average, the improvement will be particularly 
evident in 2024. Employment with full social 
security coverage will gain greatly in import -
ance here – as in previous years. By contrast, 
the number of self- employed persons and per -
sons exclusively in low- paid part- time employ -
ment will continue to go down. Labour short -
ages will gradually intensify again.
The current high degree of labour market tight -
ness is primarily a consequence of demographic 
shifts in the German population. Labour- related 
immigration will help to reduce this tension. In 
2022 to date, immigration to Germany has 
been very high, mainly on account of refugees, 
especially from Ukraine. For the period from 
February to August alone, data from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office show that 874,000 people 
migrated from Ukraine in net terms. This figure 
is higher than that expected for 2022 as a 
whole in the June projection. However, as refu -
gees from Ukraine are disproportionately 
women with children, many of these people 
are unavailable to the labour market, or are 
only available to a limited extent or not avail -
able immediately (due to integration measures, 
for example). This projection reckons with a net 
total of 1.3 million immigrants to Germany this 
year. Net immigration of 350,000 is assumed 
for 2023 and of 300,000 per year from 2024. 
Despite new immigrants’ relatively low labour 
force participation for the time being, the la -
bour force is growing more strongly in absolute 
terms than assumed in the previous projection. 
However, medium- term immigration is not 
high enough to prevent the demographic de -
cline in the labour supply, even over the longer 
term.
Based on these assumptions, the labour force 
will decline from 2025 – one year later than ex -
pected in the June projection. Meanwhile, em -
ployment will continue to rise slightly due to 
underemployment falling. Amid rising demand 
for labour, the volume of work will also in -
crease in the medium term as the result of an 
increase in the number of hours worked per employee. This is corroborated, in particular, by 
the fairly low number of hours worked by part- 
time employees by international standards. Un -
employment will fall nearly all the way back to 
its pre- pandemic level over the projection hori -
zon.
Labour costs and prices
Since the second quarter of 2022, wage agree -
ments have been markedly higher than in pre -
vious years. Trade unions in the chemical and

annualised terms. The high inflation played an 
important role in the pay negotiations and is 
also likely to be a major factor in upcoming 
wage negotiations. This is already reflected in 
the current, exceptionally high wage demands 
being posed by trade unions.
The most recent wage agreements are charac -
terised by the fact that the rise in earnings is 
only partly based on permanent increases in 
scheduled rates of pay. In addition, tax- free 
and social contribution- exempt “inflation com -
pensation bonuses” are being paid out. This 
will remain possible up to the end of 2024 as a 
measure to mitigate the high inflation.10 This wage component structure is likely to serve as 
a template for upcoming wage negotiations in 
many sectors.
The major pay round in 2023 for approximately 
10 million employed persons will likely remain 
caught between opposing forces: high inflation 
and labour market tightness, on the one hand, 
and depressed economic activity and uncer -
tainty, on the other. Wage increases will prob -
ably be strong but insufficient to fully compen -
sate for high inflation. This, coupled with the 
low wage settlements of the pandemic- shaped 
years of 2020 and 2021, will create a certain 
pressure to attain higher wage settlements in 
future. Together with the improved economic 
situation and the further increase in labour 
market tightness, pent- up wage demands in 
2024 and 2025 will contribute to further sharp 
increases in negotiated rates of pay. Against 
this backdrop, in 2025 it will be possible to 
compensate in part for the inflation compensa -
tion bonuses that will have expired at the end 
of 2024. Nevertheless, the increase in negoti -
ated rates of pay will then be a great deal lower 
once more, albeit still higher than during the 
pre- pandemic economic boom.11
Actual earnings are rising considerably more 
steeply than negotiated wages this year. The 
main reasons for this are the decline in short-  
time work and the increase in working hours.

2022 will trigger a robust boost to wages, 
though this will not fully come to bear until 
2023.12 Added to this is the fact that, following 
a cyclical setback next year, the number of 
hours worked will climb significantly once more 
in the years thereafter. Furthermore, more paid 
overtime will accrue as a result of increasing la -
bour market tightness. Wage drift is therefore 
set to be firmly in positive territory for the dur -
ation of the projection horizon. Actual wages 
will rise by around 5% in both 2023 and 2024 
accordingly. These are the highest rates since 
German reunification. In 2025, wage growth 
could then fall considerably but remain very 
strong at slightly over 4%.
Compensation per employee will rise at simi -
larly high rates as actual earnings over the pro -
jection horizon. In combination with declining 
economic activity and stable employment, this 
means a strong boost for unit labour costs next 
year. Labour productivity will increase further in 
2024, with the result that unit labour costs will 
still rise steeply, but with decreasing momen -
tum. This trend is set to continue in 2025. The 
price pressure exerted by wage costs will there -
fore be consistently high over the projection 
horizon. Domestic inflation as measured by the 
GDP deflator is set to reach a rate of just over 
5% in the current year. It will stand at a similar 
level next year, putting it well below the rise in 
unit labour costs, however. This is because 
profit margins and government subsidies will 
partly cushion the cost surge. Over the remain -
der of the projection horizon, the GDP deflator 
rate will remain high overall, though it will 
gradually decline somewhat.
At the consumer level, the underlying trend for 
price inflation in the summer half- year re -
mained extremely strong, although measures 
to ease the rise in energy prices came into 
force. The inflation rate as measured by the 
HICP reached a new high of 8.7% in May, but 
then declined slightly with the introduction of 
the €9 public transport ticket and the fuel re -
bate in June. Both measures were in place until 
the end of August, and, in addition, the levy imposed by the German Renewable Energy Act 
(Erneuerbare- Energien- Gesetz  – EEG) was abol -
ished in July. Nevertheless, the inflation rate in 
August was even slightly above its previous 
peak in May. With the €9 public transport ticket 
and the fuel rebate coming to an end in Sep -
tember, inflation entered double- digit territory 
for the first time in more than 70 years, ex -
panding further to 11.3% by November. Back 
at the time of the June projection, by contrast, 
a rate of 7% had been expected for November. 
Price inflation was higher than expected across 
the board.
Energy inflation rose surprisingly strongly, des -
pite the fact that relief in the form of the fuel 
rebate and the EEG levy was passed through to 
consumers more or less in full, as expected. 
This is probably also true of the recent reduc -
tion in the VAT rate on gas and district heating 
from 19% to 7%, which has been in force since 
October. However, consumer rates for electri -
city and gas were raised much more strongly 
than expected. This was presumably partly due 
to purchase prices having risen significantly 
more steeply than anticipated in the meantime. 
Another factor here is that higher supplier costs 
were probably passed on to a greater extent 
and/ or more rapidly than was usual in the past. 
Furthermore, the prices of heating oil and die -
sel rose sharply despite the decline in the price 
of crude oil.13
Although European agricultural producer prices 
roughly matched expectations in the fourth 
quarter, consumer food prices were also well 
above the June projection. Cost increases in 
production and transport as well as the pro -Unit labour

12 The higher minimum wage is expected to push up ac -

Deutsche Bundesbank (2022f). The general statutory min -
imum wage had already been raised on 1 January 2022 
and 1 July 2022. In macroeconomic terms, these rises had 
a stronger impact on actual wages than on negotiated 
wages, even if the latter are being strongly affected in 
some low- wage sectors, such as accommodation and food 
service ac tivities.
13 This was due to a supply shortage caused by several 
factors, including a decline in imports from Russia and re -
duced refining capacity. For more information, see Inter -
national Energy Agency (2022a).Deutsche Bundesbank

tracted drought are likely to have contributed 
to this.14 Core inflation (the headline inflation 
rate excluding energy and food) rose surpris -
ingly steeply, too. The fact that the euro depre -
ciated unexpectedly against the US dollar and 
that price pressures were higher at the earlier 
input stages probably also caused the prices of 
industrial goods excluding energy to climb 
more substantially. Services inflation slightly ex -
ceeded the level anticipated in the projection 
as well. A stronger than expected widening of 
profit margins is likely to have played a role in 
this, particularly in sectors that were previously 
heavily affected by pandemic containment 
measures.
The inflation rate is likely to remain very high 
for the time being. The government’s assump -
tion of the advance payment for gas, which is 
envisaged in the Act on Emergency Aid for 
Natural  Gas Heating for End Consumers ( Erd-
gas- Wärme-  Soforthilfegesetz ), will probably 
markedly dampen the HICP in December. The HICP rate could then temporarily fall below 
10%. However, it is likely to return in January 
2023 to a double- digit figure similar to that of 
November 2022. This is because consumer 
prices for electricity and gas are rising sharply – 
according to the reference dataset used, they 
are, on average, still currently below the level 
that the electricity and gas price brake will 
reach by then.15 Non- subsidised consumption

14 Although the prolonged drought is also likely to have 
contributed to the rise in agricultural producer prices, this is 
difficult to substantiate, as relevant assumptions about 
agricultural producer prices are not available for all of the 
food products recorded in the HICP – for fruit and vege -
tables, for instance. However, these products were prob -
ably hit particularly hard by the drought.

mined on the basis of the average prices for electricity and 
natural gas as calculated by the Federal Statistical Office for 
households in the first half of 2022. See Federal Statistical 
Office (2022). Here, the prices for the first half of the year 
are extrapolated using the Bundesbank’s projection for the

heightened cost pressure from energy will in -

However, after the beginning of 2023, the in -

HICP16 The subsidisation of energy prices in the context of the 
electricity and gas price brake will only begin in March for 
the lion’s share of consumption, but will also be paid out 
retroactively for January and February. This means that the 
price brake will probably already have a dampening effect 
on the HICP at the beginning of the year. However, it will 
only mitigate the underlying rise in electricity and gas prices.
17 Consumers pay, at maximum, the respective highest 
price for a specified basic consumption, which is depend -
ent on the consumption of the previous year (40 cent per 
kWh for electricity and 12 cent per kWh for gas). The re -
maining difference from the non- subsidised price is 
credited to them in the form of government transfers via 
suppliers – irrespective of whether they have actually met 
the basic consumption level. In this respect, no price cap 
has been set from an economic point of view.Deutsche Bundesbank

ition, it is assumed that the oil price will de -
cline, and the base effect of the sharp rise in 
energy prices in March 2022 will stop impact -
ing on inflation. Furthermore, the introduction 
of the €49 “Deutschland-  Ticket” public trans -
port ticket, taken in isolation, is likely to have a 
dampening effect from the spring onwards. 
The core rate, by contrast, will remain high. It 
could rise to just over 4% next year and thus be 
slightly higher than in the current year. Overall, 
the inflation rate will fall to around 7% on an 
annual average in 2023, starting out at just 
over 8½% this year. The various government 
measures to cushion the rise in energy prices 
are estimated to reduce the rates considerably 
in 2022 and even more so in 2023 (see the 
table on p. 35).
The gradual easing of consumer prices is ex -
pected to continue into 2024 and 2025. How -
ever, price inflation will remain high. The pro -
jected inflation rate will fall to just over 4% in 
2024, but will still stand at around 2¾% in 
2025. The core rate is set to decrease to ap -
proximately 3% in 2024 and 2½% in 2025.
There are various factors behind this expect -
ation. For one thing, energy and food com -
modity prices are assumed to be falling. Al -
though energy price inflation will likely decline 
distinctly on account of this, it will remain sub -
stantial. As electricity and gas suppliers some -
times buy energy on the stock exchanges far in 
advance, consumer prices will initially still have 
to be adjusted to previously increased market 
prices. Because of this, consumer prices will 
also not fall as sharply later, as the assumed de -
cline in commodity prices might suggest. In 
addition, the cost increases will be passed 
through to many tenants only with a significant 
delay in any case, as the settlement payments 
are based on the previous heating period. For 
this reason, the levels of the end consumer 
rates, which will be decisive after the electricity 
and gas price brake expires in May 2024, are 
still likely to considerably surpass the limits of 
the price brake. This will then trigger strong re -bound effects in electricity and gas prices (see 
the table on p. 35).
Further upward pressure on prices will come 
from the surge in wage costs, which will only 
ease off slightly in 2025. This is a major reason 
why inflation excluding energy will be markedly 
above its longer- term average in 2024 and 
2025. In addition, the sharp rise in import 
prices will also drive prices over a prolonged 
period. However, price pressures will gradually 
diminish on this front, too, in part due to the 
subsiding of strains in global supply chains over 
the projection horizon. Lastly, Germany’s transi -
tion to a low- carbon economy will create add -
itional cost pressures.
Public finances
According to this projection, the general gov -
ernment deficit ratio stands at 2¾% for 2022. 
This is a significant year- on- year decrease 
(2021: 3.7%). The economic recovery and the 
high inflation are providing budgetary relief, 
with inflation initially causing revenue to rise 
considerably faster than expenditure after fac -
toring out new fiscal measures. Moreover, 
profit- related taxes are recording strong 
growth. This growth is significantly stronger 
than would have been expected on the basis of 
nominal macroeconomic variables and changes 
in tax law. There is barely any change in the 
volume of temporary support measures com -
pared with 2021: pandemic- related budget 
burdens are decreasing, while financial assis -
tance in response to the energy crisis is now 
being provided (for more on fiscal policy meas -
ures, see pp. 23 f.).
The deficit ratio will rise considerably in 2023, 
to 4%. The deficit will grow in size for a num -
ber of reasons. The volume of temporary sup -
port measures will increase, with transfers as 
part of the electricity and gas price brake, in 
particular, exceeding the coronavirus assistance 
ending in 2022. Moreover, the fact that high

expenditure, such as on tangible goods pur -
chases, will have a detrimental impact. Military 
expenditure will rise sharply as more funds are 
channelled out of the Armed Forces Fund. 
Lastly, the high level of profit-  related taxes in 
2022 will not be carried over in full to 2023. 
Meanwhile, the cyclical weakness of the real 
economy will not play a major role in the tra -
jectory of the government budget, as inflation 
will be high at the same time and the labour 
market will remain robust. For example, nom -
inal gross wages and salaries will rise sharply, 
which is especially relevant for revenue from 
direct taxes and social contributions – and thus 
for government finances as a whole.
The deficit ratio will then fall sharply in 2024, 
hitting 1¾%, and dip slightly further still to 
1½% in 2025. The main reason for this is that 
the support measures temporarily put in place 
will have already largely come to an end in 
2024 and will have been completely phased 
out by 2025. Rising shortfalls in central govern -
ment’s off- budget entities for climate change 
mitigation and the armed forces will somewhat 
lessen the extent to which the deficit will 
shrink. Moreover, pension expenditure will go 
up significantly: aggregate wage increases will 
be reflected in large pension adjustments, and 
more and more baby boomers will reach retire -
ment age.
The temporary measures are obscuring the 
general government structural balance. At the 
end of the projection horizon, the structural 
deficit will be around 1% of GDP .18 Prior to the 
COVID-  19 crisis, structural surplus of ½% of 
GDP was still recorded in 2019. The reason for 
the deterioration can be attributed to expend -
iture: in particular, spending on pensions, cli -
mate change mitigation and the military, re -
spectively, is rising considerably. By contrast, 
interest expenditure is playing a limited role: 
whilst interest rates have risen sharply and ex -
penditure on inflation- indexed government 
securities is seeing a temporary sharp rise, the 
associated burdens remain rather small. This is 
due to the longer maturities of debt instru -ments and the small share of inflation- linked 
bonds.
According to this projection, the debt ratio will 
shrink this year (2021: 68.6%). This is attribut -
able mainly to the strong growth in nominal 
GDP in the denominator of the ratio. Moreover, 
due to the use of cash reserves accumulated 
during the COVID-  19 pandemic, the deficit will 
not cause the debt level to go up as sharply. 
Government liquidity and capital measures re -
sulting from the energy crisis that are not in -
cluded in the deficit will increase the ratio only 
slightly. The debt ratio will then edge back up -
wards slightly next year. The general govern -
ment deficit will rise significantly and nominal 
GDP will grow at a slower pace than in the cur -
rent year. In addition, loans granted to build up 
capital stock for a funded pension and transfers 
to the IMF trust funds for low- income countries 
will push up the debt ratio. The increase will be 
dampened considerably due to non- recurring 
effects further diminishing. For instance, add -
itional cash reserves from the COVID-  19 pan -
demic will be used to finance the budget, and 
a growing number of assistance loans will 
be  repaid. Furthermore, the scaling- back of 
government- owned bad banks’ portfolios from 
the financial crisis of just over a decade ago will 
continue. In 2024 and 2025, the debt ratio will 
then fall markedly: according to this projection, 
it will amount to around 65% at the end of the 
projection horizon.

are subject to an unusually high level of uncer -
tainty in the current environment. The greatest

countermeasures, and the impact of the high 
inflation. From today’s perspective, the risks to 
economic growth appear to be tilted over -
whelmingly to the downside in overall terms, 
due largely to the possibility of energy supply 
bottlenecks. With regard to inflation, upside 
risks predominate throughout the projection 
horizon.
In the baseline scenario of this projection, it is 
assumed that, despite halted Russian gas deliv -
eries from September onwards, there will be no 
gap in the gas supply. However, the additional 
gas deliveries or gas savings required could also 
be smaller than expected, e.g. due to unusually 
cold weather. This could lead to gas being ra -
tioned, which would go hand in hand with a 
sharp decline in economic output and further 
price increases. Escalating geopolitical tensions 
in connection with the war in Ukraine also 
pose a risk. For example, sanctions could be ex -
panded and supply chains affected by the war 
– those for grain, for instance – could be dis -
rupted more severely or interrupted altogether, 
with potentially severe consequences for global 
and German economic activity. As a result, 
price pressures would probably be further in -
tensified. For information on an adverse risk 
scenario of this nature, see the box on pp. 39 ff.There are also unknowns relating to the gov -
ernment measures implemented to mitigate 
the energy crisis. If, for example, consumer 
electricity or gas prices are still well above the 
levels at which the price brake applies when 
the brake is due to end – as is envisaged in the 
projection – this measure could potentially be 
extended by law. This could cause inflation in 
2024 and 2025 to be lower than expected, 
provided that the rebound effect contained in 
the projection would then be eliminated.19 The 
projected inflation rate could also be lower if 
electricity and gas prices were to fall faster than 
assumed. Economic output would be sup -
ported in both cases, because the longer- term 
lower cost burden for firms and households 
would stimulate investment and consumption. 
However, where this is associated with higher 
energy consumption, this would cause the risks 
arising from energy bottlenecks to increase.
Irrespective of any further possible disruptions 
that could result from the Ukraine war, there 
are other risks to the global economy. For ex -
ample, despite China recently signalling some 
relaxation of its zero- COVID policy, the trajec -
tory of the pandemic in the country could 
cause a global economic slowdown that is 
greater than anticipated. In this context, global 
supply chain problems could also temporarily 
worsen again, with corresponding pressure 
being put on world trade. Lastly, further geo -
political tensions would also entail downside 
risks for both the global economy and the Ger -
man economy. Inflation in Germany could then 
be stronger if, for example, commodity prices 
were to increase or price pressures at the earl -
ier input stages continued to go up. However, 
it is also conceivable that commodity prices 
could fall faster than assumed, e.g. if the global 
economy cools to a greater extent as a result of 
weaker demand. As consumer prices for en -
ergy and food, in particular, are already at very 
high levels, enterprises could then even pass All in all, risks

An adverse risk scenario for the German economy
The macroeconomic projection (hereinafter 
referred to as the “baseline scenario”) re-
mains heavily infl  uenced by the fallout from 
the Russian war of aggression against 
Ukraine and its global economic impact. An 
adverse risk scenario was created on the 
basis of various less favourable assumptions 
about this situation than in the baseline 
scenario. One assumption, for example, is 
that the confl  ict with Russia will be more 
severe and that geopolitical tensions will be 
greater than in the baseline.1 Regarding en-
ergy supply and consumption, it is assumed 
that additional gas deliveries from other 
countries will be smaller, that temperatures 
will be signifi  cantly lower than average in 
the coming and subsequent winter and that 
cuts in gas consumption will be less sub-
stantial. Furthermore, the adverse risk scen-
ario includes additional disruptions to for-
eign trade and heightened supply chain 
problems, whilst exports of food from 
Ukraine are assumed to decline steeply. In 
this scenario, prices for energy and food 
commodities are assumed to rise again and 
remain higher than in the baseline scenario 
over the projection horizon. All of these 
factors contribute to a signifi  cant increase 
in macroeconomic uncertainty and fi  nancial 
market volatility compared with the base-
line scenario.2
Looking at the supply of gas in Germany, 
from December 2022 onwards the combin-
ation of unfavourable developments on the 
supply and demand sides leads to a more 
tense supply situation than in the baseline 
scenario. By mid- 2023, cuts in gas con-
sumption will be only half the size of those 
in the baseline scenario.3 Furthermore, for 
the months from December 2022 to March 
2023 as well as from December 2023 to 
March 2024, temperature- related additional consumption is assumed to be 8% com-
pared with the previous winter periods. In 
the adverse risk scenario, the expansion of 
supply through deliveries of liquefi  ed nat-
ural gas (LNG) in 2023 is two- fi  fths smaller 
than in the baseline scenario – for example, 
owing to delays in expanding Germany’s Major assumptions in the adverse

1 The adverse risk scenario applies assumptions based 
on those employed by ECB staff in a euro area down-
side scenario; see European Central Bank (2022). In 
addition, however, it also takes account of develop-
ments specifi  c to Germany, including in relation to nat-
ural gas supply and demand. For the euro area aggre-
gate, the macroeconomic impact for the euro area 
was calculated directly by ECB staff. The results for 
Germany presented in this box are derived from Bun-
desbank estimates. They were not incorporated into 
the ECB staff’s results for the euro area and therefore 
did not form part of the Eurosystem’s Broad Macro-
economic Projection Exercise.
2 The adverse risk scenario is based on monetary and 
fi  scal policy that is unchanged from the baseline scen-
ario. With regard to fi  scal policy in Germany, this 
means that no additional fi  scal measures that go be-
yond the scope of the automatic stabilisers endogen-
ous to the model are included. The electricity and gas 
price brake is implemented in the same way as in the 
baseline scenario.
3 Up to and including the second quarter of 2023, the 
baseline scenario assumes savings of 20% compared 
with average consumption in the 2018-21 period. 
After that, they are set at 10% on account of decreas-
ing efforts to reduce consumption. The German gas 
exports assumed in both the baseline scenario and the 
adverse risk scenario roughly correspond to the aver-
age monthly outfl  ows since the start of the Russian 
war of aggression against Ukraine. A possible Euro-
pean gas supply compensation mechanism is not expli-
citly incorporated into the adverse risk scenario.Deutsche Bundesbank

LNG capacity or to underutilisation of LNG 
terminals.4 It is also assumed that gas stor-
age facilities will be fi  lled to a minimum of 
15%, e.g. as an emergency reserve to en-
sure a continuous supply of gas to critical 
infrastructures, or because of technical and 
geological restrictions. Natural gas is thus 
rationed if the storage level falls below this 
limit. Given these assumptions, a gas gap of 
12 terawatt hours (TWh) is calculated for 
2023. As gas storage facilities are not en-
tirely full again in the summer of 2023, the gas gap expands to 121 TWh in 2024. This 
corresponds to around 1% and 13%, re-
spectively, of the assumed demand for gas 
in 2023 and 2024.5 By contrast, there is no 
further shortage of gas in 2025, particularly 
given the assumed increase in imports and 
higher utilisation of LNG capacity from the 
summer of 2024 onwards.
The impact of the gas shortages on the real 
economy in 2023 and 2024 is estimated on 
the basis of a production function with con-
stant elasticity of substitution.6 This ap-
proach allows a certain degree of substitu-
tion between gas and the other input fac-
tors of the production function, thus taking 
account of the experience that enterprises 
will have gained in dealing with a gas short-
age. A negligible effect on gross domestic 
product (GDP) is identifi  ed for 2023 owing Potential impact on real GDP in Germany

around 8% in 2023 and 23% in 2024 compared with 
the average imports since 31 August are based on the

Bundestag (2022) and Tagesschau (2022). For informa-
tion on possible bottlenecks in the global market for 
LNG next year, see International Energy Agency 
(2022b).
5 By contrast, in the adverse risk scenario developed 
for the June 2022 macroeconomic projection, the gas 
gap was particularly pronounced in 2023; see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022b). This was due to the assumption 
that Russian gas deliveries would come to a complete 
halt as early as July of this year and that additional im-
ports from other countries would be very limited. In 
actual fact, however, Russia continued to supply Ger-
many with gas up to the end of August, and imports 
from other countries were expanded much more 
strongly than assumed in the June adverse risk scen-
ario. In addition, German gas exports to neighbouring 
countries have declined steeply in recent months and 
consumption has been much lower than in previous 
years, partly because of favourable weather condi-
tions. As a result, gas storage facilities were completely 
full by November of this year.
6 This follows the ECB staff’s approach to scenario cal-
culations for the euro area. In addition to the elasticity 
of substitution, the size of the gas gap and the share 
of natural gas in Germany’s gross national expenditure 
are key variables. For a similar approach, see also Bach-
mann et al. (2022). Cascade effects along the value 
chain are not considered. However, given that the gas 
gap arises with a signifi  cant time lag, these effects 
should play a more minor role anyway: by the fi  rst 
quarter of 2024, many enterprises are likely to have 
taken steps to dampen the effects of gas rationing 
along value chains.Deutsche Bundesbank

to the fairly small gas gap. However, the ra-
tioning effect, taken in isolation, will 
dampen GDP considerably more strongly in 
2024, by just over 1%.
If the assumptions about the international 
setting of the German economy are incorp-
orated into the simulation calculations, the 
overall year- on- year decline in real GDP in 
2023, at around 1½%, is signifi  cantly larger 
than in the baseline scenario.7 This is due 
primarily to the slump in German exporters’ 
sales markets and, in part, to heightened 
uncertainty. Moreover, economic growth is 
also held back by higher commodity prices, 
although this effect is signifi  cantly damp-
ened by the electricity and gas price brake. 
The same is true of the impact on the infl  a-
tion rate. Nevertheless, the rise in consumer 
prices in 2023, at around 8½%, is more 
than 1 percentage point higher than in the 
baseline scenario.
The negative impact of the adverse risk 
scenario is most pronounced in 2024. In-
stead of growing signifi  cantly again as it 
does in the baseline scenario, the German 
economy then shrinks for the second year 
in a row – by ¾% on the year. As the elec-
tricity and gas price brake comes to an end 
in the course of 2024, there is a rebound ef-
fect which more than offsets the dampen-
ing impact of falling crude oil prices on in-
fl  ation. This rebound effect is markedly 
stronger still than in the baseline scenario 
(see the table on p. 35). The infl  ation rate in 
2024, at close to 5½%, is therefore well 
above the fi  gure in the baseline scenario.
It is not until 2025 that the German econ-
omy recovers in the adverse risk scenario, 
too – thanks to the absence of rationing in 
the winter of 2024-25 and easing commod-
ity price pressures. Real GDP grows by 2¾% 
on the year, and thus much more strongly 
than in the baseline scenario. Nevertheless, real GDP is thus only slightly above its start-
ing level in the third quarter of 2022. The 
infl  ation rate, at just above 3%, still exceeds 
the baseline projection for 2025 by three- 
tenths of a percentage point.

through a larger portion of any price decreases 
to their end customers. Inflation rates would 
then fall much more quickly.
There are further downside risks in Germany 
with regard to the housing market. Should resi -
dential real estate prices fall to a greater extent, 
construction activity is likely to slow down even 
more quickly and housing investment could de -
cline more sharply than previously assumed. In 
addition, there would be risks to the financial 
system, which could, in a worst- case scenario, 
have feedback effects on the real economy. 
One consequence would be that the value of 
collateral used to secure real estate loans would 
fall, meaning that, in the event of future credit 
defaults, lenders would suffer higher losses.20
There is also uncertainty in Germany as to the 
degree to which the “demand buffers” formed 
since the outbreak of the pandemic will stabil -
ise. These exist for households in the form of 
savings built up involuntarily during the pan -
demic, and for industrial enterprises in the form 
of an order backlog owing to supply bottle -
necks. In the projection, both factors will coun -
teract, to a certain extent, the headwinds from 
the high inflation and weakening foreign de -
mand. If households’ saving ratio were to fall 
more sharply than expected, private consump -
tion would decline to a lesser degree. More -
over, the temporary boost expected in the ex -
port projection from reducing the order back -
log could be even stronger. Both would bolster 
economic activity.21 At least in the case of the 
former, however, price pressures would also 
continue to increase at the same time.
Looking at the inflation forecast, there are un -
certainties arising from the high inflation dy -
namics themselves. For example, strong wage

round effects of the high inflation, has already 
been baked into the projection. However, infla -
tion compensation bonuses have become a 
relatively important part of recent wage settle -
ments and will reduce the permanent compon -
ent of wage growth. The wage forecast as -
sumes that, once the period in which the one- 
off payments subsidised by the government 
comes to an end, the wage increases agreed 
will be so large that there will be no major set -
back to the wage level in the sectors con -
cerned. Should such a setback occur neverthe -
less, wage growth and the resulting price pres -sure would be noticeably lower in 2025. How -
ever, given the persistently high inflation rates 
and rising inflation expectations, wages could 
also go up even more than projected. This 
would then lead to stronger price increases. As 
things currently stand, this upside risk is likely 
to predominate. In such an environment, en -
terprises could also increasingly try to expand 
their profit margins. This would drive prices up 
even further. Overall, inflation rates could then 
remain at high levels for an extended period of 
time.Looking at infla -

Rise in energy prices, the exchange rate 
of the euro and Germany’s price 
 competitiveness
Energy prices have risen sharply in 2021 and this year, but especially since the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine. For Germany, the price increase this has caused is particularly pro -
nounced compared with many of its trading partners. At the same time, the euro has depreciated 
significantly against the US dollar in the year to date. This article examines the impact on Germa -
ny’s price competitiveness of, first, the relative rise in costs and, second, the depreciation of the 
euro in 2022.
Estimation results show that the uncertain energy supply situation has itself contributed to the 
observed depreciation of the euro against the US dollar. However, it is just one of many causes 
of the depreciation. The swifter tightening of US monetary policy relative to that of the euro area 
probably played a more important role in the euro’s decline. In purely arithmetical terms, the rela -
tive rise in energy costs in Germany from the start of the year to September 2022 – a period in 
which this rise was particularly pronounced – caused Germany’s price competitiveness to deteri -
orate by 0.9%. By contrast, the euro’s losses against the US dollar improved price competitiveness 
by around 1.9% in this period, all other things being equal. This rough calculation illustrates why 
common indicators of price competitiveness still show it to be fairly favourable for Germany and 
to have hardly changed since the end of 2021.
However, when interpreting these indicators, it should be noted that price competitiveness is a 
macroeconomic concept that does not reflect heterogeneities, effects on individual sectors and 
firms, or distributional effects. Firms for which energy makes up a large proportion of total costs 
will, for example, inevitably be more affected by the rise in energy prices than is reflected in the 
macroeconomic indicator of price competitiveness.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Over the past two years, energy prices have 
risen sharply worldwide. In addition to the eco -
nomic recovery following the pandemic-  
induced downturn, this has been driven first 
and foremost by shortages in Russian gas sup -
plies and Russia’s war of aggression against 
Ukraine. Compared with other industrial coun -
tries, the rise in energy costs has been particu -
larly sharp in Germany in the year to date. 
Taken in isolation, such a relative increase in 
costs reduces a country’s price competitive -
ness. At the same time, the euro has depreci -
ated noticeably against the US dollar in the 
year to date. In US dollar terms, goods exports 
from Germany therefore became cheaper and 
thus more competitive.
These considerations raise two questions: to 
what extent is the observed nominal depreci -
ation of the euro against the US dollar itself re -
lated to developments in the energy markets? 
And what effects on Germany’s price competi -
tiveness are the result of the rise in energy 
prices, on the one hand, and the euro’s depre -
ciation, on the other?Uncertainty about the  energy 
supply in the euro area and 
depreciation of the euro
One of the main reasons for the comparatively 
sharp rise in energy costs in the euro area is 
that many Member States previously relied 
heavily on Russian gas supplies. Even before 
the attack on Ukraine, Russia had reduced the 
supply of gas. After the start of the war, Russia 
further restricted supply, and those countries 
previously heavily dependent on Russian gas 
supplies had to obtain gas from other coun -
tries. This sent gas prices worldwide, but espe -
cially in the euro area, sharply higher.1
Germany, like other European countries, thus 
had to spend a larger proportion of its eco -
nomic output on energy imports. At the same 
time, the uncertain supply situation fuelled 
fears of a marked economic slowdown in the 
euro area.2 According to economic theory, 
these developments should weigh on the ex -
ternal value of the euro, particularly against the 
US dollar, as the United States is not hit as hard 
by the impact of the war and is a net exporter 
of energy. In addition, demand for US dollar 
assets is often higher in uncertain times, which 
is another reason why the US currency is appre -
ciating. The depreciation of the euro could 
therefore have been driven largely by develop -
ments in energy prices.
Bundesbank estimates based on vector autore -
gressive (VAR) models do, indeed, suggest that 
higher uncertainty about the supply of gas 
leads to a nominal depreciation of the euro 
against the US dollar (see the box on pp. 48 f.). 
It is not, however, the main reason for the de -
preciation seen since the beginning of 2022 – 
of, on balance, 6.8%3 and at times more than 
15%. The bulk of the depreciation against the Rise in energy

US currency can consequently be attributed to 
other factors. These include, in particular, the 
Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening: 
the faster rise in interest rates across the entire 
maturity spectrum there compared with the 
euro area made portfolio reallocations to the 
United States comparatively attractive and 
thereby exerted downward pressure on the 
euro.
International price 
 competitiveness: indicators 
and current assessment
Irrespective of what has caused the euro’s de -
preciation against the US dollar, the question is: 
to what extent has it contributed to improving 
Germany’s price competitiveness? Nominal de -
preciation makes imports more expensive in 
the domestic currency and renders foreign cur -
rency exports cheaper, and should therefore 
cause a shift in demand for goods towards 
those produced domestically. However, Germa -
ny’s price competitiveness is driven not only by 
the exchange rate against the US dollar, but 
also by the exchange rate against Germany’s 
other major trading partners and, in particular, 
by the relative development of prices and costs 
at home and abroad.
The Bundesbank mainly uses two indicators to 
assess international price competitiveness.4 
First, it tracks an indicator in which the current 
value of a real effective exchange rate is com -
pared with its long- term average.5 In addition 
to the nominal effective exchange rate, the real 
effective exchange rate used here also includes 
the deflator of total sales at home and abroad. 
It has the advantage of taking into account not 
only domestic value added but also the prices 
of imported goods and services, which repre -
sent a cost component of domestic production 
where intermediate goods are imported. More -
over, real exports can be forecast better on the 
basis of broadly defined price and cost indica -
tors, such as the deflators of total sales, than 
using narrowly defined ones.6The chart on p. 50 shows the development of 
this indicator for Germany compared with 26 
selected industrial countries since 1975. Two 
key conclusions can be drawn from its course. 
First, Germany’s price competitiveness can cur -
rently still be regarded as fairly favourable by 
historical standards. Second, as compared with 
the final quarter of 2021, it has hardly changed 
overall despite the (relative) rise in energy 
prices. The reason why price competitiveness 
as measured by this indicator has so far not de -
teriorated despite an increase in aggregate 
relative prices is the euro’s nominal perform -
ance, which has seen the single currency lose 
around 1.6% of its value in trade- weighted 
terms from Germany’s perspective since the 
last quarter of 2021.7… than of the

5 According to the relative purchasing power parity theory, 
nominal exchange rate movements balance out relative in -

real effective exchange rate would have to fluctuate 
around a constant mean.

industrial countries which are part of the above group of 
countries but do not belong to the euro area are con -
sidered here. In some cases, the above- mentioned aggre -
gate relative price increase will already reflect the fact that 
the relative increase in energy prices in Germany vis- à- vis its 
partner countries is passed on as a relative increase in the 
prices of other products.Deutsche Bundesbank

A large number of factors infl  uence fi  nan-
cial market variables like the exchange rate 
of the euro against the US dollar. The fol-
lowing analysis uses a structural vector au-
toregressive (SVAR) model to identify and 
isolate one of these determinants: uncer-
tainty about the future supply of Russian 
gas to Europe.
A VAR model consists of n  variables that 
interact with one another over time. Ex-
pressed mathematically, the reduced form 
of the model to be estimated using data is
yt = c + B1yt-1 + B2yt-2 + … + Bpyt-p + ut,
where y and c are (n x 1 ) vectors of the en-
dogenous model variables and constants, 
respectively, and p is the number of lags in-
cluded. The (n x n) matrices Bi (where i = 1 , 
…, p) contain the estimated regression co-
effi   cients, which indicate how the variables 
are dependent on one another over time. 
Finally, ut represents an (n  x 1) vector of 
errors terms.
A total of seven variables are included in 
the estimation of the model under consid-
eration here in order to capture develop-
ments in the fi  nancial markets as compre-
hensively as possible: the European gas 
price (Dutch TTF natural gas) as a spot price 
and one- month future, the Brent crude oil 
price, the Euro STOXX 50 index, the VIX (a 
measure of implied stock market volatility 
derived from option prices), the yields on 
ten- year German government bonds and, 
fi  nally, the euro- US dollar exchange rate.1 
The reduced form of the model shown 
above is estimated using Bayesian methods 
based on daily data from the start of April 
2020 to mid- December 2022.2The resulting model residuals ût are devi-
ations of the observed data from the values 
predicted by the model. In terms of the 
model, the residuals therefore represent 
surprising changes in the individual vari-
ables. In the model residuals, the underlying 
driving forces are mixed, meaning the 
model residuals themselves are correlated. 
In order to be able to make statements 
about the explanatory contribution of indi-
vidual infl  uencing factors, it is assumed in 
the context of SVARs that the residuals can 
be broken down into mutually uncorrelated 
impulses – referred to as structural shocks – 
permitting a causal interpretation. Proxy 
VAR models, for example, draw on informa-
tion from outside the model itself in the 
form of instrumental variables for this pur-
pose.3 A suitable instrument would be cor-
related with the shock to be identifi  ed 
– here increased uncertainty regarding en-
ergy supply – but not with other potential 
structural shocks.
In the case at hand, an indicator variable 
(i.e. a time series consisting of only zeros 
and ones) is used as an instrument. To this 
1 All of the variables except for yields are included in 
the model in logarithmic form.
2 The fi  nancial markets experienced sharp price de-
clines in March 2020 with the onset of the COVID- 19 
pandemic. The estimation period has been chosen so 
as to deliberately exclude this exceptionally volatile 
period. The number of lags is set to  p = 5, which is 
equivalent to one week for data available on trading 
days. However, this specifi  c choice has hardly any im-
pact on the results. Bayesian methods are often used 
in the literature to estimate VAR models. In this con-
text, certain assumptions are made about the coeffi   -
cients (priors). The actual estimated coeffi   cients are 
then derived from a combination of the priors with in-
formation derived from the data. If, alternatively (as in 
classical frequentist statistics) only data are used for 
the estimation, the results presented here change only 
marginally.

end, various events are identifi  ed which 
could be plausibly interpreted as actual or 
perceived exogenous changes in the supply 
situation and which should have led to an 
immediate increase in the price of gas. 
These include, in particular, Russian an-
nouncements concerning limitation or dis-
continuation of gas supplies.4 The events 
generally increased uncertainty about 
whether the necessary gas supply for euro 
area consumers would be safeguarded 
going forward.
Once the shock is identifi  ed using the in-
strument, impulse response functions can 
be calculated. These show how the shock 
affects the individual variables in the system 
over time. The adjacent chart shows the ef-
fect of an increase in uncertainty about gas 
supply which increases the price of gas by 
10%. A shock of this kind directly reduces 
the market valuation of European equities 
by around 0.7% and leads to a persistent 
depreciation of the euro against the US dol-
lar of between 0.4% and 0.5%.
Finally, the model can be used to estimate 
the extent to which the historical develop-
ment of individual variables can be attrib-
uted to the identifi  ed shock. The chart on 
p. 47 shows that uncertainty about energy 
supply at the beginning of the war was the 
main reason for the short- term depreciation 
of the euro at that time, but also that the 
impact of the shock subsequently lessened 
again for some time. At the beginning of 
the summer months, supply uncertainty 
gradually increased again, but even in late 
summer it accounted for no more than 
around one- third of the euro’s depreci-
ation.54 The events are: 7 March 2022 (Russia threatens to 
halt gas supply via Nord Stream 1), 23 March 2022 
(Russia requires Russian gas to be paid in Russian rou-
bles in future), 14 June 2022 (Russia announces that it 
will cut gas supply via Nord Stream 1 by 40%), 26 July 
2022 (Russia announces that it will cut gas supply via 
Nord Stream 1 to 20%), 22 August 2022 (Russia an-
nounces an unscheduled temporary closure of Nord 
Stream 1 for maintenance, fuelling fears of a delivery 
stoppage), 5 September 2022 (Russia ends gas supply 
via Nord Stream 1 for an indefi  nite period), 27 Sep-
tember 2022 (suspected sabotage of Nord Stream 
pipelines). On each of these dates, the European gas 
price rose by more than 10% compared to the previ-
ous day. To construct the instrument, these identifi  ed 
dates are assigned a value of 1, while all other dates 
are assigned a value of 0.

A second indicator of price competitiveness 
which is frequently used at the Bundesbank is 
based on the productivity approach.8 This indi -
cator is particularly suitable when assessing 
price competitiveness against a broad group of 
countries that also includes emerging market 
economies which are in the process of catching 
up. To calculate indicators based on the prod -
uctivity approach, real exchange rates are ad -
justed for productivity effects using economet -
ric estimates.9 The approach consequently 
takes account of the fact that a higher relative 
price level is not accompanied by a loss of com -
petitiveness if it is due to an increased relative 
productivity level. The Bundesbank calculates 
such an indicator of the German economy’s 
price competitiveness compared with a broad 
group of currently 56 partner countries. This in -
dicator, too, at present suggests a favourable 
competitive position.
One might now ask whether the indicators of 
price competitiveness described here are dis -
torted by the sharp rise in energy prices or, 
more generally, by the high inflation rates. This 
could be the case, in particular, because daily 
values are derived from real exchange rates, 
which are only available at a quarterly or an -
nual frequency, by extrapolation using nominal 
effective exchange rates available at a daily fre -
quency. Since such an extrapolation does not take into account relative price developments, 
very different inflation rates could, in principle, 
lead to a distortion of the indicators. However, 
rough calculations show that such distortions 
are also currently still very small and do not 
change the general finding that Germany’s 
competitive position is fairly favourable at 
present.10Indicator based

8 The problem with competitiveness indicators based solely 
on real effective exchange rates is that they result in a dis -
torted representation of international price competitiveness 
when there are diverging productivity developments at 
home and abroad and associated Balassa-  Samuelson ef -
fects occur. According to the Balassa-  Samuelson model, 
productivity gains in the tradable goods sector are accom -
panied by corresponding wage increases not only in this 
sector itself, but also in the non- tradable goods sector. This 
results in an increase in prices in the domestic sector, a rise 
in the aggregate inflation rate and real currency appreci -
ation. However, this does not reflect deteriorated competi -
tiveness, as the export sector is not affected by the price in -
crease. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2002), Balassa (1964) 
and Samuelson (1964).
9 See Fischer and Hossfeld (2014).
10 The price differential between Germany and the 
weighted average of its trading partners based on con -
sumer price indices can provide an indication of the extent 
of the distortion. For example, from the second quarter of 
2022 through to the quarter for which the data needed to 
calculate the productivity proxy are available, consumer 
prices in Germany have risen by roughly the same magni -
tude as the average of the partner countries. This suggests 
that, at present, the extrapolation does not significantly 
distort the indicator.Deutsche Bundesbank

Rise in energy costs and 
price competitiveness: 
a rough calculation
How are the relative rise in energy prices in Ger -
many, on the one hand, and the nominal depre -
ciation of the euro against the US dollar, on the 
other, now being reflected in the price competi -
tiveness indicators described above? If we first 
look at the impact of the rise in energy costs on 
price competitiveness, we need to determine 
the extent to which this leads to an increase in 
aggregate prices relative to other countries.
It should be borne in mind that energy costs 
account for only part of production costs, 
meaning that the response of the deflator in 
question will be disproportionately small even if 
the costs are passed on in their entirety. The 
lower the energy cost share, the smaller the ef -
fect on the aggregate price level. Using input- 
output tables, the share of energy costs in total 
costs for Germany can be roughly estimated at 
a little over 2%.11
The actual increase in relative energy costs can 
be assessed, for example, using an energy-  
specific producer price index published by the 
Organisation for Economic Co- operation and 
Development (OECD) for industrial econ -
omies.12 For Germany, this index rose by just 
under 30% from the beginning of the year to 
September relative to a trade- weighted aver -
age of 24 partner countries.13 Taking the en -
ergy cost share calculated above of a little over 
2% as the basis, the relative increase in said en -
ergy costs is reflected in a deterioration of 
0.9% in Germany’s aggregate price competi -
tiveness.14
This deterioration was counteracted by the 
euro’s  depreciation against the US dollar over 
the course of the year, which, when taken in 
isolation, improved Germany’s price competi -
tiveness.15 If we consider a group of 26 of Ger -
many’s trading partners in broad analogy to 
the OECD energy- specific producer price index 
used above, the trade weight of the United States amounts to just under 15%.16 The euro’s 
nominal depreciation against the US dollar of 
12.5% observed between January and Septem -
ber thus results in an improvement of 1.9% in 
Germany’s price competitiveness compared 
with the group of countries under analysis.17
The improvement in Germany’s price competi -
tiveness as a result of the euro’s nominal depre -
ciation against the US dollar in the period 
under review from January to September was 
thus markedly larger in purely arithmetical 
terms than its deterioration as a result of the 
relative rise in energy prices in Germany as 
measured by the OECD’s energy- specific pro -
ducer price index.18 Similarly, based on the Relative rise in 
energy costs in 
Germany in 
2022, …
… taking energy 
intensity into 
account, …
… led to a 
deterioration in 
Germany’s price 
competitiveness 
of around 0.9% 
by September
By contrast, 
domestic com -
petitiveness 
improved by 
1.9% in the 
same period 
due to euro 
depreciation 
against US 
dollar 11 The input- output tables of 2019 serve as the basis for 
this estimate. If an aggregate energy component is defined 
in simplified terms as consisting of intermediate inputs of 
different categories of goods, the share of the correspond -
ing expenditure in total costs (“production value”) is 2¼%. 
Relative to gross value added, this would be around 4½%.
12 See also the chart on p. 46.
13 According to this index, the rise in energy costs be -
tween January (before the start of the war) and September 
amounted to 77% for Germany and 36% for the weighted 
average of partner countries. Energy prices in Germany 
thus rose by just under 30% relative to these trading part -
ners. In October, however, energy prices in Germany fell 
again.
14 For the sake of simplicity, this rough calculation assumes 
that energy costs as a share of total costs do not differ sig -
nificantly between the partner countries and Germany. If, 
for example, it were only 1% in the partner countries, Ger -
many’s price competitiveness would have deteriorated by 
1.4%. If energy intensity abroad were higher at 3%, the 
deterioration would only amount to 0.6%. In addition, for 
the sake of simplicity it is assumed that country- specific en -
ergy prices do not differ in terms of their starting level.
15 The following analyses therefore assume, for the sake 
of simplicity, that the euro’s exchange rate against the cur -
rencies of all other trading partners has not changed. In 
reality, the external value of the euro increased slightly in 
trade- weighted terms over the period under review if the 
depreciation against the US dollar is excluded.
16 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2020). Among the 26 trad -
ing partners considered here, Japan and Canada were not 
included in the calculation of the relative increase in energy 
costs in Germany compared with 24 countries owing to a 
lack of data.
17 To harmonise the calculation of the depreciation with 
the relative increase in energy prices calculated above, the 
change in monthly averages of the euro- US dollar ex -
change rate between January and September 2022 was 
used.
18 It should be noted that a rough calculation of this kind 
is highly simplified. For example, no second- round effects 
of the rise in energy prices on other cost components are 
taken into account, and adjustment effects such as a sub -
stitution of energy sources in production or in the demand 
for final products are also disregarded, as are international 
differences in the starting level of energy costs.Deutsche Bundesbank

aforementioned group of 26 trading partners, 
in purely arithmetical terms a 1% nominal de -
preciation of the euro against the US dollar 
would improve Germany’s price competitive -
ness to around the same extent as – in purely 
hypothetical terms – its price competitiveness 
would deteriorate owing to a 6% increase in 
relative energy costs against these countries.19
Classification: price 
 competitiveness as a macro -
economic concept
How can we now assess the finding that Ger -
many’s price competitiveness is currently fairly 
favourable according to our indicators, given 
the fears voiced by many that the rise in energy 
prices poses enormous challenges to parts of 
Germany’s industrial base? To answer this ques -
tion, it should first be borne in mind that the 
exchange rate is a macroeconomic variable and 
that the price competitiveness indicators based 
on it are therefore necessarily a macroeco -
nomic concept as well. Such a concept does 
not capture heterogeneities, the effects on in -
dividual sectors and firms or the distributional 
effects between them. For example, if one par -
ticular sector has a distinctly higher energy cost 
share than the average of the economy as a 
whole, it will be more strongly affected by the 
relatively pronounced rise in energy prices in 
Germany. In addition, a depreciation of the 
euro against the US dollar alone does not ne -
cessarily reduce the price of exports with sales 
markets located in currency areas other than 
the United States.20 Exporters to the United 
Kingdom and Japan, for example, have been 
particularly affected, with their exports invoiced 
in euro even becoming more expensive owing 
to the depreciation of the pound and the yen 
against the euro over the period under review. 
By contrast, exporters to the United States with 
a low energy cost share benefited all the more 
from the depreciation against the US dollar.21
Moreover, it should be borne in mind that inter -
mediate goods – especially a number of energy sources – are often themselves invoiced in US 
dollars.22 A depreciation of the euro against the 
US dollar is therefore itself likely to have a price-  
driving effect on energy costs. If, in an extreme 
case, all intermediate goods are invoiced in US 
dollars, but export revenues come from a third 
currency area and are denominated in euro, the 
profit of an affected firm would not increase as 
a result of the euro’s depreciation, but would 
actually decrease further.
Germany’s currently fairly favourable price 
competitiveness despite the relative rise in en -
ergy costs should therefore be interpreted in 
macroeconomic terms. The result certainly 
does not mean that, just because of the euro’s 
depreciation against the US dollar, the rise in 
energy prices is unproblematic for all domestic 
sectors or firms. Rather, exchange rate move -
ments by their very nature as macroeconomic 
variables affect different sectors or firms in dif -
ferent ways.
Finally, as described here, the depreciation of 
the euro against the US dollar should not be 
seen primarily as a response to the energy crisis 
itself. Instead, it is largely due to other circum -
stances, such as the relatively strong tightening 
of US monetary policy. If these circumstances 
prove to be temporary,23 the exchange rate ef -Price competi -

ation may be

19 This result is approximated by (1/(2¼%))*14.6% ≈ 6.5. If 
a broader group of 56 partner countries is considered, the 
US dollar would have a weight of just over 9%, which 
would result in a value of (1/(2¼%))*9.4% ≈ 4.2.
20 In such a scenario, exporters can still benefit from a de -
preciation of the euro against the US dollar if exports are 
invoiced in US dollars. This is actually the case for many 
goods in global trade, even when the United States is not 
one of the two trading partners (see Gopinath (2015) and 
Gopinath and Itskhoki, (2021)). In such a case, exporters’ 
profit margins would rise if viewed in isolation, provided 
intermediate goods and other cost components are not 
also invoiced in US dollars. If exporters subsequently 
lowered their prices, demand effects would also arise.
21 A demand effect results directly if exports are invoiced 
in euro and thus become cheaper for US importers. If ex -
port goods are invoiced in US dollars, exporters’ profit mar -
gins increase, all other things being equal.
22 However, this does not necessarily apply to trade in nat -
ural gas, for which contracts are often invoiced in euro, at 
least in Europe.
23 For example, the euro has already appreciated again 
against the US dollar since the period up to September 
considered in the calculation.Deutsche Bundesbank

fect improving price competitiveness would 
also disappear in the future. This would then 
worsen Germany’s price competitiveness if the 
sharp rise in energy costs compared with other 
countries were to also prove persistent at the same time. In this respect, therefore, it cannot 
be assumed that relative price shifts emanating 
from the energy market, which may be struc -
tural in nature, will always and permanently be 
absorbed by nominal exchange rate changes.

Access to cash in Germany – results of 
a representative public survey
For the German public to be able to use cash, there needs to be a nationwide and cost- effective 
network of cash dispensers. At the end of 2021, the Bundesbank investigated the state of this cov -
erage as part of a representative public survey. The analysis considers three questions. What is the 
outlay in terms of monetary cost, time and effort involved in withdrawing cash from an auto -
mated teller machine (ATM)? Does provision fall short when it comes to people from rural areas 
or vulnerable groups? And what is the relationship between the individual outlay associated with 
withdrawing cash and the use of cash as a means of payment? This provides insights into whether 
people in Germany are able to pay by cash or cashless means of payment according to their pref -
erences or whether their choice is indirectly impaired by a lack of options for making cash with -
drawals.
The empirical analysis shows that, at present, it is very easy for the German population to access 
cash. Overall, 94% of respondents say they need to exert little or very little effort to get to an 
ATM. The average time required per withdrawal is approximately nine minutes. Vulnerable groups 
report needing somewhat longer. However, they, too, consider the effort involved to be low. 
There is no evidence that rural areas specifically are undersupplied with cash.
A regression analysis does not reveal any statistically significant relationship between the individ -
ual outlay for withdrawing cash and payment behaviour. ATM coverage therefore appears to be 
good enough to allow consumers to pay in cash as and when they wish. In a hypothetical con -
text, however, many respondents state that they would be increasingly inclined to move away 
from cash if provision were to deteriorate significantly. There would then be the danger of a 
downward spiral of reduced cash infrastructure and falling cash usage. Lower cash use entails ris -
ing cost pressures for private sector players in the cash cycle, such as cash- in- transit (CIT) com -
panies and commercial banks. This could cause the existing cash infrastructure to be scaled back 
in the medium or long term, which in turn would adversely affect cash usage.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Changing preferences and new developments 
in the payments space mean that more and 
more purchases are being paid for by card or 
smartphone instead of in cash. This trend was 
amplified by the COVID-  19 pandemic. Never -
theless, cash remains a highly popular means 
of payment. According to a representative Bun -
desbank survey, 58% (2017: 74%) of day- to- 
day payments are still made using cash. The 
general public like that cash protects privacy, 
provides a clear overview of spending and 
means you can rely on the fact that the pay -
ment transaction has been properly settled.1
Of at least equal importance with the benefits 
of cash for the individual is its meaning for so -
ciety as a whole. As the only physical payment 
instrument, cash can be used without inter -
mediaries. This means that it remains largely 
usable even in the event of local power out -
ages or problems with technical infrastructure 
and it constitutes an important component of 
crisis preparedness. It should also be borne in 
mind that some population groups – especially 
children – are not easily able to utilise cashless 
means of payment and are reliant on cash.2
This is why the Bundesbank and the Eurosys -
tem as a whole advocate for freedom of choice 
between cash and cashless means of payment. 
The idea is for citizens to be able to decide for 
themselves whether to pay in cash or use a 
cashless option. For that to work, there needs 
to be an unrestricted and cost- effective supply 
of cash because – unlike in the case of cashless 
means of payment – cash is “used up” when a 
payment is made; the consumer always has to 
source fresh cash for the next time.3
The inherent risk of a cost- driven downward 
spiral makes it all the more important to main -
tain a good cash infrastructure. Alongside the 
Bundesbank, the business of supplying cash 
also involves commercial banks and CIT com -
panies, and those stakeholders are subject to 
economic cost pressures. The provision of cash is fixed- cost intensive, meaning that when cash 
use goes down, unit costs go up – as hap -
pened recently during the COVID-  19 pandemic. 
This cost pressure could lead to a reduction in 
the cash infrastructure in place in the future. 
ATMs that are less frequently used could be 
taken out of operation as a result, for example. 
This could be the start of a downward spiral 
whereby a poorer supply of cash leads to lower 
use of cash, and vice versa. Those members of 
the public who wish to carry on using cash or 
who are reliant on it would be the first to bear 
the brunt of this. But since cash – as a physical 
means of payment  – also constitutes an im -
portant component of crisis preparedness, risks 
for the security of society as a whole may 
ensue.4
With this in mind, the Eurosystem keeps a con -
stant eye on developments with regard to the 
cash infrastructure and, in particular, the avail -
ability of ATMs. There are currently around 
55,000 ATMs in Germany, which equates to 
roughly 70 ATMs per 100,000 inhabitants.5 
That figure has remained broadly stable over 
the past ten years. This places Germany in the 
top quarter of European countries, fundamen -
tally indicating a good state of provision. 
Alongside the number of ATMs, another factor 
that is of at least equal importance is how 
those machines are distributed. They should be 
present wherever they are needed and be avail -
able even in sparsely populated regions. One 
good way of measuring the extent to which 
this requirement is met is to look at the dis -
tance between the place of residence and the 
nearest ATM. According to the ECB, in most Cash has advan -

euro area countries, 95% of the population live 
no more than five kilometres from their nearest 
ATM, as the crow flies.6
This article fleshes out these geographical ana -
lyses for the euro area with findings from a 
public survey carried out in Germany. Using 
data from the Bundesbank’s 2021 payment be -
haviour study, the analysis explores three ques -
tions. First, what is the outlay (in terms of time, 
monetary cost and effort) of withdrawing cash 
from an ATM? Second, does provision fall short 
with respect to people from rural areas or vul -
nerable groups – in other words, people who 
might be disadvantaged, for example, because 
of their social status? And, third, what is the re -
lationship between the individual outlay associ -
ated with withdrawing cash and the use of 
cash as a means of payment?
The results can be used to ascertain how well 
the population in Germany is actually supplied 
with cash. They also enable inferences to be 
made as to whether citizens are able to freely 
choose between cash and cashless means of 
payment when making payments or whether 
proximity to the nearest ATM sometimes makes 
that decision for them.
Data basis: the Bundesbank’s 
2021 payment behaviour study
The following analysis is built on data from the 
“Payment behaviour in Germany” survey. These 
are studies undertaken by the Bundesbank 
every two to three years to examine how con -
sumers in Germany pay and to find out what 
views and opinions exist as far as cash and 
other means of payment are concerned.7 The 
data are representative of the German- speaking 
population aged 18 and over. The survey period 
for 2021 ran from 8 September to 5 December. 
During this time, a total of 5,870 people were 
randomly selected and interviewed by tele -
phone. In addition, 4,197 of these respondents 
completed a diary in which they recorded three days’ worth of purchases together with the 
payment method that they used.
The survey shows that cash is currently the 
most widely used means of payment in Ger -
many, even if its use has declined sharply as a 
result of the COVID-  19 pandemic. 58% of all 
day- to- day payments are settled in cash, which 
corresponds to 30% of expenditure in terms of 
value. In the 2017 survey, these shares stood at 
74% and 48%, respectively. The move towards 
internet shopping and many retailers asking 
customers during the pandemic to refrain from 
paying in cash are the main reasons for this de -
cline. Nonetheless, 69% of respondents con -
sider it important to be able to continue using 
cash in the future.8
This study drew on a sub- sample of 2,487 
people who were asked additional questions 
about cash withdrawals in the telephone inter -
views. Information about the amount and fre -
quency of withdrawals as well as the outlay in -
volved is available for these respondents. To -
gether with the records from the payment diar -
ies, this provides a detailed overview of how 
people in Germany obtain cash and use it to 
make payments.
Cash access points 
in  Germany
People who want to withdraw cash in Ger -
many can choose from various options: ATMs, 
bank counters, and points of sale at retailers 
that offer cash withdrawals as part of a pur -
chase or via a cash service provider (“cashback” 
or “cash- in- shop”).Survey data

The table on this page outlines the relevance of 
the various withdrawal sources in Germany; the 
top section shows general usage while the bot -
tom section focuses on intensity of use. 96% of 
respondents use ATMs for cash withdrawals, 
making 81% of their withdrawals there on aver -
age. These percentages have hardly changed 
since the last survey in 2017. This means that 
ATMs are still by far the most important source 
for withdrawing cash. By contrast, only 20% 
(2017: 38%) of respondents now go to a bank 
counter, where they withdraw on average 11% 
of the cash they need (2017: 14%). Withdrawals 
at the point of sale, on the other hand, have be -
come more significant in recent years, with one 
in three people now making use of this service. 
Overall, respondents withdraw on average 8% 
of their cash this way.
Although a growing number of retailers now 
allow customers to make withdrawals at the 
point of sale, this type of cash supply is more of 
a complementary solution than a fully-  fledged 
alternative to bank- operated ATMs. With -
drawal at the point of sale usually requires the 
customer to purchase goods at the shop offer -
ing the service and is only possible during the 
shop’s opening hours.9 Moreover, the cash is 
not checked for authenticity by machine before 
it is paid out. Lastly, withdrawals at the point of 
sale are only available if the till contains cash withdrawn from ATMs or bank counters by 
customers making cash payments over and 
above the amount the cashiers need to make 
change. This article therefore focuses in par -
ticular detail on access to the bank- based cash 
infrastructure, i.e. ATMs and bank counters. 
These cover most of the everyday need for 
cash and guarantee that cash can be supplied 
even if retailers experience technical disrup -
tions or in the event of a crisis (see also the box 
on pp. 59 f.).
Outlay involved in with-
drawing cash from ATMs 
and bank counters
How well can the general public access cash? 
To capture the outlay involved in making with -
drawals from ATMs or bank counters, respond -
ents were asked first to describe their usual 
route there and then to assess the effort re -
quired. This may depend, for example, on how 
long the journey is, what means of transport is 
used, whether the withdrawal can be com -
bined with other errands and whether fees are 
charged for the withdrawal.
The first aspect –  the situations in which re -
spondents withdraw cash and the means of 
transport they use when doing so – are sum -
marised in the table on p. 61. Most people com -
bine cash withdrawals with going shopping 
(47%) or to work (17%), meaning that the out -
lay is less of a factor. Only 15% leave home 
solely to get cash out. In total, when withdraw -
ing cash, 58% of respondents travel by car, 21% 
on foot, 12% by bicycle and 8% by public trans -
port. The most common scenario involves with -
drawing cash while going shopping by car.10

Increased demand for cash due to card reader disruptions
From the second half of May 2022, Ger-
many experienced frequent disruptions to 
retail card payments due to a software error 
affecting a certain type of card payment 
terminal which is used by many large retail 
chains. The EHI Retail Institute estimates 
that around 10% of all terminals in Germa-
ny’s retail sector were affected by the dis-
ruptions.1 Until the problems were resolved, 
only cash payments were accepted at the 
businesses affected.
At the same time, the Bundesbank branches 
registered unusually large deposits and 
withdrawals of cash, indicating its increased 
use in the retail sector. In August, the Bun-
desbank conducted a public survey in order 
to shed more light on the causes of the in-
crease in cash turnover and the effects of 
the disruptions. In the Bundesbank Online 
Panel – Households (BOP- HH), a representa-
tive monthly online survey of several thou-
sand people, respondents reported the ex-
tent to which they were affected by the dis-
ruptions and what consequences this had 
for their personal behaviour.
As shown in the adjacent chart, 29% of re-
spondents were personally affected by the 
disruptions. Moreover, 32% were not af-
fected but had heard about them, whereas 
39% were wholly unaware of the problems.
What did the disruption mean for respond-
ents’ shopping? Of those affected, 62% 
had enough cash on them and were able to 
continue shopping without any problems (see the upper chart on p. 60). People who 
had insuffi   cient cash bought less (13%), 
stopped shopping in order to get cash 
(15%), or stopped shopping altogether so 
they could pay by card later or elsewhere 
(11%).
The results show that the majority of those 
affected were able to continue shopping 
unhindered because they had suffi   cient 
cash in reserve. According to the Bundes-
bank’s payment behaviour study, people in 
Germany carry an average of €100 in cash – 
a fairly high transaction balance compared 
with other European countries, which actu-
ally proved useful when the disruption oc-
curred.2
What did consumers do as a consequence 
of the incidents, and do they carry more 
cash on them to be safe? Looking at the 
group of people who had heard about the 
disruptions and/ or were affected by them, 
18% reported carrying more cash in re-
serve, at least for a short period of time. 
While 11% always carry more cash, 71% 
have not made any change to their cash re-

serves because of the disruptions (see the 
lower chart on this page).
The analysis confi  rms increased demand for 
cash in connection with the disruptions to 
card terminals in Germany. Around 75% of 
those affected made their purchases in cash 
instead of using a card as planned. This 
underscores the importance of a nation-
wide, bank- operated cash infrastructure in 
the event of crisis or disruption. Without 
Germany’s broad network of ATMs and 
bank branches, retailers and consumers 
would potentially have faced much greater 
problems.Impact of the card terminal disruption on cash reserves*

ter? Respondents were asked how much time 
the round trip or the detour took them, and 
how long it took to make the withdrawal itself. 
The chart below shows the average time taken 
and its distribution. On average, it takes re -
spondents nine minutes to get cash. 55% of re -
spondents need no more than five minutes, 
and 75% no longer than ten minutes. Only 1% 
need three- quarters of an hour or more.11
Besides involving a logistical effort, withdraw -
als can be subject to fees. The top chart on 
p. 62 shows how often respondents have to 
pay charges when withdrawing cash. Overall, 
82% of respondents report never or only rarely 
having to pay fees, while a total of 9% say they 
are charged fees more frequently and as many 
as 5% pay a fee for every withdrawal.12
The statistics presented so far suggest that the 
time and monetary outlay involved in with -
drawing cash from ATMs or bank counters in 
Germany is low. But how do the respondents 
themselves assess their outlay? 94% say it is 
very or fairly easy to get to an ATM or bank 
counter (see the bottom chart on p. 62), while 
only 6% find it fairly or very difficult. In a survey 
conducted by the ECB in 2019 for the euro area 
as a whole, 9% of respondents reported that it 
was very difficult to access cash.13 The outlay in Germany, then, appears to be lower than the 
European average.Three- quarters

What is the provision of cash like for vulnerable 
groups of people in particular, i.e. people who 
might be socially disadvantaged owing to their 
health or social status? In the following, re -
spondents’ age and employment status are 
used as indicators to assign them to this group. 
A comparison shows that people over the age 
of 65, those who are unemployed and people 
unfit for work take on average 3.8 minutes 
longer to withdraw cash from ATMs than other 
people. Nevertheless, they consider the outlay 
involved to be similarly low. This could be be -
cause of a certain type of habituation effect as 
they may also be accustomed to facing chal -
lenges in other areas of their lives. By contrast, they are charged fees somewhat less often, 
possibly because they make more specific ef -
forts to avoid them and instead accept that 
they may have to make a longer journey to 
withdraw cash.
A comparison of the urban and rural popula -
tion shows that it takes people living in rural re -
gions roughly the same amount of time to 
withdraw cash from ATMs as people who live 
in a town or city. They, too, consider the outlay 
involved to be low. There is thus no evidence 
that rural areas specifically are undersupplied 
with cash.14 It is worth noting, however, that 
people in rural regions are more likely to travel 
by car when withdrawing cash, mostly in con -
nection with other activities. As a result of 
poorer local amenities and transport infrastruc -
ture, people in rural regions have higher mobil -
ity costs overall. However, the additional outlay 
involved in withdrawing cash does not appear 
to be a factor in this.
The relationship between 
the outlay involved 
in  obtaining cash and 
withdrawal  and payment 
 behaviour
Findings collected from the interviews show 
that, on the whole, the outlay involved in with -
drawing cash from ATMs is limited for most 
people in Germany. All the same, there are 
some who have further to travel to reach an 
ATM or who are charged withdrawal fees. Do 
these individuals adjust their withdrawal behav -
iour in response to this greater outlay? Or do 
they go so far as to reduce the amount of cash 
they use?

Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956), an increased Vulnerable

outlay per withdrawal (time involved or in the 
form of fees) lowers withdrawal frequency. 
Consequently, individuals may choose, for ex -
ample, to regularly withdraw larger amounts, 
hold cash in reserve or additionally withdraw 
cash at the point of sale. But it is also conceiv -
able that they would reduce their demand for 
cash and (by necessity) use cashless means of 
payment more frequently. In this case, using 
cash as a means of payment would be restricted 
by the high outlay involved in obtaining it.
To find answers to these questions, various lin -
ear regression models are estimated below in 
which respondents’ withdrawal and payment 
behaviour (dependent variable) is attributed to 
the outlay involved in obtaining cash (explana -
tory variable).15 The dependent variables used 
to describe withdrawal behaviour are (i) the 
number of ATM withdrawals per year, (ii) 
whether a person withdraws cash to keep in re -
serve and (iii) withdrawals at the point of sale as 
a share of total annual withdrawals. Dependent 
variables describing payment behaviour are (iv) 
the share of cash payments made at shops 
measured by the number of transactions and (v) 
by the value of the transactions. Explanatory 
variables that reflect the outlay involved in ob -
taining cash are the time involved in making 
withdrawals and whether a person often pays 
fees when withdrawing cash. In addition, the 
models contain numerous socio- demographic 
control variables. The models describing with -
drawal behaviour ((i) to (iii)) also contain the 
sum withdrawn annually at ATMs, the point of 
sale and bank counters. In other words, they 
analyse how individuals adjust their withdrawal 
behaviour for each type of cash use.
Descriptive statistics on the variables used can 
be found in the adjacent table. Looking at 
withdrawal behaviour, the statistics show that 
respondents visit ATMs an average of 31 times 
a year. 43% withdraw cash to keep it in re -
serve. In addition, 8% of respondents’ total 
withdrawals are made at the point of sale. 
Looking at payment behaviour, the statistics 
show that respondents make an average of 59% of their shop purchases in cash, which 
corresponds to 48% of their expenditure.16
The results of the regressions (coefficients and 
standard errors) can be found in the above 
table. Columns (i) to (iii) show how withdrawal

cash are related, while columns (iv) and (v) con -
cern payment behaviour. Statistically significant 
correlations can be seen with regard to with -
drawal behaviour (columns (i) to (iii)). For ex -
ample, if respondents need five minutes longer 
to make an ATM withdrawal, they make on 
average one less trip to the ATM a year (and in -
stead withdraw larger amounts). Furthermore, 
the probability of cash being kept in reserve 
after it is withdrawn increases by somewhat 
more than 1 percentage point, while the share 
of cash withdrawn at the point of sale goes up 
by 0.75 percentage point.17 Individuals who are 
at least occasionally affected by fees make an 
average of four fewer withdrawals per year (and instead withdraw larger amounts). How -
ever, fees do not appear to affect whether cash 
is kept in reserve after it is withdrawn or 
whether withdrawals are made at the point of 
sale. Overall, the regression results for with -
drawal behaviour are consistent with the eco -
nomic model.18Regression

17 In a complementary analysis, a number of interaction 
terms were used to determine whether the means of trans -
port used by respondents plays a role when it comes to the 
time it takes to travel to an ATM. This was not the case.
18 As a robustness check, in a further estimation of model 
(i), the share of withdrawals at the point of sale was in -
cluded as an explanatory variable. This variable can be seen 
as an additional proxy for payment method preference. 
The inclusion had hardly any effect on the coefficients of 
the outlay variables.Deutsche Bundesbank

By contrast, looking at payment behaviour (col -
umns (iv) and (v)) reveals no statistically signifi -
cant correlations with the individual outlay in -
volved in obtaining cash. In the estimated 
models, the amount of cash used by respond -
ents cannot be explained by the cost of with -
drawing it. The regression therefore does not 
give any indication that cash use might cur -
rently be restricted by an excessive outlay in -
volved in obtaining it.
In addition to the regression analysis, the em -
pirical relationship between the outlay involved 
in obtaining cash and withdrawal and payment 
behaviour can also be approached using hypo -
thetical scenarios. To this end, survey partici -
pants were asked the following question: “As -
sume it took 5 (or 10 or 15) minutes longer 
than it does now to reach the nearest ATM or 
bank counter belonging to your bank or sav -
ings bank. What would you probably do in this 
case?” The responses are shown in the adja -
cent chart.
Five extra minutes to reach an ATM would have 
no impact on 56% of respondents. Still, 42% 
would adjust their withdrawal behaviour by 
withdrawing less frequently at ATMs, instead 
withdrawing larger amounts (22%) and/  or 
withdrawing cash at the point of sale (20%). 
13% would even (additionally) change their 
payment behaviour and use less cash. As the 
amount of time to reach an ATM increases (10 
or 15 extra minutes), even more respondents 
lean towards adjusting their behaviour. At 15 
minutes, only one- third of respondents would 
withdraw cash and use it to make payments as 
before. Overall, 61% would adjust their with -
drawal strategy and 20% would use less cash. 
So if the number of ATMs were reduced, many 
consumers would adjust not only their with -
drawal behaviour but also their payment be -
haviour. These individuals would then be 
limited in their freedom to choose between 
cash and cashless means of payment.Conclusion
Empirical analysis of data from the 2021 pay -
ment behaviour study shows that the general 
public in Germany still has very good access to 
cash. Overall, 94% of respondents estimate 
that the outlay involved in making withdrawals 
at ATMs is either low or very low. The average 
time required per withdrawal is approximately 
nine minutes. Vulnerable groups report need -
ing somewhat longer. However, they, too, con -
sider the effort involved to be low. There is no 
evidence that rural areas specifically are under -
supplied with cash.
A regression analysis of the data shows statis -
tically significant correlations between the out -
lay involved in withdrawals and withdrawal be -
haviour. The results suggest that those who are 
currently faced with a higher outlay adjust their 
withdrawal behaviour in an economically ra -
tional manner by withdrawing higher amounts … but payment 
behaviour 
remains the 
same

of cash at ATMs that they then keep in reserve 
or by withdrawing additional cash at the point 
of sale. However, the regression does not show 
any statistically significant correlations between 
the outlay involved in withdrawals and the use 
of cash as a means of payment. At the mo -
ment, access to cash can be interpreted in such 
a way that consumers are largely free to choose 
whether or not to use cash at the point of sale. 
In other words, the Eurosystem’s objective of 
ensuring the freedom of choice between cash 
and cashless means of payment does not ap -
pear to be impaired at present.
In a hypothetical context, however, many re -
spondents state that they would be increas -ingly inclined to move away from cash if the 
supply of cash were to deteriorate significantly. 
In this scenario, they would be limited in their 
choice of means of payment. Furthermore, this 
risks setting in motion a cost- driven downward 
spiral: if cash usage were to fall, cost pressures 
would rise for private sector stakeholders in the 
cash cycle, such as CIT companies and com -
mercial banks. This could cause the existing 
cash infrastructure to be further scaled back in 
the medium or long term, which in turn would 
adversely affect cash usage. In order to prevent 
such a turn of events in the Eurosystem, it is 
important to continue statistically recording 
and evaluating the use and availability of cash.

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates

therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.
8 Calculated as the sum of the “Deposit facility”, “Banknotes in circulation” and “Credit
institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

an agreed maturity and all loans excluding revolving loans and overdrafts, credit card

interest.  7 Estimated. The volume of new business is extrapolated to form the
underlying total using a grossing-up procedure.  8 Including non-financial corporations’

values for Germany deviated from the final data by a maximum of 0.1% for employees
subject to social contributions, by a maximum of 0.9% for persons solely in jobs
exempt from social contributions, and by a maximum of 28,1% for cyclically induced
short-time work.  10 From May 2022, calculated on the basis of new labour force fig-
ures. 11 Initial preliminary estimate by the Federal Statistical Office.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland,
Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were
used.  2 Includes countries belonging to the group EER-19 and additionally Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico,Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB suspends
the publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against
Russian rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation
of effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from
that date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of
Russia in conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to
the US dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 in-
cluding Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta,
from 2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia,
from 2015 including Lithuania) as well as Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  5 Euro area countries (current
composition) and countries belonging to the group EER-19.  6 Euro area countries (cur-
rent composition) and countries belonging to the group EER-42.
