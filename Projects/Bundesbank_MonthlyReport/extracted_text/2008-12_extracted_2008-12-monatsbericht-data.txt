5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a whole
After mid-year, the German economy was
increasingly feeling the effects of the ongoing
slowdown in the world economy and the
escalating crisis in the international financial
markets. Real GDP in the third quarter of 2008
was down by a seasonally and calendar-
adjusted 0.5% on the preceding three-month
period, compared with a decline of 0.4% in
the second quarter, which was partly for
technical reasons. After adjustment for calen-
dar effects, there was a 0.8% increase on the
year.
The considerable external pressure was offset
by stabilising tendencies on the domestic
side. Private consumption, for example, in-
creased slightly during the summer months
following a steady decline in the previous
three quarters. This was due primarily to the
fact that, despite the considerable price-
related withdrawal of purchasing power in
the case of households, there was a further
increase in employment and a number of
higher pay agreements came into effect. The
global economic downturn and the marked
decline in prices in the international stock
markets are, however, likely to result in in-
creasingly negative confidence and wealth
effects. The fact that consumer confidence is
still fragile is also reflected by the persistently
high saving ratio in the third quarter. The
strong build-up of inventories in the reporting
period is to be seen in connection with the
sharp growth in imports. While general
government stepped up its investment inGDP in 2008

6construction work again somewhat in the
third quarter, investment in residential con-
struction remained unchanged in seasonal
and calendar-adjusted terms. Fixed invest-
ment by enterprises nevertheless still main-
tained the high level achieved in the second
quarter. Even so, industrial investment, which
has also been characterised by greater cau-
tion recently, is already reflecting the fact that
capacity utilisation has now shown a marked
fall as a result of declining demand in the
economy as a whole.
Like the second quarter, the third quarter was
characterised, in particular, by a lack of stimu-
lus from exports. The global economic down-
turn, which hardly any economic area has
been able to escape recently, has been
placing a growing strain on German exports.
Against this backdrop, nominal exports of
goods were still holding up quite well in Oc-
tober. With a seasonally adjusted decline of
0.5% on September, they were virtually at
the level of the previous quarter. By contrast,
nominal imports of goods in October, at
3.5%, were clearly down on the rather high
September figure. The sharp reduction in the
cost of commodities, especially energy prices,
is likely to have played a key role in this. The
foreign trade surplus went up to 3153/C254billion
in October.
Industry
Industrial activity deteriorated sharply at the
beginning of the fourth quarter, whereas the
cyclical slowdown had been comparatively
moderate in the second and third quarters,
not least owing to large reserves of orders.Economic conditions in Germany*

Monthly Report

7Seasonally adjusted industrial output in Octo-
ber was down 2.2% on September, when aconsiderable decline had already been record-ed. Given the holiday-related shifts in outputin the third quarter, the acceleration in theeconomic downturn is reflected more by thefact that output in October was 3
1/C252% down
on the quarter, compared with a fall of nomore than 1% in the second and third quar-ters. Even though industry is now affected ona broad front by the slowdown in economicactivity, there are still discernible sectoral dif-ferences. For example, the sales problems inthe motor vehicle industry in October werealso clearly visible in the upstream productionsectors, such as in the manufacture of basicmetals. By contrast, the mechanical engineer-ing sector and the chemicals industry, for ex-ample, cut back their output by a compara-tively small amount.
The decline in the demand for industrial
goods has continued at a faster pace sincelate summer. Orders received fell by a season-ally adjusted 6.1% in October, compared witha decline of 8.3% in September. Orders fromeuro-area partner countries have been tend-ing to be conspicuously weak recently. Produ-cers of intermediate and capital goods, whohad benefited previously from the favourableeconomic setting, were hit harder than mostby the decline in demand. This was due, notleast, to their heavy dependence on exports.Orders of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers also showed an extremely sharp de-cline, not only for export but also domestically.Construction
Construction output fell sharply again in Oc-
tober in seasonally adjusted terms (-3.0%),after it had been tending to stagnate in thesecond and the third quarters. No new stimuliwere being generated by the building indus-try or civil engineering in the period underreview. According to the figures on ordersreceived, which are currently available up toSeptember, there could, in future, be a slightrecovery in housing construction and stateinfrastructure measures. Nevertheless, therewas a seasonally adjusted decline in demandfor industrial construction work in the thirdquarter.
Labour marketAccording to initial estimates by the Federal
Statistical Office, there was a further season-ally adjusted rise in employment in October,despite the marked cooling of the economy.The number of persons in work went up by37,000, which was 518,000, or 1.3%, up onthe year. The majority of these were probablypersons in employment subject to social se-curity contributions. According to calculationsby the Federal Employment Agency, the num-ber of such persons in September was 2.1%higher than one year previously. In November,the Ifo employment barometer, which reflectsthe situation in trade and industry, showedthat firms were becoming significantly lesswilling to recruit new staff. By contrast, theseasonally adjusted number of job vacanciesreported to the Federal Labour Agencyshowed only a slight fall on the month.

8In November, the official seasonally adjusted
unemployment figure was 3.15 million. This
was 10,000 fewer than in October. The de-
cline was confined to job seekers receiving
the basic welfare allowance, while there was
a slight increase in the number of job seekers
receiving unemployment benefits under the
statutory insurance scheme, which is more
susceptible to cyclical influences. The un-
employment rate remained unchanged at
7.5%, which was 1 percentage point down
on the year.
Prices
There was a sharp fall in crude oil prices
against the backdrop of the continuing de-
terioration in the global outlook for growth.
At the end of the period under review, the
price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at
US$48. In the futures markets, a premium of
US$83/C254was being charged for six-month
deliveries; the figure for 18-month deliveries
was a much as US$171/C254. This means that the
market players are expecting prices to go up
again in the medium term.
In the wake of falling crude oil prices, import
prices went down by a seasonally adjusted
3.5% in October. The year-on-year increase
went down from 7.6% in September to
2.9%. If energy is excluded, the year-on-year
figure at the end of the period under review
was 1.4%. The cost of domestically produced
industrial goods was down by a seasonally
adjusted 0.2% on the month. The overall
year-on-year price rise was 7.8%, or 2.9% if
energy is excluded.According to the estimate based on data
from the German federal states, seasonally
adjusted consumer prices showed a further
fall in November. Fuel and heating oil became
significantly cheaper. There were large reduc-
tions in the prices of some processed food
products. By contrast, services are likely to
have become more expensive owing, primar-
ily, to sharp price rises for package holidays.
The year-on-year increase in the national con-
sumer price index (CPI) fell from 2.4% in Oc-
tober to 1.4%, not least owing to a baseline
effect in the case of energy and food. The
corresponding figure for the Harmonised
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 1.5% in
November, compared with 2.5% in the previ-
ous month.
Public finances1
Updated stability programme
On 3 December 2008, the Federal Cabinet
endorsed an updated stability programme for
the period up to 2012 and, under the Euro-
pean budgetary surveillance procedure, trans-
mitted it to the ECOFIN Council and the Euro-
pean Commission. In line with the most re-
cent government forecast in October, the
programme is based on assumed growth in
real gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.7% in
2008 and 0.2% in 2009. Production capacity

9is expected to be underutilised in 2009. The
forecast predicts that growth will roughlymatch potential from 2010 to 2012 (an aver-age of 1
1/C252% per year), thus remaining below
normal capacity utilisation. However, sincethe October forecast the economic outlookhas deteriorated.
2
A balanced general government budget is ex-pected for 2008. For 2009, however, the Fed-eral Government has forecast a renewed def-icit, rising to 1
1/C252% of GDP in 2010. This is
due mainly to the weak macroeconomic mo-mentum, which has also left its mark on pub-lic sector budgets, and the recent deficit-increasing economic stabilisation measurestaken by the Federal Government. But it ispartly attributable, too, to the increase in in-come tax allowances for contributions to theprivate and statutory health and long-term
care insurance schemes as of 2010 in accord-ance with a ruling by the Federal Constitu-tional Court. By contrast, the revenue lossesthat will ensue from the Court’s recent rulingupholding the commuter’s tax allowancecould not be factored into the forecast. By2012, the deficit ratio is expected to fall to
1/C252% without – in the view of the Federal Gov-
ernment – further policy measures beingrequired to achieve this. In structural terms(ie after adjustment for cyclical effects andtemporary factors), the fluctuations in thedeficit development are less pronounced be-cause the favourable cyclical influences in2008 and the unfavourable influences in thecoming years are filtered out.

10objective of a structurally balanced budget
has been relinquished; now, the target is a
value of between 0% and1/C252% of GDP . This
target will not be achieved in the short term
but should be met again from 2011 onwards.
The financial market crisis is cited as the rea-
son for this temporary deviation from target.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is not initially expected
to decline further in 2008 and 2009 owing to
government support measures for financial
institutions and the economic downturn. It is
not expected to fall again until 2010, but the
60% reference value stipulated in the EC
Treaty will continue to be exceeded in 2012.
Overall, despite the more favourable starting
point this year, the planned debt develop-
ment at the current juncture is significantly
less favourable than predicted in the Decem-
ber 2007 stability programme. This is largely
attributable to the negative cyclical influences
and deficit-increasing measures adopted in
the intervening period.
In the updated stability programme, the Fed-
eral Government stresses that the Stability
and Growth Pact offers sufficient scope for
adequately dealing with the financial market
crisis. In certain cases, the stipulated ceiling of
3% for the deficit ratio can be exceeded by
an EU member state without triggering an ex-
cessive deficit procedure. However, the Fed-
eral Government regards it as important that
the pact is implemented in such a way that
structural consolidation of public finances re-
mains a focus of fiscal policy even in econom-
ically difficult times. On a national level, it
aims to lastingly keep the budget close to bal-
ance in structural terms by reforming the fis-
cal constitution in the second phase of thereform of the federal structure. This is also
intended as a signal for strengthening the
Stability and Growth Pact.
Statutory health insurance scheme
In the third quarter of 2008, the statutory
health insurance scheme recorded a deficit of
31/C252billion. By contrast, the health insurance
institutions’ budgets had been close to bal-
ance in the same period last year. While total
revenue rose by almost 31/C252%, expenditure
grew by 41/C252%. As the employment trend re-
mained positive and wage increases were
comparatively high, receipts from contribu-
tions increased by just over 3%. Income sub-
ject to contributions (basic wage total) rose
by just over 21/C252%. In addition, the average
contribution rate in the third quarter, at just
over 14.9%, was somewhat higher than a
year earlier (14.8%). However, basic wages
grew more slowly than gross wages and sal-
aries (+4%) as the contribution base for the
statutory health insurance scheme also in-
cludes expenditure on pensions, which did
not rise as sharply. Moreover, a large part of
the additional revenue generated through
employment growth was offset by a decline
in the – somewhat lower – contributions paid
on behalf of recipients of unemployment
benefit.
The statutory health insurance scheme’s ex-
penditure on benefits rose by just under
41/C252% overall. At just under 6%, the increase
in spending on out-patient treatment was
particularly strong due again, in part, to the
sharp rise in expenditure on out-patient oper-
ations – which is not capped by existingStability and

11budget ceilings. By contrast, growth in pay-
ments for hospital treatment weakened sig-nificantly to just over 2%. The rise in expend-iture on pharmaceuticals was likewise consid-erably below that of the preceding quarters.However, spending was still up by 4
1/C252%o n
the year. At +101/C252%, by contrast, the in-
crease in outlays for sickness benefit acceler-ated again.
The cumulative deficit in the statutory health
insurance scheme in the first nine months of2008 came to 31
1/C252billion. The deterioration
compared with the three-quarter result lastyear, when a marginal surplus was recorded,was due primarily to the strong growth in ex-penditure. Owing to the relatively sharp in-crease in per capita earnings negotiated in
the collective wage agreements and the on-going stability in the employment situation,revenue from contributions is expected tocontinue to develop favourably until the endof 2008. If the recent slight deceleration inexpenditure growth continues, the usual sea-sonal surplus for the final quarter could besufficient to achieve a balanced result for theyear as a whole. Those individual health insur-ance institutions which still have debts shouldhave eliminated them completely by the endof the year, while the debt-free institutionsshould by then have accumulated significantreserves again.
In the coming year, the new arrangements
for outpatient doctors’ remuneration
3and
additional funding for hospitals4could lead to
additional expenditure of around 341/C252billion.
There will also be additional spending arisingfrom the overall expenditure dynamics. Tofinance this, the uniform contribution rate to
be introduced on 1 January 2009 has beenset at 15.5%, 0.6 percentage point higherthan the average contribution rate in 2008.This will lead to additional revenue – aboveand beyond the increase in the basic wagetotal – of almost 36
1/C252billion. Furthermore, a

3Owing to budgeting, the price of a benefit has general-
ly been determined up to now ex post. In future, remu-
neration rates will be determined ex ante, which means
that extensions of the range of benefits provided will
have a direct effect on the volume of expenditure. Spend-
ing growth is to be curbed by specifying standard benefit
volumes. If these are exceeded, the remuneration rates
are to be lowered progressively.
4Under the Reform act on hospital financing (Kranken-
hausfinanzierungsreformgesetz), rises in staff costs ex-
ceeding the basic wage trend are to be partly reimbursed
by the health insurance institutions. In addition, the dis-
count of 0.5% granted by the health insurance institu-
tions will no longer apply. There will also be additional
expenditure to increase nursing staff numbers and on
psychiatric treatment and training.A balanced

12grant is envisaged. Overall, the revenue of
the new health insurance fund should thus be
sufficient to fully cover health insurance insti-
tutions’ expenditure. However, should spend-
ing increase more rapidly than expected, indi-
vidual health insurance institutions may be
forced very soon to demand an additional
contribution from their members. If, by con-
trast, revenue is lower than expected owing
to a sharp economic downturn, this would
initially place a burden on the health insur-
ance fund because its payments to the health
insurance institutions are already fixed for
2009. The health insurance fund might then
require liquidity assistance from the Federal
budget, which would have to be repaid in the
following year.Public long-term care insurance scheme
In the third quarter, the public long-term care
insurance scheme recorded a surplus of just
under 31/C252billion following a marginal deficit
a year ago. Revenue surged by 161/C252%, which
is primarily attributable to the increase in the
contribution rate from 1.7% to 1.95% (plus
the special contribution of 0.25% for the
childless) on 1 July 2008. Expenditure growth
accelerated to +51/C252% in connection with
the first rise in the benefit rates since the
public long-term care insurance scheme was
introduced. In the first three quarters, the
public long-term care insurance institutions
recorded a close-to-balance budget. Com-
bined with the effect of the contribution rate
increase, end-of-year bonus payments mean
that receipts from contributions are likely to
be particularly high in the final quarter, raising
the prospect of a surplus for the year as a
whole.
In 2009, the rise in the contribution rate
will continue to generate additional revenue
in year-on-year terms up until mid-year.
Although additional expenditure is also to be
expected owing to higher nursing care rates
and, in particular, the extension of benefits
for people suffering from dementia,5the
revenue-boosting effect will probably pre-
dominate on balance, thus increasing theFinances of the public long-

5Following the implementation of the adjustments stipu-

2008, 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2012, the long-term
care benefit rates are to be reviewed every three years
from 2014 to establish whether they should be adjusted
in line with cumulative price developments. If wages and
salaries decrease in real terms, then benefit rates are to
be adjusted at most in line with nominal increases in

Securities markets
Bond market
In October 2008, issuing activity on the Ger-
man bond market amounted to 3150.6 bil-
lion in gross terms (compared with 3134.1
billion in the previous month). After de-
ducting redemptions and taking account of
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds, the volume of outstanding domestic
bond securities decreased by 318.1 billion,
however, compared with net redemptions of
320.1 billion in September. Foreign debt
securities, which were predominantly denom-
inated in euro, were also redeemed in net
terms ( 321.0 billion). Overall 339.1 billion
was therefore returned to investors.
German credit institutions reduced their bond
market debt by 323.5 billion in October. This
was attributable to net redemptions of other
bank debt securities which can be structured
flexibly and of public Pfandbriefe ( 317.4 bil-
lion and 312.8 billion respectively). By con-
trast, 36.2 billion worth net of debt securities
issued by specialised credit institutions were
sold. A smaller quantity of mortgage Pfand-
briefe was also placed in the market ( 30.5 bil-
lion).The public sector raised 33.0 billion in the
capital market. On balance, state govern-
ments sold 33.2 billion worth of debt secur-
ities. By contrast, the outstanding amount of
Federal debt securities fell slightly ( 30.1 bil-
lion). In particular, central government re-
deemed five-year Federal notes (Bobls) worth
38.8 billion and Federal Treasury discount
paper (Bubills) to the tune of 32.8 billion.
By contrast, it predominantly issued two-year
Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) worth 37.9
billion. At the same time, ten-year Bunds,
Federal Treasury financing paper and Federal
savings notes were sold ( 31.5 billion, 30.3 bil-
lion and 30.1 billion respectively).
In the reporting month, German enterprises

14In net terms, these were all bonds with origin-
al maturities of more than one year.
On balance, debt securities were not pur-
chased by any of the investor groups in Octo-
ber. German credit institutions reduced their
exposure by 320.8 billion, the vast majority of
which constituted foreign bonds. Foreign in-
vestors sold German bonds worth 313.9 bil-
lion net. Overall, non-banks sold domestic
and foreign debt securities for 34.4 billion.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter-
prises issued 31.5 billion worth of new shares
in the German equity market, almost all of
which involved listed companies. By contrast,
the outstanding amount of foreign shares in
the German market was down significantly
by38.7 billion. Equities were purchased by
foreign investors in particular ( 31.9 billion).
German non-banks increased equity holdings
in their portfolios by 30.5 billion, whereas
German credit institutions reduced theirs by
39.6 billion.
Mutual fund shares
In October, German mutual funds recorded
significant outflows of 319.8 billion net.
Funds open to the public were the most af-
fected ( 315.2 billion), as were – to a lesser ex-
tent – the specialised funds reserved for insti-
tutional investors ( 34.6 billion). In the case of
funds open to the public, outflows were most
pronounced for shares in open-end real es-
tate funds ( 35.1 billion), followed by shares
in money market funds ( 33.9 billion), bond-based funds ( 32.8 billion), equity funds ( 31.8
billion), mixed securities-based funds ( 31.1
billion) and mixed funds ( 30.3 billion). Foreign
funds traded in the German market also suf-
fered large outflows of funds ( 319.5 billion).
Shares were primarily returned by resident
non-banks ( 331.5 billion). Net sales of mutual
fund certificates by foreign investors and Ger-
man credit institutions amounted to 34.1 bil-
lion and 33.7 billion respectively.
Balance of payments
In October, the surplus on Germany’s current
account – in unadjusted terms – fell to 315.0
billion and was thus 30.4 billion down on the
month. The reason for this was the reversal to
a negative balance in invisible current trans-
actions, which comprise services, income and
current transfers. By contrast, the trade sur-
plus went up.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in October the foreign
trade surplus increased by 31.4 billion on the
month to 316.4 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar variations, it rose by
32.1 billion to 315.8 billion. The value of im-
ports declined more significantly (-3.5%)
than that of exports (-0.5%). Compared with
the third-quarter average, nominal exports re-
mained unchanged. Imports went down by
3.8%, largely owing to the continued sharp
falls in prices for energy sources and other
commodities.
A deficit of 30.6 billion was recorded for in-
visible current transactions in October, com-Purchases of

15pared with a surplus of 31.2 billion in Sep-
tember. This turnaround was due to the in-crease (of 31.0 billion to 33.7 billion) in the
deficit on current transfers and (of 30.8 bil-
lion to 32.2 billion) in the deficit on services.
By contrast, net receipts from cross-border in-come remained at the previous month’s level(35.3 billion).
With respect to cross-border portfolio invest-
ment, October saw large net capital imports(333.6 billion compared with 38.1 billion in
September). The main reason for this wasthat German residents further reduced theirinvestments abroad by 349.7 billion, follow-
ing a decrease of 314.8 billion in the previous
month. This withdrawal of funds applied toall instruments. Foreign debt securities ac-counted for 321.0 billion; German investors
disposed of both bonds and notes ( 314.2 bil-
lion) and money market paper ( 36.8 billion)
on balance. At the same time, they sold mu-tual fund shares ( 319.5 billion) and shares
(39.2 billion). Foreign portfolio investors ac-
celerated their strategy of scaling back invest-ment in Germany (down 316.1 billion com-
pared with 36.8 billion in September). They
primarily opted out of German debt securities(313.9 billion), selling – mainly public – bonds
(317.7 billion) while investing in money mar-
ket paper ( 33.8 billion). In addition, they sold
mutual fund shares ( 34.1 billion) and ac-
quired a modest volume of shares ( 31.9 bil-
lion).
Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports of 37.9 billion in October, following in-
flows of 31.5 billion in September. This was
due largely to the fact that German enter-Major items of the balance

16prises provided their foreign affiliates with
capital worth 37.7 billion. In the main, these
funds were made available through intra-
group credit transactions ( 35.7 billion), pre-
dominantly in the form of financial loans. Fur-
thermore, foreign affiliates enjoyed a capital
increase of 32.4 billion as a result of reinvest-
ed earnings. Investment by foreign propri-
etors in their German affiliates remained vir-
tually unchanged. Modest outflows of funds
in the form of loans were offset by reinvested
earnings of much the same volume.
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (in as much
as these do not constitute a part of direct in-
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other
assets saw net capital exports in October
which matched those of the previous month
(344.7 billion). Non-banks recorded inflows
of313.3 billion. This was due predominantlyto the activities of enterprises and households
(39.8 billion) – especially through recourse to
short-term financial loans abroad and to ac-
tivities by general government which induced
inflows of funds amounting to 33.4 billion. By
contrast, the banking system recorded out-
flows of 358.0 billion which to a large extent
can be seen as a reflection of all other bal-
ance of payments transactions. A major role
here was played by capital outflows of 398.4
billion from credit institutions. Conversely, the
Bundesbank recorded inflows of 340.5 bil-
lion. A reduction in claims within the large-

17Outlook for the
German economy –
macroeconomic
projections for 2009
and 2010The outlook for the German economy
has worsened significantly following
the renewed escalation of the financial
crisis in autumn and the accompanying
further deterioration in the world
economy. A considerable decline in
real economic activity in Germany may
be expected for the winter half-year of
2008-09. The rescue actions that have
now been launched in many countries
have created a broad basis for stem-
ming the global crisis of confidence.
Nevertheless, the continuing adverse
factors going into next year are to be
rated as severe. The German economy
is not expected to pick up again until
the projected global economic upturn
in 2010. In accordance with this base-
line scenario, which is fraught with
major uncertainty, price-adjusted gross
domestic product (GDP) will decline by
0.8% in 2009 and go up by 1.2% in
2010.
Owing to price corrections for energy
and food, HICP inflation will continue
to ease initially, but will rise again
from the fourth quarter of 2009 when
base effects are no longer operative
and higher wage costs increasingly
make themselves felt given an im-
proved economic situation. According-
ly, average annual inflation rates of
0.8% and 1.4% are to be expected for
2009 and 2010 respectively.

18Current situation
There has been a marked slowdown in the
pace of economic growth in Germany since
the middle of this year in the wake of the
cooling of global economic activity. While the
decline in overall output in the second quar-
ter may be seen, to some extent, as a tech-
nical reaction to the extremely strong growth
in the first quarter, the outlook has now
deteriorated considerably both nationally and
internationally. Sentiment in major sectors of
the German economy has rapidly worsened.
In the third quarter of this year, overall output
in Germany fell in price, calendar and season-
ally adjusted terms by 0.5% on the quarter
and was no more than 0.8% up on the year
in working-day-adjusted terms. By contrast,
there has been a marked easing of the price
climate. As a result of the sharp corrections in
the international commodity markets, there
was a perceptible fall in consumer inflation,
which had peaked at a year-on-year rate of
3.5% in July.
In the third quarter, the disruptive factors
stemming from the persistent and deep dis-
locations in the international financial mar-
kets were not yet having a direct impact on
real activity in the German economy. At
present, there is no indication, at least from
the macro data, of any direct effects in the
shape of generally restrictive lending by the
banks. Fixed investment has maintained the
cyclically high level of the second quarter –
supported in some cases by well-filled order
books – and, despite the considerable strain
of losses in purchasing power, private con-
sumption benefited on average in the thirdquarter from ongoing employment growth
and the comparatively sharp rises in negoti-
ated rates of pay. The fact that real GDP was
considerably dampened in this period by the
external side was due mainly to the high level
of import activity, which was the result of a
marked increase in domestic inventories.
Moreover, exports of goods and services have
been slipping somewhat since as long ago as
the second quarter. Economic developments
in the industrial countries as well as the emer-
ging market economies and the central and
east European transition countries are now
displaying greater synchronicity again, with
the latter having experienced some abrupt
outflows of capital recently. As a result, the
German economy’s traditionally broadly
based regional sales structure is able to per-
form its usual compensating function only to
a very limited extent.
Despite the marked economic downturn, the
positive overall situation in the German la-
bour market continued up to the end of the
period under review. According to the esti-
mates of the Federal Statistical Office, there
was a further month-on-month rise in the
number of persons in work in October with
an increase of 518,000 on the year. There
was a further fall of 10,000 in the seasonally
adjusted unemployment figure to 3.15 mil-
lion in November. Employment growth in
major sectors has now come to a standstill,
however, and firms’ recruitment plans reflect
a more cautious basic attitude.
Compared with the last projection of June
this year, the basic situation has deteriorated
considerably overall. The indicators currentlyCyclical

19suggest that overall output is likely to decline
in the final quarter of the year, too.1The Ger-
man economy will therefore be going into
next year from an already depressed level and
with considerable existing strains in terms of
general sentiment. Nevertheless, domestic
capacity utilisation, which reached a cyclically
high level at the beginning of 2008, is
unlikely to be indicating a cyclical cooling at
present.
Major assumptions2
The slowdown in global expansion has been
considerably intensified by the recent shocks
to the global financial system – a slowdown
that was already marked by the corrections in
major real estate markets, high global infla-
tionary pressure since the summer of 2007,
and growing external imbalances in a number
of emerging market economies. Develop-
ments in the industrial countries played the
major part in this. Following positive growth
in the first half of the year in the United
States and the United Kingdom – countries
with large financial sectors and severely ailing
housing markets – the third quarter saw a de-
cline in overall output. Furthermore, in Japan,
the downward movement which began in
the second quarter persisted at the start of
the second half of the year. There was a per-
ceptible slowdown in economic activity in a
number of emerging market economies in
the third quarter as well, however. Year-on-
year GDP growth was noticeably weaker than
before in China, for example. In addition,
economies with sustained large current ac-
count deficits and substantial short-term ex-ternal debt, some of which is in foreign cur-
rency, proved to be especially vulnerable to
increased outflows of capital.
Developments in the first half of the year
mean that the June forecast of global growth
at 31/C252% can largely be maintained for the
current year. The outlook for the coming year
is now considerably less favourable, however.
The current projection is based on the
assumption that global economic output will
increase by no more than just under 2% in
2009 and that growth will then probably pick
up again to 31/C254% in 2010 as the global econ-Major assumptions of the projection

20omy gradually recovers. This signifies a down-
ward revision of more than 11/C252percentage
points compared with the June forecast for
2009.
Given these underlying conditions and taking
due account of the fact that demand for
internationally tradable goods reacts very
sensitively to changing cyclical conditions, the
volume of global trade – following an expan-
sion of some 41/C254% this year – could increase
by only 21/C254% in 2009 but go up by 5% again
in 2010. For German exporters’ sales markets,
this assumption implies a calendar-adjusted
expansion of 31/C252% in 2008 as well as 11/C252%
and 41/C254% respectively in 2009 and 2010.
This means that German export growth is
being revised downwards by more than 3
percentage points for 2009 compared with
the last projection; this is a direct reflection of
the considerable deterioration in the external
sales outlook.
The projection is based on the technical as-
sumption of a constant euro exchange rate
over the forecasting horizon of US$1.27. This
reflects the fact that the euro has depreciated
sharply against the US dollar since July. The
nominal effective exchange rate of the euro
against the currencies of the 22 most import-
ant euro-area trading partners during the
forecasting horizon is assumed to be 51/C252%
below its average value for 2008. This signi-
fies an improvement in the price competitive-
ness of the euro area. The interest rate as-
sumptions derived from market expectations
envisage an average level for the three-
month EURIBOR of 2.8% in 2009 and 3.2%
in 2010, compared with 4.7% this year.According to the current market assessment,
the long-term yield on German government
bonds is likely to fall slightly initially next year
from 4.0% to 3.8%. For 2010, a further rise
to an average of 4.1% is expected.
As in the June projection, due account was
taken of the impact of the financial market
crisis on the cost of enterprises’ debt
financing owing to additional interest rate
premiums on loans to enterprises. The pre-
miums are significantly larger again than in
the June projection. This takes account, not
least, of the fact that spreads on corporate
bonds still rated as investment grade (BBB)
shot up suddenly in September, reaching new
highs in October.
The spot price for crude oil has more than
halved from its peak of almost US$147 per
barrel (Brent) in July of this year. The forward
prices for the next few months indicate the
expectation of a countermovement. Accord-
ingly, the projection is based on the assump-
tion of an average annual oil price of
US$67.3 in 2009 and US$76.6 in 2010.
Given the exchange rate assumption, this
means that, next year, the price of crude oil in
euro terms is likely to be more than one-fifth
below its average level for 2008. Compared
with the June projection, the price assump-
tions for a barrel of crude oil have been re-
vised downwards by US$46 for 2009 and
more than US$40 for 2010. In the case of
other commodities (excluding energy), the
market players currently expect a price reduc-
tion of almost one-fifth for 2009 on an
annual average. A rise of just under 6% is
assumed for the following year.Global trade

21In public finances, all measures were taken
into consideration which have either been
adopted or which have already been specified
in sufficient detail and are likely to be ap-
proved. In particular, the adjustments to the
contribution rate of the Federal Employment
Agency (3.3% in 2008, 2.8% from January
2009 to June 2010, and 3.0% thereafter) as
well as the increase in the contribution rate to
the statutory health insurance scheme with
the introduction of the health insurance fund
in 2009 (to 15.5%) have been included. Of
chief significance among the fiscal measures
are the recently agreed package of measures
with the aim of bolstering the economy and
the planned increase in income tax allow-
ances for contributions to the health and
long-term care insurance schemes from
2010. There will be a greater burden on the
expenditure side resulting, in particular, from
higher child benefit payments, increased
healthcare spending owing to new arrange-
ments for the remuneration of outpatient
treatment and hospital financing, as well as
the suspension of the “Riester factor” in the
adjustment of pension payments. The ending
of the grant to homebuyers will provide relief,
however. These calculations are also based on
a relatively sharp rise in government invest-
ment. Government support measures for
financial institutions have been taken into ac-
count to a minor extent for 2008 as increas-
ing the deficit.
Cyclical outlook
The marked changes in the underlying condi-
tions, which have been incorporated into theassumptions, call for a significant revision of
the baseline projection. Taken in isolation, a
lower euro exchange rate, the sharp decline
in the cost of oil, and the easing price pres-
sure in the case of food are to be rated as
positive factors for the economy as a whole.
To a large extent, however, this development
reflects the massive cooling of the global
economy, which is also reflected in a sharp
downward revision of German exporters’
sales market growth. The German economy’s
historically high degree of openness, which is
now over 85% of GDP , and its pattern of
specialisation in the international division of
labour mean that it is particularly influenced
by changes in external conditions. It may be
assumed that this dampening effect will
clearly predominate. Moreover, negative con-
fidence effects as well as gloomier sales
prospects are likely to induce households and
enterprises to be generally more cautious in
their spending, even though there are few
signs of credit supply constraints in Germany
so far.
Domestic final demand and the strong build-
up of inventories were still countering the
waning external impulses in the third quarter.
This stabilising influence is likely to be weaker
in the final quarter of this year, however. The
persistent decline in the volume of industrial
orders, which was illustrated recently by
some large firms announcing that they would
be closing some production locations tempor-
arily, is likely to reinforce the decline in indus-
trial output. This development could eventu-
ally have an impact on business-related ser-
vices and the transport and logistics sector.

22macroeconomic activity may be expected for
the final quarter of 2008. This would place
the German economy in a very difficult pos-
ition starting out in the new year.
In line with the assumptions about the global
economic setting, the baseline projection as-
sumes that the cyclical slowdown in Germany
will persist in 2009 but that there will be no
further major cutbacks in production duringthe course of the year. Growth in the German
economy is likely to return slowly to its poten-
tial only in the wake of a global economic up-
turn in 2010. Following a calendar-adjusted
average annual increase of 1.3% in real GDP
this year, overall output in 2009 could there-
fore fall by 0.8% on an annual average be-
fore an expected increase of 1.1% in 2010. In
calendar-adjusted terms, this corresponds to
rates of change of 1.6% for 2008, -0.8% for
2009, and 1.2% in 2010. The underlying flat
trend in GDP over the four quarters of 2009
reflects the weakness of several demand
components. The adverse external conditions
will have an increased impact on investment.
Private consumption is unlikely to provide any
significant stimulus. Accordingly, there will be
a marked fall in overall capacity utilisation. As
a result, the German economy will experience
a period of cyclical underutilisation in 2009
and 2010. In comparison with earlier cyclical
downturns, the output gap up to the end of
the forecasting horizon is not rated as excep-
tionally large, however.
The continuing fall in export orders since the
beginning of the year was reflected in declin-
ing export business in the third quarter of
2008. The retarding effect stemming from
world trade generally is likely to be reinforced
by the profile of Germany’s export goods.
Owing to the major importance of capital
goods, German exporters have been hit espe-
cially hard by the deterioration in the invest-
ment climate globally. While this range of
goods largely shielded German exporters

23prove to be particularly vulnerable to the
worldwide economic slowdown.
Against this background, it may be assumed
that, next year, German exporters will relin-quish some of the market shares gained earl-ier. Overall, exports of goods and servicescould decline by
1/C252% in price-adjusted terms,
compared with growth of 41/C252% in 2008. In
2010, German exports are likely to grow inline with the sales markets as the world econ-omy recovers. Imports will rise this year by ap-proximately 4
3/C254% in real terms. As a result,
the external sector will, on an annual aver-age, still make a slightly positive contributionto growth. Given an expected increase in realimports of
1/C252% in 2009 and 43/C254% in 2010,
the baseline projection shows the externalsector exerting a dampening impact on over-all economic output next year before possiblymaking a positive contribution to GDPgrowth again in 2010.
The gloomier sales prospects for German
enterprises and a recent considerable drop incapacity utilisation will put a noticeabledamper on domestic investment activity.However, the higher cost of debt financing,as far as it concerns investment, is unlikely tohave a major impact owing to the low de-mand for external financing. Moreover, non-financial enterprises’ balance-sheet structuresremain in a sound condition. There are indica-tions of significant excess capacity only insome sectors. While fixed investment is likelyto have risen again by 4
1/C252% this year, a
decline of 3% is expected for 2009. Thestrongly cyclical spending on machinery andequipment, in particular, will have a negativeimpact on the overall result. Investment’s con-
tribution to growth is likely to remain largelyneutral overall in 2010.
Developments in construction investment
look set to be mixed. Not least because of ac-celerated investment in transport infrastruc-ture, public sector construction is likely toprovide some stimulus to the economy as awhole. Housing construction, by contrast, islikely to support growth only marginally dur-ing the forecasting horizon, with expectedweak new construction activity possibly beingcompensated for by – in some cases, govern-ment-subsidised – activity in the finishingtrades.

tion again failed to materialise this year.Technical components of the GDP

24Income growth as a result of the improved
labour market situation and a fairly substan-
tial rise in wages was largely eroded by un-
favourable price developments. Price sticki-
ness means that there will be a certain time
lag before the marked decline in the price of
oil from the third quarter onwards and the
corrections to the prices of agricultural prod-
ucts fully work their way through to con-
sumer prices. The substantial fall in prices in
the international stock markets have, more-
over, resulted in considerable asset losses and
are likely to limit the scope for expenditure on
this front. However, the percentage of equi-
ties in households’ total assets is small and
spread rather unevenly.
What appears more important is the fact that
the precautionary motive is becoming more
prevalent again given the growing uncer-
tainty about the future income situation.
Households’ savings ratio may therefore be
expected to go on rising, namely from 111/C252%
this year to 12% next year, despite the un-
favourable return on financial assets. Given
the gloomier economic outlook, this level is
likely to be largely maintained over the fore-
casting horizon. This means that the project-
ed improvement in real incomes is initially
hardly likely to be reflected in higher private
consumption. Having declined by1/C252% this
year, private consumption will probably tend
to stagnate with a flat profile over the four
quarters of 2009 and not contribute percep-
tibly to growth until 2010 with a rise of
11/C254%.
The labour market could have a stabilising
effect in the current downturn, at least in thenear future. Although employment generally
reacts quite strongly – albeit with a time lag –
to an economic slowdown, enterprises’ plans
do not yet appear to envisage any adjust-
ments, at least not in terms of core staff. In-
stead, there are initially to be reductions in
overtime and working hours accounts. In
addition, some enterprises are planning to
cut regular working hours. Ultimately, it may
be assumed that a lot of companies will make
use of short-time working benefits, which
were recently extended from 12 to 18
months. Nevertheless, there could soon be
severe cutbacks in temporary work, which
has accounted for a considerable part of em-
ployment growth in recent years. Unlike be-
fore, temporary work agencies can now also
apply for short-time working benefits, how-
ever. Overall, it may be assumed that the
total number of hours worked will be adjust-
ed to demand to a considerable extent via
the time component initially.
Assuming overall economic activity develops
as projected and hourly productivity increases
by just3/C254% in 2009 and just over 1% in
2010, total hours worked could drop by
11/C252% next year and remain roughly un-
changed in 2010. As much as two-thirds of
the adjustment will probably be effected via
the working time component in 2009. This
means that employment would shrink by just
1/C252%. Over the course of the year, however,
the buffer effect of the working time com-
ponent will decline, with the result that the
number of persons in work is likely to be
roughly 1% down on the year in the final
quarter of 2009. In 2010, average working
hours could continue to return to a normalConfidence and

25pattern against the backdrop of the expected
upturn in overall economic activity. The num-
ber of employed persons would then decline
by1/C252% on an annual average.
The official unemployment figure is likely to
rise by an annual average of more than
100,000 in 2009 and 2010 with a slight de-
cline in the supply of labour. According to the
Federal Employment Agency’s definition, this
is equivalent to an unemployment rate of
8.1% and 8.5% respectively in 2009 and
2010, compared with 7.8% this year.
Labour costs and price outlook
Since the June projection, wage agreements
of importance for the economy as a whole
have been concluded in the retail sector
(delayed by one year) and in the metal-
working and electrical engineering industries
(effective into 2010). These agreements were
largely in line with expectations. Negotiations
in the private banking sector have not yet
produced an agreement, which means that
the rates of pay agreed in earlier rounds of
wage negotiations will continue to apply for
the time being in this industry. Overall, nego-
tiated rates of pay are likely to rise significant-
ly more rapidly in 2008 (23/C254%) than in the
previous year (+11/C252%). The rate of increase,
which is largely determined by existing agree-
ments, could likewise amount to 23/C254%i n
2009. The pace is subsequently likely to
weaken again somewhat in 2010 in response
to the change in macroeconomic conditions
(+21/C254%).Key results of the macroeconomic

26Nevertheless, the increase in actual earnings
per employee of 21/C254% will fall well short of
the rise in negotiated rates of pay next year.
For one thing, the gloomier macroeconomic
situation is likely to mean that escape clauses
are used more frequently. For another, enter-
prises will cut back working hours and intro-
duce more short-time working. In 2010, a
return to normal may be expected in this
area, with the wage drift (on a monthly basis)
possibly being neutral again as a result. While
the sharp reduction in unemployment insur-
ance contributions is lowering labour costs
this year, the further reduction scheduled for
2009 will virtually be offset by higher contri-
butions to the statutory health insurance
scheme. This means that the average com-
pensation per employee will rise somewhat
more strongly than in 2008 despite
a pronounced negative wage drift. In 2010,
labour costs will continue to rise significantly.
As the working time component is strongly
negative, productivity per person employed
will decline somewhat in 2009. Unit labour
costs could therefore even undergo some-
what stronger growth, at 21/C252%, than in
2008. The rate of increase is not likely to ease
significantly until 2010. In view of the un-
favourable economic setting, enterprises are,
however, likely to have difficulties in fully
passing on the higher costs to consumers. In
fact, margins are likely to narrow in 2009 –
even more so than in 2008. This will be slight-
ly offset by the lower cost of imported com-
modities. In addition, the earnings situation
had improved sharply in the years before.
Prices could somewhat outpace unit labour
costs again in 2010.The decline in consumer price inflation that
set in during the third quarter of 2008 will
probably continue well into 2009 despite the
depreciation of the euro. This is partly the re-
sult of price corrections for energy and food
triggered by developments in the internation-
al commodities markets. Moreover, the steep
rise in prices into the third quarter of 2008
has produced base effects that will increas-
ingly compress the year-on-year rise in con-
sumer prices in the following year. The annual
rate of HICP inflation could drop to less than
1/C252% around the middle of 2009, or even be-
come negative. However, the medium-term
price trend – as measured by annualised, sea-
sonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter changes
– will be in excess of 1% in the second half of
2009 and in 2010. Deflationary effects can
therefore be ruled out as far as it is possible
to tell at present.
From the fourth quarter of 2009 onwards,
the annual rate of HICP inflation will increase
again when the base effects cease to be op-
erative. Furthermore, energy and food, in line
with the assumptions, will become somewhat
more expensive again. As the economic situ-
ation improves, the accelerated rise in wage
costs is likely to make itself increasingly felt.
As a result, inflation could be 11/C252% at the
end of the forecasting horizon in the final
quarter of 2010. Averaged over the year, con-
sumer prices will probably rise by 2.8% in
2008. The difference of 0.2 percentage point
compared with the June projection can be ex-
plained by the unexpected, sharp correction
of crude oil prices from the middle of 2008
onwards. Differences are greater with regard
to 2009, for which an inflation rate of 2.2%Higher actual

27was expected in the last projection. The cur-
rent assessment is that the average rate of
price increase could be less than 1%. Again,
most of the projection revision is due to the
changed outlook for energy prices. However,
falling food prices since the autumn of 2008
are also curbing inflation. As a result, HICP in-
flation excluding energy is expected to rise by
just 1.3% in 2009, compared with the earlier
expectation of 1.6%. For 2010, consumer
prices overall might increase by 1.4% based
on current assumptions.
Public finances3
The general government budget is likely to
close the year slightly in surplus in 2008, after
already being almost balanced in 2007.
A strong first quarter means that macroeco-
nomic developments have also made a small
contribution to this improvement. A moder-
ate overall increase in expenditure, the on-
going positive underlying trend in terms of
profit-related taxes and higher tax receipts as
a result of tax progression effects are further
factors. This more than offsets budgetary
strains, particularly as a result of the business
tax reform and the net reduction in social
contribution rates.
The macroeconomic environment and the
revenues from the very volatile profit-related
taxes represent considerable risks for further
budgetary developments. Moreover, the im-
pact of government aid to stabilise the bank-
ing system is particularly uncertain – not least
in terms of statistical measurement.4According to the current forecast, public
finances will deteriorate perceptibly in 2009,
with a deficit of almost 1% of GDP being
likely. This can be attributed, for one thing, to
the economic slowdown, though the de-
mand and distribution structure is particularly
favourable from a public finances perspective.
For another, profit-related taxes are expected
to decline noticeably from the extremely high
level they reached in 2008.Price projection *

28The revenue ratio could remain virtually
unchanged as the declining trend in profit-
related taxes will be offset by higher revenue
resulting from faster growth in gross wages
and salaries vis-/C224-vis GDP , the effects of in-
come tax progression, and a restructuring of
EU funding. On balance, legislative changes
will play no role. By contrast, the expenditure
ratio should rise significantly. The unfavour-
able course of economic development will liftthe ratio both as a result of rising cyclical
labour market expenditure and lower GDP
growth in the denominator. On top of this,
healthcare spending, in particular, will in-
crease relatively sharply, as will investment.
Based on the legislative status quo , the deficit
ratio should increase markedly again in 2010,
moving towards 2%. As things currently
stand, cyclical influences will remain negative.
Furthermore, plans to increase income tax al-
lowances for contributions to the health and
long-term care insurance schemes as well as
larger revenue losses as a result of the recent-
ly concluded package of measures to stimu-
late the economy will result in perceptible tax
shortfalls. In addition, profit-related taxes
might well continue to develop poorly. The
general government debt ratio, which had
fallen significantly to 65% in 2007, might in-
crease again in the reporting period.
Risk assessment
Macroeconomic forecasts are currently
fraught with extremely high uncertainty in
terms of the world economy. This is particu-
larly true of mutual dependencies between
the real economy and the financial sector. Nu-
merous countries have now rapidly adopted
large-scale rescue measures to avoid systemic
risks. Additionally, central banks have sharply
expanded their liquidity operations and cut
their interest rates. Furthermore, a number of
governments have launched economic stimu-
lus packages.Baseline and uncertainty

29The impact of all these support measures on
the real economy can be measured only par-tially. The hypothesis underlying the baselineprojection is, firstly, that the situation in thefinancial markets will gradually ease and sta-bilise and, secondly, that, following subduedgrowth in 2009, the global economy will startto pick up again in 2010, partly as a result ofthe significantly expansionary macro policies.However, a time profile where the economicslump is significantly sharper in the shortterm, perhaps followed by a more rapid re-covery from a lower level is by no means in-conceivable. Nevertheless, the downturn inthe global – and therefore also the German –economy might also persist for a noticeablylonger period of time, especially as an endo-genously sustained recovery of the globaleconomy is unlikely to take place until thereal estate markets in major industrial coun-tries have consolidated and progress hasbeen made on recapitalising and restructur-ing the international financial system. All of
this suggests taking a fairly cautious view ofthe potential for a recovery during the fore-casting horizon.
The timeline in terms of cost and price devel-
opments also hinges crucially on the assump-tion that a recovery of the global economywill follow an economic downturn that ishard but still of limited duration. In this base-line scenario, the short-term price risks areprobably more on the downside should thedownward pressure on the real economyprove to be stronger than previously expect-ed. If, by contrast, the economic downturncontinues for a lengthy period, the rate ofprice increase could be weaker from thefourth quarter of 2009 onwards. First, therewould be the expectation of lower price risesfrom the external side. Second, wage growthwithin Germany, and thus the domestic costcomponent, would probably be weaker.

31The euro ten years
on – the German
economy in monetary
unionThe history-making introduction of the
euro on 1 January 1999 engendered
hope in many and scepticism in some.
Ten years on, it is now time to take
stock. The economic advantages ex-
pected of the single currency have
been largely achieved. The euro area
has experienced a period of remark-
able monetary stability. Events have
confirmed the need to back up the sin-
gle monetary policy with a set of fiscal
policy rules. Although the binding ef-
fect of the Stability and Growth Pact
(SGP) has been weakened over the
past few years, its existence still facili-
tates the implementation of necessary
consolidation measures in the euro
area, including Germany. In the early
years of monetary union, the German
economy underwent a difficult adjust-
ment process. The only way to address
the massive structural problems beset-
ting the labour market was through a
lengthy phase of moderate wage
growth and radical reforms. In the past
few years, however, the structural re-
silience of the German economy has
been renewed. In the current reces-
sionary global economic environment,
the challenges facing the single cur-
rency are no less significant than those
at the beginning of monetary union.
Strengthening the pillars of European
unification and developing a European
culture of stability remain the main
goals.

32The euro ten years on:
expectations and preliminary report
The introduction of the euro on 1 January
1999 was greeted with the hope that it
would give a new boost to competition,
make prices more transparent and thereby
promote the convergence of prices within the
euro area. It was also hoped that the elimin-
ation of exchange rate risks and the reduction
of transaction costs would be a catalyst for
economic integration in the goods and finan-
cial markets alike and that the importance of
monetary policy disruptions – which had
been a recurring feature of earlier decades –
would sharply diminish. Of particular signifi-
cance, however, was the hope that the single
monetary policy of the Eurosystem – backed
by fiscal policy through the SGP – would en-
sure price stability for the over 290 million
residents of the original 11-member currency
zone. Ten years on, this area has grown into
a 15-member region with a population of
320 million.
Now that monetary union is ten years old,
preliminary conclusions may be drawn even if
the period is too short for a comprehensive
assessment. During this period, however, the
euro-area economy, like the German econ-
omy, has virtually completed a business cycle,
which minimises the risk that a macroeco-
nomic assessment of the entire period will
amalgamate cyclical developments with
structural developments.
On the whole, the realistic expectations re-
garding the advantages of monetary union
have been largely fulfilled. The forecasts ofgloom and doom proved to be unfounded,
while excessive optimism was dashed. The
sceptics who predicted a short life for the
euro were proved wrong; however, those
who thought the single currency would be a
catalyst for structural reforms were disap-
pointed, too.
The promise of stability that came with mon-
etary union was of key importance not least
to the general public here in Germany, where
the advantages of a stability-oriented monet-
ary policy had already been achieved well be-
fore monetary union. Against that backdrop,
it is positive to note that the past ten years
have represented a period of considerable
monetary stability, by international and his-
torical standards alike, for both the euro area
and Germany. While Germany saw continuity
in its stability policy, some of the other euro-
area countries got the chance to participate
in the advantages of a climate of price stabil-
ity. With an average annual (HICP) inflation
rate of just over 2%, the euro area largely
achieved its avowed medium-term objective
of below but close to 2%. However, numer-
ous external price drivers, such as the dramat-
ic increase in energy and commodity prices
up until mid-2008, which cannot be influ-
enced by domestic policymakers, were the
main reasons why the target was slightly
missed. All in all, in its first ten years, monet-
ary union has succeeded in solidifying a
Europe-wide culture of stability on a new
foundation, with the single currency making
a decisive contribution.

33euro area with a framework of fiscal policy
rules. In the first half of this period, it wasparticularly fiscal problems in Germany andFrance that subjected the SGP to a severestress test. This led to amendments to theSGP in 2005. Although the basis of the rulesremained the same, their specific shape wasmade more flexible, more complicated andless transparent. This, along with the intro-duction of numerous exemptions, weakenedthe binding nature of the SGP . However, evenafter the amendments had been adopted,some member states either hardly compliedwith the “preventive sections” of the rules ordid so only very grudgingly.
On the whole, however, developments in
public sector budgets did not stand in theway of a stability-oriented monetary policy.The especially highly indebted nations re-duced their deficit ratios – albeit, in somecases, very slowly. The agreed upper deficitlimit of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP)was exceeded on several occasions; however,owing to the correction mechanisms builtinto the deficit procedures, most of these mis-alignments were successfully remedied withina reasonable timeframe. Over the past year,the deficit ratio was below the 3% mark in al-most all euro-area countries – although itmust be said that this took place in a macro-economic environment that was still favour-able. However, the strong economic head-wind which the euro area has been facingsince the third quarter and the high risks as-sociated with the financial crisis will pose newshort and medium-term challenges to the fis-cal framework.The main achievement of the single currency
has been to promote the convergence of themoney and capital markets. Growing compe-tition, increasingly liquid and transparentmarkets, and economies of scale and scopehave all demonstrably improved risk diversifi-cation and enhanced the efficiency of capitalallocation.

34ally identical3throughout the euro area, yield
spreads between different nations’ govern-
ment bonds still exist; over the past ten years,
these spreads have been caused largely by li-
quidity differentials and also by “home bias”,
ie investors’ preference to invest in domestic
instruments. This bias, however, seems to
have diminished perceptibly in monetary
union, for bonds and stocks alike.4The sharp
growth in yield spreads between member
states’ government bonds owing to the fi-
nancial crisis, however, has made it clear that
the risks engendered by the public finance
situation in individual countries have not
completely disappeared from investors’ calcu-
lations.
In line with preliminary expectations, the
introduction of the euro gave a boost to pricetransparency, with nearly nine out of ten
euro-area citizens confirming, just a few years
after the establishment of the euro area, that
the single currency had made it easier to
compare prices between member states.5By
contrast, slightly less than one-third of those
surveyed believed that the euro had reduced
price differences between member states.6
This sceptical view is also reflected by the
relatively divergent results of empirical stud-
ies, which show that, even as early as the be-
ginning of the 1990s, there had been signifi-
cant price convergence in Europe.7However,
what they also illustrate is the absence to

35whether the introduction of the euro has led
to price convergence.8
By contrast, ten years of monetary unionhave shown that falling transaction costs andthe elimination of exchange rate risks haveper se had a positive impact on euro-area for-
eign trade. Intra-euro-area exports and im-ports rose from 28% of euro-area GDP in1999 to 33% in 2007. Growth in intra-euro-area trade, however, did not detrimentally af-fect the growth in trade with the rest of theworld. This is suggested by the fact that euro-area countries’ trade with the rest of theworld grew even more strongly than intra-euro-area trade. To that extent, the “trade di-version”
9effect feared by some did not ma-
terialise; instead, the increased competitivepressure caused by the intensification ofintra-euro-area trade is likely, in a highly dy-namic global economic environment, to havehad more of a positive impact on the euroarea’s competitiveness in world markets. Em-pirical studies indicate that the euro couldhave made a contribution to the growth oftrading volume in the euro area amounting toaround 3% to 5% and that these positivetrade effects have been concentrated particu-larly on sectors with highly differentiatedproducts.

Prior to the launch of monetary union, weak-dollar periods, such as the time of the US dol-lar’s plunge in the second half of the 1980s orthe Mexican crisis in the mid-1990s, frequent-ly coincided with unilateral portfolio shifts infavour of the Deutsche Mark. The appreci-ation of the Deutsche Mark that this causedled to tensions within the European MonetarySystem (EMS) and to a – sometimes substan-
tial – decline in the price competitiveness ofthe German economy, including Germany’sbilateral trade with its European partners.European monetary union eliminated suchintra-European exchange rate shifts, with theresult that the attendant real adjustmentstrains of the past are now no longer anissue. This protective umbrella has benefited,in particular, the heavily export-reliant Ger-man economy. In the past few months, too,this umbrella is likely to have had a stabilisingimpact given the sharp rise in volatility in theinternational forex markets and the sharp in-

36crease in yield spreads between different
countries’ government bonds, both of which
were associated with the financial market cri-
sis.
By contrast, the hopes held at the inception
of monetary union that the euro could serve
as a sort of catalyst in triggering structural re-
forms in the real sector of euro-area countries
have been fulfilled only marginally or not at
all. There are certainly no signs that the euro
area has made any more progress in this re-
spect over the past few years than, for in-
stance, the non-euro-area EU countries (ex-
cluding the accession countries). Although
employment in the euro area has developed
favourably, rising in the past decade by
around 18 million persons and accompanied
by a visible decline in unemployment, the per
capita income gap relative to the USA since
the start of monetary union has not nar-
rowed perceptibly; indeed, labour productiv-
ity growth over the past decade is actually
much lower than in the preceding ten-year
period. Average overall economic growth in
the euro area over the past ten years, at
somewhat more than 2% per year, has like-
wise stagnated.
This clearly shows that it remains incumbent
upon the euro-area national governments
and the European Commission to press
ahead with the process of reform in the Euro-
pean Union along the standards set in Lisbon
in 2000 and reaffirmed in 2005. It has be-
come clear in the ten years of monetary
union that the elimination of competition
among currencies in Europe and of the asso-
ciated risk premium “penalty” has not less-ened the need for reform. On the contrary –
and this is particularly relevant with respect to
the German economy – the single currency
will not simply resolve persistent domestic
structural problems automatically. National
targeted reform measures are still necessary
to remedy these problems.
German economy in its first decade
of monetary union
The beginning of Stage Three of monetary
union on 1 January 1999 saw the German
economy in a difficult situation. This was
caused mainly by domestic misalignments
and structural weaknesses which, to a consid-
erable extent, were associated with the eco-
nomic distortions triggered by reunification
and which caused a prolonged weakness in
economic growth. Also, the situation was vis-
ibly exacerbated in the first half of the 1990s
by a perceptible appreciation of the Deutsche
Mark in the EMS as well as the depreciation
of currencies that had exited the exchange
rate mechanism (ERM) in the EMS.
Enterprises in Germany had already begun to
increase their efforts to improve their price
competitiveness by the mid-1990s. As a re-
sult, Germany’s economic problems were less
pronounced at the time of the introduction of
the euro than in the preceding period.11At
the same time, the existing need for reform
was concealed at the end of the 1990s by the

37cyclical peak following the boom of the
“New Economy”. When the global economystarted to slide following the end of theboom, however, the negative cyclical environ-ment and the unresolved structural problemscumulated, forcing the German economyinto a protracted adjustment process. The re-sultant stubborn phase of stunted growth didnot end until the middle of the current dec-ade. In a dynamic global economic environ-ment, the German economy subsequentlyreaped some of the dividends – especiallystrong employment growth – of its earlierstructural reform measures.
From the inception of monetary union until
2008, German economic growth, at an an-nual average of around 1
1/C252%, was consider-
ably slower than that of the rest of the euroarea (+2
1/C254%). Consequently, the ratio of Ger-
man GDP to overall economic output in the15-member euro area fell from 31
1/C254%i n
1999 to an estimated 27% in 2008. How-ever, the relative wealth – expressed as percapita GDP in purchasing power standardswithin the euro area – did not decline to thesame extent, as population growth in Ger-many virtually stood still while it amounted to
3/C254% per year in the rest of the euro area. In
2007, Germany was seventh in terms of percapita income; in 1999, it had been fifth. Atlast report, however, it still slightly exceededthe euro-area average.
Monetary union has changed the framework
within which economic adjustment processescan take place, with short-term nominalinterest rates now nearly identical in all euro-area member states. Although differences inlong-term nominal interest rates may con-
tinue to exist on account of risk premiumsand other factors, it is in this area, too, thatthe single currency has visibly levelled previ-ously existing yield spreads following theelimination of the premium for exchange raterisk.

38price change then cause real interest rates to
diverge. Owing to the relatively moderate in-
flation in Germany, the ex post real interest
rate (calculated on the basis of domestic con-
sumer prices) stood, at times, visibly higher
than in the rest of the euro area following the
start of Stage Three of monetary union at the
beginning of 1999. Real interest rate differen-
tials – especially concerning the longer-term
maturity spectrum – can per se have a damp-
ening impact on the economic activity of
those countries which, owing to below-
average inflation, have relatively high real
interest rates, as was the case in Germany.
However, these dampening effects are offset
by improvements in the competitive position
within the euro area owing to the rather low
rate of price increase in Germany relative to
that of most of its euro-area partners.Over time, a given inflation differential, if
nominal interest rates remain identical, will
imply merely a constant real interest rate dif-
ferential, whereas price competitiveness –
which is determined by differences in the
price levels of the affected countries – will
continuously rise in the country with the low-
est rate of inflation. Under those circum-
stances, the effects of improved competitive-
ness will gain in force over time if inflation
differentials persist.
In this context, however, there are a few sig-
nificant caveats to be observed. Longer-term
inflation expectations, which are less diver-
gent within the euro area than actual infla-
tion rates, are primarily the decisive factor for
market players’ plans. In addition, for inter-
nationally active firms, it is procurement costsChange in price competitiveness relative to the euro-area partners

39and sales prices in their relevant markets that
are the decisive factor, not national price de-velopments. Lastly, differences in real interestrates and diverging price competitivenesstrigger adjustment processes in the affectedeconomies, causing the original inflation dif-ferentials to diminish in significance overtime. Therefore, the net impact on overalleconomic growth caused by the countervail-ing movements in the real interest channeland competition channel hinges decisively onthe strength of the opening impulse, the eco-nomic structures and the underlying timehorizon. Econometric estimates for Germanysupport the thesis that, in the medium term,the competitiveness effect dominates.
This is borne out by the actual pattern of the
German economy in the past decade. Lowerinflation rates boosted German exports to itseuro-area neighbours via the competitionchannel, consolidating the domestic sellers’position in the German market. The indicatorof price competitiveness against euro-areapartners improved by 12
1/C254% from the begin-
ning of 1999 to the third quarter of 2008;since bottoming out in the second quarter of1995, the indicator has actually gone up by20
1/C254%.13
Against this background, real exports ofgoods and services to the euro area went upby 56
3/C254% from the beginning of Stage Three
of monetary union until 2005 and made aconsiderable contribution – 6

points – to German GDP growth.14This con-
trasted with a 273/C254% increase in imports
from the euro area, which results in a contri-bution by net exports of 3

402008 period,15however, German imports of
goods and services from the rest of the euro
area accelerated even further and, at 221/C254%,
slightly outpaced exports. This was mainly be-
cause Germany, after adjusting successfully,
has increasingly also had a stimulating effect
on the rest of the euro area in the past few
years. Another important factor in this con-
text is that the production of export goods,
which has grown particularly dynamically,consumes a relatively large share of imported
goods, and this share was rising up until the
end of the reporting period.16
The improved competitive position has pri-
marily been a result of wage moderation. On
average over the first ten years of the euro,
negotiated pay rose at a much slower pace,
at just under 2%, than in the 1991-1998
period.17Wage settlements were also much
higher in the 1981-1991 period. In addition,
in recent years the wage bargainers have
been increasingly agreeing opening clauses
and making working hours more flexible.18
Wage moderation was indispensable in order
to counteract misaligned labour costs in Ger-
many and thereby improve the conditions for
sustained growth and higher employment.
However, it has per se reduced domestic de-
mand. The improved competitiveness turned
out to be a macroeconomic stabiliser in this
context.
The reduction in cost pressures resulting from
wage restraint also caused productivity
growth to slow down; however, this slow-
down was not as pronounced as that of
wage growth. As a result, unit labour costs
have risen at a considerably slower rate over
the past ten years than in the 1991-1998Unit labour costs and their

0.3%, was also relatively slower than in theother euro-area countries. However, the de-flator of value added, at just under 0.6%per year, rose faster than unit labour costs.
19
Accordingly, in the first ten years of monetaryunion, prices in Germany have risen moresharply than would have been consistentwith domestic costs. A sustained improve-ment in firms’ profitability was the result; aslate as the first half of the 1990s, these enter-prises had still been labouring under the bur-den of high wage increases and the appreci-ation of the Deutsche Mark. Together withthe labour market reforms in the past fewyears, this has led to a respectable decline inunemployment.
At the same time, wage moderation has also
perceptibly tempered consumer price infla-tion and has contributed to a decade of vir-tual price stability in Germany. On the whole,consumer price inflation as measured by theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)has averaged 1.7% per year over the past tenyears, well below that of the other euro-areacountries (+2.4%). The differences in the firsthalf of the reporting period cited here wereparticularly pronounced. Wage moderation inGermany was therefore largely the reasonwhy euro-area inflation, at an average of2.2%, was not far above the Eurosystem’sdefinition of price stability. It was only in2007 that consumer prices in Germany rosefaster than in its euro-area partner countries,Main components of HICP in

42and this was the result of the increase in the
standard rate of VAT from 16% to 19%.20
Of the main HICP components, only energy
has seen a higher-than-average rate of price
increase for Germany compared with the
euro area over the past ten years. This is prob-
ably connected in large part to increases in
taxes in this area. On the other hand, German
price trends for food were more muted than
in other euro-area countries. The price shocks
resulting from the shorter supplies of and de-
mand shifts for meat and dairy products
caused by animal epidemics in 2001 and
from the increase in the prices of a broad bas-
ket of food products emanating from the
world markets from mid-2006 onwards had a
similarly strong impact in Germany, if not
even stronger, than in its partner countries.
For services, Germany’s stability advantage
was greater than for industrial goods, since
the higher labour cost share caused the
weaker domestic wage growth to have a
much more pronounced effect.
The at times particularly low inflation rates in
the first half of the past decade led to fears
that Germany was on its way to a period of
deflation.21In actual fact, price inflation in
the case of industrial goods and services,
components which are determined to a
major degree by domestic cost factors, grew
quite moderately at an average of 0.7%,
with only the less favourable price trends for
food and energy lifting the overall rate to an
annual average of 1.0%. However, Germany
was still far removed from a decline in the
general price level. In addition, in the same
year, prices in Germany’s euro-area partnersrose by an average of 2.5% (2.2% excluding
energy and food). This shows that the low in-
flation rate in Germany was less a response to
deflationary tendencies in the currency area
as a whole and more a reaction by prices to
the adjustments needed to resolve the do-
mestic structural problems – especially in the
labour market.
The introduction of euro banknotes and coins
in January 2002 did not leave a deep mark in
the official inflation rate but certainly did so
in many consumers’ perception of prices.
Germany was no different in this respect than
most of its partners.22Consumers’ percep-
tion, which was detrimentally affected for a
time in early 2002, is likely to have deterior-
ated further owing to a series of sharp price
increases, which received unduly significant
media attention. By contrast, the many small
price cuts went virtually unnoticed. Lastly, the

43terns are likely to have confused many con-
sumers. Whatever the case, it took until 2004
for consumers’ price perceptions to return to
normal.
One conclusion that can be drawn from the
lengthy and arduous adjustment process in
Germany since the mid-1990s is that, in a
monetary union, national misalignments in la-
bour costs are difficult to correct ex post with-
out sufficient downward wage flexibility and
can only be remedied gradually, if at all. The
other is that, under the rules of the game in
monetary union, there are no effective, sus-
tainable and at the same time market-based
economic policy alternatives to the path em-
barked upon here in Germany. To that extent,
Germany’s experience is suited to serve as a
model for other euro-area countries confront-
ed by the problem of diminishing price com-
petitiveness. This confirms one of the central
findings already articulated in the run-up to
monetary union: that, under the rules of the
game of a common monetary policy, labour
market flexibility is a key factor not only for
strengthening domestic growth stimuli but
also in adjusting smoothly to economic
shocks in a single monetary area.
Now, at the end of the first decade of monet-
ary union, the Germany economy – like the
single currency area as a whole – once again
faces serious economic burdens, the extent
of which, owing to the global nature of the
downturn and the additional strains caused
by the financial market crisis, should be as-
sessed as being more serious than the slow-
down at the beginning of the decade. The
current recessionary tendencies in the globaleconomy are having a disproportionately se-
vere impact on the German economy owing
to the sharp increase in its openness and its
specialisation patterns in the international
division of labour, patterns which are particu-
larly well reflected in the high importance
given to its exports of capital goods. Its start-
ing position, however, is better than at the
beginning of the decade since, at present,
cyclical strains and uncompleted structural
homework are not overlapping and mutually
reinforcing one another to the same degree.

44Deuts che Bun desbankThe importan ce of la bour market ﬂ  exi bility in the event of asymmetri c sho cks in a curren cy union – 
DSGE simulations for Germany
Flexi ble la bour markets are beneﬁ cial for a variety of e co-
nomi c reasons. They make efﬁ  cient la bour input possi ble, 
whi ch is a key pre con dition for makin g use of the a dvan-
tages of te chnolo gical chan ge an d thus stren gthenin g 
the lon g-term for ces of growth. Furthermore, they are 
also a key fa ctor in an e conomy ’s short to me dium-term 
adjustment to e conomi c sho cks . This is all the more the 
case in a monetary union where the uniform monetary 
poli cy means that it is the la bour market whi ch bears 
the onus of a djustment in the event of disruptions that 
affe ct the countries in different ways. The wa ge-settin g 
pro cess is very important in this context.
These interrelate d fa ctors are illustrate d below usin g a 
mo del simulation, whi ch is base d on the Bun desbank ’s 
DSGE mo del.1 This is a dynami c sto chasti c general 
equili brium mo del for the German e conomy, whi ch is 
base d on an intertemporal optimisation assumption for 
all the analyse d se ctors (mi cro foun dations) an d whi ch 
mo dels the inter depen den cies between these se ctors in 
their entirety ( general e quili brium). The simulations are 
base d on a spe ciﬁ cation in the form of a three-re gion 
mo del consistin g of Germany, the euro area ex cluding 
Germany, an d the “rest of the worl d”. This means that 
the rea ctions of the relevant ma croe conomi c varia bles to 
sho cks can be mo delle d separately for Germany an d for 
the rest of the euro area. 
The chart on the fa cing pa ge illustrates, for differin g 
degrees of wa ge ﬂ exi bility, the rea ction of output, 
consumption, inﬂ  ation an d the real ex chan ge rate fol-
lowin g an (unexpe cted) in crease in pro ductivity in the 
euro area (ex cluding Germany). This is shown in the 
form of impulse responses, ea ch of whi ch shows how 
the o bserve d varia ble, in rea ction to this sho ck, departs 
from its lon g-term e quili brium (zero) an d then returns 
to it. The soli d lines describe the effe cts in Germany an d in the rest of the euro area if wa ges in Germany are 
comparatively inﬂ  exi ble. The dashe d lines show the cor-
respon ding adjustments if wa ges in Germany are ﬂ  exi ble 
(an d wa ge ﬂ exi bility remains un chan ged in the rest of 
the euro area). 
The in crease in pro ductivity in the rest of the euro area 
initially lowers unit la bour costs there. This lea ds to 
lower consumer pri ce inﬂ  ation in the curren cy area as a 
whole. As a result of this, the central bank in the mo del 
stimulates deman d by cuttin g interest rates. As inﬂ  ation 
rates – driven by pro ductivity – decline more sharply in 
the rest of the euro area than they do in Germany, Ger-
many experien ces a real appre ciation within the mon-
etary union. Taken in isolation, this dampens output in 
Germany. Over time, however, the inﬂ  ation differential 
within the monetary union becomes smaller an d, with 
it, the appre ciation effe ct. Conse quently, the asso ciate d 
dampenin g effe cts on ma croe conomi c a ctivity peter 
out. Owin g to the more favoura ble pri ce outlook, both 
regions experien ce a dire ct in crease in consumption, 
with an a ccompanyin g deterioration in the net external 
asset position for Germany. This means that the hi gher 
level of consumption in Germany is ma de possi ble by the 
increase in output in the rest of the euro area.
It may be seen from the impulse responses that the effe cts 
are heavily depen dent on wa ge ﬂ exi bility in the German 
labour market. A more rapi d adjustment of wa ges in 
Germany brin gs a bout an a ccelerate d wa ge a djustment 
in the euro area as a whole. This is reﬂ  ected in the sharp 
initial rea ction of inﬂ  ation rates in both re gions. The 
inﬂ ation- dampenin g effe ct is stron ger in the rest of the 
euro area than it is in Germany, however. The inﬂ  ation 
differential after a sho ck is therefore all the greater, 
the more ﬂ  exi ble wa ges an d pri ces are. This means that 
Germany ’s imme diate real appre ciation is sharper than

45woul d be the case if wa ges were not so ﬂ  exi ble. At the 
same time, however, greater wa ge ﬂ exi bility in Germany 
allows a sharper fall in real wa ges. This dampens the 
decline in employment an d output. Overall, greater 
wa ge ﬂ exi bility allows more rapi d pri ce a djustments, 
whi ch means that the levels of output an d consump-tion in the German e conomy a djust more quickly to the 
new e conomi c con ditions. This is beneﬁ cial because it 
weakens the dampenin g effe cts on output in Germany 
an d shortens their duration an d makes a hi gher level of 
consumption possi ble. Flexi ble la bour markets therefore 
make it easier to cope with sho cks.

46unsound public finances which, over the long
term, could jeopardise price stability in the
euro area. Rules to this effect were incorpor-
ated into the Maastricht Treaty, and the SGP
was adopted. In Germany itself, the budget
situation initially developed favourably fol-
lowing 1997, the decisive year for admission
to monetary union, in which Germany had
fallen just below the upper total government
deficit limit of 3% of GDP . The lowest deficit
ratio24to date since reunification, 1.2%, was
achieved in 2000 against the background of
favourable cyclical developments and a boom
in profit-dependent taxes.
The economic slowdown at the beginning of
the decade following the end of the New
Economy boom, tax reductions and, above
all, the dramatic reversal of the trends in
profit-dependent taxes caused the deficit
ratio to rise sharply in subsequent years.
Since, in the years of favourable economic ac-
tivity, the country had failed to establish a suf-
ficiently sound structural foundation, the 3%
reference value was actually exceeded in
2002. This meant that in 2003 Germany was
the second country (after Portugal) to see the
opening of an excessive deficit procedure.
When, at the end of 2003, it looked more and
more likely that Germany and France were not
going to be able to correct their excessive def-
icits by the set deadline, the European Com-
mission proposed a tightening of the proced-
ure. The majority of the Council of Economic
and Finance Ministers (Ecofin), however, did
not follow this recommendation. The contro-
versy, which sprang largely from Germany’s
fiscal policy, culminated at the European levelin 2005 in adjustments to the SGP . It was par-
ticularly the large euro-area countries, includ-
ing Germany, which helped to water down
the original framework of budgetary rules.
The violation of the European budgetary
rules, moreover, also influenced the debate on
national budgetary rules. In that regard, fun-
damental deficiencies had already been seen
before monetary union. The discrepancy be-
tween the European rules and commitments
and the constitutional upper deficit limits valid
in Germany, however, have now become ob-
vious: although the former virtually mandated
at least a nearly balanced structural overall
budget, Germany’ s national rules leave a
much larger discretionary scope by limiting
borrowing only to the amount of gross invest-
ment – and also by leaving numerous loop-
holes.
In the light of this apparent contradiction, in
2002 the objective of reducing new borrow-
ing by the central and state governments
until the achievement of a balanced budget
and the requirement that the various levels of
government comply with European agree-
ments was enshrined in the Budget Principles
Act ( Haushaltsgrunds/C228tzegesetz ). The Finan-
cial Planning Council was given a stronger
role in coordinating the central and state
budget policies.25Moreover, in 2006 the
intra-governmental division of the penalties
imposed at European level was enshrined in
the German constitution. However, it must

47be noted that all of these new rules have
ultimately remained largely ineffective. Oneway to achieve a sustainable solution wouldbe to enshrine a structurally (nearly) balancedbudget for the Federal Government and theindividual states in the constitution. This isprovided for in a proposal by the Federal Min-istry of Finance, which is currently being dis-cussed in the Federalism Commission II.
Irrespective of the problems posed by the
reformed Pact, it must still be rememberedthat the European rules have, in fact, helpedmake it easier to politically implement reformsand consolidation measures through externalpressure. The structural deficit declined quick-
ly after 2004, and in 2006 the excessive def-icit procedure against Germany was aban-doned. With the support of a dramatic rise inprofit-related taxes, the goal of a structurallybalanced overall budget was almost achievedin 2007. However, there are considerablerisks for the future, especially in the currentenvironment in which the economic down-turn and the comprehensive financial systemstabilisation measures will subject the fiscalframework to a renewed stress test. Againstthis background, Germany will play a decisiverole in future in ensuring sound fiscal policy inmonetary union.
