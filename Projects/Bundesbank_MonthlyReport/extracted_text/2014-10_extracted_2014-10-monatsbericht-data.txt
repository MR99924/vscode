Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy made hardly any head -
way in the third quarter 2014. As expected, the 
economic data for July, which were superficially 
positive, were followed by a strong counter -
movement in August. This up and down move -
ment was essentially due to the school holidays 
in some federal states being shifted from July 
to the two following months. This was notice -
able mainly in car production, where this year’s 
plant shutdowns were concentrated on August 
to a large extent. If the average of the third 
quarter is considered on account of these 
holiday-  related shifts, (which is even more ad -
visable this year than in other years), a further 
slight slowdown in industrial activity is appar -
ent compared with the second quarter. This 
 applies to both production and new orders and 
is in line with the deterioration in business sen -
timent. There were more holidays in September 
compared with the average of the past few 
years, which might further depress the quar -
terly average. Even so, in the automotive indus -
try, according to association statements, the 
level of output has already largely returned to 
normal this month.
It is likely that industry will make a slightly 
negative contribution to gross domestic prod -
uct in the third quarter. Construction is also un -
likely to have generated any major positive 
stimuli. However, this contrasted with quite 
good consumption activity, which benefited 
from the strong employment growth and 
marked increases in real wages; this meant that 
aggregate output may have more or less held 
up at the level of the second quarter or even 
shown a slight increase. The outlook for the 
fourth quarter is similarly muted in view of 
sluggish new orders and gloomier business 
sentiment.Industry
After seasonal adjustment, industrial output 
declined strongly by 4¾% in August following 
the substantial increase in July. This reversal is 
mainly due to the 25% fall in car production, 
which can be explained by the unusual concen -
tration of plant shutdowns in this month. These 
holiday effects had only a minor impact on the 
other sectors. Taking the average of July and 
August, industrial output decreased slightly by 
½% compared with the second quarter. The 
output of intermediate goods declined by ¾%, 
whilst output of capital goods and consumer 
goods just about held up.
Sales were down by a seasonally adjusted 3% 
from July to August, but, on an average of July 
and August, remained largely unchanged com -
pared with the previous quarter. Domestic sales 
decreased slightly, while foreign sales increased 
a little. Exports of goods rose by as much as 
2% on an average of July and August. Here 
too, a high figure for July was followed by a 
lower figure for August. Imports weakened 
only slightly in August and in a comparison of 
July and August remained just ½% down on 
the previous quarter.
In August, new orders for German industry 
underwent a steep decline of 5¾% on the 
month. Orders of other transport equipment 
witnessed the sharpest fall, although it should 
be noted that the July figure had been revised 
upwards by one- fifth owing to a late report. 
On an average of July and August, the average 
of the second quarter was nearly maintained 
(-¼%). Orders of capital goods showed an in -
crease (1%) in fact whereas orders of inter -
mediate goods contracted by 1½%. On an 
average of July and August, domestic demand 
was down on the second quarter by 1½%. By 
contrast, export orders were up slightly by ½% 
on the quarter due to the substantial amount 
of large orders in July.Opposing move-

Construction
According to initial estimates, construction out -
put declined significantly in August by 2% after 
seasonal adjustment. The dates of the holidays 
may have been one of the causes, but even 
taking the average of July and August, con -
struction activity could only just maintain the 
already weak level of the second quarter. In 
building construction and civil engineering the 
figure was down by as much as 1% on the pre -
ceding three- month period. Only the finishing 
trades registered an increase of ¾%.
New orders in the main construction sector in 
July (more recent data are not yet available) 
saw a steep increase of 7½% on the month, 
 although this only matched the average level of 
the second quarter. The volume of orders in 
housing construction decreased considerably, 
whilst rising very steeply in commercial con -
struction and also increasing sharply in public 
sector construction.
Labour market
Employment is still on an upward trend but the 
pace of growth appears to have receded some -
what recently. In August, the number of per -
sons in work went up by a seasonally adjusted 
26,000 on the month. This represented an in -
crease of 355,000, or 0.8%, on the same 
period last year. According to initial estimates, 
employment subject to social security contribu -
tions rose by 30,000 in July. In year- on- year 
terms, the overall increase amounted to 
528,000, or 1.8%. Enterprises’ willingness to 
recruit staff remained slightly expansionary in 
September according to the Ifo employment 
barometer, and the Federal Employment Agen -
cy’s BA-  X job index showed some improve -
ment.
In September, the unemployment rate (using 
the Federal Employment Agency’s definition) 
remained at the previous month’s level of 
6.7%, although the seasonally adjusted num -Construction

ber of persons registered as unemployed rose 
marginally by 13,000. However, the number of 
unemployed was down by 41,000 on the year. 
Underemployment remained unchanged on 
the month.
Prices
The price for a barrel of Brent crude oil in Sep -
tember was down 4½% on the average for 
 August. Crude oil prices showed a clear down -
ward tendency in the first half of October in 
view of an abundant supply and weak demand. 
As this report went to press, a barrel of Brent 
crude oil cost US$84¾. The discount on crude 
oil futures was US$2¼ for deliveries six months 
ahead and US$4¼ 12 months ahead.
Along with falling prices for crude oil, the 
 depreciation of the euro was reflected in  import 
prices in August. This is why they declined by 
only 0.1% on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms and rose by 0.3% if energy is excluded. 
Domestic producer prices remained unchanged. 
In year- on- year terms, import prices fell by 
1.9% and at the domestic producer level there 
was a decline of 0.8%.
Consumer price inflation strengthened some -
what in September. Prices for food and indus -
trial goods increased slightly in seasonally ad -
justed terms. The annual rate of inflation stood 
at 0.8% as measured by both the national con -
sumer price index (CPI) and the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).
Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the latest cash data from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office, in the second quarter of 
2014 the surplus recorded by the local govern -
ment core budgets and off- budget entities 
( including special- purpose associations) fell by 
€¾ billion on the year to €2¾ billion.2 This  development is the result of the ongoing sharp 
growth in expenditure already observed at the 
start of 2014 (+7%, or €3½ billion), with per -
sonnel expenditure (+5%), operating expend -
iture (+7%), social benefits (+6%), and expend -
iture on capital formation (+17%) in particular, 
continuing to soar. Despite the introduction of 
the first stage of the pay agreement that was 
concluded in spring 2014, in the second quar -
ter of 2014 growth rates for personnel expend -
iture were only slightly higher on the year than 
in the previous quarter. These growth rates are 
also likely to continue to show the effects of 
expanding the reporting group to include spe -
cial- purpose associations. By contrast, interest 
expenditure fell further (-5%). The increase in 
revenue (+5%, or just over €2½ billion) was 
 attributable in almost equal measure to the 
 renewed sharp rise in taxes (+5¼%, or €1 bil -
lion) and to the transfers from state govern -
ment (including a renewed rise in central gov -
ernment’s contribution to the basic allowance 
for the elderly, which is transferred to local 
government via state government). In particu -
lar, local government’s share in income tax and 
earnings from property tax recorded significant 
growth, while net revenue from local business 
tax (after deducting the shares accruing to 
other government levels) was up slightly.
Local government’s fiscal deficit totalled €2 bil -
lion in the first half of 2014, which amounted 
to a year- on- year increase of just under €1½ 
billion. In view of this development, the surplus Further signifi-

 reporting group
1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
general government budget trends during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed statistical data on budgetary develop -
ments and public debt, see the statistical section of this 
report.
2 The reporting group for off- budget entities in the quar -
terly cash statistics was expanded from 2014 onwards to 
include special- purpose associations belonging to the 
 government sector. As the comparative figures from the 
previous year could not be fully replicated, only a limited 
year- on- year comparison of the fiscal deficit/surplus and in -
dividual expenditure and revenue items is possible. Further -
more, the gradual introduction of double- entry bookkeep -
ing continued to have an impact on the quality of cash 
data.Deutsche Bundesbank

for the year as a whole is now expected to be 
small at best (2013: €1 billion). While the rapid 
growth in personnel expenditure is likely to 
continue, not least owing to the negotiated 
wage increase and the extension of childcare 
for infants, and there are still no signs of a 
 noticeable slowdown in operating expenditure 
and social benefit rises, general- purpose trans -
fers from state government and central govern -
ment’s increased financial contribution to social 
benefits in particular are expected to provide 
relief on the revenue side. Central govern -
ment’s plans to grant local authorities €1 billion 
for integration assistance in 2015 will provide 
additional relief. However, this could be coun -
teracted by revenue shortfalls in connection 
with a henceforth downward revision in macro -
economic growth.
Despite the surplus recorded in the second 
quarter of 2014, debts attributable to local 
government core budgets and off- budget en -
tities (including special- purpose associations) rose slightly (by €½ billion) on the quarter to 
reach €143 billion. Credit market debt ac -
counted for €89 billion of this figure, while 
€49½ billion was related to cash advances and 
€4½ billion was attributable to debt to other 
government sectors. Consequently, cash ad -
vances – which are only intended for bridging 
short-  term liquidity shortfalls – remained at a 
very high level. Among the four federal states 
with the highest local government debt per 
capita,  the credit market debt and cash ad -
vances of municipalities in Hesse increased the 
most (despite a surplus calculated in terms of 
cash inflow as a result of strong growth in tax 
receipts). Further increases in high outstanding 
cash advances were likewise recorded in Saar -
land and to a somewhat lesser extent in North 
Rhine-  Westphalia, while debt was reduced in 
Rhineland- Palatinate. However, as a general 
rule, there are also significant differences in 
debt levels from one municipality to the other 
within these federal states.3 That being said, 
overall it is likely that many local governments 
will still need to substantially consolidate their 
finances.
Securities markets
Bond market
In August 2014, gross issuance on the German 
bond market stood at €110.9 billion, down on 
the previous month’s figure of €118.4 billion. 
After deducting redemptions, which decreased 
considerably, and taking account of changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the vol -
ume of outstanding domestic bonds rose by 
€14.9 billion, compared with a drop of €3.0 bil -
lion in July. The outstanding volume of foreign 
debt securities in the German bond market fell 
by €5.9 billion net in August; the largest de -
crease was recorded in euro- denominated debt Slight surplus at

securities. On balance, the outstanding volume 
of bonds in Germany thus rose by €9.0 billion.
In the reporting month, the public sector raised 
€11.5 billion net in the capital market. For the 
most part, this was attributable to central gov -
ernment (€8.8 billion), which issued mainly 
two- year Federal Treasury notes ( Schätze , €4.7 
billion), ten- year bonds (€3.2 billion) and five-  
year Federal notes (Bobls, €2.5 billion) on bal -
ance. By contrast, it principally redeemed Treas -
ury discount paper (Bubills totalling €1.8 billion) 
on balance. In the month under review, the 
Federal states tapped the capital market for 
€2.7 billion net.
German credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €4.7 billion on balance in 
August. In particular, they issued other bank 
debt securities that can be structured flexibly 
(€4.1 billion net) but also, albeit to a lesser ex -
tent, debt securities issued by specialised credit 
institutions (€0.8 billion) as well as public 
Pfandbriefe  (€0.5 billion).
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
redeemed own bonds totalling €1.3 billion in 
net terms, compared with a net issuance of 
€5.1 billion in July. On balance, they mainly 
 redeemed paper with a maturity of over one 
year.
Non- resident investors were the sole pur -
chasers on the German bond market in August, 
adding debt securities with a value of €15.7 bil -
lion to their portfolios. By contrast,  domestic 
credit institutions and domestic non- banks sold 
bonds for €2.7 billion and €2.2 billion net 
 respectively.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises, most of which were listed companies, 
issued €0.3 billion net worth of new shares on 
the German equity market. At the same time, 
the volume of foreign shares outstanding on the German market decreased by €1.8 billion. 
On balance, equities were bought exclusively 
by foreign investors (€1.4 billion). By contrast, 
domestic credit institutions and non- banks 
 issued shares worth €2.0 billion and €0.9 bil -
lion respectively, in net terms.
Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded a net inflow of 
€9.5 billion in August (July: inflow of €8.6 bil -
lion). This benefited specialised funds reserved 
for institutional investors in particular (€7.1 bil -
lion). Among the asset classes, it was mainly 
mixed securities funds (€5.2 billion) and bond- 
based funds (€2.4 billion) that placed shares on 
the market. During the month under review, 
foreign mutual funds distributed in the German 
market sold shares to the tune of €2.1 billion 
on balance. German non- banks were virtually 
the only net buyers of mutual fund shares 
(€11.7 billion). Non- resident investors acquired Rise in the

fund shares worth €0.1 billion on balance, 
while domestic credit institutions disposed of 
fund shares to the net value of €0.3 billion.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €10.3 billion in August 2014. This was 
€9.8 billion below the level of the previous 
month. The decrease was due mainly to the 
sharp fall in the goods account surplus. The 
deficit on invisible current transactions, which 
comprise services as well as primary and sec -
ondary income, widened only slightly.
The declining surplus in the goods account was 
primarily due to the smaller foreign trade sur -
plus which, according to provisional calcula -
tions by the Federal Statistical Office, shrank by 
€9.4 billion to stand at €14.1 billion, with ex -
ports falling considerably more sharply than im -
ports.
In August, the deficit on invisible current trans -
actions went up by €1.0 billion on the month 
to €4.1 billion. This increase was caused by the 
deficit in the services account, which rose €1.7 
billion on the month to €7.6 billion. This was 
mainly the result of the higher travel expend -
iture which is typical for this time of year. By 
contrast, the deficit in secondary income fell 
€0.6 billion to €2.5 billion, primarily on account 
of reduced government expenditure on contri -
butions to the EU budget. Net receipts in the 
primary income balance rose slightly, climbing 
by €0.1 billion to €6.0 billion.
Amid geopolitical tensions, German cross-  
border portfolio investment generated net cap -
ital imports of €22.4 billion in August. Foreign 
investors stepped up their holdings of domestic 
securities by €17.2 billion. Demand for German 
debt securities was especially high (€15.7 bil -
lion); investors showed a particular preference 
for public sector bonds (€9.7 billion) and money 
market paper (€8.4 billion), while they sold pri -
vate bonds on balance (€2.4 billion). Foreign Current account

investors also increased their exposure to Ger -
man equity instruments, albeit to a lesser ex -
tent (€1.4 billion). By contrast, domestic invest -
ors reduced their holdings of securities issued 
abroad by €5.2 billion. On balance, they off -
loaded both foreign debt securities (€5.9 bil -
lion) and shares (€1.5 billion) and added for -
eign investment fund shares worth €2.1 billion 
to their portfolios.
In August, direct investment generated moder -
ate net capital imports totalling €0.5 billion. 
The fact that non- resident enterprises invested 
more in Germany (€5.4 billion) than domestic 
enterprises did abroad (€4.9 billion) played a 
key role. Foreign investors predominantly 
funded their German affiliates by way of intra- 
group financial loans (€8.3 billion) and, on a 
smaller scale, also raised their equity stakes 
(€1.1 billion); by contrast, they reduced the 
amount of funding provided in the form of 
trade credits (€4.0 billion). Domestic enterprises 
mainly increased their equity stakes abroad 
(€4.8 billion), with funds from reinvested profits 
providing the driving force (€3.4 billion). In 
terms of intra- group funding, the withdrawal of funds from trade credits (€4.2 billion) and 
the granting of financial credits (€4.3 billion) 
practically balanced each other out.
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other assets, saw net capital 
exports of €40.9 billion in August. This was pri -
marily attributable to a €16.3 billion rise in do -
mestic investment abroad and a €24.7 billion 
drop in foreign investment in Germany during 
the same period. Both German enterprises and 
households (€7.6 billion) as well as the German 
government (€8.3 billion) repaid financial loans 
taken up abroad. The Bundesbank’s net claims 
rose by €22.3 billion, €20.8 billion of which 
was attributable to the larger asset position 
caused by an increase in the TARGET2 balance. 
On balance, the reduction in cross- border 
assets and liabilities in other investment led to 
net capital imports of €4.7 billion for monetary 
financial institutions.

Methodological changes in the financial 
accounts – background, approach and 
 selected results
As a result of the introduction of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in September 
2014, the methodological basis of many macroeconomic statistics in the European Union was 
updated and harmonised. The Deutsche Bundesbank’s financial accounts, which form part of the 
national accounts, are directly affected by these new provisions. The main consequences of this 
are an expansion of the reported data and conceptual changes. For example, the data on the 
claims and liabilities of a given sector have been supplemented by comprehensive information 
regarding the sectors vis- à- vis which it has claims and liabilities (debtor/creditor or “from- whom- 
to- whom” relationships). Furthermore, households, which had previously been shown together 
with non- profit institutions serving households, are recorded separately for the first time. In add -
ition, reporting of the financial sector is now substantially decomposed into nine sub- sectors. At 
instrument level, the changes are reflected inter alia in the reporting of claims on insurance 
reserves and pension entitlements as well as in the separate recording of cash holdings.
The expanded reporting of financial flows addresses recent developments in the product and cap -
ital markets, which have seen such innovations as the market entry of new players and more 
complex activities. For instance, the latest results of the financial accounts pursuant to ESA 2010 
show that the sectors are interconnected through numerous financial links, with the scale and 
intensity of the links between the sectors varying significantly in some cases. The methodological 
changes thus help to create a better understanding of activities in the financial sphere of the 
economy and provide valuable data, including for monetary policy purposes – with regard to 
monetary transmission or identifying possible financing bottlenecks, for example – as well as for 
financial stability analyses.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
As a result of the introduction of the European 
System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in Sep -
tember 2014, the methodological basis of 
many macroeconomic statistics in the Euro -
pean Union (EU) was updated and harmonised 
further. This framework contains binding provi -
sions and definitions for the statistical record -
ing of the economic process and thus ensures 
a uniform and comparable documentation of 
economic developments in all EU member 
states. The update aims to take account of 
changes in economic activity that have oc -
curred since the introduction of the previous 
ESA 1995 so as to continue to have “compar -
able, up- to- date and reliable information on 
the structure of the economy and the develop -
ment of the economic situation of each mem -
ber state”.1 Among the more extensive of these 
changes are the increasing globalisation of 
goods production and a structural change in 
the financial sector, which has seen its inter -
mediation function and structure become ever 
more complex as a result of regulatory changes, 
financial innovations and advances in informa -
tion and communication technology. Further -
more, the update addresses the new and modi -
fied requirements placed on statistics by mon -
etary and economic policy, which have arisen 
inter alia  in connection with the financial crisis.
The Deutsche Bundesbank’s financial accounts, 
which form part of the national accounts, are 
directly affected by this update. The financial 
accounts supplement the aggregated presenta -
tion of flows in the real sector by reporting par -
allel transactions in the financial sphere, and 
thus show to what extent and in what form 
(loans, shares, deposits etc) the various sectors 
of the economy provided or took up funds in 
the period under review. The financial inter -
mediaries involved are also recorded. Com -
bined with consistent documentation on the 
corresponding stocks, ie the sectors’ financial 
assets and liabilities, this creates a comprehen -
sive picture of financial activities in the German 
economy.This article describes the key conceptual 
changes resulting from the adoption of ESA 
2010 in the financial accounts. It then presents 
selected results and gives an outline of how 
they are used in monetary policy analyses. The 
challenges and problems faced when imple -
menting specific provisions are also discussed.
Overview of key changes
In contrast to previous amendments to the 
methodological requirements, the adoption of 
ESA 2010 in the financial accounts is primarily 
reflected in an expansion of the existing data 
set, with only a few changes being made to 
the definitions of sectors and instruments. Con -
sequently, the previously documented data de -
velopments based on ESA 1995 largely still 
hold true in terms of direction and dynamics.
A key element of the changes resulting from 
the introduction of ESA 2010 is the expanded 
reporting on sectors and instruments,2 with 
previously aggregated items now shown separ -
ately and additional elements included. For ex -
ample, the sectors households and non-  profit 
institutions serving households will henceforth 
be recorded separately. The way in which the 
financial sector is reported has changed signifi -
cantly, with it now being broken down into 
nine sub- sectors. This is due to an expanded 
definition of the financial sector which includes 
entities, such as special purpose vehicles, which 
offer their financial services exclusively to a par -
ticular group, rather than solely comprising ESA 2010

1 See section 1 of Regulation (EU) No 549/ 2013 of 21 May 
2013. The update of the ESA was triggered by the revision 
of the “System of National Accounts 1993” (SNA 1993), 
the internationally applicable basis for relevant statistics. 
Like its predecessor, the concept and contents of SNA 
2008 are largely identical to ESA 2010, with the latter 
being tailored to the specific concerns of the EU.
2 The introduction of ESA 2010 has also led to changes in 
the reporting requirements of national central banks and 
statistical offices vis- à- vis European institutions. Reporting 
requirements vis- à- vis the ECB are now governed by Guide -
line ECB/ 2013/ 24 of 25 July 2013. The reporting require -
ments vis- à- vis the European Commission are laid down in 
Regulation (EU) No 549/ 2013 of 21 May 2013. The corres -
ponding changes in the financial accounts are considered 
below.Deutsche Bundesbank

agents that offer their financial services exclu -
sively to the general public, as had previously 
been the case. With regard to financial instru -
ments, the changes primarily affect claims on 
insurance reserves and pension entitlements, 
with regard both to additional instruments and 
the classification structure. Furthermore, cash 
holdings are for the first time recorded separ -
ately from deposits. Finally, the designations of 
some financial instruments have been changed, 
inter alia  to take account of the expanded re -
cording of data. The charts on pages 15 and 16 
show the new structure of the sectors and in -
struments. All of the additional reporting gen -
erally affects both flows (ie the acquisition of 
financial assets and external financing) and 
stocks (ie financial assets and liabilities).
One of the key ways in which reporting has 
been extended is by recording debtor/creditor 
relationships for the first time. The previously 
reported data on a sector’s claims and liabilities 
are now enhanced by recording the sectors vis- 
à- vis which it has existing or new claims and 
liabilities. These intersectoral links are being re -
corded for all domestic sectors and the follow -
ing financial instruments: deposits, loans, debt 
securities, listed shares, and investment fund 
shares. Domestic sectors’ links with the rest of 
the world are also taken into account, with 
euro- area debtors likewise being broken down by sector.3 These data enable conclusions to be 
drawn regarding, for example, what role do -
mestic banks play in the funding of non-  
financial corporations, to what extent banks 
are interconnected with other financial sector 
players (insurance corporations, other financial 
intermediaries etc) or the proportion of foreign 
sovereign bonds in the household portfolio. 
Reporting debtor/creditor relationships also 
leads to more accurate calculations of the con -
solidated data (ie adjusted for intrasectoral re -
lationships).
ESA 2010 has also resulted in valuation and 
other volume and classification changes being 
collected and recorded separately and in detail 
for individual instruments and sectors for the 
first time. This is because changes in the stock 
of claims and liabilities during a reporting 
period may stem not only from corresponding 
flows but also from valuation effects or changes 
to the statistical classifications of individual 
 financial instruments and sectors. Valuation 
changes primarily comprise price changes that 
occur during the reporting period, such as ris -
ing share prices. Such changes in value are 
mainly recorded for instruments for which 
“genuine” market prices are available (eg Comprehensive

shares), whereas items recorded at nominal 
value (eg deposits) are barely affected.4 The 
other volume and classification changes com -
prise changes in the classification of sectors 
and instruments, and the impact of unforesee -
able events on the stock of claims and liabil -
ities. If, for example, a non-  financial corpor -
ation acquires a full banking licence and is 
therefore granted authorisation to be active in 
both deposit and lending business, it will 
henceforth be recorded in the monetary finan -
cial institutions (MFIs) sector. Complete write-  
offs of bad debts will also be recorded under 
this category. This constitutes a significant ex -
pansion of the data set compared with the pre -vious calculation standard, which merely ag -
gregated valuation and other classification and 
volume changes for internal purposes.
Alongside the more comprehensive recording 
of the results, there are also some conceptual 
changes in the financial accounts. The most im -
portant modification concerns a new differenti -
ation between holding companies and head 
offices following the broadening of the defin -
ition of the financial sector. Both terms are Conceptual

used to refer to corporate entities which, in 
one form or another, are responsible for 
(majority- held) subsidiaries. In the case of hold -
ing companies, this responsibility takes the 
form of controlling their subsidiaries’ assets. 
They have no other ways of exerting influence, 
such as managerial functions. By contrast, head 
offices do have managerial functions. Thus, an 
entity should be classified as a head office 
whenever it actively exercises managerial con -
trol over subsidiaries. Whereas holding com -
panies should always be assigned to the finan -
cial sector (more specifically, the new sub-  
sector “captive financial institutions and money 
lenders”), head offices are classified according 
to the sector to which the majority of the sub -
sidiaries’ value added is assignable. Since under 
the previous ESA 1995 such a distinction be -
tween holding companies and head offices 
was not made and all entities were assigned to 
non- financial corporations, ESA 2010 results in 
shifts to the financial sector.5
More minor conceptual changes include a 
stricter definition of entities assigned to the 
general government sector and a more com -
prehensive definition of financial derivatives.6 
However, these changes do not have a major 
impact on the results of the German financial 
accounts.7
As is the case in the national accounts, in prin -
ciple all methodological changes should be im -
plemented also with retroactive effect. One of 
the reasons for this is to prevent statistical 
breaks in the time series impairing the analysis 
of the results. This applies above all to concep -
tual changes and the expanded reporting on 
flows and stocks of already existing sectors and 
instruments. Therefore, in accordance with the 
relevant European provisions, by 2017 at the 
latest all changes concerning quarterly data 
should be recalculated back to 1999, while 
 annual data should already be recorded from 
the present day back to 1995. By contrast, 
back-  calculations for data affected by more 
large- scale changes – such as debtor/creditor relationships or valuation changes – are only 
 required for shorter periods of time.
Selected results
The ESA 2010 rules were applied to the finan -
cial accounts for the first time when calculating 
the data for the second quarter of 2014, which 
were published in mid- October.8 Data collected 
pursuant to ESA 1995 up until the first quarter 
of 2014 will continue to be made available until 
further notice with their updated figures. From 
now on, however, any changes – such as those 
resulting from retroactive revisions of primary 
sources – will only be included in the calcula -
tions pursuant to ESA 2010.
Selected results of the analysis of the expanded 
data are discussed below.

5 For example, pursuant to ESA 1995, a corporate entity 
that controls several subsidiaries (primarily) active in the 
non- financial area should itself likewise be assigned to the 
non- financial sector. This is the case irrespective of whether 
this entity is involved in the management of the subsidiar -
ies or merely holds their assets. Under ESA 2010, this entity 
should only remain in the non- financial sector if it has an 
active management role. If it simply holds the assets, it 
should definitely be reassigned to the financial sector as a 
“captive money lender”.
6 In the context of the introduction of ESA 2010, the cal -
culation of financial derivatives has been revised. Primary 
sources not previously available in this form were also in -
cluded in the calculation. For most sectors, this has resulted 
in a – in some cases considerable – extension of the bal -
ance sheet. However, the changes which are directly attrib -
utable to the adoption of ESA 2010 are relatively small.

changes between ESA 2010 and ESA 1995, see Eurostat

9 As no data on debtor/creditor relationships are available 
for some financial instruments – such as unlisted shares 
and other equity – the actual financial interconnections are 
likely to be even greater than as shown in the chart. This 
applies above all to non- financial corporations.Deutsche Bundesbank

the sectors are closely linked to one another via 
numerous financial relationships, both inside 
and outside of Germany. However, the intensity 
of these relationships varies greatly.
For example, households are very closely linked 
to banks and insurance corporations as a large 
part of their financial assets comprise bank de -
posits and claims on insurance reserves. Non-  
financial corporations are also linked to banks 
and insurance corporations via their liabilities, 
although they additionally have financial rela -
tionships with all other sectors. These include 
investment funds, which provide them with 
 resources through the purchase of debt secur -ities and shares; captive financial institutions, 
which manage the intra- group allocation of 
 resources; or the rest of the world, which holds 
a large part of the shares issued by firms and 
thus acts as an important equity capital pro -
vider. The rest of the world also plays an im -
portant role in general government financing, 
with around three- quarters of German public-  
sector debt securities being held in foreign safe Extent and 
 intensity of links 
vary greatly  between sectorsFinancial links between sectors in Germany
Each arrow points to the respective sector on which a given sector has a claim. All financial instruments for which comprehensive 
debtor/creditor relationships exist are taken into account (deposits, debt securities, loans, listed shares, investment fund shares and 
claims on insurance corporations and pension funds). The thickness of the arrow symbolises the total volume of a sector’s claims on 
another sector. The size of the circle represents the financial links within a sector (in the financial accounts, these intra-sectoral links are not recorded for the rest of the world and the household sector). For the sake of clarity, only links with a volume of more than 1%  of 
GDP are shown. Moreover, sectors have been aggregated. For example, investment funds are subsumed under other financial interme-diaries, insurance corporations are shown together with pension funds, and households include non-profit institutions serving house-holds.

custody accounts.10 The majority of sovereign 
bonds that remain within Germany are held by 
MFIs, with all other sectors having only minor 
claims on general government. Instead, insur -
ance corporations and pension funds mainly 
hold domestic investment fund shares, while 
other financial intermediaries invest their funds 
in foreign debt securities, in particular.
Detailed debtor/creditor relationships of this 
kind permit for the first time in- depth analyses 
of the interaction between individual sectors in 
the event of a sudden change in the oper -
ational environment (so- called exogenous 
shocks).11 Network models can be used to 
examine, inter alia,  how sudden asset losses in 
one sector are transmitted to other sectors, 
and the associated impact on the demand for 
goods, for instance.12 For example, asset losses 
that are transmitted via the financial links be -
tween sectors and end up on banks’ balance 
sheets can affect banks’ credit supply and thus 
have an impact on general economic growth. If 
such a tightening in banks’ credit supply results 
in other sectors (eg other financial intermediar -
ies) providing an increased level of funding, the 
corresponding changes in the relationships be -
tween the sectors can likewise be tracked using 
debtor/creditor relationships. Furthermore, it is 
possible to examine how shocks affecting all 
sectors – such as interest rate changes – impact 
on the interaction between the sectors and the 
respective financial positions. Moreover, the 
data permit a more detailed description of the 
interlinkages within the financial system, par -
ticularly between the shadow banking system 
and banks, as well as its ties with the non-  
financial private sector.13 Therefore, analyses 
based on debtor/creditor relationships help to 
provide a better assessment of monetary policy 
transmission and financial stability.
The table on page  20 shows the year-  end 
 financial assets of households in Germany in 
2012 and 2013 as well as the changes during 
the course of 2013 after applying the new cal -
culation method. The financial assets of non-  
profit institutions serving households (churches, trade unions, political parties etc) are shown 
separately. According to the recorded figures, 
German households had financial assets worth 
just under €5 trillion at the end of 2013, while 
non- profit institutions serving households held 
 financial assets of around €156 billion. The 
 respective structure of the portfolios is clearly 
different. Households’ assets largely comprised 
deposits and claims on insurance reserves, 
which made up 39% and 38% respectively of 
this portfolio. The bulk of their holdings of 
 securities and equity took the form of invest -
ment fund shares, which constituted just under 
8% of their financial assets, whereas directly 
held shares and debt securities fell well short of 
this level. While non- profit institutions serving 
households likewise had around 37% of their 
financial assets invested in deposits, at the end 
of 2013 the remaining 63% was entirely in -
vested in securities and equities, one- third of 
which were directly held debt securities. By 
 recording these two sectors separately and not 
together as in the past, the proportion of 
 securities and equities held by households is 
shown to be smaller than was suggested by 
the previous aggregated figures.
Despite the limited weight of securities in the 
household portfolio, they played a key role in 
the rise in this sector’s financial assets during Debtor/creditor 
relationships as a valuable basis for monetary policy analysisSeparate record-

10 Foreign inflows into German sovereign bonds notably 
increased substantially during the financial and economic 
crisis. This was attributable, in particular, to their safe haven 
status. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Yields on Bunds under 
safe haven effects, Monthly Report, October 2010, pp 30-
31. During the course of 2013, the significance of this 
 motive for capital inflows into Germany decreased again 
somewhat. See Deutsche Bundesbank, German balance of 
payments in 2013, Monthly Report, March 2014, pp 35-
50.
11 In the academic literature, financial networks have long 
been mapped as part of macrofinancial analysis. Owing to 
a lack of data, the underlying debtor/creditor relationships 
are mostly estimated. Consequently, this type of analysis is 
fraught with major uncertainty in terms of the actual finan -
cial interlinkages. See O Castren and I Kavonius (2009), Bal -
ance sheet interlinkages and macro- financial risk analysis in 
the euro area, ECB Working Paper, No 1124.

the course of 2013. However, this was solely 
due to valuation gains on instruments already 
held – in particular shares, which picked up 
considerably amid the positive stock market 
 climate on balance in 2013. All in all, around 
one- third of the increase in financial assets 
seen in 2013 was attributable to valuation 
gains. Irrespective of this, households sold 
shares and debt securities in net terms, only 
making net purchases of investment fund 
shares.
The separate recording of the financial assets 
of households and of non- profit institutions 
serving households as well as the differentiated 
presentation of valuation changes and other 
classification changes allow a better assess -
ment of investment behaviour and of the fac -
tors influencing this behaviour (risk appetite, 
 liquidity preference etc). Thus the fact that Ger -
man households offloaded a sizeable net vol -
ume of shares in spite of substantial stock price 
increases points to a certain risk aversion on their part. Moreover, using the data that are 
now available in similar form for other euro-  
area countries, it is easier to discern how mon -
etary policy signals impact on the demand for 
goods –  and ultimately on price develop -
ments – and to see the differences that exist 
in  this regard across euro- area countries. In 
addition, recording these two sectors separ -
ately enhances comparability with data derived 
from sources with a microeconomic perspec -
tive, eg the Eurosystem “Panel on household 
finances”.14

financial corporations. These changes in ESA 
2010 have per se  reduced non- financial corpor -
ations’ liabilities by just over 2% compared 
with the previous level as at the end of 2013, 
while their financial assets simultaneously 
shrank by around 4%; other financial inter -
mediaries saw the value of their assets and 
 liabilities expand accordingly. The volume of 
shifts was similar in previous years, with the 
 result that in overall terms the methodological 
changes have induced an upward or down -
ward shift in the respective level. By contrast, 
the fundamental dynamics have barely 
changed.
However, the shift also has certain effects on 
the relationships between the sectors. Enter -
prises now exhibit reduced direct liabilities to 
MFIs and other businesses but are conversely 
shown as being much more closely intercon -
nected with other financial intermediaries, 
 especially in the form of credit obligations. The 
latter sector now encompasses business units 
like holding companies and other special pur -
pose vehicles which act as captive money lend -
ers and financial institutions but which were 
previously recorded in the enterprise sector 
 itself. This is also reflected in the breakdown of 
the reassigned financial assets, around 70% of 
which are equities in line with the holding com -
panies’ salient feature as owners of a group of 
subsidiaries.
Hence, looking at the financing pattern of non- 
financial corporations –  which is of special 
interest from a monetary policy perspective – 
the new results display no substantial changes 
to Germany’s existing dynamics. They do, how -
ever, offer a better picture of the creditor struc -
ture, making it clear that enterprises also turn 
to other financial intermediaries besides banks. 
Such agents have already occasionally sup -
planted banks in the past15 and it cannot be 
ruled out that enterprises will make increasing 
use of these funding channels in the future, be 
it for tax reasons or because of changes to the 
regulatory framework pertaining to the finan -
cial system. This is especially true of certain euro- area countries in which such financial 
flows have already had a strong impact in the 
past few years.16 Such data differentiation is a 
key prerequisite for being able to better analyse 
and understand the implications for monetary 
policy transmission associated with such reclas -
sifications in the structure of financial inter -
mediation. This applies all the more given that 
the implemented reclassifications probably still 
understate the actual importance of captive 
 financial institutions and money lenders in Ger -
many on account of insufficient information 
from primary sources (see below).
Challenges and problems 
 regarding implementation
Incorporating such extensive methodological 
changes into existing statistics is typically a 
major challenge. The financial accounts are 
secondary statistics that are calculated not on 
the basis of direct surveys but from numerous 
primary statistics which are mainly deployed for 
other purposes. With respect to the financial 
accounts, therefore, implementing ESA 2010 
has made it necessary to re-  evaluate existing 
primary statistics and to make additional use of 
new data sources. The nature and form of the 
necessary adjustments depend both on general 
aspects, in other words factors which apply in 
equal measure to all EU member states, and on 
country- specific particularities of data calcula -
tion. Moreover, adjusting an established set of 
statistics to new methodological requirements 
also presents an opportunity to review and, 
where applicable, revise existing approaches Broader defin-

Methodological changes affecting Germany’s international 
investment position
An economy’s international investment 
position (IIP) shows its residents’ fi  nancial assets and liabilities vis- à- vis non- residents 
valued at market prices at the end of each 
quarter.1 At the end of September 2014, 
the Bundesbank realigned its IIP concept 
with the updated Balance of Payments and 
International Investment Position Manual 
(BPM6) of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF).2 This brought the IIP’s methodo-
logical basis into line with that used in the 
balance of payments, which changed over 
to the new standard with the publication of the data for May 2014.

Quantitative impact
As a result, Germany’s net investment pos-
ition at the end of 2013 now amounts to 
€1,204 billion (43% of gross domestic prod-
uct), which is €121 billion lower than previ-ously reported. The introduction of BPM6 
accounts for €73 billion of this decline; the remaining €48 billion is attributable to revi-sions unrelated to BPM6 that were made at the same time. The largest quantitative im-pact arising from the methodological recal-
culation relates to the fi  rst- time recording of insurance reserves and pension entitle-
ments.4 As this has a greater impact on the 
liability side (€119 billion) than on the asset 
side (€34 billion), it reduces the net IIP by 
€85 billion. This is partly due to recognising 
the insurance claims of foreign workers 
who return to their home country. The pen-
sion entitlements of retirees who have taken up permanent residence outside of 
Germany are also recorded under this item.
Germany’s net IIP falls by a further €13 bil-
lion as a result of the modifi  ed recording of 
special drawing rights (SDRs) created and 
allocated by the IMF. Although these were 
already recorded hitherto on the asset side 
(under “reserve assets”), a corresponding counter- entry is now also included on the 
liability side (under “other investment”). The 
logic behind this is that the BPM6 concur-
rently defi  nes SDRs as a liability since they may have to be repaid under certain cir-cumstances. Under the new accounting practice, the allocation of SDRs increases 
reserve assets but has no impact on the net

changes raise the net IIP by approximately 
€25 billion.
Integrated external statement and 
 reconciliation account
The integrated statement of external statis-
tics reconciles the IIP with the balance of 
payments by allocating changes in IIP stock 
data to fi  nancial account transactions, valu-
ation effects resulting from exchange rate and market price movements as well as other adjustments
5. Although transactions 
usually have the largest impact on changes 
in the net IIP in the longer term, valuation 
effects are also signifi  cant. In the 2013  reporting year, valuation effects totalled -€7 billion on balance. Market price gains 
of €40 billion were offset by exchange rate losses amounting to €47 billion. With grow-
ing gross stock fi  gures and a rising net IIP , 
these effects – depending on the portfolio structure – are playing a greater role in ex-plaining IIP dynamics.

The importance of the detailed information from the reconciliation account for a robust 
analysis can be illustrated for 2013 by the example of German government bonds. 
 Focusing solely on the decline of €62 billion in liabilities stocks might give the impression 
that foreign investors shunned German 
government bonds. However, non- residents 
actually purchased €29 billion worth of

claims, changes in sectoral classifi  cations, changes to 
the functional category of a fi  nancing instrument, and 
statistical discrepancies between the IIP and the bal-
ance of payments due to differing data sources. At 
present, changes in fi  nancial derivative stock data un-
related to transactions are also fully recorded under

and calculations with a view to further improv -
ing the quality of the output.
Compared with past implementations of such 
methodological revisions, the current revision 
was generally simplified by the fact that many 
of the available primary statistics are now 
themselves aligned with the ESA approach. 
Sectors and instruments are often uniformly 
defined and recorded, and the need for labori -
ous adjustments to the financial accounts can 
be reduced or dispensed with altogether. Much 
the same applies to periodicity. Most primary 
data are now made available on a quarterly 
basis and in some instances even monthly; 
sources with an annual frequency are hardly 
used. In most cases, timely availability also no 
longer presents a problem as the relevant 
deadlines have been further shortened in re -
cent years. Overall, the conditions for fully in -
corporating the new provisions into the finan -
cial accounts are thus better than for past revi -
sions, meaning that consistent, robust and high- quality results will continue to be delivered 
following completion of the changeover.
One of the key remaining challenges is process -
ing those primary sources that are still based on 
the classification structure of ESA 1995 or that 
fall short of the requirements for the financial 
accounts in terms of their implementation of 
ESA 2010. For instance, the monthly balance 
sheet statistics of banks (MFIs) will not apply 
the new provisions on a Europe- wide basis 
until the reporting month December 2014.17 
The insurance statistics are not likely to switch 
over to the new system until Solvency II has 
been introduced and the associated revisions 
to the data pool have been made. As regards 
the balance of payments statistics, the new 
methodology was already used for the report -
ing month of May 2014, and for the inter -Conditions for 
implementing methodological revisions gener-ally better than in the pastKey challenges exist in process-
ing some pri-
mary sources lacking the ( sufficiently  detailed)  structure of ESA 2010, …German government bonds on balance last 
year. The recorded decline is solely attribut-able to valuation effects of almost -€91 bil-
lion due to a fall in the prices of German 
long- dated bonds.
Market price and exchange rate movements 
also had a signifi  cant impact on the Bun-
desbank’s reserve assets in 2013. In particu-
lar, the 28% drop in the gold price caused a valuation loss of €46 billion. German direct 
investors sustained exchange rate losses of 
€35 billion. Given their exposure to BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), 
they were noticeably affected by the depre-ciation of the BRIC currencies that started in 
spring 2013. Other investment likewise felt 
the effects of the euro’s appreciation. As 
more assets than liabilities are denominated 
in foreign currencies, this resulted in net 
book losses of €9 billion.Expanded publication programme
The quarterly IIP data are published in Stat-
istical Supplement 3 to the Monthly Report, 
in the balance of payments statistics and on 
the Bundesbank’s website.7 Each year at 
the end of September, the IIP of the previ-
ous year is presented and explained in a 
press release.8 Data compiled according to 
BPM6 are available as of the 2013 reporting year. Quarterly data have been recalculated 
back to 2008 based on BPM5 time series.

national investment position the adjustments 
for the second quarter of 2014 were carried 
out in September 2014. However, in some EU 
member states (including Germany), neither of 
these external sector statistics are as finely 
broken down by sector and instrument as in 
the financial accounts.18 Some data sources 
– such as BaFin’s information on insurance cor -
porations  – do not currently follow the ESA 
2010 model and will not do so in the foresee -
able future either, yet they are currently indis -
pensable for the purposes of the financial ac -
counts. Hence the data gaps have to be 
plugged by using complementary data sources 
and, where appropriate, estimations. In doing 
so, any deviations from these primary statistics 
should be minimised so as to preserve consist -
ency among the various sets of statistics.
In many EU countries, a further challenge is 
posed by the retroactive implementation of the 
new provisions. This is especially the case if 
data from earlier periods in the existing primary 
statistics are either not revised at all or are not 
 revised in a timely manner to the extent 
 required by the European reporting require -
ments for the financial accounts. For example, 
securities issues statistics pursuant to ESA 2010 
are available only as from the reporting month 
of January 2012, while no retroactive revision 
whatsoever is currently envisaged for the 
monthly balance sheet statistics of banks. Ex -
tending the application of the new standards 
to include recalculations for earlier periods add -
itionally limits the range of new primary sources 
that can be used to calculate sectors and in -
struments listed for the first time. Ideally, there 
should be a single source spanning a corres -
pondingly long time period, or alternatively 
there should be several comparable sources 
which, when combined, cover the entire period 
on a consistent basis. In cases where the avail -
able sources do not deliver data for earlier 
periods in line with the new provisions, the 
 figures have to be approximated using model- 
based estimates.The principal challenge specific to Germany is 
implementing the new distinction between 
holding companies and head offices. Differenti -
ating these two business entities, which hith -
erto were invariably combined and aggregated, 
in line with ESA 2010 requires specific informa -
tion on each of them.19 First and foremost, this 
includes data on the entity’s employment and 
earnings situation, which, in the case of most 
German enterprises, are typically contained in 
the national business register. In Germany, this 
register is maintained by the Federal Statistical 
Office and the statistical offices of the federal 
states. Owing to existing legal constraints relat -
ing chiefly to the publication of information 
contained in the register, in Germany – unlike 
in most other EU countries – use of this infor -
mation by the Bundesbank for statistical pur -
poses has hitherto been prohibited. Hence, 
these data may not be used for the financial 
accounts either. For this reason, the task of dif -
ferentiating between holding companies and 
head offices is currently being undertaken, in 
agreement with the Federal Statistical Office, 
using alternative sources, including the Bundes -
bank’s corporate financial statement statistics. 
Rendering the business register usable for the 
aforementioned purposes in the medium term 
requires modifying the legal situation so as to 
allow the Federal Statistical Office to provide 
the Bundesbank with an appropriate volume of 
data from the register. One way of achieving 
this would be through forthcoming amend -… the retro-
active imple-mentation of the new  provisions …… and the full- scale adoption 
of the broader 
definition of the 
financial sector
18 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Changes in the method -
ology and classifications of the balance of payments and 
the international investment position, Monthly Report, 
June 2014, pp 57-68.
19 Since the criteria specified in ESA 2010 for distinguish -
ing between holding companies and head offices are solely 
qualitative in nature, a joint working group set up by the 
ECB, Eurostat and the OECD drew up a set of recommen -
dations with a view to quantifying the criteria as uniformly 
as possible across national borders. Here, the primary focus 
was on the employment and earnings situation of the re -
spective business entities, whereby a very low figure in 
these two categories is indicative of a holding company. 
Each member state nonetheless retains the right to make a 
precise quantification so as to take account of features spe -
cific to that country. The working group recommends that 
this information should continue to be sourced from na -
tional business registers.Deutsche Bundesbank

ments to German statutory regulations apply -
ing to statistics.
Additional difficulties are posed inter alia  by 
the task of ensuring a differentiated presenta -
tion of claims on insurance reserves, pension 
entitlements and standardised guarantee 
schemes (which are for this reason partially 
presented in aggregated form only) and when 
recording unlisted shares, in particular for the 
newly introduced sub- sectors. In this case, too, 
it is sometimes necessary to make use of esti -
mates. Moreover, it is currently only possible to 
collect sound, consistent and comprehensive 
data on debtor/creditor relationships back to 
the beginning of 2013. Overall, the problems 
outlined above lead to occasional deficits in the 
quality of specific data, not least in the case of 
periods further back in time. However, this 
does not compromise the generally high qual -
ity and robustness of the results, nor does it 
affect their possible use for analytical purposes.
Summary and outlook
With the adoption of ESA 2010, the presenta -
tion of the activities in the financial sphere of 
the German economy via the financial accounts 
has become more complex. This complexity is a 
reflection of recent developments in the prod -
uct and capital markets, which have seen inter 
alia the entry of new players and multifaceted 
financial activities. Documenting these activities 
in a consistent and internationally comparable 
fashion helps to foster a better understanding 
of current trends in the financial sphere of the 
economy. These data are particularly useful in 
connection with monetary policy, for example 
when analysing monetary transmission or iden -
tifying potential financing bottlenecks, but they 
are also valuable when analysing financial sta -
bility.To provide the best possible basis for such ana -
lyses, in Germany the new methodological re -
quirements were applied retroactively to 1999 
simultaneously with the changeover, and hence 
more promptly and extensively than required 
by the provisions. In the medium term it is en -
visaged to recalculate the data back to 1991. 
This approach ensures consistency with the 
data on the real sector contained in the na -
tional accounts, which have already incorpor -
ated the ESA 2010 requirements back to 1991. 
It has also helped to reduce the number of 
structural breaks in the time series, thus further 
enhancing their utility for the purpose of eco -
nomic analysis.
Besides entailing changes to the methodology 
used for compiling the financial accounts, im -
plementation of ESA 2010 will also facilitate 
timelier availability of the results in future. Thus 
data will be made available just over three 
months after the end of the reporting quarter, 
which is roughly three weeks earlier than be -
fore. This improves the chance of also being 
able to use the data for current monetary pol -
icy analysis. Over and above this, a number of 
technical innovations were made during the 
changeover, mainly to simplify data exchange 
between national and international institu -
tions.20 Over the medium term, the financial 
accounts will also be required to comply with a 
fixed revision policy specifying a uniform calen -
dar for all euro- area countries to carry out revi -
sions for earlier periods. The details of this pro -
ject are currently being discussed within the 
Eurosytem.Minor difficulties

The German economy in the  
international division of labour:  
a look at value added flows
The German economy has continued to open up over the past 20 years in the wake of advancing 
globalisation. German enterprises have used the opportunities that have been presented by 
 central and east European countries becoming integrated into the European production network 
and by shifts in growth towards the emerging markets. They staked out the position on these 
fast- growing markets early on and achieved cost advantages by making greater use of inter -
national value chains. This was accompanied by a greater degree of specialisation and a sub -
stantial rise in exports and imports, especially in the case of intermediates.
Thanks to new data, it is now possible to present a detailed account of foreign trade in terms of 
value added. This and a comparison with flows of goods provide additional insights into the 
structure of foreign trade and its role in the international division of labour. The revenue and 
expenditure generated in foreign trade of goods and services are increasingly exceeding the 
 volume of cross- border flows of value added. For example, Germany’s value added exports 
amounted to 70% of export revenues on average in 2010 and 2011; in the second half of the 
1990s, the figure was almost 80%. The larger share of foreign value added suggests that the 
success of German exports is increasingly shared with suppliers of inputs and intermediates, 
including from other European countries. In addition, bilateral trade links in particular are becom -
ing more influenced by supply and demand- driven third- country effects. As a result, the import -
ance of individual countries or groups of countries for the German economy’s foreign business is 
also shifting. The most important export destination of the German economy in terms of value 
added is the United States, ahead of France – the frontrunner in gross trade.
From a sectoral perspective, it is mainly the manufacturing sector that is very closely involved in 
international production networks and is therefore a very active participant in intermediate goods 
trade. At around one- fifth, services make up a relatively small share of German exports. By con -
trast, services value added, which is often embedded in merchandise trade, now amounts to 
nearly half of Germany’s export revenues. Thus, competition and cost structures in the services 
sectors are of major importance for the German economy’s international competitiveness.Deutsche Bundesbank

Broadening of global 
 demand and partitioning 
of value chains
Over the past 20 years, there has been a fur -
ther advance in the integration of the German 
economy into the global trade of goods and 
services. Especially after the reunification boom 
faded, German enterprises used the surge of 
globalisation following the fall of the Iron Cur -
tain in the early 1990s and the integration of 
the emerging markets into the global economy 
to open up new sales markets and to achieve 
cost advantages by reorienting supply links and 
creating international production networks. 
Moreover, this period saw an increase in the 
range of foreign- produced products available 
to German consumers.
With the marked intensification of foreign 
trade, the German economy has tended to be -
come more susceptible to external shocks, 
which is reflected in particular by greater de -
pendence on international cyclical fluctuations. 
Openness has nevertheless had a positive im -
pact on the long-  term growth trend, since an 
increasing presence in rapidly growing sales 
markets has made it possible to concentrate 
more on comparative advantages. This has 
opened up sales opportunities that were not 
offered by the domestic markets or by the trad -
itional export regions.
Between 1995 and 2013, the flat path of eco -
nomic growth meant that real final demand in 
Germany increased on average by no more 
than roughly 1% per year. By contrast, Germa -
ny’s export markets, measured in terms of their 
real imports, were expanding by about 5% per 
year. Moreover, sales opportunities in non-  
euro- area markets were increasing significantly 
more quickly than they were within the euro 
area.
The fact that German enterprises sell goods 
and services abroad amounting to roughly 45% 
of nominal gross domestic product (GDP), com -
pared with no more than one- quarter in the second half of the 1990s, is not due solely to 
the sharp expansion in global demand. What 
was just as important was the fact that firms 
succeeded in responding to regional and prod -
uct- specific shifts in the global growth dynam -
ics. According to calculations by UNCTAD,1 the 
weight of the developed economies in global 
merchandise imports has declined over the 
past 20 years from seven- tenths to somewhat 
more than half. The euro area’s share has fallen 
from three- tenths in the second half of the 
1990s to one- quarter at the current end. The 
importance of the United States went down 
during this period from one- sixth to one-  
eighth. The emerging markets – principally in 
Asia – have meanwhile gained strongly in im -
portance. China now accounts for one- tenth of 
global merchandise imports, compared with 
one- fortieth 20 years earlier.
Global demand has become markedly broader 
in terms of its regional distribution. This is 
shown by measures of concentration which 
UNCTAD calculates on the basis of the country- 
specific distribution of global merchandise im -
ports.2 Even so, the process of diversification 
was idiosyncratic for the individual groups of 
products. The automotive industry, for ex -
ample, is faced nowadays with a much more 
variegated global market than it was even 20 
years ago. The same applies to food products 
and mineral fuels. By contrast, there has been 
no regional broadening of demand for machin -
ery and chemical products in the period under 
review, while the available figures in fact show 
a stronger concentration for electrical appli -
ances and equipment.Further advance

Overall, German exporters have well mastered 
the challenges brought about by the structural 
shifts in the global goods markets.3 Germany’s 
share of global merchandise trade has shown a 
moderate decline from 10% to 8% over the 
past 20 years; after adjustment for exchange-  
rate and price effects, it has remained constant, 
however. Applying the relevant concentration 
measures, the regional diversification of global 
demand was accompanied by an almost 
matching regional diversification of German 
goods exports.
A large number of firm- specific measures were 
needed to maintain or boost German export -ers’ competitiveness and thus strengthen their 
position in existing markets or open up new 
ones. An attractive range of goods is character -
ised by high- quality and innovative products 
which also have to be competitively priced. To 
achieve cost advantages, German enterprises 
have broadly focused on a greater international 
division of labour. This is reflected in longer 
value chains, higher shares of intermediates, 
relocating production abroad as well as mer -
gers and cooperation agreements with part -German export -

ners abroad. Furthermore, the increasing com -
plexity of products has led to increased services 
value added from distribution and customer 
services.
From an economic perspective, German enter -
prises responded to the fundamental changes 
in the conditions of supply and demand 
brought about by globalisation. The fact that 
the regions of the globe have become closer 
economically has led to the relative scarcities of 
the production factors being configured differ -
ently now than they were 20 years ago. Be -
sides the increasing fragmentation of produc -
tion processes, which was encouraged by 
lower transport costs as well as easier commu -
nication and coordination, other trends have 
also taken hold. First, global industrial produc -
tion has become perceptibly more capital-  
intensive due, in particular, to the rapid accu -
mulation processes in the emerging market 
economies. Furthermore, there has been an 
increase in the contribution to global value added made by highly skilled labour, while 
 medium and low- skilled jobs have become less 
important over the past 20 years. Correspond -
ing shifts in the advanced economies were the 
key factor behind this.4
For the analysis of foreign trade relationships, 
all these aspects mean that a comprehensive 
picture cannot be derived from looking at the 
flows of goods alone. In relation to bilateral 
trade, a pure cross- comparison of imports and 
exports of goods and services can lead to a dis -
torted diagnosis if the input content of the sup -
plied products and the demand effects eman -
ating from non-  euro-  area countries are not 
taken into account as well. For that reason, 
economic research has devoted itself over the 
past few years to an in- depth analysis of inter -
national trade links on the basis of value added Changes in

Global input- output tables
Empirical research into value  added trade 
and global value chains is based largely on 
global input- output tables, which capture 
sectoral sourcing relationships at the global 
level. Global input- output tables are con-
structed by linking harmonised national input- output tables with disaggregated  bilateral trade data. Specifi  cally, fl  ows of goods between countries are assigned to the corresponding economic sectors and 
broken down into intermediates and fi  nal 
goods in line with their end use. Several 
 assumptions have to be made in this pro-
cess. For example, it is assumed that, within a given sector, imports of intermediates are distributed across the various sectors in pro-
portion to national input shares. In add-ition, the bilateral export and import data 
produced by the statistical offi   ces of various countries often differ from each other
1 and 
have to be reconciled for the preparation of global input- output tables.
The WIOD2 global input- output tables, 
which are readily available to the public, 
serve as a new, analytically meaningful and versatile database for studying international 
relationships between production and de-mand and the associated foreign trade. 
Among other things, they allow a detailed 
quantifi  cation of value  added trade along 
various dimensions, which used to be pos-
sible to a limited extent only in case studies. 
By linking global input- output tables with sectoral employment statistics and capital stock data, it is possible, for example, to 
 estimate the effects of structural changes in 
international trade on capital intensity and 
demand for labour by level of education.3 
With the help of global input- output tables, 
it is now also possible for the fi  rst time to 
analyse the effects of cross- border produc-
tion links on the price competitiveness of individual economies at a theoretical and 
empirical level.4
Looking to the future, the task remains to 
make global input- output tables for current 
years available to researchers and political 
decision- makers as quickly as possible and 
to further improve the quality of data. The 
assumptions necessary for the preparation of global input- output tables give rise to differences with regard to bilateral gross 
trade fl  ows, for example, between the offi   -
cial national statistics and the correspond-
ing data from the OECD or WIOD global 
input- output tables. Despite these statistical 
uncertainties, the results presented in this report can, however, be regarded as rela-tively robust in terms of the underlying 
trends they reveal.
1 According to the IMF’s WEO database, this resulted 
in a statistical trade surplus across all countries of just under 1% of global GDP in 2013.2 WIOD stands for World Input- Output Database.3 See M P Timmer, A A Erumban, B Los, R Stehrer and

flows.5 With regard to the euro area, the back -
ground to this was, not least, the question of 
why some economies were able to handle the 
competitive pressure stemming from globalisa-tion better than others. It proved to be an ad-
vantage for such studies that global input-  
output tables have become available recently. 
One source is the statistical basis created as 
part of an OECD-  WT O initiative. Another source 
is the data compiled by the WIOD6 project, 
which was funded by the European Commis -
sion. The latter were used for the analyses de -
scribed below.
Flows of goods versus 
 exchange of value added
The foreign trade statistics relate to the export 
and import of goods. Below, cross-  bor der trade 
in goods is considered in the same way as in 
the national accounts, ie including trade in ser -
vices.7 This broader definition captures the 
flows of income and expenditure associated 
with exports of goods and services. In this con -
text, it is irrelevant whether the goods are pro -
duced entirely or only partly in the country of 
origin.
The cross-  c ountry breakdown of production 
stages leads to international trade in intermedi-
ate goods. This means that direct trade flows 
between two countries allow only very limited 
conclusions to be drawn as to where abroad 
and to what degree domestic value added is 
ultimately absorbed. A country’s gross exports 
do not exclusively contain domestic value 
added insofar as imported inputs are incorpor -
ated into the exported final and intermediate 
goods. Conversely, the domestic value added 
contained in exported inputs is not necessarily absorbed by the importing country in final de -
mand. In this connection, double counting may occur in the foreign trade statistics.
8
Cross-  bor der flows of value added can be rep -
resented in either of two ways. Value added exports measure the part of domestic value added absorbed in final demand abroad. In 
other words, it is that part of domestic GDP 
which originates from consumption and invest -
ment decisions abroad. By contrast, the value 
added content of exports comprises the do -
mestic value added contained therein, irrespect -
ive of whether it is included in domestic final demand or crosses another border – possibly 
even into its country of origin – in the form of 
inputs or final goods. In the aggregate (ie for 
all trading partners combined) the two con -
cepts differ only in terms of reimports of do -
mestic value added, which are typically on a 
relatively small scale.
Of greater significance quantitatively is the dis -
tinction between value added exports and the 
value added content of exports in the context 
of studies of bilateral trade relationships. The 
regional profile of value added exports can be 
interpreted as the country-  specific distribution  
of the GDP effects of foreign trade in accord -
ance with its final use in the form of consump-
tion and investment. By contrast, comparing 
the value added content of bilateral gross trade 
flows provides indications of the actual flows 
of the value added contained in goods from 
their creation to their final absorption. From 
this, it is possible to derive close relationships 
with the relative position of economies in inter -
national value chains by comparing the num-ber of upstream production stages with the 
number of downstream production stages up Analysis of

Decomposition of bilateral gross trade balances into direct 
value added fl  ows and third- country effects
Surpluses and defi  cits in the cross- border 
trade of goods and services are often re-
garded as evidence of high or low competi-
tiveness. However, conclusions of this kind 
are inadequate, particularly when looking at relationships between countries or 
groups of countries, as bilateral gross trade 
balances and value added balances can 
sometimes deviate considerably from each 
other in the context of highly developed 
international production networks. Indeed, 
direct fl  ows of value added between two 
trading partners are not the only factor rele-
vant to bilateral foreign trade statistics, as 
third- country effects on the supply and de-mand side also play an important role.
The gross trade balance between two coun-
tries can be broken down according to the country of origin and country of end use of the value added. Overall, four components 
can be distinguished: the net value added of the two trading partners absorbed by fi  nal demand in one of the two trading partners (IW 
i) or in third countries ( IW a), 
and the net value added from third coun-
tries absorbed in fi  nal demand in one of the two trading partners (AW 
i) or in third coun-tries (AW a). IW i is largely the same as the 
bilateral value added balance, though not 
wholly identical to it. This is because double counting terms and re- imports are included in IW 
i but not in the value added balance, 
and also because value added fl  ows that af-
fect the value added balance can also be contained in the bilateral gross trade bal-ances of both trading partners with third 
countries.1 As a result of global value chains, 
demand in third countries therefore has a direct impact on the bilateral gross trade 
balances of other countries, as represented 
by the components IW a and AW a. For 
 example, demand in Spain can lead to an increase in Germany’s trade surplus with 
France if intermediate goods from Germany are imported by France and then processed there to satisfy fi  nal demand in Spain.
1 For example, in many cases the USA imports German 
value added via third countries, meaning that this part of the German value added balance with the USA does 
not appear in the bilateral fl  ows of goods between 
these two countries. See A J Nagengast and R Stehrer 
(2014), Collateral imbalances in intra- European trade?

Results for Germany
The effects of the increasing international 
division of labour are clearly evident in Ger-
many’s bilateral gross trade balances. For 
example, Germany’s gross trade balances with France, Italy and Spain all overstate 
Germany’s actual value added surplus. In all 
three cases this is primarily due to the fact 
that German goods contain a large propor-tion of foreign value added.
The German gross trade balance with most 
of the smaller euro- area countries is also 
higher than its value added balance. Des-pite this, Germany’s overall value added 
surplus vis- à- vis all euro- area partner coun-
tries exceeds its corresponding gross trade 
balance with these countries. The main rea-son for this is the existence of value added 
defi  cits with the Netherlands and Ireland 
that are signifi  cantly lower than the corres-ponding negative gross trade balances with 
these two countries. Notwithstanding stat-
istical uncertainties in the WIOD2 input- 
output tables, it is possible that third- 
country demand effects resulting from the 
seaport in Rotterdam and the decisions of international groups on where to base their headquarters (especially in the pharmaceut-icals industry) play a role here, pushing the 
German gross trade defi  cits with both 
countries signifi  cantly higher than the cor-
responding value added balances.
In light of the decomposition of gross trade 
balances to show foreign value added and 
third- country demand effects, the fact that 
the value added balance with euro- area 
partner countries exceeds the correspond-ing gross trade balance is attributable to two factors. First, euro- area countries do not import German value added solely in 
the form of direct imports, but also via third countries. Second, Germany imports inputs 
from the euro area in order to satisfy fi  nal 
demand in non- euro- area countries, there-
fore reducing the amount of value added 
from euro- area partner countries absorbed 
in Germany and thus captured in the value added balance. Demand in China, the USA 
and EU countries in central and eastern 
 Europe is most important in this context.

Germany’s value added balance with coun-
tries outside the euro area is lower than its 
corresponding gross trade surplus with these countries. This is because the differ-
ences between Germany’s gross trade bal-
ance and value added balance cancel each 
other out in the breakdown by euro- area countries and non- euro- area countries owing to consistency requirements. The  decomposition of the gross trade fi  gures shows that Germany exports a signifi  cant volume of value added from euro- area 
countries to third countries – above all from 
the Netherlands, France and Italy. This is 
partially offset by some domestic value added embedded in German exports to 
third countries being absorbed in the euro 
area – especially in France, Italy and Aus-
tria – though the fi  rst effect outweighs the 
second.
Germany’s value added balance with the 
USA surpasses its corresponding gross trade 
surplus and is therefore something of an ex-
ception. This is attributable to the fact that 
German value added embedded in aircraft 
or motor vehicles, for example, is often 
 exported from Germany to the USA via 
other countries as opposed to directly. The

United Kingdom, on the other hand, is 
lower than the bilateral gross trade balance, 
as indeed it is with most countries. Value 
added from third countries increases the German gross trade surplus with both the 
USA and the UK. The third- country demand effect, however, has a negative sign in both 
cases. This means that Germany has be-
come particularly specialised in downstream production steps for inputs traded with the 
USA and the UK destined for end use in 
third countries.
International tendencies
The analysis of a larger selection of coun-
tries facilitates an estimate of the average quantitative signifi  cance for international gross trade imbalances of the individual components of bilateral gross trade bal-ances. A variance decomposition of all bi-lateral gross trade balances between EU 
countries shows that value added balances are deviating more and more from bilateral 
fl  ows of goods. The proportion of value added from the direct trading partner ab-sorbed in fi  nal demand in one of the two 
trading partners (IW i) fell from an average 
of 60% for the years 1995-99 to an aver-
age of 44% for the years 2010-11. The next 
largest component, with an average of 
32%, was foreign value added absorbed by one of the two trading partners (AW 
i). The 
relative size of this component changed 
only marginally in the period under review. By contrast, strong dynamism can be seen, above all, in the growing signifi  cance of de-
mand in third countries ( IW a + AW a), 
whose share of value added absorption in-creased from 5% (1995-99) to 24% (2010-
11). Of this, an average of 19 percentage points were attributable to demand in countries outside of the EU in 2010 and 2011. This means that, as a result of de-mand in non- EU countries, bilateral gross trade balances between EU countries are usually slightly higher than corresponding 
value added balances.
The growing signifi  cance of third- country 
demand effects could in principle be attrib-
uted to changes in fi  nal demand in third 
countries, the increasing division of labour 
within international production networks 
and the value added share of individual sec-tors. A structural decomposition analysis in-dicates that changes in the level and struc-
ture of fi  nal demand accounted for just 
over one- third of this growth. The greatest contribution to the rise in the third- country 
demand effect, accounting for 14 percent-
age points of the change, was due to the increased fragmentation of production within the EU. A good example of this 
 development is the increasingly close recip-rocal trade relations between Germany and 
the EU member states in central and east-
ern Europe. The proportion of value added 
in German exports that is attributable to 
this group of countries increased markedly 
(1995: ½%, 2008: 2%), as did the propor-
tion of German value added embedded in 
exports from these countries (1995: 4½%; 
2008: 6½%). The increase in intra- European 
trade imbalances over the last decade is therefore not attributable solely to higher demand in Europe for European products, but also to growth momentum in third 
countries and the market- driven intensifi  ca-tion of international production links.Deutsche Bundesbank

to final demand.9 Effective tariff quotas in inter -
national value chains can be quantified by tak -
ing into account the fact that tariffs are charged 
on the nominal value of goods and that value 
added can be tariffed repeatedly as a result of 
borders being crossed multiple times (tariff 
magnification effect).10
In terms of assessing the relative attractiveness 
of production that is due to the primary factors 
of production, value added balances are better 
suited to comparing individual countries or 
groups of countries with each other than are 
gross trade balances, which contain a non-  
negligible percentage of foreign value added. 
In the same way as value added exports, value 
added balances are defined by the origin of 
value added and its absorption in final demand 
abroad. A comparison of the value added 
traded between two countries can differ con -
siderably from the income- expenditure balance 
in cross- border trade (see box on pages  33 
to 36). Nevertheless, in the aggregate across 
all trading partners, the value added balance is 
identical with the gross trade balance. This is 
due to the fact that imported inputs which are 
used to produce export goods appear on both 
the import and export side and therefore  cancel 
each other out on balance.
Value added analysis of 
 Germany’s foreign business
Germany’s value added exports accounted for 
an average of seven- tenths of export revenues 
in 2010 and 2011; in the second half of the 
1990s, this figure had stood at almost four-  
fifths (78%). The decline shows that purchases 
of foreign intermediates have clearly become 
more important for the domestic production of 
goods and services. The increasing integration 
of the German economy into the international 
division of labour does mean that, at present, 
only around 70 cents of every euro of revenue 
earned through foreign business is generated 
as domestic income, compared with 78 cents 
just under 20 years ago. At the same time, however, the current volume of exports would 
not be possible without the intensive use of 
 imported intermediates.
Taking the average of the years 2010 and 2011, 
the value added content of gross exports, at 
73%, was slightly higher than the correspond -
ing ratio for value added exports. Reimported 
value added for goods intended for end use in 
Germany (2 percentage points) or for goods 
that were reexported again (1 percentage 
point) – referred to in the literature as double 
counting – was also reflected here. The remain -
ing 27% was accounted for by foreign value 
added, which is embedded in goods that are 
produced domestically for export. Just under 
one- third of this amount was attributable to 
euro- area countries. The sound performance of 
German exporters therefore also benefited 
countries with upstream production stages in 
international value chains; in purely mathemat -
ical terms, GDP in these countries went up by 
an average of 20 cents for every euro of rev -
enue earned by German exporters.11 By the 
same token, Germany also benefited from the 
demand for foreign products, as German en -
terprises sometimes act as intermediaries in 
international value chains. Just under one-  
quarter of Germany’s value added exports were 
not absorbed by Germany’s direct trading part -
ners, but crossed at least one other inter -
national border before reaching the final con -
sumer.
The decline in the domestic value added con -
tent of exports is a global phenomenon that 
reflects how economies have become special -
ised in specific production stages, especially in 
those that are consistent with their domestic Gross trade 
 balances versus value added balances

factor endowments and their own comparative 
advantages. In the euro area (excluding Ger -
many), the domestic share of value added fell 
from an already low level in 1995 by a further 
6 percentage points to 68% in 2008, reflecting 
the close division of labour in the European 
production network. In Asia, the international -
isation process has been particularly dynamic 
over the past decade. Between 1995 and 2008, 
for example, the share of foreign value added 
in Chinese exports rose by more than 20 per -
centage points to one- third. More than 1 per -
centage point of this was accounted for by the 
increase in German value added. This under -
scores the growing importance of China as a 
production location for German enterprises, 
with high- quality intermediates often being im -
ported from Germany by their subsidiaries 
based there.12 Compared with other advanced 
economies, the interconnectedness of the Ger -
man economy is relatively pronounced. The 
USA, Japan and the UK, for example, posted a 
significantly lower foreign share of value added 
in gross exports in 2008 than Germany.
A bilateral assessment of German foreign trade 
shows that geographical distance has a clear 
influence on the intensity of international value 
chains, as trade in intermediate goods with 
neighbouring countries is particularly attractive 
owing to the low transport costs. Because of the high value added content of imported 
intermediates in exports, the national value 
added share of the flow of goods, especially 
between trading partners that are located close 
to one another, tends to be lower. On the 
whole, this results in shifts in the weights of 
Germany’s trading partners if the respective 
value added flows are considered instead of 
the revenues generated from goods and ser -
vices. In terms of value added, the euro- area 
countries are becoming much less important 
both on the export and the import side. By 
contrast, the USA is overtaking France as Ger -
many’s most important trading partner. Fur -
thermore, both Japan and China are gaining 
slightly in importance in terms of value added. 
In principle, preference should be given to 
value added- based trade weights when assess -
ing the consequences of real economic shocks 
abroad on the German economy, as these 
trade weights better reflect the final demand 
for German economic output.

Sectoral and product- specific 
export trends
The globalisation tendencies in the real econ -
omy have both a demand- side component re -
sulting from the offshoring of goods and a sup -
ply- side component resulting from the frag -
mentation of value chains. Whereas growth in 
the cross-  border trade in goods is driven by 
both components, the increase in the inter -
national exchange of services is primarily the 
result of the partitioning of production pro -
cesses. The weight of services in the global 
trade of goods has remained unchanged at 
one- fifth over the past 20 years. Even among 
the advanced economies, such as the euro 
area, the share of cross- border service flows 
has increased only marginally on a pro rata  
basis. It is therefore not surprising that there 
have been no notable shifts between merchan -
dise and services trade in the German econo -
my’s goods exports since the mid-1990s.In the German export business, 85% of rev -
enue –  and thus distinctly more than on an 
international average  – is accounted for by 
merchandise exports. This is due largely to the 
solid industrial basis of the German economy 
and the manufacturers’ strength on global 
markets. Well over one- third of revenue in Ger -
many’s manufacturing sector is accounted for 
by foreign business. Within the manufacturing 
sector, transport equipment is the most signifi -
cant subsector, accounting for a share of three- 
fifths. This is followed by machinery and equip -
ment, the chemical industry and electrical en -
gineering, all of which account for shares of 
between 40% and 50%. Outside of the indus -
trial sector, only the transport sector with a 
one- quarter share and the wholesale and retail 
sector with a one- eighth share account for 
double- digit export figures. In the other eco -
nomic sectors, by contrast, cross- border sales 
relationships play only a minor role. With the 
exception of construction and energy, which 
are still focused on the domestic markets, these Direct exports of

are the services sectors whose activities are ei -
ther not tradable at all or in some cases can 
only be offered to a limited extent on a direct 
cross- border basis owing, among other rea -
sons, to language barriers and country- specific 
requirements.
By contrast, the share of services value added 
contained in goods exports has become more 
significant. Taking the average for the economy 
as a whole, this share stood at 45% in 2008 
and was thus up by 6 percentage points on 
1995. In the manufacturing sector, the equiva -
lent share amounted to 35%, compared with 
29%, and in the manufacture of transport 
equipment it even almost reached 40%, com -
pared with 27% in 1995. Similar trends can 
also be observed in most other advanced econ -
omies. The growing share of services value 
added in exports implies that the quality of do -
mestic services and the costs involved in pro -
viding them are becoming increasingly import -
ant as components of the international com -
petitiveness of economies.
Furthermore, the analysis of the value added 
content of gross trade shows that the share of 
foreign value added in manufacturing sector 
exports has now reached more than one- third 
in some cases. This share has risen sharply since 
1995, especially in the chemical and metal-  working industries as well as in the manufac -
ture of transport equipment. In 2008, more 
than half of the imported intermediates in the 
manufacturing sector were exported again for 
end use abroad.
Looking at the contributions of the primary fac -
tors of production in global value chains, a 
comparatively strong intensification of capital 
for the German industry becomes apparent for 
the period from 1995 to 2008, which, in some 
cases, is significantly greater than the level ob -
served in other advanced economies. This re -
fers to the share of industrial value added, 
which can be attributed in mathematical terms 
to productive assets installed in Germany – irre -
spective of the production stage and thus the 
sectoral affiliation. Furthermore, the contribu -
tion of capital as a factor of production in the 
foreign share of value added is also likely to 
have risen with regard to a large number of 
German industrial products. In the case of 
products of German car manufacturers, the 
build- up of production capacities outside of 
Germany is in fact the most expansive item. It 
is clear that foreign investment plays an im -
portant role in creating competitive products 
and in consolidating their international com -
petitiveness. Although the contribution of highly

Conclusion
Analysis of foreign trade flows has gained in 
importance from an economic policy perspec -
tive owing to the assessment of the current ac -
count balance within the context of the Macro -
economic Imbalance Procedure. Imbalanced 
positions in cross- border trade are being dis -
cussed from the perspective of international 
competitiveness. In this connection, however, it 
is often more appropriate from a conceptual 
point of view to analyse the value added flows 
rather than the export and import revenues. 
Looking at the aggregate across all trading 
partners, the two concepts yield identical re -
sults. The greater the level of disaggregation at 
the country level, however, the greater the dif -
ferences may become. This is due to the supply 
and demand- side influences brought about by 
trade links with third countries. A glance at the 
breakdown of Germany’s foreign business with 
euro- area countries and non- euro- area coun -
tries shows that the gross trade and value 
added balances do not differ considerably from 
one another. Particularly, the trends that they 
exhibit are largely consistent. Thus, Germany’s 
value added surplus vis- à- vis its euro- area part -
ner countries, just like its gross trade balance, is 
likely to have declined substantially since 2007, 
whereas the surplus vis- à- vis its non- euro- area 
partner countries has increased significantly 
over the past few years.14
In cross- border trade with goods and services, 
imbalances between individual countries or re -
gions are nothing out of the ordinary. Gener -
ally, they reflect the global demand trends 
against the backdrop of the international div -
ision of labour, which is geared towards the 
relative advantages of the economies inte -
grated in the global economy. Thus, surpluses 
are to be interpreted as the result of a firmly established market position and favourable 
framework conditions. Rapid change is a char -
acteristic feature of globalised economic rela -
tions. This in itself facilitates the correction of 
imbalanced trading positions, provided that the 
economies which have fallen behind step up 
their adjustment efforts and the endogenous 
market forces can unfold their stabilising effect.
Foreign demand is of crucial importance for 
growth and prosperity for the German econ -
omy, the supply and demand- side potential of 
which is being increasingly affected by demo -
graphic factors. The export success over the 
past few years is an indication that German en -
terprises have, on the whole, undertaken the 
right strategic measures to enable them to hold 
their own on the global markets. The procure -
ment of imported intermediates as well as the Bilateral trade 
flows should also be analysed in terms of their value added content

Launch of the banking union:  
the Single Supervisory Mechanism in Europe
Europe’s Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) for banks will be launched on 4 November 2014. 
Whereas banking regulation, ie the development of binding rules regarding credit institutions’ 
conduct, has been closely harmonised for quite a long time already, especially at the EU level, the 
SSM is the first significant step towards greater communitisation of supervisory practice in Europe, 
ie the application of these rules as well as monitoring of compliance in individual cases. In future, 
the European Central Bank (ECB) will perform a pivotal function in supervising banks located in 
the euro area (and in non- euro- area EU member states that join the SSM voluntarily) and, in so 
doing, will work closely with national supervisory authorities.
The legal framework for the SSM, which governs responsibilities and the division of tasks between 
the ECB and national supervisors, was already adopted in 2013 and is now about to be put into 
operation following a one- year transitional period. In future, the ECB will be directly responsible 
for the supervision of 120 significant, major banks or banking groups, in close collaboration with 
national authorities. Joint supervisory teams (JSTs), comprising staff from the national authorities 
and the ECB and coordinated by the ECB, will play a key role in supervising significant banks. By 
contrast, medium- sized and small banks will remain, as before, under the direct supervision of the 
national authorities; however, the ECB can also lay down certain framework conditions for these 
institutions or, in some cases, intervene in supervision directly. The SSM is akin to a network in 
which national authorities and the ECB cooperate under the leadership of the ECB.
The SSM is part of the overall banking union project, the next step of which – envisaged from 
2016 onwards – will be a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for credit institutions in Europe. 
Healthy and robust banks are a key precondition for the successful launch of a banking union. To 
ensure this, all currently existing burdens and weaknesses at banks must be identified in a timely 
manner and rectified before responsibility for supervision is transferred to the European level. 
Since these “legacy debts” came into being under the supervision of the currently responsible 
national authorities, the respective countries are also still responsible for rectifying them, in keep -
ing with the principle of correlating liability with supervision.
To this end, the euro area’s largest banks have been subjected to a comprehensive assessment 
(CA) over the past few months. This CA included not only a review of a selection of banks’ 
balance- sheet and off- balance- sheet items (asset quality review, or AQR) but also stress tests 
which simulated potential crisis scenarios and assessed the attendant effects on institutions. The 
results will be published on 26 October 2014, a little over a week before the ECB assumes super -
visory responsibilities.Deutsche Bundesbank

Motivation to create 
the  Single Supervisory 
 Mechanism
On 29 June 2012, the euro- area Heads of State 
or Government came to a fundamental agree -
ment to establish a central banking supervisor 
based at the ECB for member states whose cur -
rency is the euro.1 Just under two- and- a- half 
years later, the plan, akin to an “organisational 
tour de force ”, will now become a reality: on 
4 November 2014, the ECB will assume respon -
sibility for supervising banks in the euro area, 
which will herald fundamental change – both 
institutional and organisational  – to current 
supervisory practice in Europe.
The SSM is also intended to break the vicious 
circle between banks and national finances, 
which played a major role in the crisis. The 
public funds used to rescue or prop up banks 
left, in some cases, sizeable holes in govern -
ment budgets. Unsound public finances, in 
turn, impacted adversely on banks, for example 
if they held sovereign debt on their books. The 
SSM will now take what had previously been 
purely national banking supervision to a Euro -
pean level, which will also minimise the haz -
ards of potentially inappropriate supervisory 
forbearance guided by national interests 
(known as “home bias”).
The move towards greater communitisation of 
banking supervision through the SSM, more -
over, reflects the highly integrated and finan -
cially interlinked nature of Europe’s financial 
markets. The idea behind the cross- border dis -
semination and comparison of information is 
also to detect risks engendered by, or which 
pose a hazard to, the banking system better 
and earlier. In addition, the SSM will offer 
supervisors entirely new vistas for their pruden -
tial supervisory work. Ideally, cooperation and 
the exchange of ideas and opinions across na -
tional borders may amalgamate the procedures 
and modi operandi  of the individual SSM mem -
ber countries’ national supervisory regimes and 
migrate them to the SSM’s institutional frame -work. The goal is ultimately to enhance the 
banking system’s resilience and safeguard eco -
nomic stability in the euro area.2
The SSM’s structures
The SSM’s scope
The Regulation conferring specific tasks on the 
European Central Bank concerning policies re -
lating to the prudential supervision of credit in -
stitutions entered into force on 3  November 
2013.3 It created the SSM, by means of which 
extensive banking supervisory powers will 
be conferred upon the ECB with effect from 
4 Novem ber 2014. The SSM’s remit will extend 
to all banks engaged in lending and deposit 
business, ie those banks classified as a deposit- 
taking credit institution under EU law. It will 
also cover credit institutions’ prudentially con -
solidated parent undertakings, including finan -
cial holding companies and mixed financial 
holding companies. Responsibility for con -
sumer protection and the prevention of money 
laundering or terrorist financing will not be 
transferred to the ECB but instead will remain 
wholly with  national supervisors. In these areas, 
however, the ECB, where appropriate, is to 
 cooperate fully with the national authorities 
to  ensure consumer protection and to fight 
money laundering.Europe’s Single

Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervi -
sion of credit institutions.Deutsche Bundesbank

The SSM’s geographical coverage will initially 
be limited to those EU countries whose cur -
rency is the euro. EU member states whose 
currency is not the euro can opt into the SSM 
by entering into close cooperation with the 
ECB. Only the future will tell to what extent the 
non- euro- area countries actually make use of 
this option.
Significant and less significant 
banks
Although the SSM Regulation confers upon the 
ECB responsibility for supervising all banks 
within the scope of the SSM, only those institu -
tions classified as significant will be supervised 
directly by the ECB. A large portion of supervis -
ory decision- making powers with respect to in -
stitutions classified as being less significant will 
initially remain with the national competent au -
thorities (NCAs). Moreover, there will also be 
common procedures4 which will be conducted 
irrespective of whether a bank is classified as 
significant or less significant.
Article 6 of the SSM Regulation sets forth the 
following criteria for classifying an institution as 
significant or less significant: size, importance 
for the economy of the Union or any participat -
ing member state, and significance of cross-  
border activities.
Measured by size and importance for the econ -
omy of the EU, an institution or group of insti -
tutions is currently deemed to be significant if 
the total value of its assets exceeds €30 billion 
or 20% of national GDP , unless the total value 
of its assets is less than €5 billion. A discretion -
ary decision to declare a bank to be significant 
may also be taken if an NCA considers an insti -
tution to be of significant relevance for its do -
mestic economy and the ECB confirms such 
significance. This decision is always taken at 
the highest level of consolidation for supervis -
ory purposes. The method applied to deter -
mine significance is fleshed out by the SSM Framework Regulation, which was published 
by the ECB on 25 April 2014.5
The ECB may also, on its own initiative, con -
sider an institution to be significant where it 
has established banking subsidiaries in more 
than one participating member state and its 
cross- border assets or liabilities represent a sig -
nificant part of its total assets or liabilities. The 
SSM Framework Regulation defines this criter -
ion more precisely to mean that significance on 
the basis of cross- border activities may be con -
sidered only if the ratio of an institution’s cross- 
border assets (or liabilities) to its total assets (or 
liabilities) is greater than 20%. Cross- border in 
this context means that the counterparty is a 
credit institution or other legal or natural per -
son located in a participating member state 
other than the member state in which the par -
ent undertaking of the relevant supervised 
group has its headquarters.
In addition, institutions which have requested 
or received direct public financial assistance 
from the European Financial Stability Facility 
(EFSF) or the European Stability Mechanism 
(ESM) are also classified as being significant. 
Moreover, the three most significant institu -
tions in a participating member state are classi -
fied as being significant. As it is incumbent 
upon the ECB to ensure the consistent applica -
tion of high supervisory standards, it may also, 
on its own initiative and in consultation with 
the appropriate NCA, classify an institution or 
group of institutions as significant. This is predi -
cated on the ECB believing it necessary to 
supervise directly such entities in order to 
achieve the goal of ensuring the consistent ap -
plication of high supervisory standards.Opt- in for non-

2014 establishing the framework for cooperation within 
the Single Supervisory Mechanism between the European 
Central Bank and national competent authorities and with 
national designated authorities (SSM Framework Regula -
tion) (ECB/ 2014/ 17).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

These are regarded as “either/or” criteria, ie 
only one of them has to be met for the institu -
tion to be classified as significant. Since signifi -
cance is determined at the highest level of con -
solidation, this means that institutions belong -
ing to a group are regarded as significant even 
if they per se  do not meet the criteria for clas -
sification as significant.
If an institution fulfils the criteria for classifica -
tion as significant, pursuant to Article 6 (4) of 
the SSM Regulation it may, owing to “particular 
circumstances”, nevertheless be considered as 
less significant on a discretionary basis and will 
therefore not be supervised directly by the ECB. 
Under the SSM Framework Regulation, “par -
ticular circumstances” exist where there are 
specific and factual circumstances that make 
the classification of a supervised entity as sig -
nificant inappropriate. However, this reverse 
exception should be applied only to case- by- 
case decisions and under strict interpretation of 
the term “particular circumstances”. Its aim is 
to avoid inconsistencies in the classification of 
an institution as significant taking into account 
the SSM’s objectives. This provision will be ap -
plied in Germany to the Wüstenrot group; even 
though the group fulfils the criteria for classifi -
cation as a significant supervised entity, direct 
supervision by the ECB does not appear appro -
priate owing to the group’s structure (banking 
group with a reinsurance company at its apex).
Beginning and end of 
 supervision by the ECB
The date on which the ECB will assume direct 
supervision of an institution or a group of insti -
tutions will be specified in an ECB decision. The 
institution will be notified of this decision at 
least one month prior to the date on which the 
ECB will assume direct supervision. In addition, 
the institution concerned will be given the op -
portunity to submit comments in writing prior 
to the adoption of such a decision.The ECB will generally review the classification 
of an institution as significant once a year. If, 
for three consecutive years, none of the criteria 
for classification as significant has been ful -
filled, the ECB will end its direct supervisory ac -
tivities. In such an event, the ECB will adopt a 
further decision stating the end date of direct 
supervision by the ECB of the institution in 
question. Here, too, the decision must be 
adopted by the ECB at least one month prior to 
the end of direct supervision, and the notified 
institution must be given the opportunity to 
comment.
The ECB has published a list with the names of 
all the institutions and groups of institutions 
that will be under its supervision.6 This list, 
which will be updated regularly by the ECB, 
also indicates which of the criteria for classify -
ing the institution or group of institutions as 
significant has been fulfilled. According to the 
list, with effect from 4  November 2014, the 
ECB will assume responsibility for the direct 
supervision of 120 group entities7 in the euro 
area, representing nearly 85% of the total 
assets of all euro- area banks. In Germany, the 
ECB will directly supervise 21 groups. The mem -
ber states’ NCAs will initially retain responsibil -
ity for the direct supervision of the approxi -
mately 3,600 less significant banks in the euro 
area. This figure includes some 1,700 German 
institutions, which will continue to be super -
vised directly by the Federal Financial Supervis -
ory Authority (BaFin) and the Deutsche Bundes -
bank.Classification

The SSM’s governance 
 structures
Developing the future decision- making struc -
tures has probably been one of the greatest 
challenges in establishing the SSM. European 
legislators and the ECB faced the task of fitting 
the new supervisory powers into the ECB’s in -
stitutional framework in such a manner as to 
avoid, as far as possible, conflicts of aims and 
interests between banking supervision and 
monetary policy. The clear separation of these 
two areas is mandated by the SSM Regulation 
(see eg recitals 65 and 73 and Article 25). The 
ECB’s dual role as a central bank and supreme 
supervisory authority is an example of a situ -
ation that could possibly give rise to a conflict 
of interests. Its primary mandate is to ensure 
price stability in the euro area. To this end, it 
can provide banks with liquidity by means of 
monetary instruments. In its added role as a 
supervisor, the ECB will now run the risk of 
reputational damage should one of the institu -tions it supervises fail. It could, therefore, be 
tempted to use monetary liquidity instruments 
to prop up a bank which is actually no longer 
viable from a prudential point of view, even if 
monetary policy considerations, especially the 
objective of maintaining price stability, suggest 
that such action should be avoided.
However, the necessary strict separation of 
monetary policy and banking supervision is not 
possible under European primary law, accord -
ing to which the Governing Council of the ECB 
is explicitly mandated to serve as the supreme 
decision- making body. The fact that ultimate 
responsibility for both policy areas rests with 
the ECB Governing Council is not something 
that the SSM Regulation, which is part of Euro -
pean secondary legislation, can override. 
Against this background, the SSM’s govern -
ance structures as they now exist can, there -
fore, be seen only as a necessary compromise Danger of con-
flicts of interests between bank-ing supervision and monetary policy would  require 
 institutional 
 separation …… which, how-
ever, cannot be

and not as an ideal solution.8 The latter could 
be achieved only through a corresponding 
amendment to primary law.
Even in the area of banking supervision, there -
fore, the ECB’s Governing Council will act as 
the supreme decision- making body. In order to 
ensure the maximum possible degree of separ -
ation between supervisory and monetary policy 
decisions, the Governing Council of the ECB 
will hold separate SSM meetings alongside 
those on monetary policy issues – yet the com -
position will remain the same.9
A key role will be played, however, by the new 
Supervisory Board, which is to undertake “fully” 
the planning and execution of the supervisory 
tasks conferred upon the ECB. This Board will 
also give those non-  euro-  area member states 
opting into the SSM the opportunity to take 
part in the supervisory decision- making pro -
cess. By contrast, under the current EU Treaties, 
voting membership of the ECB’s supreme deci -
sion- making body, the Governing Council, is 
restricted to the presidents and governors of 
the central banks of those member states 
whose currency is the euro. The Supervisory 
Board will propose to the ECB Governing Coun -
cil draft decisions on individual supervisory 
measures for adoption by the Governing Coun -
cil. Under the “non- objection procedure”, a 
draft decision will be deemed adopted if the 
Governing Council does not object within a 
maximum period of ten working days.
The Supervisory Board is composed of its Chair, 
Vice- Chair, four ECB representatives and one 
representative of each participating member 
state’s NCA. Where the NCA is not a national 
central bank (NCB), the NCA may decide to 
bring a representative from its respective NCB 
to the Supervisory Board meetings. For the pur -
poses of the voting procedure, however, the 
representatives of the authorities of any one 
member state will together be considered as 
one member. This provision will apply to Ger -
many, since BaFin is given as the country’s 
NCA. At the same time, based on a division of tasks which has been in practice for years, the 
Bundesbank is closely involved in hands- on 
supervisory activities – through both off- site 
supervision and, in particular, on- site inspec -
tions. It would, therefore, be virtually unjus-
tifiable not to involve the Bundesbank, the 
President of which is a member of the ECB’s 
supreme decision- making body – the Govern -
ing Council – in the work of the preparatory 
body.
The Supervisory Board’s work is supported by a 
secretariat and a steering committee. The latter 
is composed of a “subset” of members of the 
Supervisory Board. Its task is to prepare Super -
visory Board meetings and support its general 
work.
The Supervisory Board held its inaugural meet -
ing in January 2014. Ms Danièle Nouy was ap -
pointed as the Chair of the Board, and the pos -
ition of Vice-  Chair went to Ms Sabine Lauten -
schläger, a former Deputy President of the 
Deutsche Bundesbank and currently a member 
of the Executive Board of the ECB.
The mediation panel stipulated in Article 25 (5) 
of the SSM Regulation is another means by 
which to ensure the separation of monetary 
policy and supervisory tasks. It will be called 
upon when the NCAs of the member states 
concerned express differences of views regard -
ing objections of the Governing Council of the 
ECB to a draft decision by the Supervisory 
Board. The mediation panel comprises one 
member per participating member state, 
chosen by each member state among its mem -
bers of the Governing Council of the ECB and 
the Supervisory Board. The Vice- Chair of the 
Supervisory Board will initially chair the meet -
ings of the mediation panel, but without hav -
ing voting rights. Opinions adopted by the New Supervisory 
Board is core component of SSM’s institu-tional structure

 mediation panel cannot, however, be binding 
on the Governing Council of the ECB as it is the 
supreme decision- making body.
The Administrative Board of Review is an add -
itional body established pursuant to Article 24 
of the SSM Regulation. It is composed of five 
individuals of high repute from member states. 
These individuals must have a proven record of 
relevant knowledge and professional experi -
ence, including supervisory experience. Fur -
thermore, they may not be current staff mem -
bers of the ECB, the NCAs or other institutions 
involved in carrying out tasks in connection 
with the SSM. On 8 September 2014, the Gov -
erning Council of the ECB appointed the five 
members and two alternates for the Adminis -
trative Board of Review’s first term of office. 
They include a former member of the Deutsche 
Bundesbank’s Executive Board, Edgar Meister.10 
In substance, the members are to review both 
the procedural and substantive legality of the 
supervisory decisions taken with respect to the 
provisions of the SSM Regulation. The Adminis -
trative Board of Review can be called upon by 
any natural or legal person to whom an ECB 
supervisory decision is addressed or for whom 
a supervisory decision is of direct or individual 
concern. After ruling on the admissibility of the 
request, the Administrative Board of Review 
must express an opinion within a certain 
period. This period should be appropriate to 
the urgency of the matter, but may not exceed 
two months from receipt of the request. The 
opinion will then be remitted to the Supervis -
ory Board and will serve as the basis for prepar -
ing a new draft decision. The new decision will 
abrogate or replace the previous decision. An 
appeal to the Administrative Board of Review is 
without prejudice to the right to bring pro -
ceedings before the European Court of Justice 
(ECJ), nor is it a precondition for bringing a 
case before the ECJ.
Four additional organisational units have been 
created within the ECB to deal with operational 
supervisory activities. They are called Director -
ates General (DGs) in line with the ECB’s stand -ard terminology, and are each responsible for 
certain supervisory tasks (see the chart on 
page 50).
Practical working methods 
in the SSM
As already mentioned, the ECB will assume 
 responsibility for the direct supervision of 120 
significant group entities in the euro area on 
4 November 2014. In Germany, 21 institutions 
will be affected. However, despite the creation 
of four Directorates General with approximately 
800 members of staff at present, the ECB does 
not have the capacity to exercise supervision 
over these groups single- handedly. For this rea -
son, Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) composed 
of staff appointed by the NCAs will be estab -
lished. This means that the national authorities 
will continue to play a major role in future. By 
performing analyses and collecting data, they 
will remain involved in the banking supervision 
of significant banks. Their supervisory acquis  
and wealth of experience will be particularly 
relevant to the ECB in those cases in which it 
must apply national law. This holds true primar -
ily with regard to EU directives, which must be 
transposed into national law by each member 
state. Furthermore, in its daily communication 
with the supervised banks, the ECB can make 
use of the benefits derived from collaboration 
with native speakers in the relevant JSTs.
Less significant banks will remain largely under 
the supervision of the NCAs. While the ECB will 
not be able to issue specific instructions in this 
area, it will perform a supervisory function for 
the entire system owing to the responsibility 
for oversight conferred upon it. However, the 
ECB will have the option, following consult -
ation with the relevant NCA, of taking over 
complete responsibility from the NCA for super -
vision of a less significant bank if it considers Administrative 
Board of Review responsible for extrajudicial remedies

this necessary to ensure the consistent applica -
tion of high supervisory standards.
In Germany, BaFin exercises supervision of all 
institutions in cooperation with the Bundes -
bank. Although BaFin has NCA status, the Bun -
desbank is involved in the ongoing monitoring 
of the institutions under national law. It thus 
has the status of a central bank with supervis -
ory duties which is not an NCA. More than 
1,300 members of the Bundesbank’s staff are 
currently involved in banking supervision, 
evaluating notifications and reports submitted 
by the institutions, conducting supervisory dis -
cussions with bank management and perform -
ing on- site inspections, particularly in the areas 
of risk management and approval of internal 
models. BaFin is responsible for sovereign deci -
sions in the form of supervisory measures, 
which it implements, inter alia,  on the basis of 
the Bundesbank’s work. Additionally, BaFin has 
responsibility for supervising financial services 
institutions and payment services providers, 
and for consumer protection. Its responsibilities 
for the latter areas are not affected by the SSM 
Regulation, however. This tried and tested div -
ision of duties between BaFin and the Bundes -
bank should continue with regard to the SSM 
as well – directly in relation to less significant 
banks and via JSTs in the case of significant in -
stitutions.Joint Supervisory Teams
To ensure that the national supervisory author -
ities are adequately involved in the supervision 
of significant banks, a JST consisting of ECB 
and NCA staff will be established for each of 
these institutions. The JSTs will be supported in 
their duties by the ECB’s horizontal and special -
ised services and the NCAs.
Every team will be headed by a JST coordinator 
appointed by the ECB. Each NCA represented 
in the JST will designate a sub- coordinator, 
who should act as a link to the relevant NCAs.
A core JST comprising the ECB coordinator and 
the national sub-  coordinators will perform a 
steering function for the JST concerned in order 
to enable greater efficiency in decision- making. 
Its aim will be to amalgamate the potentially 
differing views of the JST members. The core 
JST will organise the distribution of tasks among 
the JST members, draft and review the inspec -
tion plan and monitor its implementation. In 
Germany, both BaFin and the Bundesbank will 
appoint sub- coordinators for the JSTs.
The composition of the JSTs will depend chiefly 
on the significance, complexity, business model 
and risk profile of the supervised institution.

 reflect a supervised institution’s share of busi -
ness activities in the individual SSM member 
states. As a general rule, a consolidated super -
visory approach will be applied for the supervi -
sion of a cross- border banking group by the 
responsible JST. This means that just one JST 
will be established, consisting of ECB staff, staff 
of the NCA that supervises the parent under -
taking, and staff of the NCA(s) responsible for 
supervising the subsidiaries (see the adjacent 
chart).
The JSTs will be responsible for implementing 
guidance issued by the ECB Governing Council 
and the Supervisory Board. Within the decision- 
making process, the JSTs will be tasked with 
preparing draft decisions and coordinating 
them with the ECB’s Directorates General and 
the horizontal services. The Supervisory Board 
will subsequently review the drafts and decide 
on the proposals to be passed on to the Gov -
erning Council of the ECB for a final decision.
As part of ongoing supervisory activities, the 
JSTs will also be in charge of preparing and or -
ganising the annual supervisory examination 
programme and of the operational supervision 
of all banks subject to direct ECB supervision on 
a consolidated, sub- consolidated and single-  
entity level. These tasks include a broad range 
of processes, such as procuring information, 
assessing risk, preparing the supervisory review 
and evaluation process (SREP), performing ad 
hoc analyses, assisting in policy work and regu -
latory projects, evaluating recovery plans and 
processing formal authorisation requests. In 
addition, the JSTs will be involved in approving 
internal models, will participate in crisis man -
agement meetings and will be integrated into 
colleges of supervisors.
On- site inspections of significant banks will be 
commissioned and coordinated by the compe -
tent JST and – from an overarching perspec -
tive – by the ECB’s Directorate General Micro-  
Prudential Supervision IV. NCA and ECB staff 
members, one of which will be designated as team leader by the ECB, will also be involved in 
on- site inspections.
120 JSTs – that is, one JST for each group entity 
under direct ECB supervision – have been es -
tablished to come into operation when the 
SSM assumes supervisory responsibility on 
4 November 2014. Supervisors from BaFin and 
the Bundesbank are involved in 34 JSTs, of 
which 21 will deal with German SSM institu -
tions and 13 with German subsidiaries of non- 
German SSM institutions.

methods and processes which have been de -
veloped from the experiences of the euro- area 
supervisory authorities and aim to ensure a 
stable and functioning banking system.
The Supervisory Manual describes the proced -
ures for cooperation and decision- making 
within the SSM, with the interplay between 
centralised processes and decentralised sup -
port being assigned a key role. Cooperation 
with authorities outside the SSM relates both 
to cooperation with other national, European 
and international authorities and cooperation 
within colleges of supervisors.
The Manual also addresses the on- site inspec -
tion methods, the SSM risk assessment system 
and the supervisory review and evaluation pro -
cess. These approaches are described in detail, 
while the annex provides supplementary infor -
mation, particularly about on- site inspections. 
Since these are core supervisory processes, the 
aim is to achieve the greatest possible degree 
of harmonisation in the procedures and to es -
tablish a clear framework for subsequent super -
visory measures taking into account the prin -
ciple of proportionality.
The supervisory review and evaluation process 
plays a key role in achieving efficient and con -
sistent supervisory outcomes. It is based mainly 
on two pillars: an institution’s risk assessment 
and, in a second step, the methodology for 
 determining the capital and liquidity levels 
 required. The risk assessment should be seen as 
a forward- looking, overriding and continual as -
sessment of an institution’s risk profile and 
should use both quantitative and qualitative 
 information. After all of the data collected dur -
ing this process have been evaluated, an 
 assessment will be carried out as to whether 
the institution has adequate levels of capital 
and liquidity and, possibly, whether supervisory 
measures must be taken. In practice, the moni -
toring of the requirements and indicators as 
well as the documentation of this process will 
be incumbent upon the competent JST.ECB’s supervisory procedures
With respect to the law of administrative pro -
cedure to be applied to supervisory procedures 
within the SSM, a distinction must be made 
 between NCA and ECB procedures.
NCA procedures will be particularly relevant in 
the case of less significant banks, where the 
power to issue prudential acts will remain with 
the NCA. Depending on the scenario, however, 
an NCA will also be able to issue a legal instru -
ment in relation to a significant institution, for 
example, if it is instructed to do so by the ECB 
(Article 9 (1) subsection 3 of the SSM Regula -
tion, Article 22 of the SSM Framework Regula -
tion), or where the necessary powers have not 
or could not be conferred upon the ECB by the 
SSM Regulation.
Where the NCAs perform prudential supervis -
ory functions, administrative procedures will be 
deemed to be national and will be based on 
the provisions of the relevant national adminis -
trative legislation. In Germany, this is governed 
primarily by the Federal Act on Administrative 
Procedures (Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz),  
which applies to the work carried out by both 
BaFin and the Bundesbank.
The situation is different where it concerns a 
procedure to issue prudential acts through the 
ECB itself – something that will be particularly 
relevant in the case of significant banks. Here, 
the application of national laws of administra -
tive procedure will not be an option as Euro -
pean authorities’ procedures are governed only 
by European law. The principles of administra -
tive legislation laid down in European law will, 
therefore, apply. Although these principles are 
not, unlike in Germany, codified in a centralised 
document, they result from the unwritten gen -
eral legal principles that are accepted as the 
legal source of European law and which were 
developed and formulated from ECJ rulings 
over many years. Against this background, the 
comment occasionally brought forward that 
there is no “European administrative law” is in -Supervisory

accurate, since legally binding provisions for 
the administrative actions of European bodies 
certainly do exist in the context of European 
primary law or the unwritten legal principles. 
Notable examples here are the right to be 
heard or the right to access files.
These provisions of European law are defined 
more precisely in the SSM Framework Regula -
tion, which the ECB itself has issued, and put 
into operation for the purposes of supervisory 
work within the SSM. For example, it respects 
the right of parties in a procedure – these are 
primarily institutions that have made an appli -
cation to the ECB or to which a supervisory de -
cision is to be addressed – to have access to 
the ECB’s file, subject to consideration of both 
the legitimate interests of third parties to pro -
tect their business secrets and the protection of 
confidential information (Article 32 of the SSM 
Framework Regulation). The right to be heard 
is also protected, but in cases in which an 
 urgent decision appears necessary in order to 
prevent significant damage to the financial sys -
tem, the hearing can be postponed until after 
the decision has been adopted. Depending on 
the matter in question, the ECB also has the 
scope to determine the time limit for a hearing 
as well as the form that the hearing will take 
(for instance, a written comment by the party 
or an oral hearing in a meeting). The details are 
stipulated in Article 31 of the SSM Framework 
Regulation.
A differentiated language regime has been 
 developed to resolve the language issue. The 
difficulty in this matter arises primarily from the 
conflict between two opposing objectives. On 
the one hand, there is the desire for efficient, 
smooth supervision within the SSM, including 
cooperation between the participating author -
ities, which would suggest that a single Europe- 
wide language should be used in supervisory 
procedures. On the other hand, there is the 
principle – reflecting the polyglot character of 
the EU  – that the Charter of Fundamental 
Rights respects the diversity of languages in 
Europe and accordingly guarantees the right to address EU bodies in any of the EU’s 24 official 
languages and to receive an answer in that 
same language (Article 41 (4) of the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights). In line with this, the SSM 
Framework Agreement allows for documents 
sent to the ECB as part of ECB supervisory pro -
cedures to be drafted in any of the official lan -
guages of the EU. However, the participants in 
a supervisory procedure can agree to use exclu -
sively one specific official EU language in their 
communication; from the point of view of effi -
cient administration, English – the ECB’s work -
ing language – would seem particularly appro -
priate. It is not obligatory to reach such agree -
ments, however. Credit institutions can, there -
fore, insist on communicating with the ECB in 
their respective national languages without this 
possibly placing them at a disadvantage. It 
 remains to be seen whether this model will 
 become established or whether participants 
will, in fact, effectively feel pressured to use 
English in everyday practice within the SSM.
The abovementioned fundamental guarantee 
of the right to freely choose the official lan -
guage used applies only to the relationship 
 between EU members and EU bodies. Accord -
ingly, the ECB and NCAs are free to adopt their 
own arrangements regarding the languages to 
be used between themselves (Article 23 of 
the SSM Framework Regulation). The practice 
 established thus far during the preparatory 
work for the SSM suggests that the vast 
 majority of communication between the SSM 
 authorities will take place in English. The situ -
ation will be different for administrative pro -
cedures that the NCAs conduct on their own 
responsibility under national law, particularly 
with regard to less significant banks. Here, the 
procedural rules under national law will con -
tinue to be adhered to, which in Germany pro -
vide for the use of German (section 23 of the 
Act on Administrative Procedures).European

ECB’s investigatory powers
To fulfil its supervisory responsibilities, the ECB 
will be entitled to access findings and analyses 
that already exist at the national level or are 
made available through data collection. How -
ever, given its responsibility for significant banks 
in particular, the ECB will not be able to rely 
solely on data supplied by the competent 
 authorities. Articles 10 to 13 of the SSM Regu -
lation thus set out separate investigatory 
powers, which – as provisions in an EU regula -
tion – will be directly applicable in the partici -
pating member states. In functional terms, 
 albeit not in all details of the requirements and 
areas of application, these powers correspond 
to the powers which have already been avail -
able to BaFin under section 44 of the German 
Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz)  for a long 
time, with the Bundesbank carrying out fact-  
finding activities on BaFin’s behalf in accord -
ance with the division of tasks enshrined in 
German law. The Bundesbank performs this 
task as part of its responsibilities for off-  site 
supervision as well as through the on-  site 
 inspections it conducts on BaFin’s behalf.
Article 10 invests the ECB with sweeping rights 
to access information. The ECB will be entitled 
to request all information that it needs to carry 
out the tasks conferred upon it by the SSM 
Regulation – not just from the credit institu -
tions or other supervised entities themselves, 
but also from the entities’ employees or from 
third parties to whom the supervised entities 
have outsourced functions or activities. The 
ECB will thus also have the right, for example, 
to request information from employees of 
banks or service providers to which certain 
bank activities have been outsourced. Any 
existing statutory or professional secrecy re -
quirements will not exempt these parties from 
the duty to supply information, thus ensuring 
that supervisors have full access to the data 
they need. Once the supervisors have accessed 
this information, however, the data will be sub -
ject to confidentiality requirements vis- à- vis 
third parties. Article 27 of the SSM Regulation sets out these requirements in relation to the 
ECB’s supervisory duties, making reference to 
other legal acts.
Article 11 of the SSM Regulation contains fur -
ther provisions on investigatory powers. It de -
fines in detail the possibilities provided for but 
left open in Article 10 allowing the ECB to carry 
out investigations for supervisory purposes. The 
ECB will be entitled to require the submission 
of documents, examine and take copies or 
 extracts of books and records and obtain writ -
ten or oral explanations from persons obliged 
to provide information. The ECB will also have 
the right to interview any other person not 
 specified in Article 10. To do so, it will have to 
obtain the consent of this person – who is not 
obliged to provide information per se –  but not 
that of the supervised entity, which will not 
have any rights of forbearance with regard to 
the interviewing of the person concerned.
In most cases, the aforementioned investiga -
tory powers will be exercised by supervisors 
 engaged in off- site activities rather than on the 
business premises of the supervised bank. 
However, the SSM provides for the additional 
option of performing on- site inspections (on 
the bank’s premises). An on- site inspection 
team will be formed for this purpose. On the 
basis of an inspection mandate issued by the 
ECB, this team will carry out an inspection on 
the bank’s premises for a limited period, which 
may, for example, involve examining docu -
ments and internal organisational and govern -
ance structures, as well as assessing the entity’s 
day- to- day processes. The SSM Regulation (Art -
icle  12) thus invests the ECB with powers to 
conduct such on- site inspections – where 
 necessary, even without the usual prior an -
nouncement to the bank in question. From a 
legal point of view, an on- site inspection man -
dated on the basis of this provision will be an 
ECB inspection rather than an NCA one despite 
the fact that the ECB will include NCA staff in 
its inspection teams, if only for resource rea -
sons. To prevent a “home bias” among super -
visors and encourage the development of co -SSM Regulation

herent, consistent supervisory practices across 
the participating member states, supervisors 
from other member states will also be drafted 
into the inspection teams on a rotating basis, 
thus adding a cross-  border perspective to the 
day- to- day work of the on- site supervisors.
The ECB, like the EU in general, does not have 
its own enforcement officers to avert any ob -
structions to the conduct of its investigations. 
The SSM Regulation therefore obliges the na -
tional authorities – probably the national police 
authorities in particular – to afford the neces -
sary administrative assistance to support the 
ECB and prevent any resistance to its measures 
(Article 11 (2)). Although the SSM Regulation 
respects national requirements for authorisa -
tion by a judicial authority, which are particu -
larly likely to apply when entering and search -
ing business premises as part of an on- site in -
spection, the national judicial authority will 
solely be entitled to control that the decision of 
the ECB is authentic and that the coercive 
measures envisaged are neither arbitrary nor 
excessive having regard to the subject matter 
of the inspection. The national judicial author -
ity will not be entitled to review the necessity 
for the inspection or demand to be provided 
with the information on the ECB’s file (Art -
icle 13 of the SSM Regulation).
Administrative penalties
European banking supervision would be nei -
ther credible nor effective if the ECB did not 
also have effectual instruments for penalising 
breaches of supervisory law and thus for enfor -
cing compliance with the law. Article 18 of the 
SSM Regulation thus provides the ECB with 
powers to impose administrative penalties. 
These penalties are comparable in function to 
the fines imposed under the German legislation 
on administrative offences, as they are pecuni -
ary penalties which are imposed by the super -
visory authority itself and not by a court.The key prerequisite for the ECB to impose an 
administrative penalty is for an entity to inten -
tionally or negligently breach a requirement 
under directly applicable acts of EU law (par -
ticularly regulations) in relation to which ad -
ministrative pecuniary penalties are made avail -
able to competent authorities under the rele -
vant EU law. The SSM Regulation thus does not 
define any new offences to be penalised but 
requires a stipulation in other acts of law to 
have been breached. However, it does make it 
clear that the powers to impose penalties, 
which have their legal grounding elsewhere, 
will now be transferred to the ECB. Nonethe -
less, the ECB’s powers in this area will be con -
fined to imposing penalties on credit institu -
tions, financial holding companies or mixed 
 financial holding companies; it will not be au -
thorised to impose penalties on other legal or 
natural persons (see also recital 53 of the SSM 
Regulation). The reason for this restriction is 
likely to be that any powers to impose penal -
ties beyond the group of supervised entities 
would encroach upon the areas of general 
criminal law and legislation on administrative 
offences, which, according to the division of 
powers within the EU, largely remain the pre -
serve of the member states.
Even so, these restrictions do not necessarily 
mean that breaches of law which the ECB does 
not have the power to penalise will inevitably 
go unpunished. The SSM Regulation (Article 18 
(5)) stipulates that the ECB may require NCAs to 
open proceedings with a view to taking action 
to ensure that appropriate penalties are im -
posed. In this way, offences requiring the im -
position of penalties already defined in national 
law can be used for the purposes of the SSM. 
According to the wording of the SSM Regula -
tion, this procedure is intended, above all, for 
breaches of directives and penalties to be im -
posed on natural persons, such as members of 
the management board of a bank. The corres -
ponding measures are to be imposed in ac -
cordance with national legislation. In Germany, 
this could involve, in particular, administrative 
offence proceedings brought by BaFin, which Member states

may result in a fine. However, the SSM Regula -
tion does not confine this possibility to the im -
position of penalties by the NCA itself but also 
entitles the ECB to require the NCA to open 
proceedings. Consequently, in the member 
states in which an NCA is permitted to initiate 
criminal proceedings, the ECB could require 
that the NCA do so. In Germany, this possibility 
is unlikely to be relevant, however, as under the 
German law of criminal procedure BaFin is not 
deemed to be a criminal prosecution authority 
and thus cannot initiate criminal proceedings 
itself.
One noteworthy provision from the perspective 
of German legislation on administrative of -
fences relates to the criteria used to determine 
the size of a fine. Under German law, the size 
of a fine traditionally depends on the severity 
of the administrative offence and the accus -
ation levelled at the perpetrator; the financial 
circumstances of the perpetrator are merely an 
additional consideration (section 17 of the Ad -ministrative Offences Act (Ordnungswidrigkei -
tengesetz) ). By contrast, the SSM Regulation 
requires that penalties – whether imposed by 
national authorities or by the ECB – be effect -
ive, proportionate and dissuasive, thus giving 
general deterrence a more prominent role. The 
upper limit for pecuniary penalties imposed by 
the ECB will be twice the amount of the profits 
gained or losses avoided because of the breach 
where these can be determined, or up to 10% 
of the total annual turnover in the consolidated 
annual financial accounts of the group’s ultim -
ate parent undertaking. Where breaches are 
severe, this could lead to significantly higher 
absolute penalties than have usually been im -
posed under German legislation on administra -
tive offences to date. However, these fines are 
not a means for entities to buy their way out of 
prudential requirements they dislike; paying a 
fine will not free institutions from their obliga -
tion to act in accordance with the law as it 
stands.Criteria for

The law to be applied in penalty proceedings 
will depend on whether the proceedings are 
being conducted by the ECB itself or whether 
they have been initiated by a national authority 
on the ECB’s instructions. In the latter case, 
 national law will apply; in Germany, this means 
predominantly the Administrative Offences Act, 
much of which refers to the provisions of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessord -
nung).  In the former case, EU law in the form 
of Regulation (EC) No 2532/ 98 will apply. This 
Regulation, which was enacted when the ECB 
was established and has since been amended 
several times, governs the ECB’s powers to im -
pose sanctions. Up to now, this procedure has 
applied mainly to areas relating to minimum re -
serve requirements and statistical reporting ob -
ligations, where the ECB has had its own 
powers to impose sanctions for some time. 
With the creation of the SSM, the scope of this 
procedure will now be extended to include the 
area of banking supervision. The aforemen -
tioned Regulation contains provisions to pro -
tect the rights of the affected party, particularly 
the right to be heard. Decisions regarding sanc -
tions will be adopted by the Executive Board of 
the ECB, although the undertaking concerned 
will have the right to request a review of the 
decision by the Governing Council of the ECB. 
The right to a judicial review by the ECJ will 
 remain unaffected. The right to take the deci -
sion to initiate an infringement procedure will 
expire one year after the existence of the 
 alleged infringement first becomes known 
 either to the ECB or the NCB or, at the latest, 
five years after the infringement occurred.
Common procedures
The aforementioned division of tasks between 
the ECB and the NCA, which is based on 
whether or not an entity is classified as signifi -
cant, will not apply to three areas. In these 
areas, the ECB and the NCA will jointly imple -
ment “common procedures” which apply to all 
entities, regardless of whether they are classi -
fied as significant or less significant.The most important common procedure will re -
late to decisions on authorisation to take up the 
business of a credit institution. Authorisation 
has already been required for such activities for 
a long time. While the appropriate authorisa -
tion has been granted by NCAs until now, the 
ECB will have sole responsibility for granting au -
thorisation in future. However, applications for 
authorisation will have to be submitted to the 
relevant NCA. The NCA will then assess whether 
the applicant complies with all conditions for 
authorisation laid down in the relevant national 
law – which may go beyond the requirements 
under EU law. If so, the NCA will submit a draft 
decision to the ECB proposing that the ECB 
grant the applicant authorisation to take up the 
business of a credit institution. Nonetheless, the 
ECB will further assess the application on the 
basis of the conditions for authorisation laid 
down in substantive European law (particularly

investment firms (CRD IV)) and will take the final 
decision on whether an application for author -
isation is to be accepted or rejected (details are 
set out in Articles 73 to 79 of the SSM Frame -
work Regulation).
In a similar vein, a second common procedure 
will deal with the withdrawal of an authorisa -
tion, also through cooperation between the 
NCA and the ECB. Any NCA will be able to pro -
pose the withdrawal of an authorisation, based 
on either national or European law (Article 80 
of the SSM Framework Regulation), although 
here, too, the ECB will take the final decision 
on whether to follow this proposal. The ECB 
will also be able to initiate a withdrawal of au -
thorisation procedure on its own initiative; in 
such cases, it will be obliged to consult with 
the relevant NCA but, again, will ultimately 
have the final say.
The third common procedure will apply to the 
area of qualifying holdings. European law al -
ready requires any natural or legal person, or 
several such persons acting in concert, wishing 
to acquire a qualifying holding in a credit insti -
tution to notify the NCA in advance. A qualify -
ing holding is defined as a holding in an under -
taking which represents 10% or more of the 
capital or voting rights or which makes it pos -
sible to exercise a significant influence over the 
management of that undertaking. Although no 
authorisation is needed to acquire a qualifying 
holding, the supervisory authority is entitled to 
forbid the acquisition within 60 working days. 
Under the SSM, notification of an intention to 
acquire a qualifying holding in a credit institu -
tion will still have to be addressed to the rele -
vant NCA, which must inform the ECB and sub -
mit a draft decision to oppose or not to  oppose 
the acquisition to the ECB. Here too, however, 
the ECB will not be bound by the NCA’s draft 
decision but will have the final say on whether 
or not to oppose the acquisition (Article 87 of 
the SSM Framework Regulation).
In summary, it can be said that the common 
procedures clearly illustrate the ECB’s overall  responsibility for the entire banking sector of 
the participating member states – and not just 
for significant banks. Especially the withdrawal 
of authorisation, as a last resort in the pruden -
tial toolkit, will be the preserve of the ECB, in -
cluding for less significant banks.
Procedures for engaging in 
cross- border activities
While the authorisation of credit institutions in 
an SSM member state is always subject to an 
ECB decision, different rules apply to the estab -
lishment of legally dependent branches, which 
essentially require what is known as a “Euro -
pean passport”. This allows credit institutions 
which are authorised in one European Eco -
nomic Area (EEA) country to establish branches 
in any other EEA country without needing to 
obtain separate authorisation to do so. Notifi -
cation is mandatory, however. Credit institu -
tions are required to announce their intention 
to establish a branch in order to enable the 
supervisory authorities of the member states in 
question to monitor compliance with the rules 
of what is known as the “passporting regime”. 
A notable objective here is to allow the compe -
tent authorities in the host member state to 
 assess whether, taking into account the activ -
ities envisaged, there are any reasons to doubt 
the adequacy of the administrative structures 
or the financial situation of the credit institu -
tion in question (see Article 35 (3) of CRD IV). 
Procedures which were developed by the Euro -
pean Banking Authority (EBA) and which are 
likewise impacted by the establishment of the 
SSM are to be used for this purpose.11

Procedures regarding macroprudential powers
The recent fi  nancial crisis showed that – if 
the worst comes to the worst – safeguard-
ing the stability of individual fi  nancial insti-
tutions is not enough to guarantee the sta-
bility of the fi  nancial system as a whole. As 
fi  nancial agents are closely interconnected, 
the failure of one signifi  cant fi  nancial insti-
tution can put the stability and functioning 
of the entire fi  nancial system at risk and may, ultimately, have a considerable ad-verse impact on the overall economy. It is 
the task of macroprudential supervision to 
oversee the fi  nancial system as a whole, 
making it a necessary extension of the trad-
itional microprudential supervision of indi-vidual fi  nancial institutions. At the same 
time, macroprudential supervision relies on 
microprudential fi  ndings. For example, the 
information that is made available in the  institutions’ prudential reporting data is 
 essential for macroprudential policy in order to estimate the extent of systemic risk build- up in individual credit institutions or groups of credit institutions.
In order to achieve this objective, Article 5 
of the SSM Regulation stipulates that re-sponsibility for macroprudential tasks and 
tools will remain, fi  rst and foremost, under the control of the supervisory authorities, ie 
at the national level to all intents and pur-
poses, even after the launch of the SSM. However, the ECB will have the power to sharpen the macroprudential tools de-
ployed on the basis of European legal acts. 
This legislation also encompasses the op-
tion of requiring the application of certain 
macroprudential tools to the fi  nancial insti-tutions in the countries participating in the SSM, even if the tools in question have not yet been activated in the member state. At 
present, the ECB does not have the power 
to ease the tools imposed at the national 
level.This asymmetrical intervention model is 
 designed to prevent the national authorities 
from forbearing to implement necessary 
stringent measures out of consideration for their potential adverse impact on economic 
activity and employment in their countries, 
and therefore from failing to take early 
 action to counteract build- ups of risk with 
possible cross- border implications. How-
ever, it should be noted that the ECB only 
has the power to sharpen those tools that 
are based on the CRR and CRD IV. All ECB 
measures are, therefore, limited to the banking sector; it consequently has no power to infl  uence developments in the 
 insurance sector, for instance. One example 
of a macroprudential tool provided for 
under the CRR is the countercyclical capital 
buffer, by means of which surcharges on own funds requirements pursuant to the 
CRR can be imposed on credit institutions. 
It can be adjusted by the competent au-
thorities in the course of a fi  nancial cycle in 
such a manner that the additional capital 
requirements imposed on the credit institu-tions in the course of said cycle can fl  uctu-
ate in line with systemic risks. During cyc-lical build- ups of risk, this means that the 
fi  nancial institutions’ ability to absorb losses 
is strengthened, while lending is curbed to 
a certain extent. In the event of a cyclical downturn, the capital requirements of the 
countercyclical buffer can be lowered again in order to support lending to the real econ-omy.
The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)1 
also plays an important role in terms of 
macroprudential policy. The supreme 
decision- making body of this EU board, the 
1 The ESRB is responsible for all EU member states and 
the entire fi  nancial system. The SSM is responsible for

decision thereon lies solely with the ECB, pro -
vided the branch in question is a branch of a 
significant institution. Otherwise, responsibility 
falls to the supervisory authorities in the home 
member state. However, in both cases, notifi -
cation of intent must first be submitted to, and 
reviewed by, the supervisors in the home mem -
ber state.
The exercise of the freedom to provide services, 
ie the provision of (bank) services across na -
tional borders without establishing a branch 
abroad, is governed, in principle, by a uniform 
procedure throughout the EEA, regardless of 
whether a country is an SSM member or not. 
Any credit institution domiciled in an EEA coun -
try that wishes to carry out its activities in the 
territory of another EEA country for the first 
time is required to notify the supervisory au -
thorities in its home member state which activ -
ities from the “List of activities subject to mu -
tual recognition” (see Annex  I of CRD IV) it 
wishes to carry out. The interaction between this requirement and the SSM Framework 
Regulation gives rise to the following special 
situation. If the credit institution’s home coun -
try is a non-  SSM EEA member state and the 
host country is an SSM member state, the host 
country’s powers will always lie with the ECB. 
The outcome of this is that the activities of a 
non- SSM credit institution in the SSM area are 
always viewed from a European angle.
The SSM will also radically transform the com -
position of the colleges of supervisors which 
are presently responsible for the effective pru -
dential supervision of cross- border banking 
groups. These colleges were set up for banking 
groups with subsidiaries or significant branches 
in different EEA countries, making them the 
first port of call for the consistent application 
and enforcement of European supervisory rules 
and guidelines. Their main task is the coordin -
ated planning and execution of key prudential 
activities both during ongoing supervision and Exercise of the

sions Authority (EIOPA)), and the Chair of both the Advisory Technical Committee 
(ATC) and the Advisory Scientifi  c Committee

has members without voting rights, namely 
one high- level representative per member 
state of the competent national supervisory 
authorities and the President of the Eco-nomic and Financial Committee (EFC). 
While the ESRB has no powers of its own in connection with the use of macroprudential 
tools, it is able to issue warnings and rec-ommendations to the European Union as a whole, individual member states, the Euro-pean supervisory authorities (ESAs)
2 and the 
national supervisory authorities in order to 
address systemic risks.3 In future, this means 
that the ECB may also be a recipient of ESRB recommendations, which it will take 
into account in fulfi  lling its supervisory func-tions.

in crisis situations.12 The launch of the SSM will 
not do away with this arrangement as such, 
but some aspects will be refreshed. The partici -
pation of the ECB and national supervisory au -
thorities in colleges of supervisors is set out in 
Articles 8 to 10 of the SSM Framework Regula -
tion. Supervisory colleges in which all the mem -
bers are supervisory authorities of significant 
supervised entities from the SSM will be re -
placed by JSTs. Under the new regime, then, 
supervisory colleges will be convened only if (a) 
at least one national supervisory authority from 
a non-  SSM country is involved in the supervis -
ory college by way of a parent undertaking 
under its supervision, or a subsidiary or a sig -
nificant branch of the group in question, or (b) 
the supervised entity is a banking group which 
consists exclusively of less significant banks in 
the SSM area for which the relevant national 
supervisory authorities retain prudential re -
sponsibility in a college of supervisors.
The core task of supervisory colleges – where 
they continue to exist – will not be affected by 
the launch of the SSM. They will continue to be 
a key instrument for the supervision of cross-  
border credit institutions – a function which 
was re- emphasised and consolidated through 
the implementation of the CRD IV package, 
where legally non- binding basic principles for 
the operational work of supervisory colleges 
were replaced by binding EBA technical stand -
ards, which made them not only directly applic -
able law, but also fleshed them out in greater 
detail.
Staffing and funding
Recruitment of staff for the 
SSM
The assumption of supervisory responsibility 
under the SSM means that the ECB will need to 
expand its staffing resources significantly. The 
ECB plans to recruit roughly 770 staff for its 
SSM prudential activities, plus around 200 sup -
port staff (eg in the areas of IT, legal, HR, con -trol and audit). It already became clear at the 
preparatory stage that close and constructive 
cooperation between the ECB and the national 
supervisors would be vital for the SSM to 
achieve its aims. With this in mind, the Bundes -
bank is contributing more than just its oper -
ational expertise to the process of setting up 
the SSM. In April 2013, the Bundesbank began 
sending staff to the ECB to provide direct as -
sistance in getting the SSM up and running. 
The ECB began advertising the new posts early 
in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Staffing challenges
The supervision of significant SSM banks in the 
future JSTs and on- site inspection teams (OITs) 
will introduce an entirely new cooperative set- 
up and present a number of staffing chal -
lenges. For instance, in future staff from differ -
ent countries and supervisory authorities,13 
each  accustomed to operating in their own na -
tional supervisory cultures and under different 
employment conditions, will need to work 
across national borders. English is set to be -
come significantly more important than hith -
erto as a working language in day- to- day com -
munications.
Future cooperation within the SSM will chal -
lenge both the Bundesbank and the staff in -
volved to embrace an entirely new set of work -
ing methods. Staff across various locations will 
join forces to collectively exercise ongoing 
supervision over significant banks, collaborat -
ing in the JSTs much like a virtual team would 
do. The JST coordinator from the ECB will use a 
matrix structure to set the supervisory require -
ments, while the respective Bundesbank super -Supervisory 
 colleges will  remain a key 
 instrument under SSM

ior will be responsible for staff policy- related 
matters and general framework conditions for 
the Bundesbank team members.
It will take some time to formulate a definitive 
response to all the staffing challenges pre -
sented by the special and, in many respects, in -
novative collaborative and structural character -
istics of the SSM, first and foremost the areas in 
which national conditions of employment are a 
significant factor.
Supervisory fees
The cost of banking supervision by the ECB is 
to be borne by the supervised entities them -
selves. The ECB will, therefore, levy an annual 
fee on the credit institutions established in the 
participating member states pursuant to Article 
30 of the SSM Regulation. The ECB’s fees will 
cover the ECB’s expenditure in performing the 
tasks conferred upon it by the SSM Regulation.
More detailed provisions on determining the 
total amount of the supervisory fee, calculating 
the amount to be paid by each supervised bank 
or banking group, collecting the annual super -
visory fee and other procedural matters are 
 addressed in the ECB regulation on supervisory 
fees.14 The consultation documents on the ECB 
regulation on supervisory fees published in May 
2014 comment on the individual aspects of this 
regulation.
The ECB will use the supervisory fee to appor -
tion its direct costs for performing its oper -
ational activities in the four newly created Dir -
ectorates General, the Directorate General 
Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability, 
the Supervisory Board and the secretariat as 
well as pro rata  indirect costs for shared ser -
vices such as legal services, statistics, IT, HR and 
facilities. The SSM Regulation states that the 
supervisory fee must be cost- effective and rea -
sonable for all credit institutions. To ensure that 
this is the case, the ECB will communicate with 
the NCAs before setting the final fee level.When setting the supervisory fee, the ECB will 
break down its annual costs into the categories 
“Supervisory costs for significant entities” and 
“Supervisory costs for less significant entities”, 
with the costs in each category being appor -
tioned to the institutions.
The ECB’s supervisory fee in each category will 
consist of two elements – a fixed minimum fee 
component and a variable fee component. The 
minimum fee will generally be 10% of the costs 
in the category in question, divided by the 
number of institutions in that category. Owing 
to the special situation that the three largest 
credit institutions in each participating country 
are regarded as significant, irrespective of their 
actual size, the minimum fee component will 
be halved for the smaller significant institutions 
with total assets of €10 billion or less. The vari -
able fee component will be calculated as 50% 
of the following fee factors: the institution’s 
total assets (TA), and its total risk exposure 
(TRE) as an appropriate indicator of the risk 
profile.
The ECB will be unable to confirm the exact 
amount until 2015, but its preliminary calcula -
tion suggests that the ECB’s expenditure for its 
prudential activities will come to roughly €40 
million for November and December 2014, 
with a projection of around €260 million for 
2015. Of these total costs of €300 million for 
the SSM’s first accounting period, €255 million 
will be apportioned to significant banks and 
€45 million to the less significant ones. The ECB 
expects the supervisory fee to range between 
roughly €150,000 and €15 million annually for 
the directly supervised significant institutions, 
with the majority paying somewhere between 
€0.7 million and €2 million. As for the indirectly 
supervised less significant institutions, the an -
nual fee will range from around €2,000 to 
€200,000, with the bulk of them set to pay be -
tween €2,000 and €7,000.… and present

Fee notices will be issued by the ECB each cal -
endar year between 1  June and 31  August, 
with payment being due within a period of 
35 days. The first fee notice will be issued in 
2015. It will cover the fee period of November/
December 2014 as well as the advance pay -
ment for 2015.
Outlook
Europe’s Single Resolution 
Mechanism
With the SSM in place, the Single Resolution 
Mechanism (SRM) will be the second pillar of 
the banking union.15 Alongside the SRM, a 
European Single Resolution Board (SRB) and a 
Single Resolution Fund (SRF) will be established, 
putting in place a uniform institutional frame -
work for participating SSM member states that 
facilitates the resolution of credit institutions. It 
will thus bring liability and responsibility into 
alignment at the European level.
The small print surrounding contribution pay -
ments to the SRF is still a matter of negoti -
ations. The measurement of these contribu -
tions will be determined by way of a delegated 
act pursuant to Article 103 (7) of the Bank 
 Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and a 
Council implementing act pursuant to Article 
70 of the SRM Regulation. Judging by the draft 
versions of the delegated act, banks will each 
be required to pay a levy which essentially con -
sists of a flat contribution plus an additional 
risk- adjusted contribution.
Ideally, the calculation method would need to 
ensure that credit institutions share the cost of 
future banking crises in line with their contribu -
tion to systemic risk. It is particularly important 
in this regard that adequate account be taken 
of both the individual bank’s risk profile and the 
principle of proportionality, which dictates that 
small, low- risk institutions should contribute 
less to the SRF, relatively speaking, than their 
large, systemically important counterparts.Comprehensive assessment
The European SRF established under the SRM is 
not designed to cover SSM institutions’ legacy 
debts, that is to say, capital shortfalls that are 
already evident in banks’ balance sheets. Any 
such existing capital shortfalls arose while insti -
tutions were still being overseen by national 
supervisors, and therefore also need to be 
closed at the national level. That is why the 
comprehensive assessment (CA) of significant 
credit institutions, an exercise provided for in 
Article 33 (4) of the SSM Regulation, is a crucial 
step in the preparatory work for the SSM. The 
CA is reviewing the quality of bank assets as at 
31  December 2013. In addition to this asset 
quality review (AQR), the ECB, liaising with the 
EBA, is also performing stress tests which simu -
late potential scenarios in order to gauge their 
impact on the institutions’ stability. The scen -
arios consist of a baseline scenario simulating a 
typical macroeconomic path over a three- year 
horizon and an adverse scenario in which the 
economy is assumed to follow a particularly 
unfavourable and unlikely, yet conceivable, 
path.16
The ECB, liaising closely with the EBA and na -
tional authorities, is currently carrying out the 
CA. The results will be released on 26 October 
2014, just over a week before the ECB assumes 
responsibility for the direct supervision of sig -
nificant banks. If the CA finds that an institu -
tion has a capital shortfall, that institution will 
be given two weeks to submit a capital plan 
detailing how it intends to go about covering 
that shortfall – by raising capital in the markets, 
say. Institutions will be given either six months 
(for shortfalls arising under the AQR or the 
baseline scenario) or nine months (for shortfalls SRM to augment

arising under the adverse scenario) to imple -
ment their capital plans. Should the institution 
be unable to cover its capital needs by itself, 
the authorities of the relevant member state 
will have to step in. If necessary, this path might 
also lead to the resolution of the institution in 
question. Since responsibility for addressing 
legacy debts lies with national authorities, the 
member state in question can, in principle, ex -
ercise discretion in the tools it chooses to use 
for this purpose. However, the European legis -
lation governing public assistance must be ad -
hered to in this respect. This legislation requires 
losses to first be absorbed by shareholders and 
subordinated creditors before a recapitalisation 
using public funds is allowed.17 Although the 
BRRD resolution toolkit will probably not be 
transposed into German law before 1 January 
2015, this condition can already be met in Ger -
many by virtue of the transfer order instrument 
(section 48a et seq  of the Banking Act) which 
can, if necessary, be deployed in combination 
with the establishment of a bridge bank. In 
Germany, the restructuring fund financed 
through bank levies and the tax- financed 
 Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (SoFFin) are 
available as backstops for external funding. 
However, consistency with the principle that 
 investors should be the first in line to shoulder 
the risks and losses involved in their investment 
can be assured only if SoFFin is tapped as a last 
resort. If the CA identifies any need for action 
at German credit institutions, Germany is well 
prepared to face the challenges this will entail.
Conclusion
The banking union, of which the SSM is a sup -
porting pillar, is an important and necessary 
complement to European monetary union. 
Above all the banking groups which operate 
multinationally in Europe’s highly integrated 
 financial markets need to be overseen by a 
similarly interconnected, pan- European super -
visory mechanism based at a central supervis -
ory authority.The SSM will replace the existing, purely na -
tional banking supervisory set- up in the euro-  
area countries and, in toto,  will open up an 
 entirely new chapter in supervisory practice. A 
relatively short preparatory phase has seen the 
legal, institutional and organisational ground -
work being put in place to ensure that the 
changeover on 4  November 2014 will be as 
seamless as possible.
High hopes surround the launch of the SSM. By 
shifting the perspective away from a national 
approach towards an overarching European 
view with a uniform administrative practice, 
the SSM regime has the potential to improve 
the competitive environment in Europe’s bank -
ing market.
It is crucial for NCAs to be involved every step 
of the way. The SSM should be regarded as the 
supervisory mechanism of the ECB and the 
NCAs, which interact and assume tasks and 
functions in a cooperative manner. Not only 
does this mean that NCAs’ particular insights 
into national markets and banks can be tapped; 
it also prevents moral hazard resulting from dif -
ferent supervisory practices, combined with the 
risk of domestic banks being afforded preferen -
tial treatment.
The banking union will be able to get off to a 
successful start only if the currently existing 
burdens and risks of the significant banks which 
are to be supervised directly by the ECB in 
 future have been identified and catalogued be -
forehand. Even though the CA represents a 
huge administrative effort for both the banks 
involved and banking supervisors, the process 
of thoroughly evaluating credit institutions, and 
then remedying any problems it brings to light, 
is a crucially important step towards underscor -
ing the credibility of the SSM.
