Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic output in Germany could have con -
tracted again slightly in the third quarter of 
2019. This is mainly attributable to the con -
tinued downturn in export- oriented industry. 
By contrast, sectors with a stronger domestic 
focus probably continued to provide impetus. 
Enterprises in the consumption- related services 
sectors, for example, rated their business situ -
ation as decidedly positive. Retail sales and 
positive consumer sentiment also suggest that 
households’ strong appetite for consumption 
remained undimmed throughout the period 
under review. This is a reflection of the ongoing 
favourable situation in the labour market. The 
slowdown in economic activity has only had a 
limited impact on employment and unemploy -
ment so far. Consumers’ income prospects are 
still upbeat and the positive situation in the 
construction industry continues unabated. This 
means that Germany’s economic dichotomy 
continues. The business climate has deterior -
ated perceptibly in many services sectors with a 
smaller focus on consumers. At the same time, 
leading indicators currently show few signs of a 
sustained revival in exports and a stabilisation 
in industry. There is therefore a growing danger 
that the downturn there will increasingly spill 
over to more domestically oriented sectors. 
However, there are no signs so far of a reces -
sion in the sense of a significant, broad- based 
and persistent decline in economic output with 
underutilisation of aggregate capacity.
Industry
German industrial production interrupted its 
downward trend in August 2019. Seasonally 
adjusted industrial production increased signifi -
cantly on the month (+¾%), but on an average 
of July and August it was distinctly lower than in the second quarter (-¾%). This was primarily 
due to developments in the intermediate goods 
industry, where there was a steep and broad- 
based slump (-1¾%). Manufacturers of elec -
trical equipment were forced to cut production 
particularly severely, and there was also a con -
siderable decline in the manufacture of con -
sumer goods (-1%). By contrast, the output of 
capital goods stagnated, with other manufac -
turing, in particular, providing impetus, mainly 
driven by the production of medical devices 
and materials. The automotive sector had a 
considerable dampening effect, however. The 
renewed tightening of standards for new regis -
trations from September 2019 may have played 
a role here. The EVAP amendment, as it is 
known, is designed to significantly reduce the 
evaporative emissions that escape from motor 
vehicles. However, production stoppages in the 
automotive sector are unlikely to be as dramatic 
as those experienced in the summer of last year 
when a new emission test procedure entered 
into force. According to the Association of the 
Automotive Industry (VDA), the seasonally ad -
justed number of vehicles manufactured in the 
third quarter overall was just 1½% down on 
the quarter, which is only a slightly stronger de -
cline than in the preceding quarters.
Industrial new orders in Germany deteriorated 
again in August 2019, falling markedly on the 
previous month in seasonally adjusted terms 
(-½%) Taking July and August together, there 
was an even stronger decrease compared with 
the average of the second quarter (-1¼%). 
Above all, there was a lack of large orders, 
which are generally received at fairly irregular 
intervals. Without this effect, German industrial 
enterprises experienced a distinctly smaller con -
traction in new orders (-¾%). Looking at the 
geographic origin of new orders, there was less 
demand for German industrial products in par -
ticular from countries outside the euro area. 
The lack of large orders played a particularly 
significant role here. Furthermore, the inflow of Economic out -

domestic orders declined markedly (-½%). By 
contrast, demand from the euro area had a sta -
bilising effect with a clear increase of 1%. A 
sectoral breakdown shows that there was a 
broad- based deterioration in industrial orders. 
The order books of consumer goods manufac -
turers were worst affected (-3¼%), while pro -
ducers of capital goods (-1¼%) and the inter -
mediate goods sector (-¾%) reported a slightly 
smaller drop in orders.
In August 2019, nominal turnover in industry 
followed industrial output and expanded 
steeply, exceeding the previous month’s level 
by 1½%. On an average of July and August, 
however, turnover was distinctly below the 
average of the second quarter (-¾%). In re -
gional terms, sales were down somewhat more 
strongly in Germany and the euro area than in 
non- euro area countries, where sales of elec -
trical equipment, in particular, provided a 
boost. In a sectoral breakdown, industrial sales 
experienced a broad-  based decline in value 
terms. Manufacturers of intermediate, capital 
and consumer goods reported a similarly large 
decline in sales figures. In August 2019, nom -
inal goods exports fell steeply on the previous 
month (-1¾%) after seasonal adjustment. Tak -
ing July and August together, however, they in -
creased slightly (+¼%), and in price- adjusted 
terms they moved sideways. As with industrial 
turnover, the trade in goods with non- euro 
area countries had a supporting effect. By con -
trast, euro area exports were down signifi -
cantly. In seasonally adjusted terms, nominal 
imports of goods expanded distinctly in August 
on the month (+½%), but on an average of July 
and August fell steeply (-1½%). After eliminat -
ing price effects, there was only a slight decline 
(-¼%). This discrepancy is attributable to en -
ergy prices, which came down quite consider -
ably in the period under review.

sonal adjustment (-1½%). Taking the first two 
months of the third quarter together, there was 
also a slight contraction compared with the 
second quarter (-¼%). This was primarily due 
to a significant reduction in activity in the main 
construction sector (-1%), with construction ac -
tivity in general building and civil engineering 
contracting on a similar scale. By contrast, con -
struction activity in the finishing trades ex -
panded distinctly (+½%). Orders received in the 
main construction sector in July 2019 (the latest 
month for which data are available) rose mark -
edly on the previous quarter (+½%). New 
orders thus interrupted their downward trend 
and remained at a very high level after peaking 
at the turn of 2018-19 on the back of large 
orders. Ifo Institute surveys also indicate that 
construction activity is still basically good, with 
sentiment in the main construction sector, 
equipment utilisation and the reach of the 
order books in this sector remaining close to 
historic peak levels.
Labour market
The labour market is still robust. In spite of 
weak demand, employment grew throughout 
the reporting period, albeit only marginally. In 
August, there were 10,000 more persons in 
work in seasonally adjusted terms than in the 
previous month. As employment growth had 
been significantly stronger a year ago, the year- 
on- year increase was down to 333,000 per -
sons, or 0.7%. As in the case of the previous 
substantial rise, the current slowdown was also 
mainly attributable to employment subject to 
social security contributions. However, these 
jobs still showed significantly stronger growth 
than overall employment in year- on- year terms. 
This was due mainly to the number of persons 
exclusively in low- paid part- time employment 
and self- employed persons, which has been in 
decline for some time now. The leading indica -
tors for labour demand showed no further de -
terioration overall, meaning that the slow rise 
in employment could continue in the coming 
months.The number of registered unemployed persons 
fell again slightly in September for the first time 
in four months. After seasonal adjustment, 
2.28 million people were officially registered as 
unemployed with the Federal Employment 
Agency, around 10,000 fewer than in August. 
The unemployment rate remained unchanged 
at 5.0%. The number of unemployed persons 
fell by 22,000 compared to the same month of 
the previous year. The decline in September 
was not due to a cyclical improvement in the 
economy, however. In the cyclically sensitive 
category of SGB III job seekers (those receiving 
unemployment benefits under the statutory 
unemployment insurance scheme), the number 
of unemployed persons continued to rise in 
September, as in the preceding six months. By 
contrast, unemployment among those receiv -
ing the basic welfare allowance, which has a 
more structural basis, was down significantly. 
The unemployment barometer of the Institute 
for Employment Research (IAB) improved in 
September, but is still in negative territory. Un -
employment is therefore likely to edge up 
slightly in the next few months.
Prices
Against the backdrop of the attack on Saudi 
Arabian production facilities, crude oil prices 
surged in mid-  September 2019 but subse -
quently declined again. They were up by just 
over 5% on a monthly average compared with 
August, but were still around one- fifth lower 
than a year earlier. In October, prices declined 
again slightly and as this report went to press 
stood at US$60. Crude oil futures were traded 
at distinct discounts – US$2 for deliveries six 
months ahead and US$3 for deliveries 12 
months ahead.
In August 2019, both import and producer 
prices were down distinctly overall due to lower 
energy prices. By contrast, the prices of other 
goods were unchanged. The year- on- year fig -
ure for imports slipped slightly further into Steep decline in

negative territory (-2.7%), while that for manu -
factured goods remained positive (+0.3%).
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices as meas -
ured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) rose slightly in September 2019 
after declining in August. Food prices dropped 
marginally and prices for energy remained un -
changed in spite of higher crude oil prices, as 
refinery margins came down. However, indus -
trial goods excluding energy became slightly 
more expensive, and prices for services experi -
enced a somewhat more significant increase. 
Annual headline HICP inflation decreased 
slightly from 1.0% to 0.9% and, excluding en -
ergy and food, the HICP rose from 0.8% to 
1.0%. As was the case back in July and August, 
a special effect relating to package holidays 
had a dampening effect, but this was no longer 
as strong as in the previous months.1 At +1.2% 
compared with 1.4%, annual national Con -
sumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, which is not 
subject to this effect, was still somewhat higher 
than the HICP rate, which is more relevant for 
monetary policy. While this special effect relat -
ing to package holidays continues to depress 
the headline and core rates of the HICP some -
what in the current month, it will increase them 
significantly in November.
Public finances2
Local government finances
In the second quarter of 2019, the surplus in 
the local government core budgets and off-  
budget entities stood at €4½ billion, which 
amounted to a decline of almost €1½ billion 
on the year. After a somewhat stronger start to 
the year, revenue increased by only 3½% (€2 
billion). Among other factors, the rise in tax 
revenue was less dynamic, at 2½% (€½ billion). 
In particular, growth in local governments’ 
share in income tax was weak, although this is 
likely to have been a temporary phenomenon. 
However, revenue from local business tax con -
tinued its robust increase. The expansion in general and investment transfers from state 
governments was less strong than at the start 
of the year, but still came to 4%. By contrast, 
growth in receipts from fees became more dy -
namic (+7%).
Expenditure climbed sharply, by a total of 6% 
(€3½ billion). Growth in personnel expenditure 
stood at 8% (just under €1½ billion) and thus 
doubled in comparison with the start of the 
year. This reflects, above all, the pay increase 
negotiated in the spring 2018 collective wage 
agreement: this had not yet taken effect in the 
second quarter of last year, whereas in the 
same quarter of 2019, the second adjustment 
stage had already been implemented. More -
over, there is likely to have been a further in -
crease in staffing levels. The rise in other oper -
ating expenditure was slower but still signifi -
cant, at 4½% (€½ billion). By contrast, spend -
ing on social benefits remained stable overall. 
On the one hand, social assistance payments 
saw a significant increase (5%). On the other 
hand, there was a clear decline, notably, in ac -
commodation costs for the long- term un -
employed (-6%) and benefits for asylum seek -
ers (-12½%). Much like at the beginning of the 
year, an upsurge in fixed asset formation 
(+19½%, or just under €1½ billion) was a key 
factor in the strong expenditure growth.
At the end of the first half of 2019, local gov -
ernment was running a slight deficit of just 
under €½ billion, after posting a surplus of a 
similar size a year earlier. A considerable surplus 
is usually expected for the second half of the 
year. However, the balance for 2019 as a whole 
is likely to be below the large surplus recorded 
in 2018 (€10 billion).Consumer prices

2 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

At the end of the second quarter of 2019, local 
government debt was down by €1 billion on 
the end of the first quarter, thus totalling just 
over €135 billion (including liabilities to the 
public sector). Credit market debt fell to just 
under €95 billion. The volume of cash advances 
declined only moderately, reaching €37 billion. 
Cash advances are actually only intended to 
bridge temporary liquidity shortfalls. The fact 
that their total volume remains high indicates 
that action is needed.3
Securities markets
Bond market
At €120.5 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in August 2019 was somewhat 
down on July (€122.7 billion). After deducting 
the lower redemptions and taking account of 
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own debt 
securities, net issuance of domestic debt secur -
ities came to €27.2 billion. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign debt securities in Germany fell 
slightly by €0.2 billion in the reporting month, 
which meant that the outstanding volume of 
debt instruments in the German market rose by 
€27.0 billion overall.
During the reporting month, the public sector 
issued debt securities worth €24.1 billion net 
(following net redemptions of €7.6 billion in 
July). Central government was the main issuer 
of new securities (€17.1 billion), chiefly in the 
form of two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze) for €8.6 billion and ten- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) in the amount of €7.7 billion. It 
also issued five-  year and 30-  year Bunds total -
ling €3.3 billion and €1.0 billion respectively. At 
the same time, there were redemptions of 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) amounting to 
€3.7 billion. State and local governments is -
sued their own bonds worth €7.0 billion net.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €6.5 billion in August, following net redemptions of €1.1 billion in July. Non- financial 
corporations were the chief issuers on balance.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt by €3.3 billion net in August, 
following net issuance of €0.7 billion in July. 
The largest decline was in the outstanding vol -
ume of debt securities issued by specialised 
credit institutions (€2.9 billion), which include, 
for example, public promotional banks. How -
ever, there were also net redemptions of mort -
gage Pfandbriefe and public Pfandbriefe (€0.1 
billion and €0.9 billion respectively). Mean -
while, other bank debt securities that can be 
structured flexibly saw net issuance (€0.5 bil -
lion).
Domestic investors were the main buyers of 
bonds in August (€18.3 billion) with domestic 
non- banks acquiring bonds worth €10.8 billion

securities totalling a net €6.2 billion. Holdings 
of debt securities in the Bundesbank’s portfolio 
increased by €1.4 billion net. The vast majority 
of these were German debt securities issued by 
the public sector. Since January 2019, the Euro -
system has no longer been making any net pur -
chases under the expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (APP). However, principal payments 
are being smoothly reinvested over time, which 
means that, in individual months, there will be 
a net acquisition or net redemption on balance. 
Net purchases are set to resume in November, 
as decided at the September meeting of the 
Governing Council of the ECB. Foreign invest -
ors also increased their bond investment by 
€8.7 billion in net terms.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed very little in the way of new shares on 
the German equity market, issuing €0.1 billion in net terms. The volume of foreign equities in 
the German market fell by €0.7 billion during 
the same period. Domestic non- banks were the 
sole buyers of mutual fund shares on balance 
(€1.4 billion). Domestic credit institutions re -
duced their holdings by €0.6 billion. Foreign in -
vestors scaled back their equity exposure in 
Germany by €1.4 billion on balance.
Investment funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€9.9 billion in August, compared with €5.9 bil -
lion in July. On balance, specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the chief 
beneficiaries (€8.8 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, new shares were placed on the 
market primarily by mixed securities funds (€3.9 
billion) and bond funds (€3.7 billion). The out -
standing volume of foreign mutual fund units 
distributed in Germany rose by €3.5 billion in 
the reporting month. On balance, domestic 
non- banks were the sole purchasers of mutual 
fund shares in August (€13.8 billion). The bulk 
of these were domestic securities.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.9 billion in August 2019. The result was 
€4.3 billion down on the previous month’s 
level, which was attributable to a decrease in 
the goods account surplus that significantly 
outweighed the decline in the invisible current 
transactions deficit comprising services as well 
as primary and secondary income.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account contracted by €5.8 billion on 
the month to €17.0 billion. Exports of goods 
fell more strongly than imports of goods.
Germany recorded a deficit of €0.1 billion in in -

earlier. The smaller deficit was down to im -Hardly any net

provements in all three sub- accounts. The def -
icit in the services account narrowed by €0.6 
billion to €5.0 billion, with expenditure shrink -
ing more strongly than receipts. Expenditure on 
the use of intellectual property as well as in the 
area of IT services and management consulting 
services fell in particular. The primary income 
surplus increased by €0.6 billion in August to 
€9.1 billion. Here, again, this was due to a de -
cline in expenditure, mainly because, in the 
area of investment income, payments to non-  
residents from portfolio investment decreased. 
The secondary income deficit fell by €0.3 billion 
to €4.2 billion, with the decline concentrated in 
government expenditure.
In August 2019, developments in the financial 
markets were characterised by political uncer -
tainty and its effects on economic activity. 
Against this backdrop, Germany’s cross- border 
portfolio investment recorded net capital im -
ports in the amount of €4.7 billion, compared 
with net capital exports of €13.0 billion in July. 
This was driven by foreign investors purchasing 
German securities worth €7.2 billion. They ac -
quired money market paper (€5.3 billion) and 
bonds (€3.4 billion), but divested themselves of 
shares (€1.4 billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€0.1 billion). In August, domestic investors 
continued to boost their holdings of foreign se -
curities by €2.5 billion on balance. They also 
purchased mutual fund shares (€3.5 billion) 
and bonds (€0.7 billion). By contrast, they sold 
shares and money market paper (€0.8 billion in 
each case).
Direct investment recorded net capital imports 
of €3.8 billion in August compared with €5.7 
billion in July. The main reason for this was that 
foreign firms invested €7.4 billion net in Ger -
many. They chiefly granted intra- group loans 
(€5.6 billion), with foreign affiliates in particular 
awarding short- term financial credits to their 
parent companies in Germany (reverse flows). 
On top of this, foreign enterprises boosted 
their equity capital in Germany (€1.8 billion). 
German firms also injected additional capital 
into affiliated enterprises abroad (€3.6 billion). By contrast,

The sustainable finance market: a stocktake
Sustainability has become a key issue and an important investment criterion on the financial 
markets . Supervisory reporting data from within the European System of Central Banks bear 
testament  to the market growth in Europe, particularly in the area of green bonds. The data per -
mit an in- depth analysis of the holder structure of green bonds, which indicates that long- term 
investors, in particular, such as pension funds show a preference for green bonds over conven -
tional bonds.
There is a huge need for investment in sustainable projects, but given the lack of generally 
accepted definitions of “green” and “sustainable” and insufficient transparency about their use, it 
is unclear how the strong market growth observed in the recent past will continue to develop.
It is down to policymakers to set the course for the appropriate and efficient integration of 
sustainability  criteria on the financial market. Uniform, reliable metrics make it easier to factor 
long- term risks relating to climate change and sustainability into investment decisions. The Euro -
pean Commission, in particular, is currently working towards introducing a common classification 
system for sustainable activities, i.e. a taxonomy, which will facilitate the reliable and transparent 
classification of financial products and strengthen trust in sustainable assets.
Improving the general framework for sustainable investment will provide guidance and help what 
began as a niche development driven partly by marketing to evolve into a mainstream product. 
The key task now is to create transparency, which is a prerequisite for pricing that is commensur -
ate with inherent risk – and thus to strengthen the allocative efficiency of the capital market.Deutsche Bundesbank

The growing importance 
of sustainable investments
Over the past few years, financing instruments 
geared towards sustainability objectives have 
gained in importance on the financial markets, 
and the financial industry has expanded its ex -
pertise in this area. On the one hand, corporate 
finance and project finance aim at reducing 
current greenhouse gas emissions, while on 
the other hand serving as a way of investing in 
innovative, low- carbon technologies. The mar -
ket segment was given a particular boost by 
the Paris Agreement in 2015. One of the aims 
set by the international community was “mak -
ing finance flows consistent with a pathway to -
wards low greenhouse gas emissions and 
climate- resilient development”.1 In view of this, 
too, sustainability as an investment objective 
emerged as a key issue on the financial mar -
kets. At the same time, however, the question 
arose as to how financial market participants 
can channel investment into projects that are 
aligned with the aims of sustainable economic 
growth and mitigating (the impact of) climate 
change. Even though there is still no final an -
swer to this question, the volume of sustain -
able investment has nonetheless grown 
strongly since then.
The greater importance of sustainability on the 
financial market is also due to the fact that in -
vestors these days consider not just the return, 
conventional risks and liquidity when investing 
funds, but increasingly also factor in the risks 
associated with a lack of consideration for sus -
tainability factors. With risk optimisation chan -
ging in line with this, the result is that a grow -
ing group of investors find that investments 
with a – purely financially motivated – focus on 
generating value increasingly align with invest -
ments with a values- based incorporation of 
sustainability objectives.
The aforementioned risks go hand in hand with 
opportunities for investors, however. From a 
medium to longer- term perspective, market 
participants consider the investment opportun -ities to be substantial. This is consistent with 
calculations of the investment volume required 
to achieve global development and climate ob -
jectives. In order to bring global economic 
growth into line with the Sustainable Develop -
ment Goals2 and the Paris Agreement, the 
OECD, the World Bank and the United Nations 
Environment Programme estimate that infra -
structure investment alone would have to 
come to US$6.9 trillion a year up to 2030.3 At 
present, it is not known what share of this will 
be taken on by private players on the financial 
market, having weighed up the opportunities 
and risks. Long- term planning certainty is likely 
to be one of the main prerequisites for a per -
sistently high level of private capital provision.
Besides infrastructure investment, further 
growth in the market for sustainable finance is 
likely to be contingent on the extent to which 
enterprises perceive economic opportunities in 
revamping established product ranges in a sus -
tainable way, making more sparing use of nat -
ural resources and reducing environmentally 
harmful emissions. German industry estimates 
that this kind of reorientation, which is likely to 
encompass not just new products but also new 
or radically altered production processes and 
supply chains, will require extensive invest -
ment.4
Financial market participants have responded 
to the huge need for investment in sustainable 
projects and are placing more and more em -
phasis on sustainability factors in their invest -
ment decisions. On the one hand, this is illus -
trated by increasing volumes of green bonds Sustainability an

and sustainable investments, and on the other, 
by the growing number of investors signing up 
to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment 
(UN PRI; see the adjacent box) and thereby 
committing to considering sustainability factors 
(see the chart on p. 16).
The concepts of sustainability and sustainable 
investment have not been clearly defined, how -
ever, and are therefore open to interpretation 
by investors and issuers alike. Although the EU 
is endeavouring to specify uniform require -
ments with its taxonomy – a classification sys -
tem for sustainable economic activities – there 
is, at present, no framework at the global, 
European or national level which would allow 
sustainable investment of capital to be uni -
formly and clearly categorised and hence quan -
tified. But reliable metrics are vital to enabling 
financial market participants to adequately 
evaluate the opportunities and risks of different 
investments and to efficiently fulfil the capital 
allocation function of the financial market. In 
particular, when matched with reporting re -
quirements, common indicators are also a suit -
able means of reducing the risk of investors 
being misled about how sustainable their in -
vestments are.5
Responsible, sustainable and 
green investment: 
 attempting to define terms
Because there is no definition of sustainability 
on the financial market, it can be tricky for po -
tential investors to choose where to invest their 
funds, especially since often a variety of terms 
are used that seem synonymous at first glance. 
The broadest concept is that of socially respon -
sible investment (SRI). It typically encompasses 
the assets of all investors who have publicly 
committed to considering sustainability factors, But lack of def -
inition poses 
challenges
No definition, 
but some 
 concepts estab -
lished, including 
responsible 
investment …The Principles for 
 Responsible Investment
Initiated by the then United Nations 
Secretary- General Kofi   Annan in 2005 
and supported by the UN, the UN Prin-
ciples for Responsible Investment (UN 
PRI) defi  ne six principles which UN PRI 
signatories commit to apply on a volun-
tary and non- binding basis. A key ob-
jective of the principles is to incorporate 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) issues into the investment process.
To this end, the signatories undertake, 
fi  rst, to incorporate ESG issues into in-
vestment analysis and decision- making 
processes; second, to be active owners 
in their ownership policies and prac-
tices; third, to seek appropriate disclos-
ure on ESG issues; fourth, to promote 
acceptance and implementation of the 
UN PRI; fi  fth, to work together towards 
these goals; and sixth, to report on own 
activities and progress towards imple-
menting the UN PRI.
To date, around 2,500 asset managers, 
asset owners and service providers rep-
resenting investment capital totalling 
over USD 86 trillion have committed to 
the principles (as at September 2019).
5 This phenomenon is referred to as greenwashing and de -
scribes the risk of investing in a security that is marketed as 
being sustainable but which, upon closer inspection, does 
not comply with standard sustainability criteria and the in -
vestor’s requirements in particular.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

for example by signing up to the UN PRI or by 
adopting their own general investment guide -
lines.6 There is no scrutiny of the degree to 
which they actually follow through on this 
commitment at the level of the individual in -
vestments or portfolios. Instead, the sole focus 
is on the commitment made at the institutional 
level, which means that the design of specific 
sustainability criteria is of lesser importance.
Where environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) criteria are factored into the individual in -
vestment decision, meaning that specific re -
quirements are formulated at the security or 
portfolio level, this is referred to as sustainable 
finance or investment. Sustainable finance is 
not confined to climate and environmental pro -
tection issues, but also encompasses social as -
pects and questions about the composition 
and quality of management at firms in which 
investments have been or will be made. The 
subcategory of green finance, on the other hand, incorporates environmental aspects only 
(see the chart on p. 17).
Thus, unlike responsible investment, sustain -
able investment is based on specific require -
ments and hence, where possible, on a har -
monised understanding of suitable criteria. Yet 
choosing which benchmark to use is just as 
complicated as formulating appropriate min -
imum requirements for a security or its issuer 
with regards to their contribution towards 
achieving sustainability goals. This problem 
mainly affects the debt market, because when 
checking if bonds are sustainable or green fi -
nancial products, it always comes down to the 
use of the proceeds, which means that the sus -
tainability of the financed project has to be 
measurable. The capital raised by issuing sus -
tainable or green bonds therefore always has 
to be allocated to relevant projects. On the 
stock market, however, investors generally con -
sider the enterprise as a whole rather than indi -
vidual projects. The primary input into their in -
vestment decisions is a comparison of the rela -
tive sustainability of the enterprises based on 
predefined metrics. Enterprises considered by 
shareholders to be (relatively) sustainable may 
not necessarily be able to issue green bonds – 
to do so, they would have to implement appro -
priate projects and finance them via bonds. 
Conversely, creditors may not necessarily class 
the issuer of a green bond as sustainable.

among equity investors, in particular.7 Negative 
screening (the use of exclusion criteria), which 
can relate to individual firms as well as to entire 
sectors or countries, is not just the oldest8 but 
also the most widely used sustainable invest -
ment strategy today.9 One reason for this is 
that exclusions can be applied with relative 
ease and can be tailored according to individ -
ual needs. Even so, the exclusion of a specific 
firm from the investment universe is often 
grounded in extensive analyses.10 A less oner -
ous form of negative screening is norm- based 
screening, whereby all enterprises that do not 
uphold and support certain international norms 
and standards are excluded from the invest -
ment universe. For instance, failure to recog -
nise the International Labour Organization’s 
core labour standards, which prohibit forced 
labour and child labour, amongst other things, 
could be grounds for exclusion.
By contrast, positive screening explicitly in -
cludes companies in the investment universe. A 
widely used strategy in this approach is the 
best- in- class strategy, where the first step is to 
evaluate all companies in the theoretical invest -
ment universe –  the benchmark, such as a 
global stock index – using predefined ESG cri -
teria. A ranking is produced on the basis of 
these criteria, and the best companies in their 
respective sectors are added to the portfolio, 
contingent on a positive financial analysis. The 
aim is to promote sustainability in all sectors 
and to create incentives for ESG competition, 
as it were. A variation of this approach can re -
inforce the incentive mechanism and reward 
positive developments: rather than adding the 
best companies at the time of analysis to the 
investment universe, the investor adds those 
that have made the greatest progress over time 
in the inclusion of sustainability aspects. This is 
also referred to as a best progress strategy.
With thematic investing, on the other hand, in -
vestors – especially in the private equity seg -
ment – specifically seek out sectors or issues so 
as to support companies in certain sectors, 
such as solar technology or sustainable agricul -ture, and to profit from positive anticipated 
market developments in the chosen area. The 
focus can also be broader, however, and in -
clude renewable energy in general, or support 
reaching a specific development goal such as 
access to water.
Another approach related to thematic investing 
is impact investing. Here, however, the inten -
tion is to generate social or ecological value 
added alongside the usual return, giving rise to 
a double dividend – i.e. financial and moral.

7 The investment strategies described in this section have 
so far been applied mainly to equities, as the market for 
sustainable bonds focuses more on the financed projects 
than on the issuer. Nevertheless, the strategies cited here 
are also becoming increasingly important on the bond mar -
ket.
8 Traditionally, values- based exclusion criteria are used 
mainly by religious investors. In the second half of the 20th 
century, factors such as environmental catastrophes caused 
by companies, the Vietnam War and the Apartheid regime 
in South Africa led a broad group of investors to increas -
ingly withdraw capital from certain firms, some countries 
or entire sectors (“sin stock” sectors including weapons 
manufacturing and often tobacco, alcohol, gambling and 
pornography) (see Schäfer (2014)).

10 These track supply chains and calculate revenue shares; 
for a manufacturer of screws, for instance, the analysis 
would examine the share of screws delivered to arms 
manufacturers and whether to exclude not just the arms 
manufacturers but potentially also the screw manufacturer 
itself from the investment universe.Deutsche Bundesbank

jobs for minorities, or in microfinance projects 
in developing countries. Often, this entails con -
centration on a relatively small number of pro -
jects and investments and consequently low 
diversification.
Probably the most comprehensive sustainability 
strategy is what is known as ESG integration. In 
contrast to the approaches discussed so far, it 
is not simply an additional component along -
side conventional financial analysis but forms 
an integral part of it. ESG criteria and associ -
ated opportunities and risks are explicitly and 
systematically integrated into the analysis of a 
security’s risk/ return profile. This means, for ex -
ample, that drops in revenue stemming from 
reputational risk (following cases of corruption, 
environmental damage, etc.) or production 
sites threatened by extreme weather events 
can be incorporated into the investment analy -
sis, allowing for a better assessment of the 
medium- term financial stability of the analysed 
company.11In addition, institutional investors, in particular, 
frequently engage with companies through ac -
tive ownership, both informally and by exercising 
their formal rights as shareholders. This approach 
is referred to as engagement. Shareholders seek 
dialogue with decision- makers at the company in 
which they have invested, and thereby attempt 
to embed integration of ESG aspects within the 
company. They also influence policy using their 
votes and proposals at annual general meetings. 
If an investor owns a large enough share in a 
company, they can also participate in the com -
pany’s decisions directly and give sustainability 
aspects greater prominence on the agenda by 
taking a seat on the supervisory board.
The sustainable investment strategies given as 
examples here are not mutually exclusive. Many 
investors combine several of these approaches 
in order to give their influence on corporate 
sustainability the greatest possible impact. 
Negative screening is often paired with a best- 
in- class strategy, for instance. The engagement 
approach is also well suited to complement a 
best- in- class strategy, creating even stronger in -
centives to integrate ESG criteria.
Performance of sustainable 
equity investments
Sustainable investment strategies restrict in -
vestment opportunities. This typically worsens 
the risk/ return profile of an investment, be -
cause the a priori selection of permissible in -
vestments results in portfolios that bear con -
centration risk and are more exposed to unsys -
tematic risk.12 However, corporate profits can ESG integration:

Deutsche BundesbankSustainable investment strategies: 
an overview
11 Similar analyses are now also conducted by numerous 
credit rating agencies, which increasingly consider ESG as -
pects when determining a company’s creditworthiness.
12 According to Modern Portfolio Theory, pioneered by 
Markowitz (see Markowitz (1952)), a broadly diversified 
portfolio generates a better risk- adjusted return (see also 
Elton et al. (2017), who summarise the current status of the 
research). Values- based negative screening and other non- 
financial factors in decision- making would thus worsen the 
risk/ return profile. This logic suggests that ESG integration 
is the sustainability strategy with the smallest negative im -
pact on the risk- adjusted return, as it makes ESG criteria an 
integral part of conventional financial analysis.Deutsche Bundesbank

also depend on risks that were previously disre -
garded in financial analysis, such as climate 
risks. By helping to make previously neglected 
risks more visible, sustainability analyses and 
criteria can thus enable investors to make fi -
nancially successful decisions.13 The fact that 
investing in sustainable enterprises can be fi -
nancially attractive to investors, or at least does 
not have to put them at a disadvantage, is ex -
emplified by a comparison between the very 
broad stock index MSCI World and its sustain -
able sub- index MSCI World ESG Leaders over 
the past ten years as well as by a comparison 
of their European counterparts over the same 
period (see the adjacent chart).14
Against this backdrop, even investors with a 
primary focus on generating value are increas -
ingly considering ESG criteria. In Germany, for 
example, the volume of sustainable investment 
grew by over 70% between 2014 and 2018, in 
keeping with the global trend.15 But despite 
this strong market growth, it is clear that sus -
tainable investment still plays a fairly small role 
overall. The share of sustainable investment in 
the German market as a whole is estimated at 
less than 3%.16

bonds
Standards and definitions 
in the green bond market
The basic difference between a green bond 
and a conventional bond is the use of the pro -
ceeds for an earmarked purpose. However, the 
inability to clearly define and classify green pro -
jects means that green bond supply in the mar -
ket is still low at present. Over the past decade, 
the framework for issuers and investors regard -
ing transparency and provision of information 
has continued to improve. International dia -
logue between various stakeholders from polit -
ical and economic spheres paved the way for 
this, and continues to do so today. This has led 
to the development of a broad range of volun -Strong market

13 Empirical studies frequently find a significantly positive 
correlation between the financial success of firms and their 
integration of ESG criteria. For the most part, however, 
these analyses cannot establish causality, and neither the 
sustainability aspects incorporated into the various studies 
nor the underlying criterion for a company’s financial suc -
cess are necessarily comparable. Friede et al. (2015) evalu -
ate the results of over 2,000 analyses on this topic (with a 
very small portion of the analyses also considering invest -
ment of debt capital) and conclude that more than half of 
them show a significantly positive correlation compared 
with less than one- tenth that find a significantly negative 
correlation between financial success and ESG integration. 
Other overview studies arrive at similar findings (including 
van Beurden and Gössling (2008)). To date, however, there 
is no academic answer as to whether and to what extent 
sustainability aspects can provide a structural and causal 
explanation for investment returns.
14 While the MSCI World (Europe) includes over 1,600 
(400) medium- sized and large companies from 23 (15) 
countries throughout the world (Europe), the MSCI World 
(Europe) ESG Leaders comprises the approximately 800 
(200) best- performing companies according to MSCI’s in -
ternal ESG requirements. Alongside this best- in- class ap -
proach, negative screening is also used in the construction 
of the ESG Leaders indices.

tary guidelines, standards and frameworks. 
Moreover, some countries such as China, 
France and India have also initiated national 
regulatory measures to promote the establish -
ment of a domestic green bond segment.
In 2014, the International Capital Market Asso -
ciation (ICMA) published the Green Bond Prin -
ciples (GBP) with the aim of increasing the 
transparency, integrity and acceptance of green 
bonds. The principles are voluntary guidelines 
designed to support potential issuers in issuing 
a new green bond; they define four basic types 
of green bond (see the table above). To be rec -
ognised as a green bond as defined by the GBP , 
a bond must be issued in alignment with the 
four core components17 of the GBP . One of 
these four components relates to the use of 
the proceeds, for example. Various green pro -
ject categories are identified which relate to 
environmental protection (e.g. renewable en -
ergy, clean transportation, energy efficiency, 
etc.). The GBP also contain additional recom -
mendations, such as an external review of the 
four core components (e.g. by external consult -
ants, external auditors, certification companies, 
research and rating agencies) and the prepar -
ation of a communication strategy on the com -
patibility of the new issue with a company-  
wide sustainability strategy.18Similarly to the ICMA’s GBP , the Climate Bonds 
Initiative (CBI) developed the Climate Bonds 
Standard (CBS) and an associated certification 
scheme. The Standard consists of two comple -
mentary components. The overarching frame -
work specifies the management and reporting 
process. However, the centrepiece of the 
Standard is a classification system (taxonomy), 
which classifies individual sectors and eco -
nomic activities as environmentally sustainable 
on the basis of selected technical eligibility cri -
teria for green projects and assets.19 The Euro -
pean Commission is taking a similar approach 
with its plan to adopt an EU taxonomy guided 
by the GBP and CBS, which is intended to serve 
as the basis for an EU green bond standard (see 
p. 27).
Market developments  
in Europe and Germany
In 2007, the European Investment Bank (EIB) 
laid the foundation for the green bond seg -
ment when it issued its first Climate Awareness 
Bond. Since then, green bonds have become 
more attractive and accepted, particularly 
among investors interested in sustainability. But 
despite appreciable growth rates, outstanding 
green bonds only account for just under 2% of 
the international bond market as a whole.
The cumulative outstanding volume of green 
bonds in Europe has risen to €198 billion since 
2015 (see the chart on p. 21). The positive mar -
ket growth in Europe also shows that green 
bonds are an increasingly used source of fund -
ing. While the European market grew year by 
year over the observation period, the outstand -
ing volume in Germany experienced significant 
fluctuations at times. In 2017, the outstanding 
volume doubled for the first time, climbing 
from €4.4 billion to €8.8 billion on the year. Green Bond

After a dip in 2018, the outstanding volume of 
green bonds in the first half of 2019 had al -
ready come close to the level of 2018 as a 
whole.
Looking at issuance by sector, it can be seen 
that green bonds in Europe are being issued by 
non- financial corporations, financial corpor -
ations, government- backed entities and sover -
eigns (see the adjacent chart). At first, issuance 
was dominated by development banks and 
government-  backed entities, such as the EIB 
and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) 
in Germany. Development projects are evalu -
ated and selected based not just on their eco -
nomic benefit, but also taking into account en -
vironmental and social aspects. In subsequent 
years, industry and the financial sector also rec -
ognised the market potential and are increas -
ingly assuming a more active role by launching 
their own green bond issuance programmes. 
Finally, at the end of 2016, the first green gov -
ernment bond was issued by the Republic of 
Poland, with an issue volume of €750 million. 
Shortly afterwards, in January 2017, France is -
sued what was up until then the biggest green 
government bond, with an issue volume of €7 
billion.20 The preceding examples and the at -
tendant political signals they sent induced 
other EU countries – such as Ireland, Belgium 
and the Netherlands – to issue green govern -
ment bonds. Germany’s Finance Agency, rec -
ognising the Federal Government’s Sustainable 
Finance Strategy and a mandate granted by the 
State Secretaries’ Committee for Sustainable 
Development, is also looking into the issuance 
of a green or sustainable Federal bond.
KfW is still currently the largest issuer of green 
bonds in Germany. In the first half of 2019, it 
issued €3.8 billion worth of green bonds, 
achieving a market share of almost 60%. Over 
the last few years, both private financial institu -
tions and enterprises in the real economy have 
contributed to the development of the market 
in Germany. Mortgage banks, in particular, 
have established themselves as regular issuers. 
This is also evident from the ranking list of the largest issuers of green bonds in Germany (see 
the table on p.  22). Furthermore, the public 
sector is also contributing to an increasing 
green bond supply for investors. NRW Bank, a 
government-  backed entity, has already issued 
seven green bonds, for instance. Besides this, 
the federal state of North Rhine-  Westphalia has 
issued five sustainability bonds. The latter rep -
resent a further category of sustainable bonds 
that are simultaneously used to fund environ -
mental and social projects. These include, for 
example, funding educational projects and in -
vesting in sustainability research.
The fact that investors are generally becoming 
more interested in topics relating to sustainabil -
ity is also having a knock- on effect on innov -
ation within the financial sector. In addition to 
funding climate projects through green bonds, 
thematic investing is rising in importance. This 
includes, inter alia, sustainability bonds, social Development

bonds (e.g. to finance social housing projects) 
and SDG bonds (funding that contributes to 
one or more of the UN’s 17 sustainable devel -
opment goals (SDGs)). To reach a broader 
group of institutional and private investors, 
large financial institutions and investment com -
panies are increasingly launching investment funds and exchange- traded funds (ETFs) and 
investing in green and sustainable bonds.21
At present, it is still unclear what impact the 
issuance of a green bond has on its yield. On 
the one hand, issuers incur internal and exter -
nal inspection and documentation costs (e.g. 
certification, second party opinion, impact re -
porting), which can be passed on to investors. 
On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume 
that, if the credit risk is the same, investors will 
not be willing to forgo yields or pay a higher 
price to invest in green bonds compared to 
conventional bonds issued by the same issuer.
The following section examines green bonds 
and conventional bonds issued by KfW and the 
EIB to determine whether yield spreads exist in 
secondary market trading. When deciding 
which bonds to include in the analysis, denom -
ination in euro and residual maturity were key 
factors. The chart below shows the yields to 
maturity depending on the individual residual 
maturity of the bond. Four out of five of KfW’s 
green bonds trade at a slight yield discount on 
the secondary market compared to its conven -
tional bonds. Only one green bond with a rela -
tively short residual maturity trades at a yield 
mark- up and can be regarded as an outlier in 
this example. At least in the case of KfW, it ap -
pears that investors are currently willing to 
forgo yields and pay a higher price for green 
bonds. Another potential reason is that de -
mand for green bonds outstrips supply, causing 
them to exhibit higher prices in the capital mar -
kets as a result of scarcity conditions. The same 
approach is used to analyse bonds issued by 
the EIB. The yields of all six green bonds seem 
to be almost exactly on a par with those of the 
conventional bonds issued by the EIB. In con -
clusion, comparing conventional and green Unclear whether

bonds of the two issuers does not reveal a clear 
pattern in terms of yield spreads.22
The latest academic research likewise fails to 
provide any definitive evidence that sustainable 
bonds present an advantage in terms of fund -
ing costs. The following selection of research 
and studies reveals isolated yield discounts in 
the context of primary market issuance. Two 
things should be noted here: first, that the 
green bond market is still relatively small, and, 
second, that the historical data available can -
not yet provide reliable information spanning a 
longer observation period.23
In their studies, VanEck (2017) and Östlund 
(2015) conclude that, in the context of primary 
market issuance, there is no cost advantage 
over a conventional bond in the form of lower 
interest costs for the issuer.24 A study by the 
rating agency Standard & Poor’s on the same 
subject comes to a similar conclusion, although 
its focus is on secondary market trading.25
The research paper by Zerbib (2017), on the 
other hand, finds that there is indeed evidence 
of a “green bond premium”.26 Based on a sam -
ple of 135 investment- grade green bonds, the 
analysis shows an average funding cost advan -
tage of 8 basis points compared to conven -
tional bonds from the whole range of 
investment- grade bonds analysed. On average, 
euro- denominated green bonds and US dollar- 
denominated green bonds traded at a yield dis -
count of 2 basis points and 5 basis points, re -
spectively. The author concludes that the yield 
discount observed is the result of high demand 
for green bonds.27
A study by Ehlers and Packer (2017) comes to a 
similar conclusion. Their analysis was based on 
a selection of 21 green bonds issued between 
2014 and 2017, which they compared to con -
ventional bonds issued by the same issuer. The 
authors ultimately noted that issuers’ refinan -
cing costs in the capital market were 18 basis 
points lower on average when issuing green 
bonds as opposed to conventional bonds.28In their research paper, Kapraun and Scheins 
(2019) use both secondary market and primary 
market data to examine whether a yield dis -
count exists. Particularly in the primary market, 
they identified yield discounts of 20 to 30 basis 
points depending on currency and type of is -
suer. Furthermore, they observed higher yield 
discounts for bonds issued by governments 
and supranational institutions, as well as in 
connection with placements of secured bonds 
and for bonds denominated in US dollars. Yield 
discounts on corporate bonds were found to 
be smaller, probably owing to lower demand 
from institutional investors and the difficulty in -
volved in issuing this type of bond.29
The EU’s Sustainable Finance 
Action Plan
In the context of its measures to complete the 
capital markets union, the European Commis -
sion is committed to ensuring that the Euro -
pean financial system and its participants sup -
port long- term, low- carbon economic growth 
and invest in the appropriate technology. This 
will help it deliver the contributions it has 
pledged to make towards global environmental 
and climate goals.30 To this end, in March 2018, 
the European Commission presented an action 
plan on the financing of sustainable growth, 
which, if implemented as intended, will likely 
have a major bearing on the market for sus -
tainable financial investments.31 However, this 
action plan sees the Commission move away Yield discounts

22 The yield effect at the portfolio level remains unclear, as 
a BIS study shows (see Fender et al. (2019)). Analysis of the 
portfolios of green and conventional bonds shows them to 
be largely similar in terms of typical yield and risk figures.

Analysis of the holder structure of green bonds 
held in the EU
The data from the Eurosystem’s securities 
holding statistics (SHS)1 enable an analysis 
of the holder structure of green bonds held 
in the EU.2 There has been a marked in-
crease in the stocks held in the EU over the 
past six years. While the market value of 
green bonds at the end of the third quarter 
of 2013 totalled €0.7 billion, a value of 
€72.9 billion was recorded at the end of 
2018 (see the upper adjacent chart).The most signifi  cant holder group in the EU 
is investment funds, with stocks of €23.9 
billion (see the lower adjacent chart). Insur-
ance companies’ holdings are only margin-
ally smaller, amounting to €23.4 billion. 
Commercial banks follow in third place with 
stocks of €15.2 billion. Pension funds (€5.3 
billion) and general government (€2.9 bil-
lion) hold signifi  cantly lower values than the 
three groups mentioned above.
An analysis by country shows that investors 
in France (€21.6 billion) and Germany (€19.5 
billion) hold the largest stocks of green 
bonds.3 A major driver here is the size of 
the economies and the associated import-
ance of their fi  nancial sectors. With regard 
to France, the key role played by the insur-
ance sector is striking – it accounts for 67% 
of the green bonds held by French invest-
ors. The Netherlands claims third place with 
relatively high stocks of green bonds (€10.0 
billion). Banks, in particular, play a very im-
portant role in the Netherlands, holding 
86% of green bonds. Luxembourg follows 
in fourth place with a volume of €6.7 bil-
lion. Here, the investment fund sector is 
particularly important, accounting for 84% 
of the green bonds held in the country. This 
1 The SHS data are granular securities holdings data 
from the Eurosystem and other European countries. 
The statistics therefore cover securities held in the EU 
(excluding Croatia, Sweden and the United Kingdom). 
Data are collected by the national central banks of par-
ticipating countries. The stocks held are broken down 
into holding countries and holding sectors for each 
type of security. In this context, the securities holdings 
statistics provide the underlying data for the stocks 
held in Germany.
2 The selection of green bonds is in line with Bloomb-
erg’s classifi  cation based on the Green Bond Principles.
3 Account should be taken of the fact that investment 
funds and other investment vehicles can cause the SHS 
data to give a distorted picture of the ultimate holders 
and thus also their countries of residence.Green bonds held in the EU* by holder

refl  ects Luxembourg’s prominent role in the 
European investment fund sector.
The following section examines whether in-
dividual holder groups show a particular 
preference for green bonds. For this pur-
pose, the existing green bond dataset is ex-
panded to include conventional bonds. All 
normal bonds issued by issuers of green 
bonds are now added to the dataset, too.4 
A cross- section of all holder groups shows 
that the share of the total volume of green 
bonds is 53% (see the chart above). There-
fore, the issuers included in the dataset fi  -
nance a larger amount in the EU through 
green bonds than through conventional 
bonds. A look at the individual holder 
groups can give an indication of whether 
certain groups show a particular preference 
for green bonds. This is the case if the share 
of 53% across all holder groups is exceeded 
by an individual holder group. In particular, 
pension funds which choose to hold green 
bonds –  with a share of 74%  – show a 
strong preference for green bonds over 
normal bonds. The shares are also above 
average for general government and invest-
ment funds, equalling 67% and 66% re-
spectively. By contrast, the share of 39% 
recorded by commercial banks is below 
average.
A breakdown of investors by country shows 
that the share of direct investments in green 
bonds is 63% for institutions in Luxem-
bourg.5 Holders in the Netherlands (62%) 
and France (56%) follow – also both above 
the overall average of 53%. Holders in 
countries with absolute high investment 
volumes evidently also tend to hold a dis-
proportionately large number of green 
bonds compared with normal bonds. 
Among these countries, Germany falls just 
short of the average of all of the countries 
with a share of 51% in direct investments in 
green bonds.4 Therefore, the expanded dataset comprises only 
bonds from issuers who have issued at least one green 
bond and one conventional bond with virtually the 
same features. The sample covers the period from 
2013 to 2018. Stocks held in the EU countries of Cro-
atia, Sweden and the United Kingdom are not in-
cluded. Issuers who only issue conventional bonds are 
not taken into account. Thus, the fi  gures presented in 
the analysis do not refl  ect the ratio of all green bonds 
issued in the EU to all conventional bonds issued in the 
EU.
5 The data do not allow any reliable conclusions to be 
drawn with regard to the relative preference for green 
bonds in the various countries, but can only provide 
indications since it is not always possible to capture 
the countries of residence of bond holders precisely 
(see footnote 3).Holder structure of green bonds versus

from the overall concept of sustainability and 
focus on green finance and, in particular, cli -
mate change. The action plan builds on the 
work of a high- level expert group (HLEG), man -
dated by the European Commission, which 
presented strategic recommendations and nu -
merous sector- specific proposals in January 
2018.32 It consists of three overarching object -
ives and outlines ten actions needed to achieve 
them (see the chart above). The action plan will 
provide a uniform taxonomy, i.e. a classification 
system of sustainable economic activities, 
which, according to the Commission, will form 
the core of the action plan and create the basis 
for further actions. The Commission has al -
ready proposed draft legislation relating to the 
establishment of this taxonomy, sustainability 
benchmarks and disclosure of the methods 
used to integrate and evaluate ESG factors.33
The European Commission tasked a technical 
expert group (TEG) with the specific design of 
the three legislative proposals. The TEG also re -
ceived a mandate to develop an EU Green 
Bond Standard. As things stand, work on the 
EU standard and the three regulatory proposals 
should be completed by the end of 2019.
The European Commission intends the tax -
onomy to form the basis for the EU’s sustain -
ability strategy for the financial system. The aim is to define a set of criteria (see the chart on 
p. 27) for determining whether or not an eco -
nomic activity is to be regarded as sustain -
able.34 However, there are concerns that the 
binary nature of the taxonomy could prevent 
gradations in financing conditions, since the 
taxonomy itself does not reflect that economic 
activities can achieve various degrees of sus -
tainability. Another criticism is that the Euro -
pean Commission is focussing almost exclu -
sively on the ecological dimension of sustain -
ability.35 European primary law does not pro -
vide for such a hierarchy of the various 
dimensions of sustainability, but refers to them

mission argues that the proposed legal frame -
work could be broadened going forward to 
include aspects beyond climate change and in -
corporate additional sustainability goals. The 
taxonomy could be applied, in particular, to the 
planned introduction of sustainability labels for

The TEG’s proposal for the creation of an EU 
green bond standard is closely linked to exist -
ing, established market standards, particularly 
the requirements listed earlier for the Climate 
Bonds Initiative and the Green Bond Principles 
published by the ICMA. In its final report on the 
EU green bond standard, the TEG makes rec -
ommendations to both the European Commis -
sion and market participants and highlights 
four key requirements a bond should meet in 
order to be certified as a green bond according 
to the EU standard. First, the EU taxonomy 
should be used to assess the project to be fi -
nanced. Second, a green bond framework 
should be established, comprising information 
about the scope of the investment, the envir -
onmental goals associated with it, and report -
ing while the project is in progress. Third, the 
TEG proposes requirements for reporting on 
the use of proceeds and the environmental im -
pact of the project being funded. The fourth 
recommendation is the mandatory verification 
of the project by an external evaluation body. 
Issuers would be free to implement the EU 
standard on a voluntary basis, and its applica -
tion would not be limited to Europe. Instead, 
the hope is for it to have global reach and es -
tablish itself as a hallmark of quality for green 
bonds, thus reducing any doubts potential in -
vestors might have about the positive environ -
mental impact of such bonds.
To boost confidence in sustainable investment 
– not only in the form of bonds, but also in 
other asset classes – the European Commission 
intends, moreover, to introduce benchmarks to 
prevent “greenwashing”.37 These benchmarks 
will serve as guidance for investors aiming for a 
green portfolio but lacking the resources to 
perform in- depth sustainability analyses. To en -
sure the credibility and comparability of the 
sustainability benchmarks, the TEG is proposing 
transparency requirements for index providers, 
which will oblige them to disclose the criteria 
they apply to determine which securities or is -
suers are included in a benchmark. The Euro -
pean Commission’s decision in June 2019 to 
update the voluntary guidelines on non-  financial reporting to include the disclosure of 
climate- related aspects, in particular, can prob -
ably also be seen as part of its efforts to im -
prove transparency in the market.
Outlook for sustainability 
and climate protection 
on the financial market
Given that the most fundamental function of 
the financial market is to allocate capital to real 
economic activities, the Paris Climate Agree -
ment has highlighted the importance of finan -
cial flows in the fight against climate change 
and the implementation of sustainable devel -
opment goals. The financial market unites lend -
ers with borrowers and, in the interests of both 
sides, allocates resources to the best possible 
use – in economic jargon, this is known as 
“utility maximisation”. While some investors 
simply consider the “best” investment projects 
to be those that are most lucrative on a risk-  
adjusted basis, others also take into account 
additional aspects such as their underlying 
moral values. From an economic perspective, 
market efficiency and sustainability coincide

Sustainable fi  nance initiatives in Germany
The German Federal Government is cur-
rently developing its own sustainable fi  -
nance strategy, and, similarly to the EU, is 
working in close cooperation with the vari-
ous stakeholders involved. In February 
2019, the State Secretaries’ Committee for 
Sustainable Development, which is the Fed-
eral Government’s central body for the im-
plementation, review and refi  nement of 
Germany’s sustainability strategy, initiated 
the founding of a Sustainable Finance Ad-
visory Council. At present, this council is 
supporting the Federal Ministry of Finance, 
the Federal Ministry for the Environment, 
Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety 
and the Federal Ministry for Economic Af-
fairs and Energy in their efforts to develop a 
sustainable fi  nance strategy for Germany. 
The Advisory Council includes representa-
tives from the fi  nancial market, the real 
economy, academia and civil society to en-
sure that a balance is struck between the 
different interests and priorities of these 
groups. The Bundesbank and the Federal 
Financial  Supervisory Authority are also in-
volved in this dialogue, contributing their 
fi  nancial market expertise and insights 
gained from working closely with other 
central banks and supervisory authorities 
around the globe. Meanwhile, the Federal 
Government and the Advisory Council are 
able to build on years of extensive prelimin-
ary work carried out by the German Council 
for Sustainable Development, another ad-
visory body of the Federal Government, as 
well as private sector initiatives. Particularly 
notable in this area are the Hub for Sustain-
able Finance (H4SF)1 and the Green and 
Sustainable Finance Cluster Germany 
(GSFCG),2 which for years have sought to 
ensure that Germany as a fi  nancial centre 
contributes to sustainable development and 
the mitigation of climate change. For this to happen, the institutions involved in the 
existing initiatives – among them the Bun-
desbank – argue the need for a uniform set 
of practicable indicators and transparent re-
porting of a comparable standard in order 
to facilitate adequate assessment of the 
risks and opportunities associated with sus-
tainability. Such indicators would also be 
useful to support the Federal Government’s 
planned communication strategy for sus-
tainable fi  nance by making the topic more 
tangible and easily understandable for con-
sumers.
1 Founded in 2017 by Deutsche Börse and the German 
Council for Sustainable Development, the H4SF is an 
open network of fi  nancial market participants that has 
identifi  ed ten key fi  elds of action for developing a sus-
tainable fi  nancial sector in Germany. The network fos-
ters discourse on these recommendations by organis-
ing an annual Sustainable Finance Summit, the most 
recent of which was held in Frankfurt on 16 October 
2019.
2 The GSFCG was formed in 2018 by the merging of 
two initiatives run by Hesse’s Ministry of Finance and 
Deutsche Börse. In its role as an observer on the Stand-
ing Committee of the GSFCG, the Bundesbank contrib-
utes to the network’s aims of pooling the sustainability 
expertise of fi  nancial market participants in Germany 
and serving as a central point of contact for related 
matters.Deutsche Bundesbank

market – adequately capture external costs and 
income. Transparency on social external factors 
such as the impact of climate change is a key 
prerequisite for the efficient allocation of re -
sources and capital.
Ultimately, the financial market can only per -
form its allocation function if there is sufficient 
information about the risk/return profiles of the 
investment opportunities and if the skills and 
capacity to process the available information 
and data exist. In order to reflect investment 
risks in asset prices, market participants have to 
be able to identify and dissect them accurately. 
Medium and long- term risks, above all, have 
traditionally been disregarded as they were 
seen to be fraught with uncertainty. These also 
include climate risks, in particular. Today, al -
though the exact realisation of these risks re -
mains uncertain, there is now broad academic 
consensus that negative economic effects of 
climate change will materialise, particularly if 
adaptation and mitigation measures are not 
taken promptly.38 The debate in the financial 
sector, as elsewhere, is therefore not about 
whether to take these risks into account, but 
how.
More and more investors – especially institu -
tional investors, which often need to hedge 
long- term payment obligations – are therefore 
also making efforts to minimise long- term risks 
in their portfolios and, at the same time, take 
advantage of the opportunities the transition 
towards a low- carbon economy offers. This 
value-  based approach is often complemented 
by a values- based perspective and takes into 
account social and corporate governance fac -
tors as well.While it is in financial market participants’ own 
interests to analyse the scope and relevance of 
climate and sustainability risks and to adjust 
their portfolio or risk management where ne -
cessary, responsibility for sustainability and cli -
mate policy lies in the hands of elected polit -
icians. This also applies to the internalisation of 
external costs. The financial market can only 
help to achieve sustainability goals and allocate 
resources accordingly if efficient market price 
formation and solid key data are in place as a 
basis for valuations and decisions. With almost 
€100 trillion of assets under management, only 
a fraction of which are currently invested sus -
tainably, the financial market industry can play 
a key role in the reallocation of assets along 
these lines going forward.
Through its action plan for financing sustain -
able growth, the European Commission is hop -
ing to help facilitate this reallocation of assets 
into sustainable activities, notably by using the 
taxonomy to boost the confidence of potential 
investors in the impact of various forms of sus -
tainable investment. The German government 
has likewise made a clear commitment to pro -
moting sustainable finance. New transparency 
requirements, information campaigns and the 
uniform classification system are likely to make 
the opportunities and risks involved clearer, 
thus opening up sustainable investment to pri -
vate investors, too. If public interest in climate 
change is any indication of demand for finan -
cial investments that align with this issue, then 
the market for sustainable financial investment 
is likely to continue expanding in the future.… but it needs 
sufficient infor -
mation to do so

The European market for investment funds 
and the role of bond funds 
in the low   interest rate environment
As a result of substantial net inflows of capital and significant increases in value, assets under 
management in investment funds have grown strongly worldwide over the past few years. The 
general ascendancy of capital markets as a source of funding and investment opportunities 
observed since the financial crisis is thus in evidence in the fund industry as well. Furthermore, 
cross- border funds are gaining in importance in the European market for investment funds. This 
is a sign of increasing market integration.
European bond funds, which managed assets to the tune of €3.4 trillion at the end of the second 
quarter of 2019, have been influenced to a large extent in recent years by the increasingly 
entrenched low interest rate environment in which they have been operating. For one thing, the 
declining interest rates buoyed investor demand for fund investments, as these benefited from 
price gains and alternative, interest- bearing investments promised slimmer returns. For another, 
the search for yield increasingly left its mark on funds’ asset management practices, with funds 
giving higher weights to riskier, less liquid and long- dated debt securities. For funds invested in 
European debt securities, this translated into a higher share of corporate bonds at the expense of 
government bonds and bank debt securities. The mounting liquidity risks this has caused for 
funds’ asset holdings is a particular issue for retail funds with a large number of small- scale 
investors. Analyses conducted in this field show that periods of falling prices leave these funds 
especially vulnerable to outflows, which can be amplified by feedback loops with securities mar -
kets. Overall, this underlines the importance of actively managing portfolio liquidity as a way of 
preventing illiquidity- induced, self- reinforcing outflows of capital from funds.Deutsche Bundesbank

The global market  
for investment funds
Assets under management (AuM) in invest -
ment funds have grown strongly worldwide in 
recent years. Globally, this market continues to 
be dominated by US funds. At an equivalent of 
€48 trillion, US funds currently account for al -
most half of global AuM (see the table on 
p. 35). Funds domiciled in the euro area man -
age just under one- quarter of global AuM: at 
the end of the first quarter of 2019, they held 
assets amounting to €11.4 trillion, which is 
slightly more than double the end-2011 figure. 
Fund AuM also rose markedly relative to annual 
gross domestic product (GDP). At last count, 
they were roughly on a par with euro area GDP 
in 2018, whereas they corresponded to no 
more than around three- fifths of GDP in 2011.
Growth in fund AuM reflects both significant 
increases in value and substantial net inflows of 
capital. Since the start of 2012, investors world -
wide have acquired investment fund shares 
worth €10.7 trillion net, investing similar 
amounts in European and US funds (€3.8 tril -
lion and €3.7 trillion, respectively). US funds in 
particular, whose assets have increased by a 
total of €12.0 trillion since 2012, also recorded 
substantial increases in value. As a case in 
point, global equity prices –  as measured by 
the MSCI World index – went up by 78% be -
tween the end of 2011 and the end of March 
2019.1 In the United States, meanwhile, shares 
appreciated by as much as 125% (S&P 500).2 By 
comparison, the assets managed by European 
funds rose by a smaller €5.8 trillion. Their mark -
edly weaker increases in value were probably 
due primarily to the comparatively minor im -
portance of European equity funds.
With respect to investment focus, equity funds 
are the biggest investment funds globally, ac -
counting for 42% of total AuM. This reflects, in 
particular, the important role played by US 
equity funds, which manage more than half of 
US fund assets. Compared to the United States, 
investment funds domiciled in the euro area focus more on debt securities. In addition to 
general investor preferences, this is also likely 
– in Germany, for instance – to reflect the im -
portance of institutional investors, which invest 
to a greater extent in mixed funds and bond 
funds. Overall, the assets managed by Euro -
pean equity funds, mixed funds and bond 
funds are broadly on a par with each other.
The increased significance of investment funds 
is related to the growing relevance of capital 
markets as a source of funding and investment 
opportunities. First, this is explained by factors 
whose effects may be time- limited, such as the 
monetary policy accommodation and non-  
standard monetary policy measures imple -
mented by central banks in the aftermath of 
the financial and sovereign debt crisis. In the 
euro area, the Eurosystem’s asset purchase 
programmes probably played a part in reducing 
market- based debt financing costs. The corpor -
ate sector purchase programme (CSPP) is also 
likely to have buoyed non-  financial corpor -
ations’ issuance activity in the bond market.3 
Second, longer- term factors, such as efforts on 
the part of enterprises to make greater use of 
non- bank funding sources, the tighter banking 
regulations in the wake of the global financial 
crisis and the ongoing consolidation of banks’ 
balance sheets, are also bound to have made a 
major contribution to the increased signifi -
cance of capital market financing. In the euro 
area, this development was also accompanied 
by initiatives to advance the capital markets, in -
cluding, for instance, the still relatively small, 
newly established equity and bond markets tar -
geting medium- sized enterprises.4Strong growth

Directive (MiFID  II) saw the creation of a new category of 
trading venues to facilitate access to capital markets for 
SMEs.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

From the point of view of investors, investment 
funds also offer certain advantages that are 
likely to have supported market growth. Funds 
let them diversify their investments with com -
parative ease, have them professionally man -
aged and invest in markets that might other -
wise be difficult to access. Exchange- traded 
funds (ETFs), whose market volume has been 
growing at a very dynamic pace over the past 
few years, also offer investors the advantage of 
comparatively low fund fees.5
As a general rule, the increased significance of 
investment funds can help boost financial sys -
tem efficiency and resilience and thus bring 
with it key macroeconomic benefits. Invest -
ment funds can be an important additional 
source of funding for the real economy – espe -
cially in times of crisis. Their increased relevance 
is also likely to stimulate international invest -
ment and strengthen competition for capital in 
the financial system. However, these benefits 
are counterbalanced by risks to efficient capital 
allocation and, in extreme cases, even to finan -
cial stability. It is likely that these risks, which 
ultimately have their roots in specific incentives 
for fund managers and investors, have grown 
in the current low interest rate environment. 
One factor here is that a period in which funds 
search for yield may be followed by their ab -
ruptly offloading risky assets, and investors 
might have an incentive to redeem their fund 
shares more quickly than other investors 
(first-mover advantage).
Key features of the European 
market
A large part of the assets held by European in -
vestment funds (including money market funds) 
is managed by funds domiciled in the financial 
centres of Luxembourg and Ireland. The dom -
inance of these two financial centres has 
reached new levels in recent years, with their 
share of total net AuM climbing from around 
46% to 54% between early 2012 and June 
2019. At last count, funds domiciled in Ger -many and France accounted for 19% and 11%, 
respectively, of total euro area AuM.
The traditionally important role which financial 
centres play for the investment fund sector is 
likely to have been given an additional boost by 
the regulatory framework, particularly the 
UCITS (undertakings for collective investment 
in transferable securities) directive.6 This har -
monised set of EU rules makes it possible, for 
instance, to allocate a fund’s shares to multiple 
fund share classes. Share classes can differ in 
terms of currency, appropriation of income or 
front- end load. This allows certain investor 
groups to be selectively targeted and tax regu -Advantages of

6 The original UCITS directive dates back to 1985 and has 
since been amended several times. The purpose of the 
UCITS directive was to establish a single set of rules for in -
vestment funds and, in doing so, regulate the cross- border 
provision of investment funds. It was designed to ensure 
that providers of financial products in the EU remain com -
petitive and that investors have a wide range of financial 
products to choose from.Deutsche Bundesbank

lations to be taken into account. Another key 
feature of the UCITS directive is the European 
passport. This means that a fund domiciled in 
one EU country can be distributed and pur -
chased in another EU country. The European 
passport is therefore designed to further the 
goal of forging a single market for investment 
funds. The increased competition this sparked 
among fund companies is likely to have made 
financial centres more attractive. Financial 
centres that were relatively quick to transpose 
the UCITS directive into national law offer fa -
vourable conditions for funds. Empirical studies 
conducted on this topic show that they also 
benefit from fund- specific legislation, a well-  
established approval process and on- hand ex -
pertise.7
Another reason why financial centres have 
grown in importance is the increasing number 
of investors investing in cross- border funds, i.e. 
funds domiciled in a different jurisdiction than 
the investor. According to information provided 
by the European Fund and Asset Management 
Association (EFAMA), the assets managed by 
these funds as a share of total fund assets held 
by European investors have increased distinctly 
over the past few years to around one- third. To 
give some context to this share, which varies 
considerably between the individual European 
countries, it is important to note that it includes 
what are known as round- trip funds – funds 
which the management company sets up in a 
different Member State, but then markets ex -
clusively in the country in which it is estab -
lished.8 In some euro area countries, including 
Germany, round- trip funds of this nature 
–  which should be distinguished from “real” 
cross- border funds that are distributed in mul -
tiple countries – account for a relatively large 
proportion of cross- border funds held by in -
vestors.
Overall, the increase in the cross- border distri -
bution of European investment funds is indica -
tive of progressive market integration. How -
ever, this integration process is still incomplete, 
as shown, amongst other things, by the very high number of European investment funds, by 
international standards, with relatively low 
AuM levels on average.9 Incomplete integra -
tion limits the economies of scale which asset 
managers could generally achieve and is likely 
to have an unfavourable effect on the fund 
fees paid by investors. As the European Com -
mission sees it, regulatory barriers, which in -
clude national marketing requirements, regula -
tory fees, administrative requirements and noti -
fication requirements, represent a significant 
disincentive to cross-  border distribution.10 The 
capital markets union, which aims to deepen 
and integrate capital markets in the EU, is a 
major project in the fight to break down such 
barriers.
The financial accounts show each individual in -
stitutional sector’s exposure to investment 
funds. For funds domiciled in the euro area, 
such data are available starting in the fourth 
quarter of 2013. The most important groups of 
investors are European non- banks, above all 
other financial corporations – the category to 
which investment funds themselves belong –, 
insurance corporations and pension funds, as 
well as households (including non- profit institu -
tions serving households). Taken together, 
these three investor groups have purchased in -
vestment fund shares (excluding money market 
fund shares) worth €1,978 billion since the 
fourth quarter of 2013; this equates to around 
62% of net inflows to funds domiciled in the 
euro area (see the chart on p. 37). Other finan -
cial corporations as well as insurance corpor -
ations and pension funds stood out on account 
of their high exposures and, in the case of in -
surance corporations especially, the relatively 
steady increase in their investments. According 
to information provided by EFAMA, they fo -Growing import -

9 According to data provided by the International Invest -
ment Funds Association (IIFA), there were 48,439 invest -
ment funds domiciled in the euro area at the end of the 
first quarter of 2019, compared with 11,580 US funds.

cused on domestic funds. One reason for this is 
undoubtedly that insurance corporations and 
pension funds in Germany and Austria trad -
itionally invest to a larger extent in specialised 
funds. These funds, which are reserved for in -
stitutional investors and domiciled in the lat -
ter’s home country, usually manage capital for 
an individual investor or a small group of in -
vestors. In addition, insurance corporations 
– those in France, for example – play a highly 
important role in occupational pension schemes 
and, to this end, likewise invest heavily in do -
mestic funds.
Credit institutions resident in the euro area, 
many of which scaled back their holdings of 
investment fund shares in the immediate after -
math of the financial crisis, invested a relatively 
small amount of fresh capital (€64 billion). By 
contrast, investors outside the euro area in -
creased their portfolios of European investment 
fund shares significantly, adding €1,041 billion, 
or roughly one- third of total net inflows. They 
have expanded their exposures markedly, par -
ticularly since 2017. According to market obser -
vers, this demand was fuelled to a notable de -
gree by investors from Asia and Latin America, 
who were attracted to cross- border European 
funds for reasons of security and diversifica -
tion.
Compared to insurance corporations and pen -
sion funds, households (including non- profit in -
stitutions serving households) acquired far 
fewer investment fund shares; furthermore, for 
the most part, new investment dipped some -
what over time. Given that households accu -
mulated a relatively robust level of financial 
assets at the same time, this means that they 
preferred other financial assets such as, in par -
ticular, deposits with credit institutions, which 
made a stronger and more stable contribution 
to their accumulation of financial assets.The market for European 
bond funds
The strong growth recorded by the market for 
investment funds was also reflected in a marked 
rise in the significance of European bond funds: 
as this report went to press, they were man -
aging assets worth €3.4 trillion, compared to 
€1.9 trillion at the end of 2011. Although bond 
funds have not been investigated in as much 
detail as equity funds in the literature to date, 
they are of particular interest from a central 
bank perspective. This is because falling risk-  
free interest rates and a capital market environ -
ment of asset purchases by central banks have 
an especially strong bearing on these funds 
which invest primarily in debt securities – both 
in terms of their assets and the risk- return pro -
file of their range of investments. Funds are 
faced with various types of risk on the invest -
ment side: besides maturity and credit risk, 
these include liquidity risk, which materialises New investment

when their assets are relatively illiquid, but they 
themselves make their investors the usual guar -
antee that fund shares can be redeemed at any 
time. This liquidity mismatch between liabilities 
and assets is also referred to fund liquidity 
transformation. In the absence of adequate li -
quidity management, this mismatch leaves a 
fund susceptible to a run by investors, espe -
cially in periods of stress. The potential risk this 
poses to financial market stability is what 
makes it a relevant issue for central banks. Al -
though this concerns all funds managing il -
liquid assets, the following analysis focuses for 
the aforementioned reasons on European bond 
funds, looking at both their net inflows and 
asset management.
Net inflows to corporate bond 
funds and other bond funds
At €1.2 trillion, almost one- third of total net in -
flows to investment funds domiciled in the 
euro area since the start of 2012 have been 
registered by bond funds. Retail fund data from 
the private data provider Morningstar make it 
possible to gauge the extent to which corpor -
ate bond funds or other bond funds were the 
beneficiaries of this fresh capital.11 This is of 
interest from a central bank perspective in that 
corporate bond funds are often made up of il -
liquid assets. Furthermore, net inflows to funds 
with a focus on high- yield corporate bonds, in 
particular, allow inferences to be made about 
fund investors’ risk preference. For example, 
corporate bond funds and high- yield funds re -
corded relatively high net inflows, particularly 
until the second quarter of 2015 (see the chart 
on p. 42). These funds attracted strong invest -
ment from financial corporations (excluding 
banks), insurance corporations and pension 
funds as well as households, in particular. 
Whilst all three investor groups shunned cor -
porate bond funds for the most part in 2018, 
shares of other bond funds were added to the 
holdings of financial corporations (excluding 
banks) and insurers up to and through 2018.According to a Bundesbank analysis, the strong 
net inflows overall to bond funds can be ex -
plained in part by the decline in risk- free inter -
est rates since the beginning of 2012 and the 
funds’ positive performance (see the box on 
pp.  39-41). Moreover, the case of corporate 
bond funds shows that the investor inflows sig -
nificantly depend on the development of mar -
ket uncertainty and market participants’ gen -
eral risk aversion. The latter fell sharply in the 
period up to 2015. This is suggested by an ag -
gregate indicator, which can be estimated 
based on multiple separate risk indicators (see 
the explanatory notes on pp. 44 f.). A correl -
ation analysis confirms that net inflows to cor -
porate bond funds and high- yield bond funds, 
in particular, are negatively correlated with 
changes in general aversion to risk, while this 
correlation is less pronounced for other bond 
funds.12 In 2017, in particular, these other bond 
funds recorded substantial net inflows as risk 
aversion declined at a more measured pace. 
Heavier net outflows from corporate bond 
funds and other bond funds occurred during 
periods of mounting risk aversion as well as in 
the course of intermittent jumps worldwide in 
risk- free interest rates during what has been 
dubbed the US taper tantrum in mid-2013 (see 
also p. 45). The strong outflows in 2018 were 
probably driven in part by the deterioration of 
the capital market environment at that time 
amid growing concerns about the economy, 
falling equity prices and rising credit risks. These 
outflows took place against a backdrop of pre -
dominantly negative fund returns.Bond funds

funds and risk

11 Morningstar data indicate that net inflows to European 
bond funds since the start of 2012 came to €835 billion. 
One significant difference from the ECB investment fund 
statistics is that net inflows to specialised funds reserved for 
institutional investors are not included in this figure.
12 The correlation between (monthly) net inflows and 
changes in general risk aversion calculated for corporate 
bond funds and high- yield bond funds since the beginning 
of 2012 is -0.6; for other bond funds, this correlation 
comes to -0.3.Deutsche Bundesbank

Flow determinants of European bond funds
Investor fl  ows to European bond funds re-
spond to other (fi  nancial) variables. These 
response patterns can be systematically 
analysed by means of a panel estimation. 
Signifi  cant variables which potentially infl  u-
ence net fl  ows are, for example, the fund 
return recorded in the previous period, 
changes in the interest rate level and gen-
eral market uncertainty or risk aversion. 
Market liquidity, too, can be an important 
determinant of fund fl  ows. The panel is es-
timated using monthly data for the period 
from January 2012 to March 2019 on the 
basis of the above- mentioned variables.
One important fi  nding of the estimation is 
that the net infl  ow depends positively on 
the lagged fund return. Following negative 
returns, investors withdraw their capital 
from the bond funds; conversely, they ex-
pand their investment if the lagged return is 
positive. Assuming a one- percentage- point 
increase in the lagged fund return, bond 
funds exhibit a net infl  ow of roughly 0.2% 
of total net assets (coeffi   cient θ1 in the table 
on p. 40) if these are not corporate bond 
funds, and of approximately 0.3% (coeffi   -
cient sum  θ1 + θ2) if these are corporate 
bond funds. This relationship points to a 
momentum strategy on the part of invest-
ors. This strategy describes a behavioural 
pattern whereby investors respond posi-
tively to past returns and thus tend to re-
inforce market trends.
Changes in the interest rate level are a fur-
ther key determinant of fl  ows to European 
bond funds. According to the estimations, a 
decline in yields on ten- year Bunds was ac-
companied by infl  ows to bond funds. From 
an economic perspective, this can be ex-
plained by the fact that investors with a di-
minishing safe yield increasingly invested in alternative, higher- yield assets. Another ef-
fect caused by the interest rate level is the 
discount effect: a declining discount rate 
increases the market valuation of the bond 
portfolio and therefore also the contempor-
ary fund return, which can stimulate in-
fl  ows.1 In terms of monetary policy and fi  -
nancial stability, this estimated relationship 
is also of interest in that it provides indica-
tions as to how a potential future interest 
rate rise would infl  uence fund fl  ows. If one 
supposes – for the sake of simplicity – that 
the estimated sensitivities apply even in 
periods of an interest rate rise, and if one 
assumes an interest rate rise of 100 basis 
points combined with a 6% drop in the 
value of the fund’s portfolio,2 corporate 
bond funds would have to accept outfl  ows 
of 2.9% of their assets and other bond 
funds outfl  ows of 2.5% of their assets. This 
would result in total net assets shrinking by 
a total of 8.9% and 8.5%, respectively.3
Other macroeconomic determinants are 
market uncertainty –  as measured by the 
implied volatility of the German equity mar-
ket (VDAX) – and general risk aversion in 
the capital market (see the explanatory 
notes on pp. 44 f.). The corresponding, in 
each case negative estimation coeffi   cients 
for corporate bond funds show that invest-
ors expand (reduce) their investment in 
these funds in times of decreasing (increas-
ing) uncertainty or risk aversion. This result 
is consistent with the negative correlation

between the fl  ows of corporate and high- 
yield bond funds and general risk aversion. 
For other bond funds, however, such a rela-
tionship is not evident. This is likely to re-
fl  ect the fact that investors consider other 
bond funds that invest more heavily in gov-
ernment bonds less risky – because, if these 
are government bonds with high credit rat-
ings, their prices could even receive a boost 
in periods of stress on account of safe 
haven fl  ows.
In periods of heightened uncertainty, in-
vestors prefer safe and liquid bonds, such 
as Bunds. In periods of stress, this prefer-
ence for liquid assets prompts market par-
ticipants to require increasing compensa-
tion for an investment in debt securities 
with lower liquidity. In periods such as 
these, investors reduce their investment in 
corporate bond funds; conversely, corpor-
ate bond funds benefi  t from falling liquidity 
premiums. This is indicated by the impact of 
the yield spread between ten- year KfW 
bonds and Bunds with the same maturity, a 
common indicator for liquidity premiums. 
The estimation shows that this spread re-
lates negatively to the fl  ows to corporate 
bond funds. By contrast, other bond funds 
do not show a signifi  cant effect.
This panel estimation explicitly takes into 
account the time periods of two of the Euro-
system’s asset purchase programmes. The 
results suggest that investors invested 
somewhat less in bond funds when govern-
ment bond purchases under the public sec-
tor purchase programme (PSPP) began in 
March 2015 than they did previously. Mean-
while, a countervailing, partially compensa-
tory effect was apparent in the period from 
June 2016, during which the Eurosystem 
acquired corporate bonds under the cor-
porate sector purchase programme (CSPP). 
One possible interpretation of this fi  nding is 
that investment in funds with a focus on government bonds lost some of its appeal 
among fund investors after the launch of 
the PSPP owing to the already very low gov-
ernment bond yields, meaning that bond 
funds subsequently sold some of their hold-
ings of government bonds to the Eurosys-
tem (see the chart on p.  45). Conversely, 
the price gains recorded on corporate 
bonds after the launch of the CSPP could 
have prompted investors to expand their in-
direct investment in such bonds – which 
continued to exhibit a positive yield spread 
over safe bonds – via bond funds.Deutsche Bundesbank

Asset management  
of European bond funds
Recent studies show that the search for yield in 
financial markets is leaving a mark not only on 
the behaviour of fund investors but also on 
funds’ active asset management.13 In a study 
on US corporate bond funds, Choi and Kron -
lund (2018) find that fund managers have a 
greater tendency to shift their portfolios into 
riskier instruments if the level and slope of the 
yield curve are low and the yield spreads for 
taking on credit risk are slim. According to the 
literature, the search for yield has also intensi -
fied in German bond funds and mixed- mandate 
funds, with Barbu et al. (2019) showing that 
– unlike at the end of 2009 – a large propor -
tion of German specialised funds actively pur -
sued a yield- boosting strategy in their invest -
ment activities at the beginning of 2015. This 
usually involves taking on higher risks.
According to the ECB’s investment fund statis -
tics, European bond funds steadily increased 
their exposures to corporate bonds as risk- free 
interest rates declined. Since the beginning of 
2012, their share of all the debt securities is -
sued by euro area issuers has increased from 
around just over 25% to 38% at present. This 
contrasts with a drop in the share of govern -
ment bonds, which have been posting ever lower and sometimes even negative yields, in 
particular since early 2015; at last count, this 
share came to only 42% (see the chart on 
p. 45). The portfolio share of bank debt secur -
ities likewise fell perceptibly on balance: while 
these instruments had made up 26% of the 
bond portfolio in 2012, this share amounted to 
only 20% of late.
As the weight of corporate bonds in the fixed- 
income portfolios of European bond funds in -
creased, so, too, did the sensitivity of their re -
turns to price developments in the corporate 
bond market; the impact of European govern -
ment bond yields on fund performance, on the 
other hand, decreased. Bundesbank estimates 
based on a multifactor capital asset pricing 
model (CAPM) identify in particular a rise in 
sensitivity to high- yield corporate bonds, which 
indicates that the funds have larger exposures 
to such bonds (see the box on pp. 43-44).Search for yield

13 This conclusion is with regard to actively managed 
funds. By contrast, ETFs are, for the most part, passively 
managed index funds replicating a benchmark index. In the 
case of ETFs, then, the question is more whether they pose 
an additional risk compared with the individual securities in

Estimating a CAPM for European bond funds
A single- factor (unifactor) capital asset pri-
cing model (CAPM) describes a market 
equilibrium in which the expected return on 
a risky asset is made up of the risk- free re-
turn plus a risk premium. Under this model, 
the risk premium, which compensates the 
investor for taking on the non- diversifi  able 
systematic risk inherent in the asset, is equal 
to the market price of that risk, multiplied 
by the quantity of risk involved in the asset 
in question (beta factor). A multifactor 
CAPM, meanwhile, expands on the single- 
factor model by splitting the beta factor 
into multiple separate systematic beta fac-
tors. As a result, the expected return on the 
risky asset, as calculated using this multifac-
tor CAPM, is made up of the risk- free return 
plus several different risk premia, with the 
individual beta factors measuring the re-
spective systematic quantities of risk. Ap-
plied to the portfolio of an investment fund, 
the individual beta factors indicate the sen-
sitivity of the portfolio’s return to each of 
the risk factors. Seeing as this sensitivity is 
positively correlated with the weight of the 
risk factor in the portfolio, they can be in-
terpreted as a measure of the investment 
fund’s exposure to these risk factors.
To explore how sensitive the assets held in 
European bond funds are to (risky) govern-
ment and corporate bonds, this box will es-
timate the funds’ sensitivity using a multi-
factor CAPM. The bond funds’ realised 
monthly excess return over a risk- free asset 
is inputted into the model as a dependent 
variable. This excess return is the median re-
turn on European bond funds, less the re-
turn on Germany’s REX index for govern-
ment bonds. Three systematic risk factors 
have been chosen as independent variables 
in this model, these being relevant bench-
mark bond indices: one for European gov-ernment bonds, one for European invest-
ment grade corporate bonds, and one for 
European high- yield corporate bonds. The 
model is estimated over a rolling 24- month 
window. Based on this confi  guration, the 
time- varying beta coeffi   cients indicate the 
sensitivity of the excess return to each risk 
factor over this period.
The estimated beta factors suggest that the 
excess returns on European government 
bonds stopped contributing signifi  cantly to

The search for yield explained
One obvious explanation is that the search for 
yield by investment funds is closely linked to 
the increasingly entrenched low interest rate 
environment, just as it is for other (institutional) 
market participants. This section of the article 
analyses the extent to which this brisker de -
mand for higher- yield assets reflects a general 
shift in risk preferences in European financial 
markets. For this purpose, a measure of general 
risk appetite is calculated based on a principal 
component analysis of several individual indica -
tors which are relevant for risk assessments.14 
Over the observation period from 2012 on -
wards, this indicator has recorded mainly nega -
tive values since roughly 2014, when interest 
rates began to decline sharply; this suggests 
that market participants’ risk aversion was 
below- average or their risk appetite was above- 
average. The indicator’s subsequent predomin -
antly sideways movement is indicative of rela -
tively strong demand for risk- bearing assets since then. Both developments taken together 
indicate that the search for yield on the part of 
investment funds largely reflects the increase in 
financial market participants’ general risk appe -
tite.
Another factor which is bound to have indir -
ectly fuelled this greater risk appetite was the 
non- standard monetary policy measures, as 
shown by the increased importance of the 
portfolio rebalancing channel of monetary 
 policy transmission. This is understood as the 
relationship in portfolio theory between mon -
etary policy measures and investor behaviour. 
According to this transmission channel, a lower 
risk- free interest rate induced by monetary 
 policy measures reduces the return on a risk-  
free asset and simultaneously makes borrowing 
more attractive as a result of financing costs Investment 
funds’ search for 
yield largely 
reflects general 
risk appetite
Non- standard 
monetary policy 
increases incen -
tive for risky 
investmentbond funds’ median return (in excess of the 
risk- free return) following the sharp decline 
in the risk- free rate up until the spring of 
2015 (see the chart on p. 43). Instead, the 
funds’ returns were initially driven above all 
by the excess returns on corporate bonds. 
Between mid-2017 and the beginning of 
this year, the only remaining signifi  cant in-
fl  uence identifi  ed by the model comes 
(temporarily) from excess returns on high- 
yield corporate bonds; towards the end of 
the observation period, however, invest-
ment grade corporate bonds also began to 
contribute signifi  cantly to returns once 
more. Viewed in aggregate, these fi  ndings 
are consistent with the observation that the 
funds have shifted their (relative) holdings 
away from (risky) European government 
bonds into corporate bonds and stepped 
up their exposure to high- yield corporate 
bonds in particular.

being pushed down. This shifts the efficient 
frontier for all manner of assets.15 In the new 
equilibrium, the optimal portfolio, from an in -
vestor’s perspective, will then exhibit a higher 
level of risk. This effect is amplified further if 
non- standard monetary policy accommodation 
is accompanied by lower financial market vola -
tility. Taken together, declining interest rates 
and reduced financial market volatility thus rep -
resent an incentive for investors to shift their 
portfolios into riskier assets.
Besides general risk appetite, the asset man -
agement of (actively managed) bond funds is 
likely to reflect other fund manager incentives 
as well. Ultimately, these incentives come about 
because fund investors delegate their own in -
vestment decisions to funds and, in return, 
often rank fund managers relative to other 
funds. Rivalry with other funds and fund man -
agers’ desire to have a good ranking can, 
therefore, also influence their portfolio deci -
sions. On the one hand, this may reinforce 
managers’ risk appetite. On the other hand, 
however, it can also – in combination with a 
restrictive monetary policy measure – lead to a 
reversal in managers’ search for yield and even 
contribute to them abruptly selling off risky 
assets.16 In this context, Feroli et al. (2014) 
present a theoretical model in which an in -
crease in the risk- free short- term interest rate 
beyond a certain threshold can lead to an ab -
rupt correction of risk premia if the fund man -
agers previously stepped up their exposure to 
risk- bearing, high- yield assets for fear of receiv -
ing a bad performance ranking. This enables 
even unlevered funds to exert destabilising ef -
fects on financial markets.
One example of abrupt outflows from bond 
funds following monetary policy- induced price 
losses in capital markets is the US taper tan -
trum of May 2013. This term describes the 
surge in US Treasury yields after the Federal Re -
serve’s announcement in May 2013 to reduce 
(taper) the pace of quantitative easing going 
forward. At the time, bond fund investors on 
both sides of the Atlantic responded by making large- scale withdrawals. By contrast, the sud -
den rise in Bund yields in spring 2015 (the Bund 
tantrum), which was virtually unaffected by 
monetary policy expectations, triggered no 
prominent outflows from European bond 
funds.
Recent empirical studies support the view that 
the expansionary monetary policy observed in 
the past few years provided an incentive for in -
vestors to shift their portfolios into riskier, Rivalry with

higher-  yielding paper.17 According to Abbassi 
and Schmidt (2019), German investment funds 
exhibit a tendency, when interest rates are low, 
to give bonds with low ratings and corporate 
bonds a stronger weighting in their portfolios 
and also to increase their exposure to securities 
with longer maturities. In addition, the Inter -
national Monetary Fund points out that the 
low interest rate environment has prompted in -
vestment funds to invest more in less liquid 
financial  assets.18 The bid- ask spread of debt 
securities held by German bond funds, for in -
stance, shows that the illiquidity differential be -
tween corporate bond holdings and holdings 
of other debt instruments has risen since 2012.
Trend reinforced by illiquidity
Overall, then, the search for yield by European 
bond funds is likely to have pushed up the 
weight of corporate bonds and other relatively 
illiquid securities in their portfolios. This also 
leaves the funds more vulnerable to liquidity 
risk, because generally speaking, funds which 
invest more in illiquid assets run the risk of in -
curring higher liquidation costs in the event of 
outflows. This is particularly true when the 
funds hold large stocks of illiquid securities, be -
cause adverse market developments can be 
amplified by trend- reinforcing mechanisms – a drop in market valuations, and thus in the 
fund’s portfolio return, will be reflected in a 
lower redemption price for fund shares. Invest -
ors pursuing a momentum strategy (see the 
box on pp. 39-41) will respond to this by with -
drawing their capital, potentially forcing the 
fund manager to liquidate assets, unless these 
outflows can be financed by other means, such 
as out of the fund’s cash holdings.
If fund managers need to sell off less liquid 
assets to meet redemptions, the remaining 
fund investors might be exposed to additional 
losses because illiquid assets can only be sold in 
the market at a discount. Given the typical re -
demption modalities in retail funds, these costs 
are not normally borne by the investors with -
drawing from the fund but by the remaining 
shareholders. Strategic investors anticipating 
this risk of loss therefore generally have an in -
centive to withdraw their capital early. Such 
illiquidity- induced outflows can particularly 
have a bearing if the liquidation value of fund 
shares decreases over time. In this case, invest -
ors will have an incentive to redeem their fund 
shares earlier than other shareholders (first-  
mover advantage). Compounding this issue in 
times of stress is the fact that illiquidity- induced 
outflows affect market prices, particularly in 
relatively illiquid markets, potentially triggering 
feedback effects on fund flows.19
The mechanism described above implies that 
funds with illiquid portfolios can become ex -
posed to self- reinforcing outflows. That said, 
fund managers can influence and control this 
risk to a degree by managing the funds’ liquid - Liquidity risks in

17 See European Central Bank (2017), p. 97, which writes 
that investment funds scaled back their exposure to euro 
area government bonds by around 10% and trimmed their 
holdings of bank debt securities by 6%. At the same time, 
they stepped up their holdings of securities from borrowers 
outside the euro area. Moreover, Cenedese and Elard 
(2018) and Bubeck et al. (2018) find evidence suggesting 
that fund managers have reduced their assets from coun -
tries conducting unconventional monetary policy and in -
creased their investment in other countries.

Corporate bond funds: the role of liquidity and ownership 
structure
Recent years have seen European investment 
funds allocate an increasing share of their 
assets to corporate bonds. One reason for 
this will undoubtedly have been the decline 
in interest rates, which amplifi  ed the incen-
tive to search for yield and thus stimulated 
demand for higher- yielding, but also riskier 
debt instruments. Although the supply of 
corporate bonds also registered an increase 
over the same period, the brisker demand 
narrowed their yield spreads. This drove up 
liquidity risk in the portfolios of bond funds 
because corporate bonds tend to be less li-
quid than (high- volume) government bonds.
The literature notes that investment funds 
can be exposed to stronger withdrawals in 
periods of stress if the liquidity of their 
assets is low. Fund managers looking to fi  -
nance such outfl  ows can use their available 
cash holdings, draw on any credit facilities 
they might have, or sell off fund assets.
If a fund manager uses cash or sells liquid se-
curities –  such as AAA- rated government 
bonds – to accommodate investor redemp-
tions, the transaction costs will be relatively 
low, which would also mitigate the down-
ward pressure on valuations of the remainder 
of the portfolio.1 At the same time, that 
would, however, risk worsening the fund’s 
portfolio liquidity on a permanent basis if the 
fund manager is unable to acquire new liquid 
assets due to a lack of fresh infl  ows of cap-
ital. In turn, an increasingly illiquid portfolio 
risks inducing further outfl  ows if the fund’s 
investors lose confi  dence in the manager’s 
commitment to keep the fund liquid and fully 
meet redemptions (which might be triggered 
if the fund performs badly).2 This is due to 
the fact that dwindling liquidity makes it 
more costly to convert fund assets into cash. 
In this case, the fund would no longer be able to accommodate all the shareholders’ 
claims if all its assets were liquidated, assum-
ing unit prices remain unchanged. Investors 
might therefore have an incentive to redeem 
their fund shares earlier than other share-
holders. Such an incentive arises when the 
liquidation value of fund shares shrinks as in-
vestors hesitate to redeem. Accordingly, in-
vestors who withdraw from the fund quickly 
would have a fi  rst- mover advantage. Against 
this background, Goldstein et al. (2017) argue 
that an illiquid bond portfolio creates incen-
tives for strategic investor behaviour and in-
creased outfl  ows when fund performance is 
poor. In addition, the fi  rst- mover advantage 
will be amplifi  ed if the fund meets outfl  ows 
by fi  rst selling its relatively liquid security 
holdings. This is because the return of early 
redeemers is higher than that of investors 
who stay invested in the fund for longer and 
thus shoulder more outfl  ow- induced losses.
According to the literature, this amplifi  ca-
tion mechanism does not apply to all illiquid 
funds in equal measure. Research on US 
and German corporate bond funds has 
found that the proportion of institutional 
investors in a fund dictates the extent to 
which it will be affected by withdrawals.3,4 
1 See Choi and Shin (2016).
2 Cases have been observed in the past where funds 
with illiquid assets were forced to suspend redemp-
tions in critical situations or because of their invest-
ment strategy. Redemption gates or gating provisions 
are the names given to measures introduced to sus-
pend, at least temporarily, redemptions of fund shares 
by open- end funds.

(2019).
4 Dötz and Weth (2019) use data from the Bundes-
bank’s investment fund statistics in combination with 
information from the Eurosystem’s securities holdings 
statistics for the period from November 2009 until 
June 2016. In line with the literature and theoretical 
considerations on strategic investor behaviour, they

This research demonstrated that a shortage 
of liquid assets combined with a poor per-
formance will trigger heavier outfl  ows from 
predominantly retail- based funds than from 
those held chiefl  y by institutional investors.5 
It is a phenomenon which can be traced 
back to differences in liquidation costs: if a 
retail investor withdraws from a fund and a 
small volume of securities need to be sold 
at a discount, only the remaining share-
holders will bear the costs associated with 
the discount. The retail investor withdraw-
ing from the fund, however, benefi  ts from 
the fi  rst-mover advantage. By contrast, if a 
major institutional investor makes large- 
scale withdrawals from a fund, the cost of 
generating the necessary liquidity cannot 
be passed on in full to the remaining invest-
ors but will have to be borne, at least in 
part, by the withdrawing institutional in-
vestor. This will make institutional investors 
more reluctant to withdraw from illiquid 
funds at their own expense. Evidence for 
German corporate bond funds suggests 
that outfl  ows from institutional funds in re-
sponse to poor performance are only ever 
signifi  cant if those funds are suffi   ciently 
liquid  – that is to say, if it costs them little or 
nothing to liquidate fund assets.
The empirical evidence indicating that a 
fund’s vulnerability to outfl  ows depends on 
its investor structure raises the question of 
whether liquidity management also differs 
between retail- based funds and institutional- 
oriented funds. Generally speaking, the ap-
proach of fi  rst selling liquid assets to ac-
commodate fund outfl  ows (i.e. basing sales 
on a liquidity pecking order) offers the ad-
vantage of low transaction costs. On the 
downside, though, this leaves an increas-
ingly illiquid residual portfolio, particularly 
when outfl  ows are high. So how do funds 
trade off these pros and cons? Not only 
does an illiquid residual portfolio increase 
the risk of having to sell illiquid securities at some point in the future, it also means that 
replenishing liquid assets will come at a cost 
if the fund fails to attract infl  ows of capital. 
This can be problematic in times of elevated 
market uncertainty.6 From the investor’s 
point of view, the risk that the fund might 
have to sell illiquid assets makes it more 
advantageous  to withdraw from the fund 
early, and it can contribute to a run.7
From the fund manager’s perspective, the 
amount and likelihood of future outfl  ows 
depend on both fundamentals and the li-
quidity of the portfolio. Liquidity here is not 
exogenously given, but is managed and tar-
geted by the fund manager. This conjecture 
has been investigated in two recent studies, 
both of which identify the key role played 
by market uncertainty in determining 
whether a fund manager will sell off secur-
ities according to a liquidity pecking order 
or aim instead to preserve portfolio liquidity 
by selling illiquid assets proportionally. Jiang 
et al. (2017) conclude for US corporate 
bond funds that fund managers exposed to 
outfl  ows prefer to sell liquid fi  nancial instru-
ments during tranquil market conditions 
but prioritise liquidity preservation in spells 
of heightened uncertainty. Dötz and Weth 
(2019), meanwhile, highlight the role played 
by the investor base in German corporate 
bond funds. They show that the share of 
institutional investors is pivotal not just for 
investor fl  ows, but also for differences in 
the way a fund’s liquidity is managed. Ac-
cording to their research, managers of 
5 Estimates by Dötz and Weth (2019) indicate that an 
assumed negative fund return of -5% will trigger out-
fl  ows from illiquid funds of between 3.0% and 4.3% 
of the assets under management in the case of retail- 
based funds. Underperforming funds held primarily by 
institutional investors, by contrast, have more reason 
to fear outfl  ows when liquidity levels are high: assum-
ing a fund return of -5%, the outfl  ows here come to 
between 2.5% and 3.2% of their fund assets.

Chernenko and Sunderam (2016) as well as Coudert 
and Salakhova (2019).

ity. Two key liquidity management tools are 
cash reserves and highly liquid government 
bonds. Another is active liquidity management 
in the remainder of the investment portfolio as 
a precautionary measure against a potential 
illiquidity- induced sell- off. Fund managers’ con -
siderations here include weighing up the extent 
to which they will sell off securities according 
to a liquidity pecking order, if need be, to fi -
nance outflows. These relationships are ex -
plored in the box on pp. 47-49, using the Ger -
man market for bond funds as an example. The 
box also discusses the degree to which the 
strategic incentive for investors to withdraw 
their capital early on depends on them being 
retail or institutional investors. It appears that, 
in periods of stress, managers of retail- based 
funds mainly strive to preserve portfolio liquid -
ity, whereas the priority for managers of 
institutional- oriented funds is to avoid transac -
tion costs.Conclusion
Assets managed by investment funds have 
risen sharply worldwide in recent years, in a re -
flection of the general ascendancy of capital 
markets as a source of funding and investment 
opportunities since the financial crisis. There is 
also evidence that cross- border funds are gain -
ing in importance in the European market for 
investment funds. The marked increase in 
assets under management in European funds 
can be traced back to perceptible net inflows 
from institutional investors in particular, but it 
also reflects increases in value fuelled by share 
price gains and the declining and sometimes 
even negative risk- free interest rates observed 
in recent years. With €3.4 trillion in assets 
under management at last count, European 
bond funds showed signs of being affected by 
the increasingly entrenched low interest rate 
environment, both in terms of their net inflows 
and their portfolio management. Thus, the 
Bundesbank has estimated that the dwindling retail- based funds will tend, in times of 
stress, to preserve portfolio liquidity by sell-
ing securities of different liquidity propor-
tionally (pro rata). Given the strategic be-
haviour of investors in retail- based funds, 
such a pro rata selling strategy can be inter-
preted as an incentive to avoid accelerated 
withdrawals induced by shrinking liquidity 
levels. Their paper found that, unlike retail- 
based funds, institutional- oriented funds 
have less reason to fear illiquidity- driven 
outfl  ows: it turns out that they fi  nance out-
fl  ows in periods of stress mainly by selling 
liquid assets. In so doing, they save transac-
tion costs but accept a deterioration in 
portfolio liquidity. This fi  nding can be ex-
plained by the fact that these funds are less 
vulnerable to illiquidity- induced outfl  ows.
In conclusion, then, it can be said that own-
ership structure and fund liquidity do not 
only affect the relationship between fl  ows and fund performance – the fund’s investor 
base also helps explain which securities the 
fund manager will sell to accommodate 
withdrawals. The different responses shown 
by illiquid retail- based and institutional- 
oriented funds are due to differences in 
their respective vulnerability to strategic in-
vestor behaviour: a fund held mainly by re-
tail investors is more at risk of outfl  ows. This 
is because the common redemption modal-
ities tend to favour investors who redeem 
their fund shares early and can pass on the 
costs resulting from the sale of illiquid se-
curities to the fund’s remaining sharehold-
ers. This strategy is more readily available to 
retail investors with small investments than 
to institutional investors with large expos-
ures.Deutsche Bundesbank

Bund yields helped buoy investors’ propensity 
to invest in bond funds, while portfolio man -
agement in these funds has been increasingly 
driven by a search for yield since 2012. Re -
search on this topic suggests that many funds 
rebalanced their portfolios more strongly into 
risk- bearing, less liquid and longer-  dated debt 
securities during this period. In their portfolios 
of European bonds, funds reduced the weights 
of government bonds and bank debt securities 
and switched into corporate bonds, thereby driving up liquidity risks on their assets side. 
More recent analyses see this mainly as an 
issue for retail funds with a large number of 
small- scale investors, given that such funds are 
especially vulnerable to outflows in periods of 
falling prices if their portfolios are illiquid. This 
highlights the major importance of actively 
managing portfolio liquidity as a way of pre -
venting illiquidity- induced, self- reinforcing out -
flows.

Long- term outlook for the statutory 
 pension insurance scheme
Over the past few years, the financial situation of the statutory pension insurance scheme has 
been relatively free of tension. This was due to past reforms, a pause in demographic change, 
and positive developments on the labour market. The contribution rate decreased and several 
benefits were expanded. Demographic developments will be putting pension funding under pres -
sure in future, however. Life expectancy is likely to go on rising and the large baby boomer 
cohorts will be entering retirement from the mid-2020s onwards. The Federal Government is 
aiming for a long- term pension reform.
Long- term projections are important for this – despite all the uncertainty involved. They highlight 
key developments and illustrate how reforms, from a current vantage point, are going to affect 
persons covered by the statutory pension insurance scheme and taxpayers. Projections of this 
kind are presented here. They demonstrate how the key variables of the statutory pension insur -
ance scheme are correlated: the statutory retirement age, the replacement rate, the contribution 
rate and government funds.
The simulations make it clear that it is all but impossible to capture future demographic burdens 
in a convincing manner using only single variables. Even today, burdens are being spread more 
broadly under the current regulations. By the early 2030s, the statutory retirement age will have 
been raised to 67, for example. One approach to reform would be linking (indexing) the retire -
ment age systematically to increasing life expectancy. This is also suggested by international 
organisations. For example, the statutory retirement age could be raised after 2030 so that the 
ratio of years in retirement and years of contributions remains broadly stable (instead of con -
stantly increasing as would be the case extrapolating from the current situation). Increasing life 
expectancy would then be tied to a longer period of employment, although the period of pension 
payment would also become longer. To this end, the statutory retirement age would have to rise 
to 69⅓ by 2070. Any resulting more extensive employment would also bolster social security con -
tributions and taxes. Moreover, with a rising retirement age and the associated longer periods of 
work, pension entitlements would increase. It would therefore make sense to dynamically adjust 
the standardised replacement rate – in other words, to include more years of contributions in the 
standard pension in line with the increasing retirement age.
If increasing life expectancy were taken into account in this way by raising the statutory retire -
ment age, this would still leave the financial pressure caused by the lower birth rates since the 
1970s unaddressed. The existing regulations distribute this pressure among the other variables: 
even with an indexed retirement age, the contribution rate and government funds would rise 
relatively sharply up to around 2040 and the calculated dynamically adjusted replacement rate 
would fall. There would be much less need for adjustment, however. After 2040, the dynamically 
adjusted replacement rate with a correspondingly greater number of contribution years would 
tend to move sideways.
Acceptance of the pension insurance scheme depends, not least, on the replacement rate being 
considered to be adequate. If consideration were given to a longer- term minimum threshold, it Deutsche Bundesbank

would seem reasonable to aim for a dynamically adjusted replacement rate as described. It is 
also an integral part of a reliable outlook that the resulting financial burdens appear sustainable. 
Even without an additional minimum threshold as reinforcement, such burdens are likely to 
increase considerably on those subject to compulsory contributions as well as on the federal 
budget.
Introduction
The statutory pension insurance scheme is the 
most important pillar of old- age provision in 
Germany, accounting for roughly three- quarters 
of all incomes from pension schemes.1 The 
Federal Government has announced a major 
reform for the middle of the next decade. The 
Kommission verlässlicher Generationenvertrag 
(“Commission for a reliable intergenerational 
contract”) is to have made preparations for this 
by March 2020. The following sections will first 
provide a brief overview of the statutory pen -
sion insurance scheme and developments in it 
over the past decade. The long- term outlook 
will then be considered in greater detail. Nu -
merous other aspects of the pension policy de -
bate, such as a minimum level of provision, the 
role of additional occupational and private 
pensions and the civil service pension scheme 
are not discussed.2
Basic features of the 
 statutory pension insurance 
scheme
The statutory pension insurance scheme is or -
ganised as a pay- as- you- go system. This means 
that the receipts of a given year directly fund 
the expenditure of that same year. Receipts 
come mainly from contributions on income 
subject to compulsory contributions (chiefly 
gross wages and salaries up to the maximum 
social security contribution threshold).3 Added 
to this are central government payments, 
which are financed from tax receipts.4 The 
statutory pension insurance scheme is not 
allowed to go into debt. Rather, a reserve is to 
be maintained in order to prevent intra- year li -
quidity shortages. At the end of the year, this should be between 0.2 to 1.5 times the aver -
age monthly expenditure (after deduction of 
government funds). The contribution rate is ad -
justed if it is anticipated that the figure will not 
fall within this range. It currently stands at 
18.6% and is capped at a maximum of 20% 
until 2025. Until then, any funding gap would 
have to be offset by additional government 
funds.
The individual old- age pension essentially de -
pends on the contributions paid beforehand 
(participation equivalence). What is crucial in 
this context is the relative income position, i.e. 
the ratio of an individual’s own earnings sub -
ject to compulsory insurance to the average 
earnings of all persons covered by the statutory 
pension insurance scheme. The insurance 
scheme members collect earnings points with 
their contributions every year, reflecting this 
ratio. If the individual’s own earnings match 
the average, precisely one earnings point is ac -
quired in the year in question. The sum of the 
earnings points acquired during a working life 
thus reflects two things: the average relative Public old- age

3 In 2019 the annual social security contribution threshold 
is €80,700 in western Germany and €73,800 in eastern 
Germany. Contributions are also paid for persons receiving 
unemployment or sickness benefit. The public long- term 
care insurance scheme pays pension insurance contribu -
tions for relatives who act as carers, and the Federal Gov -
ernment pays pension insurance contributions for parents 
with children below the age of three years. These contribu -
tions give rise to matching pension entitlements: in the 
event of illness or unemployment depending on previous 
income, for relatives who act as carers depending on the 
degree and extent of care, and for parents at a flat rate for 
each of the first three years of the child’s life.
4 Along with other provisions, about two- thirds of the gov -
ernment funds are linked to growth in per capita earnings 
and changes in the contribution rate. The other govern -
ment funds change, first and foremost, with the total wage 
bill and developments in turnover tax revenue (excluding 
rate changes).Deutsche Bundesbank

Defi  nition of key terms in the pension debate: 
 pension  formula, standard pension, replacement rate 
and pension adjustment
Pension formula
The monthly pension R is calculated using the 
following formula (sections 69 and 70 of the 
Sixth Book of the Social Security Code (Sechs-
tes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch)):
R = EP * ZF * ARW * RAF
– EP is the sum of the accumulated earnings 
points. Contributors to the pension insur-
ance scheme acquire earnings points on an 
annual basis of their contributions. The 
number of points credited per year de-
pends on the ratio of the individual scheme 
member’s earnings (subject to compulsory 
insurance) to the average earnings of all 
members of the statutory pension insur-
ance scheme in the year in question. 
Where a person’s own earnings corres-
pond to the average, precisely one earn-
ings point is acquired.
– ZF is the retirement access factor, which 
comprises deductions for early retirement 
(0.3% for each month) or add- ons for 
postponed retirement (0.5% for each 
month).
– ARW  denotes the pension value, which is 
adjusted every year on 1 July (see annual 
pension adjustment). For eastern Germany, 
a special pension value will apply until 
2024.
– RAF stands for the type of pension drawn. 
The pension type factor amounts, for ex-
ample, to 1 for old- age pensions or 0.6 for 
pensions for older surviving dependents.
Standard pension
The standard pension is a benchmark fre-
quently used for comparisons. It results when 
members of the statutory pension insurance 
scheme, fi  rst, retire at the statutory retirement age, second, have contributed to the scheme 
for 45 years, and third, every year have re-
ceived earnings subject to compulsory insur-
ance corresponding to the average earnings 
of all scheme members.
Multiplied by the pension value (at present 
€33.05 in western Germany and €31.89 in 
eastern Germany), this generates a monthly 
standard pension of €1,487.25 in western 
Germany and €1,435.05 in eastern Germany, 
in each case before taxes and social security 
contributions.
Replacement rate
The replacement rate refl  ects the ratio of the 
standard pension (in western Germany) to 
average employee earnings subject to com-
pulsory insurance.1 Both variables are based 
on the level before taxes, but after deduction 
of the respective social security contributions 
due (pension: half of the health insurance 
contribution rate and full contribution rate for 
long- term care insurance; earnings: half of the 
contribution rates for the health, long- term 
care, unemployment and pension insurance 
schemes).
Replacement rate =standard pension social security contributions
average earnings social security contributions
The calculated replacement rate amounts to 
48.1% for 2019. The standard pension is, 
therefore, just under half as high as the aver-
age earnings of all employees covered by the 
statutory pension insurance scheme (after de-
duction of social security contributions).
Taxation and thus the replacement rate after 
taxes differs according to individual circum-
stances. In this vein, taxation varies depending

contributions to the social security scheme) were

Germany in 2018.Deutsche Bundesbank

on the retirement year as the taxable share of 
new pensions is growing from year to year.2 
By contrast, the tax- free share of pension con-
tributions is likewise growing from year to 
year. In the case of retirement in 2019, the 
taxable share of the pension is 78%. For re-
tirement from 2040 onwards, the pension will 
be fully taxable. Moreover, in some instances, 
the tax burden depends on numerous other 
factors (type of tax assessment, other income, 
deduction amounts). At present, the replace-
ment rate upon retirement, after taxes (ex-
cluding any other income and child benefi  t 
claims), is likely to be roughly just under 
10 percentage points higher than the pre- tax 
level.3
Annual pension adjustment
In principle, the annual pension adjustment is 
determined by three factors: fi  rst, the rate of 
change in the average employee’s earnings 
subject to compulsory contributions, second, 
the change in the pension insurance scheme 
contribution rate and in contributions paid 
into assumed supplementary private pension 
provision, and third, the sustainability factor. 
Earnings are calculated separately for western 
Germany and eastern Germany. All other fac-
tors are based on uniform national values.
The specifi  c adjustment formula is as follows 
(section 68 of the Sixth Book of the Social Se-
curity Code):
ARW t=ARW t1⇤BE t1
BE t2⇤bBEt2
bBEt3/BEt2

⇤100−AV A t1−RV B t1
100−AV A t2−RV B t2
⇤ ⇣
1−RQ t1
RQ t2⌘
⇤↵+1!
In the above equation
– ARW  denotes the pension value. This 
transforms claims in the form of earnings 
points into defi  nite euro amounts.
– BE refers to gross wages and salaries per 
employee.– bBE indicates earnings subject to compul-
sory contributions per employee (excluding 
civil servants and including recipients of 
unemployment benefi  t).
– AVA  is the contribution paid into a supple-
mentary private pension scheme, which re-
fl  ects the contribution envisaged for the in 
part state- funded additional “Riester” pen-
sion scheme (unchanged at 4% since 
2012).
– RVB  denotes the pension insurance 
scheme contribution rate.
– RQ is the pensioner ratio, which is the 
ratio of the number of calculated standard 
pensions to the number of calculated aver-
age contributions, and α denotes a sensi-
tivity parameter which is set at 0.25. 
Changes in the pensioner ratio thus affect 
the pension adjustment by up to one quar-
ter.
The fi  nal results regarding the development of 
the average contribution- relevant bBE  are 
available only with a delay of just over one 
year. Therefore, the rate of increase in BE as 
shown by the previous year’s national ac-
counts is fi  rst used provisionally for the re-
spective mid- year adjustment. Going forward, 
this is then adjusted with a time lag to bBE  
development by means of a correction factor 
(correction by the ratio of the development in 
bBE to BE two years previously).
2 In practice, the tax- free pension share is calculated 
as a euro amount in the year in which a person enters 
retirement and is then kept constant. As a result, 
future pension increases will be fully taxable.

earnings position and the length of the contri -
bution period. The contributions made are the 
basis for the individual pension entitlement. 
Unlike in the case of tax payments, pension 
contributions are accompanied by specifically 
attributable benefits provided by central gov -
ernment. In contrast to statutory health insur -
ance and the long- term care insurance scheme, 
the benefits depend on the amount of previ -
ously paid contributions.
Old- age pensions account for the vast majority 
(most recently, around 78%) of the statutory 
pension insurance scheme’s pension expend -
iture. Moreover, pensions for persons with re -
duced earnings capacity accounted for about 
7% and surviving dependents’ pensions ac -
counted for roughly 15%.5 When retirement 
begins upon reaching the statutory retirement 
age, the individual old- age pension is given by 
the product of the earnings points acquired 
and the pension value.6 The pension value is 
updated using the pension adjustment for -
mula. This is geared, first of all, to growth in 
wages. Besides other factors, it also takes due 
account of burdens resulting from social secur -
ity contributions and a demographic factor (see 
also the box on pp. 55-56).
In the public debate, the coverage provided by 
the statutory pension insurance scheme is fre -
quently measured by the pre-  tax net replace -
ment rate. Roughly speaking, this captures the 
pension entitlement in relation to previous in -
come. Specifically, this is the ratio of a standard 
pension to current average earnings, with the 
relevant social security contributions being de -
ducted (see the box on pp. 55-56). Standard 
pension denotes a pension after 45 years of 
contributions with average pay (i.e. 45 earnings 
points). Defined in this way, the replacement 
rate is currently at just over 48%. Until 2025, a 
minimum threshold of 48% applies.Looking back at trends since 
20087
Following financially difficult times, the statu -
tory pension insurance scheme has been bene -
fiting for some years now from favourable 
underlying conditions and earlier reforms. 
There has been an improvement, in particular, 
in the labour market situation: unemployment 
has fallen, and there has been strong growth in 
employment, especially in old age. Added to 
this was a pause in the demographically in -
duced pressure on expenditure, as the post-  
war cohorts reaching retirement age were 
comparatively weakly populated. The economic 
crisis of 2009 and the economic dip around 
2013 had only a short and limited impact. The 
fact that the statutory pension insurance 
scheme was in good shape made it easier for 
benefits to be expanded again from 2014 on -
wards, including retirement on a full pension at 
the age of 63 for those with a very long contri -
bution history and “mothers’ pensions”. Des -Pensions

pite such additional expenditure, the contribu -
tion rate has fallen in several stages since 2012 
from 19.9% to 18.6% most recently. Neverthe -
less, the reserve saw an increase on balance 
and, at the end of 2018, was at just under 1.8 
times the scheme’s monthly expenditure.
The receipts of the statutory pension insurance 
scheme benefited, above all, from the favour -
able developments on the labour market. The 
number of compulsorily insured employees 
grew by 5 million in the period from 2008 to 
2017. This corresponds to an increase of almost 
20%, or just under 2% on an annual average. 
Contribution receipts rose by an average of 
nearly 3%, which was weaker than the growth 
in the total wage bill (just over 3½%). This was 
due chiefly to the fact that the contribution 
rate fell by 1.3 percentage points.8 The higher 
contribution receipts were due, not least, to a 
significantly higher labour force participation 
rate among older persons. Between 2007 and 
2018, the employment rate among persons 
aged 60 to 64 years doubled to 60%.9 Govern -
ment funds (central government grants and 
contributions for child- raising periods) grew at 
a slightly slower pace. Their share of total re -
ceipts fell compared with 2007, but it was still 
more than one quarter at the end of the period 
under review. The main reason for this was that 
two- thirds of government funds for the statu -
tory pension insurance scheme are linked to 
per capita earnings. If employment grows, the 
government funds increase less strongly than 
contribution receipts, which depend on the 
total wage bill.
As a result of the positive situation on the la -
bour market and the rising statutory retirement 
age since 2012, the actual commencement age 
for old- age pensions has also increased signifi -
cantly to 64 years on average since 2007 (+7 
months since 2007). The increase would have 
been higher still if the possibility of retirement 
on a full pension at the age of 63 had not been 
introduced in 2014. Moreover, the expenditure 
side has also benefited from the pension re -
forms over the past decade and the demo -graphic pause. Overall, the number of pension 
recipients has increased by just over 1 million 
since 2007, or ½% on an annual average. Pen -
sion expenditure rose at an average of 2½%, 
which is weaker than growth in contribution 
receipts.

the last decade mainly dampened pension ad -

by the Federal Employment Agency decreased as a result of 
falling unemployment. Since 2011, no pension contribu -
tions have been paid for recipients of unemployment bene -
fit II, either.

10 At the same time, the funded supplementary individual 
old- age pension provision scheme (“Riester” pension) was 
boosted more strongly using tax revenue. Occupational 
pensions were also increasingly promoted during this 
period. The aim of this is that supplementary funded pri -

from 65 to 67 between 2012 and 2031.11 Early 
retirement was also made more difficult. The 
reduced pension adjustments, as well as the 
higher contributions for the long- term care in -
surance scheme led to a fall in the replacement 
rate. Starting from 51.3% in 2007, the replace -
ment rate dropped to 48.1% last year. The posi -
tive developments in employment bolstered 
the replacement rate through the sustainability 
factor in the pension formula. This is designed 
to limit the rise in the pension contribution rate 
in the wake of demographic change. In prin -
ciple, this has the effect of pensions growing 
more slowly if there is an increase in the ratio 
of pension recipients to contribution payers 
(for more details, see p. 56). In recent years, 
however, this has, in fact, raised pensions, as 
the number of contribution payers has in -
creased more sharply than the number of pen -
sion recipients (see the chart on p. 57 for the 
figures).
All things considered, pension funding since 
2008 has thus taken a significantly more fa -
vourable turn than was expected at the time. 
Positive growth in employment was the key 
factor in this development. Despite the fact 
that benefits have been expanded in the mean -
time, the contribution rate is now 1.4 percent -
age points lower and the replacement rate is 
1 percentage point higher than was projected 
in autumn 2007, for example.12
Demographic change will 
put pressure on pension 
funding
Demographic change has a major impact on 
the statutory pension insurance scheme. Key 
factors are the birth rate, life expectancy and 
migration. Furthermore, developments in la -
bour force participation have an important in -
fluence on the pension insurance scheme.
There has been a sharp fall in the birth rate13 
since the mid-1960s. It has fallen relatively 
swiftly from around 2½ to somewhat below 1½. Most recently, it was somewhat higher 
again at 1.57. In the baseline variant of its cur -
rent population projection exercise, the Federal 
Statistical Office assumes a broadly unchanged 
birth rate of 1.55.14 The sharp decline about 50 
years ago has led to a demographic hump. 
Above all, when the 1960s cohorts with rela -
tively high birth rates (baby boomers) enter re -
tirement from the mid-2020s onwards, they 
will have to be financed by significantly smaller 
cohorts. The additional pressure on the pen -
sion insurance scheme caused by the extremely 
unequal cohort sizes will ease again when the 
baby boom generation dies out.
The cited population projection shows life ex -
pectancy continuing to rise steadily. In 1960, 
remaining life expectancy at the age of 65 was, 
on average, 13½ years (men and women). 
Since then, it has increased to 19½ years. It is 
to be expected that it will have gone up by a 
further 4½ years by 2070. With an unchanged 
statutory retirement age, there will be a steady 
increase in the pension- drawing period.
In recent years, there has been considerable 
net immigration. Over the past ten years, this 
has amounted to an annual average of around 
400,000 persons. Labour- market- oriented im -
migration has played a key part in this. What is 
crucial for the statutory pension insurance 
scheme is the extent to which migration alters 
the number and structure of its contributor 
base and then, at a later date, the number and 
structure of pension recipients. Three things are 
of central importance: the age of those immi -Developments

11 The statutory retirement age of 67 will apply for the first 
time for those born in 1964. This cohort will therefore 
enter regular retirement at the age of 67 in 2031, instead 
of at the age of 65 in 2029 as would be the case under the 
old legislation. There are various exceptions with regard to 
the retirement age, one particular example being retire -
ment on a full pension at the age of 63 as cited above.
12 See Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (2007).
13 The birth rate for each year reflects the extrapolated 
number of live births per female in the age range of 15 to 
49 years. This is the total fertility rate of a given calendar 
year; for more details, see Federal Statistical Office (2012, 
2019a).
14 Taken in isolation, this would lead to a decline in the 
population. For more information, see Federal Statistical 
Office (2019b). The projections range up to 2060.Deutsche Bundesbank

grating and emigrating, integration into the la -
bour market, and the impact on future demo -
graphic developments.15 In the cited popula -
tion projection, net migration falls to around 
200,000 persons per year by 2026 (corres -
ponds largely to the long- term median). After 
this, it remains constant. Migration is thus 
counteracting the effect of the low birth rate.
All three demographic factors affect the old-  
age dependency ratio. This is the ratio of older 
persons to people of working age. The working 
age is often defined as the age range from 20 
to less than 65 years. As the retirement age is 
being raised progressively, however, it is de -fined in the following sections as the range be -
tween 20 and the statutory retirement age. In 
1990, for example, the old- age dependency 
ratio defined in this way was 24%. In other 
words, for every person of retirement age and 
above, there were roughly four persons of 
working age. With the retirement of the baby 
boomer generation, the old- age dependency 
ratio could rise to 45% by 2035. This ratio

15 Pension entitlements might exist in the case of emigra -
tion. Future pressure on the statutory pension insurance 
scheme will then not be eased, even if there are fewer resi -
dents of retirement age. Conversely, this is the case, say, for 
older immigrants without pension entitlements. The sus -
tainability factor covers all of the pensions paid (including 
to pension recipients who have emigrated).Deutsche Bundesbank

would then initially remain largely stable. Al -
though life expectancy will continue to rise, the 
baby boomer cohorts will gradually die out. If 
the statutory retirement age were to remain 
unchanged at 67 years, as under the current 
legal situation, the expected rise in life expect -
ancy would then make itself felt again, how -
ever. The outcome would be a persistent in -
crease in the old- age dependency ratio. In 
2070, it would be around 53%. For every per -
son of retirement age and above, there would 
then be fewer than two persons of working 
age (see chart on p. 61).
In addition to these demographic factors, 
changes in labour force participation play an 
important role for pension funding. Rising la -
bour force participation temporarily counter -
acts demographic pressure – until the corres -
ponding pension entitlements filter through. In 
Germany, labour force participation is experien -
cing a stable upward trend. The ratio of paid 
employees to the population aged between 20 
and the statutory retirement age has risen from 
66% in 1995 to currently just over 80%. For 
the most part, the projections are based on the 
assumption that this ratio will increase some -
what more.16
All in all, these developments nonetheless exert 
considerable pressure on pension funding. As 
things currently stand, adjustments to the key 
pension insurance variables relative to the 
present values will be necessary: if not, expend -
iture will significantly outpace receipts in the 
long term. The key pension insurance scheme 
variables are the contribution rate, the replace -
ment rate, the statutory retirement age (and 
thus the average standardised pension- drawing 
period) and the government funds provided.
Pension policy action plan 
to 2025
In important ways, the reforms of the 2000s 
set the course for managing demographic 
change in the statutory pension insurance scheme. The reforms were designed to spread 
the burden across all variables. First, pension 
adjustments and consequently the replacement 
rate are to be curtailed (as an accompanying 
measure, voluntary private pension provision is 
being promoted). Second, the reforms include 
higher contribution rates going forward. Third, 
government funds are to rise significantly (out -
pacing the tax base). Fourth, by the beginning 
of the 2030s, the statutory retirement age will 
have been raised to 67 years.
Since the pension package of 2014, benefits 
have been selectively expanded again. In order 
to finance these benefits, a higher contribution 
rate and additional government funds will be 
needed, all other things being equal; at the 
same time, the replacement rate will be lower 
overall. The most recent pension package of 
2019 altered the underlying mechanisms for 
adjusting the contribution rate and the replace -
ment rate until the end of 2025: the contribu -
tion rate will be subject to a maximum thresh -
old of 20% and the replacement rate will have 
a minimum threshold of 48% (double thresh -
olds). Funding gaps are, therefore, inevitable 
from today’s perspective. These will have to be 
closed through higher government funds. A 
fundamental reform has been announced for 
the subsequent period. Without further adjust -
ments, the previously applicable legislation 
would apply again from 2026 onwards, with 
the burdens shared as described above.
Longer- term outlook – 
 current legal situation
Projections can help to assess the impact of 
demographic change on the pension insurance 
scheme. The German government’s annual 
pension insurance report looks at the next 14 
years, with its most recent report of November 
2018 including projections up to 2032.17 How -At times, rising

The OLG model and key assumptions of the simulations
Essential features of the OLG model
The simulation results are based on a gen-
eral equilibrium model with overlapping 
generations (OLG) developed by the Bun-
desbank.1 It contains profi  t- maximising 
fi  rms, rational utility- maximising households 
and the government. A model framework 
of this nature captures both micro and 
macroeconomic correlations, meaning that 
households, for example, react to changes 
in the statutory pension insurance scheme, 
such as the retirement age or the replace-
ment rate. Changes in households’ behav-
iour, in turn, impact on macroeconomic de-
velopments and public fi  nances. The statu-
tory pension insurance scheme is thus inte-
grated into a macroeconomic model. This is 
where the present analysis differs from pre-
vious analyses conducted by the Bundes-
bank.2 However, the simulations still focus 
on the pension insurance scheme’s budget-
ary relationships against the backdrop of 
demographic change, and this explains why 
certain aspects of the macroeconomic 
modelling have been simplifi  ed.
As the model focuses on Germany, the re-
spective parameters are tailored to the situ-
ation there. The development of the return 
on capital in Germany is likely to hinge pri-
marily on developments in the international 
capital market. However, this market has 
not been modelled in the present single 
country model. In the baseline simulation, it 
is thus domestic households’ propensity to 
save, which increases as the population 
ages, that drives the return on capital. This 
appears to be justifi  ed as international 
demographic developments are compar-
able. Thus, if the model were to include an 
international capital market, developments 
would likely be similar. In this case, demo-graphic change in itself would also lead to a 
lower return on capital. However, it seems 
plausible that German pension reforms 
have only a limited impact on the inter-
national return on capital. In this respect, 
the yield curve in those simulations that de-
viate from the baseline simulation has been 
left unchanged.
The generations in the model
Several generations live in parallel in the 
model economy. Each year sees the entry of 
a new generation (more specifi  cally: a co-
hort of 20 year olds). The generations can 
be of varying size. A single generation per 
se is homogeneous and consists of identical 
households. This is a major simplifi  cation 
and means that it is not possible to analyse 
questions regarding income distribution 
within the generations (e.g. the risk of pov-
erty in old age), in particular. At any one 
time, the various generations are at differ-
ent stages of life: households go through a 
life cycle in which they fi  rst work and then 
retire. At the end of each period, there is a 
given probability that the individual house-
holds will die. The older a household, the 
greater this probability. Cohorts born later 
have a higher life expectancy.
Demographics and labour force 
 participation
The focus of this OLG model designed by 
the Bundesbank lies on the demographic 
challenges for Germany from today’s per-
1 The model is based on the methodological approach 
of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987). Essentially it is the 
same model as used in Börsch- Supan and Ludwig 
(2009) and Vogel et al. (2017). It will be outlined in 
depth in an upcoming Bundesbank discussion paper.

spective. To do this, it models the popula-
tion growth projected for Germany in de-
tail.
The key demographic variables are birth 
rate, life expectancy and migration. Up to 
2060, the population growth modelled is 
based on the medium variant from the 
most recent projections by the Federal Stat-
istical Offi   ce.3 After 2060, birth rate and mi-
gration are assumed to be constant. Life 
expectancy initially grows until 2100 in line 
with the average for the previous years and 
then remains stable.4
In addition to the number of people of 
working age, a further factor is important 
here, namely labour force participation. In 
the model, labour force participation is de-
fi  ned as the ratio of the number of depend-
ent employees to the number of persons 
aged between 20 years and the statutory 
retirement age.5 The labour force participa-
tion of the individual cohorts follows a 
hump- shaped curve over the life cycle. Over 
recent years, labour force participation has 
been increasing, especially for women and 
older people. For modelling purposes, it is 
assumed that this trend will continue. A ris-
ing statutory retirement age thus means 
longer working lives. In the model, labour 
force participation in the baseline simula-
tion under the assumptions made increases 
from 80¼% in 2018 to 81½% in 2035. It 
reaches 82¼% by 2050 and then remains constant. Overall, the assumptions regard-
ing labour force participation are particu-
larly uncertain.
The government in the model
The government imposes proportional taxes 
on labour income, pensions, capital income 
and private consumption. The govern-
ment’s budget is assumed to be balanced 
each year. This is achieved by endogenously 
adjusting the tax rate on consumption. By 
modelling the government – albeit in a sim-
plistic form – the picture is more compre-
hensive than in models which focus solely 
on the statutory pension insurance scheme.
The model covers the statutory pension in-
surance scheme in relative detail. The 
scheme’s receipts comprise social security 
contributions and government funds. These 
receipts fi  nance the scheme’s annual ex-
penditure. In the baseline simulation, the 
contribution rate is set in such a way that 
the scheme’s annual budget is balanced. 
For the most part, government funds are 
determined based on the contribution rate 
and per capita earnings. The government is 
thus treated as a contribution payer. A 
smaller part is determined based on the de-
velopment of social security contributions.6
3 See Federal Statistical Offi   ce (2019b). In each case, 
the assumptions from the second variant (G2- L2- W2) 
were chosen. In this variant, birth rate, life expectancy 
and migration balance were in the middle of the range 
for the other variants.
4 The projections also contain information on the age 
profi  le of the immigrants and emigrants. However, the 
model does not distinguish between new immigrants 
and persons already living in Germany.
5 It is assumed that the share of self- employed persons 
in the labour force (9½%) and the share of employees 
subject to social security contributions as paid employ-
ees (81%) remain constant.
6 As a result, if contribution rates rise, the volume of 
government funds is somewhat overestimated as a 
portion of federal government grants is not tied to the 
contribution rate. In the model, government funds 
have a somewhat broader defi  nition and also contain 
contribution payments from other social security 
schemes that have not been explicitly modelled here.Key demographic variables

The individual pension amount is derived 
from the earnings points acquired during 
employment and the pension value. This is 
based largely on the pension adjustment 
formula according to the current legal situ-
ation or the respective form that it takes in 
the divergent simulations.
Besides government funds for the statutory 
pension insurance scheme, modelling for 
the government also includes spending on 
government consumption. The latter is kept 
stable over time in relation to total value 
added. By contrast, in all simulations, gov-
ernment funds rise at a faster pace than 
value added and, therefore, the modelled 
tax base. This ultimately pushes up the con-
sumption tax rate.
The statutory pension insurance 
scheme’s expenditure
The statutory pension insurance scheme’s 
expenditure included in the model com-
prises spending on old- age pensions as well 
as additional expenditure by the scheme: 
pensions for persons with reduced earnings 
capacity and for surviving dependents, con-
tributions to the statutory health insurance 
scheme and expenditure for rehabilitation 
and administration. With the exception of 
surviving dependents’ pensions, it is as-
sumed that expenditure develops in line 
with spending on ordinary old- age pen-
sions. In the past, surviving dependents’ 
pensions have shown a clear downward 
trend. This is most likely due, not least, to 
the increase in labour force participation of 
women in particular (at the same time as 
tighter provisions for deductions). This trend 
is extrapolated up to 2070. On balance, the 
share of surviving dependents’ pensions 
falls by roughly half (from the current level) 
by then.Quantitative results are clear but 
defi  nite  fi  gures should be interpreted 
with caution
The article shows quantitative results for 
the respective simulations. While it is pos-
sible to model trends and demonstrate key 
correlations, these projections do not claim 
to give an accurate prediction of the future. 
Given the high level of uncertainty, this is 
not realistic – neither here, nor in any other 
type of model. A number of aspects can 
only be stylised and economic relationships 
are shown in a simplifi  ed form. This is ne-
cessary in order for the model to be man-
ageable. In addition, numerous assump-
tions have to be made for very long periods 
of time. As a result, caution should be exer-
cised when interpreting the defi  nite fi  gures 
reported.Deutsche Bundesbank

ever, this is not long enough to model the al -
ready foreseeable consequences of demo -
graphic change. Significant changes – for in -
stance in connection with the baby boomers – 
will not be felt until later. The European 
Commission, in its most recent Ageing Report, 
makes projections up until 2070, for example.18 
Although uncertainty rises considerably for 
longer time horizons, the underlying correl -
ations and challenges for the statutory pension 
insurance scheme can nonetheless be cap -
tured. For instance, the expected developments 
and effects of possible reforms can be pro -
jected from the current standpoint. Longer-  
term projections therefore provide important 
information for reform decisions. Overall, they 
illustrate the outlook for and the risks involved 
with public old-age provision for both policy 
makers and pension insurance scheme mem -
bers.
The following section will present the long-  
term outlook until 2070 on the basis of an 
overlapping generations (OLG) model de -
veloped by the Bundesbank. This model uses 
the Federal Statistical Office’s population pro -
jection in its medium scenario (for more on the 
assumptions and the OLG model, see the box 
on pp. 63 ff.). The following section will start by 
presenting a simulation based on the current 
legal situation. After that, further simulations 
will be used to illustrate the importance of key 
pension variables. The results of such long- term 
calculations using a stylised model should be 
interpreted with caution and should not be 
seen as precise point forecasts. Rather, they 
illustrate  key correlations and the relative mag -
nitude of the effects of individual measures.
The results of the baseline simulation, which is 
based on the current legal situation, are within 
the spectrum of findings for other simula -
tions.19 Deviations result, inter alia, from differ -
ences in the model class, the assumptions 
made, the starting year (and thus the data used 
for comparisons) as well as the underlying legal 
provisions.Contribution rate
The contribution rate must be raised if the sus -
tainability reserve would otherwise fall below 
its minimum permissible size. Up until 2025, 
however, the contribution rate is capped at 
20%. In the light of the demographic situation, 
the reserves are likely to dwindle from their cur -
rently high level to their minimum over the next 
few years, and the contribution rate will prob -
ably have to be raised from its present level of 
18.6%. As things currently stand, the contribu -
tion rate looks set to reach the maximum 
threshold in 2025. Based on the simulation 
using the current legal situation, the contribu -
tion rate will subsequently rise particularly 
sharply (to a magnitude of 24%) up until the 
end of the 2030s as the baby boomers enter 
retirement. Up until 2070, growth will remain 
substantial, albeit slower (to 26%).
Replacement rate after 
45 years of contributions
For the replacement rate (see the explanations 
on pp. 55f.), the minimum threshold of 48% 
will apply until 2025. After that, the sustainabil -
ity factor will apply again under applicable law. 
This is the main reason why the replacement 
rate will fall continuously after that.20 At the 
end of the 2030s, the simulations suggest that 
the replacement rate will be just under 43%, 
while the figure for 2070 is 40%. The decline 
will potentially be compensated by voluntary 
private pension schemes, which is the aim of Long- term fore -
cast using OLG

20 All other things being equal, an increasing contribution 
rate for the public long- term care insurance scheme and/ or 
a declining contribution rate for the unemployment insur -
ance scheme reinforce the drop in the replacement rate. 
Changes to these rates are disregarded in the following as 
their size is difficult to assess. If, say, the contribution rate 
for the public long- term care insurance scheme rises by 
1 percentage point, the replacement rate will be roughly 
¼ point lower than calculated here.Deutsche Bundesbank

measures to promote such private old-age pro -
vision.21
In general, it should be noted that although 
the recognised replacement rate will drop for a 
constant 45 years of contributions, the number 
of years that contributions are paid will in -
crease as the statutory retirement age rises to 
67. We will return to this aspect later in this 
article. In addition, when looking at pension in -
surance scheme coverage it must be taken into 
consideration that the percentage of pension 
recipients within a given cohort will rise notice -
ably over time. This is because labour force par -
ticipation in employment subject to social se -
curity contributions has grown significantly 
over time.
Retirement age
The rise in the statutory retirement age to 67 
will prevent increasing life expectancy from 
raising the relative pension- drawing period up 
until 2031. The relative pension- drawing period 
is defined as the ratio of years drawing a pen -
sion to years making pension contributions, as -
suming retirement at the standard age.22 Going 
forward (from the 2030s onwards), a constant 
number of years of contributions will have to 
finance an increasing number of years in retire -
ment again if the statutory retirement age re -
mains unchanged from then on. This will in -
creasingly weigh on the pension insurance 
scheme. In the past, the relative pension-  
drawing period has risen sharply as a result of 
increasing remaining life expectancy among 
the post- retirement generation: it went up 
from 30% in 1960 to 42% in 2011. Without a 
further increase in the statutory retirement age, 
it would be 47% in 2070 (see the chart on 
p. 70).
Government funds
The funds that the German government pro -
vides for the pension insurance scheme will rise sharply in the longer term. In large part, they 
will go up in line with per capita wages and the 
contribution rate. As a consequence, govern -More wide -

need to be taken into account. Given the persistent low 
interest rate environment, their potential returns are the 
subject of much critical debate. However, this is not the 
main focus of this article. For information on the overall 
replacement rate with different rates of return based on 
the “Riester” pension plan, see, for example, Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2016).
22 For the purposes of this article, employment is defined 
as starting at 20 years of age and ending with retirement at 
the statutory retirement age. The assumption made in the 
OLG model is that, as the statutory retirement age in -
creases, so too will the actual retirement age – as has been 
the case so far (see also the box on pp. 63 ff.).Deutsche Bundesbank

ment funds overall are likely to significantly 
outpace the overall assessment basis for re -
ceipts from contributions and taxes. In the fol -
lowing, gross value added (or value added for 
short) will be used as an aggregate indicator 
for the tax base. In the model, it captures 
macroeconomic developments.23 The increase 
in government funds relative to value added is 
the result, first, of the sharply higher contribu -
tion rate and, second, of the decreasing em -
ployment headcount. As a result, the total 
wage bill and value added are growing more 
slowly than per capita wages, to which the ma -
jority of government funds are linked.The fact that government funding is rising 
much faster than the tax base will put the fed -
eral budget under considerable and permanent 
pressure.24 This can generally be offset by lower 
expenditure or higher receipts. In addition, the 
overall burden may be increased or reduced in 
other areas without any further action being 
taken. The interest burden depends on devel -
opments in the debt ratio and interest rates.25 
All of these aspects are disregarded in the fol -
lowing, with the analysis focusing solely on the 
changes in the burden as a result of the funds 
that the government has to provide for the 
statutory pension insurance scheme. This is 
captured by the rise in government funds rela -
tive to value added. In order to further illustrate 
its magnitude, we also state how many points 
of the standard rate of turnover tax this would 
equate to in today’s terms.
The model simulations show that, under the 
current legal situation, the need for govern -
ment funds would expand substantially com -
pared with 2018, with requirements rising to 
around 1¾% of value added a year by 2070. 
This equates to 4½ percentage points of the 
standard rate of turnover tax.

23 Gross domestic product (GDP), which is often used as 
the macroeconomic reference variable, is not modelled. 
Gross value added currently accounts for about 90% of 
GDP . It is closer to the national income and consequently 
probably reflects the assessment basis for taxes relatively 
well.
24 The specific modelling of the government funds means 
that the burden for the government is slightly overesti -
mated while the burden for contribution payers and pen -
sion recipients is somewhat underestimated in the simula -
tions.
25 For instance, expenditure on pensions for retired post 
office and railway civil servants as well as on miners’ pen -
sions will come down over time. However, many additional 
demands are also currently being made on the federal 
budget, for example in connection with defence and the

maximum thresholds expire. The legal situation 
on which the baseline simulation outlined 
above is based is therefore likely to change. A 
key issue in all of this is the future distribution 
of the adjustment burdens. In order to cover a 
broad spectrum, various further simulations are 
shown below. As compared with the baseline 
simulation, the first simulations distribute the 
adjustment burdens relatively one- sidedly, with 
either the replacement rate or contributions 
bearing the brunt. After that, examples of 
broader- based burden sharing are presented.
Relatively one- sided burden 
sharing
The first simulation freezes the replacement 
rate (in the current definition) after 45 years of 
contributions at 48%: in other words, the cur -
rent minimum threshold is extended beyond 
2025. The statutory retirement age remains un -
changed at 67 years from the 2030s onwards, 
as in the baseline simulation. As a result, the 
contribution rate rises very sharply, as pension 
expenditure now increases much more strongly 
than under the current legal situation. The con -
tribution rate is significantly higher in 2070 (in 
the region of 31%) than in the baseline simula -
tion. In addition, government funds also grow 
more sharply as they are linked to the contribu -
tion rate. By 2070, the ratio of government 
funds relative to value added would expand by 
2½ percentage points. From today’s perspec -
tive, this would correspond to the revenue 
from around 7 percentage points of the stand -
ard rate of turnover tax. The federal budget 
would therefore come under significant pres -
sure.
In a second simulation, the contribution rate 
rather than the replacement rate is fixed at the 
level it reaches in 2025, namely 20%. This also 
considerably dampens the increase in most of 
the associated government funds. The replace -
ment rate now bears the brunt of demographic 
change. Up until the end of the 2030s, it drops 
into the region of 35% and by 2070 to around 30%. The coverage provided by the statutory 
pension insurance scheme thus shrinks consid -
erably.
In a third simulation, the thresholds for both 
the replacement rate and the contribution rate 
remain in place after 2025. The full adjustment 
burden therefore lies on the federal budget, 
and the government funds employed shoot up -
ward. In 2070, they are, relative to value added, 
almost 7¾  percentage points higher than in 
2018 (in the region of 20 percentage points of 
the standard rate of turnover tax). The percent -
age of the statutory pension insurance scheme’s 
receipts funded by the Federal Government 
rises to well over 50% (currently: 29%).
Broader- based burden sharing
The simulations described above concentrate 
the burden of demographic adjustment on in -
dividual variables in a rather one- sided fashion. 
They thereby illustrate key correlations, and the 
strongly conclusive results ultimately show why 
broader- based burden sharing is the obvious 
choice. We will present further relevant ex -
ample simulations below.
Indexation of statutory retirement age to 
life expectancy to stabilise the ratio of the 
period of pension payment to the period of 
employment
One starting point is the statutory retirement 
age. Under the current legal situation, it will in -
crease until the early 2030s, before remaining 
unchanged at 67 years thereafter. However, life 
expectancy is likely to continue to rise even 
after that. To take this into account, several 
countries index the statutory retirement age to 
life expectancy.26 The OECD, the IMF and the 
European Commission recommend this proced -Simulations

ure for Germany, too.27 As the statutory retire -
ment age rises, the actual age at which people 
enter retirement is also likely to increase – as 
has been the case to date.28 This expands the 
workforce and is therefore also beneficial for 
overall economic growth and incomes. Receipts 
from pension contributions as well as from the 
other social security contributions and taxes 
would then likewise develop more favourably.
The number of pensions in payment grows 
more slowly if the statutory retirement age is 
raised, which, in turn, supports the replacement 
rate via the sustainability factor (see the explan -
ations on p. 56). In addition, members of the 
statutory pension insurance scheme gain more 
pension entitlements as they pay contributions 
for longer. The individual replacement rate con -
sequently rises. As the statutory retirement age 
goes up, it would therefore make sense to 
stipulate a higher number of years of contribu -
tions in the definition of the standard pension 
and thus in the replacement rate. If, say, the retirement age is set at 67, the standard pen -
sion and, consequently, the replacement rate, 
would have to be calculated for 47 instead of 
45 years of contributions (dynamically adjusted 
replacement rate; see the box on p. 71).
In principle, there are various conceivable ap -
proaches to increasing the statutory retirement 
age. A very sweeping approach would be for 
all demographic burdens, i.e. both rising life ex -
pectancy and lower birth rates (fluctuating co -
hort sizes), to be absorbed through increases in 
the retirement age. However, the retirement 
age would have to rise very sharply in this case. 
It would also have to be raised significantly

Dynamic defi  nition of the replacement rate for a rising 
retirement age with longer contribution periods
The replacement rate plays a key role in the 
pension debate and in pension policy. It is 
intended to capture the extent to which a 
pension determined in the standardised 
manner is in proportion to an employment 
income determined in the standardised 
manner, i.e. in principle, the relative level of 
a pension as a replacement for earnings. 
Fundamentally, different defi  nitions are pos-
sible and make sense depending on the ob-
jective.
The replacement rate offered by a standard 
pension is at the centre of the current pen-
sion debate (for instance, in the Federal 
Government’s pension insurance report). It 
is also the basis for the statutory threshold 
of 48%, which will apply to the end of 
2025. However, the rising statutory retire-
ment age is not taken into account. In-
stead, a constant fi  gure of 45 years of pen-
sion contributions is assumed. When it 
comes to illustrating the development of 
potential pension entitlements over time, 
however, it would make sense to have a 
new defi  nition that includes the higher 
statutory retirement age.
Currently, the replacement rate is still meas-
ured at 45 earnings points for a standard 
pension. This standard pension is intended 
to refl  ect a stylised history of employment 
for persons covered by the statutory pen-
sion insurance scheme who have worked 
for average earnings between the ages of 
20 and 65 (in a nutshell: the replacement 
rate after 45 years of contributions). How-
ever, the statutory retirement age is being 
raised incrementally to 67. The intended 
longer period of employment is hence not 
taken into account.In the past, the individual retirement age 
was based largely on the statutory retire-
ment age. If this increases, the average em-
ployment periods of all persons covered by 
the statutory pension insurance scheme 
would most likely be extended. It therefore 
seems obvious to extend the periods of em-
ployment included in the standard pension 
in parallel with the rise in the statutory re-
tirement age. Moreover, an adjustment in 
the contribution periods on which the 
standard pension is based is not a new con-
cept. Until the end of the 1980s, the stand-
ard pension was calculated at 40 years of 
contributions. During a transitional period 
from 1988 to 1990, the Federal Govern-
ment provided two standard pensions in 
parallel. Following this, the standard pen-
sion refl  ected only the new level.
Against this backdrop, a dynamically ad-
justed replacement rate is provided in the 
simulations in this section. The underlying 
standard pension takes into account the 
additional earnings points acquired by later 
cohorts in a longer working period (see 
footnote 33 on p. 73 regarding the adjust-
ment of pensions in payment).
For instance, the following picture thus 
emerges for the baseline simulation accord-
ing to the current legal situation presented 
above: people will reach the statutory re-
tirement age of 67 for the fi  rst time in 2031. 
At this point in time, the dynamically ad-
justed replacement rate with 47 years of 
contributions would be about 1 percentage 
point higher than the traditionally calcu-
lated replacement rate after 45 years of 
contributions.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2019

when the baby boomer cohorts enter retire -
ment between the mid-2020s and the 
mid-2030s. In the following example simula -
tions, by contrast, the adjustment burdens are 
spread more broadly. The statutory retirement 
age rises as planned until the beginning of the 
2030s, followed by additional rule- based in -
creases. In addition, the replacement rate is dy -
namically adjusted, with the contribution 
period for the standard pension increasing in 
parallel with the statutory retirement age. 
Compared to the replacement rate based on a 
static contribution period of just 45 years, the 
dynamically adjusted replacement rate is 
higher.In concrete terms, the statutory retirement age 
is adjusted so that the ratio of years in retire -
ment to years of contributions – i.e. the relative 
pension- drawing period – remains broadly 
stable as of the 2030s. Essentially, therefore, 
the current approach continues until the begin -
ning of the 2030s, and even within this time -
frame the increasing statutory retirement age 
largely stabilises the relative pension- drawing 
period (see the chart on p.  70). The relative 
pension- drawing period therefore stands at 
around 40% on a lasting basis. In other words, 
given the life expectancy projections used here, 
the statutory retirement age would have to 
rise, on average, by three quarters of a month 
per year.29 For example, a person entering re -
tirement at the age of 67 in 2031 has a life 
expectancy of 86 years. In 2070, the statutory 
retirement age would be 69⅓ and life expect -
ancy 89½ years. The period of pension pay -
ment would then be just over 20 years and 
thus more than one year longer than in 2031 
(on the topic of health in old age, see also the 
box on p. 74). In practice, an indexation would 
take into account the uncertainty connected 
with future life expectancy. If life expectancy 
projections were to change, there would be 
corresponding rule- based adjustments to the 
statutory retirement age as well. For example, 
the statutory retirement age would remain 
constant if life expectancy no longer in -
creased.30Ratio of

29 In principle, if life expectancy increases, 70% of the 
additional years flow into a longer employment period and 
30% extend the pension- drawing period. For the purpose 
of the calculations, however, the retirement age is adjusted 
in full- month increments. It therefore increases by one 
month per year for three years and then remains un -
changed in the fourth year. The ratio of 70 to 30 thus holds 
more or less for the entire period of life from the age of 20 
onwards.
30 Retiring earlier or later could remain possible, but the 
statutory retirement age would serve as the reference point 
for deductions or add- ons. These would have to be largely 
fair from an actuarial perspective. Currently, deductions are 
made for early retirement (3.6% per year) and add- ons are 
made for postponed retirement (6.0% per year). If the cur -
rent derogations allowing early retirement on a full pension 
should continue, these rules would also need to be ad -
justed to take a rising statutory retirement age into ac -
count. An obvious solution would be to increase the re -
quired contribution periods in line with any rise in the 
statutory retirement age.Deutsche Bundesbank

Simulation with an indexed statutory 
 retirement age and a dynamically adjusted 
replacement rate
The indexation of the statutory retirement age 
described is illustrated in a further simulation. 
The ratio of years in retirement to years of con -
tributions is held largely stable from the 2030s 
onwards. Apart from this, the current legal 
situation continues to apply, i.e. the burden is 
distributed relatively broadly across the other 
variables. They thus absorb the burden arising 
from the decline in the birth rate. As of 2026, 
pensions therefore again need to be adjusted 
in accordance with the pension adjustment for -
mula.31 The dynamically adjusted replacement 
rate falls chiefly due to the strain of baby 
boomers entering retirement (to around 44% 
by the end of the 2030s). It then stabilises. Al -
though baby boomers pass away, cohorts with 
higher labour force participation rates retire. 
The cohort sizes then change only moderately 
and, due to the rising statutory retirement age, 
rising life expectancy no longer exerts any pres -
sure.32 At the same time, the increasing num -
ber of contribution years supports the dynam -
ically calculated replacement rate (see the chart 
on p. 72).33
In this simulation, the contribution rate still in -
creases significantly to around 24% in 2070. 
However, the increase is much smaller than 
would be the case without a further rise in the 
statutory retirement age. Contribution payers 
and the federal budget come under less strain. 
First, the pressure is eased by the smaller num -
ber of people drawing a pension and, second, 
the higher degree of employment leads to a 
marked increase in the tax base. As a percent -
age of value added, government funds rise by 
1¼  percentage points on their 2018 level 
(3½ percentage points of the standard rate of 
turnover tax). Ultimately, the additional bur -
dens from the lower birth rates are thus distrib -
uted, on the one hand, among pension recipi -
ents (via the replacement rate), and, on the 
other hand, among contribution payers and 
taxpayers.Simulation with an indexed statutory 
 retirement age and an additional threshold

sion debate. The preceding simulation shows

31 The additional years of contributions are taken into ac -

32 The cohort sizes fluctuate even after the 2030s, as the 
demographic “hump” of the baby boomers has an impact 
via their children. However, it is assumed that these effects 
increasingly taper off. At the end of the simulations pre -
sented here, in 2070, the dynamically adjusted replace -
ment rate bottoms out at around 43%. As the descendants 
of the baby boomer cohorts die in the 2080s, the replace -
ment rate increases again to 44% and then remains at this 
level in the long term.
33 The pension adjustment formula was expanded for the 
simulation. The expansion ensures that the replacement 
rate over the course of the pension- drawing period corres -
ponds to the replacement rate for new retirees – despite 
new retirees having longer contribution periods (on ac -
count of the rising statutory retirement age). Accordingly, 
pensions in payment are adjusted to a greater extent. The 
principle is similar to the current higher valuation of pen -
sions in eastern Germany. Their alignment with the level in 
western Germany will be completed in 2024.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2019  
73

the long term, it stabilises at 43% to 44%. In 
this context, supplementary private pension 
provision can compensate for the fall in the re -
placement rate. Nonetheless, calls are fre -
quently made for the replacement rate to be 
prevented from falling any further or for at 
least thresholds to be put in place.
For that reason, the following simulations are 
shown with thresholds for the dynamically ad -
justed replacement rate described above. The 
adjustment burden thereby shifts further to the 
receipts side, i.e. to contribution rates and gov -
ernment funds. Risks of more unfavourable de -
velopments would therefore be borne by con -
tribution payers and taxpayers.
The costs of thresholds increase significantly 
after 2025. Once the baby boomers reach re -
tirement age, the trajectory of rising costs flat -
tens. The simulations show, as a rule of thumb, 
that a 1 percentage point higher threshold for 
the dynamically adjusted replacement rate re -
quires the contribution rate in 2070 to be 
around ½  percentage point higher. At the 
same time, government funds as a percentage 
of value added are 0.1 percentage point higher 
(equivalent to ¼ percentage point of the stand -
ard rate of turnover tax).
For example, a contribution rate of 27% is ne -
cessary in 2070 if the dynamically adjusted re -
placement rate is to remain at 48% after 2025. 
The government funds required then also rise 
more sharply by a total of 1¾% of value added 
(4½ percentage points of the standard rate of 
turnover tax). However, the burden on contri -
bution payers and taxpayers is significantly 
lower than if the statutory retirement age re -
mains unchanged and a threshold is applied for 
the non- dynamically adjusted replacement rate 
based on a constant 45-year contribution 
period. If the threshold for the replacement 
rate is set lower at 45%, the contribution rate 
required is correspondingly lower at around 
25%. The increase in government funds needed 
is also then lower, at 1½% of value added Burdens increas -

life expectancy
The aim of raising the statutory retirement 
age is for individuals to have a longer 
working life and retire later. This is under 
the assumption that there are no health 
impediments. Research indicates that 
gains in life expectancy, on the whole, go 
hand in hand with better health at a given 
age.1 Ongoing technological innovation, 
such as the recent advances in digitalisa-
tion, could lead to a decline in hard man-
ual labour or a progressive reduction in 
the physical demands of such work.2 In 
the more detailed simulations outlined in 
this article, longer life expectancy does 
not translate 1:1 into a higher retirement 
age. Instead, part of the increase in life ex-
pectancy lengthens the period of pension 
payment over time.
Nonetheless, some individuals are unable 
to continue in employment, or in full em-
ployment, because of ill health. This can 
be addressed, fi  rst, through professional 
training measures, which might enable 
those affected to take on less demanding 
work, for example. Second, it is both im-
portant and necessary to ensure adequate 
protection for cases of disability. Along-
side any private cover, this is provided pri-
marily by the reduced earnings capacity 
pension, which has recently undergone a 
major benefi  t expansion.3

Social Affairs (2018b) and Robert Koch Institute

bour and Social Affairs (2016b).
3 There are calls for the mismatch in the life ex-
pectancy of different groups to be taken into ac-
count, say, through varying levels of replacement 
rates or different retirement ages. The number of 
years an individual spends in good health, for ex-
ample, is said to be correlated with socio- 
demographic status (see Haan et al. (2019) and 
Unger and Schulze (2013)). However, as the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme does not currently 
distinguish by socio- demographic factors or levy 
risk- based contributions, this would entail a fun-
damental change of system, which will not be dis-
cussed any further here.Deutsche Bundesbank

Conclusions
As a result of demographic trends, the pay- as- 
you- go statutory pension insurance scheme 
will come under considerable pressure in fu -
ture, especially from the mid-2020s onwards. 
The German government has announced a 
pension reform which is intended to come into 
effect as of 2026 and put the pension system 
on a long- term stable footing. The key vari -
ables are the statutory retirement age, the re -
placement rate and the contribution rate. They 
affect the future scope of the statutory pension 
insurance scheme and the distribution of 
demographic burdens across cohorts. A role is 
also played by government funds, which are 
provided by all taxpayers.
The reform debate should take account of the 
effects of policy changes, including over the 
long term. For this purpose, long- term projec -
tions are used, which, despite all of the uncer -
tainty involved, provide an idea of future devel -
opments. This is also the aim of the simulations 
in this article. They cannot predict the future 
precisely, but are intended to illustrate import -
ant trends and correlations.
The simulations show that individual variables 
would have to be adjusted very sharply if they 
alone had to absorb demographic pressure (see 
the chart on p. 68). This was a major reason 
why previous reforms distributed the burdens 
more broadly. After 2025, when the thresholds 
for the contribution rate and the replacement 
rate expire under current legislation, burdens 
would once again be distributed more broadly.
The statutory retirement age is an important 
factor in further reforms. It will increase to 67 
years by 2031. As a result, the ratio of the 
pension- drawing period to the contribution 
period will not increase, despite the fact that 
life expectancy is rising. If the statutory retire -ment age subsequently remained constant, a 
static number of contribution years would once 
again be set against a continually growing 
period of pension payment (see the chart on 
p. 70), which would put pension funding under 
pressure. To address this, the European Com -
mission, the IMF, and the OECD, among others, 
have suggested further increases in the statu -
tory retirement age in line with rising life ex -
pectancy. Other countries have already put 
such a link in place. Health impediments are 
sometimes pointed out in this context. How -
ever, research indicates that gains in life expect -
ancy are generally accompanied by better 
health. Nevertheless, it should be noted that 
– as per the current situation – it will not be 
possible for everyone to remain in employment 
until reaching the statutory retirement age. Ad -
equate protection in the form of a reduced 
earnings capacity pension is therefore import -
ant and necessary. This coverage has recently 
been expanded markedly.
With an indexed statutory retirement age, fur -
ther targeted stabilisation of the relative 
pension- drawing period from the beginning of 
the 2030s onwards would be possible, for ex -
ample. Persons covered by the statutory pen -
sion insurance scheme in future would first 
have to contribute to the scheme for longer, 
but would subsequently also draw a pension 
for longer. They would therefore be no worse 
off in terms of the ratio of the period of pen -
sion payment to the contribution period. Ac -
cording to current life expectancy projections, 
under such an approach the statutory retire -
ment age would rise by an average of three 
quarters of a month per year as of 2032. Those 
born in 2001 would enter regular retirement at 
the age of 69 and four months from May 2070 
onwards. If life expectancy were to develop dif -
ferently, this would also have an impact on the 
statutory retirement age, provided it were in -
dexed. In order to give those who are affected 
by this time to adjust, changes to the statutory 
retirement age could be smoothed and set out 
well in advance.Reform will

This adjustment to the statutory retirement age 
would not only ease the burden on the statu -
tory pension insurance scheme. Through in -
creased employment, it would also strengthen 
macroeconomic potential and thus boost the 
assessment bases for taxes and social security 
contributions. Overall, it makes it easier for an 
employment- friendly policy to address the chal -
lenges posed by demographic change.
Longer periods of employment and more years 
of contributions also lead to greater pension 
entitlements. It would therefore be logical to 
take this into account in the projections of the 
replacement rate and the thresholds applying 
to it. For instance, the number of contribution 
years factored into the calculation of the re -
placement rate could rise in line with the statu -
tory retirement age. For example, such a dy -
namically adjusted replacement rate would re -
quire 46 years of contributions on the basis of 
average earnings in 2024, and 47 years of con -
tributions in 2031 (see the box on p.  71). It 
would not be unprecedented to change the 
number of contribution years in terms of the 
replacement rate. Up to the end of the 1980s, 
the replacement rate was based on 40 years of 
contributions rather than on the current 45 
years.
Indexing the statutory retirement age as de -
scribed would absorb the pressure caused by 
longer life expectancy. However, other factors 
would still need to be addressed, including, in 
particular, the impact of lower birth rates since 
the 1970s. The vast majority of these adjust -
ments would be concluded by the end of the 
2030s. This means that, from this point on -
wards, almost no additional pressure on pen -
sion funding would arise. In the simulations 
presented here, the dynamically adjusted re -
placement rate – with adjustment mechanisms 
otherwise remaining unchanged  – falls from about 48% today to 43% by 2070, before sta -
bilising at 44% thereafter. The contribution rate 
increases from 18.6% to 24%. Over time, gov -
ernment funds also increase significantly rela -
tive to value added. The increase in this ratio by 
2070 corresponds, for instance, to the current 
funding volume of 3½ points of the standard 
rate of turnover tax. The respective develop -
ments are, however, much milder than is the 
case if the statutory retirement age is not in -
dexed (see the chart on p. 72).
For the statutory pension insurance scheme to 
be accepted, it is important that the replace -
ment rate is largely deemed to be adequate. A 
permanent threshold in this regard is therefore 
often seen as important. If such a threshold is 
desired, and the statutory retirement age in -
creases, it would be logical to apply the thresh -
old to the dynamically adjusted replacement 
rate.
Nevertheless, if the threshold is extended, both 
the impact of lower birth rates as well as the 
remaining funding risks would be shifted al -
most entirely to contribution payers and tax -
payers. The burden of taxes and contributions 
would potentially rise sharply. Furthermore, this 
problem cannot be solved by additionally cap -
ping the contribution rate, for although this 
would relieve adjustment pressure on the statu -
tory pension insurance scheme, it would place 
additional burdens on the federal budget and 
thus on taxpayers. The current legal situation 
will already lead to a sharp increase in finan -
cing needs, which is sometimes neglected in 
the debate on pensions policy. It is essential 
that this aspect is taken into account in the 
specific design of the pension reform. At the 
very least, the financial impact of a reform 
should be disclosed on the basis of official pro -
jections over the very long term and as com -
prehensively as possible.Longer working

Annex
Selected legislative reforms 
concerning the funding of the 
statutory pension insurance 
scheme since 2008
Pension Adjustment Act 2008 (Gesetz zur 
Rentenanpassung 2008 , 26 June 2008)
The dampening effect of contributions paid into a 
supplementary state- funded private pension scheme 
(“Riester steps”) in the pension adjustment formula 
was suspended for two years, but was then made 
up for in 2012 and 2013. As a result, pensions rose 
by around an additional 0.6  percentage point in 
both 2008 and 2009.
Third Act Amending the Fourth Book of 
the Social Security Code (Drittes Gesetz 
zur Änderung des Vierten Buches Sozial­
gesetzbuch, 26 June 2008)
A safeguard clause was incorporated into the pen -
sion adjustment formula. From mid-2008 onwards, 
a reduction in the nominal pension payment amount 
was no longer permissible even if nominal per capita 
wages declined. Pension cuts waived were to be 
compensated for with deductions on pension in -
creases over the following years.
Act Securing Employment and Stability 
in Germany (Gesetz zur Sicherung von 
Beschäftigung  und Stabilität in Deutsch ­
land, 2 May 2009)
The general contribution rate for the statutory health 
insurance scheme applicable to pensions was re -
duced to 14.9% as of 1 July 2009.
Act Accompanying the 2011 Budget (Haus ­
haltsbegleitgesetz 2011, 9 December 2010)
From 2011 onwards, recipients of unemployment 
benefit II were exempted from compulsory participa -
tion in the pension insurance scheme. As central 
government no longer pays any contributions, re -
cipients of unemployment benefit II no longer accrue 
any pension entitlements.Statutory Health Insurance Scheme 
 Financing Act (GKV­ Finanzierungsgesetz, 
22 December 2010)
The general contribution rate for the statutory health 
insurance scheme was increased to 15.5% as of 
1 January 2011.
Contribution Rate Act 2013 (Beitragssatz ­
gesetz 2013, 5 December 2012)
The pension contribution rate for the year 2013 was 
lowered to 18.9% by law. In contrast to this Act, the 
usual contribution rate regulation would have re -
quired the approval of the Bundesrat, the Upper 
House of the German parliament.
Act on Amendments in the Area of  Low- 
Paid Part-  Time Employment (Gesetz zu 
Änderungen im Bereich der geringfügigen 
Beschäftigung, 5 December 2012)
The existing exemption from participation in the 
pension insurance scheme for low- paid workers 
with the option to opt in was replaced by compul -
sory participation in the pension insurance scheme 
with the option to opt out.
Act Accompanying the 2013 Budget 
 (Haushaltsbegleitgesetz 2013, 
 20  December 2012)
The central government grant to the statutory pen -
sion insurance scheme was cut by €1 billion in 2013 
and by €1.25 billion each year from 2014 to 2016.
Contribution Rate Act 2014 
 (Beitragssatzgesetz 2014, 25 March 2014)
In anticipation of the additional funding required as 
a result of the planned Act on Improvements in Pen -
sion Insurance Scheme Benefits, a reduction in the 
pension contribution rate was prevented contrary to 
the normal rules. It remained at 18.9%.
Act on Improvements in Pension Insurance 
Scheme Benefits (RV­ Leistungsverbesse ­
rungsgesetz,  23 June 2014)
As from mid-2014 onwards, persons with an excep -
tionally long contribution history were entitled to re -Deutsche Bundesbank

tire on a full pension at the age of 63. This retire -
ment age will be increased incrementally to 65 up to 
2029 in line with the gradual increase in the statu -
tory retirement age to 67.
The crediting of child- raising periods for children 
born prior to 1992 in pension entitlements (“mothers’ 
pensions”) was doubled from one year to two years. 
In future, two earnings points in each case will thus 
be credited, leading to an increase in pension en -
titlements.
The non- contributory supplementary period for per -
sons with reduced earnings capacity was raised from 
60 to 62 years; in future, upon retirement, it will 
therefore be assumed that persons with reduced 
earnings capacity would have been in receipt of 
earnings up to the age of 62.
Act Improving the Financial Structure and 
Quality of the Statutory Health Insurance 
Scheme (GKV­ Finanzstruktur ­ und  
Qualitäts­ Weiterentwicklungsgesetz, 
21 July 2014)
The general contribution rate for the statutory health 
insurance scheme was reduced from 15.5% to 
14.6% on 1 January 2015. A supplementary contri -
bution introduced to compensate for this – at a rate 
set by each individual health insurer – is to be paid 
solely by the insured persons.
Act on Making the Transition from Work to 
Retirement More Flexible and Strengthening  
Prevention and Rehabilitation in Employ -
ment (Gesetz zur Flexibilisierung des  
Übergangs vom Erwerbsleben in den  
Ruhestand und zur Stärkung von Präven ­
tion und Rehabilitation im Erwerbsleben, 
8 December 2016)
In particular, the regulations for receiving part-  
pensions were made more flexible and it now be -
came possible for employees to acquire full add -
itional pension entitlements, including through gain -
ful employment after reaching the statutory retire -
ment age, by paying a supplementary employee’s 
contribution.Final Pension Transfer Act (Rentenüber­
leitungs­ Abschlussgesetz, 17 July 2017)
The current pension value in eastern Germany is to 
be aligned to the current pension value in western 
Germany in seven steps by law, irrespective of actual 
wage developments in eastern Germany.
Act on Improvements in Benefits for 
 Reduced Earnings Capacity (EM­ Leistungs ­
verbesserungsgesetz, 17 July 2017)
The non- contributory supplementary period for per -
sons with reduced earnings capacity is to be in -
creased incrementally for new retirees from 62 to 65 
years by 2024.
Act on Benefit Improvements and the 
 Stabilisation of the Statutory Pension Insur -
ance Scheme (RV­ Leistungsverbesserungs­ 
und ­ Stabilisierungsgesetz, 28 November 
2018)
The pre- tax net replacement rate may not fall below 
48% and the contribution rate may not exceed 20% 
up to the end of 2025. Any funding gaps are to be 
bridged with additional government funds. The con -
tribution rate may not fall below 18.6% between 
2019 and 2025.
“Mothers’ pensions” were expanded – in future, 2.5 
earnings points will be credited for child- raising 
periods for children born prior to 1992, leading to 
an increase in pension entitlements.
The sliding scale within which low earners pay lower 
social security contributions even above the “mini-  
job” threshold of €450 per month was raised from 
€850 to €1,300 as of mid-2019. Furthermore, the 
reduced pension contributions within this sliding 
scale no longer result in reduced pension entitle -
ments.
The non- contributory supplementary period for per -
sons with reduced earnings capacity was raised to 
65 years and 8 months in a single step as of 2019. 
This will be increased further to 67 years for new 
retirees by 2031. Deductions resulting from early re -
tirement will therefore no longer be applicable for 
persons with reduced earnings capacity.Deutsche Bundesbank

Structural reforms in the euro area
In the last two decades, trend growth in the euro area has decelerated noticeably. The global 
financial and economic crisis as well as the euro area sovereign debt crisis have certainly played 
a key role in this. However, there also appears to have been a slowdown in productivity growth 
in recent decades. Against this backdrop, structural reforms aimed at improving the institutional 
and regulatory framework for macroeconomic processes represent a key element of economic 
policy for promoting prosperity in a sustainable way.
Monetary policy, too, has an interest in reducing structural impediments. Flexible labour and 
product markets can facilitate the transmission of monetary policy measures by making it easier 
to steer the inflation rate towards the monetary policy target. An additional factor specific to the 
euro area is that monetary policy is set for the currency area as a whole. A reduction in national 
and regional structural asymmetries on factor and product markets can increase the effectiveness 
of monetary policy instruments within the single currency area. A reform- induced rise in potential 
growth will also lead to an increase in the equilibrium real interest rate.
The need for reform in the euro area is evident from macroeconomic metrics as well as structural 
indicators. For example, over the past 15 years, the euro area unemployment rate has been 
higher, and the employment rate lower, than in other advanced economies. The labour markets 
have also been characterised by a high, albeit declining, degree of regulation. Although product 
market regulation has been reduced considerably over time, international comparisons reveal 
that there is still scope for deregulation in individual countries and sectors. Institutional quality in 
some euro area Member States has also remained significantly below the highest ratings amongst 
OECD countries.
Although there is scope for reform as well as an expected positive long- term macroeconomic 
impact of structural measures, the momentum for reform in the euro area has slowed down in 
recent years. For some countries, the pressure to reform imposed by assistance programmes was 
removed. Irrespective of the good macroeconomic conditions, other Member States have evinced 
only limited willingness to implement reforms even though there is sufficient evidence that the 
transition costs of reform can be considerably lower in favourable environments. The argument 
that structural reforms are disadvantageous in the case of a binding lower bound on nominal 
interest rates due to a price- dampening effect is not convincing. Furthermore, any initial costs will 
generally be offset by the reform’s strong, positive impact over the longer term.
Transition costs as well as undesirable distributional effects can be restricted by appropriately 
packaging different reforms. The sequence of reform measures can also encourage societal 
acceptance and improve political viability. However, the effectiveness of structural reforms will 
hinge not least on the credible commitment of political decision- makers to a path of reform.Deutsche Bundesbank

Motivation
In the last two decades, trend growth in the 
euro area has decelerated markedly. The global 
financial and economic crisis as well as the 
euro area sovereign debt crisis have undoubt -
edly played a key role in this. However, prod -
uctivity growth also seems to have slowed 
down perceptibly. Against this backdrop, the 
question arises as to which measures – beyond 
monetary and fiscal policy – public institutions 
could use to sustainably foster macroeconomic 
prosperity and economic progress. In this con -
text, structural reforms represent a key element 
of the options available to government. Struc -
tural reforms are generally defined as policy 
measures aimed at improving the institutional 
and regulatory framework for macroeconomic 
processes, thereby contributing to sustainable 
growth in employment, investment and prod -
uctivity.
Structural reforms are often geared towards la -
bour and product markets. For example, these 
reforms can focus on the nature of employ -
ment protection, the amount and duration of 
unemployment benefits, the design of active 
labour market policy, the removal of barriers to 
companies entering or exiting the market, or 
the reduction of red tape. However, structural 
reforms can also be extended to the public sec -
tor and the financial market. High-  quality and 
high- performance judicial, administrative and 
educational systems play an essential role in 
creating a growth- friendly environment. The 
same is true for effective regulation and super -
vision of financial markets.
Monetary policy, too, has an interest in redu -
cing structural impediments. Flexible labour 
and product markets can facilitate the trans -
mission of monetary policy measures by mak -
ing it easier to steer the inflation rate towards 
the monetary policy target.1 An additional fac -
tor specific to the euro area is that monetary 
policy is set for the currency area as a whole. A 
reduction in national and regional structural 
asymmetries on factor and product markets can increase business cycle convergence across 
Member States and thereby the effectiveness 
of the monetary policy toolkit in the single cur -
rency area. Furthermore, flexible labour and 
product markets can strengthen the entire 
monetary union’s resilience to shocks, thus fa -
cilitating the implementation of stability-  
oriented monetary policy.2 Reform-  induced 
higher potential growth also increases the 
room for manoeuvre for conventional monet -
ary policy measures, as the equilibrium real 
interest rate positively depends on the growth 
rate of potential output. A higher equilibrium 
real interest rate reduces the likelihood of mon -
etary policy hitting the zero lower bound. 
Lastly, effective regulation and supervision of 
financial markets can facilitate monetary policy 
transmission and prevent critical escalation.
Structural impediments  
in the euro area
Evidence from macroeconomic 
indicators
The existence of structural impediments can be 
deduced from economic indicators. For ex -
ample, a high level of unemployment that per -
sists over a longer period of time could be indi -
cative of rigidities in the labour market. In fact, 
from 2005 to 2018, the average unemploy -
ment rate in the euro area was considerably 
higher than in other advanced economies.3

1 New Keynesian general equilibrium models can be used 
to show, for example, that rigidities in labour and product 
markets can dampen the effect of monetary policy on the 
rate of inflation. See, inter alia, Woodford (2003) and 
Christoffel et al. (2009). For more information on the impli -
cations of deregulation for monetary policy, see also Cac -
ciatore et al. (2016a).
2 For more information, see Mundell (1961), Duval and 
Vogel  (2008), Canova et al. (2012), Giudice et al. (2018), 
and Masuch et al. (2018). Nevertheless, some studies point 
out that the stabilising effect of wage and price flexibility 
– two specific forms of product and labour market flexibil -
ity – can be dependent on the macroeconomic environ -
ment as well as the responsiveness of monetary policy. See, 
inter alia, Bhattarai et al. (2018) and Billi and Galí (2019).

such as those in some euro area countries, can 
be interpreted as being indicative of dysfunc -
tions. The same applies to entrenched under -
employment in sub- sectors of the labour mar -
ket, such as among young or older people, as 
well as long-  term unemployment.4 The em -
ployment rate in the euro area has likewise 
been relatively low, even though Germany, for 
example, exhibits quite a high employment- to- 
population ratio by international standards.
In addition to the rate of employment, prod -
uctivity growth is especially important for eco -
nomic performance over the medium to long 
term. In the euro area, labour productivity 
growth has been subdued overall during the 
past 15 years.5 In this context, marked differ -
ences within the euro area become apparent. 
Even when measured against the dampened 
productivity growth in other industrial coun -
tries, some euro area Member States have 
lagged behind considerably.
Evidence from structural 
 indicators
Indicators that seek to capture the degree and 
quality of regulation as well as the efficiency of 
government action can likewise be useful when 
looking for the causes of structural problems. Here, it should be noted that individual struc -
tural indicators sometimes capture highly spe -
cific rigidities. Generally, however, such indica -
tors can be useful in evaluating the importance 
of structural impediments.
In order to assess labour market flexibility, for 
example, the OECD indicator for employment 
protection legislation for regular workers is fre -
quently used. This indicator aims to capture 
barriers to terminating employment contracts 
on the part of the employer. Amongst other 
factors, notice periods and compensation pay -
ments are taken into account.6 The data ob -
tained from annual surveys of OECD Member 
State governments are weighted and summar -
ised in an indicator, which ranges from zero 
(least restrictive) to six (most restrictive). How -

4 When interpreting the number of long- term unemployed 
persons as a percentage of total unemployment, it must be 
taken into consideration that a cyclical decline in un -
employment can lead to a rise in the long- term unemploy -
ment rate for conceptual reasons. This contributes, for ex -
ample – despite a considerable fall in unemployment – to 
the comparatively high average proportion of long- term 
unemployed persons in Germany between 2005 and 2018.
5 In addition, it should be noted that the euro area average 
is skewed positively by Ireland and the new Member States, 
which are catching up from a low starting level. For more 
information on the problems in measuring Irish growth fig -
ures, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018).

be noted that a low value for the employment 
protection legislation indicator is not an essen -
tial prerequisite for a good labour market out -
come. Instead, this depends on the interaction 
between the various labour market institutions. 
Germany, for example, exhibits a medium in -
tensity of regulation with regard to employ -
ment protection, but ranks highly in terms of 
labour market outcome. Nevertheless, there 
are indications that restrictive employment pro -
tection legislation adversely affects employ -
ment and productivity growth.7
According to the OECD indicator, regulatory in -
tensity with regard to employment protection 
in the euro area diminished slightly between 
1998 and 2013.8 This was due not least to the 
deregulation efforts in the countries that were 
hit hardest by the crisis – Greece, Portugal and 
Spain – which entered assistance programmes 
that were conditional on reform. Nevertheless, 
the indicator still exceeded the OECD average 
in 2013. Within the euro area, employment 
protection was least restrictive in Ireland and 
–  despite considerable relaxation  – most re -
strictive in Portugal.
The OECD additionally attempts to capture 
regulatory intensity in the product markets of 
its Member States. For this purpose, it collects 
information from governments regarding, 
amongst other things, price controls, restric -
tions on foreign direct investment, and admin -
istrative burdens on start- ups. For the retail 
trade sector, for example, information on regu -
lations governing opening hours and sales is 
gathered. The indicator is equally weighted 
across sectors and, as of 1998, has been recal -
culated every five years. However, the calcula -
tion method was changed in 2018 without 
retroactive adjustment, allowing for a consist -
ent intertemporal comparison only up to 2013.Relatively strict

Overall, there was a considerable decline in 
regulatory intensity on euro area product mar -
kets between 1998 and 2013. These declines 
were especially pronounced in Portugal, Italy 
and Greece. However, Spain, Germany and 
France also saw considerable deregulation. The 
consolidation of the European Single Market 
undoubtedly played a role in this. Nevertheless, 
deregulation of product markets was not 
unique to the euro area. This development has, 
in fact, been a widespread international phe -
nomenon, as shown by the change in the 
OECD average.9 However, in 2013, the euro 
area actually fell below the OECD average, 
which it had still exceeded in 1998.
A similar picture is painted by the conceptually 
revised OECD indicator from 2018.10 The euro 
area is below the OECD average in this context, 
too. The distance from the average of the three 
OECD countries with the least restrictive prod -
uct market regulation (EU Member States 
United Kingdom and Denmark as well as euro area Member State Spain) nevertheless sug -
gests that individual euro area countries still 
have comparatively restrictive regulation. How -
ever, these discrepancies are also partly attrib -
utable to state ownership of enterprises – as in 
the case of France – which the OECD records 
as a form of product market regulation. In 
other countries, such as Greece, it is due to 
complex administrative requirements. With re -Strong deregula -

10 Up until the overhaul in 2018, the indicator was com -
posed of three sub- components: state control, barriers to

These areas have now been consolidated into two com -
ponents (distortions induced by state involvement on the 
one hand and barriers to domestic and foreign entry on the 
other). In addition, new sectors (such as water and e-  
communications) were introduced, the survey of the ser -
vices sector was extended to additional professions (includ -
ing estate agents and notaries), and new elements, such as 
businesses’ assessments of the impact of regulation on 
competition, were taken into account. For a detailed de -
scription of the calculation method used up until 2013, see

Regulation of the professional services in Germany
Since the late 1990s, Germany has seen a 
considerable reduction in barriers to trade 
and market entry on markets which, up to 
then, had been relatively highly regulated. 
Reform progress is refl  ected in the OECD’s 
economy- wide Product Market Regulation 
(PMR) Indicator, which shows a consider-
able decline for Germany between 1998 
and 2013.1 Despite the considerable reform 
progress, including in network industries, 
Germany’s services sector still appears to be 
quite highly regulated relative to other 
countries. International institutions, in par-
ticular, have already repeatedly proposed 
additional reforms, notably in what are 
known as the professional services.2
A breakdown of the OECD indicator by pro-
fession can give an idea of which profes-
sional services remain particularly highly 
regulated.3 There is evidence of overregula-
tion if, for a given profession, the OECD in-
dicator displays clearly more restrictive 
regulation than in the reference group of 
other EU countries.4 High indicator values in 
professions across countries, on the other 
hand, could be a sign that regulation, for 
instance, is intended to deliver on import-
ant consumer or health protection object-ives. To that extent, this measure also takes 
into account that regulation is not neces-
sarily disadvantageous or ineffi   cient and 
therefore that relaxing regulation does not 
necessarily improve welfare.5
In order to ascertain those profession- 
related regulations that contribute signifi  -
cantly to the high value of the OECD indica-
tor, it is possible to identify the individual 
regulations whose attributes exhibit above- 
average values for Germany. Of interest 
here are, in particular, areas in which regu-
1 Indicators for the years 1998 to 2013 are based on a 
uniform methodology. The indicator has recently been 
overhauled by the OECD; see Vitale et al. (2019). Com-
parability between the updated indicator for 2018 
with the values from previous years is extremely limited 
owing to the changes in the methodology. No consist-
ent backcasting has yet been performed.
2 See, for example, European Commission (2017a) and 
International Monetary Fund (2018). According to sec-
tion 18 of the German Income Tax Act, the profes-
sional services comprise the “independent professional 
exercise of scientifi  c, artistic, literary, teaching or edu-
cational activity, the independent professional occupa-
tions of physicians, dentists, veterinary practitioners, 
lawyers, notaries, patent agents, land surveyors, en-
gineers, architects, trade chemists, accountants, tax 
consultants, consultant economists and business 
economists, chartered accountants, tax agents, non- 
medical practitioners, dentists, physiotherapists, jour-
nalists, photojournalists, interpreters, translators, pilots 
and similar professions”.
3 The indicators refer to the following areas: e- 
telecommunications, electricity, natural gas, air trans-
port, rail transport, road transport and water transport, 
as well as six professions in the services sector (law-
yers, accountants, engineers, architects, notaries and 
estate agents). There are also indicators for retail distri-
bution and retail sales of medicines.
4 Country- specifi  c features (such as regulation through 
complementary instruments not covered by the OECD 
indicator) – given a de facto similar degree of regula-
tion – can cause differences in the reported degree of 
regulation between countries. Results are similar if the 
OECD countries (excluding Germany) are taken as a 
reference group.
5 This approach is also conceptually suited to identify-
ing professions with an especially low degree of regu-
lation by international standards. According to the 
data regarding the professional services in Germany, 
this pertains to the activities of estate agents in par-
ticular.Product market regulation in Germany *

lation does not appear to be urgently ne-
cessary in order to assure service quality.6
The professions that appear to be more 
strictly regulated in Germany by inter-
national standards are notaries, account-
ants and engineers. First, according to the 
OECD, barriers to market entry are quite 
high for these professions. In the case of 
notaries, this pertains to the regional distri-
bution of business areas within Germany 
and regional quotas on the number of no-
taries. As regards accountants, the require-
ments relating to professional experience 
–  in addition to the state examination  – 
motivated by the need for quality assurance 
seem very high in some accountant training 
courses.7 For engineers, access to the mar-
ket – especially for foreign graduates – is 
impaired. The recognition procedures for 
EU and EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Nor-
way and Switzerland) citizens are currently 
the responsibility of the federal states and 
could potentially appear cumbersome and 
opaque to non- residents.
Second, more market- based price setting 
– as opposed to the current mandatory fee 
scale for notaries and the Offi   cial Scale of 
Fees for Services by Architects and Engin-
eers (Honorarordnung für Architekten und 
Ingenieure)  – could foster competition.8 
Though it would be wrong to dismiss con-
cerns about price competition at the ex-
pense of service quality, it is questionable 
whether the currently high level of regula-
tion is justifi  ed.
Reducing the density of regulation in these 
areas would probably foster competition and 
bring about positive spillover effects to up-
stream and downstream sectors. As profes-
sional services do not make up a large share 
of aggregate value added, the macroeco-
nomic impact of such measures is likely to be 
rather small.9 Nonetheless, this should not 
be construed as an argument in favour of 
maintaining regulation that inhibits competi-
tion. Special regulatory protections for some individual areas tend to increase demand for 
such privileged treatment elsewhere. In add-
ition, restrictions on market entry reduce so-
cial mobility and impair equality of opportun-
ity. Lastly, reforms in the professions cited 
here by way of illustration could provide an 
impetus for similar measures in other sectors 
or professions. The macroeconomic impact 
of a more comprehensive reform package 
would then be higher.
6 Asymmetric information or adverse selection can ne-
cessitate regulatory provisions in order to avoid 
watered- down quality standards or ineffi   cient price or 
wage setting. This analysis abstracts from possible 
interactions between regulatory measures within the 
individual sub- categories. Nevertheless, various com-
binations of individual measures could bring about a 
similar effect on overall regulation.
7 As part of the Third Bureaucracy Relief Act (Drittes 
Bürokratieentlastungsgesetz), there are plans to re-
duce the amount of professional experience needed 
for admission to the accountant examination.
8 See also German Council of Economic Experts 
(2016). The European Court of Justice recently ruled 
that fi  xed minimum and maximum fees for services by 
architects and engineers pursuant to the Offi   cial Scale 
of Fees for Services by Architects and Engineers (Hono-
rarordnung für Architekten und Ingenieure)  violated 
EU law. Fixed minimum and maximum fees are there-
fore null and void. See European Court of Justice 
(2019).
9 Krebs and Scheffel (2016) use a DSGE model to ana-
lyse, inter alia, a reform scenario in which the price 
mark- up of professional services in Germany is reduced 
by 4  percentage points. Under such a hypothetical 
scenario, ten years after implementing the reforms, 
potential output, for instance, would be just over 0.1% 
higher than in a comparable scenario without reforms.Product market regulation for

gard to barriers to market entry, barriers in the 
service and network sectors11 play a relatively 
large role. Particularly in Italy, Spain, Greece 
and Portugal, but also in Germany, these are 
the most significant barriers in terms of restric -
tions to market entry (see also the box on 
pp.  88-89). According to the OECD, market 
entry in other euro area countries, such as 
France and Ireland, is also adversely affected by 
the administrative burden on business start-  
ups.
However, the regulation of labour and product 
markets is not the only source of structural im -
pediments. The overall quality of public admin -
istration as well as of the judicial and educa -
tional systems likewise has an impact on a 
country’s economic performance. The World 
Economic Forum’s competitiveness indicator, 
which is predominantly based on surveys of 
business managers, attempts to capture this as -
pect. In this context, a sub- indicator provides 
information on institutional quality, which com -prises factors such as protection of property 
rights, judicial independence, and the strength 
of auditing and accounting standards.12
According to the “Institutions” sub- indicator, 
the quality assessment for the euro area in 
2018 and 2019 corresponded to the OECD 
average.13 However, there are also considerable 
differences between the individual countries of 
the euro area. Some countries are well below 
the euro area average.14 Accordingly, there 
exist marked deviations from the average of 
the three OECD countries with the highest 
scores (euro area Member States Finland and 
the Netherlands, as well as New Zealand).
Despite the limited informative value of individ -
ual structural indicators, they add to the gen -
eral picture outlined by the macroeconomic in -
dicators. For instance, regulation in some euro 
area countries – despite substantial efforts to -
wards deregulation on labour and product 
markets in some cases – remains strict by inter -
national standards. Moreover, institutional 
quality is not assessed as being very high in 
some euro area Member States. This also ap -
pears to be reflected in the macroeconomic in -
dicators in some cases.

typically utilised when analysing the economic 
impact of structural reforms. The results of such 
analyses also serve as guidance for policymakers.
Studies based on structural 
macroeconomic models
Structural reforms often have various spillover 
effects and must therefore be modelled ac -
cordingly. Dynamic stochastic general equilib -
rium (DSGE) models are especially suited to this 
purpose. These models seek to explain macro -
economic interactions and developments based 
on the individual optimal decision rules of ra -
tional economic agents.15 This allows for rela -
tively detailed modelling of specific transmis -
sion channels and relationships.
However, structural impediments are captured, 
in part, in a highly stylised way in DSGE frame -
works and are modelled, for example, as imper -
fect competition on labour and product markets 
or as wage and price rigidities. Within such set-  
ups, structural reforms reduce trade unions’ and 
firms’ power to set wages and prices and also 
lower the costs of wage and price adjustments.16 
Alternatively, structural reforms are modelled 
merely as exogenous changes in key macroeco -
nomic variables, such as productivity or labour 
supply. These shocks are usually specified on the 
basis of empirical studies on the impact of struc -
tural reforms on these variables.17 By contrast, 
more complex DSGE approaches feature detailed 
representations of labour and product markets. 
In these model variants, specific reform measures 
–  such as the reduction of barriers to market 
entry or adjustments to employment protection 
and unemployment benefits  – can be investi -
gated directly (see the box on pp. 92-93). In this 
way, the impact of reforms on the degree of 
competition as well as on productivity and em -
ployment are often endogenously determined.18
Despite these differences in the level of detail, 
DSGE analyses paint a uniform picture: meas -
ures that promote competition on labour and 
product markets can lead to strong increases in productivity, employment and investment over 
the long term. The same applies to reforms 
that promote human capital through improved 
access to education and to the implementation 
of active labour market policies.19 DSGE studies 
show, for example, that the favourable labour 
market developments in Germany can be at -
tributed not least to the labour market reforms 
of the mid-2000s.20
The findings are less homogeneous with regard 
to the short to medium- run effects of structural 
measures. While structural reforms can have 
positive effects as early as the short run in some 
DSGE analyses,21 they can – if the macroeco -
nomic conditions are unfavourable – also ini -
tially cause the overall economic situation to 
deteriorate. For example, DSGE simulations of 
the impact of a relaxation in employment pro -
tection indicate that the reform-induced rise in 
job- seeking would be amplified during a period 
of economic weakness.22
Studies based on statistical 
 regression models
Statistical regression analyses can also help to 
shed light on the macroeconomic effects of 
structural reforms. These investigations look at 
individual country- specific reform measures or 
at the macroeconomic assessment of structural 
reforms across countries. However, obtaining 
evidence of reform effects is challenging from a Macroeconomic

Implementing structural reforms in DSGE models
Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) models are a standard tool in mod-
ern quantitative macroeconomics. This cat-
egory of equilibrium models generally seeks 
to explain macroeconomic relationships 
and developments based on the individual 
optimal decision rules of rational economic 
agents.1 In those models, market imperfec-
tions, such as distortion of competition or 
wage and price rigidities, can be taken into 
account. Therefore, DSGE models are also 
useful in assessing the effects of structural 
reforms. However, presenting specific 
causal relationships, even in their most sim-
plifi  ed form, can create complex model 
structures. This might, at times, imply a 
trade- off between the models’ tractability 
and their ability to precisely capture observ-
able characteristics of the economy.
The potential importance of the selected 
degree of detail for the reported effects 
shows up, for instance, when modelling 
product market reforms. For example, the 
removal of competitive distortion in the 
product markets can be implemented in 
DSGE models in a relatively abstract manner 
using an exogenously assumed reduction in 
fi  rms’ price mark- ups.2 Even though such 
an experiment is generally able to capture 
the macroeconomic reform effects, the 
scope for deriving actual policy measures is 
only very limited.
On the other hand, there exist modelling 
frameworks which provide a detailed repre-
sentation of product markets. Such setups 
include DSGE models with endogenous 
market entry and exit, where a relationship 
between market concentration and price 
mark- ups is determined endogenously in 
the model.3 Reforms to intensify competi-
tion are modelled in such a framework as, for instance, a reduction of barriers to mar-
ket entry.
While the outcomes regarding the long- run 
real economic effects of reform are qualita-
tively consistent irrespective of the specifi  c 
model used – intensifi  ed competition stimu-
lates macroeconomic activity and employ-
ment  – such an unambiguous causality 
does not hold in the short run, however.
Using a prototypical DSGE model, it can be 
shown, for instance, that the way product 
markets are modelled has a meaningful im-
pact on the short- run price effects of 
competition- enhancing product market re-
forms. In a simple baseline New Keynesian 
model, an exogenous decrease in price 
mark- ups directly reduces the infl  ation rate, 
thereby leading to an increase in aggregate 
demand.4 Although the latter will tend to 
push prices up, this is not suffi   cient to offset 
the immediate decline in prices. Overall, 
prices are dampened.
The presence of endogenous market entry 
and exit by fi  rms changes the situation with 
regard to price dynamics. Under these cir-
cumstances, intensifi  ed competition owing 
1 DSGE models usually assume that economic agents 
do not make any systematic errors when forming their 
expectations and that they make optimum use of all 
the information that is available to them. In this sense, 
they behave “rationally”.

tore et al. (2016a), and Colciago (2018).
4 To this end, an exogenous reduction in price mark- 
ups from 30% to 25% was simulated. The analytical 
framework used here was a simple baseline New 
Keynesian model with imperfect competition, quad-
ratic price adjustment costs and no physical capital. In 
this stylised model framework, the number of fi  rms is 
assumed to be constant. The potential infl  uence of 
competition- enhancing product market reforms on 
business dynamism is therefore ignored. For more in-
formation, see Ireland (2004).Deutsche Bundesbank

to a reduction of barriers to market entry 
will tend to increase the rate of infl  ation.5 
The price- increasing effect of the rise in 
macroeconomic demand outweighs the 
price- dampening effect of the endogenous 
reduction in margins. Demand is stimulated 
not only by expenditure for new fi  rms to 
enter the market but also rising labour in-
comes on account of the increased demand 
for factor inputs.
This fi  nding is noteworthy inasmuch as po-
tential short- run price- reducing effects of 
structural reforms have assumed quite a 
prominent role in the recent economic pol-
icy debate, in which – referring to DSGE 
analyses6 – the potential short- run costs of 
structural reforms given a binding zero 
lower bound (ZLB) have been discussed.7 
Specifi  cally, it has been argued that – given 
a binding nominal ZLB – a reform- induced 
dampening of prices would push up real 
interest rates.8 However, an increase in real 
interest rates usually dampens aggregate 
demand. This has, not least, resulted in calls 
for policy measures to boost demand in 
order to supplement structural reforms.
The simulation analysis presented here illus-
trates, however, that such model results 
could prove not to be very robust and 
should therefore be interpreted with cau-
tion.9 More recent studies likewise show 
that it is the macroeconomic situation, 
more than the general interest rate environ-
ment, which drives the short- run effects of 
structural measures. Specifi  cally, the fi  nd-
ings indicate that, during a phase of cyclical 
weakness, structural reforms are more likely 
to be associated with temporary macroeco-
nomic costs than in a favourable macroeco-
nomic environment.105 The baseline New Keynesian model was expanded 
here such that fi  rms fi  rst have to decide whether, given 
the costs of market entry, they wish to enter the mar-
ket (endogenous market entry). The number of market 
participants determines fi  rms’ market power and thus 
the size of price mark- ups. A detailed description of 
the mechanism may be found, inter alia, in Jaimovich 
and Floetotto (2008). For the sake of comparability, in 
this simulated scenario fi  rms’ entry costs were reduced 
to such an extent that the intensifi  ed competition trig-
gered by the subsequent increase in the number of 
fi  rms operating in the market causes price mark- ups to 
likewise drop from 30% to 25%.

methodological perspective.23 One reason for 
this is that cyclical developments or other eco -
nomic policy measures can mask the effects of 
structural reforms. For instance, disentangling 
the impact of a reform measure adopted dur -
ing an economic downturn from the side ef -
fects of a subsequent macroeconomic recovery 
is no straightforward task.24 Another reason is 
that the cyclical position as well as economic 
policy stances are likely to have a major influ -
ence on the effectiveness of structural reforms. 
For example, reform- induced adjustment pro -
cesses may unfold more slowly during a period 
of economic weakness.
Assessing the macroeconomic effects of struc -
tural reforms also requires that relevant policy 
measures be properly identified. This is a chal -
lenge especially in the case of cross- country 
analyses. While structural indicators could sig -
nal that reform measures are being imple -
mented, these indicators sometimes tend to 
represent rough approximations. For example, 
the difference between reform resolutions and 
their actual implementation is not always clear 
cut. Additionally, it is difficult to measure the 
depth and scope of various reforms or reform 
programmes adequately. “Narrative ap -
proaches” that identify structural reforms by 
analysing the content of relevant media may 
serve as a supplement in this regard.25 Ultim -
ately, however, this method is based on sub -
jective selection criteria.
In general, regression analyses also provide 
clear evidence of the positive long- term macro -
economic effects of structural reforms.26 A 
number of studies show that adjustments to 
the amount and duration of unemployment 
benefits, the design and deployment of active 
labour market policy measures and the lifting 
of impediments to competition in labour and 
product markets may contribute, on average, 
to a sustainable increase in investment, em -
ployment and productivity.27 For instance, there 
are numerous examples that show the positive 
macroeconomic effects of the labour market reforms that were carried out in Germany in 
the mid-2000s.28
Analyses of the short- run impact of structural 
reforms once again present a mixed picture. 
While some studies already find positive reform 
effects in the short term, other analyses sug -
gest signs of a negative impact, especially given 
an unfavourable macroeconomic situation.29 In 
this respect, some empirical evidence indicates 
that labour market reforms during an economic 
downturn are more likely to cause temporary 
negative employment effects compared to re -
forms conducted under favourable economic 
conditions.30 Studies on the impact of labour 
market reforms in Germany and Spain indicate 
at least a clearly muted positive reform effect 
during recessions.31 These findings suggest that 
it is preferable to implement reforms during fa -
vourable cyclical periods.
Reform intensity  
in the euro area
Existing reform potential and the expected 
positive long- run macroeconomic impact of 
structural measures would suggest that reform 
intensity has increased in the euro area – espe -
cially since the macroeconomic environment 
has improved significantly in recent years and is 
now more supportive of successful reforms. 
This does not appear to have been the case re -
cently, however.

This is at least what is indicated by reports on 
implemented reform measures in specific coun -
tries and groups of countries by the European 
Commission and the OECD. They refer to the 
economic policy recommendations that are 
prepared on a regular basis by the European 
Commission32 and the OECD,33 respectively, 
and in some cases in cooperation with the na -
tional governments and experts. These recom -
mendations target best practices while taking 
into account country- specific circumstances, 
including its macroeconomic situation. Often, 
the recommendations of both institutions over -
lap, but not always.
Since 2008 the OECD has published a corres -
ponding annual indicator on reform progress in 
the member countries.34 For the euro area as a 
whole, the indicator has recently signalled 
merely moderate reform intensity, after the im -
plementation of recommendations reached its 
peak in 2011-12. The high reform intensity in 
the aftermath of the global financial and eco -
nomic crisis and during the sovereign debt cri -
sis was primarily attributable to measures in the 
programme countries Greece, Ireland, Portugal 
and Spain. Thereafter, the reform intensity sub -
sided markedly in these countries and dropped 
below the level of non- programme countries in 
2015. Meaningful progress was subsequently 
made only in Ireland and Greece. The OECD’s 
latest references to functional shortcomings in 
the labour markets and labour market institu -
tions as well as to potential improvements in 
public administration suggest that, despite the 
extensive measures taken, this group of coun -
tries is still in need of reforms.35 In the rest of 
the euro area Member States, the status of im -
plementation of OECD recommendations at 
the current end was at the level of 2007-08. 
Here, too, the OECD has identified further po -
tential for reform in the labour markets, in the 
education system and in public administration.
In the context of the European Semester, the 
European Commission annually assesses the 
implementation of country- specific reform rec -
ommendations.36 This evaluation covers, inter alia, measures to improve the performance of 
product and labour markets as well as of the 
judicial and education system and public ad -
ministration. No distinction is made with regard 
to the scope and depth of the reforms. Like -
wise, the withdrawal of measures is not taken 
into account immediately. These data also 
show a waning reform momentum. It is par -
ticularly noteworthy that none of the measures 
already initiated in the reform areas listed 
above can be classified as “full progress” ac -
cording to the European Commission’s assess -
ment. However, it should be highlighted that 
the implementation of structural reforms is 
often accompanied by a lengthy legislative pro -
cess, which is reflected in the high proportion 
of measures that have achieved “some pro -Implementation

gress”. Their share, however, declined in 2018 
as well. Differences between the euro area 
countries have also become evident in the im -
plementation of country- specific recommenda -
tions. Since 2016 the French government, for 
example, has initiated a series of labour market 
and educational reforms and taken liberalisa -
tion measures in the services and transport sec -
tors. By contrast, the implementation of 
country- specific recommendations has been 
rather   sluggish in other euro area countries, 
including  Germany.
Resistance to structural 
 reforms and ways 
to  overcome it
Reservations regarding 
 structural reforms
The evaluations of the OECD and the European 
Commission illustrate that reform intensity in 
the euro area has abated in recent years. Only 
a few countries have taken advantage of the 
more favourable macroeconomic conditions to 
implement additional reform measures. The 
question arises as to how this can be explained. 
Concerns over transition costs certainly play a 
role. Unemployment can rise temporarily after 
employment protection rules are relaxed. Moreover, an improvement in business dyna -
mism caused by the reforms can also dampen 
labour demand in the short run.37 However, it 
is especially in a weak macroeconomic environ -
ment that adverse transition effects occur.38 
This is noteworthy in that severe crises are at 
times seen as triggers for structural reforms.39 
In this case, however, the urgent necessity for 
structural reforms may overshadow any poten -
tial transition costs, even if these are amplified 
by the crisis.
In the economic policy debate in recent years, 
considerations of potential additional short-  
term costs of structural reforms in a low-  
interest- rate environment have also played a 
role. If an economy is constrained at the (nom -
inal) zero lower bound and the scope for mon -
etary policy is therefore limited, labour and 
product reforms, which –  due to a boost in 
competition  – tend to weigh on wages and 
prices, could dampen economic activity in the 
short term via the real interest channel.40 On 
closer inspection, however, it appears that this 
result is not very robust (for more information, 
see the box on pp. 92 f.).
Unwanted distributional consequences also 
represent a potential obstacle to reform. For in -
stance, cuts in unemployment benefits could 
reinforce the incentive to take up full- time em -
ployment and contribute to an improvement in 
the overall situation on the labour market. For 
some people, however, this could entail a long- 
term loss in income owing to lower unemploy -
ment benefits and lower wages. Reform-  
induced income gains may also vary markedly 
between income classes.41 Even though such 
considerations on the distributional impact of 
structural reforms have thus far been based 
solely on a small number of empirical find -Opposition to

ings,42 they may nevertheless serve as an ex -
planation for the low social acceptance and 
political viability of structural reforms.43 In this 
context, it is important to note that the existing 
uncertainty about the consequences of struc -
tural measures can already dampen the willing -
ness to implement reforms.44 Moreover, it 
should be noted that even small interest groups 
can exert distinct political influence.45
A lack of willingness to embrace reforms may 
also be explained by the delayed impact of 
structural measures. While the full effects of 
structural reforms are typically only seen in the 
medium to long run, the time horizon of pol -
icymakers is at times rather short and aligned 
with national electoral cycles.46
Instruments to support 
 structural reforms
If short- term adjustment costs and distribu -
tional effects obstruct reforms that promise to 
be effective in the long run, there are a variety 
of strategies to address this. Besides focusing 
on key reform areas and packaging measures, 
their decisive implementation plays a pivotal 
role.47
First, a package of measures is more likely to 
have a stronger macroeconomic impact than 
individual measures.48 This packaging of meas -
ures is especially effective if complementarities 
come into play. For instance, it can be shown 
that the positive impact of wage flexibility for 
countries in a monetary union crucially hinges 
on product prices being sufficiently respon -
sive.49 The success of labour and product mar -
ket reforms is influenced markedly by the qual -
ity of the judicial, public administration and 
education systems.50 The implementation of 
structural reforms will scarcely be possible if 
public institutions are insufficiently efficient.
Second, coherent packages of reforms may 
counteract the adverse effects of individual 
measures. Certain structural reforms, such as relaxing employment protection regulations, 
may dampen demand in the short run. Well-  
designed packages of product and labour mar -
ket reforms can mitigate this effect.51
In this context, the sequence of reform meas -
ures is also important. The sequential order in 
which measures are implemented may increase … and the

or decrease their social acceptance and polit -
ical viability.52 For instance, the implementation 
of product market reforms that raise purchas -
ing power could make labour market reforms 
that are likely to dampen wages easier for the 
public to swallow.53
Furthermore, the macroeconomic environment 
may suggest a specific sequencing of reforms. 
While, for instance, an easing of employment 
protection legislation may initially worsen the 
overall economic situation due to dampening 
effects on demand, especially when macroeco -
nomic activity is subdued, this does not appear 
to hold for competition- enhancing product 
market reforms.54 It is therefore conceivable 
that product market reforms that bolster de -
mand are preferred during a macroeconomic 
downturn.
Due to various interdependencies, consider -
ation of the specific regulatory and institutional 
environment is a requirement for successful 
measures. For example, the effects of product 
market reforms also depend on how flexible 
the labour markets are.55 Conversely, the im -
pact of labour market reforms can also be influ -
enced by the product market situation.56
The effectiveness of structural reforms can be 
strengthened by a credible commitment of pol -
icymakers to a reform path.57 In this case, the 
expectation of long- term productivity and in -
come growth can already stimulate demand in 
the short term.58 These income and confidence 
effects may counteract short- term reform 
costs, especially in a weak macroeconomic en -
vironment.59
Fiscal policy, too, can support the implementa -
tion of structural reforms.60 Measures that 
stimulate demand can counteract short- term 
reform costs. In addition, fiscal policy has the 
ability to respond to undesirable distributional 
effects. For instance, a possible decline in 
wages in the course of labour market reforms 
can be countered by easing the tax burden on 
labour, as during the German labour market re -forms of the first half of the 2000s.61 However, 
this requires a sufficiently large fiscal buffer. The 
impact of debt- financed fiscal measures, for ex -
ample, depends crucially on the trust in the 
sustainability of public finances.62
Lastly, reforms implemented at the EU level can 
also help to remove structural impediments. 
These include, besides the banking union al -
ready initiated, a deeper integration of capital 
markets and measures to facilitate cross- border 
labour mobility. EU- wide reforms can only sup -
plement national efforts, however. The respon -
sibility for key policy areas in the EU remains at 
the national level. The country- specific recom -
mendations in the European Semester can only 
initiate and support reform processes; national 
ownership is crucial for their implementation.63
Conclusion
Despite, in some cases, considerable reform 
progress, especially in the aftermath of the 
global financial and economic crisis and the 
subsequent sovereign debt crisis, structural im -
pediments continue to pose economic policy 
challenges to the economies of the euro area.

favourable macroeconomic environment has 
been used adequately for the implementation 
of reforms. The primary responsibility for imple -
mentation lies at the national level, and struc -
tural reforms are intended to foster economic 
prosperity first and foremost in the individual Member States. At the same time, it should be 
emphasised that a successful common monet -
ary policy requires well- functioning labour, 
financial  and product markets. For that reason, 
the removal of structural rigidities is also of 
interest from a monetary policy perspective.
