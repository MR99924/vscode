Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Overall output is likely to have risen quite 
steeply in the final quarter of 2013. Alongside 
the still expansionary domestic economic stim -
uli, mainly from private consumption, external 
demand increasingly provided impetus. Indus -
trial activity again proved to be the supporting 
factor for economic growth. Industrial output 
increased substantially in November, as ex -
pected, and more than compensated for the 
temporary lull in October. For the first quarter 
of 2014, a further acceleration of the overall 
economy is evident, as industrial activity is likely 
to gain momentum. This is not only suggested 
by the sharp improvement in prospects for ex -
port and production since autumn presented in 
the Ifo Institute’s survey, but is also consistent 
with the robust increase in orders received, 
particularly in intermediate goods and in the 
automotive industry.
According to the provisional calculations of the 
Federal Statistical Office, real gross domestic 
product expanded by 0.4% (0.5% after calen -
dar adjustment) in 2013. Thus, overall output 
again reported only a weak increase following 
the depressed growth of 0.7% in the previous 
year. This reflected a lack of impetus from for -
eign demand due to the continuing adjustment 
process in the euro area, as well as the sub -
dued growth in other major industrial countries 
and emerging markets, which also dampened 
German enterprises’ propensity to invest.
Industry
In November, industrial activity grew by a sea -
sonally adjusted 3% on the month. The signifi -
cant increase more than offset the decline in 
October, triggered by bridging day effects and 
short- time work in parts of the automotive  industry. Taking the average of October and 
November, the third- quarter level was sur -
passed by ½%. Nevertheless, slightly fewer 
capital goods were produced (-½%). By con -
trast, the production of intermediate goods 
 expanded distinctly (+1¾%). The output of 
consumer goods increased somewhat (+½%).
In November, the inflow of orders for German 
industry recorded a steep seasonally adjusted 
rise of 2% on the month, principally due to 
 numerous large orders. This is reflected in the 
strong 3¼% rise in orders of capital goods. In 
addition, there was a significant increase of 2% 
in consumer goods whilst the orders of inter -
mediate goods rose only slightly (+½%). On an 
average of October and November, demand 
was up ¾% on the previous quarter’s level. 
 Although domestic orders declined (-1%), for -
eign orders rose significantly (+2¼%). There 
was a stronger increase (+3¾%) in orders from 
the euro area than from non- euro- area coun -
tries (+1½%), with orders from the aircraft and 
aerospace industry playing an important role. 
Overall, there was a remarkably steep rise in 
orders for intermediate goods (+2½%), which 
came to a particular extent from both non-  
euro- area countries and the euro area. By con -
trast, new orders for capital goods did not 
quite match the level of the third quarter 
(-¼%), which had been boosted by particularly 
numerous large orders.
On average in October and November, indus -
trial sales rose by 2% in seasonally adjusted 
terms compared with the third quarter. Whilst 
domestic sales increased only slightly (+½%), 
there was a substantial 3¼% rise in foreign 
sales. Sales in non- euro- area countries expanded 
particularly sharply (+3¾%) following the de -
cline in the summer and sales in the euro area 
also saw a rise (+2¼%). The seasonally  adjusted 
value of goods exports in November again in -
creased only marginally on the month (+¼%), 
but the average of October and November was Accelerating

1¾% above that of the third quarter. The value 
of imports in November contracted markedly 
(-1%) compared with the strong October, but 
the average of the two months also surpassed 
the third- quarter level significantly.
Construction
Construction output in November advanced by 
a seasonally adjusted ¾% compared with the 
previous month, which had been revised up -
wards considerably. By contrast, there was 
a 1¾% decline in overall construction output, 
as output in the finishing trades –  whose 
 reports are, however, subject to considerable 
uncertainty as they are highly susceptible to 
 revision  – declined by 4¼%. Averaged over 
 October and November, construction output 
decreased by 2% compared with the third 
quarter. In the same period, new orders in the 
main construction sector recorded a rise of 
2¼% after seasonal adjustment. This was at -
tributable to the growth in orders in commer -
cial office buildings and in road construction.
Labour market
Employment continues to trend upwards. In 
November, the number of persons employed in 
Germany rose by 23,000 in seasonally adjusted 
terms. This represented a rise of 242,000, or 
+0.6%, on the same period last year. In Octo -
ber, regular jobs subject to social security 
 contributions recorded another marked sea -
sonally adjusted rise on the previous month 
(+37,000 persons). In sectoral terms, the in -
crease was more broadly based than in recent 
months. In addition to health and social work, 
additional jobs were filled mainly in manufac -
turing and trade. In year- on- year terms, the rise 
amounted to 359,000, or 1.2%. According to 
the Ifo employment barometer, enterprises’ 
willingness to recruit new staff virtually re -
mained at the elevated level of the previous 
month. The Federal Employment Agency’s 
BA- X job index improved distinctly.Decline in con-

The number of persons registered as un -
employed declined slightly in December by 
15,000 after seasonal adjustment. The un -
employment rate remained unchanged at 
6.9%. The year- on- year unemployment figure 
showed an increase of 33,000 persons. Sea -
sonally adjusted underemployment (excluding 
short- time work) was also down somewhat on 
the previous month.
Prices
In December, the price for a barrel of Brent 
crude oil fluctuated around the US$110 mark, 
2½% up on the previous month on average. At 
the turn of the year, the oil price showed a 
marked drop, which reflected the expectation 
of Libyan oil production returning to normal. 
As this report went to press, the price of a bar -
rel of crude oil stood at US$108. The discount 
on crude oil futures was just over US$2 for 
 deliveries six months ahead and just under 
US$5 for 12 months ahead.
After seasonal adjustment, import prices rose 
slightly by 0.1% in November on the month, 
following a steep drop previously. This also ap -
plies to the components energy and, to a lesser 
extent, other goods. Domestic industrial produ -
cer prices in November remained at the previ -
ous month’s level, as only energy producer 
prices showed a marginal decline and prices of 
other goods remained unchanged. They in -
creased again somewhat overall in December. 
Import prices in November were 2.9% down 
on the year; producer prices saw a 0.8% year- 
on- year decrease in November and 0.5% in 
 December. Compared with previous months, 
the annual decline in the prices of imports did 
not accelerate further, and in manufactured 
goods it decreased again in December.
Consumer prices in December remained un -
changed on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms. There was a slight rise in energy prices 
and even a fairly steep increase in food prices. 
By contrast, the prices of industrial products and services decreased and housing rents rose 
only marginally in comparison to the previous 
month. The year- on- year rate of inflation as 
measured by the national consumer price index 
(CPI) rose from 1.3% to 1.4% in November. In 
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) it declined from 1.6% to 1.2%, largely as 
a result of the elimination of distortions in the 
components accommodation services and 
package holidays.1 On average for 2013, an -
nual inflation, measured in terms of the CPI, 
went down from 2.0% in the previous year 
to 1.5%, and HICP inflation declined from 2.1% 
to 1.6%.
Public finances2
Local government finances
The financial situation of local government 
(core budgets and off- budget entities) deterior -
ated considerably in the third quarter of 2013. 
According to the Federal Statistical Office’s lat -
est cash statistics data, local government 
posted a deficit of €½ billion, compared with a 
surplus of almost €2 billion during the same 
period in 2012.3 Following strong growth in the 
previous quarters, revenue rose at a more sub -
dued pace overall (by 1½%, or just under €1 
billion). Flagging growth in tax receipts (+1½%, 
or just under €½ billion) was a key reason be -
hind this slowdown. In this context, a decline 
in net local business tax revenue could be off -Slight fall in

deviations between CPI and HICP inflation rates, Monthly 
Report, April 2013, p 7.
2 In the short report on public finances, the emphasis is on 
recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly Re -
port (published in February, May, August and November), 
by contrast, contain a detailed description of general gov -
ernment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For 
detailed statistical data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section.
3 Owing to the increased use of commercial double- entry 
bookkeeping among local governments, the results of indi -
vidual quarters are not published. For individual expend -
iture and revenue categories, a year- on- year comparison is 
also limited owing to the ongoing revision of the reporting 
population for the off- budget entities. Furthermore, only 
estimates are available for Saxony-  Anhalt for the third 
quarter of 2013.Deutsche Bundesbank

set by a rise in the municipal share of income 
tax. Despite continued robust growth in gen -
eral grants from state government, the overall 
increase in receipts from transfers by state gov -
ernment slowed down somewhat (+4½%, or 
just over €½ billion).
At the same time, expenditure was consider -
ably higher in year- on- year terms (up by 6½%, 
or just over €3 billion). This rise was primarily 
attributable to a very strong increase in spend -
ing on social benefits (+9½%, or €1 billion), in -
cluding, in particular, outlays for social assis -
tance, accommodation costs and assistance for 
young people. Fixed asset formation also went 
up significantly (+10½%, or €½ billion). Al -
though growth in personnel costs (+2½%) and 
other operating costs (+4%) was considerably 
more subdued, the resulting rise in expenditure 
was still just under €½ billion in each case.
Local government thus posted an aggregate 
deficit of €1½ billion for the first three quarters of 2013, a slight increase on the same period in 
2012. Therefore, the Stability Council’s Decem -
ber forecast of a considerable improvement in 
the budget balance for 2013 as a whole 
(around +€4 billion compared with the actual 
figures for 2012) now seems to be virtually un -
attainable.
In 2014, expenditure growth is likely to remain 
quite dynamic overall, not least on account of 
expected further increases in social benefits 
and fixed asset formation. The public- sector 
pay agreement for central and local govern -
ment, which is in the pipeline, could have a 
marked impact on the budgetary development. 
The consolidation requirements set out in the 
partial debt assumption programmes intro -
duced by some federal states are having a 
dampening effect. At the same time, however, 
transfers from state government are likely to in -
crease considerably. The final stage in expand -
ing central government’s contribution to the 
basic allowance for the elderly will alone ac -
count for €1 billion of this. In its coalition 
agreement, the new German government en -
visages a considerable amount of additional 
funding for local government in the coming 
years, to extend day care for small children and 
for spending on social benefits. For example, 
central government plans to contribute €1 bil -
lion initially, and then increase this amount to 
€5 billion annually in the medium term, to pro -
vide integration assistance for people with dis -
abilities. Against this backdrop, overall, local 
government budgets are set to record a gen -
eral rise in surpluses for 2014 and the subse -
quent years, although the differences between 
individual local authorities are likely to remain 
sizeable.
Taking account of the most recent budget def -
icit, at €137½ billion, local government debt 
(core budgets and off- budget entities, includ -
ing debt to the public sector) at the end of Sep -
tember was on a par with the level reported at 
the end of the previous quarter. Whereas credit 
market debt declined somewhat, cash ad -
vances rose by €½ billion to €48¾ billion. The … and a sharp

fact that this increase particularly concerned 
federal states that already have very high levels 
of outstanding cash advances, despite debt re -
lief programmes having already been imple -
mented in some cases, is worrisome. The ab -
solute increase was once again greatest in 
North Rhine-  Westphalia, with the aggregate 
figures for Saarland, Rhineland- Palatinate and 
Hesse also climbing further. Many local govern -
ments in these states, in particular, are still 
grappling with a need for extensive consolida -
tion; a task which is likely to become a lot more 
difficult if interest rates rise significantly. These 
local governments should therefore under no 
circumstances keep from seeking out and im -
plementing cost- saving measures in the hope 
of being granted relief by legislators at central 
government level. If the consolidation options 
available to local government prove insuffi -
cient, the onus will be on the respective state 
parliament to find a suitable solution.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2013, the issue volume in the 
German bond market stood at €134.3 billion in 
gross terms (previous month: €136.6 billion). 
After deducting redemptions and taking 
 account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own bonds, the volume of outstanding domes -
tic bonds rose by €4.3 billion. In addition, for -
eign debt securities worth €13.8 billion net 
were sold in the German market.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €14.0 
billion net in the reporting month. This was 
 attributable primarily to central government, 
which issued mainly two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze) worth €5.2 billion, ten- year 
Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €4.5 billion and 
five- year Federal notes (Bobls) worth €3.3 bil -
lion. In the month under review, the Federal 
state governments tapped the capital market 
for €2.3 billion net.In November, domestic enterprises cut their 
capital market debt by €1.3 billion in net terms. 
On balance, this involved solely bonds with a 
maturity of less than one year.
The outstanding amount of debt securities  issued 
by domestic credit institutions also  decreased in 
the reporting month, falling by €8.4 billion. There 
were net redemptions mainly of other bank debt 
securities (€4.9 billion), but public Pfandbriefe 
and debt securities issued by specialised credit in -
stitutions were also redeemed on balance (€1.8 
billion and €1.3 billion respectively).
Foreign investors were the main purchasers in 
November, adding €10.1 billion net worth of 
bonds to their portfolios. On balance, they 
 invested only in bonds issued by the public sec -
tor. German credit institutions acquired debt se -
curities –  for the most part foreign paper  – 
amounting to €7.9 billion in net terms. Domes -
tic non- banks purchased bonds with a net value 
of €0.3 billion, on balance solely foreign paper.Increase in

Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.2 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign equities in the German market 
dropped by €2.1 billion in the same period. On 
balance, shares were bought almost exclusively 
by foreign investors (€2.9 billion). German 
credit institutions added €0.1 billion net worth 
of shares to their portfolios, while domestic 
non- banks disposed of equity holdings with a 
value of €5.0 billion.
Mutual funds
In November, domestic mutual funds sold 
shares totalling €8.8 billion net in the German 
market (€5.8 billion in the previous month). On 
balance, fresh funds were injected solely into 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€11.7 billion), while mutual funds open 
to the general public redeemed shares to the 
value of €2.9 billion. Of the asset classes, bond- 
based funds in particular recorded substantial 
inflows (€7.2 billion). Open-  end real estate 
funds and share- based funds also placed new 
shares in the market (€1.5 billion and €1.3 bil -
lion respectively). Mixed securities- based funds, 
by contrast, recorded outflows totalling €2.2 
billion. Foreign mutual funds sold shares worth 
€0.9 billion in the German market in the report -
ing month. On balance, domestic non- banks 
were the main purchasers, adding €6.1 billion 
net of mutual fund shares to their portfolios. 
Foreign investors and resident credit institu -
tions acquired mutual fund shares to the tune 
of €2.8 billion and €0.7 billion net respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €21.6 billion in 
November 2013. The result was €2.8 billion up 
on the October level. This was due mainly to a 
larger surplus from invisibles, which comprise Hardly any

services, income and current transfers. A 
slightly higher trade surplus was another factor 
in the increased overall result.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in November the for -
eign trade surplus went up by €0.3 billion on 
the month to €18.1 billion. After adjustment 
for seasonal and calendar variations, it rose by 
€1.1 billion to €17.8 billion. The value of ex -
ports was up slightly on the previous month 
(+0.3%), whilst imports saw a sharp fall (-1.1%).
In November, Germany recorded a surplus of 
€6.3 billion in invisible trade, compared with 
€2.7 billion one month earlier. This reflected an 
improvement in all three sub- accounts. The in -
crease was mainly spurred by the turnaround in 
the services sub- account from a €0.8 billion 
deficit to a surplus of €1.8 billion, largely on 
account of the higher travel expenditure which 
is typical for this time of year. Moreover, net 
cross- border income rose by €0.5 billion to 
€7.2 billion while the deficit for current trans -
fers contracted by €0.4 billion to €2.6 billion.
Given the calmness of the financial markets, 
German cross- border portfolio investment 
 resulted in net capital imports of €1.4 billion in 
November. Portfolio investment abroad on the 
part of German investors (€14.3 billion) was 
offset by non- residents’ somewhat higher level 
of demand for German securities (€15.7 bil -
lion). In November, portfolio investors in Ger -
many focused their efforts on purchasing debt 
securities issued by non- residents (€13.8 bil -
lion), with a particular preference for euro-  
denominated longer- term financial instruments 
(€10.8 billion). In addition, they acquired mu -tual fund shares and disposed of foreign equi -
ties. For the most part, foreign investors bought 
German government bonds (€21.6 billion). 
They also added German equities (€2.9 billion) 
and mutual fund shares (€2.8 billion) to their 
portfolios while parting with money market 
paper (€10.1 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
in November (€10.3 billion). The fact that resi -
dent firms provided their foreign affiliates with 
€11.5 billion in funding –  mainly via longer-  
term financial loans – played a key role in this 
development. Foreign direct investment in Ger -
many stood at €1.2 billion in November.
In other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank 
 deposits and other assets, Germany saw net 
capital outflows of €16.7 billion in November. 
Financial activities by general government 
amounting to €8.8 billion contributed to this 
outcome. Here, the emphasis was on reducing 
short-  term liabilities vis-  à- vis foreign creditors. 
By contrast, transactions by enterprises and 
households resulted in net capital imports of 
€3.2 billion. The banking system experienced 
outflows of funds to the tune of €11.2 billion, 
largely in response to all other balance of pay -
ment transactions. While credit institutions’ net 
external assets rose by €12.9 billion in Novem -
ber, the net external position of the Bundes -
bank fell by €1.7 billion.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets increased

Overview
Background
In the years following the introduction of the 
euro, considerable macroeconomic imbalances 
accumulated in some euro- area member states. 
Although the type and extent vary from one 
country to the next, these imbalances have 
much in common. A sharp drop in price com -
petitiveness and a significant rise in current 
 account deficits were manifestations of these 
imbalances. In most cases, they were spurred 
by relatively strong growth of domestic de -
mand and, in several cases, a real- estate boom. 
The result was a constant diversion of factors 
of production towards domestically oriented 
sectors. As the macroeconomic growth, which 
took place in an environment of favourable 
 financing conditions, was accompanied by very 
strong credit growth, households’ and enter -
prises’ indebtedness rose. A large portion of 
the funding was raised through the individual 
banking systems, the balance sheets of which 
grew, in some cases considerably. On the 
whole, the sustainability of economic growth, 
the readiness of production structures for the 
future, the income outlook going forward and 
the recoverability of many assets were gravely 
overstated. The state of government finances 
was likewise assessed overoptimistically: public 
authorities benefited greatly from imbalances 
driven by domestic demand, and the additional 
latitude offered by lower funding costs was 
often not used for thorough consolidation; in -
stead, in many instances government spending 
expanded considerably.
Outbreak of the crisis and 
adjustment processes
The outbreak of the financial and economic cri -
sis in 2007-08 brought the expansion process 
of the previous years, which had generally not 
been sustainable, to an abrupt halt. The out -
look for growth and, in the same context, the creditworthiness of households, enterprises, 
 financial institutions and also general govern -
ment were fundamentally reassessed. The out -
break of the debt crisis in spring 2010 repre -
sented the most severe test of the resilience of 
the monetary union in its entire history. Not 
only the regulatory framework of monetary 
union, resting on the pillars of member states’ 
individual responsibility and the primacy of a 
stability- oriented monetary policy, but also the 
economies of many member states came under 
massive pressure: Greece, Ireland, Portugal 
and, most recently, Cyprus, needed consider -
able financial assistance from the other mem -
ber states and, in return, agreed to implement 
comprehensive macroeconomic adjustment 
programmes; Spain likewise received condi -
tional financial assistance to prop up its finan -
cial system.
In order to grant such conditional assistance, 
the ultimate goal of which was to avert threats 
to the financial stability of the euro area as a 
whole, bilateral aid for Greece was followed up 
initially by the creation of the European Finan -
cial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European 
 Financial Stabilisation mechanism (EFSM), 
which was then succeeded by the European 
Stability Mechanism (ESM). In addition, the 
Euro system once again stepped up the quantity 
and quality of the extensive non- standard 
measures it had already taken during the finan -
cial and economic crisis. The primary benefi -
ciaries were the countries particularly affected 
by the crisis and their banking systems, which 
received access to additional liquidity at favour -
able terms and conditions and at reduced col -
lateral requirements. The higher risk premiums 
demanded by the capital markets were there -
fore not fully passed through to borrowers. In 
the end, outflows or reduced inflows of private 
sector funds were made up for, and a gentler 
process of macroeconomic adjustment was 
made possible – for instance, with regard to Macroeconomic 
imbalances built up after the euro was intro-duced

the financing of still- extant current account 
deficits.
At the same time, the affected member states 
went to, at times, considerable lengths to assist 
in efforts to correct undesirable developments 
in their economies and to safeguard or restore 
confidence in enduring economic growth, 
 financial system stability and sustainable gov -
ernment finances. The necessary adjustment 
process taking place in the real economy, the 
financial sector and among governments is still 
in full swing. Various articles in this issue of the 
Monthly Report discuss individual elements of 
this process and identify key future challenges.
Those countries which were jolted by particu -
larly severe losses in confidence are now facing 
numerous difficult tasks, the urgency of which 
varies from one country to the next: reducing 
high current account deficits and high net 
 external debt, consolidating government 
budgets, restructuring financial systems and 
 reducing households’ and non- financial corpor -
ations’ debt in an orderly fashion. The perform -
ance of these economies needs to be boosted 
in order to restore sustainable growth which 
can create sufficient employment, and thereby 
drive the very high unemployment back down. 
This will require not only thoroughgoing re -
forms in labour and product markets, along 
with public sector agencies and legal systems, 
but also a reliable outlook that these measures 
will be decisively implemented and that the 
 authorities will stay the course with regard to 
reforms.
Tangible progress in the 
 adjustment process
In this light, a comparison between the current 
situation and development tendencies of the 
affected countries, on the one hand, with the 
situation at the onset of the crisis, on the other, 
shows that major gains have already been 
achieved, but that considerable further adjust -
ment remains necessary. Given the need for  reform which has come to light, it should come 
as no surprise that only part of the long road to 
reform has been travelled. Such adjustments 
will take time in order to become effective. 
Policymakers should not be expected to come 
up with panaceas capable of almost instantly 
eliminating the deep- rooted problems exposed 
by the crisis. This is especially true as the 
 affected countries in the monetary union no 
longer have the nominal exchange rate at their 
disposal as an adjustment instrument for coun -
try- specific problems and monetary policy 
makers need to maintain a stability orientation 
for the euro area as a whole.
On a positive initial note, the macroeconomic 
adjustment process has already made consider -
able progress in some countries: current ac -
count deficits have been largely eliminated, 
and most countries are now seeing their 
 exports rise perceptibly, along with sharply fall -
ing imports. This turnaround is probably due 
largely not only to weak economic activity and 
domestic demand, but also to the fact that 
most countries have seen improvements in 
their price and cost competitiveness, and 
 efforts to tap new foreign markets have been 
clearly on the rise. The economic outlook 
brightened somewhat over the course of the 
previous year, driven primarily by exports. Even 
the rise in unemployment, dramatic in some 
places, seems to be levelling off, yet at a worry -
ingly high level. Efforts, in some cases consider -
able, have been taken to stabilise the financial 
system, with additional burdens or losses in the 
banking system often being assumed by the 
government sector.
During this adjustment process, a raft of struc -
tural reforms have been tackled. These reforms 
were comparatively far- reaching on the labour 
market, especially with regard to job protec -
tion, unemployment benefits and collective 
bargaining law. Although it usually takes a 
 certain time- lag for the positive effects of the 
 reforms to materialise, initial signs are pos -
sibly  already emerging in those countries in Member states’

which the economic outlook has recently 
brightened.
By implementing consolidation measures on 
the revenue and expenditure sides, fiscal policy 
makers, too, have succeeded in reducing new 
borrowing, which had ballooned at the begin -
ning of the crisis; despite all the uncertainty 
 involved in factoring out cyclical influences, 
precisely in such periods of upheaval, the struc -
tural deficits, in particular, have gone back 
down significantly. The massive rise in govern -
ment debt, however, also indicates that gov -
ernments, partly with the help of assistance 
programmes, have made a considerable contri -
bution to stabilisation and, among other things, 
have propped up the financial system and off -
set its losses. The fact that Ireland successfully 
completed the assistance programme at the 
end of last year and that the programme 
 focused on Spain’s financial sector expired in 
January 2014 are testimony to the progress 
made in the adjustment process.
To sum up, in many of the countries which 
were hit hardest by the crisis, the conditions for 
sustainable growth are better than before the 
crisis as a result of the processes and reforms 
initiated, though this is currently being ob -
scured by the high unemployment resulting 
from the difficult adjustments. It must be em -
phasised, moreover, that investors are now 
more aware of the risks of their investments. 
Market responses to policy measures or entre -
preneurial decisions therefore have a more dis -
ciplining effect than prior to the crisis and can 
thus keep policymakers more firmly anchored 
to the path of reform upon which they had 
embarked.
Dealing with root causes 
 remains a challenge
Despite the progress made in addressing the 
causes of the crisis, a battery of challenges still 
lie ahead. The need for additional corrections 
to the balance sheets of the private and public sectors is weighing on the short- term eco -
nomic outlook. It is true that progress has been 
made in private-  sector deleveraging, and that 
such progress is becoming recognisable, espe -
cially considering that debt ratios were under -
stated before the crisis by the unsustainably 
high level of economic output, whereas in the 
current slump the exact opposite effect is 
 occurring. Historical experience of private-  
sector debt overhang, however, shows that not 
only do the adjustment processes for reducing 
overindebtedness generally dampen consump -
tion and investment, but that foot- dragging on 
balance sheet adjustment can also impair the 
necessary adjustment processes in the individ -
ual enterprises, stunt structural change and 
maintain an atmosphere of heightened uncer -
tainty about the future. This can have a per -
manently damaging effect on economic 
growth.
Despite the efforts taken and the deficit reduc -
tions achieved thus far beginning from around 
the year 2010, fiscal policy consolidation has 
frequently fallen short of the original plans and 
standards – to a major degree also because the 
underlying macroeconomic problems had been 
underestimated. There has been a further 
marked increase in the government debt ratios 
of the countries particularly affected by the cri -
sis; some of these ratios have now reached very 
high levels of well over 100% of nominal gross 
domestic product. On the whole, public fi -
nances therefore remain vulnerable to negative 
shocks. This is all the more so for two reasons. 
One is that initially precious time was squan -
dered following the outbreak of the financial 
and economic crisis: in many instances, de -
cisive reforms to fiscal and economic policy 
were not tackled until confidence in the sus -
tainability of public finances had already come 
under direct threat, and were then often too 
little, too late. Another is that, in some coun -
tries, implementation of adopted measures has 
been uneven, the reform process and 
confidence- building are being impeded by pol -
itical instability, or there has been mounting … budget def-

political pressure to depart from the path of 
consolidation and reform.
Although relatively comprehensive assistance 
and coordination mechanisms have been cre -
ated, the regulatory framework for monetary 
union continues to rest on the primacy of indi -
vidual national responsibility; no European fis -
cal union with extensive European powers of 
intervention in national economic and financial 
policy has been adopted. The problems there -
fore still have to be primarily resolved at the 
national level. The crisis is also, and above all, a 
debt crisis, and one of the central challenges is 
to reduce the high levels of private and public 
debt. General government, households, enter -
prises and economies as a whole need to be 
able once again to reliably service their debt 
obligations.
What this means for fiscal policy makers is not 
to stray from the path of consolidation. For one 
thing, the aforementioned extraordinarily ex -
pansionary fiscal policy at the beginning of the 
crisis and the, in some cases, drastic rise in gov -
ernment debt need to be taken into account. 
Although the deficit reduction now necessary 
may have a more contractionary effect than in 
normal times, no self- neutralising consolidation 
owing to short- term growth losses is to be 
 expected. Another factor to be noted is that 
the countries particularly affected by the crisis 
have either not yet restored lost confidence in 
the capital markets, or have only just now re -
stored confidence. It is of paramount import -
ance that government deficits be quickly re -
duced to European target levels so that a cer -
tain latitude is opened up for use as and when 
necessary if, for instance, national financial sys -
tems require further support. General govern -
ment’s ability and willingness to service its debt 
obligations is a key part of winning investors’ 
confidence and – particularly bearing the pro -
gramme countries in mind – the solidarity of 
the other member states, which have explicitly 
or implicitly assumed a considerable portion of 
the liabilities – in the Greek case, even the vast 
majority of liabilities.Efficient product and labour markets and com -
petitive economic structures are indispensable 
preconditions for household and corporate 
 deleveraging, as sufficient current income and 
earnings are necessary in order to service out -
standing debt. To further improve price-  based 
and non- price- based locational factors, the 
product and labour market reforms need to be 
continued, and the nature and scope of gov -
ernment activity also need to be subjected to a 
critical review with a view to creating efficient 
administrative structures and legal systems 
which support the economic process.
Moreover, clarity should be achieved as quickly 
as possible on how to deal with high private 
debt levels. It must be examined on a case- by- 
case basis whether existing debt can be repaid 
under realistic assumptions or, if not, whether 
it can be rolled over or, in extremis,  written 
off. On the one hand, it would be wrong to 
simply renounce the repayment of debt, as this 
would increase the incentive for misbehaviour, 
and  future credit relationships would involve 
large risk premiums. On the other hand, bad 
debt should be removed from the books as 
soon as possible, and it is the task of policy -
makers to adjust modalities which stand in the 
way of such cleansing; potential growth will be 
stunted if unsustainable economic structures 
are preserved and uncertainty as to where po -
tentially looming losses will strike is permitted 
to fester.
Such cleansing of bad debt or non- performing 
loans is likely to weigh on bank balance sheets, 
in particular. The decision to create a banking 
union represents an integration step which, in 
principle, is important and can make the insti -
tutional framework of monetary union more 
resilient to future crises. However, the prepara -
tory work for Europeanising banking supervi -
sion can also contribute to solving today’s 
problems: in the banking sector, the forthcom -
ing balance sheet assessment of those institu -
tions which will be subject to joint direct super -
vision in future is intended to provide greater 
clarity about the size of balance sheet impair -Solving prob-

ments and to help put banks’ balance sheets 
back on a sound and reliable footing. For this 
to succeed, the assessment needs to be con -
ducted according to uniformly high standards 
with conservative valuations, and any impair -
ments identified must be rectified quickly and 
sustainably – primarily by strengthening the 
capital base through own funds or funds ob -
tained in the capital market, alternatively by 
bailing in creditors, resorting to funding from 
the member state’s public sector in a pinch 
only after all other options have been ex -
hausted. Moreover, a successful balance sheet 
assessment is likely to make a key contribution 
to reducing the dependence of banks in the 
peripheral countries on Eurosystem refinancing 
and to thus reducing the risks in the central 
bank balances and in their mirror image, the 
TARGET2 balances.
However, avoiding dragging out the necessary 
balance sheet corrections does not mean im -
posing increased private- sector deleveraging in 
the individual countries across the board. Port -
folio adjustments, such as through debt re -
structuring or insolvency, ultimately redistribute 
wealth – within the household, enterprise and 
banking sectors, but also from one of these 
groups to another and, depending on the cir -
cumstances, away from general government or 
foreign creditors. The urgency of such adjust -
ments, their feasibility, where they have to be 
applied, in particular, or also their side- effects, 
vary from one country to the next. Above and 
beyond the incentive effects mentioned earlier, 
key restrictions of a speedy deleveraging pro -
cess include the robustness of public finances, 
potential contagion effects abroad if certain 
creditors had to swallow particularly severe 
losses, or the consequences with regard to the confidence of foreign investors and thus to the 
possibility of once again covering external 
funding requirements primarily through private 
capital inflows.
Although the single monetary policy is making 
a considerable contribution to combating the 
crisis – by supporting efforts to overcome the 
general macroeconomic malaise through its 
 expansionary orientation, given the low price 
pressures, and through its non- standard mon -
etary policy measures, from which the banking 
systems in the countries particularly affected by 
the crisis have derived particular benefit – it is 
not the job of European monetary policy, how -
ever, to ensure the solvency of national bank -
ing systems or governments, and it cannot take 
the place of the necessary adjustments in the 
real economy and balance sheet cleansing.
For the countries particularly affected by the 
crisis, it is ultimately about arranging their eco -
nomic and fiscal policy affairs in such a manner 
that they can meet the requirements of the 
monetary union and its shared, stability-  
oriented monetary policy once again under 
their own power and on a long- term basis. 
Each member state has to confront, on its 
own, the task of attaining such readiness; 
therefore, looking at the crisis countries’ need 
for adjustment also forces the other member 
states to “look in the mirror”. Although greater 
risk sensitivity among investors and the regula -
tory framework of monetary union, with its 
 reformed rulebook, can give important guid -
ance to policymakers, each and every member 
state is ultimately responsible for, and should 
have a vested interest in, doing what it takes to 
secure the stability and the success of the sin -

Real economic adjustment processes 
and reform measures
During the years prior to the global financial and economic crisis, considerable macroeconomic 
imbalances built up in several euro- area countries. In an environment of favourable financing 
conditions, domestic demand and gross domestic product saw, in most cases, strong growth, 
and factors of production were reallocated to domestically oriented sectors. This went hand in 
hand with a sharp deterioration in price competitiveness, considerable increases in current 
account deficits and a surge in private sector debt.
When the financial and economic crisis broke out in 2007-08, this process of expansion, which 
on the whole had not been sustainable, came to an abrupt end. The assessment of the macro -
economic outlook was heavily revised. The subsequent adjustment process has entailed a correc -
tion of the macroeconomic imbalances that had built up; it has, to an extent, been cushioned 
and protracted by extensive assistance programmes, and is still ongoing today. This process is 
indispensable in redressing the imbalances and laying the foundations for a return to sustainable 
growth. However, it has been constrained by the fact that the improvement in price competitive -
ness within a monetary union mainly has to be achieved through real depreciation based to a 
large degree on wage moderation and rationalisation. Moreover, the lack of sensitivity of the 
nominal euro exchange rate to country- specific developments limits the scope in a monetary 
union for a real devaluation of local currency debt through devaluation- induced price increases. 
Against this background, economic recovery is being hampered by the continued need to correct 
the balance sheets of the private and public sector and by uncertainty about the possibility of 
insolvencies.
Marked success has been achieved in unwinding the macroeconomic imbalances accumulated in 
the countries on the periphery of the euro area over the past few years. Current account deficits 
have contracted significantly or have even, in some of the countries hit particularly hard by the 
crisis, been turned into surpluses. Reforms, some of them extensive, have also got underway in 
the labour and product markets. Economy- wide unit labour costs have for the most part fallen 
substantially. There are now initial signs that the factors of production are being reallocated to 
sectors with a stronger export orientation, and the share accounted for by the previously bloated 
construction industry has shrunk significantly in many cases. This is consistent with the fact that 
the downward economic trend stopped during the course of 2013 and that the outlook has 
brightened in most of the periphery countries. The positive effects of structural reforms on growth 
are likely to become more clearly visible in the years ahead as the nascent economic recovery 
gathers pace. However, the reform process needs to be rigorously continued in order to support 
and advance the adjustments. This applies in particular to countries in which successes have been 
relatively slight so far. All in all, it is important to quickly restore confidence in the periphery coun -
tries as production locations and, by reanimating the largely still depressed investment activity, to 
create an effective growth model which will allow robust and sustainable income growth and 
new job opportunities.Deutsche Bundesbank

Developments in the real 
economy before the global 
financial crisis
The period from the start of stage three of 
European Economic and Monetary Union at 
the beginning of 1999 to the outbreak of the 
global financial and economic crisis was a 
phase of relatively robust growth for the euro 
area. From 1999 to 2007, real gross domestic 
product (GDP) advanced by an average of 2.3% 
per year, compared with -0.3% between 2008 
and 2013. And yet developments varied widely 
across the individual member countries in the 
years leading up to the crisis, too. Average 
growth rates ranged from 6.2% in Ireland 
to 1.6% and 1.5% in Germany and Italy re -
spectively. Moreover, inflation rates differed 
considerably. While the average inflation rate 
for the euro area as a whole stood at 2.1% per 
year between 1999 and 2007, the rates in Por -
tugal, Ireland, Spain and Greece ranged be -
tween 2.9% and 3.4% compared with only be -
tween 1.6% and 1.8% in Germany, Finland, 
Austria and France. At 2.3%, Italy’s inflation 
rate was somewhat above the euro- area aver -
age (see the table on page 21).
The large differences that existed in growth 
and inflation were accompanied by growing 
current account imbalances.1 Particularly in the 
periphery countries, high current account def -
icits built up in the years 2007-08, while not -
ably Germany and the Netherlands displayed 
rising surpluses prior to the crisis (see the table 
on page 22). Developments in most of the per -
iphery countries between 1999 and 2007 were 
driven by trade and services accounts. By con -
trast, the deficits in Greece and Portugal were 
already fairly high when they joined European 
Economic and Monetary Union (in 2001 and 
1999 respectively). One reason for this was 
that, in the years before, there had been a 
marked decline in net capital transfers from 
abroad; this was true of both public transfers 
(eg from the EU) and private transfers. The fur -
ther deterioration of the current accounts of 
both countries in the subsequent years was then closely related to the rise in net factor in -
come, inter alia  because of rising interest pay -
ments due to the increasing external debt. 
Overall, the reversal in factor income and trans -
fers accounted for three- quarters of the widen -
ing of Portugal’s current account balance by 
12½ percentage points between 1995 and 
2008; the share was only marginally smaller in 
Greece. Since transfer and factor income flows 
are between national income and domestic 
product, gross national income – ie the total 
income of residents – grew less strongly than 
GDP , which represents the total value of goods 
and services produced.
Substantial differences between euro- area 
countries existed, moreover, in developments 
in domestic demand, which grew markedly 
from as early as the mid-1990s –  ie before 
stage three of European Economic and Monet -
ary Union – in the periphery countries in par -
ticular. This growth was fuelled by the positive 
real interest rate shock and the boost to confi -
dence brought about by the new institutional 
framework, which promised better predictabil -
ity of monetary and fiscal policy. In these coun -
tries, the level of domestic demand clearly ex -
ceeded gross national income over several 
years, ultimately leading to the development of 
current account deficits and a sharp increase in 
external debt (see also the chart on page 68).
With regard to the components of domestic 
demand, the largest divergences in growth 
among the periphery countries were found in 
gross fixed capital formation – above all, in 
construction investment. The highest growth 
rates in expenditure on new buildings were re -
corded in Spain and Ireland, where construc -
tion prices likewise rose sharply. In both coun -
tries the macroeconomic investment ratios 
climbed appreciably to 30% of GDP in 2007.

trended only slightly downwards from the high 
level of 27% achieved in 1999.
In sectoral terms, the public sector contributed 
perceptibly to the external imbalances in Portu -
gal and Greece. By contrast, general govern -
ment in Spain and Ireland, having benefited 
from the strong macroeconomic expansion of 
the pre- crisis years, posted only slightly nega -
tive or even positive fiscal balances. The private 
non- financial sector (households and non-  
financial corporations) dragged down the 
macroeconomic fiscal balance in all four coun -
tries, however.2 Italy consistently recorded a 
negative general government budget deficit 
and a steadily declining surplus for the private 
non- financial sector.
The increase in domestic demand in the periph -
ery countries, which was relatively strong in 
most cases, led to a steady reallocation of the 
factors of production to domestically oriented 
sectors. Enterprises’ change of focus to the do -
mestic market was encouraged, moreover, by 
two factors. First, competitive pressure on the 
international markets intensified considerably 
owing to the growing integration of the Asian 
emerging market economies and the eastward 
enlargement of the EU. Second, the euro ap -
preciated in real effective terms over a number 
of years after 2001. The price and non- price 
competitiveness of manufacturers declined in 
the euro- area member countries in general, 
and in the periphery countries in particular 
given their less technology- intensive range of 
goods. Following this reallocation of resources, 
macroeconomic developments in the periphery 
countries grew more and more dependent on 
an increasingly debt- financed domestic de -
mand, notably in the construction industry. All 
in all, the periphery countries’ vulnerability to 
crises grew significantly in the years after the 
launch of European Economic and Monetary 
Union, fuelled by the mounting macroeco -
nomic imbalances, although this was initially 
scarcely reflected in the credit assessment of 
the financial markets.Euro- area unemployment fell rapidly until 2001 
as a result of the brisk economic activity, and 
either continued to fall or remained virtually 
constant in the years that followed. With the 
exception of Portugal, the unemployment rate 
in the periphery countries even trended down -
wards fairly steeply until 2007. The pace of 
wage growth accelerated, driven not least by 
the upbeat labour market situation. Because 
productivity saw only a modest increase, unit 
labour costs in all the periphery countries rose 
perceptibly. In Spain, the extensive recruitment 
of low- productivity construction workers was a 
major factor in this context. The deterioration 
of price competitiveness was especially clear 
vis- à- vis Germany, where unit labour costs had 
decreased by 0.1% per year on average be -
tween 1999 and 2007.
Growth prospects dim 
 abruptly after the onset of 
the financial crisis
The buoyant growth in domestic demand in 
the periphery countries came to an abrupt halt 
when the global financial and economic crisis 
broke out. Economic activity had already slack -
ened markedly after mid-2006 owing to the 
interest rate increases by the Eurosystem and 
the global rise in oil prices. This is particularly 
true of the construction sector in Spain and Ire -
land. However, as a result of the crisis of confi -
dence on the financial markets, which made 
investors much more risk averse from summer 
2007 onwards, households’ financing condi -
tions in particular deteriorated further and do -
mestic demand continued to slow markedly. 
Moreover, exports slumped in autumn 2008 
when the crisis escalated following the collapse 
of Lehman Brothers. Between spring 2008 and 
the second quarter of 2009, euro- area GDP 
dropped by a total of 5.9%. The decline in GDP 
was less pronounced in member countries in 
which imports, too, contracted very sharply; 
these included Spain and Portugal. While for -Sectoral fiscal

eign demand recovered during the course of 
2009 and exports picked up again in most 
euro- area countries, domestic demand in the 
periphery countries remained weak. This was 
due, first, to the rapid increase in unemploy -
ment and the associated income losses. 
Second, the assessment of growth prospects 
and of the sustainability of private and public 
sector debt for these countries (see pages 53 
to  65) was now much more pessimistic. A 
 return to the credit-  driven growth of the pre-   
 crisis years was therefore no longer possible.
What is more, part of the new capital stock 
created in the overheated domestic sectors had 
become obsolete. In practice, it is difficult to 
quantify this effect with any degree of reliability 
for individual countries. Nonetheless, it is clear 
that it will not be possible to use profitably 
some of the production capacity that was pre -
viously created on the basis of incorrect market 
signals. As was seen in Ireland and Spain, when 
a housing bubble bursts the misallocation of 
resources becomes particularly evident, eg in a 
large stock of unsold residential properties that 
will also remain unmarketable in the long term 
and a sharp rise in the number of bankrupt 
construction companies. However, excessive 
borrowing by households and governments 
purely for consumption purposes can likewise 
lead to misallocations. When domestic demand 
slackens and the level of costs remains un -
changed, certain plants can no longer be util -
ised as before. A further factor is that structural 
unemployment rises on account of workers’ 
limited regional or sectoral mobility and unsuit -
able skills profiles, among other factors. Over -
all, when the financial crisis began in 2007, 
putting an end to the extremely loose financing 
conditions, it became obvious that the level of 
potential output had been overestimated be -
fore the crisis. Potential growth, too, had to be 
reassessed; it will remain weak in the years 
ahead.
Adjustment pressure in the real economy inten -
sified as private capital inflows to the periphery 
countries dried up. The impact of the abrupt correction that would otherwise have occurred 
in Greece, Ireland and Portugal was cushioned 
by international assistance programmes in 2010 
and 2011 that were made conditional on ex -
tensive consolidation and reform. Italy and 
Spain, too, gradually introduced reform and 
consolidation measures, not least in order to 
signal to the financial markets that they were 
endeavouring to achieve a more sustainable 
growth model and sound public finances. The 
crisis escalated in Cyprus in 2012 after the hair -
cut on Greek government bonds had placed a 
heavy burden on Cyprus’s already stricken 
banking sector. An adjustment programme was 
launched for Cyprus, too, in 2013.
Owing to the escalation of the sovereign debt 
and banking crisis from 2010 onwards, the per -
iphery countries slipped back into recession 
after a brief, flat recovery, which Greece did not 
experience at all. The cumulative GDP loss be -
tween the beginning of 2008 and summer 
2013 came to 9.1% in Italy, 6.6% in Ireland, 
7.4% in Spain and 7.1% in Portugal (see the 
chart on page 25). The strongest declines were 
seen in Greece, where real GDP fell over a 
period of six years and recently stood at almost 
one quarter below its pre- crisis high. At the 
same time, unemployment in those countries 
rose dramatically, with most of them posting 
record levels during the course of 2013. A sub -
stantial share of unemployment has probably 
now become structurally entrenched, and 
structural reform will be indispensable in redu -
cing it again in a future cyclical recovery.
Real economic adjustment 
processes now underway
The adjustment process now underway in the 
periphery countries is designed, on the one 
hand, to reduce the macroeconomic imbal -
ances that have built up by lowering high cur -
rent account deficits, consolidating public 
 finances, restructuring the financial systems 
and reducing the debt of households and non- 
financial corporations. On the other hand, the The crisis causes

medium and long- term objective is to improve 
economic performance and foster sustainable 
growth. To achieve this, sweeping reforms of 
the labour and product markets in particular 
and of public administrations, as well as 
changes to the legal system, are essential.
The direct consequence of reducing macroeco -
nomic imbalances is that domestic demand in 
the periphery countries will – in absolute terms 
or as a percentage of GDP – be lower than be -
fore the crisis over an extended period of time. 
For instance, investment activity is being damp -
ened by often high overcapacity, balance sheet 
adjustments by enterprises and households as 
well as more cautious lending by banks. There 
is pressure to consolidate public investment if 
savings are not made elsewhere or taxes and 
levies increased. In the short run, cuts in gov -
ernment transfers and the public sector will 
curb households‘ real disposable  income, and 
therefore private consumption. In addition, the 
heavy job losses, which will be compensated for in the medium term at the earliest and the 
– for now – muted wage growth for employ -
ees in the non- financial business economy will 
dent income developments.
Against this background, it would appear ap -
propriate for the periphery countries to focus 
mainly on strengthening their export industry. 
The current account deficits of the periphery 
countries have already contracted markedly or 
have even turned into surpluses over the last 
two to three years. This development is largely 
attributable to the change in the balance of 
goods and services, which was clearly in posi -
tive territory in Ireland, Italy and Spain in 2012 
and in Portugal in the first half of 2013. The 
development of their bilateral current account 
balance with Germany in particular has been 
turned around.3 Moreover, lower interest pay -Domestic

ments as a result of the haircut in 2012 have 
made a significant contribution to Greece‘s 
lowering the external imbalance. The improve -
ment of the current account balance in Spain, 
Portugal and Ireland is attributable in large part 
to the sharp rise in exports, which experienced 
a distinct increase to non- euro- area markets in 
particular. However, despite a moderate, con -
stant upward trend, Italy has so far been un -
able to return to its pre- crisis level. Greek real 
exports have been stagnating for three years. 
By contrast, real imports trended downwards in 
the countries under review over almost the en -
tire period. A slight upward trend first took 
hold in several of the countries in the course of 
2013.
The correction of the current account balances 
is likely to be largely structural in nature and 
not cyclical. It is therefore unlikely that an eco -
nomic recovery would quickly give rise to the 
build- up of deficits on the scale seen before the 
crisis. Crucially, the reduction of imports is at -
tributable in part to a permanent reduction in 
the level of domestic demand, and the relative 
prices in the countries have shifted in favour of 
tradable goods. Another important factor is 
that the rise in exports has been achieved in a 
fairly difficult global setting with a relatively 
weak economic tailwind. However, price and 
non- price competitiveness will need to be 
strengthened further in order to generate 
strong export growth in the future, too, or to 
replace imports by domestic production. To this 
end, the conditions for investment in the trad -
able sector need to become more attractive. It 
will only be possible to exert relatively little in -
fluence on the costs of certain intermediate 
goods, notably energy, in the individual coun -
tries in the near future. Continued wage mod -
eration will therefore be crucial. Competitive -
ness can be partly improved through productiv -
ity gains; however, to be broad- based, these 
will have to result, not least, from successfully 
implemented structural reforms, which means 
that they will only become effective in the 
 medium term. In many cases, real wages will 
even have to fall markedly in order to reinte -grate, in particular, employees with a low level 
of education who before the crisis had rela -
tively well- paid jobs in construction or con -
struction- related services. Additionally, struc -
tural reforms are needed to heighten adaptabil -
ity to shocks so that the factors of production 
that are freed up can again be used fairly 
quickly in the most appropriate economic sec -
tors.
The current account adjustments in the periph -
ery countries in recent years reflect the signifi -
cant changes in the fiscal balances of their do -
mestic sectors. Viewed in combination, the fis -
cal balances of non- financial corporations and 
households responded quickly and strongly to 
the changes, while public sector deficits initially 
continued to increase sharply before shrinking 
only at a slow pace. Partly with the support of 
the assistance programmes, this has lessened 
the impact of the macroeconomic adjustment 
process, but has come at the cost of rapidly 
rising debt ratios (see pages 39 to 52).
The fact that economy- wide unit labour costs 
have fallen quite substantially in some periph -
ery countries over the last few years is also part 
of the considerable progress made in the ad -
justment process. This fall is partly a reflection 
of the sharp increase in average labour prod -
uctivity as job cuts have mostly taken place in 
sectors where cyclical excesses had previously 
made the recruitment of workers with com -
paratively low labour productivity worthwhile. 
Average labour productivity rose sharply over 
the four years from the second quarter of 
2008, especially in Spain and Ireland. By con -
trast, labour productivity in Italy fell in certain 
sectors during this period, which played a key 
role in pushing up national unit labour costs.
In Ireland, Greece, and more recently also Cy -
prus, there has also been a marked to steep 
decline in compensation per employee. In 
these countries, as well as other crisis coun -
tries, there have been cutbacks in the average 
compensation for public-  sector workers in the 
last few years. With the exception of Greece, Adjustment of

wage adjustment in the public sector has been 
higher than in the non- financial business econ -
omy, where any wage cuts so far have affected 
almost only new staff, while wage levels for 
existing employees have mostly been main -
tained or slightly increased.
Wage cuts in the public sector have helped to 
consolidate public finances. In addition, they 
are important from a macroeconomic perspec -
tive because a relative fall in public sector wage 
levels increases the incentive to look for jobs in 
the private sector and public sector wage de -
velopments can act as a signal for wage settle -
ments in other sectors. From a macroeconomic 
point of view, the crisis countries need a pro -
longed period of wage moderation to lower 
the employment threshold and help to reduce 
the high rate of unemployment through more 
employment- intensive growth.
In some periphery countries, initial signs that 
factors of production are being reallocated to 
sectors with a strong focus on exports have 
emerged in recent years. In Ireland, the con -
struction industry accounted for over half the 
decrease in aggregate employment; in Spain, 
Italy and Portugal, it accounted for around 
two- fifths. In industry, by contrast, either much 
fewer jobs have been cut or – as in Ireland – 
new jobs have recently been created. Real 
value added, in particular, already far exceeded 
its pre- crisis level in the export- intensive infor -
mation and communication sector in Spain and 
Ireland in 2012. In Ireland, other business-  
related services also showed substantial 
growth. Compared to its pre- crisis level, real 
value added in trade and tourism increased in 
Portugal and remained virtually unchanged in 
Spain.
Overall, it can be said that the macroeconomic 
adjustment process in most periphery countries 
has already made appreciable progress. The 
economic outlook in the periphery countries 
also brightened distinctly over the course of 
2013. For the first time in two years, Portugal 
and Spain recorded positive quarterly GDP growth rates in the second and third quarters 
respectively, while the sharp decline in Italy 
came to a halt during the third quarter. The 
economic situation also appears to be grad -
ually stabilising in Greece. During the second 
half of 2013, the unemployment rate in the 
periphery countries, which had risen to unpre -
cedented levels over a period of several years, 
either remained high or – as in Ireland and Por -
tugal – decreased slightly. In Ireland and Portu -
gal, employment levels have also risen again 
recently.
Improved price 
 competitiveness in the 
 periphery countries
Thanks to the productivity gains and wage cuts 
described above, some periphery countries 
have noticeably improved their price competi -
tiveness in recent years. Measured by the price 
competitiveness indicator based on the defla -
tors of total sales vis- à- vis a large group of 37 
countries, the increase since the second quar -
ter of 2008 has been between around 4% (Por -
tugal) and 9% (Ireland). As well as the progress 
made in domestic adjustments, the increased 
competitiveness on the world markets was due 
largely to the fact that, on balance, the euro 
depreciated considerably in several stages 
against the currencies of important trading 
partners after the US real estate crisis escalated 
into a global financial crisis during 2008 and 
the financial situation of some euro- area coun -
tries deteriorated dramatically during 2010. At 
the end of the year, the effective exchange rate 
of the euro was around 7% lower than its aver -
age during the second quarter of 2008.
The competitiveness indicator based on the 
unit labour cost of the total economy shows an 
even more positive overall picture than price-  
based indicators. Here, the improvement 
ranged from around 6% in Italy to 25% in Ire -
land. In the periphery countries, the reform and 
adjustment measures seem to have had a 
stronger impact on wages and productivity, Initial signs of a 
reallocation to sectors with a strong focus on exports

while prices in themselves have risen, at least 
temporarily, not least due to the considerable 
increases in indirect taxes, eg the VAT hikes in 
Greece and Spain. However, when interpreting 
the relatively strong improvement in unit labour 
cost- based competitiveness indicators, it should 
be borne in mind that these had deteriorated 
to a greater extent than price- based indicators 
before the crisis and only capture part of the 
macroeconomic costs.
Due to their close trade links, the development 
of prices and costs in relation to other euro-  
area countries has a major impact on the per -
iphery countries‘ competitiveness.4 Within the 
euro area, where competitiveness is no longer 
directly influenced by exchange rate move -
ments, Italy has, at most, only managed to sta -
bilise its competitive position in recent years. 
The other periphery countries, by contrast, 
have improved their price competitiveness vis-  
à- vis their euro- area trading partners since the 
second quarter of 2008.5Despite the progress made in restoring com -
petitiveness, it cannot be assumed that this 
process has already made sufficient headway. 
This is indicated by the mere fact that un -
employment levels currently remain high. A 
suitable benchmark is needed in order to draw 
valid conclusions about the remaining need for 
adjustment.6 Looking at the long- term average 
of the competitiveness indicator based on the 
deflators of total sales, and taking into consid -
eration the estimation uncertainty, the Irish 
economy‘s competitive position is practically 
neutral, while the competitive positions of the 
other periphery countries are less favourable 
across the board.7 Further adjustments of 
around 10% to 15% in relative prices would be 
needed in these countries. The need for prod -
uct and labour market reforms and the pres -
sure to change the focus of business in the cor -
porate sector thus remain high.
While the long- term average used as a refer -
ence value for assessing the competitive pos -
ition is derived from the relative purchasing 
power parity, which assumes a constant refer -
ence value for the real exchange rate, the prod -
uctivity approach takes account of the fact 
that, during the recovery process, productivity 
in each of the observed counties tends to in -
crease and therefore affects the reference

value.8 The stronger a country‘s productivity 
growth vis- à- vis its trading partners, the more 
sharply this country‘s relative price level can rise 
without causing a reduction in its price compe -
tiveness. Although the reference values are cal -
culated in very different ways, both methods 
mostly produce fairly similar results when as -
sessing the periphery countries‘ current com -
petitive position. The productivity approach 
also indicates that, if at all, Ireland has only 
minor remaining adjustment needs, while these 
are still quite high in most of the other periph -
ery countries. It is only for Spain that the prod -
uctivity approach – unlike the long-  term aver -
age of the competitiveness indicator – indicates 
a neutral to favourable competitive position.
The current level of progress 
in structural reforms
The periphery countries have initiated a num -
ber of reforms in the last three years. These re -
forms have focused on labour and product 
markets, financial markets, public finances, 
public authorities and judicial systems. The aim 
was, and still is, to support the reduction of 
macroeconomic imbalances, strengthen expan -
sionary forces in these countries and generate 
new growth potential. A further objective is to 
prevent high cyclical adjustment costs on the 
labour market in future, for instance by enab -
ling labour costs and working hours to respond 
more flexibly to changes to orders received, for 
example through short- time working arrange -
ments. Empirical studies show that structural 
reforms that generally aim to change the regu -
latory framework and that reduce impediments 
to growth have positive long- term effects on 
growth and employment.9 Studies also indicate 
that some reforms also have a positive me -
dium- term impact (see box on pages 30 to 32).
In addition to generous wage replacement pay -
ments, rigid wage bargaining systems and a 
low retirement age, strict employment protec -
tion regulations in particular prevent the labour 
market from functioning efficiently. This is why, in some euro- area countries, notice periods 
have been significantly shortened (Greece, 
Spain) and severance payments for individual 
redundancies have been capped (Greece, Por -
tugal, Spain, Italy). Collective dismissals have 
been made easier by relaxing the regulatory re -
quirements (Greece), by removing the need for 
government approval (Spain) and by speeding 
up the redundancy process (Spain, Portugal). In 
addition, the legal proceedings that often fol -
low redundancies and increase redundancy 
costs have been simplified (Greece, Spain, 
Italy). According to the OECD indicators for the 
strictness of employment protection legislation, 
the crisis countries have made noticeable pro -
gress in this area over the last few years (see 
chart on page 33).
The reforms in Spain and Italy were also in -
tended to reduce labour market segmentation 
so as to prevent workers on temporary con -
tracts from having to bear the brunt of the ad -
justment during the economic downturn. In 
addition to the above-  mentioned reduction in 
severance payments for workers on permanent 
contracts, stricter regulation has been intro -
duced for temporary employment contracts 
(Spain, Italy), internships and service contracts 
(Italy). Spanish labour law now provides for a 
new, permanent type of contract with a longer 
probationary period and severance pay that 
only increases gradually. It also allows employ -
ers to make dismissals on economic grounds. 
In Greece, by contrast, regulation on the use 
and extension of temporary employment con -
tracts has largely been relaxed.Aims of struc-

The empirical relationship between structural reforms and 
labour market variables
The question of whether structural reforms 
in the past were accompanied by progress 
in the labour market is analysed below for 
the period from 1980 to 2012. More specif-
ically, it is examined whether there are any 
empirical correlations within the fi  rst fi  ve years following the implementation of 
these reforms.1 The OECD provides a variety 
of structural variables for the largest 11 of 
the 18 euro- area economies, which can be used to measure reforms on the labour 
market.2 These include
– the level of unemployment benefi  ts for 
the long- term unemployed,
– the strictness of employment protection,
– the level of expenditure on labour mar-
ket policy measures,
– the retirement age.
In the case of major year- on- year changes, 
it is assumed that a reform was imple-mented. This makes it possible to identify 
structural reforms that could be correlated 
with rising employment, declining un-employment or higher GDP growth in the 
years following implementation.
A glance at the reform indicators shows that, in certain areas, changes took place 
quite rarely – in the case of benefi  ts for the 
long- term unemployed, for example  – 
whereas other segments of the labour mar-ket, such as employment protection legisla-
tion, were reformed rather frequently. In the euro area, employment protection for 
temporary workers, in particular, has been 
reduced considerably over the past few decades, whereas employment protection for workers with permanent contracts has been subject to noticeably fewer changes 
(see adjacent chart). In the majority of these 
1 The relationships identifi  ed here cannot be inter-
preted as causal since a number of different factors are 
superimposed on each other and it is diffi   cult to isolate the impact of a specifi  c structural reform.
2 The majority of the indicators used are described 
inter alia in OECD (2013), Economic Policy Reforms 
2013: Going for Growth, OECD Publishing, Chapter 4: 
Structural policy indicators. However, many of these indicators do not stretch as far as the current end; what is therefore measured more are general correl-ations of structural reforms with the situation in the 
labour market (or GDP growth) and not the impact of structural reforms in the current euro- area crisis.Employment protection*

euro- area countries, funding for labour 
market policy measures was increased on several occasions during the period under review, whereas the retirement age was raised only in around half of these coun-
tries.
A descriptive analysis shows that there 
would appear to be a correlation between 
the implementation of a reform and the 
corresponding variables on the labour mar-
ket that were targeted by the reform. For 
example, in the years following the reduc-
tion in benefi  ts for the long- term un-employed, the youth unemployment rate was considerably lower than its level prior 
to the reform. As it may nevertheless be as-
sumed that various other factors also had 
an impact in this instance and that the de-
cline was not due solely to the impact of 
the reform, the relationship is estimated in 
an econometric model based on Bouis et al 
(2012).3 This makes it possible to eliminate 
the other factors from the calculation. Here, the relevant variable is a dummy for whether 
or not a country has implemented a struc-
tural reform in a given year. The correlation 
of the individual reforms to the change in 
employment, unemployment or the rise in 
GDP is determined in individual regressions. The following equation is estimated for 
each year k = 1, 2, 3, 4  and 5 as well as for 
each reform:
Yi,t+k – Yi,t =  αk + βkYi,t-1 + θk reformi,t 
+ λk recessioni,t + бk rxri,t 
+ ηk interesti,t + νi + γt + εi,k,t ,
where Y denotes the dependent variable 
(employment rate, unemployment rate, 
GDP growth), reform  is the dummy variable 
for a major reform step, recession  is a 
dummy variable for a recession (ie a nega-
tive year- on- year growth rate), rxr is the 
real exchange rate (on the basis of the de-fl  ators of total sales), 
interest  is the interest 
rate and v and y are the dummy variables 
for the countries and the years respectively.4
It can be seen that a reduction in benefi  ts 
for the long- term unemployed was accom-
panied by declining unemployment, with youth unemployment showing an even

there is an additional control for GDP growth in the year of the reform in order to take account of the

sharper fall (see chart above). In those 
countries where there were signifi  cant cut-
backs in benefi  ts for the long- term un-
employed, the unemployment rate fell by up to 3.3 percentage points in the subse-
quent fi  ve- year period; in the case of youth 
unemployment, this rate dropped by as much as 5.4 percentage points below its 
level in the year of the reform.
By contrast, in the case of lower unemploy-
ment benefi  t payments for the short- term 
unemployed, no empirical relationship was 
found with the rate of unemployment. The 
strongest correlation is that between lower 
employment protection for temporary workers and a rise in the overall employ-ment rate, especially in the case of older 
workers. Furthermore, there exists a nega-
tive correlation with unemployment. This, however, should not imply the policy rec-ommendation for crisis countries with an already strongly segmented labour market to further reduce the level of employment 
protection for temporary workers. In the 
past, the lower level of employment protec-
tion for temporary workers led to this cat-
egory having to make the greatest adjust-ment effort in the crisis. Instead, the fi  nd-
ings should be interpreted to mean that a 
reduction in employment protection – which primarily affected temporary em-
ployees in the period under review – is cor-
related with a rise in employment for this 
category, too.
In addition to employment protection, higher expenditure on getting individuals 
who are diffi   cult to place (back) into the la-bour market is correlated, at best, with ris-
ing employment. Countries with increased 
spending (measured by GDP) had signifi  -cantly higher employment from the third year following implementation of the re-form compared with countries without 
such a programme (see adjacent chart). Fur-
thermore, there is also a correlation with declining youth unemployment. For ex-ample, within fi  ve years of the increase in 
expenditure, the youth unemployment rate in these countries fell 2.4 percentage points 
more than in the countries which did not 
implement such a reform.
Even though, for methodological reasons, the present analysis can demonstrate only empirical correlations between structural 
reforms and advances in the labour market, 
and not a causal relationship, looking at past reforms can at least provide valuable 
clues about the chances of success of com-
parable structural reforms which have al-
ready been implemented or are planned in the crisis countries.Employment and youth unemployment

Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have decided 
to increase the statutory retirement age grad -
ually. Furthermore, early retirement options 
have been restricted in Spain. Pension pay -
ments have also been reduced in Greece. These 
reforms are likely to raise the effective retire -
ment age, thereby increasing the potential la -
bour force. Unemployment benefits have been 
reduced by cutting payments across the board 
(Greece, Spain), introducing caps (Portugal) 
and shortening the entitlement period (Greece, 
Ireland, Portugal, Italy). In addition, financial in -
centives to take up work have been created in 
Portugal. Italy has introduced a universal un -
employment insurance scheme which reduces 
the income risks associated with the former 
sector or company- based system and which is 
intended to encourage mobility between sec -
tors and companies. In Greece, extending the 
group of persons entitled to pension benefits 
to the self- employed has also made it easier to 
change from employee status to self-  
employment, and vice versa.10
Product market reforms are intended to help 
reduce potential inefficiencies caused by a lack 
of competition, growth- inhibiting regulations, 
government intervention, excessive bureau -
cracy or access restrictions in order to boost 
productivity growth, encourage investment 
and create jobs. Reform efforts of this kind in 
the periphery countries have been aimed pri -
marily at relaxing the eligibility criteria for inde -
pendent professions, reducing the bureaucracy 
involved in setting up new businesses or inten -
sifying competition in network industries. The 
Doing Business report published by the World 
Bank can be used to evaluate the progress 
made with the reforms in these areas. The re -
port assesses the general business environment 
based, for example, on the cost and bureau -
cracy involved in starting a business, legal clar -
ity, getting credit and the cost and time needed 
to resolve insolvency. According to Doing Busi -
ness 2014, the business environment in the 
southern periphery countries has improved no -
ticeably in the last few years; Ireland has al -
ready been rated more favourably. Between 2009 and 2013, Portugal, Italy and Spain rose 
17, 13 and 10 places up the list respectively. 
Greece moved up 37 places. However, despite 
the progress achieved, Italy and Greece remain 
very low in the rankings in terms of enforcing 
contracts (103rd and 98th out of 189 coun -
tries). Overall, further efforts appear necessary 
in this area to create a reliable legal environ -
ment for companies.
Reform path must be 
 maintained consistently
All in all, the crisis countries have made consid -
erable reform efforts over the past few years.

views that this is the case in the programme Reforms to

The macroeconomic impact of labour market reforms 
in Germany
About 15 years ago, the fact that un-
employment was entrenched at a high level 
showed that the institutional framework of the German labour market was no longer in keeping with the times. Disincentives damp-
ened unemployed persons’ willingness to take up work and their search intensity when looking for a new job. Firms were 
subject to considerable strains due to costs and suffered from a lack of fl  exibility in the deployment of labour. After the start of the 
new millennium, economic output stag-nated for several years; along with an op-
pressively high level of unemployment, this 
placed a heavy burden on public fi  nances 
and the social security systems. During this 
period, enterprises and trade unions were 
already exploring new avenues in terms of 
their collective working agreements.1 Above 
all, along with measures for fi  scal consoli-
dation and the adjustment of the social se-
curity systems, the governing coalition at the time implemented a comprehensive 
multi- stage reform of labour market policy 
and social policy. This included reducing 
both the amount of unemployment benefi  t and the maximum period of entitlement to 
it, a reorientation of active labour market 
policy, raising the de facto retirement age, 
simplifi  ed regulations for temporary work, 
and the restructuring of the Federal Labour Offi   ce in order to be more effective in sup-
porting the unemployed and getting them 
back into work in future.
From the present- day perspective, these  reform measures are generally rated as a 
success, since they led to a net rise in em-
ployment and a signifi  cant decline in un-
employment. After they entered into force, 
it was initially all but impossible to identify 
the positive effects of the new regulations from a macroeconomic perspective and, as a result, they were the subject of some dis-
pute. A number of side effects, which mainly dampened domestic economic ac-
tivity, countered the growth- promoting 
stimuli of the reforms. From 2006 onwards, 
however, the cyclical recovery led into a 
sharp upswing under the positive infl  uence 
of the global economic setting and saw a perceptible rise in employment, principally affecting jobs that are subject to social  security contributions. There was also a 
notable increase in the labour force partici-
pation of older persons. Even so, at this 
time it was not an easy matter to separate 
the permanent part of the labour market pick- up from the cyclical component. The 
improvement in the structural condition of 
the labour market became apparent chiefl  y 
in the ensuing period. The abrupt and 
marked recession in 2008-09 had no more 
than a moderate impact on employment 
and unemployment, for example. Although 
workers had been hoarded on a major 
scale, the subsequent economic upturn saw 
both employment and unemployment rap-
idly returning to their earlier trend growth paths. The fact that the recession did not necessitate any major structural adjust-
ments was an advantage in this context.
The success of the labour market reforms, 
which included improving job placement 
for the unemployed and making greater ef-forts to fi  nd a job, can be illustrated by the 
Beveridge curve. This is a graphical repre-sentation of the relationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy

changed underlying structural conditions. A 
fall in unemployment during expansionary 
periods is usually accompanied by a height-
ened level of vacancies in the economy as a whole and causes the curve to slope down-wards. Long- term improvements in the job 
placement process and greater search ef-
forts by unemployed persons push the Bev-
eridge curve towards its origin and lower the structural unemployment rate. Follow-ing the amalgamation of unemployment 
assistance and social assistance for persons 
of working age to form unemployment benefi  t II (Hartz IV) at the beginning of 2005, statistical effects initially led to the Beveridge curve shifting outwards, since certain persons who had not previously been counted as part of the labour force were now classifi  ed as unemployed. By 
contrast, there was a marked decline in un-
employment in 2007-08, while, as ex-
pected, the number of advertised vacancies dropped. As a result, the Beveridge curve is now identifi  ably nearer to its origin than in 
the period prior to the labour market re-
forms.
The notable increase in the transition rate from unemployment to employment be-
tween 2006 and 2010 indicates that the fall 
in the unemployment rate was due princi-
pally to the more effi   cient operation of job 
placement processes in the labour market and the fact that unemployed persons 
stepped up their efforts to fi  nd work. This 
can be confi  rmed by simulations. For this 
purpose, the structural unemployment rate, which results from the labour market fl  ows 
in steady state, is calculated for the hypo-
thetical case excluding the effects of the 
 labour market reforms. If the transition rate 
from unemployment to employment since 
2005 had remained at the same low level 
as before the Hartz reforms, the structural 
unemployment rate would not have moder-ated substantially by 2010. It would have 
been virtually just as high in 2012 as in the 
middle of the past decade.2 Similar studies 
based on detailed models and using more 
differentiated datasets largely confi  rm the 
results of the calculations presented here.3
The labour market reforms also included 
a  reduction of unemployment benefi  ts. 
2 The transition rate from unemployment to employ-
ment in the partial analytical model calculations also 
comprises unemployed persons exiting the labour force into inactivity, since it is not possible to isolate 
the latter in the statistics. The increase in labour force 
participation in the underlying period does suggest, however, that the results are largely due to un-
employed persons taking up work.3 See S Klinger and E Weber, 2012, Decomposing Bev-eridge curve dynamics by correlated unobserved com-

 According to traditional labour market 
models, lower transfer income is likely to 
tend to lead to unemployed persons step-
ping up their search efforts and a fall in  unemployment. These effects have been 
demonstrated in quantitative studies for the 
German labour market.4 Furthermore, dis-
tribution effects are to be taken into consid-eration. After the reforms, some categories of unemployed persons received higher un-
employment benefi  ts or took up work again, whereas others who were out of work suffered losses. Lower net expend-iture on unemployment benefi  ts, taken in 
isolation, is likely to have reduced the bur-
den of taxes and social contributions and, 
in purely mathematical terms, increased the 
net income of those in work.5 Furthermore, 
welfare losses occurred among persons in 
work, since the reforms meant that they have to forgo state- organised insurance 
benefi  ts in the event of a prolonged period 
of unemployment.6 Any assessment of this change in the institutional framework is 
subjective; from the perspective of the indi-
vidual user, it depends, for example, on variables which are diffi   cult to determine 
empirically, such as the degree of risk aver-
sion or perhaps the disinclination to be  reliant on the basic allowance system  provided by the state. Also, determining macroeconomic welfare effects is made 
more diffi   cult by the fact that a weighting 
of the specifi  c profi  t and loss items has to 
be made.
Additionally, it should be noted that, des-pite the conspicuous successes of the la-bour market reforms in the past decade, 
not all the problems on the German labour 
market have been eliminated. Seen in that 
light, there is still a need for action, say, 
with regard to the still very high level of un-
employment among the low- skilled in par-
ticular. Even so, there is no doubt that the 
reforms were an essential condition for the 
improved resilience of the German labour 
market.

countries Ireland11, Portugal12 and Cyprus13. 
The third programme review at the beginning 
of July also confirmed, with a few caveats, that 
Greece14 is on the right track. However, the 
fourth review could not be completed because 
there are currently substantial deficits in the 
programme implementation.
In general, it should be remembered that the 
positive effects of the reforms are not immedi -
ate, but will only become apparent over the 
course of time. They are also currently over -
shadowed by the ongoing macroeconomic ad -
justment process and the accompanying weak -
ness in domestic demand. In addition, certain 
reforms, such as the relaxation of employment 
protection legislation, may make the symptoms 
of the crisis more visible in the short to medium 
term, increasing political opposition to their im -
plementation.
Nevertheless, the periphery countries must re -
main on this reform path. It should not be for -
gotten that the macroeconomic developments 
in the periphery countries in the run- up to the 
crisis were unsustainable. The crisis has led to 
sharp, painful adjustments because the credit-  
based growth model could no longer be fi -
nanced. Financial aid, especially from the other member states, and the Eurosystem‘s monetary 
policy have both cushioned the impact of the 
adjustment process, but it is not yet complete 
and has created high levels of unemployment. 
Overall, thanks to the reform efforts made so 
far, the underlying conditions in most of the 
periphery countries are already significantly 
better than before the crisis. The resulting posi -
tive growth effects are likely to become 
stronger in the next few years in the wake of 
the nascent economic recovery. It is especially 
important to improve the locational conditions 
for the production of tradable goods in order 
to ensure both an upturn and a sustainable 
current account position. This must also involve 
safeguarding confidence in a politically stable 
framework that lays solid foundations for a sus -
tainable economic policy in the future.

Public finances:  
consolidation following crisis of confidence
Following the onset of the financial and economic crisis, public finances in the states of European 
monetary union deteriorated dramatically, and for 2009, almost all member states ran an exces -
sive deficit. The about-turn was particularly pronounced in countries that had previously experi -
enced macroeconomic or financial exaggerations. While these imbalances had a positive impact 
on public finances before the crisis hit, their inevitable correction drove government deficits and 
debt up sharply. Tax revenues fell, while labour market spending rose. In many countries, eco -
nomic stimulus programmes were a further drain on the public coffers. In addition, large amounts 
of public funds were used to support the financial markets in some instances, which equates to a 
transfer of losses and debt from the private to the government sector.
The radically changed economic and fiscal prospects as well as the insight that considerable 
imbalances had built up previously, together with heightened political uncertainty in some coun -
tries, resulted in a reassessment of the risk associated with lending to individual sovereigns. In 
several countries, doubts about the government’s ability and willingness to pay, and concomi -
tantly risk premiums on government bond yields, grew so much that these states resorted to 
assistance under fiscal and macroeconomic adjustment programmes or took steps to support 
banks.
From 2010 onwards, most of the countries hit hardest by the crisis took measures to bring down 
soaring government deficit ratios. However, the improvement was frequently less than originally 
targeted, and the agreed plans and requirements were loosened – in some cases repeatedly. One 
problem was that the underlying macroeconomic structural problems, and thus the extent of the 
adjustments needed, were obviously underestimated. Overall, government debt ratios have con -
tinued to rise noticeably up until recently and have reached very high levels in most instances. 
Further consolidation is needed, and public finances remain vulnerable to negative shocks. In 
addition, the ongoing fiscal uncertainty threatens to depress overall development.
Sound public finances in the member states are a prerequisite for smooth economic growth in the 
monetary union. They ensure fiscal manoeuvrability, promote sustained economic growth and 
high employment, and help stabilise the financial market. They thus make it easier for monetary 
policy to ensure price stability in the medium and long term. Those countries whose public 
finances are still highly vulnerable to negative shocks especially must continue to press ahead 
with consolidation, even as the macroeconomic adjustment process continues.Deutsche Bundesbank

Divergent developments in 
the countries worst hit by 
the crisis
Public finances have developed very differently 
in the individual member states. However, 
there are some similarities. For instance, one 
group of the countries particularly badly af -
fected by the crisis discussed in this article 
(Spain, Ireland and Cyprus) exhibited relatively 
sound public finances before the onset of the 
financial and economic crisis as measured by 
conventional indicators (general government 
balance, structural balance1 and debt ratio). 
This was mainly because macroeconomic and 
financial imbalances, some of them connected 
to an overheated property market, had tem -
porarily caused a sharp expansion in domestic 
demand and consequently boosted public 
 finances. Rapid wage growth and strong pri -
vate consumption were reflected in income 
and consumption tax revenues. Unexpected 
and exceptional income was, moreover, gener -
ated in connection with large- scale real estate 
transactions and rising asset prices. In some in -
stances, government revenues grew much 
stronger than would have been expected given 
developments in nominal gross domestic prod -
uct (GDP) and in view of legislative changes. 
General government spending was also ex -
panded sharply. However, expenditure ratios 
initially changed very little given the rapidly ris -
ing GDP (in the denominator). Overall, budget 
surpluses were generated, and the debt ratio 
was usually well below the 60% reference 
value.
With the onset of the financial and economic 
crisis, public finances in these countries deteri -
orated abruptly, however. The exceptional add -
itional revenue evaporated, and the economic 
correction meant that the “regular” tax base 
was also much more unfavourable than before. 
In addition, the estimated level of structurally 
neutral expenditure growth had to be cor -
rected downwards as potential growth proved 
lower than originally predicted. With the onset 
of the crisis, several countries launched eco -nomic stimulus programmes, and the structural 
expenditure ratio continued to rise, in part be -
cause expenditure growth remained high, in 
some instances – not least because structural 
factors drove up spending on social benefits. 
The banking sector, which was also affected by 
the real estate crisis, suffered large- scale losses. 
Consequently, governments mobilised consid -
erable funds to support banks. With hindsight, 
it was evident that the macroeconomic imbal -
ances had created considerable risks for public 
finances. As the correction started, the situ -
ation of, and outlook for, public finances were 
fundamentally reassessed, and government 
debt rose very rapidly. Nonetheless, the previ -
ous budget surpluses and low debt levels 
meant that there was initially considerable fis -
cal leeway, and these countries were able to 
absorb at least a large part of the burden aris -
ing from the shock themselves.
By contrast, public finances in a second group 
of countries (Greece, Portugal, Italy) were far 
more difficult even before the onset of the fi -
nancial and economic crisis, with Portugal and 
Italy experiencing weaker overall economic 
growth before 2008 than the first group (see 
the chart on page 25). Conditions for public fi -
nances were relatively favourable in these 
countries after they joined the monetary union, 
which was reflected, in particular, in a clear 
drop in the average interest paid on govern -
ment debt and, in some instances, in relatively 
strong wage and consumption growth. How -
ever, the authorities did not take advantage of 
these good conditions to rapidly bring about 
structurally balanced budgets and push ahead Before the crisis, 
some of the worst hit coun-tries had sound fiscal metrics but macroeconomic imbalances …

1 The structural balance is the general government balance 
adjusted for the impact of cyclical factors on government 
revenues and expenditure and adjusted for temporary 
measures. We use the structural balances reported by the 
European Commission here. These are, however, observed 
in relation to potential output as calculated by the Com -
mission – not in relation to GDP as in the Commission’s 
calculations – in order to eliminate cyclical influences from 
the denominator of the ratios observed. For more on how 
adjusted revenue and expenditure ratios are calculated, see 
the chart on p 44. The structural and cyclically adjusted 
budgetary figures are frequently subject to revisions, par -
ticularly in relation to the recent past, as the output gap is 
often difficult to estimate in real time. See also p 43.Deutsche Bundesbank

with reducing the in some cases very high debt 
ratios. Greece is a case apart, particularly as the 
desolate public finances were long masked by 
flawed statistics. Once the crisis hit, it became 
evident that public finances in Greece were out 
of control, and markets lost confidence. As in 
the other group of countries, spending mo -
mentum initially remained high in most coun -
tries in this group. In Portugal and Italy, public 
finances deteriorated less during the crisis than 
in the countries of the first group, mainly be -
cause the previous exaggerations – particularly 
on the real estate market – were far less pro -
nounced, and the unexpected revenue shortfall 
was consequently lower. Moreover, because the situation before the crisis was unfavour -
able, economic stimulus programmes had been 
employed fairly sparingly especially in Italy.
Loss of confidence and 
start of consolidation
It quickly became clear that the rapid and sharp 
expansion of deficit and debt levels in several 
countries threatened, if unchecked, to result in 
a serious loss of confidence in the sustainability 
of public finances, with considerable negative 
consequences. Accordingly, most member 
states started fiscal consolidation from 2010 Consolidation 
started in 2010Key public finance metrics

onwards. Nonetheless, there were growing 
doubts as to the ability and willingness of the 
countries hit hardest by the crisis to meet their 
obligations, and risk premiums on the interest 
rates payable on their government debt rose 
sharply. Greece was the first euro- area member 
state to be forced to resort to financial assis -
tance in May 2010. The low- interest assistance 
loans alleviated the adjustment process. At the 
same time, far- reaching consolidation and eco -
nomic reforms were agreed for the following 
years in order nonetheless to make progress on 
tackling the imbalance. At the end of 2010, a 
similar programme was agreed for Ireland, with 
Portugal following in the spring of 2011 and 
Cyprus in the spring of 2013. A financial assis -
tance programme was agreed with Spain in 
mid-2012, albeit only for the financial sector. 
The EU and euro area created tailor-  made aid 
funds to finance these programmes: the Euro -
pean Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the Euro -
pean Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) 
and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).2 Italy also experienced significantly higher mar -
ket pressure and high risk premiums. The Euro -
system’s outright monetary transactions (OMTs) 
reduced this market pressure, especially for the 
programme countries and Italy.
The amount of consolidation achieved since 
2010 varies considerably among the countries 
under observation. In the period from 2010 
to 2013, it was particularly large in Greece 
(4 percentage points) according to European 
Commission data (as measured by the average 
annual improvement in the structural deficit 
ratio), with some of it (½ percentage point) the 
result of declining interest expenditure thanks 
to subsidised assistance loans and the debt re -
structuring for private creditors in 2012. How -
ever, the preceding deterioration and difficul -
ties were particularly severe there, and the situ -
ation remains fragile. Portugal, Spain and, to a 
lesser extent, Italy achieved a much smaller, but 
nonetheless perceptible, consolidation, with an 
average annual improvement of about 1 per -
centage point. In Ireland and especially Cyprus, 
the average annual adjustment was only 
around ½ percentage point in structural terms, 
the minimum improvement specified in the 
European fiscal rules for countries in excessive 
deficit procedures. The timeline for consolida -
tion varies from country to country, with most 
of it having been achieved in 2012.
Overall, rising interest expenditure has been a 
drain on the public coffers of the countries hit 
especially hard by the crisis. Here, the decisive 
factor is not the average interest payable on 
government debt, which is at a historic low. 
The increase in the volume of debt is key. All 
countries have seen their debt levels soar since Average im-

tions.1 In connection with measures to support financial insti-
tutions, various factors can influence the deficit and/or debt ra-
tio. Guarantee fees or dividends on shares may create reven-
ues, whilst expenditure may increase, for instance, as a result 
of interest expenses for additional debt taken out for the sup-port measures or of called guarantees. This affects the deficit 
and  consequently  also  the  debt  levels.  A  recapitalisation  of 
banks by the government has an impact on the deficit ratio only if the government cannot expect an adequate return. Oth-
erwise, it is a financial transaction (acquisition of a recoverable 
financial asset) which has no influence on the government de-ficit ratio, but raises government debt and government assets. By contrast, covering losses or transfers raise both the deficit and the debt level.

the onset of the crisis. Although consolidation 
has started, debt ratios have continued to rise, 
reaching figures far in excess of 100% – except 
in Spain. In some countries, expenditure on 
supporting banks has also been an important 
factor.3
The revenue ratios corrected for cyclical factors 
and bank support measures4 have changed 
only moderately overall in all countries since 
2009. They are, however, lower in Spain, Ire -
land, Greece and Cyprus than in Portugal and 
Italy, and also perceptibly lower than the euro- 
area average. Yet the moderate overall change 
in the ratios masks considerable increases in 
taxes and levies in all countries except Italy. 
However, these are offset by revenue-  
dampening factors in other areas. These in -
clude the incipient correction of macroeco -
nomic imbalances and changes in the eco -
nomic structure with the necessary move away 
from the construction industry and domestic 
private consumption and towards fiscally less 
profitable areas such as exports. Adjusted pri -
mary expenditure (total expenditure less inter -
est expenditure) made a larger contribution to 
consolidation than the revenue side in almost 
all countries. This is a welcome development, 
as studies suggest that consolidation strategies 
that focus on expenditure are probably more 
promising in the medium and long term than 
those that target revenues.5
Individual countries still face 
considerable challenges
Remarkable progress has already been made in 
many of the countries under observation. How -
ever, deficits remain high, and considerable fur -
ther adjustments are still required. Moreover, 
caution is necessary when assessing the re -
maining structural deficits. Determining overall 
potential output involves some uncertainty – 
especially in an environment characterised by 
major economic upheaval (see pages 19 to 37). 
That is relevant also for estimating structural 
government deficits, although this applies less to the structural changes previously in the spot -
light than to the levels. The European Commis -
sion is currently reporting perceptibly negative 
aggregate output gaps for most of the coun -
tries hit hardest by the crisis; this means that 
the levels of the structural deficits are thought 
to be considerably lower than the unadjusted 
deficits. In the past, it has, however, often Consolidation

proved a mistake to diagnose in real time 
purely cyclical weakness, as this weakness 
often subsequently proved to be at least partly 
structural. As a consequence, the economic 
normalisation did not bring about the antici -
pated automatic reduction in the deficit, and 
deficits proved persistent. With hindsight, it is 
clear that real- time cyclical deficits and sur -
pluses have not balanced over time.6 The fact 
that growth forecasts have frequently been re -
vised down recently also suggests that a con -
servative approach is warranted.
Among the countries particularly badly affected 
by the crisis, Greece is a case apart in many re -
spects. Although it has achieved by far the 
greatest consolidation, it remains to be seen 
whether the second adjustment programme 
will be implemented as planned. The pro -
gramme has already been repeatedly revised or 
even completely replaced. For one thing, ex -
pectations about economic and fiscal develop -
ments proved too optimistic, and structural problems were underestimated. For another, 
some of the originally agreed measures were 
not implemented in full or on time. Although 
private creditors’ claims were restructured in 
2012, question marks remain regarding the 
sustainability of Greek’s government debt. The 
debt ratio will be significantly reduced as 
planned only if macroeconomic and fiscal as -
sumptions are, in fact, realised. In this, short-  
term cyclical developments will be less decisive 
than potential growth, which is driven mainly 
by structural reforms. Future developments in 
Greece will depend, not least, on whether 
there is confidence that the country will steer a 
reliable political course.
In improving their structural fiscal position, Por -
tugal and Italy have already made considerable 
headway on the road to sound public finances. 
Portugal started out in more unfavourable cir -
cumstances, and its financial assistance pro -
gramme has also been adjusted several times. 
However, the Troika (the International Monet -
ary Fund and the European Commission in li -
aison with the European Central Bank) has 
deemed implementation in Portugal to be sat -
isfactory overall. That said, if the country is to 
exit the programme on schedule in mid-2014 
and regain access to the capital markets, it will 
need to persevere with structural reforms and 
consolidation. There is uncertainty not least as 
to whether elements of the measures decided 
upon in order to implement the agreed course 
of consolidation might once again be declared 
unconstitutional. In Italy, the main priority is 
not to jeopardise the consolidation success al -
ready achieved but rather to be rigorous in pur -
suing the steps which remain to be taken to 
achieve a structural budget surplus, enabling 
rapid reduction in the elevated debt ratio des -
pite weak potential growth. The course of fis -
cal consolidation announced by the previous 
government at the height of the crisis has 
 recently been watered down significantly. If Greece a case

 efforts were limited to keeping the deficit ratio 
consistently just below the 3% threshold, the 
country would remain very vulnerable to fur -
ther negative shocks.
In Ireland, improvement in the structural fiscal 
position so far has not been particularly pro -
nounced compared with that of other coun -
tries heavily affected by the crisis, and the 
structural deficit remains very high. However, 
the fiscal conditions attached to the financial assistance programme were all satisfactorily 
met, according to the Troika’s assessment, and 
the programme was completed in December 
2013. Now, the main priority is continuing to 
be rigorous in staying the course towards sound public finances, even without a pro -
gramme to comply with. Cyprus, too, has re -
ceived positive initial reviews of the assistance 
programme agreed in spring 2013, but the pro -
cess of consolidation is only just beginning here. In Spain, the assistance programme for 
the financial sector ended in January 2014; a 
significant portion of the credit line was not 
drawn down. Despite notable progress on con -
solidation, the fiscal deficit remains high, and 
the details of further measures to achieve the 
3% threshold and a balanced structural budget 
need to be elaborated. The large degree of fis -
cal autonomy enjoyed by the regional govern -
ments presents a particular challenge with re -
spect to planning and implementing deficit re -
duction. It remains to be seen whether en-
hanced monitoring by the central government 
within the framework of the new debt brake 
will actually prevent the regions from missing 
their targets, as was observed in the past.
Some countries’ banking sectors continue to 
harbour risks for public finances which are dif-ficult to gauge – particularly but not only those 
countries in which the banking industry has 
large total assets on aggregate relative to GDP . 
Banks’ assets have been scaled back, of course, 
in some cases extensively. The aggregated total 
assets of Irish banks, for example, have shrunk 
by around 40% since the onset of the crisis. In 
addition, major cleansing of bank balance sheets has been assisted by shifting distressed 
assets to resolution agencies, and banks have 
been recapitalised, sometimes using funds 
from assistance programmes. Nonetheless, the 
need for additional government support can -
not be ruled out, for instance in response to 
the comprehensive balance sheet assessment 
in the run-  up to European banking union. 
(On  deleveraging in the banking sector, see 
pages 59 ff.)
Further swift  
consolidation needed
Despite a considerable consolidation drive in 
recent years, public finances in the countries hardest hit by the crisis are not yet in sound 
health, and confidence in their sustainability re -
mains shaky. It is therefore largely undisputed 
that government deficit and debt ratios need 
to be brought down. However, a lively debate 
continues to be had, both by politicians and 
economists, about the right speed at which to consolidate.
Proponents of a halt to consolidation or of 
slower consolidation point to the short-  term  
loss of growth which is generally associated 
with deficit-  r eduction measures. With many of 
those countries most severely affected by the 
crisis presently in recession, those measures 
have had a procyclical effect, all the more so as 
the fall in real GDP associated with deficit-  
reduction measures – the fiscal multiplier – is, 
they argue, particularly marked during a reces-
sion.
However, despite a range of academic research 
on the matter, there is a great deal of uncer -
tainty as to the magnitude of the fiscal multi -
pliers, with the results of individual studies 
 varying widely (see the box on pages 46 and 47). 
Their magnitude depends on many factors, 
such as the nature of the consolidation meas -
ures, the size of government debt, the degree 
of interconnectedness with the international 
economy, the response by monetary policy -Though other

Short- term effect of fi  scal measures on economic growth
Most of the euro- area countries hit espe-
cially hard by the crisis are not only faced with the task of repairing their public 
 fi  nances, but are also suffering from a pro-
nounced economic downturn, which is as-
sociated with high unemployment. If and to 
what extent fi  scal consolidation dampens the growth of gross domestic product 
(GDP) in the short term is therefore an im-
portant and controversial question. There is little dispute that fi  scal consolidation – par-
ticularly if carried out via spending cuts 
when expenditure ratios are high initially – 
promotes economic development in the 
long term.
The impact of consolidation on economic 
output is measured using fi  scal multipliers, 
with studies showing a fairly broad spread 
of values. For consolidation measures 
amounting to 1% of GDP , most studies es-
tablish a short- term negative impact on the 
GDP growth rate of between 0 and 1 per-
centage point. Very high multiplier values of 
above two are reported just as rarely as a positive impact.
1 A number of factors evi-
dently infl  uence the size of the multiplier. 
Cuts in either government consumption or 
investment directly impacting aggregate demand tend to involve higher short- term growth losses than increases in taxes and social contributions.
2 Sclerotic labour and 
product markets with comparatively rigid nominal wages and prices have higher multipliers as a result, because the neces-sary adjustments are then carried out via 
quantitative reactions, which means losses 
in output and employment. For similar rea-
sons, the multiplier tends to be higher in 
the case of fi  xed exchange rates. The multi-plier also generally increases if an economy 
is not very open, because if international 
trade links are weak the withdrawal of de-mand will make itself felt domestically to a greater extent.Particularly relevant for the economic policy 
debate about consolidation in the peripheral 
countries are infl  uences which can cause the 
fi  scal multipliers in these countries to be 
higher or lower than normal at the current 
time. Results of recent empirical studies sug-
gest that multipliers are particularly high 
during an economic downturn.3 One reason 
for this could be that in a downturn with 
high unemployment a particularly large number of households use their remaining 
income entirely for consumption purposes. 
If the fi  scal consolidation causes further  reductions in income, these can no longer 
be cushioned with a temporary decrease in savings or temporary borrowing and the fall 
in aggregate demand is correspondingly greater. Such effects can be amplifi  ed fur-
ther through a fi  nancial crisis which entails a credit squeeze and through high private sec-tor debt. A fi  nancial crisis also harbours the danger that diffi   cult access to loan fi  nancing 
will discourage enterprises from making in-
vestments. It should be noted, however, 
that if public fi  nances are unsound, forgoing 
consolidation may exacerbate the credit

crunch because the further losses in the 
value of government bonds which could then be expected would place additional 
strain on banks.4
One of the arguments sometimes cited in favour of currently elevated multipliers in 
the countries particularly hard hit by the cri-
sis is that monetary policy can no longer cushion the effects of ﬁ  scal consolidation 
on the real economy if the interest rates set by the central bank are in any case already close to zero. Various simulation studies in-
deed yield higher ﬁ  scal multipliers if the 
monetary policy response to declining price pressure is eliminated.
5 However, monetary 
policy has other (unconventional) instru-
ments in addition to interest rate policy and 
has used these in recent years. The argu-ment is only important for the euro- area 
countries most severely affected by the cri-sis because many of them are currently con-
solidating their budgets at the same time, 
thus also inﬂ  uencing price development in 
the euro area overall (the relevant reference 
point for single monetary policy). Other-wise, monetary policy geared towards the euro- area aggregate does not respond to 
consolidation in individual countries.
The fact that many countries are currently repairing their public ﬁ  nances simultan-eously reduces the ﬁ  scal multiplier to the 
extent that this prompts a monetary policy response. On the other hand, ﬁ  scal consoli-
dation also leads to losses in demand in 
trading partner countries via fewer imports. 
However, the interaction created by simul-
taneous consolidation is not likely to be 
very signiﬁ  cant in quantitative terms.6
There are, nevertheless, also a number of 
factors which suggest lower multipliers cur-rently in the countries hit especially hard by the crisis. The multiplier tends to be smaller 
the higher the debt ratio of the country in 
question.7 Furthermore, positive conﬁ  dence 
effects may cause a marked reduction in short- term growth losses. A credible, swift 
consolidation policy may lessen uncertainty about the government’s ability and willing-
ness to pay, as well as about expected 
 medium to long- term fiscal burdens, 
thereby reviving economic activity. In par-ticular, risk premiums – quite considerable 
in some cases – which many of the coun-
tries severely affected by the crisis have to 
pay when borrowing on the capital market 
may be cut.8 Insofar as this also decreases 
the interest rates for consumer and corpor-
ate loans, domestic demand may be 
boosted and the multiplier thus reduced.
The overall conclusion is that the size of ﬁ  s-
cal multipliers depends on the country 
under review, the time, the macroeconomic 
and ﬁ  scal environment as well as a series of further factors and is subject to high uncer-
tainty. As explained on pages 45ff, as well 
as the size of the multipliers other factors 
also play an important role in the question 
of the appropriate speed of consolidation, 
and rapid ﬁ  scal consolidation is called for in vulnerable countries.
4 Empirical studies do not deliver a consistent picture 
with regard to the inﬂ  uence of ﬁ  nancial crises but tend to point towards higher multipliers. See, for example,

ments and ﬁ  nancial stress: A threshold VAR analysis,

makers, the actual business cycle position, and, 
not least, capital market confidence in the 
soundness of public finances and the associ -
ated danger of risk premiums.
Gauging the magnitude of the multipliers is 
particularly crucial if a very high value would 
mean consolidation causing a short- term or 
even long- term worsening in public finances 
rather than any improvement (“self- defeating 
consolidation”).7 However, under realistic as -
sumptions, a rise in the deficit ratio resulting 
from consolidation measures is very unlikely 
even in the short term. On the other hand, if 
high but quite plausible multiplier values are as -
sumed, the debt ratio may well initially show a 
more unfavourable pattern than it would have 
done without the deficit reduction measures.8 
Though the absolute level of debt will be lower 
than it would be without consolidation, owing 
to the smaller deficit, the debt ratio may none -
theless rise because of the effect of consolida -
tion on GDP , which is the denominator in the 
ratio. This is more likely the higher the multi -
plier and the debt ratio. However, in the me -
dium and long term, the debt ratio will fall 
even in this scenario, as the dampening effect 
of consolidation on GDP growth –  not con -
sidering any weakening in potential growth – is 
only temporary. In the crisis, the financial mar -
kets have, in any case, responded mostly posi -
tively to consolidation measures and negatively 
to political uncertainty about these measures.
Therefore, when gauging the right speed of 
consolidation, its influence on potential growth 
– as well as the credibility of any announce -
ment of later consolidation – is more important 
than its short- term effect. A lasting impact may 
result from impaired potential growth, which is 
ultimately crucial to the sustainability of public 
finances. Exacerbated underutilisation of pro -
ductive potential brought on by fiscal consoli -
dation can impede growth in potential output. 
Then, reduced growth would not be fully re -
covered in the subsequent upturn. Such might 
be the case, for instance, if what started as cyc -
lical unemployment hardened into long-  term unemployment owing to a depletion of human 
capital (eg in the form of lost skills), the labour 
force were less productive after a period of un -
employment (hysteresis), or if workers, particu -
larly skilled ones, emigrated.
On the other hand, amidst all this uncertainty, 
proponents of swift consolidation can point to 
the fact that a considerable part of the eco -
nomic collapse in the countries most severely 
affected by the crisis cannot be regarded as 
cyclically induced weakness (see pages  19 
to 37). From this perspective, there is a danger 
that inefficient economic structures will be kept 
in place for too long and the requisite adjust -
ment process and reforms will be put off. 
Further more, consolidation may actually 
strengthen potential growth if it creates confi -
dence in the long- term sustainability of public 
finances, and, as a result, risk premiums on 
interest rates fall, and if the yields on govern -
ment bonds and interest payments on corpor -
ate borrowing are closely correlated. A loss of 
confidence in public finances and rapidly rising 
yields would, in any case, be highly destabilis -
ing even in the short term, and would probably 
more than outweigh any other, positive effects 
attained by deferring consolidation. In add -
ition, high debt ratios may impair potential 
growth because government borrowing 
crowds out private borrowing and investment, 
and high interest payments have to be financed 
through distortionary taxation which also tends 
to hamper growth.9
In the medium and long term at least, struc -
tural reforms which boost potential growth can 
lend support to fiscal consolidation. For in -Debt ratio may 
be increased temporarily by consolidation in unfavourable circumstances, but can be  expected to fall 
in the future

A one- off capital levy: 
a suitable instrument for solving national solvency crises within the current EMU framework?
In the course of the current sovereign debt 
crisis, strong doubts have occasionally 
arisen as to whether individual euro- area 
member states are capable of servicing their 
government debt or whether they are im-plementing the necessary measures at the political level. At times, risk premiums on the respective government bonds rose sharply and the credit assessments of the major rating agencies were downgraded considerably. This situation prompted the 
euro area to agree various assistance meas-
ures. While such measures were generally 
subject to consolidation requirements, they 
nevertheless imply a substantial mutualisa-
tion of sovereign solvency risks without 
being counterbalanced by a corresponding 
transfer of sovereign powers to the central level.
However, the EMU governance framework 
set up with the European Union treaties  essentially remains in place. Under this 
framework, the member states themselves 
are primarily responsible for their own na-
tional fi  scal and economic policies, the 
 assumption of liability for the debts of other 
member states is largely excluded, and the  monetary fi  nancing of governments through the single monetary policy is pro-
hibited. This should ensure that liability and 
control are interconnected inasmuch as, in 
the fi  rst instance, it is the taxpayers of the 
respective member states who bear respon-
sibility for their national sovereign debt. If 
solvency problems still cannot be resolved, 
sovereign debt creditors should next be 
called on to bear the fi  nancial risks of their investment decisions themselves in line with 
market economy principles. Economic ad-justment programmes fi  nanced by taxpay-
ers from other member states should only 
be employed as an exception and a last line of defence in cases where the fi  nancial sta-
bility of the euro area as a whole would otherwise be in grave danger. Moreover, 
such programmes presuppose that the state in question “merely” has a liquidity problem and that its public fi  nances are either sus-tainable or that sustainability has mean-
while been re- established by suitable meas-
ures. Given the Eurosystem’s stability man-
date, granting (real) debt relief via higher infl  ation should be out of the question. 
Thus, a crucial principle of the current EMU 
governance framework is that a member 
state experiencing a crisis must fully utilise 
its own resources and capabilities available 
in order to restore confi  dence in the sus-tainability of its public fi  nances and thus 
avert the otherwise likely scenario of a sov-ereign default that would surely amount to a national emergency.
The current crisis has shown that confi  -
dence in the ability of a number of states to 
service their own debts has been eroded 
even though high government liabilities are, in some cases, backed by considerable pub-
lic and private assets. In fact, these assets 
sometimes form a greater fraction of GDP 
than in the countries providing assistance.1 
This being so, it would appear sensible to fi  rst lower government debt by mobilising government assets through privatisation measures. But beyond that, one may also 
ask whether, in the exceptional situation of 
a national emergency, privatisations and 
conventional consolidation measures aimed at the long- term generation of sizeable pri-mary surpluses should be supplemented by 
a contribution from existing private assets 
towards averting the threat of a sovereign 
default.2
1 This can be inferred from the ECB’s “Household 
 Finance and Consumption Survey” (http://www.ecb.
europa.eu/home/html/researcher_hfcn.en.html), the 
 fi  nancial accounts and the national accounts.2 The option of introducing a capital levy has recently been discussed from various angles: see S Bach (2012), 
Capital Levies – A Step Towards Improving Public 
 Finances in Europe, DIW Economic Bulletin 8; or IMF, 
Fiscal Monitor, “Taxing times”, October 2013, p 49. The arguments presented here expressly refer to the special case of countries experiencing a fi  scal emer-
gency where a capital levy constitutes an alternative to sovereign default.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
January 2014

With this special context in mind, this box 
outlines the various aspects of a one- off 
levy on domestic private net wealth, in 
other words, a levy on assets after liabilities 
have been deducted. From a macroeco-
nomic perspective, a capital levy – and even more so a permanent tax on wealth – is, in principle, beset with considerable problems, 
and the necessary administrative outlay in-
volved as well as the associated risks for an economy’s growth path are high. In the ex-
ceptional situation of a looming sovereign default, however, a one- off capital levy 
could prove more favourable than the other 
available alternatives. Placing an additional 
but, compared to the capital levy, more pro-
tracted burden on the private sector through ongoing charges, primarily in the form of consumption or income- related 
taxes, or making more drastic cuts to gov-
ernment spending might no longer be suffi   -cient or might be considered impossible to 
enforce. Ultimately this concerns scenarios 
in which potential creditors have massive doubts about the country’s debt sustain-ability, such that a one- off capital levy is 
considered as an alternative to a sovereign default.
Under favourable conditions, a net wealth 
levy could bring about a one- off redistribu-tion of wealth between the private and the 
public sector within the country in ques-tion, thereby facilitating a relatively rapid and signifi  cant fall in the sovereign debt level and the faster restoration of confi  -dence in the sustainability of public debt (and the country’s debt servicing). If the 
levy is referenced to wealth accumulated in the past
3 and it is believed that it will never 
be repeated again, it is diffi   cult for taxpay-ers to evade it in the short term, and its det-rimental impact on employment and saving 
incentives will be limited – unlike that of a 
permanent tax on wealth. A rapid fall in sovereign debt could, in particular, have a 
positive effect on the risk premiums of gov-ernment bonds for the country in question, 
and employment and saving incentives 
would be strengthened as a result of lower 
uncertainty concerning future tax burdens. 
The public acceptance and political enforce-ability of a one- off capital levy could be en-hanced by deploying it as an instrument of 
income redistribution, complementing the retrenchment efforts, which ensures that 
wealthy individuals shoulder a larger share 
of the adjustment burden,  especially as the 
specifi  c redistributional  effects for a given 
levy volume can be steered by granting tax- free allowances and tapering the tax sched-ule.
As a result, the general economic outlook and public acceptance of the necessary  fi  scal measures in the country concerned 
may fare better than under the alternative 
scenario of a sovereign default. Not least, it 
would be in keeping with the principle of individual national responsibility for fi  scal 
policy in the member states if all consolida-tion options were rigorously utilised, and it would simultaneously bolster the credibility 
of the prevailing European governance framework. The incentives for pursuing a sound fi  scal policy in the future could be considerably strengthened if it were clear 
that, in the event of a crisis, the cost of pur-suing unsound policies could not be shifted onto taxpayers in other countries.
However, in practice the collection even of 
a one- off net wealth levy entails consider-
able diffi   culties. One of the broad set of 
conditions necessary to ensure successful implementation is the credibility that the 
levy will indeed be imposed as a once- only 
measure in an extraordinary national crisis 
situation – which is the only way to limit the negative impact on investment and the po-
tential for capital fl  ight. Although the gov-
ernment cannot guarantee in general that 
the levy will be a one- off measure, it would enjoy greater credibility if, fi  rst, the requisite 
structural reforms were put in place, second, a verifi  able outlook of sustainable public fi  nances including safety margins 
were given, and, third, the political costs of 
a repeat levy were high. In addition, the  decision to raise a levy should be made 
swiftly. Otherwise, those affected would be 
more likely to seek to evade the tax, and, 
with a rising level of tax evasion, the public

stance, the government deficit ratio will fall if 
higher government tax receipts generated by 
growth are not fully matched by higher ex -
penditure. Even the debt ratio will then fall 
more quickly, aided by a larger denominator 
supplied by higher GDP growth. Government 
expenditure can also be reduced directly: for 
instance, through labour market reforms which 
reduce structural unemployment. Reforming an 
inefficient, growth- inhibiting public sector may 
also both support short- term deficit reduction 
and improve a country’s growth prospects. In 
addition, structural reforms may reduce risk 
premiums on yields, as these are not only 
caused by fiscal difficulties but may also reflect 
trade imbalances and implicit risks to public fi -
nances.10 For these reasons, it makes sense not 
to limit conditions for programme countries to 
fiscal consolidation but to strive for a compre -
hensive adjustment in the overall economy and 
the financial sector through changes in the 
economic policy framework.The appropriate speed for consolidation also 
hinges crucially on the credibility of the consoli -
dation process. Particular attention needs to be 
paid to this consideration if a sovereign is fa -
cing the threat of default because capital in -
vestors’ trust has been severely dented and pri -
vate funds are therefore being withdrawn. Ex -
ternal payments crises of this nature arose in 
many of the countries most affected by the 
crisis. If the impression is created that little 
more than lip service is being paid to consolida -
tion, while the necessary cuts are actually being 
pushed further and further back, there is a dan -
ger that risk premiums will not continue to fall 
but instead the sovereign debt crisis will flare 
up again. In this scenario, slower consolidation Structural 
 reforms a key 
complement to fiscal  consolidationCredibility of consolidation process  crucial …acceptance of the levy could be expected 
to diminish. Other problems are that the 
valuation of non- fi  nancial assets, in particu-lar, is likely to be relatively time- consuming 
and often contested, and that, in the case 
of illiquid assets, it would probably be  necessary to spread payment of the levy 
over a period of time, which means that the 
reduction in government debt would not 
take place in its entirety straightaway.
In addition, once a levy had been raised, 
this would send a signal to other countries 
with very high public debt levels, and may 
trigger evasive responses. It would probably 
be a considerable challenge to limit these 
effects by pointing to a euro- area- wide out-look for sound public fi  nances. The rigorous implementation of the current fi  scal frame-work may certainly help in this respect.
Overall, a one- off net wealth levy entails considerable risks, and the conditions for successful implementation are not easy to fulfi  l. Therefore, a capital levy should be considered only in absolutely exceptional 
circumstances, such as that of a looming 
sovereign default. However, in comparison 
to a sovereign default, the imposition of a 
capital levy could probably take place in a 
more structured and orderly way. It would 
conform to the principle of individual na-
tional responsibility, according to which 
 domestic taxpayers should be fi  rst in line to 
cover their government’s liabilities, before 
any appeal is made to the solidarity of other countries.

or postponement to a later date may incur 
heavy macroeconomic costs. The credibility of 
a consolidation path can be bolstered by bind -
ing rules, provided these rules are generally re -
garded as effective and are expected to be 
obeyed. The European fiscal rules should make 
a significant contribution to building trust in 
sound public finances in the euro area. These 
rules were reformed over the course of the cri -
sis, with some loopholes eliminated, and in 
principle they furnish a suitable framework for 
the necessary fiscal consolidation. However, 
some recent decisions in European forums raise 
doubts as to whether they will actually be rig -
orously applied.11 At the same time, reform and 
consolidation fatigue seems to be on the in -
crease at present in many of the countries most 
affected by the crisis.
With regard to political acceptance and feasi -
bility, there can be no doubt that consolidation 
measures are not popular in the short term, 
one of the reasons ultimately for policymakers’ 
general propensity to borrow. However, swift, 
thorough- going measures which level off rela -
tively quickly may meet with greater accept -
ance than smaller rounds of consolidation re -
peated over a number of years with visible re -
sults taking longer to come through and add -
itional measures being needed time and again.
All in all, the current financial and debt crisis 
presents fiscal policymakers in the countries hit 
hardest by the crisis with a major challenge. 
Their public finances, with very high and still 
rising debt ratios, remain vulnerable to negative 
shocks. Although these countries are engaged 
in a difficult process of general economic ad -
justment, and deleveraging is also required in 
the private sector, the course of fiscal consoli -
dation is unavoidable. Otherwise, there will be 
an increased risk of an even more far- reaching 
loss of confidence in the sustainability of public 
finances, which would have significantly more negative effects still. In addition, consolidation 
creates room for any future calls on govern -
ment resources, such as contributions to a re -
capitalisation of banking systems if shortfalls in 
cover come to light and investors cannot be 
bailed in to a sufficient extent. Ensuring sus -
tainable government finances will thus make a 
significant contribution to ensuring the crisis 
can be dealt with in an orderly fashion and, 
under the current EU framework, remains es -
sentially a task for national governments. If 
there is a threat of government over-  
indebtedness such that severe consequences 
may result, then far- reaching emergency meas -
ures such as private net wealth contributions 
must not be ruled out ex ante  (see the box 
about capital levies on pages  49 to 51). The 
newly created assistance funds are to provide 
liquidity support to member states in difficulties 
– with conditionalities attached – only if the 
 financial stability of the euro area as a whole is 
endangered, and as a last resort.
Sound public finances are a central require -
ment for a single monetary policy in the mon -
etary union if price stability at low interest rates 
is to be safeguarded in the medium and long 
term. It has become apparent from the debt 
crisis that the makers of the single monetary 
policy may otherwise feel pressured into taking 
measures which are in a grey area of their man -
date in order to prevent acute escalation. Even 
measures like these can only buy time for the 
requisite reform and consolidation measures, 
and they come at the cost of harmful incen -
tives in the long term. It is crucial that this time 
be used effectively. Thus, for this reason too, 
countries at risk need to implement reliable and 
swift fiscal consolidation.… but doubts

Private debt – status quo , need for 
adjustment and policy implications
The debt crisis in some euro- area countries is not confined to the public sector. In the years run -
ning up to the financial and economic crisis, which were characterised by favourable financing 
conditions, some euro- area countries experienced unsustainable economic upturns driven by 
domestic demand, which were primarily financed via the domestic banking sector. The associated 
significant rise in non- financial private sector debt is a key cause of the crisis. Confidence in the 
sustainability of private debt was shaken after it became evident that the income available to 
service debts, and moreover realisable assets, were considerably and fundamentally lower than 
had previously been assumed. To overcome the crisis, a reliable outlook for dealing with and 
reducing excessive debt is required.
The euro area as a whole has seen debt ratios move sideways since the outbreak of the crisis. 
However, the underlying developments are heterogeneous in nature and vary both among coun -
tries and among sectors in the countries concerned. An analysis of euro- area debt developments, 
particularly a comparison with previous episodes of private debt overhang, shows that the related 
adjustment process has not yet been completed. The fact that it is not clear who will ultimately 
have to bear potential losses is particularly problematic. The national banking systems in question 
are still saddled with a large amount of non- performing loans, meaning that there might be fur -
ther need for adjustment in this respect. This uncertainty and the possible need for government 
aid can, in turn, knock confidence in public finances.
Persistently high debt among households and non- financial corporations, as well as uncertainty 
about how to tackle the problem, can dampen economic developments in the longer run. It is 
therefore incumbent on national economic policymakers to ensure that, in the context of the 
adjustment processes, the reduction of sectoral debt overhang can be supported by vital restruc -
turing and rigorous write- downs. This requires a realistic assessment of the quality of existing 
claims in the banking system and adequate capitalisation of the latter in a timely manner. The 
upcoming comprehensive assessment (CA) in those countries participating in the banking union 
should be a key milestone in this respect. It should shed light on how any financial burdens are 
distributed, thereby providing a reliable outlook for the banking systems and for public finances. 
This is all the more the case given that monetary policy can only assist in overcoming the crisis 
and is not itself the solution. A strongly accommodative monetary policy stance over an extended 
period of time can unintentionally even play a role in delaying the necessary adjustment pro -
cesses, particularly the repair of unsustainable balance sheets.Deutsche Bundesbank

Development and  
structure of debt
Debt in the run- up to the crisis
The years leading up to the financial and eco -
nomic crisis saw a build- up of macroeconomic 
imbalances within the euro  area (see pages 19 
to 37). In some euro- area countries,1 favour -
able financing conditions and high income ex -
pectations fuelled the creation of an economic 
boom, financed via the domestic banking sec -
tor in particular.2 The pronounced level of le -
veraged investment activity in the non- financial 
corporate sector focused primarily on less pro -
ductive fixed capital formation in the real estate 
sector. Buoyed by rising property prices, house -
holds also had a greater propensity to run up 
debt in order to finance spending on real es -
tate, as well as on consumption.
Since the mid-1990s, sectoral debt ratios3 have 
increased significantly throughout the euro 
area, especially in Portugal, Ireland and Spain 
(see the chart on page 55). In particular, cor -
porate debt in Portugal and household debt in 
Ireland were comparatively high even before 
the introduction of the euro. Although the 
debt ratios for Italy and Greece mostly recorded 
above- average growth, having started from a 
relatively low level, they nevertheless always re -
mained below the euro- area aggregate ratio. 
However, debt ratios are based on actual sec -
toral income and are thus understated for the 
period prior to the crisis, owing to the unsus -
tainably high level of economic output, as is 
the scale of the decline during the current 
downturn.
The increase in euro- area debt levels is primarily 
attributable to long- term bank loans and, in 
the case of non- financial corporations, add -
itionally to intra- sector lending (particularly in -
tra- group loans). The build- up of equity largely 
lagged behind growth in debt, thereby weak -
ening enterprises’ capital position. Against the 
backdrop of the investment boom, long- term 
mortgage loans dominated household debt and gained momentum in Ireland and Spain in 
particular from 2003 onwards. A large propor -
tion of mortgage loans were floating rate con -
tracts, especially in Spain and Portugal.4 Such 
contracts generally have a higher interest rate 
risk, but in periods of falling interest rates they 
can noticeably ease the debt servicing burden.
It should be noted, as a general point, that the 
accumulation and scale of private debt are not 
only influenced by (sectoral) income and ex -
pectations in this regard, but also by a coun -
try’s institutional framework, and that the 
underlying factors must be borne in mind when 
analysing debt developments. A case in point is 
the Netherlands, where under the terms and 
conditions of most housing loan contracts only 
interest has to be paid during the term of the 
loan. The actual repayment is not due until the 
loan has reached maturity. During the lifetime 
of the loan, there is usually a commensurate 
formation of assets, which is reflected in the 
statistics in the form of higher financial assets. 
This results in systematically higher debt ratios 
which are, however, not accompanied by an 
increased debt servicing burden. Furthermore, 
in the Netherlands, as was the case in Spain 
until 2011, interest payments on housing loans 
are tax- deductible, reducing the debt servicing Macroeconomic

3 Debt ratios show the debt of a sector in relation to a 
(sectoral or aggregate) flow of income. Debt is defined as 
total outstanding liabilities (unconsolidated) in the form of 
securities (excluding equity), loans and insurance technical 
reserves. The data are based on the results of the financial 
accounts, which are collected for all euro- area countries in 
accordance with uniform methodological requirements. 
The latter stipulate inter alia a market valuation of all bal -
ance sheet items. For a detailed description of conceptual

Debt ratio developments: 
breakdown into redemption, 
valuation and growth 
 contributions
The onset of the financial and economic crisis 
saw a re- evaluation of income prospects and 
asset prices and the repricing of risk, compel -
ling the private sector to make large- scale bal -
ance sheet adjustments. These were particu -
larly necessary in those countries whose non-  
financial private sectors had especially high 
debt servicing burdens (interest and redemp -
tion payments).
In the euro area as a whole, non- financial pri -
vate sector debt ratios have moved sideways or 
edged higher since the start of the crisis. When 
interpreting this development, a distinction 
must be made between the contribution of 
debt, which has increased in the euro area as a 
whole, and that of (nominal) income. While 
households saw their disposable income pick 
up, the gross operating surplus of non- financial 
corporations decreased (see the chart on 
page  56). However, developments differed 
across the euro area. For example, Italy and 
households in Greece recorded a rise in debt 
ratios. While in Italy this increase was due to 
both positive transactions, ie a build-  up of 
debt, as well as to dwindling income, for Greek 
households, transaction- based deleveraging, ie 
the redemption of liabilities, was overshadowed 
by weak macroeconomic developments. Only 
the Spanish non-  financial private sector and 
households in Ireland and Portugal have con -
sistently seen a significant transaction- based 
decline in debt ratios since 2010, in some cases 
despite weak income developments. The inter -
est burden faced by the non- financial private 
sector has diminished markedly since the out -
break of the crisis in an environment of low 
interest rates, effectively increasing the loan re -
payment capacity.Need for adjustment in

the individual episodes bear different hallmarks, 
such as the percentage of debt denominated in 
foreign currency or the creditor structure, 
which complicate any comparison, the inten -
sity of the preceding debt accumulation none -
theless typically appears to influence the scale 
of the ensuing downturn.7
In principle, a similar pattern emerges for the 
euro- area countries in question. However, a 
comparison reveals that both the debt dynam -
ics prior to the crisis and the subsequent reces -
sion were at times more marked than in previ -
ous private sector debt crises. Much like in earl -
ier crises, the euro area, too, saw a decline in 
consumption and investment after the onset of 
the crisis owing to a shift in framework condi -
tions and significant changes in behaviour. Un -
sustainable current account balances shrank 
and saving ratios rose. Households and non-  
financial corporations curbed their spending so 
that they could service their debts and ease the 
financial burdens associated with high debt levels.8 When analysing the nature of the ad -
justment to the new framework conditions, it 
must also be taken into account that the op -
tion of adjusting nominal exchange rates in 
order to improve price competitiveness, sup -
port economic growth and reduce the real 
debt burden in the country’s own currency is 
not available (see pages  67 to 78). In debt 
 crises with flexible exchange rates, this con-
stituted an important stabilisation instrument.9… but euro-

By contrast, in typical economic downturns 
without a financial or debt crisis, the real eco -
nomic contraction is significantly milder. Debt 
dynamics also resemble earlier patterns in most 
cases (see the chart on page 58). However, if 
investment and consumption during the period 
of expansion were excessively financed by 
debt, this typically led to a correction in the 
form of deleveraging, and the “bursting” of the 
debt bubble brought a sharper real economic 
contraction in its wake.
Compared with previous episodes of private 
debt overhang, it is clear that the adjustment 
process in the euro area following the acute 
phase of the financial crisis has so far taken 
place at a fairly gradual pace. This is especially 
true given the exceptionally sharp increase in 
debt ratios in the run- up to the crisis. Although 
progress has recently been made in deleverag -
ing, debt ratios in the non- financial private sec -
tors of the countries under review have, with 
the exception of Spain, remained stubbornly above their 2008 levels. In previous private sec -
tor debt crises, however, deleveraging over the 
same period of time proceeded at a much 
brisker pace on average, reflecting inter alia  the 
rapid and extensive restructuring of the debtor 
and creditor sectors and the associated stabil -
isation of sectoral income. Overall, this indi -
cates that there remains a marked need for ad -
justment in the euro- area countries in question.
Quantifying the need for 
 private sector deleveraging 
in the euro area
In principle, it is possible to try to calculate the 
potential deleveraging needs in the individual 
sectors using debt ratios that are consistent 
with the respective fundamentally justified 
macroeconomic and institutional developments 
in the long term. However, determining refer -
ence values for appropriate debt ratios poses a 
considerable challenge. As they are not directly Downturn

observable, such reference values have to be at 
least approximately estimated. One option is to 
derive threshold values from the development 
of debt ratios in the past, using statistical filter 
techniques and (long- term) averages. Based on 
the concept of the sustainability of sectoral bal -
ance sheets, it is furthermore possible to deter -
mine the level of debt ratios beyond which 
debt is a significant drag on economic growth.10
Another way of quantifying deleveraging needs 
is to calculate the debt overhang or underhang 
as a measure of the extent to which actual 
debt deviates from empirically estimated hypo -
thetical equilibrium levels. Equilibrium debt de -
velopments are obtained by means of an 
econometric estimate of the long- term rela -
tionship between debt and a range of explana -
tory variables which in empirical terms have a 
stable correlation with debt developments ei -
ther within a country over time or across sev -
eral countries. However, in practice, estimating 
equilibrium debt levels and the resulting debt overhangs entails a host of conceptual prob -
lems. Therefore, the results are considered to 
be of limited informative value.
Although all means of quantifying the need for 
adjustment are fraught with considerable un -
certainty, the various approaches and the his -
torical comparison in particular indicate that 
households and non- financial corporations in 
the countries concerned still need to signifi -
cantly reduce their debt in many cases. This dir -
ects attention to the creditors and thus in par -
ticular to domestic banks, whose balance sheets 
reflect the predominantly bank- based build- up 
of debt in the non- financial private sector.Econometric

Deleveraging in  
the banking sector
In the autumn of 2008, the repricing of risk in 
the wake of the financial crisis put a sudden 
brake on balance sheet growth among banks 
in the euro area. The prospect of a tightening 
of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements 
– a necessary step to safeguard financial stabil -
ity – likewise had a general dampening effect 
on banking business. In the countries on the 
periphery of the euro area, where the build- up 
of leverage in the non- financial private sector 
had led to above- average growth in bank bal -
ance sheets, the crisis revealed problems stem -
ming from this overly risky business model. In 
addition, the major macroeconomic adjust -
ment process in the periphery countries – along 
with the resulting decline in borrowers’ credit -
worthiness  – and the “doom loop” brought 
about by the financial ties between the bank -
ing and public sectors considerably weakened 
the resilience of the banking industry.11
The resulting adjustment process in the bank -
ing sectors of the euro-area periphery countries 
has reduced the total assets on their aggre -
gated balance sheets. However, the intensity 
and speed of this fall have varied across the 
different countries and are closely connected 
with the conditions attached to the support 
they have received from the international com -
munity. While Irish banks have been cutting 
their balance sheets steadfastly since early 
2009, Portuguese and Spanish banks did not 
begin this process until 2011 and 2012, re -
spectively, and problematic assets have also 
been channelled out of the Irish and Spanish 
banking sectors. The amount of non- performing 
loans in the Irish, Spanish and Portuguese 
banking sectors is still on the rise, and this will 
probably make a swift return to higher profits 
more difficult and take up more and more cap -
ital cover even among banks which have just 
been recapitalised. The Greek banking sector 
was recapitalised via the adjustment pro -
gramme, but its domestic bank balance sheets 
have not yet undergone a similar process of re -pair to those in the aforementioned countries, 
which has notably involved a sweeping reduc -
tion in problematic assets.
The process of restructuring bank balance 
sheets has entailed a reduction of claims on the 
non- financial private sector, a shift in the risk 
structure of assets – also extending to other 
balance sheet items – and a strengthening of 
the capital position (see chart on page 60). The 
decline in assets on bank balance sheets in the 
periphery countries (apart from Ireland and Cy -
prus) has largely affected loans to the domestic 
non- financial private sector and, unlike in the 
case of globally interconnected German banks, 
has had less of an impact on derivatives, inter -
bank loans and foreign assets. This is due to 
the domestic focus of those banking sectors12 
and the prior build- up of leverage in the non-  
financial private sector.
As deleveraging in the non- financial private 
sector is still ongoing and economic activity is 
weak in some countries, a major part of the fall 
in loans is due to demand- side factors.13 An 
additional factor is that, for enterprises in some 
of the countries discussed in this article, includ -
ing Spain and Italy, the relative importance of 
bank loans has diminished, with firms turning 
to alternative funding options such as equity 
and bond issuance (see pages 67 to 78). The 
results of the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) indi -
cate that, particularly in the second half of 
2011 and thus shortly before the Eurosystem 
substantially increased the liquidity supply by 
performing three- year longer- term refinancing 
operations (LTROs), bank- side factors also 
played their part in the tightening of credit Banking  business

11 Although these factors are intertwined and mutually re -
inforcing, the main problem in the Irish, Spanish and Portu -
guese banking sectors was high private sector debt, 
coupled with burst real estate bubbles in Ireland and Spain, 
while the woes of the Greek banking sector were mainly 
due to the country’s spiralling sovereign debt problems.

standards in the periphery countries and, 
viewed in isolation, had a dampening effect on 
loan dynamics. All in all, the supply side has 
been a significant but by no means dominant 
factor in the considerable reduction of loans.

also involved adjustments in banks’ other busi -
ness areas, a process crucially influenced by the 
risk weighting of assets in line with the regula -
tory capital requirements and by the special 
regulatory treatment afforded to domestic gov -
ernment bonds, against which banks do not 
have to hold any capital. Particularly in Ireland, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain, banks have distinctly 
increased the proportion of domestic govern -
ment bonds in their total assets over the past 
few years,14 aided, not least, by the central 
bank liquidity they have obtained through the 
three- year LTROs. Viewed in isolation, this has 
made the ties between the public and banking 
sectors – which proved to be a major factor in 
the escalation of the crisis – even tighter.Finally, the restructuring of bank balance sheets 
has also required a notable increase in regula -
tory capital; the pressure exerted by the Basel III 
requirements and the international community 
has prompted banks in the periphery countries 
to begin strengthening their capital positions, 
with government funds contributing substan -
tially to this process.15 This has distinctly in -
creased the ratio of capital and reserves to total 
assets on aggregated bank balance sheets 
(with the exception of Italy).
Although bank restructuring measures and re -
capitalisations have already significantly changed 
the banking landscape in the euro-area periph -
ery countries, the high level of non- performing 
loans and the losses still being posted in most of 
these countries’ banking sectors indicate that 
more adjustments are still needed. Ensuring the 
soundness of individual banks’ finances via the 
CA, which is being performed prior to the launch 
of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), will 
be of vital importance.16

– dictated by economic policy – in which this 
adjustment takes place. To lessen the general 
uncertainty associated with this process, it will 
be particularly important to ensure that the 
banking system is in robust form and to map 
out reliably how deleveraging in the sectors will 
proceed.
In essence, there are two different types of ad -
justment approach. The first entails adjustment 
via flow variables, a process which should, in 
fact, be standard practice. Borrowers in the 
non- financial private sector amortise their debt 
gradually over an extended period of time by 
drawing on their current income, while asset 
shedding can additionally support this income- 
based form of debt redemption.17 A drawn- out 
adjustment process of this kind can create last -
ing uncertainty over which assets will retain 
their value and who will face what write- downs 
in the future, although banks can make provi -
sions for these risks.
The second approach to repairing unsustain -
able balance sheets is to make stock adjust -
ments to debt. This may entail a restructuring 
of liabilities, eg by renegotiating loan contracts 
and taking a haircut on the debt,18 or insolven -
cies involving, among other measures, swift 
write- offs of non- performing loans and loss 
recognition by creditors, ie by banks in particu -
lar. Unlike flow adjustments, this approach in -
variably has a direct impact on balance sheets. 
The capacity for write- downs would largely de -
pend on the state of creditors’ balance sheets, 
especially their capital position.
History has shown that managing debt crises 
generally affects overall economic activity for 
an extended period of time because of the 
need to correct the imbalances that have previ -
ously built up in the financial sector, and usually 
also in the real economy. This adjustment pro -
cess holds various risks. The first is the danger 
of disorderly deleveraging in the short term, 
which creates great uncertainty about whether 
assets will retain their value and whether write- 
downs will be needed. This can affect house -holds, private sector enterprises, the banking 
system and the public sector. As a result, many 
enterprises and households become distinctly 
reluctant to spend, and assets are sold off, 
which can ultimately lead to a sharp economic 
downturn – particularly if, in parallel, financial 
intermediaries cut back the supply of credit be -
cause of their own balance sheet problems, 
heightened borrower risks and receding market 
liquidity.19 Ultimately, the concern reflected in 
this scenario is that reducing debt in various 
sectors at the same time – not just in the pri -
vate but also in the public sector– could desta -
bilise the economy.
In the medium to long term, there is also a 
danger that deleveraging could obstruct the 
creation of new productive capital stock. The 
longer non- financial corporations and banks 
have to cope with weak balance sheets, and 
the longer major uncertainty lingers over how 
any losses associated with the deleveraging will 
be dealt with, the greater this effect is likely to 
be. Another risk is that the low- interest- rate 
environment could tempt banks to put off the 
restructuring process and prolong non-  
performing loans instead of insisting that they 
be repaid on schedule or carrying out write-  
downs which would worsen their already 
strained capital positions. This could delay the 
necessary restructuring in the banking sector, 
weaken its profitability still further and prevent 
new loans from being granted to productive 
businesses, thus leading to a lasting misalloca -
tion of resources. In this scenario, a more re -
strictive monetary policy stance –  which will 
become necessary at some point in the fu -
ture – would then make banks increasingly fra -Adjustment via

gile. It is also important to be aware that, de -
pending on the precise form it takes, short-  
term debt relief can create new wrong incen -
tives. It will be crucial to apply a rules-  based 
approach which creates a sense of certainty for 
present and future lending. Otherwise, new 
imbalances might emerge, or higher risk pre -
miums which would place a drag on invest -
ment and growth potential.
The role of economic 
 policymakers, especially of 
monetary policy, and implica -
tions for the euro area
From an economic policy perspective, it is vital 
to make it clear that the adjustments needed to 
overcome a debt crisis take time and inevitably 
place a considerable drag on the economy. 
Nonetheless, the deleveraging process will 
need to be supported with measures which are 
compatible with the framework of the euro 
area and put the real economy back on a self- 
sustaining growth path as quickly as possible. 
The measures must help to prevent destabilis -
ing dynamics in the financial and product mar -
kets in the short term and, at the same time, 
ensure that a sustainable growth path is swiftly 
established.
One key element of such a policy must be to 
minimise uncertainty surrounding the distribu -
tion of any possible losses, ensuring that the 
national banking systems are in robust form 
and clarifying whether and how any govern -
ment support will be provided. This is the best 
way of making sure that the identified problem 
does not feed through to the medium- term 
growth path.20 The action taken must be com -
patible with the framework of the euro area, 
the key factors in this context being the fact 
that the member states are market economies, 
which means applying the no-bail- out prin -
ciple, their individual responsibility for national 
fiscal and economic policy and the primacy of a 
stability- focused single monetary policy. More 
specifically, this means that private creditors of enterprises, households or banks should be first 
in line to bear the losses arising from necessary 
write- downs and balance sheet repair in the 
private sector. The government of the country 
facing such problems should only provide 
 financial support on an auxiliary basis, and the 
other euro- area countries should only ever be 
involved as a last resort, via the established res -
cue mechanisms.
The Eurosystem has the task of ensuring price 
stability in the euro area and, where necessary, 
taking suitable measures to resolutely combat a 
downward spiral on the product and financial 
markets triggered by a systemic liquidity crisis 
in the euro area. An expansionary monetary 
policy stance stabilises weak developments in 
the real economy. Leaving aside the risks and 
problems that they have entailed in some re -
spects, the Eurosystem’s interest rate cuts and 
its use of non- standard liquidity- providing 
measures have proven effective.21 In particular, 
they have prevented a sudden credit crunch 
due to liquidity and funding shortages.
Yet monetary policy is not responsible for pro -
viding a fundamental solution to the crisis, nor 
should it be expected to take on the loss risks 
of households, enterprises, banks or govern -
ments facing the threat of insolvency. While 
the stock problem on private sector balance 
sheets still exists, monetary policy will also be 
less effective, as overly indebted entities and in -
dividuals are less inclined to borrow and (high- 
risk) borrowers have to pay high interest on 
their debt.22 The empirical evidence suggests 
that the faster private sector deleveraging takes 
place after a financial crisis, the stronger a sus -Suitable eco-

Selected historical adjustment processes: 
the Nordic countries and Japan
A look at adjustment processes in the wake 
of previous predominantly leveraged and 
unsustainable economic upturns sheds light 
on the implications of various adjustment 
strategies. Despite all the differences in the 
baseline situations and underlying condi-
tions of the cases considered, some of the 
fi  ndings may also be of relevance for over-
coming the euro- area debt crisis. The ex-
amples of historical private sector debt cri-
ses chosen are those of Norway, Finland, 
Sweden and Japan, who pursued different 
strategies in dealing with the crises that 
started between the end of the 1980s and 
the early 1990s.
At the end of the 1980s, the aforemen-tioned countries experienced both credit 
bubbles and asset price bubbles, unleashed, 
in particular, by the fi  nancial market de-regulation ongoing since the 1970s and comparatively favourable fi  nancing condi-tions. Private sector debt, which was no longer sustainable in the end, eventually helped to cause the respective bubbles to burst. The result was a debt crisis in each 
case, sometimes with severe consequences for the real economy.
1
In Japan, indebtedness in connection with 
the real estate and share price boom was particularly high among non- fi  nancial cor-porations while, in the Nordic countries, 
households were also hit hard owing to the 
bubble in the real estate market. Sectoral 
debt ratios in the Nordic economies began 
to decline at the latest one year after the 
onset of the crisis and continued to de-
crease over a number of years. By contrast, 
the corporate debt ratio in Japan did not 
start to fall discernibly until fi  ve years after 
the crisis broke out and, even then, only 
relatively slowly.The debt crises set in when a number of 
banks (including savings banks, especially in 
Norway and Finland) became insolvent. The 
Nordic central banks managed to prevent the interbank markets from drying up by using emergency liquidity assistance and the banking system from collapsing with 
the help of foreign currency deposits (or, in Finland’s case, also capital aid). The Norwe-gian central bank, in particular, had already 
been providing some banks with increased 
liquidity support since the mid-1980s. 
Moreover, the banks’ own collective guar-
antee funds, which were superseded by the 
Government Bank Insurance Fund in 1991, 
also helped to rescue Norway’s banks. In Finland and Sweden, the government is-sued blanket guarantees for banks’ liabil-
ities (excluding equity).
Once the immediate threat to the fi  nancial 
system had been warded off in this way, 
the Nordic states swiftly (in the case of Fin-
land and Sweden, only one year after the 
outbreak of the crisis) proceeded to provide 
ailing fi  nancial institutions with extensive 
capital and loans so as to enable them to repair their balance sheets. A key element in this respect was the conditionality at-tached to the government assistance pro-vided, including the replacement of the 
management and board of directors, write- 
downs of shareholders’ stakes (only par-
tially in Sweden and Finland), mergers with

other banks and the removal of distressed 
assets from banks’ balance sheets. In Swe-
den and Finland, government- owned “bad 
banks” or asset management companies 
were set up for this purpose. These meas-
ures, combined with improved price com-
petitiveness (inter alia in connection with exchange rate adjustments), signifi  cant 
nominal interest rate cuts and productivity- 
enhancing structural reforms, helped to provide the economy with growth stimuli 
– principally via exports – and, at the same 
time, enabled the banks to generate profi  ts 
again. The private sector was thus able to 
reduce its debt ratios without plunging the 
real economy into a protracted crisis.
Policymakers in Japan, by contrast, at fi  rst did not consider the initial liquidity bottle-
necks suffered by individual banks after the bubble burst to be a threat to the fi  nancial 
system or the real economy, especially as 
economic growth − although subdued − re-
mained positive. They consequently 
adopted a “wait- and- see” attitude and ini-
tially took no measures to resolve the crisis. 
There were many cases of solvent banks 
shoring up insolvent institutions and some-
times taking them over in a bid to avert a 
risk to the banking system and, thus, to en-
sure their own survival. However, a sus-
tained recovery of the real economy failed 
to materialise and the situation in the fi  nan-
cial market eventually became acute once 
more, leading not only to the insolvency of several securities houses active in the inter-bank market but also the collapse of some 
large banks. In 1997, these developments 
fi  nally resulted in a real economic contrac-
tion. The Bank of Japan responded by mak-
ing liquidity available on a large scale. In addition, the government provided capital support, but non- performing loans were 
still written off rather slowly, as in previous 
years. The survival of many banks, there-fore, hinged solely on the liquidity and  capital assistance extended by the govern-
ment.
Eight years after the share price bubble burst, a government- owned “bad bank” was set up and several banks were fi  nally comprehensively recapitalised, enabling 
them to write off losses (also through bail-ing in private investors) and repair their bal-
ance sheets. However, holdings of dis-
tressed assets had already become so sub-
stantial that these write- downs eroded 
banks’ capital and placed a renewed con-
siderable strain on their balance sheets. As 
a result, the banks reduced their credit sup-
ply which, together with the high delever-
aging needs of non- fi  nancial corporations, 
dampened aggregate demand. Despite suc-
cessive nominal interest rate cuts and vari-
ous economic stimulus programmes, the 
Japanese economy slipped into a balance sheet recession,
2 which counteracted the 
debt ratio reductions achieved.
The experiences of these countries are com-
parable with the situation in the euro area 
only to a limited extent: in particular, mem-
bership of a monetary union with a single 
stability- oriented monetary policy already 
implies important differences in the eco-
nomic policy and general economic frame-
work. Nevertheless, the examples con-sidered show that essential balance sheet 
corrections in the private sector and, in par-ticular, in the banking system, ie the restruc-turing or revaluation of impaired loans and 
an adequate capitalisation of banks, can 
give key support to the adjustment process 
towards a sustainable economic recovery 
and should, therefore, not be dragged out.

tainable recovery will be (see the box on 
pages 63 and 64).23 On the one hand, a highly 
accommodative monetary policy stance can 
help to avoid downside risks affecting product 
prices, which is consistent with the mandate of 
safeguarding price stability, although the single 
monetary policy has to be geared to the euro 
area as a whole rather than to individual coun -
tries. On the other hand, there is always a dan -
ger that, in the medium term, accommodative 
monetary policy will delay the necessary adjust -
ment process by papering over the underlying 
balance sheet problems in the non- financial 
and financial private sectors and reducing the 
incentives to tackle them consistently. All in all, 
the economy would then be left more vulner -
able to future macroeconomic shocks.24
Monetary policy cannot, therefore, solve the 
debt crisis. That is the responsibility of other 
policy spheres – especially national economic 
policy, which should not only entail structural 
reforms to improve supply conditions in gen -
eral and thus boost growth (see pages  19 
to 37) but must also ensure that risks stemming 
from sectoral debt overhang are tackled quickly. 
Action is needed, for example, in cases where 
the existing legal framework causes unneces -
sary delays in the restructuring or liquidation of 
businesses or in household bankruptcy pro -
ceedings, or makes it difficult to achieve high 
asset recovery ratios. Some euro- area countries 
have already pressed ahead with measures to 
that effect since the financial crisis broke out.25
Above all, creditors – especially banks – must 
be robust enough to withstand any necessary 
value adjustments or write- downs on their 
assets, the key prerequisite for this being ad -
equate capitalisation of the banking sector.26 
To bolster confidence in the stability of the vari -
ous banking systems, it will be vital to ensure that the CA ahead of the SSM’s launch gives a 
conservative assessment of the value of exist -
ing claims, to rapidly cover any deficits de -
tected at institutions with a sustainable busi -
ness model and to have adequate buffers in 
place for existing risks. This should be achieved 
without government aid wherever possible, ie 
by tapping the capital markets and, if neces -
sary, bailing in current creditors and sharehold -
ers. This will reinforce the market economy 
principle of prohibiting bail-outs, thus increas -
ing an awareness of risk in future investment 
decisions and reducing the danger of future 
imbalances. In addition, it is important to avoid 
burdening government budgets any further 
given that they are already strained in many 
countries. Even in tough macroeconomic con -
ditions, consolidating public finances is key in 
order to rapidly reduce the uncertainty sur -
rounding national public finances and to regain 
some leeway for stabilising national financial 
markets (see pages 39 to 52). As a last resort, 
member states with any unmet recapitalisation 
needs will be able to obtain additional funds 
from the European Stability Mechanism 
through a financial assistance programme. This 
option will ensure that, in cases where govern -
ment support is also needed, insufficient fiscal 
policy leeway is not cited as a justification for 
avoiding necessary balance sheet repair and 
structural adjustments in the banking system.Need for struc-

Reduction of cross- border  
financial vulnerabilities
The financial crisis has greatly sharpened market participants’ risk awareness, with the result that 
external developments involving euro-  area member countries are also being evaluated from a 
wholly new perspective. In the run- up to the financial crisis, the growing gap between different 
countries’ current account balances was widely considered part and parcel of a speedy and suc -
cessful convergence process, and funding shortages on the part of individual member states were 
deemed unthinkable. However, as the financial and economic crisis swept across the euro area, 
some member countries’ external positions proved unsustainable. Partly as a result of the in some 
cases extremely high levels of net external debt, the dramatic loss of confidence on the part of 
domestic and foreign investors meant that current account deficits in a number of member states 
were no longer accompanied by adequate private capital flows, and maturing debt could no 
longer always be refinanced.
The international assistance programmes coupled with generous Eurosystem lending prevented 
the banking and balance of payments crisis from escalating and causing bank failures, an abrupt 
reduction of current account deficits and the even harsher real economic adjustments that this 
would have entailed in the affected countries. Ultimately, however, balance of payments pos -
itions must be financed by private capital flows. This depends on the macroeconomic and polit -
ical outlook, in particular, proving stable and thus promising favourable investment conditions so 
as to restore confidence in the solvency of the government and the private sector. Given the acute 
uncertainty on the international financial markets, an improvement in countries’ net external 
asset positions still appears necessary. For this to succeed, current account balances first need to 
revert to sustainable levels, and there are first signs that this is happening.
The necessary structural adjustments in the euro area hinge on responsible policymaking by indi -
vidual countries in a manner that is consistent with the ground rules of the monetary union, 
adequate capitalisation of national banking systems and intensified oversight and supervision 
along with a greater emphasis on risk- appropriate differentiation of investment behaviour. Given 
that there are structures inherent to the system which tend to obstruct the reduction of external 
imbalances on account of the euro area’s single monetary policy, this is key to a sustainable mon -
etary union.Deutsche Bundesbank

External debt remains high
Virtually all of the periphery countries initially 
recorded declining current account deficits fol -
lowing the onset of the international financial 
crisis in the third quarter of 2008 and the eco -
nomic slump which then followed. The current 
account balances of many countries have now 
returned to a surplus (see pages 19 to 37). In 
most countries, this development has led to a 
marked slowdown in the deterioration in the 
net external asset position.1 Cyprus is an excep -
tion to this trend, as its net external asset pos -
ition did not shift to a deficit until 2008, after 
which it quickly widened, however; likewise 
Ireland’s net external debt continued to grow 
sharply after 2007. However, given a decline in 
nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in some 
countries, most countries have, in the course of 
the crisis, recorded widening international in -
vestment position deficits in relation to their 
GDP (see chart below). In the second quarter of 
2013, these deficits ranged between 28% and 118% of GDP for Italy and Portugal respectively. 
During the crisis, the volume of both external 
claims and external liabilities continued to grow 
in some countries, albeit at a much slower pace 
than in the period before the start of the inter -
national financial crisis. However, develop -
ments varied greatly depending on the individ -
ual sector and investment instrument.
As a consequence of the financial crisis and the 
tighter regulation which it has helped bring 
about, cross- border positions have been ad -
justed and scaled back on a worldwide basis, 
especially in the banking sector. This develop -
ment is also discernible in the international in -
vestment positions of most of the periphery 
countries where, in the years preceding the cri -
sis, banks had increasingly raised funds from 
abroad during credit-fuelled economic upturns. 
The banking sector accounts for a considerable 
proportion of external debt and, with the ex -
ception of Ireland, the banking sector is re -
sponsible for more than half of private sector 
external liabilities in all of the countries under 
observation. Nevertheless, since the emergence 
of the European debt crisis monetary financial 
institutions (MFIs) have generally reduced their 
claims on the rest of the world, while simultan -
eously recording a decline in their liabilities. In 
particular, they have pared down their holdings 
of foreign securities and of cross- border loans. 
In Greece, the asset-  side trend deviated from 
this pattern quite starkly on occasion, as Greek 
banks held notably larger stocks of foreign 
debt securities in their portfolios at the end of 
the second quarter of 2013 than at year- end 
2010. This is mainly due to the recapitalisation 
of credit institutions using European Financial 
Stability Facility (EFSF) bonds.
Beside reflecting changes in the banking sec -
tor’s international exposure, periphery coun -
tries’ international investment positions also 
mirror structural shifts which can only be ex -Net external

sources like those that are available in the mon -
etary union through the European Stability 
Mechanism (ESM), the EFSF and other mechan -
isms have gained in importance. The role they 
play is also evident in gross foreign debt.2
In the majority of countries, banking sector ex -
ternal liabilities as a share of gross foreign debt 
have contracted sharply since mid-2008, 
whereas governments’ debt to non- residents 
has risen. At the end of the second quarter of 
2013, the Greek government’s foreign debt 
stood at 141% of GDP , almost twice as high as 
in mid-2010, shortly after the sovereign debt 
crisis set in. The increase was largely due to 
international assistance loans, while the vol -
ume of Greek government bonds held by non- 
residents has shrunk to around one- quarter of 
its level in mid-2008.3 This is a reflection of the 
haircut, the debt buyback programme and the 
Greek government’s difficulties in placing bonds in foreign markets. In Portugal and Ire -
land, too, the government’s external debt 
reached particularly high levels in the second 
quarter of 2013 compared with other periphery 
countries, of 86% and 80% of GDP respect -
ively.
Moreover, since the start of the global financial 
crisis, central banks of periphery countries, too, 
have held larger volumes of external liabilities. 
These chiefly constitute TARGET2 liabilities, 
holdings of which were usually only temporary 
and small prior to the crisis.4 In light of the in -

2 A country’s gross foreign debt is calculated as the foreign 
assets stated in the international investment position minus 
the equity components; in other words, it constitutes that 
part of a country’s debt that is subject to (re)payment obli -
gations.
3 At the end of the second quarter of 2013, the Greek 
government’s unsecuritised debt constituted around half 
the country’s foreign liabilities, as opposed to mid-2008 
when it accounted for less than 3%.

the public sector’s share of periphery countries’ 
external debt has thus increased, while the 
share of market-  driven external debt has de -
creased by comparison (see the chart on 
page  69).5 For this situation to be reversed, 
progress needs to be made in eliminating the 
root causes of the crisis in member states and 
in the institutional framework of monetary 
union.
Tentative recovery of capital 
flows and their structure6
As a rule, adjustment progress is reflected more 
quickly in balance of payments flows than in 
international investment position stock vari -
ables. The balance of payments imbalance 
which set in at the start of the debt crisis in the 
first quarter of 2010 and the concomitant (pri -
vate) external funding gap in some euro-  ar ea 
countries have been contracting since mid-2012. This can be seen inter alia  in TARGET2 
liabilities, which have been in decline since 
peaking in the middle of 2012. The sum total of 
TARGET2 liabilities in the periphery countries 
under observation fell by 37% from the end of 
the second quarter of 2012 to just under €610 
billion at the end of 2013.
However, as when interpreting lower current account balances, a purely net assessment of 
monetary balance of payments adjustment 
does not allow any final conclusions to be 
drawn about the underlying adjustment pro -
cesses. To answer this question, it is necessary 
to look at trends in gross capital flows, as their 
breakdown by investment instrument and in -
vestor is key to the stability of financial oper -
ations with non-  r esidents.
The declining portfolio flows recorded in 2008 
and 2009 are primarily attributable to invest -
ors’ growing risk awareness with respect to 
shares and mutual fund shares, while the euro area initially continued to be regarded as a safe 
haven in terms of government bonds. This changed only when a Greek government de -fault looked imminent. Suddenly, foreign cred -
itors were predominantly worried not only 
about the soundness of commercial banks but also about the possibility of governments prov -
ing unable to meet their financial obligations. 
In spring 2012, this development reached its 
zenith when private creditors were involved in 
efforts to combat the Greek debt crisis through 
a restructuring of outstanding government 
debt.
The recovery in capital inflows witnessed from 
the third quarter of 2012 onwards was broadly 
confined to portfolio investment. There are 
likewise signs of a slight revival in direct invest -
ment. Compared with the momentum ex -
hibited by other forms of capital transaction, 
however, this form of investment responded relatively sluggishly throughout the crisis. By 
contrast, foreign commercial banks continue to 
withdraw funds from the periphery countries in 
their (unsecuritised) lending operations.
The reason for the structural shift within the 
reviving capital flows away from bank financing 
is only partially to be found in the recipient 
countries themselves where, notwithstanding 
first signs of improvement, the economic out-
look continues to be dominated by the struc -
tural adjustment process and banks are in some 
cases still deemed to be vulnerable. Another 
factor is that, since 2008, foreign commercial Modest recovery

5 In Ireland, the decrease in external debt in the banking 
sector was accompanied by an increase in external liabil -
ities in other sectors, including non-  b ank financial sector 
enterprises. The external liabilities of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Ireland’s bad bank estab -
lished in September 2009, onto which Irish banks have off -
loaded large quantities of non-  performing loans, ar e also 
recorded under this item. When considering the very high 
levels of gross external debt in Ireland, the special role 
played by the financial industry must be borne in mind. The total figure reflects its outstanding liabilities, but it also has 
large-  scale claims on the rest of the world.
6 In the text below, the terms “private capital flows” and 
“private financial flows” are used interchangeably and refer 
to capital inflows and outflows excluding transfers exe -
cuted under international assistance programmes and ex -
cluding changes in national central banks’ claims on or 
liabil ities to the ECB (T ARGET2). As the capital flow data 
available for Cyprus is less up-  to-  date than that for the 
other countries, the country will not be dealt with in any 
depth in this section.Deutsche Bundesbank

banks have continuously scaled back their ex -
posure to countries outside their core business 
area, thus rendering them very cautious in their 
dealings with periphery countries. This reorien -
tation is, in part, a reaction to the new capital 
rules introduced under Basel III as well as to 
conditions imposed by the European Commis -
sion in connection with state aid procedures 
(see also pages 53 to 65 on the subject of pri -
vate debt).
On the whole, market participants’ confidence 
in a stabilisation of the financial markets has 
undoubtedly increased since mid-2012. This 
was in no small measure due to anticipation of 
greater euro- area integration based on deci -
sions relating to the banking union and the de -
cision by the Governing Council of the ECB to 
carry out open market transactions (OMT), sub -
ject to certain conditions. Against this back -
drop, government bond prices rose and there 
were inflows of funds to this investment cat -
egory from the rest of the world in the remain -der of the year. The successful placement of 
government bonds on the primary market in 
Spain, Italy and Portugal further testifies to 
market participants’ willingness to provide gov -
ernments with private funds again. It should be 
borne in mind, however, that a substantial part 
of the demand derives from domestic banks, 
which creates its own problems.7
Foreign investors’ tendency to invest not just in 
paper issued by governments and financial in -
stitutions but increasingly in shares of non-  
financial corporations as well is the first indica -
tion that the structure of capital flows is begin -
ning to return to more normal levels. Some 
countries (Portugal and Spain, mainly) are also 
seeing enterprises themselves adapting their 
funding behaviour and pushing ahead with the 
issue of corporate bonds in response to the still Government

subdued supply of credit from commercial 
banks. This new stance is certainly a welcome 
development on the whole, because it makes 
enterprises less reliant on commercial banks 
and is likely to go hand in hand with a broad 
shift towards liabilities with longer maturities. 
Both these factors would help to reduce the 
risk of financing constraints.
As far as German investors’ behaviour is con -
cerned, the Bundesbank’s statistics on secur -
ities investments show that both banks and 
non- banks (which include insurers and invest -
ment companies) withdrew portfolio invest -
ments from the periphery countries in 2010 
and 2011. While German commercial banks’ 
portfolio investment abroad has remained 
muted, much like their lending, non- banks 
– notably money market funds and other non- 
monetary financial institutions – have also been 
investing in bonds from southern Europe (pri -
marily Italy and Spain) again of late.Unlike public sector institutions, these institu -
tional investors are likely to attach major im -
portance to the search for yield, particularly so 
in the prevailing low- interest- rate environment. 
Even so, the upturn in private capital flows sug -
gests that investors are increasingly confident 
that progress is being made in overcoming the 
European debt crisis.

The pattern of capital flows into the countries 
hardest hit by the European debt crisis outlined 
in this article contains two notable outliers: 
Greece and Ireland. Greece is still largely cut off 
from the international capital markets. While it

able to the disbursement of further instalments 
from the EU and IMF assistance programmes. 
These payments are the reason why Greece has 
been able to pay down its external liabilities.8 
So if anything, only the narrower current ac -
count deficit offers any real indication that 
Greece’s external situation is easing.
Ireland, on the other hand, appears to have 
been rather more successful in convincing the 
international capital markets that it has re -
turned to a sustainable growth path, judging 
by the upturn in foreign demand for Irish equi -
ties since the third quarter of 2012. Added to 
this, the first two quarters of 2013 saw Ireland 
attracting renewed capital inflows from private 
commercial banks. Hence, Ireland is once again 
generating gross capital inflows across all in -
vestment categories. The EU/IMF assistance 
programmes expired in December last year 
upon acceptance of the final report by the 
European Commission.
Yet the Irish economy remains heavily biased 
towards the financial sector. A more diversified 
economic base would certainly be welcome in 
that it would reduce the country’s external vul -
nerabilities. Since the second quarter of 2012, 
the country’s current account surpluses have 
been accompanied not just by a steady con -
traction in the Irish central bank’s TARGET2 
liabil ities to the ECB but also by increased scope 
for Irish investment abroad, with long- term 
bonds as well as foreign shares and mutual 
fund shares proving to be particularly attract -
ive.9
For all the differences between Portugal and 
Spain’s starting positions and the challenges 
they continue to face, recent developments in 
both countries have nonetheless been consist -
ent with the broad pattern of easing external 
tension, with foreign investors drifting back 
into the local capital markets since the second 
quarter of 2012 and also allocating funds to 
the private sector. Portugal’s progress owes 
something to its privatisation programme, 
which included the sale of two public utilities and an airport operator, amongst other things, 
to foreign investors.
Spain, meanwhile, is a different proposition be -
cause the ESM funds of just over €41 billion 
flowed not into the general government 
budget but to the Spanish Fund for Orderly 
Bank Restructuring (Fondo de Reestructuración 
Ordenada Bancaria, or FROB) in the form of 
bonds. These securities were used to recapital -
ise distressed commercial banks and thus help 
to keep them afloat. The paper is also eligible 
as collateral for refinancing operations, some 
of which are conducted across national borders 
and ultimately also generate higher private 
capital inflows from abroad. The financial as -

Assessment of  
external adjustments
So all in all, some external adjustment efforts 
have made more progress than others. On a 
positive note, foreign private investors have re -
turned to most of the periphery, which is par -
tially reflected in the decline in TARGET2 liabil -
ities, although these figures remain high in ab -
solute terms. On the downside, demand in 
most countries continues to centre around 
government securities, which benefit in a spe -
cial way from guarantees given explicitly or im -
plicitly by international lenders – their perform -
ance is driven not just by expectations regard -
ing the issuer’s economic prospects but also by 
the growing mutualisation of liability risk 
brought about by a raft of crisis measures.
Time and again, the Eurosystem’s non- standard 
monetary policy measures and the European 
Union’s financial assistance have had a stabilis -
ing effect on the periphery countries in recent 
years. However, lasting progress in adjusting 
external imbalances is conditional on repaying 
the capital received through such interventions. 
This is all the more the case when one con -siders that such assistance potentially reduces 
the pressure on them to implement necessary 
(external) adjustments, meaning that structural 
changes might even be delayed.
The availability of external assistance and in -
creased drawdowns of central bank financing 
are not the only factors at play here. Structures 
hardwired into the euro area’s framework like -
wise hinder the reduction of external imbal -
ances within the monetary union. Bundesbank 
research has found that balance of payments 
adjustment mechanisms in a number of euro-  
area countries are fundamentally different from 
those in other exchange rate regimes.10 Vari-
ations are particularly apparent when com -
pared with economies that have floating ex -
change rates. Yet a comparison with other 
fixed exchange rate regimes likewise confirms 
that a common monetary policy that is geared 
to developments in the currency area as a 
whole means that there is no separate inter -
action between the monetary base and current 
and net financial transactions in individual parts 
of the common currency area. Instead, a re -

higher in the event of external funding gaps – 
is prevented initially.
Countries with traditional fixed exchange rate 
regimes usually attempt to hedge against a 
 abrupt large- scale exodus of capital or a sud -
den stop in capital inflows from abroad by 
building up national currency reserves. In the 
euro area, the Eurosystem’s provision of liquid -
ity at uniform terms dampens any interest rate 
response and swift adjustment in the real econ -
omy. A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) model can be used to simulate the spe -
cific impact of unexpected and abrupt capital 
outflows on various exchange rate regimes. 
The results confirm that the adjustment process 
is protracted in a monetary union, with the de -
cline in private consumption and GDP , in par -
ticular, being less pronounced than in a fixed 
exchange rate regime (see the box on pages 76 
to 78). In a similar vein, joint financing institu -
tions such as the ESM, which certainly play a 
worthwhile role from a financial stability per -
spective, run counter to the notion that risk 
provisioning is a matter of national responsibil -
ity, and might reduce the pressure on individual 
countries to make adjustments.
Yet this is a defining feature of any monetary 
union and thus of the euro area as well: the 
idea is to render expensive, ergo inefficient 
hedges against internal currency crises super -
fluous, while simultaneously reaping the bene -
fits of both stable external prices between the 
member states and a common financial mar -
ket. An integral component of any monetary 
union is a single monetary policy – one whose 
mutualised balance sheet risks need to be cur -
tailed through the risk- appropriate collateralisa -
tion of monetary policy operations and by con -
fining operations to financially sound counter -
parties. That is why any efforts to prevent crises 
and appropriately reform European Monetary 
Union need to focus primarily on measures de -
signed to promptly detect and prevent macro -
economic risk without undermining the basic 
principle of a monetary union.Against this backdrop, it would appear essen -
tial to step up the pace of structural adjustment 
in the euro area. The onus here is primarily on 
the individual programme countries, which 
have pledged to implement reforms under the 
terms of the assistance programmes. But the 
same can be said for the framework of monet -
ary union. Strict banking oversight by the  Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) coupled with an 
effective resolution regime for insolvent institu -
tions are key building blocks of a more stable 
monetary union. The macroeconomic imbal -
ances procedure (MIP) is another mechanism 
associated with the stabilisation of external im -
balances.11
Responsible policymaking by individual coun -
tries in a manner that is consistent with the 
ground rules of the monetary union, and a 
greater emphasis on risk- appropriate differenti -
ation of investment behaviour within the euro 
area thus represent pivotal elements of the 
structural adjustments that need to be adminis -
tered. This is one of the cornerstones of a sus -
tainable monetary union, given that it was the 
large- scale harmonisation of capital costs in a 
manner which turned a blind eye to fundamen -
tal differences between recipient countries and 
thus overshot the intended and desirable target 
of deeper financial integration which contrib -
uted substantially to mounting external imbal -
ances up to 2007. Investors now appear to be 
more aware of this situation, if the regional 
and sectoral composition of capital flows and 
the preferred forms of investment are anything 
to go by.
The fact that investors are now making a 
clearer distinction between the euro- area coun -
tries – as reflected by interest rate spreads that 
are wider than before the crisis  – essentially 
marks a step in the right direction. Yet what it 
also implies is that interest rate spreads across

Simulated adjustment processes following 
a capital outfl  ow shock
Adjustment processes to external changes 
(shocks) that depend on the exchange rate 
regime can be examined using a dynamic 
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. Simulations with a DSGE model 
used by the Bundesbank are outlined below 
for two hypothetical situations. We con-sider a country that is either in monetary 
union or is trying to peg its exchange rate 
to the monetary union.
The Bundesbank’s DSGE model is a multi- 
country model of the euro area in the global economy. The euro area itself is divided into 
two regions or countries. Each country is 
modelled as an economy which consists of households, fi  rms and a public sector. While 
the public sector acts in accordance with 
pre- defi  ned rules of conduct, the behaviour 
of households and fi  rms is determined en-
dogenously as a result of utility and profi  t maximisation. Households, for example, 
plan their consumption and their supply of 
labour such that they extract from it the 
greatest utility; this makes it possible to de-rive savings decisions and therefore macro-economic capital accumulation. Firms try to 
maximise their profi  ts through their deci-
sions on output and the demand for capital and labour, by means of which they also set 
the prices for their products. Wages and prices are determined in the presence of monopolistic competition. The countries 
are interconnected with each other and the 
rest of the world externally through goods 
trade and fi  nancial assets, in particular se-
curities.
In a fl  oating exchange rate regime, monet-
ary policy is determined by a rule of con-
duct according to which the policy rate de-
pends on the infl  ation rate and on what is 
known as the output gap.1 As a result, the 
policy rate increases when the infl  ation rate 
surpasses the central bank’s infl  ation target 
or when the output gap is positive. In a 
monetary union, the member states’ central 
banks have relinquished control over the policy rate; instead, independent single monetary policy responds to the member states’ average infl  ation rate and average 
output gap. In the alternative scenario – ie 
an exchange rate peg of a country that is not in monetary union – the central bank 
pegs the value of its own currency through purchases or sales on the foreign exchange 
market. Hence, national infl  ation and the 
output gap are no longer taken into consid-eration in this fi  xed exchange rate regime.
The scenario that is analysed below com-
prises an unexpected “capital outfl  ow 
shock”, in which international investors 
withdraw fi  nancial capital from a country. In the Bundesbank’s DSGE model, this is mod-
elled in such a way that the relative return 
on bonds issued in the domestic market, which is assumed to be small, will initially 
deteriorate by one percentage point.2 As a 
result, these securities become less attract-
ive to international investors. One possible 
reason for the decline in attractiveness 
could be excessive debt, which is associated with too high a risk in terms of holding gov-
ernment bonds. The question is whether 
monetary union as opposed to an exchange rate peg renders the adjustment process in 
the wake of such a shock easier or more 
diffi   cult. It is otherwise assumed in the 
comparative analysis of the two scenarios 
that the other underlying economic condi-
tions are the same in both countries.
A capital outfl  ow shock makes access to 
the international fi  nancial market more dif-fi  cult in both scenarios, with the effect that – at any given interest rate – fewer fi  nancial resources are available. This shortage causes 
the capital market rate to increase in the 
country in question, which in turn leads to 
1 The output gap is defi  ned as the difference between 
the actual output level and the natural output level, 
excluding price and wage inertia.
2 The capital outfl  ow shock follows an autoregressive 
process both in monetary union and in the case of a 
currency peg. Owing to its autoregressive features and 
the shock’s assumed persistence, the half- life of the 
capital outfl  ow shock is fi  ve quarters.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

an increase in domestic savings and a de-
crease in the domestic demand for capital. 
As a result, there is a decline in both con-
sumption and investment and therefore 
also in aggregate demand and in produc-
tion. The extent of this adjustment depends on the exchange rate regime, however.
The above chart illustrates the adjustment 
process of the economy in question in the 
two scenarios. It shows the dynamic adjust-
ment of the domestic capital market rate, consumption, the real wage, the real ex-
change rate level of the country vis- à- vis the 
rest of the world (ROW), gross domestic 
product (GDP) and net external assets over 
a period of 20 quarters (ie fi  ve years); the 
deviation of the variable in question from its 
long- term equilibrium is depicted in each case. Correspondingly, the zero line illus-
trates the case where there is no deviation from the long- term equilibrium.
In the case of a membership in monetary 
union, the domestic capital market rate in-creases to a lesser extent than in a fi  xed ex-change rate regime (see chart above). This 
is owed to the fact that the monetary un-
ion’s central bank counterbalances reces-
sionary trends which, due to a capital out-
fl  ow shock in one member state, also have an – albeit weaker – impact on the average of the union as a whole. In the case of the 
fi  xed exchange rate, the adjustment must be borne in full by the directly affected 
country itself. The central bank must focus 
its monetary policy on pegging the ex-
change rate, whereas the monetary union’s 
monetary policy is geared towards the 
member states’ macroeconomic interests.
Given that the increase in the domestic cap-
ital market rate is less pronounced in the 
context of a capital outfl  ow shock in monet-
ary union, a decrease in consumption, too, 
is weaker  – at least initially. In the DSGE 
model outlined here, the households in monetary union are willing to reduce their 
supply of labour to a lesser extent, with the 
consequence that the real wage declines Simulated adjustment processes in the event of unexpected capital outflows*

ceded and the international financial markets 
have returned to more stable levels, if those 
spreads are backed up by fundamentals. Such 
spreads would not be proof of a lack of inte -
gration but represent an acceptable, if not to say highly desirable state of affairs which re -
affirms the central role played by individual 
 national responsibility within the euro area’s 
regulatory framework.more strongly.3 This is also refl  ected in a 
relatively pronounced depreciation in the 
real exchange rate. In the context of monet-
ary union membership, both factors lead to 
a relative improvement in competitiveness 
and – besides the relatively moderate rise in 
interest rates – therefore also contribute to 
keeping the decline in GDP in check.4 In 
addition, in monetary union the smaller in-
crease in the domestic capital market rate 
and the weaker decline in consumption go 
hand in hand with lower savings. In connec-tion with an also relatively moderate decline in investment, existing current account def-icits are reduced at a slower pace in the con-text of a monetary union compared with an exchange rate peg, and current account sur-
pluses tend to be achieved with a lag. This 
ultimately gives rise to a weaker increase in net external assets.
Overall, the results illustrate that the adjust-
ment path of the small country’s economy 
is less volatile if it is a member of monetary 
union than if its exchange rate is pegged. This is particularly evident when comparing 
consumption and GDP .
3 Owing to the capital outfl  ow shock, a shortage of 
fi  nancial resources occurs in both scenarios. However, 
membership in monetary union guarantees a less pro-nounced rise in the domestic capital market rate, with 
the effect that households are willing to reduce their 
consumption to a lesser degree than would be the case in an exchange rate peg. In order for this rela-
tively small decline in consumption to actually materi-alise in monetary union, households opt to reduce the supply of labour to a lesser extent. Compared to a situ-
ation with an exchange rate peg, this enables them –  despite a stronger decline in the real wage  – to 
achieve greater labour income on the whole, thereby 
also fi  nancing the relatively higher consumption.4 The link between a relatively strong decrease in the 
wage level and a comparatively moderate decline in 
consumption in a monetary union shows clearly that a common currency does in fact offer advantages in the 
event of a capital outfl  ow shock. In reality, responses 
may differ across countries, which can be attributed to structural differences in these countries, eg in the ad-
justment capacity of the labour markets. The analysis 
of the above scenarios focuses on fundamental links 
and disregards such structural differences. The import-ance of fl  exible labour markets in monetary union is a 
key fi  nding of the theory of optimum currency areas. 
By contrast, labour market rigidities can cancel out the advantages of monetary union.Deutsche Bundesbank

8Less German MFIs’ holdings of paper issued by euro-area MFIs. 9Including money stocks M1, M2 or M3. 11The difference between the volume of euro
national banknotes still in circulation. 10The German contributions to the Euro- banknotes actually issued by the Bundesbank and the amount disclosed in
system’s monetary aggregates should on no account be interpreted as national accordance with the accounting regime chosen by the Eurosystem (see also footnote
monetary aggregates and are therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German 2 on banknote circulation in Table III.2).
