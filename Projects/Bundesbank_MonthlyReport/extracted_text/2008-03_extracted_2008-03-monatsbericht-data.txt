5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeThe growth of the German economy was no
more than moderate in the fourth quarter of2007. Real GDP went up by a seasonally andcalendar-adjusted 0.3% following an in-crease of 0.7% in the third quarter. Thisrepresents a calendar-adjusted rise of 1.8%on the year. The main reason for the moder-ate pace of growth was a 0.5% quarter-on-quarter decline in domestic demand in sea-sonal and calendar-adjusted terms.
There was a perceptible decline in private
consumption in the fourth quarter due tosurges in energy and food prices. Not onlydid the rise in prices have a direct negativeeffect on consumers’ purchasing power, italso dampened their propensity to purchaseas a result of the heightened uncertainty re-garding price expectations. This was reflect-ed, not least, by the fact that the saving ratiowent up by
1/C252percentage point to 11.2% in
seasonally adjusted terms. While constructioninvestment also declined, enterprises investedquite strongly in machinery and equipment.One reason for this is likely to have been that,with the implementation of the new businesstax as of 1 January 2008, the temporarily im-proved depreciation conditions for moveablesno longer applied. Furthermore, at just under
3/C254percentage point, net exports made a
significant contribution to overall economicgrowth in the fourth quarter. It should beborne in mind, however, that this outcome islargely attributable to the slight decline in thevolume of imports, which is reflected notFourth-quarter

6least by weaker domestic demand. Although
exports increased again in the fourth quarter,their quarter-on-quarter growth, at 1.3%,was still comparatively moderate. The valueof exports of goods rose again sharply inJanuary 2008, being 3.8% up on the monthin seasonally adjusted terms. The increase inthe value of imports, at 4.2%, was evensomewhat stronger. Overall, a foreign tradesurplus of just over 316 billion was achieved.
IndustryIndustrial output picked up again at the be-
ginning of the year after increasing discern-ibly in December. Seasonally adjusted indus-trial output in January was 1.9% up on themonth and 7.4% up on the year. In sectoralterms, there was a sharp increase in the pro-duction of capital goods, while producers ofintermediate and consumer goods failed tomatch the rather high level of the previousmonth.
Orders received fell by a seasonally adjusted
1.5% in January after declining by 1.1% inDecember. Given that an exceptional numberof large orders had made an impact in thefourth quarter, the decline in the volume oforders is to be seen more as a return to nor-mal. Even so, the volume of orders in Januarywas 9.5% up on the year.
ConstructionThere was a sharp seasonally adjusted rise of
11.7% in construction output in January.Although the mild weather made a positivecontribution to the result, the main reason isEconomic conditions in Germany*

7likely to have been that a large number of
construction projects were commissioned byboth industrial customers and the public sec-tor in the fourth quarter of 2007. Thus, des-pite the sharp decline in demand for dwell-ings, there was an 8.0% increase in the totalvolume of orders on the third quarter.
Labour marketThe situation in the labour market continued
to improve after the turn of the year. The sea-sonally adjusted number of persons in em-ployment went up by 0.2% in January. Theyear-on-year rise was 1.3%. The increase injobs subject to social security contributionswas even larger. According to estimates bythe Federal Employment Agency, their num-ber in December 2007 was 2.2% up on theyear. By contrast, there was little change inthe volume of government-assisted forms ofemployment, and the number of persons insolely marginal employment has been declin-ing since the third quarter of 2007.
There was a further sharp fall in unemploy-
ment in February. The seasonally adjustedfigure went down by 75,000 to 3.34 millionat present. The fact that the mild weatherresulted in hardly any production losses in theoutdoor occupations may also have played apart in this. The month-on-month unemploy-ment rate fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per-centage point to 8.0%. This represents adecline of 1.6 percentage points on the year.The number of reported job vacancies fellslightly from a high level.Prices
There was a further rise in prices in the inter-
national crude oil markets in February. Theprice of a barrel of Brent crude oil reached anew record high of more than US$100 at theend of the month. As this report went topress, the spot price stood at US$106
1/C252.I nt h e
futures markets, a discount of US$21/C252was
being granted for six-month deliveries; thefigure for 18-month deliveries was US$5
1/C252.
Seasonally adjusted import prices were up
0.6% on the month in January 2008. At thesame time, however, the year-on-year ratewent up from 3.7% in December 2007 to5.2%. This sharp increase is also due to thefact that crude oil was comparatively moder-ately priced at the turn of 2006-07. Excludingenergy, import prices also showed a furtherseasonally adjusted increase; owing to theprice reductions last year, the annual ratestood at just 0.1%. The price of domesticallyproduced industrial goods rose by a seasonal-ly adjusted 0.7% at the beginning of theyear. This represents an increase of 3.3% onJanuary 2007. Excluding energy, the rate ofprice increase, at 2.4%, was not as sharp.
The unfavourable trend in consumer prices
weakened somewhat in the first two monthsof 2008. Prices went up by a seasonally adjust-ed 0.1% in February, compared with 0.2% inJanuary. This was due to a marked rise inenergy prices and further price rises for anumber of food products. According to thenational consumer price index (CPI), year-on-year inflation was 2.8% in both January andFebruary. It was therefore 0.2 percentageEmployment

8point down on the fourth quarter of 2007,
when, calculated in accordance with the newstandard, it stood at 3.0%. Originally, 2.8%had been reported for this period. These revi-sion differences arising from the changeover inthe index are due mainly to food discountersnow having a greater weighting in line withtheir market share and the fact that their pricetrend was very unfavourable in the secondhalf of 2007. The Harmonised Index of Con-sumer Prices (HICP) has not been revised butchain-linked with the new index results inDecember 2007 in accordance with Europeanrequirements. It shows a year-on-year priceincrease of 2.9% in the first two months of2008. On a basis comparable to the CPI, butcalculated using the HICP basket of goods, theincrease would have been larger.

Statutory health insurance scheme
In 2007 the statutory health insurance
scheme recorded a surplus of 32 billion, a
figure close to that of the two previous years.The cut in the Federal grant from 34.2 billion
to32.5 billion and accelerated growth in
expenditure were offset by distinctly higherrevenue from contributions. Overall, bothrevenue and expenditure were up by over4%.
Revenue from contributions recorded sharp
growth of 5
1/C252% which is attributable for the
most part (just over 4%) to the rise in contri-bution rates from an average of 14.2% to14.8%. In addition, the contribution baserose by over 1
1/C254%, which was twice as fast
as in 2006. By comparison, gross wages andsalaries increased by over 3% last year. Thefact that the contribution base fell short ofremuneration as recorded in the national ac-counts is mainly due to two reasons. Firstly,growth in pensions subject to compulsorycontributions lagged considerably behind thecontribution base. Secondly, contributionspaid on behalf of unemployed persons de-creased very sharply as a result of the favour-able labour market situation. However, thewages and salaries of insured persons in em-ployment are likely to have increased almostas strongly as remuneration recorded in thenational accounts.
Spending on pharmaceuticals was a major
factor in the acceleration of expendituregrowth. Spending growth amounted toalmost 7
1/C252% in 2007, approximately one-
third of which is attributable to the rise in thestandard rate of value added tax. However, itis also becoming evident that the statutory
1As of the reporting month of January 2008, the existing
consumer price statistics based on the old 2000 basket of
goods were rebased on the new 2005 basket. Further-
more, an explicit business type weighting has been intro-
duced and the survey period was extended for a range of
products. The consumer price index has been back-calcu-
lated to 2005, which means that the year-on-year figure
for 2008 can be calculated on a comparable basis. Owing
to the chain-linking in December 2007, this is not the
case for the published data on the Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP), however. The most important
difference between the CPI and the HICP baskets of
goods concerns owner-occupied housing. In the CPI, this
is incorporated using equivalent rents, whereas it is not
included in the HICP .

9measures designed to rein in expenditure are
becoming less and less effective. With anincrease of over 4%, spending on out-patienttreatment likewise expanded considerably.This is probably due to a rise in benefits (suchas out-patient operations) not subject tobudget caps. Following five years of decline,payments for sickness benefit increased againfor the first time. Furthermore, clear growthwas recorded in the cost of nursing patientsin their own homes (+10
1/C252%), with a massive
surge in outlays on vaccinations (+71%),which became a mandatory benefit for thestatutory health insurance institutions in April2007. Had it not been for the moderate in-crease in expenditure on hospital in-patienttreatment (+1
1/C252%), which was also dampen-
ed by the flat-rate reductions in paymentrates of 0.5% for hospital treatment thatwere agreed as part of the recent healthcarereform, total expenditure would have goneup by a much greater amount.
After generating a surplus in 2007, the statu-
tory health insurance institutions are likely tohave largely paid off their debts, even if, inexceptional cases and for good reason, indi-vidual institutions have been granted an ex-tension of the deadline until the end of 2008.Many institutions have probably even replen-ished their reserves so plentifully that they arenow back above the statutory minimum ofone-quarter of a month’s expenditure. Thisshould mean that a key prerequisite for thelaunch of the new health insurance fund on1 January 2009 has been fulfilled.
Despite continued marked expenditure
growth, significant rises in the contributionrates are not expected in 2008. Thanks to the
progress achieved in reducing debts and re-plenishing reserves, a surplus similar to thatof the past year will not be required this year.Moreover, the Federal grant will not be cutfurther but will remain at the level of 32.5 bil-
lion, and the continued favourable employ-ment trend should yield additional revenue.In the coming year, significant additional ex-penditure is expected, especially in the areaof out-patient treatment, owing to the re-forms of the remuneration system.

3Owing to budgeting, the price of a benefit has general-
ly been determined up to now ex post. In the future, re-
muneration rates are to be determined ex ante, which
means that extensions of the range of benefits provided
will have a direct effect on the volume of expenditure.
Spending growth is to be curbed by specifying standard

10the health insurance fund will not cause high-
er costs. Additional administrative expend-iture is also likely to be contained as, for ex-ample, the individual institutions will continueto collect the contributions for the timebeing. However, a possible build-up of re-serves by the health insurance fund mayrequire a one-off injection of additionalresources and the adjustment to the riskstructure compensation scheme, which is un-related to the health insurance fund but willtake place simultaneously, could initially entailhigher bureaucracy costs.
Public long-term care insurance schemeA deficit of almost 3
1/C252billion is likely to have
been recorded in 2007 for the public long-term care insurance scheme. The negativebalance has therefore hardly changed com-pared with the previous year (excluding theone-off additional revenue windfall due tobringing forward the transfer date for contri-bution payments). Revenue benefited fromthe positive economic setting although, aswas also the case for the statutory healthinsurance scheme, this revenue growth wascurbed by the declining contributions paid onbehalf of unemployed persons. On the ex-penditure side, the trend away from financialbenefits, in particular those paid to familymembers providing out-patient care for arelative, towards non-financial benefits forout-patient care provided by professional ser-vices or for in-patient care presumably con-tinued. The liquid reserves of the public long-term care insurance scheme probablyamounted to just over 33 billion at the end of
2007.On 1 July 2008, the contribution rate is to be
increased from 1.7% to 1.95% (plus the spe-cial contribution of 0.25% for childless per-sons) as part of the reform of the public long-term care insurance scheme. This is intendedto initially finance the planned extension ofbenefits by dynamising long-term care bene-fit rates
4and providing additional benefits,
such as those for people suffering fromdementia. In the first few years, additionalrevenue should exceed these additionalexpenses. However, in the long term, it isconceivable that the expenditure-boostingfactors (growing number of long-term carecases, rising benefit rates) will outweigh therevenue-boosting factors (rising income levels– yet decreasing number – of contributionpayers in employment). This means that con-tribution rates are bound to rise in future.
Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity on the German bond market
increased notably again in January afterissuers had reduced their capital market debttowards the end of 2007. In the reportingmonth, bonds with a total value of 3143.4
billion were sold on the German market, com-pared with 378.5 billion in December 2007.

4Following discretionary adjustments to the long-term
care benefit rates planned for 1 July 2008, 1 January
2010 and 1 January 2012, the long-term care benefit
rates are to be reviewed every three years from 2014 to
see whether they should be adjusted in line with cumula-
tive price developments. If real wage and salary decreases
occur, then benefit rates are to be adjusted at most in
line with nominal increases in gross wages.Deficit on a par

bonds and notes, German borrowers tappedthe domestic bond market for 317.5 billion.
Sales of foreign debt securities amounted to30.2 billion. Total sales on the German bond
market thus amounted to 317.8 billion in
January.
Credit institutions sold 37.6 billion worth
of debt securities in January after havingredeemed bonds in net terms ( 322.6 billion)
in December. The specialised credit institu-tions, some of which are guaranteed by thegovernment, raised the most on the capitalmarkets ( 310.0 billion), while mortgage
Pfandbriefe were also issued in net terms(33.3 billion). By contrast, the outstanding
volume of public Pfandbriefe, as well as ofother bank debt securities (the terms ofwhich are particularly flexible), went down by35.0 billion and 30.7 billion respectively.
The public sector was once again a net issuer
on the capital market in January, selling 34.4
billion worth of securities. Central govern-ment increased its bond market debt by 35.6
billion, selling two-year Federal Treasury notesand 30-year Federal bonds to the amountsof36.3 billion (net) and 32.6 billion (net)
respectively. In contrast, central governmentredeemed ten-year Bunds in particular ( 32.3
billion net) and, to a lesser extent, Treasurydiscount paper as well as Federal Treasuryfinancing paper and special Federal paper,the latter two of which are primarily aimedat private investors. State governments re-deemed capital market obligations to theamount of 31.1 billion net.In January, German companies issued debt
securities for 35.6 billion net, on balance ex-
clusively in the form of short-term commer-cial paper (CP).
On balance, debt securities on the German
market were purchased exclusively by foreigninvestors in January ( 330.2 billion). German
credit institutions reduced their bond port-folios by a total of 36.0 billion. German non-
banks sold debt securities for 36.4 billion net
and bought foreign bonds for 36.0 billion.

man credit institutions were active as buyers,increasing their share holdings by 317.7 bil-

Mutual fund sharesIn January, domestic mutual funds recorded
outflows of 37.7 billion, of which 36.6 billion
was attributable to specialised funds reservedfor institutional investors. German fundsopen to the public paid 31.1 billion worth of
funds under management back to investors.Equity-based funds ( 32.5 billion) and bond-
based funds ( 30.8 billion) were particularly
affected, as were, to a lesser extent, mixedsecurity-based funds ( 30.2 billion). By con-
trast open-end real estate funds saw sales of31.4 billion. Mixed funds and money market
funds saw total inflows of 30.8 billion and
30.3 billion respectively. German investors
also purchased shares in foreign mutual fundsworth 32.5 billion. On balance, all investor
groups sold mutual fund shares in January:German credit institutions and non-bankssold shares for 32.6 billion and 31.5 billion
respectively, while non-residents sold sharesfor31.0 billion net.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 315.0 billion
in January compared with 316.8 billion in De-
cember 2007. The main reason for this fallwas the marked deterioration in the deficiton invisible current transactions, which com-prise services, income and current transfers.However, the trade surplus, which had previ-ously declined, rose again.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus in January increased by 36.4 billion on
the month to 317.1 billion. After adjustment
for seasonal and calendar variations, it in-creased by 3
1/C254billion to 316 billion. The value
of exported goods went up by 33/C254% while
imports at current prices grew by 41/C254%.
Compared with the average of the final quar-ter in 2007, nominal exports grew by a sea-sonally adjusted 2
3/C254% and imports by 63/C254%;
the price-adjusted increases were 2% and5
1/C252% respectively.
Invisible current transactions ran a deficit of
31.3 billion in January 2008 compared with a
surplus of 36.8 billion in December 2007.
This can be attributed to a deterioration inall three sub-accounts. Current transfersand services again recorded deficits. Theseamounted to 33.5 billion and 31.3 billion re-
spectively compared with surpluses of 30.9
billion and 30.6 billion respectively in Decem-
ber. Net receipts from cross-border incomestood at 33.5 billion, down from 35.3 billion

13In January, cross-border portfolio investment
recorded net capital imports, which, at 314.9
billion, were somewhat below the level forDecember ( 317.9 billion). This was attribut-
able mainly to investment by non-residents inGermany ( 313.7 billion). They invested pri-
marily in German debt securities ( 330.2 bil-
lion) but sold shares ( 315.4 billion). They pur-
chased longer-dated debt instruments frompublic and private issuers ( 320.4 billion) in the
main and also acquired money market paper(39.7 billion). During January, German invest-
ors disposed of a modest amount of foreignsecurities worth 31.2 billion net as opposed
to310.4 billion in the preceding month. In
the process, they sold shares ( 33.9 billion)
and acquired mutual fund shares ( 32.5 bil-
lion). In the area of bonds, sales of euro-denominated bonds issued by non-residentswere broadly offset by purchases of foreigncurrency bonds.
With respect to direct investment, January
saw net capital exports amounting to 310.2
billion (compared with 312.3 billion in the
previous month). German enterprises contrib-uted to this development ( 36.1 billion) by
providing their foreign affiliates with predom-inantly new equity capital ( 34.8 billion). For-
eign direct investors, by contrast, withdrewfunds from Germany in net terms ( 34.1 bil-

15German balance of
payments in 2007German exporters benefited again in
2007 from the fairly sharp growth inworld trade. There was a further sharpincrease, of 8
1/C252%, in export sales of
German goods, even though theappreciation of the euro had led to adeterioration in German enterprises’price competitiveness in sales marketsoutside the euro area. This was alsothe case for exports to the South-EastAsian emerging markets and to China.The increase in the value of importswas perceptibly slower at 5%. This wasdue mainly to lower energy importsowing, above all, to the mild weatherat the beginning of 2007, VAT-relatedanticipatory effects, and losses of pur-chasing power which curbed demand.Overall, the current account surplusrose by 1
1/C252percentage points to 71/C252%
of gross domestic product (GDP).
In line with this, there were large net
capital exports in transactions withnon-residents – principally owing tothe banks’ external transactions aswell as direct investment. However, inportfolio investment, which usuallyresponds very rapidly to changes infinancial market conditions, therewere net inflows of funds as a result ofthe existing uncertainties since mid-2007. Once again, domestic securitiesproved to be a “safe haven” for invest-ible capital.

Starting from a strong position, German ex-
porters were continuing to operate in afavourable international setting in 2007.There was further sharp growth, at 5%, inthe world economy, although momentumwas lost towards the end of the year. Accord-ing to estimates by the OECD, global tradeexpanded by 6
1/C252%, which means that it was
less dynamic than in 2006, but still at a highlevel taking a long-term view. Nevertheless,the appreciation of the euro meant that, fol-lowing a slight improvement in 2006, theprice competitiveness of German enterprisesdeteriorated by 1
1/C252% against major trading
partners.1Despite this, German entreprises’
competitive position was still quite strong in2007. This was one of the reasons for thecontinuing positive underlying trends in boththe German trade balance and currentaccount.
Being well positioned with their range of
goods in the relevant markets, German ex-porters greatly benefited from ongoing vigor-ous growth in the world economy, especiallyfrom buoyant global investment. The volumeof German enterprises’ export orders in 2007was 11
3/C254% up on the year, compared with
+11% in 2006. Such notable success inattracting orders was due, in part, to a largenumber of exceptionally big export contractswhich, experience suggests, are processedover an extended period of time. Sentimentamong German exporters therefore remainedfairly optimistic towards the end of 2007,even though it failed to match the high levelsrecorded in the first half of the year. In 2007,German industry increased the value of its ex-
ports by 8
1/C252% on the year following growth
rates of between 71/C252%a n d1 31/C252% in the
three preceding years.2Given a 13/C254% rise in
export prices, this produces a real increase of6
1/C252%. The increase in export prices was
dampened, not least, by the fact that theprices of imported intermediate goods andraw materials were tending to be subdued bythe appreciation of the euro. Furthermore,the export prices of a number of products, ex-pressed in the currency of the country of sale,are likely to have been kept stable or notincreased by the full amount of the euro’sappreciation. This means that they fell in euroterms or showed only a small increase. Such apricing-to-market strategy helps German ex-porters to contain the loss of market shares,although it does involve losses of profitability(see the article on pages 33-46).
In 2007, German exports again received
strong stimuli from partner countries in theeuro area. At 10
1/C254%, the rise in the value of
exports to other euro-area countries wasmore or less as sharp as in 2006. At the sametime, this growth clearly exceeded that in ex-port sales to non-euro-area countries (7
1/C254%).
This is a reflection, first, of the positive eco-nomic development in the euro area, whichbecame more broadly based last year.Second, the low overall rate of inflation inGermany led to the price competitiveness of

2The growth rate of exports, which is calculated from
the external trade statistics, and – to a lesser extent – the
growth rate of imports of goods, was pushed down-
wards for 2007 because movements of goods in connec-
tion with repair and maintenance work, in accordance
with European and international concepts, have not been

17German exporters showing a further slight
(1%) improvement on that of suppliers in therest of the euro area. German enterprises’ ex-port sales increased in all the euro-area part-ner countries, with especially sharp growth inexports to Spain (15
1/C254%) and Finland
(111/C252%) as well as to France (101/C252%) and the
Netherlands (101/C254%). Exports to France were
favoured by anticipatory effects at the end ofthe year owing to the entry into force of aspecial tax on vehicles with high CO
2emis-
sions on 1 January 2008. The new tax affectsmainly up-market vehicles, a segment of themarket in which German manufacturers arevery heavily represented.
3All in all, German
enterprises were able to further expand theirmarket position within the euro area in 2007.
Despite the marked decline in price competi-
tiveness against competitors outside the euroarea (-4
1/C252%), German exporters were able to
maintain their position in non-euro-area mar-kets overall in 2007, although developmentsdiffered very widely from region to region.Nominal exports to the United States fell by6%, for example. First, the euro’s appreci-ation against the US dollar, averaging morethan 9% in 2007, is likely to have impairedtheir value. Second, growth in US demand forimported goods weakened owing to theslackening pace of economic growth. The fallin the value of German exports to Japan(-5
3/C254%) and Canada (-13/C254%) was also due
mainly to exchange rate movements. By con-trast, the value of exports to the emergingmarkets of South-East Asia went up by 2
1/C254%
and to China by 9%. The appreciation of theeuro against the renminbi in 2007, at 4%,was smaller than that against the US dollar.This reflects the fact that the dollar orienta-
tion of the renminbi has loosened somewhatsince the changeover to a crawling peg in2005. Once again, there was an exceptionallysharp increase in exports to the rapidly ex-panding economies of the new EU member€b n

The sharp growth in exports to Poland, at24
1/C252%, played a major part in this. Exports to
Russia were similarly buoyant (+203/C254%). The
value of exports to the OPEC countries wentup 6
3/C254%.
In 2007, all goods-exporting sectors of indus-
try in Germany benefited from the mostlybuoyant demand in the export markets.
4Ger-
man capital goods manufacturers, which ac-count for almost 44% of the German exportsector, increased their exports by 5%. Manu-facturers of machinery and equipment sold6
3/C254% more of their products abroad. The rise
in automotive industry exports was, in fact,somewhat higher (8
3/C254%), partly on account
of the above-mentioned anticipatory effectsin France at the end of last year. Export earn-ings from information and communicationtechnology (ICT) products were 1
1/C252% down
in nominal terms on 2006, but exports arelikely to have shown a perceptible further risein real terms since the prices of such goods,given sustained marked quality improve-ments, have fallen again considerably.
Producers of consumer goods – accounting
for some 16% of all goods exported – also re-corded quite a high rate of increase (6

19export business. The increase in exports of
intermediate goods, which account for justover 30% of German exports, was almost assharp (6%). First, there was a marked rise inexports of chemical products (7%), whichalso reflects price increases owing to higherenergy costs and the use of petrochemicalinputs. Second, there was a considerableincrease in nominal export sales of metalsand metal products (10
1/C254%). This growth
was almost entirely price-related, however,since the worldwide boom, especially in thesteel market, allowed enterprises to pass onthe markedly higher costs for wages, oresand energy in their sales prices.
Imports of goods rose by 5% in value in
2007, which was nowhere near as sharply asexports of goods. In real terms, the differen-tial in growth compared with exports wassmaller, however, since the rise in the cost ofimports was relatively moderate overall, at1
1/C254%, primarily as a result of the appreciation
of the euro. Higher import prices for rawmaterials and semi-finished goods (+4%) aswell as for intermediate goods (+4
3/C254%) con-
trasted with the 11/C252% fall in the prices of
finished goods. Overall, the terms of tradeincreased by
1/C252% after deteriorating by a
total of 6% in the three preceding years.
Import growth was given a marked boost in
2007 by German enterprises’ demand for im-ported intermediate inputs, which increasedby 6
3/C254%. At the end of the period under
review, this category of goods accounted for30% of total imports. There were exception-ally sharp increases in imports of chemicalproducts (8%) and of metals and metal prod-ucts (13%). Imports of consumer goods,
which had grown by as much as 10% in2006, increased by no more than 3
1/C254%i n
2007. One factor in this context was the shiftin demand into 2006 owing to the VAT in-crease. Another factor was the loss of pur-chasing power in 2007 due not only to thetax increase but also to higher food pricesamong other things.
Nominal imports of capital goods fell by as
much as 5% in 2007. This was attributablemainly to the fact that imports of “Othertransport equipment”, which includes air andwater transport equipment and rail vehicles,were almost one-third lower than in 2006.This item is very volatile from year to year; if itis excluded, imports of capital goods were vir-tually unchanged.

20ing sharp fall in prices for goods of the cat-
egory “Office machinery and equipment”,amounting to 25% in 2007, pushed downimport values. It should also be borne in mindthat imports of motor vehicles, which areassigned to capital goods for statistical pur-poses, grew considerably more slowly than in2006 owing to the anticipatory effect gener-ated by the VAT increase. If transport equip-ment is excluded, imports of machinery andequipment are likely to have increased per-ceptibly in price-adjusted terms; this is alsoconsistent with the buoyant investment inGermany.
Furthermore, 2007 was marked by weak
energy imports, which declined by 8
1/C254%i n
value and 101/C254% in quantity on an annual
average. The main reason for this is likely tohave been the mild winter in 2007. As the an-nual average increase in the cost of importedenergy sources was relatively moderate ineuro terms (2
1/C254%), the overall decline in pur-
chasing power associated with energy prices,at31
1/C252billion, or 0.1% of nominal GDP , was
quite small compared with 0.7% and 0.5%of GDP in 2005 and 2006 respectively.
At 7
1/C254%, the increase in the value of imports
from the euro-area partner countries wasnotably sharper than that of imports fromnon-euro-area countries (4%). The growthdifferential was significantly smaller in realterms since the value of goods imported fromnon-euro-area countries went up less sharply(
1/C252%) than imported goods from other euro-
area countries (21/C252%) because of the appreci-
ation of the euro. Within the euro area, therewas an increase in imports from all of Germa-ny’s partner countries, albeit to a varying ex-
tent. Outside the euro area, there was a verylarge increase in imports from the EU mem-ber states in central and eastern Europe(15
1/C252%). Imports of goods from Slovakia and
the Czech Republic rose by 221/C252% and 20%
respectively. The increase for imports fromHungary was 15
1/C254% and from Poland
131/C252%. This shows once again that Germa-
ny’s economic links with these countries areproceeding apace.
In addition, the value of goods imported from
China once again showed vigorous growth(9
1/C252%), which means that China’s share of
total German imports has now increased to7%, overtaking the United States for the firsttime. A 7
1/C254% decline in imports from the
USA led to its share going down to 6%. Thisnegative development in imports from theUSA was probably due, above all, to lowersales figures in euro owing to appreciation.There are, however, no indications of a sig-nificant reduction in the quantity of imports.In contrast to imports from China, importsfrom the emerging markets in South-EastAsia also declined in value (-8%). As muchwas imported from Japan in nominal terms asin 2006. Owing to the weather-related weakdemand for energy in Germany, imports fromRussia and the OPEC countries, consistingmainly of mineral oil and natural gas, weredown 4
1/C254% and 71/C254% on 2006 respectively.
The fact that euro import prices for oil andgas combined went up by an average of nomore than
1/C252% in 2007 should also be taken
into consideration.Regional

21Invisible current transactions, which comprise
cross-border factor services, trade in servicesand current transfers, showed hardly anychange overall, although there were counter-balancing movements in the sub-accounts.There was a marked overall increase in thedeficits on services and current transfers, forexample, but this was almost offset by thelarger surplus in factor income, with a 34 bil-
lion increase in the surplus in cross-border in-vestment income. This was due, in particular,to higher net interest income from loans.Growth in interest income from cross-borderloans already granted was markedly higherthan the corresponding expenses for loanstaken up abroad. This was attributable, notleast, to the rising net external asset position.Furthermore, the debt service burden waseased by the appreciation of the euro, whichwas accompanied by a reduction in the pay-ments of interest on non-euro-denominatedforeign loans. Moreover, there was a markeddecline in interest rates in the USA in thesecond half of the year. In 2007, combineddividend and interest income from portfolioinvestment abroad increased at virtually thesame pace as the corresponding income ofnon-residents in Germany. By contrast, directinvestment income grew somewhat moreslowly than expenditure. In the case of in-come from employment, net expenditurehalved to 3
1/C252billion, which was due mainly
to the higher income of German cross-borderworkers.
Germany’s net current transfers to non-resi-
dents increased by 34 billion to 330
1/C252billion.
The deficit on public transfers increased by31
1/C252billion. This was caused mainly by signifi-cantly smaller payments received by Germany
in connection with EU agricultural policy, as aresult of which net payments to internationalorganisations increased by 33
1/C252billion. This
contrasted with extra tax receipts (+ 32 billion
net), especially from investment income taxon the assets of non-residents in Germany.The deficit on private transfers increased by32 billion, which was somewhat sharper than
the deficit on public transfers.
5The indemnifi-
cation payments from the “Remembrance,Responsibility and Future” foundation, whichare made by the private and public sectors,have now been largely disbursed.
The deficit on services increased by 3
1/C252billion
to3161/C252billion in 2007. The higher receipts
from transport, insurance and financial ser-vices were unable to offset entirely the deteri-oration in the other sub-accounts (especiallyin foreign travel). The biggest improvementon the balance, namely of 31
1/C252billion to 361/C252
billion, was achieved in cross-border trans-
port. The surplus on insurance-related ser-vices was increased by 31 billion, which was
essentially due to higher receipts. German re-insurers’ payments of claims to non-residentsshowed a sharp increase last year, but pre-mium income rose even more sharply. Net in-come from financial services (especially bankcommissions) likewise rose, namely by 31 bil-
lion.
The deficit on travel rose by 31
1/C252billion to
334 billion in 2007, but was still lower than in

residents on tourism in the euro-area partnercountries was virtually unchanged overall,more money was spent on long-haul jour-neys. Not least on account of the appreci-ation of the euro, travel destinations in Africa,Asia and America were more popular thanbefore.

Financial transactions
In the balance of payments, the current ac-
count surplus was associated with large netcapital exports by Germany. Financial trans-actions in 2007 were strongly affected by theturbulence in the international financialmarkets, however. Strong global economicgrowth, positive figures for the economy inGermany and Europe as a whole as well asevidently robust economic activity in the USAensured favourable sentiment in the stockmarkets, which was reflected in low rates ofvolatility and very benign equity markets.From the middle of last year onwards, how-ever, the escalating crisis in the US mortgagemarket – which hit banks and trading instructured credit products, in particular –prompted a fundamental reassessment ofrisks. The spreads on risky bonds widenedconsiderably, for example, and the interestrate spread between longer-dated US Treas-uries and euro-area government bonds re-versed in favour of the euro area. A particularfactor in this context was that the Fed beganto ease interest rates from mid-Septemberlast year, while the Governing Council of theECB, in view of the uncertainties in thesecond half of 2007, left lending rates onhold. Against this backdrop, the euro appreci-ated significantly against major currencies,especially the US dollar. The outlined inter-national effects had an impact on the activ-
ities of financial market players in Germanyand abroad. As the year went on, they actedwith increasing caution with regard to cross-border exposures and preferred secure andliquid forms of investment.
This was seen very clearly in portfolio invest-
ment, in which Germany recorded large netcapital imports in 2007. By contrast, therewere outflows in other segments of thefinancial account. This was especially true ofthe unsecuritised lending of banks, whichgreatly increased their net external assets, butalso applied to direct investment. Overall,

24there were net capital exports to the record
amount of 3221 billion. They were thus high-
er than the current account surplus, which –as a result – was reflected in a (positive) errorsand omissions item in the balance of pay-ments (see page 31).
There were net capital imports of 3134
1/C254bil-
lion through portfolio investment alone in2007. This was the highest ever figure andcontrasted with outflows totalling 310
1/C252bil-
lion in 2006. There were two key factorsbehind this sharp reversal. First, given robustdomestic economic activity and the financialmarket turbulence that set in later in the year,German investors purchased fewer foreigninstruments in 2007 than in the previous year(3133
1/C252billion compared with 31611/C252billion).
Second, in a period of heightened tensions,domestic securities again proved to be a“safe haven” for international investors.Additionally, new statistical definitions inportfolio investment played a part, since cer-tain warrants hitherto assigned entirely to thecategory of financial derivatives have beenrecorded as debt securities since February2007. This change means that, now, only thehedging of such instruments is assigned tofinancial derivatives (see the explanatorynotes on pages 26-27). As a result, markedlyhigher capital imports were recorded undermoney market paper and bonds.
In total, non-residents purchased 3268 billion
worth of German securities. Even after takingdue account of the statistical break, the inter-est shown by foreign investors in Germansecurities is extremely notable. This recordamount of investment was due very largely tothe buying of domestic debt securities (bonds
and money market paper), a total volume of3258 billion of which was placed with foreign
investors. It was mainly foreign demand forprivate issues that showed a sharp year-on-year rise ( 371
1/C252billion to 3144 billion). In
some cases, this involved cross-border trans-actions within affiliated enterprises and finan-cial institutions. In these cases, financialproducts launched in Germany (principallycertificates and warrants) were also sold en
bloc to affiliated enterprises domiciled
abroad. Such instruments were primarilytargeted at German private investors outsidethe financial sector. In the end, however,these investors acquired only a fairly smallpart of the original volume from the inter-posed intermediaries. The remaining amountis being held by the foreign institutions up tothe paper’s final maturity and – where reportsare available – will ultimately be recordedagain as a redemption and, hence, a counter-balancing transaction. The current sharpgrowth in business in innovative financialproducts should therefore be borne in mindwhen analysing the funds flowing to Ger-many as a result of the sale of debt securities.An increase in counterbalancing financialflows may be expected given further marketmaturity and increasing redemptions.
Alongside private issues, public bonds –
which were not affected by the develop-ments mentioned above – remained highlyfavoured by foreign investors ( 364 billion,
compared with 352
1/C252billion). Secure and
liquid German government bonds are pre-ferred by the market players especially inperiods when they have a heightend percep-Portfolio

25tion of risk. How much such instruments
were in demand last year was revealed notonly by the large amounts invested. Therewas a marked widening of the spreads ondebt instruments of other public and privateissuers. The interest advantage of the bench-mark Bund over other European governmentbonds hit a peak of 24 basis points in Novem-ber, having averaged no more than 8
1/C252basis
points in the first quarter of 2007. Thisincrease was probably due, not least, to thehigh liquidity of Federal bonds.
Money market paper was also in heavy de-
mand, however, especially in the second halfof the year when concerns about the sound-ness of some financial investments were con-tinually emerging and it was proving difficultfor some market players to assess their ownliquidity needs. Added to this was the above-mentioned statistical effect of the recordingof warrants, which have a maturity of lessthan one year in some cases and thereforecount as money market paper. All in all, for-eign investors purchased short-term Germanpaper for 350 billion.
In the German stock market, non-resident in-
vestors were again prominent as buyers in thecontext of their globally oriented portfolio de-cisions in 2007, albeit to a lesser extent thanin 2006 ( 36 billion, compared with 320
1/C252bil-
lion). Foreign funds flowed into Germany par-ticularly in the first half of the year, when thegeneral setting was being shaped by com-paratively low levels of uncertainty – meas-ured by the implicit volatilities of options onstock price indices – and optimistic estimatesof profits.

The German market for stru cture d se curities 1 has exper-
ien ced dynami c growth over the past few years. Thus, 
according to data provi ded by the German Derivatives 
Asso ciation ( Deutscher Derivate Verband ),2 the num ber 
of ex chan ge-tra ded pro ducts issue d in Germany rose in 
the course of last year alone from just un der 138,000 
to almost 300,000.3 The asso ciation estimate d the 
market volume of these se curities at the en d of 2007 
at €135 billion.4 German banks, in parti cular, but also, 
increasin gly, su bsidiaries of non-resi dent institutions 
whi ch do not have their own bankin g licence an d stat-
isti cally are assi gned to the se ctor German non- banks, 
act as issuers.
In 2007 German market parti cipants’ cross- border 
activities with these pro ducts, whi ch are re corded in the 
balan ce of payments, also in crease d signiﬁ cantly, due 
mainly to the rise in intra- group transa ctions by German 
spe cial purpose vehi cles with non-resi dent parent an d 
afﬁ liate d companies. This con cerns, ﬁ  rst an d foremost, 
tra de in stru cture d pro ducts, the vast majority of whi ch, 
as explaine d below, are classiﬁ  ed as debt se curities. 
However, the he dging transa ctions of German issuers 
with non-resi dent counterparties, whi ch prote ct a gainst 
the risks resultin g from the sale of these se cur ities,
also a ccounte d for a consi dera ble amount. As these 
are gener ally performe d with non-se curitise d ﬁ nan cial 
futures contra cts, they are re corded as derivatives in the 
balan ce of payments.Recording se curities transa ctions in the balan ce of 
payments is more compli cate d, as the conventional 
statisti cal classiﬁ  cations are often not a ble to provi de 
a suita ble representation of the great variety of stru c-
ture d pro ducts, espe cially in the li ght of the rapi d 
innovation. Since the performan ce of stru cture d se cur-
ities depen ds on the performan ce of an un derlyin g 
asset,5 these pro ducts, from an e conomi c perspe ctive, 
are derivatives. From a le gal perspe ctive, by contrast, 
they are generally debt se curities within the meanin g 
of se ction 793 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches
Gesetzbuch ) because they are bearer se curities that 
certify a payment promise.
The classiﬁ  cation in the balan ce of payments fo cuses 
on the le gal features of these se curities. Cross- border 
transa ctions in stru cture d pro ducts that fulﬁ  l the cri-
teria spe ciﬁ ed in se ction 793 of the German Civil Code 
are therefore classiﬁ  ed as debt se curities.6 Accordingly, 
stru cture d se cur ities that do not fulﬁ  l the criteria spe ci-
ﬁ ed in se ction 793 of the German Civil Code are classi-
ﬁ ed as ﬁ nan cial derivatives.
At the beginnin g of 2007, the stri ct appli cation of this 
classiﬁ  cation s cheme le d to a chan ge in the re cord-

the use of derivatives can therefore pro duce investment or spe culative

increase in non-resi dents’ pur chases of German private 
debt se curities from €71 billion in 200 6 to €195 ½ billion 
in 2007 is due to both the growth in pur chases of certiﬁ -

28now also very closely interlinked in terms of
ownership is shown, not least, by the factthat roughly half of the stocks of DAX enter-prises are in the hands of non-residents.
There were also fewer sales of domestic in-
vestment companies’ mutual fund shares toforeign investors. In the reporting year, only33
1/C252billion was raised, which was significantly
less than in 2006 ( 381/C252billion). This decline
may be due to business policy decisions by in-vestment companies domiciled in Germany,reflected in an increased sale of mutual fundproducts through locations abroad. This issuggested by the fact that domestic investorspurchased foreign mutual fund shares on alarge scale (as described below in more detail).
The reversal of sentiment in the financial mar-
kets during the year is shown very clearly bythe behaviour of German investors. Residentinvestors bought 3133
1/C252billion worth of
securities abroad. At 3122 billion, the lion’s
share was purchased in the first half of theyear, however. Moreover, the total amountinvested was down on the figure for 2006(3161
1/C252billion).
This reorientation particularly affected euro-
denominated foreign bonds. These are pre-dominantly bonds issued by public debtors inother euro-area countries, but some are asset-backed securities. In the wake of the finan-cial market turbulence, German investorsswitched, on the whole, from buying to sell-ing euro-denominated bonds in the middle oflast year. Residents had been purchasing suchlonger-dated interest-earning instruments upto the end of June 2007 ( 379 billion) but – forthe first time in 15 years – were selling them
in the six-month period up to the end of theyear ( 312
1/C252billion). As mentioned above, this
regrouping of investment was accompaniedby marked price discounts on foreign bondscompared with Federal bonds.
As in earlier years, German residents also
added quite a large amount of foreign cur-rency bonds to their portfolios ( 329
1/C252billion,
compared with 322 billion in 2006). In add-
ition to classical forms of investment, such asforeign government bonds, residents also ac-quired new products, such as securitisationsof traditional bank loans ( 313 billion). To-
wards the end of last year, however, domesticdemand for such paper issued abroad driedup almost entirely. Overall, it was mainlybonds denominated in US dollars that attract-ed the interest of German investors – despiteadverse factors, such as the weakness of theUS dollar and the reversal of the interest ratespread in favour of the euro.
German investors also invested fairly large
amounts in foreign money market paper lastyear ( 318
1/C252billion). One factor in the acquisi-
tion of these products was that, in unsettledtimes, short-term paper has a favourable risk-return profile. Besides such portfolio consider-ations, purchasing money market paper wasalso motivated by the efforts of some financialinstitutions to give prompt support to their se-curitisation special purpose vehicles domiciledabroad, which had come under pressure inthe wake of the financial market turbulence.

29markets, especially from the stock exchange
centres of Germany’s EU partner countries.German investors sold foreign equities for322
1/C252billion, having already sold 37 billion
worth of such instruments in 2006. It wasprobably not so much a case of a prevalentgeneral mistrust of foreign shares. Rather, thereturn prospects on the German stock marketwere especially promising. For example, at17
1/C252%, the broad CDAX showed an obvious-
ly sharper increase in value than many stockprice indices in other countries.
Indirect holding of shares through foreign
investment funds is becoming increasinglyimportant, however. At 341
1/C252billion, invest-
ment by German residents in non-residentfunds was well up on the figure for the previ-ous year ( 323
1/C252billion). Foreign money mar-
ket funds were also part of this development(316 billion). As in previous years, these re-
sources flowed mainly into foreign mutualfunds open to the general public; these are ofGerman origin but often manage their assetsfrom Luxembourg.
9
Cross-border transactions in financial deriva-tives, which form an item of their own withinfinancial investment, closed with large netcapital exports ( 371 billion) in the reporting
year. These were largely hedges in connectionwith the above-mentioned issues of struc-tured products. The balance was also expand-ed to a small extent by a reclassification ofcertain warrants. These developments are ex-plained in more detail on pages 26-27.
Robust global economic activity, the ample li-
quidity of many enterprises owing to theirstrong profitability and the initially ongoing
positive financing conditions led to a furtherrise in global direct investment flows last year.With an increase of one-sixth to more thanUS$1.5 trillion ( 31.1 trillion), growth – ac-
cording to initial UNCTAD estimates – was nolonger quite as strong as in 2006, however,and was driven mainly by the buoyant trendin mergers and acquisitions.
10
There was also a sharp increase in cross-bor-der M&A activities with German involvement.At 45%, the increase was, in fact, significant-ly larger than the figure worldwide (19
1/C252%).
This rise was ultimately reflected in Germanfirms’ higher direct investment abroad, whichalso comprises all the other cross-borderfinancial transactions among affiliated enter-prises. All in all, there were net capital exportsof385 billion in direct investment in 2007,
compared with 331
1/C252billion a year earlier.
German enterprises, in particular, expanded
their presence abroad considerably in 2007.They provided their foreign affiliates withmore funds ( 3122
1/C252billion) than ever before
9By contrast, the inflows of funds to domestic mutual
funds declined in 2007. They amounted to 3131/C252billion.
As much as 38 billion was withdrawn from domestic
funds open to the general public, in fact.
10According to data from Zephyr, Bureau van Dijk, the
volume of completed mergers and acquisitions increased
worldwide to around 31.7 trillion in terms of value,
which was spread over more than 20,000 transactions.
Cross-border transactions accounted for considerably
more than half of this. The credit crisis is likely to have
made it more difficult to borrow for leveraged projects
from the middle of the year onwards. Unlike in the case
of the announced mergers and acquisitions, this did not
lead to a sharp decline in the transactions that were actu-
ally conducted in 2007, however. The volume and num-
ber of worldwide M&As remained almost constant during
the year. This was probably due in part to the fact that
many of the acquisitions were financed with available
cash resources or conducted by an exchange of shares
and, therefore, without recourse to borrowing.... and mutual

30(2006: 3751/C252billion). This growth was due
mainly to the increase in credit transactionswith affiliated enterprises abroad. This in-volved outflows of funds amounting to 345
billion, compared with inflows of 35
1/C252billion
in 2006. Just under half of this was the repay-ment of loans which had been granted toGerman parent companies by their subsidiar-ies abroad. As was frequently the case in thepast, large German enterprises’ intra-grouptransactions with their financing institutionsin the Netherlands were a key factor in this.In addition, however, foreign subsidiarieswere also provided with a large amount offinancial resources in the form of loans.Equity investment ( 346
1/C252billion net) and re-
invested profits ( 330 billion) also contributed
to the aggregate result for German direct in-vestment. Their substantial level of the re-invested profits points to the continuingstrong profitability of the branches and sub-sidiaries domiciled abroad.
The main host countries for German direct
investment last year were the Netherlands(325
1/C252billion), the USA ( 316 billion), the
United Kingdom ( 314 billion) and Switzerland
(313 billion). The above-mentioned credit
transactions were reflected in the figures forthe Netherlands, while a fairly large transac-tion in the pharmaceuticals sector was a keyfactor in the case of Switzerland. At a total of3101
1/C252billion, the resources flowed predom-
inantly into industrial countries. Once again,foreign investment is therefore likely to haveprimarily served the purpose of opening upmarkets.
11Furthermore, investment location
decisions invariably also have other motives,including taxation and cost considerations.A sectoral analysis shows that holding com-
panies ( 335
1/C252billion), the insurance sector
(3141/C252billion) and manufacturers of transport
equipment ( 35 billion) expanded their cross-
border investment last year. Manufacturingprovided its foreign affiliates with a total of325
1/C252billion.12
Foreign enterprises invested 337 billion in
Germany last year, which was somewhat lessthan in 2006 ( 344 billion). At 334 billion,
most of the invested funds came from indus-trial countries. These inflows came mainlyfrom the EU partner countries, including theNetherlands ( 318 billion), France ( 314
1/C252bil-
lion) and the United Kingdom ( 381/C252billion).13
Foreign investors’ interest was focused on the
services sector. A major part of the financialresources flowed into holding companies(37
1/C252billion) and into credit institutions and
insurance companies ( 37 billion). Manufac-
turing received funds totalling 36 billion.12
Like direct investment, other investment,
which comprises financial and trade credits aswell as bank deposits and other assets, re-
11Besides developing markets by establishing produc-
tion plants in the host countries, the marketing subsidiar-
ies of German multinationals play a major role. This is in-
dicated by the fact that a large part of German exporters’
cross-border receivables resulting from exports were cre-
ated in the form of trade credits to affiliated enterprises
abroad.
12The sectoral breakdown of direct investment can be
analysed only to a limited extent on the basis of the avail-
able data. First, in the case of the holding companies,

31corded net capital exports in 2007. These
amounted to 3198 billion, compared with
outflows of 31051/C252billion one year earlier.
Counter to the overall trend, however, there
were net inflows of 38 billion in the non-
banks’ unsecuritised financial transactions.This was due mainly to the activities of gen-eral government ( 311
1/C252billion), which liquid-
ated foreign bank deposits and repatriatedthe funds. There were small outflows offunds ( 33
1/C252billion) in the case of enterprises
and households, which sharply increasedtheir foreign bank balances ( 341
1/C252billion)14
but simultaneously took up loans abroad on a
somewhat smaller scale ( 3351/C252billion).
Consequently, it was primarily the unsecuri-
tised financial transactions of the bankingsystem (including the Bundesbank), with netcapital exports of 3206 billion, that formed
the counterpart to the current account sur-plus. The domestic credit institutions consid-erably expanded their net lending to non-resident customers. All in all, German banks’net external assets grew by 3151
1/C252billion last
year. The external position of the Bundesbankincreased by 354
1/C252billion, doing so solely by
building up claims in the context of theTARGET large-value payment system.
15
There was a slight transaction-related in-crease in the Bundesbank’s reserve assets ofjust under 31 billion in 2007. This was due in
part to an increase of 31
1/C252billion in the for-
eign exchange reserves, which consistedmainly of reinvested interest income. Thereserve position in the IMF (including SDRs)declined somewhat ( 3
1/C252billion), however.Owing to their regular revaluation at market
prices, although this is of no relevance to thebalance of payments, the reserve assets in-creased by roughly 37 billion in value. In par-
ticular, the increase in the price of gold wasreflected in a 39 billion upward revaluation of
the gold holdings. By contrast, the currencyreserves fell 32
1/C252billion in value – mainly as a
result of the weakness in the US dollar. In bal-ance sheet terms, the reserve assets thereforeincreased by 38 billion in the reporting period
and amounted to 392
1/C252billion at the end of
the year.
All in all, the statistically recorded net capital
exports exceeded the current account surplusquite considerably in 2007. This means thatthere were corresponding errors and omis-sions in the balance of payments last year,too ( 336
1/C252billion). Much of this is probably
attributable to non-recorded cross-bordercash transactions. For example, expenditureon travel by German residents, where this istransacted in euro, and capital outflowsthrough the transfer of euro banknotes byGerman credit institutions or the Bundesbankare each captured only once, ie without amatching counterbooking.
16Such transac-
tions inevitably result in errors and omissions,as do reporting mistakes, gaps in recording,and problems regarding allocation to timeperiods.

33Macroeconomic effects
of changes in real
exchange ratesIn the past year, the euro appreciated
distinctly against key currencies. Thisaroused fears that the stronger euromight have a highly adverse effect onGerman business activity. However, theregional pattern of Germany’s foreigntrade, established invoicing practicesand enterprises’ hedging activitieshave so far done much to cushion theeffects of appreciation, especially onexports. Nonetheless, volume effectsmay be expected to occur over thelonger term, as exporters and import-ers will not be able to completely fac-tor lasting exchange rate shifts intotheir prices. However, there is empiricalevidence that the exchange rate elasti-city of German foreign trade, particu-larly exports, has declined over thepast few years.
With regard to demand, shifts in rela-
tive prices in the markets for exportsand imports can affect foreign trade,and thus economic growth, via theirimpact on competitiveness. Additionaleffects result from purchasing power-related income gains or losses (knownas “terms of trade effects”) which gen-erally tend to counteract the competi-tion effects.

34German unification. Real openness of the
German economy, measured here as the ratioof total nominal exports and imports ofgoods and services to gross domestic product(GDP), rose from 47
1/C252% in 1995 to 661/C252%i n
2000 to 861/C252% in 2007, a figure that is very
high also by international standards. This re-flects, for one thing, the fact that the volumeof internationally tradable goods has grownconsiderably and, for another, that the emer-ging market economies and the central andeast European countries in transition havegiven a new boost to world trade. As a corol-lary, changes in product prices on the worldmarkets and of exchange rates have gainedconsiderably in structural importance for theGerman economy.
Moreover, the international exchange rate
structure changed decisively upon the intro-duction of the euro on 1 January 1999. Therehave been no more exchange rate-relatedshifts in competitiveness between euro-areapartners since that time. The exchange rateof the single currency generally reflects therelative performance and stability of the euroarea as a whole; from the point of view of amember state, it can thus – depending on thecountry’s economic size – be regarded moreor less as exogenous.
The US dollar, at just under 24% (including
third-market effects), accounts for the largestweight in the euro’s trade-weighted externalvalue.
1From the beginning of monetary
union until the end of 2007, the euro-US dol-lar exchange rate, following a marked depre-ciation lasting until autumn 2000, rose by atotal of 25% in the subsequent phase of ap-preciation. The euro increased by 11
3/C254%
against the US dollar in the past year alone. Inaddition, the euro also appreciated againstthe pound sterling (9
1/C254%) and the Japanese
yen (5%); these currencies’ trade weights inthe euro’s external value are 20
3/C254%a n d
101/C252% respectively. By contrast, the euro
mostly fell against the currencies of the newEU member states, which have evolved intosignificant trading partners of the euro area.On a trade-weighted average, the euro’s ex-ternal value gained 8
3/C254% between the launch
of monetary union and the end of 2007.
Exchange rate effects and price setting
From the perspective of the German econ-
omy, an important feature is that a largepercentage of its exports of goods (around42
3/C254% in 2007) are destined for other euro-
area countries. This export segment is ex-change rate-dependent only to the extentthat competitors from non-euro-area coun-tries benefit from the euro’s appreciationagainst the US dollar and other non-euro-area currencies. Given this regional focus,movements of the euro’s nominal effectiveexchange rate therefore have only a mutedeffect on Germany’s foreign trade. Regardingthe US dollar, it should be noted that theshare of Germany’s exports destined for theUnited States, at 7
1/C252% in 2007, is not very
large. However, the exchange rate effect isGrowing

ging market economies which, in the pastfew years, have evolved into major exportmarkets (accounting for 3
1/C252% of German ex-
ports at the last count), oriented their curren-cies very closely to the US dollar, at least inthe past.
2Measured by a group of 19 major
trading partners of Germany,3the US dollar,
including third-market effects, has a weightof around 15% from the point of view of theGerman economy.
The impacts of exchange rate movements on
real exports depend in great measure on thetime horizon under observation. Over theshort term, the choice of invoicing currencyand the degree of cross-currency hedgingplay an important role. Where it has beenagreed that the delivery contracts for Germanexports will be invoiced in euro, it is the for-
eign buyer who bears the exchange rate riskof an appreciating euro. By contrast, export-ers whose sales are invoiced in US dollars– unless they have hedged their anticipatedforeign currency-denominated revenue flows –must expect that a bilateral appreciation ofthe euro will cause their export revenues tofall when they settle transactions concludedpreviously. According to surveys conductedby the Ifo Institute on behalf of the Bundes-bank, 80% of Germany’s exports are current-ly invoiced in euro and only 13% in US dol-1999 Q1 = 100, quarterly, log scale

37lars.4Two-thirds of German exports to non-
euro-area countries are invoiced in euro andone-fifth in US dollars.
German companies invoicing in foreign cur-
rencies, moreover, are making widespreaduse of the possibility of hedging their exportrevenues against exchange rate risk. Accord-ing to the Ifo survey results, three-quarters ofall foreign currency receivables from exportbusiness were hedged against exchange rate-related losses. Enterprises can use hedgingproducts that have standardised maturitiesand currency amounts and are traded onofficial exchanges. Alternatively, especially forlarge projects, customised hedges with ma-turities lasting over several years are available.In practice, foreign currency receivables areoften only partly hedged, either for cost rea-sons or speculative purposes.
Given the major weight of the euro as an in-
voicing currency for German export businessand the large share of hedged foreign cur-rency receivables, a depreciation of the USdollar against the euro therefore squeezesGerman enterprises’ export revenues only toa relatively small extent in the short term.Over the longer term, when the issue is notonly fulfilling existing delivery contracts butalso concluding new ones, the significance ofthe invoicing currency is tempered somewhatbecause the prices are generally recalculatedor renegotiated based on the new exchangerates. In addition, special hedges for newexport deals are only possible based on theexchange rate that is then current. If expect-ed export revenue flows are systematicallyhedged, the costs of hedging the underlyingtransaction are likely to increase distinctly as
the time horizon lengthens.
However, the current appreciation of the euro
generally affects not only firms’ export salesbut also their costs by reducing the price ofthe imported intermediate inputs that go intothe manufacture of exported goods. Theseimported inputs latterly made up 45% of ex-ports, as against 31% in 1995.
5It should be
noted in this context that the euro’s exchangerate against the US dollar is more relevant forimports than for exports. Thus the share ofGermany’s imports from the USA and thecountries which oriented their currencies veryclosely to the US dollar in total German im-ports, at 13
1/C252%, is larger than their share in
German exports (11%). In addition, the pricesof most commodities (including crude oil) inthe world markets are quoted in US dollars.The appreciation-related cost relief, whichhas been particularly noticeable in Germany’senergy bills, was a key factor in ensuring that,all in all, German exporters have coped rela-tively well with the strengthening euro in thepast few years.
Whether or not firms will tolerate reduced ex-
port revenues owing to currency appreciationdepends, among other things, on whetherthey see the shifts in exchange rates as beingtemporary or permanent. If they regard theeuro’s appreciation as merely transient, ex-

38porters can hold prices in their sales markets
constant as long as their variable unit costsare covered. Or they may opt to temporarily“cross-subsidise” their exports to those coun-tries from their profits in domestic business orrevenue from intra-euro-area trade. Majorshifts in exchange rates that are regarded aspermanent, by contrast, cause exporters torethink their strategic behaviour. Owing tothe relatively volatile nature of exchange ratemovements, however, it is hard for marketparticipants to decide early on whether thechange is temporary or permanent. This con-tinues to hold even though the volatility ofboth the euro’s nominal effective exchangerate and the euro-US dollar exchange ratehas, on the whole, shown a visible downwardtendency over the past few years.
To some degree, exporters can offset ex-
change rate-related losses in price competi-tiveness by adjusting their intermediate in-puts. Firms can, for instance, transfer theirbusiness at fairly short notice to suppliersfrom countries whose currencies have depre-ciated against the euro or otherwise providecost advantages. Medium to long-term strat-egies are aimed more at restructuring produc-tion and revising the firm’s internal policiesfor choosing production sites. In this way theshare of imported intermediate inputs fromlow-cost countries can be increased at the ex-pense of domestically generated value added– made more expensive by currency appreci-ation – or else manufacturing can be shiftedpartly to other, lower-cost countries in orderto be able to sell the final products at com-petitive euro prices without any (major) lossesin revenues. An important element of thisstrategy is “natural hedging”, which has
been practised, for instance, by the Germanautomotive industry and its suppliers particu-larly in the past 15 years by establishingmanufacturing capacity in the United States.This means not only that products are de-livered to the local buyers without any ex-change rate risk but that, if the euro appreci-ates, exchange rate-related losses from Ger-man exports to the USA are offset withinthe firm through exports to Europe. Such ahedge can also be achieved by buying equitystakes or existing manufacturing sites.
For the aforementioned reasons, exchange
rate movements have a noticeable impact onprices in the respective foreign sales marketsonly after a time-lag. To a lesser extent, thisalso holds for imports. Instead of passing theappreciation through to local prices directlyand completely, foreign trade enterprises pur-sue a pricing-to-market policy at times. Thetougher the competition in the respectivesales market, the less the firm’s own revenuesand costs play a key role in short-term price-setting and the more its competitors’ pricesplay a role. Such behaviour is more or lesspronounced across the various product typesdepending on the market and competitivesituation.
6Empirical studies have shown that,
in the case of food, motor vehicles and com-puters, ie products that are traded on highlycompetitive markets, up to between one-quarter and one-third of the shifts in ex-change rate parities are factored into exportprices (in domestic currency) over the long

39term.7On the whole, export prices calculated
in euro, as a weighted average of the sectorsstudied, are adjusted to include only aroundone-eighth of each respective change in ex-change rates.
When importers set their prices in euro, ex-
change rates are important insofar as theirown costs depend on the exchange rate atwhich they can obtain their imported goods.The less price-elastic domestic demand forthe imported product is, the more stronglydomestic importers react to exchange ratefluctuations. Econometric analyses for Ger-many show that between one-tenth andfour-fifths of exchange rate movements, de-pending on the product category, are reflect-ed in import prices over the long term.
8Im-
port prices for computers, paper products,metals, machinery, electrical equipment andpetroleum products show an exchange ratepass-through of one-third or more. In thecase of product categories with a large shareof commodities, the exchange rate pass-through is particularly high as commoditiesare priced in US dollars in the global marketsand the demand for these goods is largelyprice-inelastic in the short and medium term.Accordingly, a virtually complete pass-throughcan be demonstrated for imported petroleumproducts.
On the whole, it transpires that German im-
porters adjust their euro-denominated pricesfar more strongly to exchange rate move-ments than do exporters. This is partly be-cause commodities and semi-finished goodsare more important for imports than for ex-ports. Had the euro not appreciated againstthe US dollar, the costs of purchasing crude
oil and petroleum products as well as othercommodities would, at any rate, have riseneven more strongly than was actually thecase.1991 = 100, log scale

7See K Stahn (2007), Has the export pricing behaviour
of German enterprises changed? Empirical evidence from
German sectoral export prices, Journal of Economics and
Statistics, Vol 227/3, p 295 ff. This study analyses the ex-
change rate’s impact by means of the exchange rate
component of the indicator of the price competitiveness
of the German economy against 19 major trading part-
ners, with the exception of export prices for computers.
Therefore, the small exchange rate effect observed for
some product categories might be attributable to the
fact that the group of 19 industrial countries no longer
completely reflects the regional composition of foreign
competitors. In addition, the estimation approach does
not capture the influence of exchange rates on domestic
manufacturing costs.
8The estimations of import prices produce relatively ro-
bust results for the exchange rate pass-through. Since
the domestic competitors’ prices themselves are depend-
ent on import prices, however, the pricing-to-market ef-
fect could not be analysed for each product category.Import prices

40Significance of demand and income
effects
Where exchange rate movements change the
relationship between domestic and foreignprices (converted to domestic currency), theytrigger, via substitution processes, shifts in thestructure of domestic expenditure and in for-eign trade which, in turn, influence domesticeconomic growth (competition effect). If thedomestic economy’s competitiveness deteri-orates through, for instance, a rise in domes-tic prices relative to foreign prices, domesticexporters tend to lose market share in theirforeign sales markets while the position offoreign sellers in the domestic market im-proves. The size of this competition effect de-pends on how strongly domestic export andimport volumes react to shifts between do-mestic and foreign prices. Empirical studiesshow that, in terms of amount, the elasticityof German exports to changes in this priceratio averages 0.25 over the long term.
9This
means that, if domestic prices rise by 1% rela-tive to foreign prices, real exports go down by0.25%. This relatively small influence is duepartly to the fact that the share of relativelyprice-inelastic goods in the range of Germanexports is quite high. Exports to non-euro-area countries, in particular, respond relativelyweakly to price competitiveness.
Econometric studies also find evidence that
the responsiveness of German exports, espe-cially to non-euro-area countries, to relativeprices has decreased since German unifica-tion in comparison with the 1980s.
10This
could be due to the fact that domestic ex-porters’ pricing-to-market behaviour hasgrown in importance since the 1990s, there-
by reducing appreciation-related losses in theGerman economy’s measured price competi-tiveness (for more on the econometric analy-ses see the annex on page 43 ff). However, itshould be pointed out that the underlying in-dicator used here does not contain the cur-rencies of all non-euro-area countries. Thusthe Asian emerging markets, which to datehave oriented their currencies closely to theUS dollar, are not recorded, which means thatthe US dollar may be underweighted.
11
For German imports of goods, the elasticityto the relevant price ratio can be quantifiedat 0.21. This likewise relatively small effect isattributable to the fact that the largely price-inelastic categories of commodities and semi-finished goods make up a significant share ofGerman imports. To the extent that rising im-port prices are related to the increase in theprices of energy and commodities, domestic
9For exports, the price ratio is adequately represented by
the indicator of the German economy’s price competitive-
ness against 19 major trading partners based on the de-
flators of total sales. Price competitiveness thus shows
the price ratio between a domestic basket of goods and
a foreign basket of goods. These can be compared by
converting the foreign currency-denominated foreign
prices into domestic currency units using the appropriate
exchange rates. For the concept, see Deutsche Bundes-
bank, New and recalculated indicators of the German
economy’s price competitiveness, Monthly Report, May
2007, pp 31-35. For imports, the ratio of the import de-
flator to the GDP deflator is used. The elasticities of the
foreign trade-relevant price ratios were derived from esti-
mations of exports and imports of goods and services as
defined in the national accounts over the period 1992-
2006.

41buyers can substitute foreign goods by do-
mestic products only to a limited degree.
Competition effects are supplemented by
changes in the purchasing power of incomeswhich accrue to domestic sectors throughchanges in the ratio of a country’s export andimport prices, also known as the terms oftrade. The (commodity) terms of trade statethe number of units of an imported goodthat can be exchanged for a unit of an exportcommodity. It can thus also be interpreted asa measure of welfare which shows the inten-sity of the benefits of the free internationaltrade of goods. For a given volume of ex-ports, changes in the terms of trade lead topurchasing power effects in that movementsin export and import prices either enlarge ornarrow domestic sectors’ real income.

The real income or the real value of GDP arepurchasing power-based volumes that showthe quantity of consumer and capital goodsthat corresponds to a certain level of valueadded. By contrast, price-adjusted GDP cap-tures real value added (at previous-yearprices). Consequently, the terms of tradeeffect represents the foreign trade-inducedgain or loss in purchasing power to thedomestic economy resulting from shifts in theratio of export prices to import prices; it iscalculated as the difference in the rates ofchange between the real value of GDP andprice-adjusted GDP . A positive (negative)terms of trade effect measures the addedgain (or loss) of purchasing power to domes-tic sectors – measured as units of price-adjusted GDP – along with the value equiva-lent of the volume of output.In order to reflect changes in purchasing
power in the real value of GDP , exports andimports – unlike real GDP – are price-adjustedusing a uniform price index instead of thespecial export or import deflator. To this end,the Federal Statistical Office uses the priceindex of final domestic demand, which re-€b n

42flects the structure of the purchases of goods
and services for which the national income isused, thereby revealing the entire gain or lossin purchasing power. The use of this measure-ment concept leads to purchasing powereffects if export and import prices move dif-ferently than the price index of domesticdemand. In Germany, this is particularly evi-dent in the case of sharp fluctuations in theprices of commodities, since this category ofgoods is much more important for imports
than for domestically produced goods.
It may be expected, moreover, that changes
in purchasing power-related income inducedby the terms of trade may also impact on thesectoral income distribution and – given spe-cific spending propensities – on real domesticdemand. The distribution of income betweenprivate consumption and corporate invest-ment may be changing. The better, for in-stance, companies are able to pass throughincreased costs caused by terms of trade todomestic buyers – ie the more they are ableto maintain their profit margins – the strongerthe impact of purchasing power losses causedby a deterioration of the terms of trade willbe on the real disposable incomes of domes-tic households.
An appreciation or a depreciation of the do-
mestic currency can also lead to valuation-induced wealth effects. Decisive factors in-clude the country’s net position and the cur-rency structure of foreign assets and liabilities.According to provisional calculations, Germa-ny’s net foreign assets fell in the first threequarters of the past year (more recent dataare not available) owing to currency appreci-ation effects by 347 billion vis-/C224-vis the end of
2006. Enterprises and individuals saw theirwealth decline by 338
1/C252billion. This repre-
sented around 2% of total disposable incomeof all domestic sectors.
Purchasing power-related real income effects
are caused particularly by changes in theprices of commodities, especially crude oiland natural gas. This is largely because import€b n

43prices react relatively strongly to changes in
international commodity prices.13The energy
price-induced purchasing power effect can becalculated by valuing the previous period’snominal net energy imports with the changein the prices of energy imports. Since themid-1990s the purchasing power loss associ-ated with rising energy prices has averagedaround
1/C254% of GDP or disposable income of
all domestic sectors per year. The strongestpurchasing power losses were felt in theyears 2000 and 2005-06, when energy im-port prices rose by 79
1/C254%, 381/C254% and
211/C252% respectively. By contrast, the euro’s
rise against the US dollar in 2007 contributedto an improvement in the terms of trade byapproximately
3/C254% even though the world
market prices for commodities once againjumped sharply.
When assessing the effects of terms of trade
and of competition on the real value of GDP ,it must be taken into account that the com-ponent effects often run in opposite direc-tions. In the 1993-2007 observation period,
the overall effects were located in the rangeof -1 to +
1/C252percentage point. Given an an-
nual average increase in the real value of GDPof 1
1/C254%, the competition and terms of trade
effects exerted quite a strong macroeconomicimpact in some years. In 2007, growth of thereal value of GDP declined by
1/C252percentage
point on balance because the competition ef-fect was much stronger than the terms oftrade effect. On average of this period, thetotal impact on real income of the pricechanges relevant to foreign trade, however,was virtually neutral. This is also consistentwith the finding that the German economy’sexport activity fundamentally depends muchmore on the growth of export markets andthe attractiveness of exporters’ product pro-file than merely on exchange rate changes.
Annex
Pricing behaviour in German foreign trade
Price formation in foreign trade is shaped by cost
factors and competitive relationships. The follow-ing empirical study examines the extent to whichexport and import prices depend on domestic pro-duction costs, the prices of imported intermediategoods and commodities and the respective pricesof competitors, and how the importance of theindividual factors has changed over time. The esti-mation equation is:p

oil prices to import prices for petroleum products is nearly
complete. One-third of the changes in the world market
prices for iron and steel are passed through to import
prices of metal products. For other product categories,
the pass-through rate of selected commodity prices is up
to one-seventh.
14The price of commodities as denominated in US dol-
lars is used only for the import prices of petroleum prod-
ucts and metals. Depending on the product category,
global market prices for food, beverages and tobacco,
spun yarn, cellulose, crude oil, iron and steel and non-
ferrous metals are included.Overall effects

44export prices, the elasticities /C12i1and /C12i2represent
the cost pass-through, with ph
irepresenting the
firm’s own production costs.15/C12i3and /C12i4are the
pricing-to-market effect via the foreign prices pf
which, for the sake of comparability, are translated
into the domestic currency using exchange ratew.
16In the case of import prices, /C12i1reflects the
pricing-to-market effect via domestic competitors’prices. The other elasticities show the cost or (inthe case of /C12
i4) exchange rate pass-through.17
The estimations are performed in levels as cointe-
gration relationships were found between thevariables.
18Furthermore – following Saikkonen’s
(1991) proposed method of solving the endogene-ity problem – the first differences of the regressorsare taken into account with up to one lag or leadperiod.
19The estimations are adjusted for autocor-
relation and heteroscedasticity using the Newey-West covariance estimator.
To ascertain whether the importance of individual
factors has changed since German unification inthe 1990s, an additional dummy variable is intro-duced for each determinant which splits the obser-vation period into a pre-unification and a post-unification phase.
20Their estimated elasticities
show how the influence of the respective regressorhas changed since German unification comparedwith the preceding period. This approach has theadvantage of being able to test the changes in pri-cing behaviour for statistical significance. More-over, shifts in cost pass-through and pricing-to-market are tested simultaneously.
To identify the overall effect on exporters’ and im-
porters’ price-setting, the share of products in thetotal volume of exports and imports showing anincrease in pricing-to-market is compared with theshare of products showing a decrease. The cost orexchange rate pass-through is measured analo-
gously. Export prices show a weakening of costpass-through and a strengthening of pricing-to-market. Import prices, too, indicate strongerpricing-to-market. However, the statistical signifi-cance does not give a clear indication as towhether pass-through via the commodities’ pricesor the exchange rate movements has weakenedaltogether.
21
The results indicate that the price pick-up of Ger-man export goods compared with competitors’
15Since changes in the prices of commodities affect
both foreign producers and domestic exporters, /C12i2could
also reflect pricing-to-market effects. The small elasticities
– apart from the estimations for petroleum products – in-
dicate, however, that this determinant should be attrib-
uted to the cost pass-through.
16For each export product category, production costs
are approximated on the basis of sectoral domestic pro-
ducer prices, foreign competitors’ prices on the basis of
the trade-weighted aggregated deflators of total sales of
19 industrial countries and exchange rates on the basis of
the weighted bilateral exchange rate of these countries
against the euro. The sectoral prices of US producers and
the euro/US dollar exchange rate are applied to com-
puters.
17Depending on the import product category, domestic
competitors’ prices are measured using domestic unit la-
bour costs or the domestic GDP deflator. This effect can-
not be estimated robustly for all product categories, how-
ever. The trade-weighted foreign unit labour costs or de-
flators of total sales of 19 industrial countries provide an
approximation of the production costs of importers and
are translated into domestic currency using the weighted
bilateral exchange rate against the euro or the euro/US
dollar exchange rate. In the case of computers, the same
foreign variables that are used for exports are applied.
18The regressions are based on logarithmic, quarterly
data containing seasonal effects. Corresponding dummy
variables are therefore factored in.
19See P Saikkonen (1991), Asymptotically efficient esti-
mation in cointegrated regressions, Econometric Theory,
vol. 7, pp 1-21.
20Export prices are analysed for the sub-periods 1976-
1989 and 1991-2004. 1990 was heavily distorted by Ger-
man unification and was therefore factored out of the es-
timation. The import price estimations cover the period
1976-2006. Depending on the product category, the
dummy variable is set at 1990 or 1991 (in one case,
1986).
21This finding is in line with other econometric studies
which likewise find no clear-cut empirical evidence for
changes in pricing strategy, although there are indications
of a weakening of exchange rate pass-through to import
and consumer prices.

46products in foreign markets resulting from an
appreciation of the domestic currency has beensmaller since German unification than it was in the1980s. This implies that exchange rate movementsare being absorbed more through changes in theprofit margin, thus at least temporarily loweringthe return on capital. Enterprises are evidently nowkeener to avoid losses in sales volume followingcurrency appreciation than they were in the 1980s.On the other hand, there is no clear evidence that,overall, import prices have become less responsiveto exchange rate changes since the 1990s despitethe fact that the share of – fairly price-inelastic –commodities and semi-finished goods in Germanimports has almost halved on average. Assumingcomparable exchange rate movements before andafter German unification, the cost advantage forGerman enterprises stemming from currency ap-preciation has therefore probably remained atlargely the same level.
The weakening of cost pass-through or strength-
ening of pricing-to-market with regard to exportprices may not, however, be solely attributable to
changes in firms’ behaviour in connection withtougher international competition in the wake ofongoing globalisation, the establishment of theeuro area or EU enlargement. A wide range of fac-tors may have played a role which imply a similarweakening of exchange rate pass-through in thecase of import prices, too. For instance, supply-side factors such as advances in productivity andthe deregulation of product and labour marketsmay have played a part. The clearer prioritising ofprice stability by central banks worldwide, whichpushed down inflation expectations, may likewisehave been conducive to reducing cost or exchangerate pass-through. It is also possible that the prod-uct profile of the goods traded on import and ex-port markets has shifted from products with highcost pass-through to goods with low pass-through.Improvements in the quality of imported products,for instance, would have had a similar effect sincedemand for higher-quality goods is usually moreprice-elastic.
