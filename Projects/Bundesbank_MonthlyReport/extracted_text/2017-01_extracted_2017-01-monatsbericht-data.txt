Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Germany’s economic growth is likely to have 
gathered pace significantly in the final quarter 
of 2016. Both domestic and external factors 
played a part, with German enterprises’ goods 
exports recently recording a steep rise. In tan -
dem with very strong industrial orders, this led 
to a clear increase in industrial production. The 
construction sector, too, shrugged off its third-  
quarter lethargy and saw a resurgence of 
growth. Here, sentiment indicators are break -
ing one record after the next, and also in other sectors, enterprises rate their business situation 
as very favourable. To round out the list, private 
consumption appears to have continued to 
provide positive stimuli.
According to provisional calculations by the 
Federal Statistical Office, real gross domestic 
product (GDP) expanded by 1.9% (1.8% after 
calendar adjustment) in 2016. This means that 
the increase in aggregate output was some -
what stronger than in 2015 (+1.7%). GDP 
growth was sustained mainly by healthy do -
mestic demand. Private consumption benefited 
from the favourable situation in the labour market and the strong growth in real dispos -
able incomes spurred by depressed inflation. 
Construction investment received additional 
support from favourable financing conditions 
and there was strong growth in refugee-  r elated 
government consumption at the beginning of 
the year in particular. By contrast, export 
growth was dampened by weak global trade. 
German enterprises’ exports to non-  eur o-  ar ea 
countries, in particular, were muted.
Industry
In November 2016, industrial production in 
Germany increased slightly by ¼% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms. On an 
average of October and November, it was up 
significantly from the third quarter (+¾%). Sub -
stantial output growth was recorded mainly by 
German manufacturers of machinery and 
equipment, while motor vehicle manufacturers 
suffered clear losses. The output of capital goods showed a steep 1% expansion overall, 
however. Producers of intermediate goods in -
creased their output to a similar extent. By con -
trast, there was only a slight uptick in the pro -
duction of consumer goods (+¼%).
Following the exceptionally strong growth in 
October, new industrial orders in November re-
corded a steep seasonally adjusted decline of 
2½% on the month. However, on an average 
of October and November, the volume of new orders was still showing a strong upward trend 
(+3¾%) compared with the third quarter. Dis -
regarding large-  scale or ders, growth was even 
more dynamic at 5%. Against this backdrop, 
the outlook for German industry is favourable. 
The buoyant inflow of orders was mainly attrib-
utable to domestic orders (+4¼%) and orders 
from countries outside the euro area (+5¾%). 
By contrast, there were fewer orders from 
euro-  ar ea countries (-½%). However, this was 
mainly due to the extremely weak placement 
of orders for other transport equipment, where 
the proportion of large contracts is very high. If 
this area is excluded, euro-  ar ea countries also 
placed significantly more orders compared with the average for the third quarter.
After seasonal adjustment, industrial sales in November increased clearly by 1% on the 
month. On an average of October and Novem -
ber, they were up by a steep 1½% from the third quarter. Producers of intermediate and capital goods recorded a similarly strong in -
crease in sales (+1½%). Sales of consumer goods also showed a distinct ¾% rise in 
growth, however. With regard to the regional 
development of sales, German industrial enter -German econ-

prises profited in particular from the brisk de -
mand in non-  eur o-  ar ea countries. In line with 
this, nominal exports of goods in November 
showed a steep rise on the month (+3¾%). 
Average exports for the October-  November  
period were also up significantly from their 
third-  quarter level (+3 %). In spite of rising ex -
port prices, a substantial increase of 2¼% was 
also posted in real terms. In November, nom -
inal goods imports were likewise up consider -
ably on the month (+3½%). The average of 
October   and November , at 3%, also repre -
sented a steep increase from their third-  quarter 
level. Owing to the quite dynamic development 
of import prices, however, the growth of goods 
imports was only nearly half as high in real 
terms (+1½%).
Construction
Construction output continued its ascent in 
November 2016, posting a steep month-  o n- 
month increase of 1½% in seasonally adjusted 
terms. The average of October and November 
showed a significant increase of just over 1½% 
from the third quarter. This was due chiefly to 
the substantial expansion in the main construc -
tion sector (+3½%), in particular in building 
construction. The finishing trades posted a 
slight decline (-½%), however. The outlook for 
the construction sector overall remains very 
favourable  . Both new orders and building per -
mits in October – the most recent period for 
which statistics are available – are up consider -
ably on their third-  quarter level. F urthermore, 
according to the Ifo Institute, the business ex -
pectations of German construction firms are 
approaching the record level attained shortly 
after reunification.
Labour market
Following a few weaker months, employment 
recorded a somewhat stronger rise again in 
November 2016. The seasonally adjusted num -
ber of persons in work in Germany increased Construction

by 34,000 on the month, compared with 
+15,000 in October. However, growth was 
lower than one year earlier; the year-  on-  year  
increase declined further to 297,000 persons or 
+0.7%. According to the provisional disaggre -
gated estimate provided by the Federal Em -
ployment Agency up until October, the primary reason why employment growth was relatively 
subdued in the third quarter and stretching 
into October is that the number of jobs subject 
to social security contributions went up only 
moderately; in addition, there continued to be 
a slightly negative trend in exclusively low-  paid 
part- time employment. However , the leading 
labour market indicators, in particular the Ifo employment barometer and the Federal Em -
ployment Agency’s BA-  X job index, are still ex -
ceptionally favourable, implying that the recent stronger job growth might continue.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in Decem -
ber fell significantly on the month. 2.64 million 
persons were registered as unemployed with 
the Federal Employment Agency, 17,000 fewer than in November. The unemployment rate re-
mained at 6.0%. Compared with the same 
month one year earlier, 113,000 fewer persons were out of work, and the unemployment rate 
was 0.3 percentage point lower. Total under -
employment (excluding short-  time work),  
which also includes persons taking part in la -
bour market policy measures, rose only margin -
ally in December. This was preceded by a clear rise in underemployment using the Federal Em -
ployment Agency’s definition in connection 
with measures to integrate refugees into the 
German labour market. According to the IAB 
labour market barometer, official unemploy -
ment could continue to fall slightly over the 
next few months.
Prices
After OPEC and other countries had agreed to 
cut oil production, crude oil prices rose consid -
erably at the beginning of December 2016 and reached a level of just over US$55 per barrel of Brent crude on a monthly average. This repre -
sents a month-  on -  mo nth increase of more 
than 15%. Owing to the distinct decline in 
prices in December 2015, the annual percent -
age growth even shot up from 4% to more than 40%. As this report went to press, the 
price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at 
US$55. The premium on crude oil futures was 
US$2 for deliveries six months ahead and only 
slightly higher for deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import and producer prices continued their as -
cent at the end of the year. Although energy 
prices were up only marginally up until Novem -
ber,1 the prices of other goods rose sharply, 
notably at the import level. Overall, prices were 
up on the year. Import prices were up by +0.3% on the year in November and industrial produ -
cer prices by 1.0% in December (November 
+0.1%).
Consumer prices recorded a steep rise of 0.5% 
in December in seasonally adjusted terms ac -
cording to the national consumer price index 
(CPI). Prices for mineral oil products went up 
very significantly on the back of rising crude oil 
prices. Prices of services showed a clear in -
crease on the month owing to a notable hike in 
prices for package holidays. Rents, by contrast, 
increased only moderately, and prices for food 
and other goods remained virtually unchanged. 
Overall, year-  on-  year inflation incr eased from 
+0.8% as measured by the national CPI and from +0.7% as defined by the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) to +1.7% in 
each case. This was also due to the marked de -
cline in prices in December 2015. Inflation was 
still muted (CPI +0.5% and HICP +0.4%) on 
average for 2016. Given the recent clear rise in 
daily average prices for mineral oil products, in-
flation could climb to just over +2% in January.Further fall in

1 At the import level, data are currently only available for 
November, a month in which crude oil prices had not yet 
increased. Data are already available for December at the 
industrial producer level, but the recent price surge only 
had a limited impact on account of the low weighting of 
oil.Deutsche Bundesbank

Public finances2
Local government finances
Local government core budgets and off-  budget 
entities ran a small cash surplus in the third 
quarter of 2016, having posted a surplus of just 
over €1 billion a year earlier. Revenue con -
tinued to rise considerably (by 5½%, or just 
over €3 billion). Tax receipts increased by 3% 
(€½ billion), driven primarily by growth of just 
over 5% in revenue from local business tax (after deducting the shares accruing to other government levels). However, as in the previ -
ous quarter, the rise in transfers from state gov-ernment – not least in connection with support 
for refugees – was still far stronger and more 
influential (9½%, or €2 billion). Also note -
worthy was the rise of 9% (€½ billion) in re -
ceipts from fees, which was largely due to a 
special effect in North Rhine-  Westphalia.3
At just over 7½%, or €4½ billion, growth in expenditure was much stronger than that in revenue. Once again, the large increase in 
spending on social benefits made a particularly strong impact (11%, or €1½ billion). Given the 
substantial drop in refugee migration in 2016 
and progress made in processing asylum appli -
cations,4 outlays on benefits for asylum seekers 
fell somewhat on the quarter but were still up 
by a sizeable 75% (€½ billion) on the year. Spending on assistance for young people housed in welfare facilities, which notably in -
cludes benefits for unaccompanied refugee 
minors, grew by one-  quarter (just under €½ 
billion). In addition, outlays on social assistance 
rose considerably (by 5½%, or just under €½ 
billion), whilst expenditure on accommodation 
for recipients of unemployment benefit  II re-
mained more or less stagnant. Other operating 
expenditure increased by 6½% (almost €1 bil -
lion). The impetus from refugee migration ap -
peared to abate here too. At just below 6½% 
(€1 billion), year-  on- year growth in personnel  
expenses was much stronger than in the previ -
ous quarters. The effects of the agreed 2½% 
increase in negotiated rates of pay were prob-ably markedly augmented by back payments 
for the preceding months. At 5½% (just under 
€½ billion), the rise in fixed asset formation 
had slowed down but remained significant.
In the first three quarters combined, local gov -
ernment’s budget balance thus deteriorated by 
€3 billion compared with the same period a 
year earlier. However, this downward trend 
may have come to an end in the final quarter 
for two reasons: first, the budgetary burdens 
associated with refugee migration were already relatively large a year earlier and, second, cen-
tral and state government’s cost assumption 
measures were probably making a greater im -
pact by then. However, tax refunds due to pre -
vious court rulings were expected to curtail tax revenue in the final quarter. Nonetheless, local 
government may still have achieved a broadly 
balanced budget for 2016 as a whole.
As things stand, budgetary burdens resulting 
from refugee migration are likely to decline in 
2017. Irrespective of this, financial assistance 
from central government will be increased by a 
further €1½ billion. From 2018 onwards, the funds granted since 2015 will be replaced by 
the permanent financial relief package for local 
government (€5 billion), which has now been 
adopted and will result in an additional €2½ 
billion net for local government compared with 2017. Consequently, a marked improvement in 
local government finances is expected from 
this year onwards, with a return to perceptible 
surpluses. In addition, the relief measures Further budget

2 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report. A more de -
tailed analysis of the longer-  term development of local 
government finances can be found in Deutsche Bundes-bank, Local government finances: Development and se -
lected aspects, Monthly Report, October 2016, pp 13-36.
3 New entities were evidently added to the reporting 
group in this state. For the same reason, there is likely to 
have been a marked acceleration in expenditure growth 
too.4 Once asylum has been granted, expenditure on refugees is largely covered by central government (basic allowance).Deutsche Bundesbank

should also result in greater fixed asset forma -
tion by local government. The fund to promote 
municipal investment, which is set to increase 
by a further €3½ billion, should also contribute 
to this.
In the reformed debt statistics,5 local govern -
ment (including its off-  budget entities) re -
corded a debt level of €150 billion6 at the end 
of the third quarter of 2016. While the amount 
of cash advances outstanding (€51½ billion)7 
fell slightly, other liabilities grew by just under 
€1 billion. However, there might have been mere shifts between the debt categories, as 
was evidently the case with past local govern -
ment bond issuances in North Rhine-  
Westphalia. For some years now, Saarland, 
Rhineland-  Palatinate, North Rhine-  W estphalia 
and Hesse have recorded particularly large local government cash advances for their municipal -
ities on aggregate. A marked easing of the situ -
ation, although desirable, was not yet in sight 
in the third quarter – indeed, Saarland actually 
reported another perceptible increase in this 
type of debt.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2016, gross issuance in the Ger -
man bond market stood at €75.5 billion, lag -
ging behind the previous month’s figure of 
€97.5 billion. Nonetheless, after taking account of redemptions, which were also down (€71.5 
billion), and changes in issuers’ holdings of 
their own debt securities, the outstanding vol -
ume of domestic bonds rose slightly by a net €2.4 billion, after having contracted by €6.4 
billion in October. By contrast, the outstanding 
volume of foreign debt securities in the Ger -
man market fell by €2.3 billion, which meant 
that the outstanding volume of domestic and 
foreign debt securities in Germany increased by just €0.1 billion on balance.The public sector issued own bonds totalling €8.0 billion net in the reporting month, with 
central government increasing its capital mar -
ket debt by €6.7 billion on balance. It issued 
mainly ten-  year Feder al bonds (Bunds) and 
two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) in 
the amount of €4.7 billion and €4.6 billion re -
spectively. It also sold five-  year Feder al notes 
(Bobls) to the tune of €0.6 billion, while re -
deeming 30-year bonds worth €0.3 billion net. 
State governments issued bonds with a net 
value of €1.3 billion.

market debt by €5.2 billion in November. Most Debt rose

5 The Federal Statistical Office’s press release of 28 Sep -
tember 2016 states that the reporting group in the quar -

marked as provisional.6
 Debts owed to third parties, ie all public and non-  public 
sector lenders apart from other municipalities and munici-
pal special-  purpose associations.

notably, the outstanding volume of debt secur -
ities issued by specialised credit institutions 
(which include public promotional banks, for 
example) fell by €3.4 billion on balance. There 
were also net redemptions of public Pfand -
briefe as well as other bank debt securities that 
can be structured flexibly (€1.8 billion and €1.1 
billion respectively). By contrast, mortgage 
Pfandbriefe worth €1.1 billion net were issued.
Domestic enterprises also scaled back their 
capital market debt in November (by €0.4 bil -
lion). On balance, this decrease is mainly due to 
net redemptions of commercial paper.
The Bundesbank was ultimately the sole buyer 
of debt securities in November, acquiring bonds 
in the amount of €18.7 billion net under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes, 
amongst other things. The main sellers of debt securities were foreign investors, who disposed 
of a net €14.2 billion worth of such instru -
ments. However, German credit institutions and domestic non-  banks likewise offloaded  
debt securities worth €2.5 billion and €1.8 bil -
lion net respectively. While the credit institu -
tions chiefly parted with German securities, the 
non- banks exclusively sold foreign securities.
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares total -
ling €0.7 billion net were issued in the German equity market, the majority of which emanated 
from listed enterprises. Sales of foreign shares 
in Germany amounted to €3.2 billion in the 
same period. Domestic non-  banks dominated  
the buyers’ side of the market, adding shares 
worth €3.2 billion net to their portfolios. Resi -
dent credit institutions acquired equities in the 
amount of €0.7 billion net, whereas non-  
resident investors sold domestic shares worth 
€0.1 billion.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of 
€11.1 billion in November. Specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the main 
beneficiaries (€9.0 billion). Of the various asset 
classes, mixed securities funds attracted the 
most investment (€5.6 billion). Funds of funds, 
real estate funds and equity funds also sold 
shares (€1.9 billion, €1.7 billion and €1.5 billion 
respectively). Meanwhile, foreign mutual funds 
recorded redemptions of €0.8 billion net in the 
German market. On balance, domestic non-  
banks were the sole purchasers of mutual fund 
shares in the reporting month (€12.8 billion). 
German credit institutions redeemed shares for 
€0.6 billion net, and foreign investors offloaded 
mutual fund shares worth €1.1 billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €24.6 billion in November 2016, putting it 
€5.2 billion above the October level. This was Net redemptions

partly driven by an increase in the goods ac -
count surplus and a boosted invisible current 
transactions balance comprising services as 
well as primary and secondary income.
In November, the surplus on the goods account 
was up on the month by €3.2 billion to €24.3 
billion, with exports rising more strongly than 
imports.
Invisible current transactions recorded a mod -
est €0.3 billion surplus in November, compared with a deficit of €1.7 billion one month earlier. 
This turnaround was mainly due to a halving of 
the services account deficit by €1.8 billion to €1.8 billion, which in turn was principally at -
tributable to the downturn in travel expend -
iture typical for this time of year. Moreover, net receipts in the primary income item saw a slight 
rise of €0.4 billion to €6.1 billion, whereas the 
secondary income deficit went up marginally 
by €0.2 billion to €4.0 billion.
In November, events on the international finan -
cial markets were dominated by the outcome 
of the US elections as well as expectations that 
the US Federal Reserve would raise rates in De -
cember, which is indeed what happened. All in 
all, German cross-  bor der portfolio investment 
generated net capital exports of €14.9 billion, 
mainly on account of further disposals of Ger -
man securities by foreign holders (€15.5 billion 
in November after €16.2 billion in October). 
These investors chiefly sold German money 
market paper worth €13.6 billion in net terms. 
They also parted with mutual fund shares (€1.1 
billion) and bonds (€0.7 billion). By contrast, 
resident investors shed only a small amount of 
foreign securities from their portfolios (€0.6 bil-lion). They sold debt securities (€2.3 billion) and 
mutual fund shares (€0.8 billion), while bolster -
ing their holdings of foreign shares by €2.5 bil -
lion.
Direct investment continued to record net cap-
ital exports in November, though down on the 
month from €16.0 billion to €2.3 billion. In the

eign investment on the part of domestic com-
panies (€9.1 billion), with around two-  thir ds of 
this outlay being spent to boost equity capital 
abroad. These firms also channelled funds to 
their foreign subsidiaries through intra-  gr oup 
lending, relying almost exclusively on trade 
credits to do so. Conversely, there was a trend 
reversal in foreign enterprises’ funding of their 
affiliates in Germany inasmuch as these non-  
resident firms provided their affiliates with 
funds to the tune of €6.8 billion, after having 
reduced such funding by roughly the same 
amount one month previously. The bulk of 
these funds were distributed using intra-  gr oup 
loans (€6.1 billion), primarily in the form of fi -
nancial loans from fellow affiliated companies.
Ultimately, net capital exports (€8.0 billion) 
were also recorded for other statistically re -
corded investment, comprising loans and trade 
credits (where these do not constitute direct in-
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other 
investments. However, non-  banks recorded net inflows of funds (€1.5 billion). Capital imports 
recorded by general government (€3.9 billion) 
contrasted with capital exports on the part of 
enterprises and households (€2.4 billion). In 
contrast to this, monetary financial institutions 
(including the Bundesbank) recorded net cap -
ital outflows (€9.5 billion), not least thanks to 
the €34.8 billion rise in the Bundesbank’s net 
claims on non-  r esidents. This in turn was mainly 
the result of an increase in claims within its 
large-  value payment system TARGET2 (+€46.0 
billion), the highest increase since January 
2015. By contrast, there was an upturn in the 
volume of other central banks’ sight deposits 
held with the Bundesbank (€11.3 billion). Con-
versely, banks’ transactions, notably steps taken 
to whittle down their deposits with foreign 
counterparties, led to net capital imports (€25.3 billion net).

The Eurosystem’s bond purchases and the 
exchange rate of the euro
In January 2015, the Governing Council of the ECB announced an expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (APP) and thereafter twice extended its duration besides increasing the monthly volume 
of purchases. The aim of the programme is to bring inflation in the euro area back up to rates that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Theoretical considerations suggest that 
there are a number of mechanisms through which asset purchases should be instrumental in 
achieving the desired effect. These mechanisms are aimed directly at investors’ portfolio decisions and market players’ monetary policy expectations; the relevant adjustments may also indirectly involve a depreciation of the euro.
Against this background, the present article is concerned with the impact of the Eurosystem’s 
bond purchases on the euro’s exchange rate. To this end, we first look at how the exchange rate responded on the dates on which the Governing Council of the ECB took its decisions on the asset purchase programme. In this context, the considerable depreciation of the euro on the day the APP was adopted is particularly striking; a larger daily fall in the euro’s effective exchange rate had been recorded only once previously.
This is all the more notable considering that market expectations about such measures had 
already led to the euro depreciating in the preceding weeks. There are, however, numerous inher -
ent difficulties in quantifying the effects that changes in expectations about the APP had on the euro’s exchange rate. For example, a depreciation of the euro tends to reflect not only the quan -
titative easing of the Eurosystem, but also its standard policy measures as well as the gradual 
tightening of the monetary policy stance in the United States during the same period. A study 
conducted at the Bundesbank attempts to take into account the aspects raised as far as possible; this identifies a 4.7% depreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro and a 6.5% depreciation of the euro against the US dollar since 2014 as the aggregate effect of direct and 
expectation formation-  r elated market reactions to the decisions taken by the ECB Governing 
Council on purchasing government bonds.
Besides the effects of the decisions to buy assets and related expectations, this article considers 
the potential exchange rate effects of the Eurosystem’s actual purchase operations. To do this, the report presents two alternative empirical studies. Both are consistent in concluding that the Euro -
system’s asset purchases themselves have not achieved any significant additional exchange rate effects beyond the cited announcement effects and corresponding expectations.Deutsche Bundesbank

The Eurosystem’s asset pur -
chase programmes since au-
tumn 2014
Given repeated negative surprises with regard 
to the rate of inflation and declining inflation 
expectations in the euro area, in September 
2014 the Governing Council of the ECB began 
taking step-  by-  step measur es that can be sum -
marised under the heading of “quantitative 
easing”.1 First, it announced the asset-  backed  
securities purchase programme (ABPSPP) and the third covered bond purchase programme 
(CBPP3).2 The net volumes of the securities ac -
quired by the Eurosystem on the basis of these two programmes were still relatively small with 
monthly totals of between €1.1 billion and 
€13.6 billion.
In January 2015, the Governing Council of the 
ECB adopted the expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (APP), which comprised the public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP) in addition 
to CBPP3 and ABSPP . Given the large volume 
and the liquidity of the outstanding sovereign 
bonds, the PSPP allowed the Eurosystem to greatly expand its purchases of securities. It 
was initially planned that purchases under the 
APP would have a monthly volume of €60 bil -
lion. The programme was originally scheduled 
to last until September 2016 with purchases to -
talling €1,140 billion; in December 2015, the 
period was extended until March 2017, raising the intended overall volume of the programme 
by €360 billion. In March 2016, the monthly 
purchases were raised to €80 billion, which ex -
panded the overall volume of the programme 
by a further €240 billion. Besides the asset classes that were already eligible, the pro -
gramme now also made provision for buying 
bonds issued by non-  bank corpor ations. Finally, 
in December 2016, a further extension of the 
programme’s duration with monthly purchases 
of €60 billion between April and December 
2017 was announced. This represented an add-itional increase of €540 billion in the intended volume of purchases.Transmission channels of 
quantitative easing via the 
exchange rate
The Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes 
cited above were adopted with the aim of bringing price developments in the euro area into line with the Governing Council’s defin -
ition of price stability. How far this goal is 
achieved depends in part, however, on how 
and how strongly the euro’s exchange rate 
reacts to the measures taken; this is because a depreciation of the euro increases the prices of imported goods, thus placing upward pressure on prices in the euro area, whereas an appreci -
ation of the euro tends to dampen domestic inflationary pressure. Theoretically, there are various conceivable mechanisms through which quantitative easing by the Eurosystem 
can influence the euro’s exchange rate.
One of these mechanisms is the portfolio rebal -
ancing channel. This posits that domestic and 
foreign securities are not regarded as being en-
tirely identical (substitutable) in the eyes of in -
vestors in terms of their risk content, say, or 
their liquidity. Under this assumption, a bond purchase by a country’s home central bank 
leads not only to a reduction in the bonds held 
in the domestic private sector, but also to an increase in the price/decline in the yield of these securities. This will prompt investors to adjust their portfolios by acquiring inter alia  
foreign bonds, thereby generating net outflows Buying

chase programmes in earlier years as part of the monetary policy response in coping with the financial, economic and sovereign debt crisis, but their volumes were comparatively small. These include covered bond purchase programmes 1 and 2 (CBPP1 und CBPP2) as well as the securities markets 
programme (SMP).Deutsche Bundesbank

of capital which, in turn, bring about a depreci-
ation of the domestic currency.3
The described sequence of events makes it 
clear that the portfolio adjustment in question and the resulting depreciation of the domestic 
currency is initiated only if there is sufficient scope for a corresponding reduction in the 
yield. Declining yields, in turn, set incentives for 
the issuers to expand their debt and borrow 
additional funds through new issues. If such a 
reaction occurs,4 the decline in the yield and, 
therefore, the effect on the exchange rate is 
weakened.
The signalling channel is a further mechanism 
through which asset purchases can impact on 
the exchange rate. This channel operates in 
such a way that market players could construe 
the announcement of quantitative easing as a 
signal that the monetary policy stance is going 
to remain expansionary for longer than previ -
ously expected and that future money market 
rates, too, will therefore stay low for longer. 
This, in turn, would bring current capital mar -
ket rates under pressure. Much like with the 
portfolio rebalancing channel, such develop -
ments would tend to provoke net outflows of 
capital and a depreciation of the domestic cur -
rency.
Besides the two channels already mentioned, a 
further mechanism is occasionally cited, which 
is also known as the “confidence channel”.5 
This posits that the central bank’s announce -
ment of asset purchases can also have an im -
pact on investors’ attitude towards risk. As a 
result of such an announcement, for example, 
the view that the outlook for growth at home is less favourable than hitherto supposed might 
gain ground among market participants.6 This 
would lead to a rise in risk premiums. Con -
versely, in a setting where heightened uncer -
tainty already exists, the central bank’s meas -
ures might strengthen investors’ confidence, 
thus lowering the risk premium. This last-  
named effect could, all other things being 
equal, provoke inflows of capital, thus weaken -ing the depreciation of the domestic currency 
induced through the other channels.
For quantitative easing actually to lead to the 
theoretically expected depreciation of the do -
mestic currency, it is necessary for the trading 
partners also to allow a corresponding appreci -
ation of the partner currencies. They might try 
to neutralise the expected capital inflows with 
their own expansionary –  standard or non-  
standard – monetary policy measures or even 
introduce or strengthen capital controls. De -Any issuing 
activity weakens exchange rate effect

3 The Governing Council of the ECB was also quick to 
point out such portfolio rebalancing effects having an im -
pact on the exchange rate; as, for instance, ECB President 
Draghi said at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress on 
21 November 2014, “Substitution of assets can also take 
place across jurisdictions, which would take the form of 
investors rebalancing portfolios away from euro-  
denominated assets towards other jurisdictions and curren -
cies providing higher yields. For example, there is evidence 
that both the various Large Scale Asset Purchase pro -
grammes of the Fed as well as the Bank of Japan’s Quanti -
tative and Qualitative Easing programme led to a signifi -
cant depreciation of their respective exchange rates, even 
in a situation in which long-  term yields wer e already very 
low, as in Japan.”
4 In actual fact, the Eurosystem’s eligible assets database 
shows, for instance, that the outstanding volume of bonds 
issued by central governments in the euro area showed a 
net rise of €405 billion between the end of 2014 and mid-
2016. More than €300 billion of this was due to net issu -
ance by Italy, France and Spain. This contrasts with a vol -
ume of government bonds purchased under the PSPP in 
the total cumulative amount of €885 billion over the same 
period. This suggests that the programme’s foreseeable ef -
fects on the yield and the exchange rate as a result of port-
folio adjustments would have been perceptibly greater 
without this net issuance. In this connection, the German 
Council of Economic Experts writes in its annual report 
(Jahresgutachten) 2016, p 212, “Bei niedrigen Zinsen ergibt 
sich ein Anreiz, den Konsolidierungsprozess aufzuschieben. So könnten die bisherigen Zinssenkungen bereits zu höher als geplanten staatlichen Ausgaben beigetragen haben  …” 
[“With low interest rates, there is an incentive to postpone 
the consolidation process. The interest rate cuts so far 
could already have contributed to public expenditure being 
higher than planned …”.] The ECB Financial Stability Re -
view, November 2016, p 31, states: “ … fiscal reform ef -
forts appear to have lost momentum as urgency has dwin -
dled amid low sovereign financial market stress.”5 See M Fratzscher, M Lo Duca and R Straub (2013), On the international spillovers of US quantitative easing, ECB Work -
ing Paper 1557, as well as M Fratzscher, M Lo Duca und 
R  Straub (2016), ECB unconventional monetary policy: 
 market impact and international spillovers, IMF Economic 
Review 64, pp 36-74.
6 Such a reaction is discussed, for example, in connection 
with the US  Federal Reserve’s first asset purchase pro -
gramme in 2008 and 2009, but is found not to be substan -
tiated. See C J Neely (2011), The large-  scale asset pur chases

St. Louis Working Paper 2010-018C.Deutsche Bundesbank

fensive measures of this kind are often motiv -
ated by the worry that the appreciation of their 
currency could impair their economy’s price 
competitiveness or exert a deflationary im -
pulse. If the partner currency is pegged to the euro by a fixed exchange rate, the foreign cen-
tral bank is bound – on institutional grounds alone – to undertake foreign exchange inter -
ventions in order to prevent an appreciation of 
its currency. Monetary easing measures in part -
ner countries that are adopted in the same 
period as the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
grammes do not necessarily have to be under -
stood as a response to them. Global develop -
ments such as a fall in oil prices which – via 
second-  r ound effects – lead to the outlook for 
inflation deviating worldwide from the in -
tended target, may make expansionary policy 
measures seem advisable in different currency 
areas independently of each other.
Exchange rate reactions on 
the day the Eurosystem de-cides on the public sector asset purchase programme
As information that has a bearing on exchange 
rates can be processed quite rapidly on the for -
eign exchange markets, it is to be expected 
that Governing Council decisions on purchas -
ing assets are reflected in marked exchange 
rate movements almost as soon as they are an -
nounced. To measure this effect, the rate of 
change in the nominal effective exchange rate 
of the euro over a period of one day is often 
used; this is calculated as a trade-  w eighted 
average of nominal bilateral rates between the 
euro and a large number of other currencies. 
The European Central Bank fixes the euro for -
eign exchange reference rates on every trading 
day based on a point-  in-  time snapshot at 1 4.15 
CET. When the decisions of the Governing Council are made public at the press confer -
ence, which starts at 14.30 following the Gov -
erning Council meeting, the time until the ref-
erence rate is determined on the next day 
therefore spans a period of almost 24 hours.A comparison of the daily rates of change in 
the euro’s effective exchange rate does indeed 
suggest that information connected with the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme can quite obviously trigger substantial exchange 
rate reactions over the short term. This is evi -
dent alone from the fact that, of the six largest daily falls in the euro’s effective exchange rate 
against the currencies of 38 trading partners 
since the euro was launched in 1999, three are 
closely related to the APP .7 For example, the 
euro’s effective exchange rate fell by 1.7% be -
tween 22 October 2015 and the following day 
after the Governing Council announced that 
the degree of monetary policy accommodation 
would need to be re-  examined at the Decem -
ber monetary policy meeting. This announce -
ment was construed in the markets as hinting 
at a forthcoming monetary policy easing, per -
haps also by means of marked expansion of 
the purchase programme. The effective ex -
change rate of the euro underwent a fall of a 
similar magnitude of 1.6% between 14 and 
15 January 2015 when the Swiss National Bank 
discontinued the minimum rate of the Swiss 
franc against the euro in anticipation of the 
ECB Governing Council initiating a large-  scale  
asset purchase programme.
However, the euro’s effective exchange rate 
sustained a very heavy loss – of 2.6%, its 
second-  lar gest loss ever – on the day the Gov -
erning Council announced the APP , ie between 
22 and 23 January 2015. This strong depreci -
ation of the euro’s effective exchange rate re -
sulted from broadly based losses against a large 
number of partner currencies. The currencies 
which have the highest weight in calculating 
the effective exchange rate of the euro are 
largely identical with those that played the larg -
est part in the depreciation. This suggests that events outside the euro are hardly likely to have Effective

7 Two further falls, including the largest ever effective daily decline in the history of the euro at 2.9%, occurred at the 
height of the global financial and economic crisis in late 2008 and early 2009; finally, a further fall can be noted during the period of widespread scepticism about what 
was then still the new euro currency in spring 2000.Deutsche Bundesbank

contributed to the fall in the effective exchange 
rate.
Even so, the euro by no means depreciated 
uniformly against different currencies. The eu -
ro’s daily loss against the US dollar amounted 
to 3.6%, for example, which means that 22 to 
23 January 2015 also saw the euro’s second-  
largest daily depreciation in its bilateral ex -
change rate against the US dollar since the sin -
gle currency was introduced. Against the cur -
rencies of other major trading partners from 
outside Europe and Eurasia (China, Japan, Rus -
sia, South Korea and Turkey), the euro likewise 
depreciated by between 2.9% and 4.0%.
Against west and central European currencies 
(the euro area’s most important trading part -
ners: the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, 
Switzerland and the United Kingdom), by con -
trast, the depreciation was consistently weaker. 
This was partly due to the fact that some Euro -
pean countries, such as Denmark, as members of ERM  II, peg their curr encies to the euro and 
allow only very narrow fluctuations against it. 
The authorities of other countries intervened in 
the foreign exchange markets on a more or less 
discretionary basis against their own curren -
cies, thus preventing them from appreciating against the euro. Finally, the high degree of 
economic integration within Europe may be ac-
companied by a stronger co-  movement of the 
currencies concerned. This can be explained, 
say, by economic cycles within Europe being

grammes to make large-  scale pur chases of 
assets for the first time in March 2009.8 The US 
dollar’s effective exchange rate fell by 2.3% on 
18 March 2009, the day the decision was an-
nounced.9 As early as 5 March 2009, the Bank 
of England announced its decision to use the 
asset purchase facility. In this instance, too, 
there was a marked depreciation, ie a fall of 
2.5% in the pound sterling’s effective exchange 
rate, albeit only with the rate of change from 
the following day onwards.10 Thus, the depre-
ciation of the euro following the APP decision 
is within the range also observed in other cur -
rency areas in connection with decisions to 
purchase assets.
Since asset purchases under the APP com -
menced on 9 March 2015, the programme has 
been expanded considerably on three occa -
sions, as mentioned above. The corresponding 
decisions were taken at the Governing Council 
meetings dated 3 December 2015, 10 March 
2016 and 8 December 2016. The first two deci -
sions concerned packages of measures which, 
besides expanding the APP , comprised a further 
cut in policy rates as well as additional non-  
standard measures. Nevertheless, the effective 
exchange rate of the euro was markedly higher 
one day after each of these decisions (by 1.6% 
and 1.5% respectively), whereas it was down 
by 1.2% one day after the Governing Council meeting in December 2016. However, for the 
March date, it should be borne in mind that

8 As early as November 2008, however, the Fed had taken 
a decision to initiate a programme to purchase large vol -
umes of mortgage-  backed securities and dir ect obligations 
of housing-  r elated government-  sponsor ed enterprises.
9 In order to improve comparability, the effective exchange 
rate of the US dollar is calculated here against the same broad range of currencies that is used to determine the 
effective exchange rate of the euro. As the decisions of the 
Federal Open Market Committee have generally been re-
leased, since March 2013, at 14.00 Eastern Standard Time 
(Eastern Daylight Time), which corresponds to 20.00 Cen -
tral European Time (Central European Summer Time), the 
observation period of just under 24 hours is reduced by 
roughly one-  quarter when using eur o foreign exchange 
reference rates. On the financial market effects of the first 
US asset purchase programme, see, for example, J Gag -
non, M Raskin, J Remache and B Sack (2011), The financial 
market effects of the Federal Reserve’s large-  s cale asset 
purchases, International Journal of Central Banking 7(1), 
pp 3-43; the exchange rate reactions are analysed inter alia 
in C J  Neely (2015), Unconventional monetary policy had 
large international effects, Journal of Banking and Finance 
52, pp 101-111.10 The rate of change amounting to -2.5% is calculated in 
turn from the effective exchange rates of the pound ster -
ling against the same basket of currencies on Friday 
6 March and on Monday, 9 March 2009. From 5 March to 
6 March, a 0.3% appreciation of the pound sterling was 
recorded. Even if the depreciation of the pound sterling up to 9 March was due entirely to the Bank of England’s mon -
etary policy decisions on 5 March, a qualification that has to be borne in mind is that, simultaneously with the deci-sion on the asset purchase facility, there was a ½ percent -
age point cut in the Bank of England’s base rate. A detailed account of the financial market effects of quantitative eas -
ing in the United Kingdom may be found, for example, in

sions regarding the asset purchase programme 
– unlike in the past – had already been made 
public in a press release at 13.45, ie before the 
euro foreign exchange reference rates were de -
termined at 14.15.11 In the intervening half-  
hour, ie as an immediate response to the press 
release, the euro depreciated against major 
currencies. Yet even for the rate of change over 
two days (from 9 to 11 March 2016) there was 
still a 0.6% appreciation in the euro’s effective 
exchange rate.12 What would appear, at first 
glance, to be a counter-  in tuitive response by 
the exchange rate to quantitative easing can be 
explained, at least in part, by the fact that mar -
ket participants had already been expecting ex -
pansionary measures from the Governing 
Council, with the impact on the euro being dic -
tated by how far the actual measures taken dif -
fered from the previously-  held expectations.Expectation and

Neither the decision on the APP dated 22 Janu-

11 Previous to this date, the substance of press releases 
had been confined to policy rate decisions by the Govern-
ing Council. Press releases thus contained no information 
on non-  standar d monetary policy measures. Similarly, the 
decision dated 8 December 2016 to extend the programme had been made public earlier (at 13.45) in a press release. Here, too, it makes sense to measure from 7 to 9 Decem -
ber to determine the exchange rate reaction. Over this 
period, the effective exchange rate of the euro depreciated by 1.0%.12 Now proceeding to analyse the exchange rate reaction 
from 9 to 10 March on account of the press release would 
have the disadvantage of disregarding the impact on the 
euro of the ECB press conference on 10 March (scheduled for the usual time of 14.30), which provided further back -
ground on the decisions regarding the APP .Deutsche Bundesbank

ing of monetary policy. If such expectations are 
formed or if, in the eyes of market participants, 
the probability of an expected easing measure 
increases, this ought to be directly reflected in 
a depreciation of the euro.13 On the day of the 
decision itself, then, the euro should have re -
sponded only to the extent that the measures 
taken deviate from those expected on average. 
This makes the euro’s strong reaction on 
22 January 2015 all the more remarkable. By 
contrast, to determine the overall impact of the 
asset purchase programme on the euro ex -
change rate, it would then be necessary, how -
ever, to consider not just the reaction to the 
decisions themselves, but also the exchange 
rate effects attributable to news from the 
period before the decision which had a major 
bearing on the formation of expectations sur -
rounding any potential forthcoming quantita-
tive easing measures.
Against this backdrop, it is useful to begin by 
considering euro exchange rate developments in the months leading up to the introduction of 
quantitative easing and the period since then. 
A corresponding time series reveals, for in -
stance, that the euro experienced a perceptible 
and rather steady loss in value against the US 
dollar between mid-2014 and 23 January 2015, 
which is one day after the decision to launch the APP was taken. The euro dwindled from 
just under US$1.37 on 30 June 2014 to as little 
as US$1.12 on 23 January 2015. On balance, this equates to a depreciation of the euro by 
18.0%. Although the euro suffered further 
marked losses in value at times (including in the first half of March 2015), the subsequent quar -
ters saw the EUR/USD rate moved sideways, 
fluctuating within a range of between US$1.05 
and US$1.16. The single currency came under 
pressure after the presidential elections in the Developments

United States in November 2016 and was trad -
ing at US$1.07 as this report went to press.
Developments in the nominal effective ex -
change rate of the euro14 followed a similar 
pattern, with the euro depreciating by 10.4% 
against the currencies of 19 major partner 
countries between 30 June 2014 and 23 Janu -
ary 2015. However, this exchange rate did not 
move as smoothly as the bilateral EUR/USD rate 
during this period. Thus, the effective exchange rate of the euro remained almost static on bal -
ance between mid-  September and mid-  
December 2014, before suffering a particularly 
substantial loss in value up to 23 January 2015. 
Although the effective euro rate likewise de -
preciated again in the first half of March 2015, 
it has tended to creep up again ever since, but 
especially from the beginning of December 
2015 onwards, with the result that the effective 
exchange rate of the euro of late was up by 
2.6% compared with 23 January 2015.
The next question concerns the extent to which 
developments in the euro’s exchange rate dur -
ing this period, in particular its sharp depreci -
ation in the months running up to the APP de -
cision dated 22 January 2015, can be attributed 
to mounting expectations in foreign exchange 
markets, driven by new information, that quan -
titative easing measures were increasingly likely 
in the euro area. However, quantifying the cor -
responding impact is extremely difficult on sev-
eral counts and generally fraught with consid -
erable uncertainty.15
The quantification process quickly comes up against its first challenge because ECB press 
conferences or speeches by members of the 
Governing Council containing remarks on asset 
purchases normally also address standard mon -
etary policy and, in some cases, other non-  
standard measures as well. Moreover, decisions 
on quantitative easing were, in some instances, 
combined with other non-  standar d and stand -
ard monetary policy measures. A similar situ -
ation arises when the wording of a speech 
points to an increase in the degree of monetary policy accommodation without indicating 
whether standard or non-  standar d policy meas -
ures are being considered. In all these cases, it is unclear whether it was really the remarks or decisions on the APP which triggered a poten-tially observable depreciation in the euro.
Two instances of standard and non-  standar d 
policy measures being jointly adopted were the 
Governing Council decisions on the expansion 
of the APP dated 3  December 2015 and 10  March 2016, which –  as previously men -
tioned – also included a cut in the deposit facil-ity rate. In the press conferences held after the 
respective preceding monetary policy meetings 
of the Governing Council on 22 October 2015 
and 21  January 2016, ECB  President Mario Draghi’s introductory statement already con -
tained remarks which could be interpreted as 
hinting at the possibility of forthcoming monet -
ary easing measures. In his introductory state -
ment on 21 January 2016, ECB President Draghi 
said the following. “It will therefore be neces -
sary to review and possibly reconsider our 
monetary policy stance at our next meeting in 
early March […]. In the meantime, work will be 
carried out to ensure that all the technical con -
ditions are in place to make the full range of 
policy options available for implementation, if 
needed.” Remarks of a similar nature were also … and the

14 Unlike the previous section, which focused on achieving 
the broadest-  possible geogr aphical coverage on individual 
days and therefore used the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro against a broad group of 38 currencies 
(EER-38), the section below is based on the nominal effect-ive exchange rate of the euro against 19 partner currencies (EER-19). This is because the official EER-38 is not available 
on several days owing to public holidays, which makes it 
unsuitable for conducting a time series analysis based on 
daily data. The differences between the two effective ex -
change rates of the euro on the individual days mentioned in the last section are minimal. The depreciation of the euro 
from 22 to 23 January 2015 came to 2.5% according to EER-19 (instead of 2.6% based on EER-38); the appreci -
ation from 3 to 4 December 2015 amounted to 1.4% (in -
stead of 1.6%), the appreciation from 9 to 11 March 2016 in both cases was measured at 0.6%, and the depreciation from 7 to 9 December 2016 was 0.9% (instead of 1.0%).15
 This is also highlighted in S  D’Amico (2 016), Discussion 
of “The financial and macroeconomic effects of the OMT 
announcements”, International Journal of Central Banking, 12 (3), pp 59-68, for cases where expectation effects play a major role.Deutsche Bundesbank

made on 22  October 2015.16 That kind of 
wording obviously encompasses both standard 
and non-  standar d measures, with the result 
that any exchange rate reaction cannot be un-
ambiguously pinned on the APP .
In response to these statements, the euro did 
indeed depreciate markedly – both in effective 
terms and bilaterally against the US dollar – 
from 22 to 23 October 2015 and from 21 to 
22 January 2016. In effective terms against 38 
major trading partners, the first of these ex -
change rate movements even saw the fifth-  
heaviest daily loss ever, as stated above. An ap -
preciation of the euro on the dates of subse -
quent monetary policy meetings at which the 
expansionary measures were actually decided 
can be interpreted as a disappointment of some market participants’ ambitious expect-
ations.
High frequency data can sometimes provide 
further insight, albeit to a limited extent, into 
the exchange rate effects of individual meas -
ures. One example of this can be seen on 
4 September 2014, when the Governing Coun -
cil decided to purchase asset-  backed securities 
and covered bonds, but also to cut policy rates 
by 10 basis points. This policy rate cut had al -
ready been made public at 13.45 in the form of 
a press release; however, the decision on the 
asset purchases was not announced until the 
press conference, which started at 14.30. The 
press release caused a severe exchange rate re -
action. In the five minutes following its publica -
tion, the euro shed almost 1 US cent (a loss of 
0.72%) against the US dollar, and there was no 
correction of any note in this movement by the 
time the press conference began. Five minutes 
into the press conference, the reaction was a 
great deal more subdued (-0.27%) and the ex -
change rate bounced back by half within the quarter of an hour that followed. Only after 16.30 did the euro resume a more sustained 
downward movement. The intra-  day exchange 
rate movement thus implies that the euro’s ex -
change rate over the course of 4 September 
2014 was probably driven less by the Eurosys -tem’s adoption of quantitative easing, but 
mainly by the cut in policy rates.17
Another challenge when it comes to quantify -
ing expectation and announcement effects lies 
in determining the point in time at which the 
foreign exchange market received new infor -
mation about future quantitative easing meas -
ures and which statements can even be classi -
fied as new information. Amongst other things, this concerns interviews and speeches by mem-
bers of the Governing Council that only relate 
to quantitative easing in as far as they reiterate 
the substance and, in many cases, the exact 
wording of what has already been said else -
… as well as 
decisions on ABSPP and CBPP3 in the light of high 
 
frequency dataSec

16 It was worded as follows. “In this context, the degree of 
monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-  
examined at our December monetary policy meeting […]. 
The Governing Council is willing and able to act by using all 
the instruments available within its mandate if warranted in 
order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary ac -
commodation.”17 While the fixing of the euro foreign exchange reference 
rate at 14.15 may, on the face of it, appear to be an appro -
priate point in time to separate the two events, the rate of 
change in the euro’s exchange rate from 3 to 4 September 
2014 contained barely half an hour’s reaction to the press release, whereas the rate of change from 4 to 5 September 
2014 encompassed a reaction to the press conference of 
almost 24 hours. In addition, it is completely unclear 
whether the depreciation of the euro late in the afternoon of 4 September 2014, which had a bearing on the rate of change from 4 to 5 September 2014, can be traced back to the press conference or the press release. A situation simi -
lar to that on 4 September 2014 existed in principle on 
3 December 2015, when the cut in the deposit facility rate had already been made public in the press release at 13.45, 
but the expansion of asset purchases was not revealed until the press conference which started at 14.30. How -
ever, the above-  mentioned r ate of change in the foreign 
exchange reference rate of the euro against the US dollar from 3 to 4 December 2015 was more obviously driven by 
the direct exchange rate reaction at the beginning of the 
press conference.Deutsche Bundesbank

where, mainly at ECB press conferences.18 In 
this context, information can only really be as-
sumed to be new for the markets if market par -
ticipants were expecting a different statement. 
In any case, it appears problematic to attribute movements in the euro’s exchange rate on the 
corresponding days to the expectation effects 
of quantitative easing.19
There is also disagreement over the window in which it can be assumed that the observed ex -
change rate movement is determined exclu -
sively or largely by the new information. On the one hand, asset prices such as exchange rates 
ought to respond swiftly to new information in 
a highly liquid market. On the other, market 
participants need to be granted a certain 
amount of time to process indications of quan-titative easing or an expansion thereof, as such 
information will in many cases have no com -
parable precedents and hardly be standardised. 
There is no doubt that the length of this win -
dow can have quite a substantial bearing in -
deed on the measured overall effect of the pur -
chase programme on the exchange rate. In the 
present case, this is mainly true for the period 
until March 2015, when the euro depreciated 
relatively continuously over several weeks. In 
event studies conducted on the impact of non-  
standard monetary policy measures on the ex -
change rate, the chosen window ranges be -
tween half an hour20 and two days21 in length.
There is a possibility, especially in cases where a 
longer window is used to measure how the ex -
change rate reacts to the announcement, that 
new macroeconomic data will be released dur -
ing that window which also have an impact on the exchange rate. In this case, the two effects 
would overlap, thus distorting the estimated 
impact of the purchase programme. Added to this is the fact that the released data are some-
times factored into the decision-  making pr o-
cess on monetary policy measures. This makes 
it even more difficult to isolate the individual 
effects on the exchange rate. The literature ap -
plies two alternative strategies to minimise any 
distortions this might cause in the results. The first of these –  as mentioned above  – is to 
measure the exchange rate reaction in just a 
very short window. However, this might result 
in the market reaction being understated by 
far. For instance, movements in the euro’s ex -
change rate over the course of the days on 
which the most important APP-  r elated deci -
sions were made do not give the impression 
that the response process was already over 15 
Third challenge: 
assumptions about the 
 
window during 
which new information affects the euro exchange rate
Fourth  challenge:  
impact of macroeconomic data releases …… 
and ways of 
eliminating this effect
18 One example of this is an interview which Europe 1 
conducted with ECB President Mario Draghi on the morn -
ing of 24 September 2014 in which Mr Draghi, when asked 
about additional stimulus measures, made the following 
remarks. “… I can say that the Governing Council is unani -
mous in its commitment to use the available instruments 
within its mandate to bring inflation back to close to but 
below 2%.” No further remarks concerning non-  standar d 
monetary policy were made in the interview. However, 
President Draghi’s introductory statement to the ECB press 
conference on 4 September 2014 already contained the 
statement that “… in line with our aim of maintaining in -
flation rates below, but close to, 2%. … Should it become 
necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period 
of low inflation, the Governing Council is unanimous in its 
commitment to using additional unconventional instru -
ments within its mandate.” From 23 to 24  September 
2014, the euro depreciated by 0.5% against the US dollar. 
It appears doubtful whether – with reference to the inter -
view – this depreciation can be traced back solely to a sus -
pected increase in market participants being convinced 
that potential additional quantitative easing measures 
would be introduced in the future.
19 To get a better idea of the extent to which announce -
ments of quantitative easing come as a surprise to market 
participants, some studies look at the immediate response 
of long-  t erm government bond futures. Given that such 
measures aim at lowering long-  term government bond  
yields, an unexpected statement in this regard – one which fuels expectations of a swift adoption of government bond 
purchases, say – can be expected to drive up the prices of 
futures of this kind. Studies which use this procedure to 
determine the exchange rate effects of asset purchase pro -
grammes include the following. R Glick and S Leduc (2013), 
The effects of unconventional and conventional U.S. mon -
etary policy on the dollar, Federal Reserve Bank of San Fran-
cisco Working Paper 2013-11; J  H  Rogers, C  Scotti and 
J H  Wright (2014), Evaluating asset-  market effects of un -
conventional monetary policy: a multi-  country r eview, Eco -
nomic Policy 29, pp 751-799; and J  H  Wright (2012), What 
does monetary policy do to long-  term inter est rates at the 
zero lower bound?, Economic Journal 122, pp F447-F466.
20 In these studies, changes in the exchange rate are 
measured from ten minutes before a spoken remark or publication to 20 minutes after, or from a quarter of an 
hour before to a quarter of an hour after such an event.

21 See, for example, the broad window used in Altavilla et 
al (2015), op cit, or Joyce et al (2011), op cit, who even use

or 30 minutes after these decisions were made 
public.22
The second strategy for preventing macroeco -
nomic data releases from distorting results is to 
explicitly factor them into estimates. Since fo -
rex market participants form expectations in advance not only over information on the monetary policy stance but also over macro-
economic data, only the surprise component of the release should be used here.
23 But this kind 
of approach will not necessarily eliminate the 
above-  mentioned distortions in their entir ety 
either because it cannot be taken for granted 
that the effect of macroeconomic surprises will 
remain constant over time,24 and that effect 
might also hinge on the central bank’s monet -
ary policy stance. The response shown by the 
euro’s exchange rate to an unexpectedly low 
rate of consumer price inflation, for example, 
might be more pronounced if the market al -
ready has the impression that the Eurosystem is 
considering quantitative easing measures. The 
chart discussed above showing the euro’s 
heaviest daily losses, however, puts the import-
ance of such reasoning into perspective insofar 
as –  at least in the past few years  – it was 
seemingly not so much macroeconomic data 
releases as monetary policy decisions which 
drove the biggest changes in the euro’s ex -
change rate.
One final, materially important aspect to con -
sider when quantifying the overall effect of 
quantitative easing decisions has to do with an exchange rate’s function as a relative price be -
tween currencies. As such, it is determined, by 
its very nature, not only by the monetary policy 
stance in the domestic economy, but in a simi-
lar fashion by monetary policy developments 
abroad as well. On this score, monetary policy 
developments in the United States are of ut -
most importance, not just for the bilateral 
EUR/USD exchange rate but also for the effect -
ive exchange rate of the euro. The period since mid-2014, which was marked by the decisions 
to successively increase the degree of monetary 
accommodation in the Eurosystem, has seen the US  Federal Reserve gradually tighten its 
monetary policy. Taken by itself, this, too, acted 
to drive down the value of the euro, just like 
the Eurosystem’s easing measures, with the re-
sult that the effects tended to overlap. While 
this is counteracted by the fact that the most 
important pieces of news about adjustments to 
the Fed’s monetary policy path were not made 
public on the same days as those of the Gov -
erning Council, there is nonetheless a degree 
of risk, especially in the months leading up to 
March 2015, of wrongly identifying expect -
ations regarding the Eurosystem’s quantitative 
easing measures (rather than US monetary pol -
icy) as a significant contributor to the euro’s quite steady depreciation observed at that time. That risk is intensified especially when 
movements in the euro’s exchange rate over a 
comparatively long window are attributed to 
individual Eurosystem announcements and 
when very large numbers of at times relatively 
insignificant announcements are used to ex -
plain them.
The reasoning set out above illustrates that it is 
almost impossible to precisely determine the 
overall effect of the Governing Council’s deci -
sions regarding quantitative easing on the eu -
ro’s exchange rate in a way that also takes into 
account the formation of expectations in for -
eign exchange markets. Hence, any estimate 
made in this regard will be fraught with a high 
degree of uncertainty. A study conducted at 
the Bundesbank which attempts to incorporate Fifth challenge: 
impact of US monetary policyF
or all the 
uncertainty, a drop of around 4½% in the effective exchange rate of the euro can be identified as a response to the APP deci-sions and earlier APP-
 
related 
information
22 For that to have been the case, the euro’s exchange 
rate ideally ought to have levelled off once those 15 or 30 
minutes had elapsed. Yet in every single instance, the ex -
change rate movement observed during this window in -
stead continued beyond the window, albeit subject to 
some volatility.
23 Technically, this is done by deducting the median re -
sponse to a survey conducted among financial market 
 experts shortly prior to the data release from the value that 
is actually released, so that a surprise component remains.

Expectation and announcement effects of the expanded 
asset purchase programme on the euro’s exchange rate: an event study
It is never easy to measure how monetary 
policy measures affect fi  nancial market 
prices with any degree of precision because 
market players are continually forming ex-
pectations about the future path of monet-
ary policy, and any changes in their expect-ations impact directly on those prices. Ana-
lysts looking to gauge how far fi  nancial 
market prices have been infl  uenced by ex-
pectation and announcement effects sur-
rounding the expanded asset purchase pro-gramme (APP) therefore need to investigate 
how market expectations about the pur-
chase programme – for example, the likeli-hood of it being implemented, as well as its 
design, possible launch date and volume – 
have evolved over time.
These expectations are not readily observ-able in practice, so analysts tend to use 
event studies to measure the overall effect 
of a policy measure on fi  nancial market vari-ables. Event studies identify what are known 
as “event windows” – periods in which 
market opinion about a particular purchase 
programme might have changed. In the 
present case, suitable events would appear 
to be information made public by the ECB 
on the topic of the APP . Pages 22 to 26 of 
the main article explain why the analysis presented below is confi  ned to ECB press 
conferences and press releases that follow 
Governing Council meetings on monetary 
policy matters which are very likely to have 
a bearing on the euro’s exchange rate. 
Event windows are each one day long, not only to mitigate the risk of data being “con-
taminated” by other factors, but also to 
give market players enough time to react to the information made public by the ECB.
Once the relevant events have been identi-
fi  ed, the rate of change shown by the ob-served variables – in this case the euro’s ex-
change rate – between the beginning and 
the end of the defi  ned event window is 
measured. Assuming that the information made public on the purchase programme was the sole factor infl  uencing the ex-
change rate during the event window, the 
measured change in the exchange rate can 
be attributed in full to the APP . By exten-sion, it is possible to quantify the pro-gramme’s overall effect on the euro’s ex-
change rate by adding together the changes across all the event windows.
One criticism that can be levelled at this procedure used in classic event studies is 
the possibility that economic metrics (con-
cerning the unemployment rate, say, or in-
dustrial production) were made public on 
the same day as the events. If such informa-
tion had an independent effect on the eu-
ro’s exchange rate, a classic event study will deliver distorted results.
In their estimation of the effects of the Eu-
rosystem’s purchase programme on fi  nan-
cial market variables, Altavilla, Carboni and 
Motto (2015) include the surprise compon-
ent of a host of macroeconomic releases 
from the euro area and the United States in an effort to segregate that component’s in-
fl  uence from that of the asset purchases.1 
Specifi  cally, this approach – an event study 
which “controls” for macroeconomic re-
leases – estimates the following regression 
for each time series under observation:

We will now outline the results of a study 
that follows the approach used by Altavilla 
et al (2015) but with an observation period that extends into December 2016.
3 The re-
gression equation shown above is esti-
mated for the euro’s nominal effective ex-
change rate4 and, as an alternative, for its 
exchange rate against the US dollar.
An event study approach will inevitably have a degree of leeway in the choice of 
relevant events. The present analysis makes a distinction between two phases compris-ing nine APP- related events in all, shown in 
the chart on page 15 under numbers 3-5 
and 7-12. The fi  rst phase covers the APP de-
cision on 22 January 2015 as well as two earlier press conferences in which refer-
ences were made to the Governing Coun-
cil’s intention to take measures that would have a sizeable impact on the balance sheet (6 November 2014 and 4 December 2014). 
The second phase, meanwhile, encom-
passes press releases and press conferences 
for Governing Council meetings that were associated with programme adjustments which provided additional expansionary stimulus. These comprised, fi  rst, the press 
conferences on 3 September 2015, 22 Oc-
tober 2015 and 3 December 2015, which resulted in the term of the programme being extended; second, the press confer-ences and press releases on 21  January 
2016 and 10 March 2016, which ultimately 
led, inter alia, to the monthly asset pur-
chase volume being increased; and, third, the press conference and press release on 
8 December 2016 announcing the decision to extend the programme by nine months.
5
Altogether, the nine monetary policy events 
mentioned above were associated with a considerable same- day fall in the value of the euro, even after eliminating the infl  u-ence of possible macroeconomic surprises 
on the event days. After controlling for this 
infl  uence, the estimated overall effect thus 
2 The time series were obtained from the data pro-
vider Bloomberg and express the difference between 
the value made public and the median analyst forecast 
value, divided by the standard deviation of the under-lying projections. The macroeconomic metrics notably comprise releases on industrial production, the labour market and price developments.3 The regression analysis is thus based on an observa-
tion period from 2  January 2014 to 15  December 2016. This approach differs again from Altavilla et al (2015), op cit, in that it uses a far more restrictive 
 selection of events considered relevant, particularly in 
the period prior to the decision to launch the APP on 
22 January 2015 and also because it explicitly takes 
account of the infl  uence of US monetary policy on the euro’s exchange rate. Both studies use daily data and 
the same series of macroeconomic surprises in their 
estimations.
4 The nominal effective euro rate against the curren-
cies of 19 major trading partners of the euro area, which is calculated on the basis of the euro foreign 
exchange reference rates, is used here.5 If the press conferences on 4 September 2014, 2 Oc-tober 2014, 8 September 2016 and 20 October 2016 
had also been factored into the analysis, they would 
have had relatively little bearing on the results. The es-
timated fall in the nominal effective euro rate would 
have been 0.3 percentage point larger and that of the 
EUR/USD rate 1.6 percentage point larger. A problem 
of a more fundamental nature, however, is the fact 
that some event days saw the announcement of other 
monetary policy measures unrelated to the APP . As a 
case in point, three- quarters of an hour before the 
press conference on 4 September 2014 a press release announced a 10 bp reduction in the ECB’s three main policy rates.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
January 2017

comes in at -4.7% for the nominal effective 
euro exchange rate against the currencies 
of 19 major trading partners and at -6.5% 
for the euro’s exchange rate against the US 
dollar. F tests conducted on the results indi-cate that both effects are signiﬁ  cant at the 5% level.
As the adjacent chart shows, the ﬁ  rst phase 
of the Eurosystem’s quantitative easing 
measures in particular – up to and including 
the APP announcement – saw a distinct fall 
in the euro’s value. Later announcements 
extending the term of the APP and increas-ing the monthly purchase volume tended to have weaker effects on the whole.
6
These results should, however, be viewed in light of the fact that the observation period also saw the euro depreciate discernibly on 
days other than the event days analysed here, with the euro’s effective exchange 
rate falling by 9.6% on balance and its ex-
change rate against the US dollar losing as much as 24.5%. This raises the question of 
whether what is, potentially, a substantial portion of this development might be ex-plained by gradually mounting market ex-
pectations about the introduction and, sub-sequently, about the expansion of quantita-
tive easing measures by the Eurosystem, but without necessarily being able to pin 
this on speciﬁ  c events in the shape of new information made public.
7
However, any such considerations need to 
allow for the fact that the monetary policy 
actions of the US Federal Reserve, and not 
just monetary policy developments in the 
euro area, are likely to have had a consider-
able impact on the euro’s exchange rate against the US dollar in particular.
8 There 
were mounting signs during the observa-
tion period that US monetary policy was re-turning to normal, culminating, ﬁ  rst, in the 
tapering of and exit from asset purchases and ﬁ  nally, from the end of 2015, in two 6 The purchase volume of the three decisions to in-
crease the volume and extend the term of the APP to-
talled €1,140 billion overall, which was exactly the 
same volume as that of the original APP decision; 
however, the effect measured for the second phase is smaller than that of the ﬁ  rst. Added to this, of the six events from the second phase, only one (on 8 Decem-ber 2016) was not also connected with a standard eas-
ing of monetary policy. Thus, since the effect meas-ured for the second phase can be traced back to a 
combination of policy rate cuts and quantitative eas-
ing, it must be assumed that the undeterminable, hypothetical effect of the quantitative easing alone 
was smaller than indicated in the estimate.7 An exchange rate trend like the one seen primarily in the ﬁ  rst phase observed here could be better captured 
by an event study, eg by also factoring a host of less 
obviously relevant events into the regression analysis. 
For instance, Altavilla et al (2015), op cit, identify 17, 
rather than just three, relevant events for this ﬁ  rst 
phase alone. The overall effect they calculate for the 
ﬁ  rst phase – a 5% euro depreciation against the US dollar – is nevertheless barely higher than the ﬁ  gure 
we come to for the same phase. But they do also re-port results for a two- day event window (ie exchange rate movements on two consecutive days are assigned 
to each of the 17 events), which means that they achieve even broader trend coverage and thus con-
clude that the overall effect for the ﬁ  rst phase alone is 
a 12% euro depreciation against the US dollar which 
can be attributed to the APP .8 While there is a series for this in the set of macroeco-
nomic surprises, it does not contain a single surprise 
for the entire observation period.Estimated controlled APP expectation and announcement effects

policy rate hikes. Much like the Euro system’s 
easing measures, a gradual tightening of 
the monetary reins in the United States will 
tend to push down the value of the euro.
The estimation seeks to model monetary policy symmetrically in the two foremost 
currency areas by also incorporating seven 
selected press releases from the US Federal 
Reserve which contained new information on the path of monetary policy. These re-leases are listed in the table above. Evi-
dently, making this information public also 
sent the euro sharply lower in value. The 
estimated overall effect of this slight tight-
ening of US monetary policy across both 
phases was a 4.0% drop in the euro’s nom-inal effective exchange rate and a 6.8% fall 
in the euro’s value against the US dollar (both effects being signifi  cant at the 5% level). This suggests that while events re-lated to the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme had a major bearing on the euro’s exchange rate, under no circum-stances should other factors –  fi  rst and foremost monetary policy in the United 
States – be ignored. It is therefore possible 
to measure this effect more accurately by confi  ning events to those most obviously 
relevant to the APP and by not being overly generous in setting the length of the event window.
As a caveat, it is worth noting that the re-
sults generated with the aid of event stud-
ies of this kind should be interpreted with some caution. One reason for this was 
mentioned above – the fact that it is virtu-
ally impossible to clearly and unambigu-ously identify events relevant to the APP . 
Another is that the high degree of exchange 
rate volatility on event days makes events 
very sensitive to the underlying event win-
dow. The length of the event window, in 
particular, has a major bearing, but even if a 
different daily rate were used – that is, if the event window were shifted but re-
mained 24 hours in length – the results of 
the estimation might be substantially differ-
ent. The results presented here, for in-stance, are based on euro exchange rates measured at 14.15 Central European Time 
(CET). If rates at 23.00 CET are used instead, 
for example, the estimated effect of the APP on the  euro’s exchange rate against 
the US dollar is a mere -2.2% (rather than 
-6.5%). One possible reason for this is that 
these daily rates capture an exchange rate 
reaction over just 8½ hours (rather than al-most 24 hours when euro foreign exchange 
reference rates are used) from the start of 
each ECB press conference.Selected press releases by the

the issues raised as extensively as possible25 
finds that the overall effect since 2014 of the 
direct and expectation formation-  r elated mar -
ket reactions to the decisions taken to date by 
the Governing Council on government bond 
purchases has been a 4.7% depreciation in the 
nominal effective exchange rate of the euro 
and a 6.5% depreciation of the euro against 
the US dollar.26
Much of this effect, relatively speaking (2.6 per -
centage points in the effective exchange rate 
of the euro and 4.2 percentage points bilat -
erally against the US dollar), is accounted for by 
the period up to the end of January 2015 – a 
spell in which market participants were increas -
ingly anticipating government bond purchases 
and the APP decision was passed. The meas -
ures which expanded the programme, on the 
other hand, tended to have less of an impact 
on the euro’s exchange rate. In addition, it is 
presumably not even possible to pin all these 
estimated smaller depreciation effects on the 
expansion of the APP as there is no way of dis -
tinguishing them from the effect of cuts in the 
deposit facility rate that were occasionally de -
cided at the same time.
On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that 
the actual exchange rate effect up until the 
APP decision in January 2015 was slightly larger 
than estimated because, as mentioned above, 
the study took into account only the most im-
portant pieces of new information relating to 
potential asset purchases. The study does, 
however, suggest that –  compared with this 
lack of clarity – other factors had more of a 
bearing on the path followed by the euro’s ex -
change rate. One notable such factor was US 
monetary policy, which was gradually tight -
ened throughout the observation period and 
caused the euro to depreciate by an estimated 6.8% against the US dollar (and by 4.0% in ef-
fective terms). In terms of magnitude, this is 
comparable to the estimated effects of the 
quantitative easing in the euro area.When assessing the estimated announcement 
and expectation effects of the APP on the ex -
change rate of the euro, it should be noted 
that the present analysis does not allow any conclusions to be drawn with regard to the 
APP decision

Gradual tighten-
ing of US mon-etary policy more or less a factor of similar magnitude in euro depreci-ation as APP measuresAnalysis says nothing about the persistence of effects
25 Following the reasoning outlined here, the change in 
the euro’s exchange rate over the course of a trading day is attributed to a new piece of information about the APP 
(from the daily fixing of the euro foreign exchange refer -
ence rate prior to the announcement up to the one there-
after). All in all, this study takes nine APP-  r elated announce -
ments into account. As a rule, these are ECB press confer -
ences, partly in conjunction with ECB press releases, and 
three of these took place in the period before the govern -
ment bond purchases began in March 2015. The influence of macroeconomic data releases and US monetary policy is 
factored into the calculation of the effects. A detailed 
description   of the estimation can be found in the box on  
pp 27-30.26 The result is not materially different (5.0% depreciation 
in the effective exchange rate of the euro and 8.0% bilat -
erally against the US dollar) when four additional ECB press conferences, and thus inter alia all the dates listed on p 15 up until 22 January 2015, are included in the estimate. That 
said, even the number of nine “event days” originally se -
lected to cover the APP decision and APP expansions ap -
pears to be rather high compared with similar studies. For 
example, Neely (2015), op cit, uses five event days to 
capture   the exchange r ate reaction to the adoption and 
expansion of the first US asset purchase programme; Joyce et al (2011), op cit, base their estimate of the effects of the first UK purchase programme, including expansions, on six 
event days. The overall effects we identified are consider -
ably smaller than those cited in European Central Bank, The 
transmission of the ECB’s recent non-  standar d monetary 
policy measures, Economic Bulletin, Issue 7/  2 015, pp 32-51, 
with reference to Altavilla et al (2015), op cit, for the period from 4 September 2014 to 5 March 2015 alone – that is to 
say, the period up to the beginning of the government bond purchase operations. According to that study, the 
APP’s overall effect until that time already came to an 8% depreciation of the euro in effective terms and a 12% bilat -
eral fall in value against the US dollar. Those findings mainly 
differ from the results presented here because that esti -
mate is based on as many as 17 event days just for that short phase and because developments in the euro’s ex -
change rate in a window as long as two days are attributed to the respective events. The study by Altavilla et al (2015), op cit, though, also presents results of an estimation based on only a window of one day for the euro’s exchange rate reaction. Under this assumption, it arrives at a result which, 
in terms of magnitude – a 5% depreciation of the euro against the US dollar – is similar to the study presented 
here for the corresponding period. Another finding made 
in the Bundesbank study shows how far the length of the 
window used to measure the reaction of the euro’s ex -
change rate influences the estimated overall effect. Using 
daily euro rates fixed at 23.00 instead of those at 14.15 (which implies that the period from the start of the ECB 
press conference at 14.30 up to the fixing of the exchange rate is distinctly shorter) results in the euro depreciating by 
only 2.2% overall against the US dollar, rather than by 
6.5%, although the duration of the exchange rate reaction attributed to each event remains unchanged at one trading day.Deutsche Bundesbank

persistence of the effects identified.27 Thus, the 
estimated 4.7% nominal effective depreciation 
of the euro may persist on a lasting basis, but it 
might just as well have unwound within a short 
space of time. This makes it more difficult to 
determine, for example, the extent to which a 
measured change in the euro’s exchange rate 
over a given period can be attributed to the 
effect in question.
Effects of the asset purchase 
operations
The expectation and announcement effects of 
the APP , which also include the immediate ex -
change rate reactions on the day of APP-  r elated 
decisions by the Governing Council, need to be 
distinguished from the effects of putting those 
decisions into practice, ie those stemming from 
the asset purchases themselves. Government 
bond purchases under the APP started on 
9  March 2015, while purchases of covered bonds and asset-  backed securities, which like -
wise form part of the broader APP programme, 
began back in October and November 2014 
respectively  . However , there is a longer obser -
vation period available to analyse the effects of 
asset purchase operations in the euro area, 
given that the Eurosystem had already con -
ducted purchases of covered bonds and gov -
ernment bonds between 2009 and 2012, albeit 
with the primary objective back then of safe -
guarding the functioning of the monetary pol -
icy transmission process. Even though the Euro-system’s holdings which originated from these 
earlier purchase programmes are gradually re -
ceding, they still amounted to a combined total 
of around €185 billion at the end of 2014.28 Eurosystem

The onset of government bond purchases 
under the PSPP , especially, sent the Eurosys -
tem’s holdings of securities for monetary policy purposes sharply higher to €1.7 trillion, all told, 
by mid-  January 2016.
There are some studies in the literature which 
assume that it is not only expectation and an -
nouncement effects, but also the actual pur -
chases themselves, that influence variables such as the exchange rate.
29 They argue that 
the supply of government bonds available to 
private investors only decreases once the actual 
purchases are made, so while market partici -
pants may have been informed in advance 
about the point in time and volume of the in -
tended purchases, it is entirely possible for their 
expectations regarding the effectiveness of these central bank operations to be fraught 
with uncertainty and error. Equally uncertain is 
the extent to which private investors reinvest the proceeds from the sale of bonds to the 
central bank in the alternative assets available 
in each case.
The European securities holdings statistics by 
sector30 can be used to gain a clearer picture of 
whether purchase operations under the APP 
triggered a portfolio shift into foreign asset 
holdings via the portfolio rebalancing channel, 
as would be expected in theory, and thus gen -
erated any downward pressure on the euro. A 
breakdown of the corresponding holdings 
shows that the holdings of euro-  d enominated 
bonds in the portfolios of investors excluding 
the Eurosystem declined in the one-  and-  a-  half 
years between the end of 2014 and mid-2016. 
The statistics reveal that it was particularly non-  
euro-  ar ea residents which engaged in consider -
able net sales of PSPP-  eligible bonds during this 
period. Sellers were chiefly private investors from the United States and the United King -
dom, the majority of whom are presumably 
financial   sector participants. F urthermore, 
China’s   public sector (centr al bank and general 
government) decreased its holdings signifi -
cantly. Assuming the proceeds from these sales 
were invested in non-  eur o-  denominated assets, this should, in itself, have exerted downward 
pressure on the euro. Analysis of the aggregate 
bond holdings which non-  eur o-  ar ea residents 
hold in custody within the euro area indicates 
that this may well have been the case.31 Their 
holdings of euro-  denominated bonds did in -
deed decrease sharply from the beginning of  2015 to mid-2016, while bond holdings 
denominated   in other curr encies increased 
markedly.
Since actual purchase operations under asset 
purchase programmes in other currency areas 
have been shown to have a marked impact on 
the exchange rate, and because the Eurosys -
tem’s securities holdings data point to the pos-
sibility of an APP-  induced shift into for eign cur -
rency bonds, the Bundesbank conducted simi -
lar analyses of Eurosystem bond purchases in 
an effort to measure their effect. These ana-
lyses generally take into account not just APP 
asset purchases but those carried out under earlier Eurosystem purchase programmes 
(CBPP , CBPP2 and SMP) as well. Two alternative 
econometric methods were used in these ana -
lyses.
The first of these is a Bayesian vector autore -
gression (BVAR) model. The analysis (see the 
box on pages 34 to 36) uses sign restrictions to 
identify quantitative easing measures. It con -
cludes, however, that these accommodative 
measures did not significantly affect the nom -
inal effective exchange rate of the euro during 
the observation period. But since this finding 
was achieved using monthly data, it would not Causes of poten-

Securities acquisitions within the Eurosystem’s purchase 
programmes: a BVAR estimation of the effects on the euro exchange rate
The following analysis uses a Bayesian vec-
tor autoregression model (BVAR) to deter-
mine the quantitative effects of securities 
purchases by the Eurosystem on the euro’s 
nominal exchange rate. In doing so, it es-sentially builds on the methodological ap-proach used by Boeckx et al (2014), who 
identify a monetary policy shock predomin-
antly by an expansion in the central bank 
balance sheet.1 However, in order to isolate 
the effects of the purchasing programmes 
as precisely as possible in accordance with 
the initial question, our analysis modifi  es 
this approach by concentrating on the de-
velopment of those balance sheet items 
which are determined by the purchase and redemption of securities.

The VAR model used to estimate the effects of non- standard monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate of the euro can be writ-ten in reduced form as follows
xt=c+pX
j=1Bjxtj+ut with t = 1, …, T .
xt represents an (Nx1 ) vector with endogen-
ous variables as described below; c denotes 
an (N x1) constant and Bj an (N xN) coeffi   -
cient matrix for the vector of endogenous 
variables lagged by j periods xt–j. The (Nx1 ) 
vector ut contains the error terms of the 
VAR model with E (ut) = 0 and covariance 
matrix E(utut‘) = Ω. As in the literature, 
the number of lags is set to p = 2 .3
In this VAR model, the vector of endogen-
ous variables is specifi  ed as
xt =[eurot assett lendt mrot yt pt vstoxxt]‘,where eurot represents the effective ex-
change rate of the euro against 19 major 
trading partners, assett the Eurosystem’s se-
curities holdings for monetary policy pur-
poses, lendt the Eurosystem’s liquidity pro-
vision for monetary policy purposes, mrot 
the Eurosystem’s main refi  nancing rate, yt 
the euro area’s industrial production, pt the 
euro area’s Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP), and vstoxxt the volatility index 
of the stock market index Euro Stoxx 50 
(VSTOXX).4
All the variables enter the model as loga-rithmic levels, with the exception of the 
main refi  nancing rate, which is modelled as a percentage. Since the Eurosystem lowered

2 The variable examined by Boeckx et al (2014), op cit, also contains balance sheet movements resulting from refi  nancing operations.
3 See Boeckx et al (2014), op cit and L Gambacorta, 
B Hofmann and G Peersman (2014), The effectiveness 
of unconventional monetary policy at the zero lower 
bound: a cross- country analysis, Journal of Money, 
Credit and Banking 46, pp 615-642.4 Thus, the dataset is broadly the same as in the stud-
ies by G Peersman (2011), Macroeconomic effects of 
unconventional monetary policy in the euro area, 
CEPR Discussion Paper 8348, Gambacorta et al (2014), 
op cit, and Boeckx et al (2014), op cit. In contrast to 
these studies, however, instead of modelling the Euro-system’s overall balance sheet, the two balance sheet 
items “Lending to euro area credit institutions related 
to monetary policy operations denominated in euro” 
and “Securities held for monetary policy purposes” are modelled separately. The former comprises all monet-
ary policy refi  nancing operations, while the latter 
shows the liquidity provision resulting from all the pur-chasing programmes. It should be noted here that the securities holdings for monetary policy purposes listed 
on the Eurosystem balance sheet are reported at amortised cost, and therefore only represent an ap-
proximation of the actual purchases. In order to iden-
tify a policy shock as precisely as possible, market 
interest rates, which may be infl  uenced by other fac-
tors, are excluded. The data used were obtained from Datastream, Haver and the ECB’s statistical data ware-house.Deutsche Bundesbank

the deposit facility interest rate to zero in 
July 2012, monthly data are used for the 
period from July 2012 to June 2016, so that 
the estimations deliberately cover the period in which the zero lower bound on interest rates was signifi  cant for monetary 
policy. The model is estimated using Bayes-ian methods, with the aid of a “dummy ob-servations prior”.

In order to identify a structural shock, the 
model is written out in structural form as
A0xt=a+pX
j=1Ajxtj+"t with t = 1, …, T.
A0 represents an (NxN ) matrix, where Aj = 
A0Bj, a = A0c and εt = A0ut. Here, εt ~ 
N(0,IN) with IN representing a unit matrix 
and E(utut‘) = (A‘0A0)–1 = Ω.
In order to identify a shock caused by quan-
titative easing by the Eurosystem, ie a QE shock, A
0 is chosen in accordance with 
Arias et al (2014)6 in such a way that the 
shock generates impulse response functions which comply with particular zero and sign 
restrictions over a given time horizon (see 
chart opposite).7 The restrictions chosen en-
able the shock to be attributed plausibly, 
and on sound economic foundations, to ex-
ogenous quantitative easing, thus separat-
ing it as clearly as possible from other 
shocks.
The bond purchases cause an increase in 
the balance sheet item “Securities held for 
monetary policy purposes”, which is why a 
positive sign restriction is imposed here. In 
order to separate bond purchases from refi  -
nancing operations with banks8, it is as-
sumed that the Eurosystem’s liquidity provi-sion for monetary policy purposes does not change in the event of a QE shock. In add-
ition, the shock is separated from conven-
tional monetary policy shocks by assuming that the main refi  nancing rate does not 
change contemporaneously. Since the esti-
mation is based on monthly data, it is also 
assumed that there are no contemporan-eous changes in industrial production or 
prices. This approach conforms to the view 
that these two variables only react to a 
monetary policy shock with a time lag. The 
negative sign restriction for the VSTOXX is 
intended to exclude the possibility that the shock might refl  ect an endogenous reaction 
5 The dummy observations prior used is based on the 
Minnesota prior and expands the dataset with artifi  cial data (dummy observations) containing the prior prob-
ability. In this case, the prior for the autoregressive  coeffi   cient is set to 1, since non- stationary data are 
used. The parameters for overall tightness, lag decay 
and exogenous variable tightness are set to 0.1, 1 and 100 respectively, in line with the usual values given in 
the literature. For more information, see M Bańbura,

market stress.9
Since this report concerns the exchange 
rate effects of quantitative easing, only the 
reaction of the exchange rate will be shown 
here. The chart above shows the impulse 
response function of the exchange rate as a result of a QE shock which expands the bal-ance sheet item “Securities held for monet-ary policy purposes” by an initial 1%.
10 The 
impulse response function gives the rate of change in the exchange rate, with the blue 
line representing the median reaction and the grey lines representing the 16th and 84th percentiles of the posterior distribu-
tions.
Although the impulse response function in-
dicates that the effective exchange rate of 
the euro against 19 major trading partners 
might depreciate as a result of the identifi  ed 
QE shock, this effect is not signifi  cant. Our analysis, therefore, reaches a different con-
clusion from studies such as those by, say, 
Boeckx et al (2014) and Wieladek and Pas-
cual (2016); this may be attributable to the different methods used to identify shocks.
11 
As mentioned above, Boeckx et al (2014) identify a non- standard monetary policy shock by a general expansion in the Euro-
system’s balance sheet. They therefore con-
sider a broader spectrum of monetary pol-
icy measures than securities purchase pro-
grammes alone. The fact that no signifi  cant 
impact was identifi  ed in our analysis, in 
contrast to Boeckx et al, could therefore in-dicate that the effects identifi  ed in the latter study are not exclusively attributable to the 
Eurosystem’s quantitative easing meas-
ures.12
Wieladek and Pascual (2016), on the other 
hand, concentrate on announcement ef-fects, whereas our BVAR estimation only 
takes into account the actual purchase op-
erations. Therefore, the results are not dir-
ectly comparable. Moreover, the present 
analysis covers several programmes, so that 
the identifi  ed effects accordingly represent 
an average of the various purchasing pro-
grammes implemented since 2012.
9 A restriction of this type is also used, for example, 
by  Gambacorta et al (2014), op cit, as well as by 
P Anaya, M Hachula and C Offermanns (2015), Spill-
overs of U.S. unconventional monetary policy to emer-
ging markets: the role of capital fl  ows, School of Busi-
ness & Economics Discussion Paper 2015/ 35, Freie 
Universität Berlin. In the study by Boeckx et al (2014), 
op cit, the ECB’s CISS indicator is used instead; how-
ever, this also refl  ects stress in foreign exchange mar-
kets. Since the present study concentrates particularly on exchange rate effects, the VSTOXX is therefore pre-
ferred. The results presented below do not change if 
no sign restriction is imposed on the VSTOXX.
10 This corresponds to an average growth of €3 bil-
lion.11 For more information, see J Boeckx et al (2014), op 
cit, as well as T Wieladek and A G Pascual (2016), The 
European Central Bank’s QE: a new hope, CEPR Dis-
cussion Paper 11309.
12 If the identifi  cation method used in the present 
study is unable to completely isolate the effects of pur-
chasing operations from announcement effects, the estimated exchange rate reaction, which is already 
low, might even be overstated.Response of the effective exchange rate of the euro to a QE shock

be possible to use this method to identify 
short-  term exchange rate r esponses to bond 
purchases that subsided again over the course 
of a month.
The second econometric method used to de -
termine the exchange rate effects of actual 
asset purchase operations by the Eurosystem is 
a regression analysis approach. This method 
had previously been applied in a similar fashion 
to analyse asset purchases carried out by the 
US Federal Reserve, where it provided evidence of distinct reactions in the US dollar’s exchange 
rate.32 One advantage of this approach is its 
exclusive use of financial market variables avail -
able at a high frequency, which allows it to 
capture short-  term exchange rate r eactions as 
well. However, when applied to the Eurosys -
tem’s asset purchase operations, this approach 
was likewise unable to identify a statistically significant effect on the euro’s effective ex -
change rate (see the box on pages 38 and 39), especially when the analysis is confined to the 
period of government bond purchases under 
the PSPP .33
This finding raises the question as to what fac-
tors might be driving these observations. It is conceivable, for instance, that the euro’s de -
preciation in the period leading up to March 2015 (which saw the start of the particularly 
large-  volume go vernment bond purchases), a 
movement which is sure to have been related 
to expectation and announcement effects 
associated   with the purchase programme, 
already   included all the effects of the pr o-
gramme on the euro’s exchange rate, including 
future ones, or even that it represented an overshooting on the part of the euro’s ex -
change rate.
Conclusion
Theoretical reasoning suggests that Eurosystem 
asset purchases ought to depress the value of 
the euro, and that was indeed the case on 
23 January 2015, one day after the Governing Council announced the APP , when the euro’s 
effective exchange rate sustained its second-  
largest fall on the day since the single currency was introduced. This is all the more remarkable given that market participants’ expectations in this regard had already helped send the euro’s 
exchange rate lower in the preceding weeks. 
However, it is extremely difficult to quantify the 
relevant effects, and thus a distinct margin of 
uncertainty remains.
The decisions passed by the Governing Council 
in December 2015, March 2016 and December 2016 to expand the asset purchases tended to 
exert less downward pressure on the euro, even after factoring in the exchange rate re -
sponse to the formation of expectations in the market. Furthermore, there are indications that 
non- euro-  area residents had markedly reduced 
their holdings of PSPP-  eligible bonds on bal -
ance by mid-2016, and that they had shifted their entire asset holdings held in custody in 
the euro area out of euro-  denominated assets 
into other assets. All other things being equal, this ought to have broadly put a strain on the 
euro. Two alternative analyses, however, sug -
gest that the Eurosystem’s actual purchase op -
erations had no significant additional effects on the effective exchange rate of the euro.… or by a

Securities purchases under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase 
programmes: a linear regression analysis of the euro’s  exchange rate
This article uses a regression analysis approach 
inspired by Fratzscher et al (2016)1 to estimate 
the effects of the Eurosystem’s actual pur-
chasing operations on the effective exchange rate of the euro against 19 major trading part-ners. Its methodology differs from that of the 
study described on pages 34 to 36. One dif-
ference is that, in order to identify the effects 
of the Eurosystem’s securities purchases, the 
following regression equation is estimated:
Δyt = c + α ΔASt + β∆Kt-1 + εt.
Let Δyt represent the percentage change in 
the euro’s exchange rate as a response vari-
able. Positive values refl  ect an appreciation of 
the euro. This is regressed on a constant (c) as 
well as on concurrent net bond purchases 
(ΔASt) and the fi  rst difference of control vari-
ables of the preceding period (∆Kt-1). The re-
gression coeffi   cients α and β describe the re-
lationship between the bond purchases (or 
the control variables) and the euro’s exchange rate; 
εt designates a disturbance term.
A second signifi  cant difference between this 
approach and the BVAR approach is that the 
current analysis is based solely on higher- frequency fi  nancial market data, meaning that it can also capture shorter- term exchange rate effects of Eurosystem bond purchases. To this 
end, either the daily or weekly data for the period July 2009 to June 2016 are used for 
the estimation. This means that the beginning of the time horizon for the analysis coincides with the beginning of the purchases of assets 
held by the Eurosystem for monetary policy purposes. The period is divided into several 
sections in order to analyse the robustness of the estimated results. Firstly, the entire period 
taken into account in this study is analysed. 
Secondly, the period during which the interest 
rate on the deposit facility stood at 0% or below (July 2012 to June 2016) is studied. 
Thirdly, the estimation is based on the period during which the Eurosystem purchased gov-
ernment bonds within the framework of the 
Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP), 
which ran from March 2015 to June 2016.
The time series for executed bond purchases 
is based on the holdings of securities for mon-etary policy purposes, which are published by 
the ECB in its weekly fi  nancial statements (in 
trillions of euro).2 The weekly infl  ows and out-
fl  ows are used directly for estimations made 
on a weekly basis. Alternatively, they are dis-
tributed evenly over the trading days in a 
week, as in Fratzscher et al (2013), to obtain 
corresponding daily data through interpol-
ation.3
As the time series is virtually linear in some places (see chart on page 32), an additional indicator variable is generated for asset pur-

chases. It takes the value of “1” in weeks of 
net asset purchases, “-1” in weeks of net re-
ductions of bond holdings, and “0” other-
wise. This series is used as an alternative to 
the actual time series for asset purchases.
To prevent potential endogeneity problems, only lagged values of the control variables listed in the table on page 38 are used. The 
control variables have the following functions 
within the regression analysis: VSTOXX and stock market indices cover the infl  uence of uncertainty (market risk) on the exchange 
rate. Additionally, the stock price indices and 
the long- term interest rates can monitor ex-
pectations with regard to future economic de-velopments. Exchange rate effects of conven-
tional monetary policy are covered by short- 
term interest rates.
As fi  nancial market data time series often suf-
fer from heteroscedasticity, the regressions for 
daily data are carried out with the aid of a heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation con-
sistent estimation procedure (HAC estimator), 
which results in a consistent estimation of 
standard errors even if the assumptions of the 
classical regression model are violated. The 
OLS method is used for weekly data estima-
tions.4
The results of the infl  uence of Eurosystem asset purchases on the effective exchange rate of the euro against 19 trading partners 
(see table above) reveal that the relevant coef-
fi  cient is generally insignifi  cant, regardless of 
the selected estimation period, the data fre-quency (daily or weekly data) or the regressor (asset purchase volumes or indicator variable). Slight indications of a signifi  cant infl  uence ap-pear at the 10% level if the maximum estima-tion period and daily data are used when ap-plying an indicator variable. In such cases, the 
regression coeffi   cient of asset purchases is negative, which corresponds to an effective 
depreciation of the euro in response to an ex-pansion of bond holdings. On the other hand, if observation is restricted to the period since the beginning of PSPP asset purchases, the re-
sults are consistently positive, apart from 
dummy series for weekly data, and are by no means statistically signifi  cant.
On balance, the estimations cannot prove that the Eurosystem’s actual asset purchase 
operations have affected the exchange rate of the euro.
5 However, the differing signs of the 
estimated coeffi   cients for alternative estima-
tion periods could suggest that the lack of sig-
nifi  cance is attributable to the inconclusive 
response of the euro to purchase operations 
over time.
4 Such series of tests for heteroscedasticity (eg those 
of Breusch- Pagan- Godfrey and Harvey) advocate a dif-
ferent approach for handling daily and weekly data.
5 Estimations for which the euro- US dollar exchange 
rate is used as the response variable instead of the  effective exchange rate of the euro present a similar 
picture. For this estimation, the percentage change in 
the S&P 500 as well as the fi  rst differences of the three- month swap rate on the US OIS rate and the 
yield on ten- year US Treasuries are used as control vari-ables.Estimated values for 𝛂 using alternative estimations

Recent developments in the indebtedness 
of the private non-  financial sector 
in selected euro-  ar ea countries
In the 2000s, against the backdrop of optimistic income expectations and favourable financing 
conditions, there was a marked rise in the debt levels of non-  financial c orporations and house -
holds in some euro-  ar ea countries. In the wake of the financial and economic crisis and the Euro -
pean debt crisis, the income situation was reassessed and the financing conditions were tight -
ened. The balance sheet mismatches that this uncovered revealed the need for balance sheet 
adjustments via a deleveraging process in the private non-  financial sector.
While deleveraging did not make much headway in the first few years after the onset of the crisis, 
it has accelerated considerably since 2012. Although there is a certain heterogeneity in the adjust -
ment progress from country to country and sector to sector, a significant portion of the pre-  crisis 
rise in debt ratios has, for the most part, already been corrected. However, the deleveraging pro-cess has not yet been fully completed. The decline in debt has been driven primarily by the active 
repayment of debt from current income. By contrast, stock-flow adjustments in the form of write-  
downs have, with few exceptions, played only a minor role. This is currently reflected in the levels 
of non-  performing loans on the books of the national banking systems, whic h for the most part 
remain high.
Historical examples suggest that the deleveraging process is faster where active deleveraging is 
accompanied by stock-flow adjustments. Economic developments in the euro area in recent 
years, which have been weak by international standards, are therefore likely to be at least partly 
attributable to the pronounced active repayment of debt from current income and the feedback effects this causes. However, stock-flow adjustments can also be accompanied by the misalloca -
tion of financial resources as a result of adverse incentives, as well as by heightened risks to 
financial stability. Insolvency frameworks are a prerequisite for a swift reduction in unsustainable debt via stock-flow adjustments. As these frameworks have undergone significant reform in recent 
years in most of the countries concerned, what matters now is their consistent application. An 
insolvency framework-  induc ed reduction in debt levels, which are still high in some cases, could 
provide the deleveraging process with additional impetus. At the same time, this would encour -
age the reallocation of resources and thereby support potential growth, provided institutional 
reforms are carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In the years prior to the onset of the financial 
and economic crisis there was an unsustainable 
rise in the debt levels of the private non-  
financial sector in some euro-  ar ea countries. In 
the wake of the crisis, a reassessment of in -
come prospects and asset valuations in all 
countries caught up in the European debt crisis 
revealed an extensive need for balance sheet 
adjustments in some cases. Households and 
non- financial corpor ations reacted to these bal -
ance sheet mismatches by reducing their debt 
levels.1
Deleveraging is of relevance for economic pol -
icy makers in general and for monetary policy 
makers in particular, above all because of the possible negative repercussions on the real 
economy and thus also on price developments. 
For example, historical studies show that reces-
sions accompanied by a necessary reduction in 
debt overhang are, on average, more pro -
longed and associated with markedly weaker economic activity.
2 In this adjustment phase, 
debtors in the private non-  financial sector use  
their income to a greater extent to reduce their debt. Even if this only results in a redistribution 
of funds from debtors to creditors, the likely 
effect is to curb macroeconomic consumption 
and investment, as creditors generally have a 
lower propensity to spend than debtors.3 In 
monetary policy terms, this means that expan-
sionary monetary policy measures to stimulate 
aggregate demand for goods via consumption 
and investment can, in such an environment 
requiring adjustment processes, have a com -
paratively weak effect or work comparatively more slowly, as long as balance sheet con -
straints impede demand from the private non-  
financial sector. In addition to the negative ef -
fects on economic activity, the reallocation of 
the capital stock to more productive value-  
added areas can be negatively affected by low 
investment, which in turn could lead to lower 
potential growth.Previous analyses of the debt situation of the 
private non-  financial sector in the eur o area 
concluded that the deleveraging process in the countries concerned following the onset of the 
financial crisis was rather weak in comparison 
to the typical path of previous deleveraging 
phases.4 Against this backdrop, this article 
documents how far the reduction in the debt 
overhang has progressed since 2012 and the 
adjustment channels through which it has oc -
curred. It also sets out potential implications of 
deleveraging for the real economy and draws 
conclusions for economic policy-  making.
Assessment of the private

Debt ratio over time
The debt ratio usually serves as the key indica -
tor for assessing the debt situation of the pri -
vate non-  financial sector – not least because of 
the good data availability and the high inter -
national comparability. It places sectoral debt 
– calculated on the basis of the financial ac -
counts and in the following defined as the sum 
of loans, debt securities, insurance technical

tic product (GDP).5 As debt is often repaid from 
current income, this indicator aims to show the 
long-  term economic sustainability of the debt. 
A low debt ratio implies that the debt stock of 
a sector stands in relation to a relatively high 
income that can be used to repay the debt. The 
sectoral aggregate data used here therefore do 
not take into account possible distribution ef -
fects relating to debt and assets within the in -
dividual sectors.
The adjacent chart shows the development of 
debt ratios for non-  financial corpor ations and 
households in countries heavily affected by the 
European debt crisis, namely Greece, Italy, 
Spain and Portugal, as well as in the two larg -
est euro-  ar ea countries, Germany and France.6 
The development of the euro-  ar ea aggregate is 
additionally shown as a benchmark. There was 
a strong rise in debt in the 2000s, particularly 
for non-  financial corpor ations and households 
in Spain and Portugal. Fairly strong upward 
momentum could also be seen for households 
in Greece until 2012, albeit starting from an ex -
tremely low level. By contrast, non-  financial  
corporations and households in Italy were char -
acterised by a somewhat more modest devel -
opment and a low debt level compared to 
other countries. On the other hand, German 
households, which were still the most indebted 
when the monetary union was founded, have 
gradually reduced their liabilities.
During the European debt crisis between 2010 
and 2013, the debt ratios of the private non-  
financial sector began to fall, particularly in 
Spain and Portugal. This process has acceler -
ated markedly since mid-2012. Compared to 
the respective peaks, there has been a substan-
tial reduction in the debt ratios among non-   
 financial corporations of just over 50 percent -
age points in Spain and around 30 percentage points in Portugal. Household debt ratios have 
fallen in each case by nearly 20  percentage 
points. Thus, in both countries, approximately Strong increase

5 In earlier publications the debt definition included only 
loans, debt securities and insurance technical reserves. 
Since the change-  o ver from the European System of Ac -
counts (ESA) 1995 to ESA 2010, it is now also possible to 
statistically isolate trade credits and advances, which are 
also debt instruments. For an account of the change-  over 
to ESA 2010, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Methodological 
changes in the financial accounts – background, approach 
and selected results, Monthly Report, October 2014, 
pp 13-26. The data are taken on an unconsolidated basis 
and thus include intra-  sector al liabilities such as loans be -
tween non-  financial corpor ations. Ideally, the intra-  sector al 
liabilities should be corrected to exclude intra-  gr oup liabil -
ities, as these do not represent a payment obligation in the 
stricter sense. However, as these cannot be distinguished 
from the remaining intra-  sector al loans on the basis of 
existing data sources, the debt level as relevant from an 
economic perspective tends to be overstated.6 The debt data are taken from the financial accounts com -
piled according to ESA 2010, as provided by the European 
Central Bank or the respective national central banks. For 
Italy, the backdata prior to 2012 are based on ESA 1995.

half of the increase in debt ratios recorded be -
tween the beginning of 2000 and the respect -
ive peaks has since been cut back.
By contrast, the debt ratios of the private non-  
financial sectors in Germany, Italy and Greece, 
which have rather low debt levels by inter -
national standards, as well as in the euro area 
as a whole have shown a persistent sideways 
movement in recent years. Only in France has 
there been a continuation of the slight, but 
persistent, upward trend. At the current end of 
the data, non-  fi nancial corporations in France 
have the highest debt ratio among all of the 
countries considered here.7 The sideways trend 
at the level of the euro area in recent years 
stands in contrast in part to the developments 
in other large economies (see box on pages 45 and 46).
Determinants of the change 
in the debt ratio
In order to be able to draw conclusions on the 
type of deleveraging process, the change in the 
debt ratio is broken down into the contribu -
tions of its sub-  components. The denominator 
of the debt ratio – GDP – is broken down into 
the contributions of real GDP and of the GDP 
deflator, ie an indicator of macroeconomic 
price developments; the change in the level of 
debt – the numerator in the debt ratio – is sub -
divided into three components: transactions, 
write-  downs and other changes.
Transactions correspond to active increases or 
reductions in debt. Stock-  flow adjustments  
made in the form of write-  downs ar e reduc -
tions in the nominal amount of existing liabil -
ities and take place, for example, as a result of 
loan renegotiations in the case of payment dif-
ficulties or outright defaults in the case of in -
solvency. As write-  d owns are not listed separ -
ately in the financial accounts, the data from the monthly balance sheet statistics of the 
monetary financial institutions (MFIs) are also 
taken into account. The information on write-  downs thus relates only to bank loans. How -
ever, as these usually make up a large portion 
of the aggregate indebtedness of the private 
non- financial sector , a significant share of all 
write-  downs should ther efore be covered by 
this.8 Other changes thus encompass all other 
factors that influence the debt level, except 
transactions and write-  downs. These include  
market price or exchange rate fluctuations, 
statistical changes to the debt level, and write-  
downs on debt instruments other than bank 
loans. The chart on page 47 shows the contri-
butions to the change in the debt ratio since 
the deleveraging process began to accelerate 
in mid-2012.
In all of the countries considered here, except 
Greece and Italy, both real GDP growth and the 
increase in the GDP deflator contributed to a 
reduction in the debt ratios. This means that 
the deleveraging process was supported by 
both economic developments and the increase 
in the price level. In Italy, by contrast, real eco -
nomic growth did not make any contribution 
to the fall in the debt ratio, as the economic 
recovery there has thus far been very weak. In 
Spain, where, alongside Portugal, the debt 
ratio of the private non-  financial sector has de -
creased the most over the last few years, a sub -
stantial part of the reduction in the debt ratio 
was due, in addition to active deleveraging, to 
write-  downs on bank loans. This was particu -
larly true for non-  financial corporations, and, to 
a somewhat lesser extent, for households, too.

7 As intrasectoral loans are of major significance in the 
cross-  country comparison and consist at least in part of  
intra-  g roup liabilities that are of no consequence to debt 
sustainability, the unconsolidated debt shown here should 
paint a somewhat too negative picture of the debt situ -
ation of non-  financial corpor ations in France. However, 
even after adjusting the debt ratio to exclude intrasectoral loans, a steady upward trend can still be observed and, at 
the current end of the data, France posts the second-  
highest value (after Portugal) of all countries under consid -
eration here.8 In the MFI balance sheet statistics, other adjustments are 
comprised of write-  downs and changes to the nominal 
value. As loans are not subject to market price fluctuations, 
other adjustments can be equated to write-  downs. See

Debt – an international comparison
While debt1 accumulated in the euro area 
in the 2000s, the United States as well as 
several major emerging market economies 
also saw an increase in debt levels, which, 
in 2008, culminated both in the real estate 
crisis in the United States and the global 
ﬁ  nancial  crisis. However, the euro area, the 
United States, the United Kingdom, Japan 
and the group of emerging market econ-omies have experienced very different de-velopments in the wake of the crisis, par-
ticularly in recent years.
Debt in the United States accumulated at a 
similar pace to that in the euro area. How-
ever, after peaking in 2008 at a debt ratio 
of 169%, this trend gave way – earlier than 
in the euro area – to a phase of delever-
aging, which lasted until 2012. In contrast 
to the situation in the euro area, this delever-
aging – like the accumulation of debt be-
fore it – was driven mainly by households. 
Since then, the debt ratio of the private 
non- ﬁ  nancial sector in the United States has remained largely constant, which can, as in the euro area, be attributed to the fact that 
nominal gross domestic product (GDP) has 
grown roughly in line with debt. However, 
back in 2012, the US debt ratio, at just under 150%, was already lower than the current level in the euro area (where it stood at 164% in the second quarter of 
2016).
Developments in debt in the United King-dom were similar to those in the United States, only more pronounced, on the whole. Households and non- ﬁ  nancial cor-porations in the United Kingdom contrib-
uted in roughly equal parts to both the ac-
cumulation and the reduction of debt. 
Somewhat later than in the United States, 
2010 saw the beginning of an intensive phase of deleveraging, which started at a 
debt ratio of 192% and has persisted up to 
the current end (in the second quarter of 
2016, the ratio was 163%). This can be at-
tributed to strong GDP growth and, at 
times, active deleveraging. Household debt, 
in particular, is currently still high by inter-
national standards, however.
Developments in Japan and in the group of 
emerging market economies were strikingly different. In Japan, the private non- ﬁ  nancial sector, predominantly the part consisting of

non- fi  nancial corporations, was very heavily 
indebted, with debt ratios of up to 220% in the 1980s and 1990s. In the mid-1990s, an 
adjustment process was set in train, in which the private non- fi  nancial sector underwent signifi  cant deleveraging, while 
government debt inversely started to grow 
and, as a percentage of GDP , currently ex-
ceeds other industrial countries’ levels. This 
development meant that Japan, unlike many other countries, experienced a de-cline in the debt ratio of the private non-   
 fi  nancial sector in the run- up to the fi  nan-
cial and economic crisis. Even after the 
onset of the fi  nancial crisis, which in Japan 
was accompanied by a slight increase in debt, a sideways movement started, with debt even, at times, declining somewhat. 
This was the result of broadly similar devel-
opments in debt and GDP . At 165%, the 
debt ratio of the private non- fi  nancial sec-
tor in Japan in mid-2016 was, however, still very high by international standards, which was attributable mainly to non- fi  nancial 
corporations.
Developments in the emerging market 
economies also diverged signifi  cantly from 
those in the United States, the United King-dom and the euro- area countries. Whereas debt levels in the private non- fi  nancial sec-
tor were still very low in the years leading 
up to the fi  nancial crisis and grew relatively 
slowly, a sharp increase started in 2008, bringing the debt ratio (currently 142%) close to that of the other countries under review. The muted GDP growth experi-enced in many emerging economies, par-
ticularly since 2015, was unable to keep up 
with the active accumulation of debt. The rise in debt was propelled mainly by non- fi  nancial corporations, whose current- end debt ratio, at 106%, has even exceeded that of non- fi  nancial corporations in the euro area. Given low interest rates in the 
industrial countries, large volumes of liabil-
ities denominated in foreign currency were 
established, thus increasing vulnerability to 
exchange rate fl  uctuations and changes in 
commodity prices. Among the emerging economies, China in particular drove the 
build- up of debt, with the debt ratio of the 
private non- fi  nancial sector rising from 
115% in 2008 to values in excess of 200% at the current end – here, too, driven prin-
cipally by non- fi  nancial corporations. Con-versely, the ratios of other large emerging economies, such as Brazil, Russia, India or South Africa, are currently signifi  cantly 
smaller – at less than 75% each – although 
Russia and Brazil have also experienced a substantial rise in debt from a low level 
since 2008.Debt ratios* of the private non-financial

is closely linked to the SAREB bad bank, which 
took on a substantial volume of non-  performing 
assets from Spanish banks, with significant 
haircuts on the nominal value, and liquidated 
them in a value-  pr eserving manner. It therefore 
contributed to a comprehensive balance sheet 
restructuring in the Spanish banking sector 
and, mirroring this, provided relief for the bal-
ance sheets of the private non-  financial sector .9 
In Portugal, Italy and Greece, by contrast, 
write-  downs played only a minor r ole. Here, 
developments were driven to a greater extent 
by active deleveraging.
Alternative indicators for 
 assessing the debt situation
In addition to the importance of current in -
come in the long term, debt sustainability can 
also be influenced by other factors in the short 
term. For example, the actual interest burden 
associated with servicing the debt can vary 
temporarily. This is especially the case when the 
interest payment obligations are variable and linked to a benchmark interest rate that, in 
turn, is influenced by monetary policy. One in -
dicator that takes this circumstance into ac -
count is the debt service ratio. This places the 
sum of the interest and redemption payments 
made in a single period in relation to aggregate 
income in the same period. Unlike the debt 
ratio, where a stock variable, ie indebtedness, 
is placed in relation to a flow variable, ie in -
come, in this case the numerator is therefore 
also a flow variable. The indicator thus meas -
ures the share of income that must be used to 
service debt, ie for interest and redemption 
payments. All other things being equal, a given 
debt level will be more sustainable and, in the 
short term, require fewer balance sheet adjust -
ments in the form of foregoing consumption or 
scaling back investment when the interest and 
repayment burden relative to income is low. 
For a given debt level, this can be the result of 
low interest rates – for example, owing to an 
expansionary monetary policy – or of a long 
borrowing term in which the redemption pay -ments in each period are correspondingly low. 
The chart on page  48 shows the change in 
debt service ratios between the second quarter of 2012 (when the deleveraging process began 
to intensify) and the current end of the data 
(second quarter of 2016). For the purposes of

cial and economic crisis) and mid-2012 is also 
shown.10
In the case of non-  financial corpor ations and 
households in Spain and Portugal, which were 
particularly highly indebted prior to the onset 
of the crisis, the debt service ratio had already 
started to fall in the wake of key interest rate 
cuts by the Eurosystem in the second half of 
2008, meaning that it decreased much sooner 
and to a considerably greater extent than the 
debt ratio. As the share of income needed for 
interest payments was subsequently lower, bal-
ance sheet constraints were eased in the pri -
vate non-  financial sector and, when viewed in 
isolation, the decline in consumption and in -
vestment via this channel was mitigated.11 This 
development may be partly due to the fact that 
loans subject to variable interest rates that move in line with a money market yield are 
more common in these two countries than in 
other euro-  ar ea countries.12 By contrast, the debt service ratios and debt ratios of the re -
maining countries under review here, in which 
loans are usually granted on a fixed-  r ate basis, 
followed a fairly similar pattern.13
While short-  term payment obligations ar e bet -
ter captured by the debt service ratio than the debt ratio, the former takes no account of the 
fact that debt can be reduced by selling exist -
ing assets to free up funds. Since liquidating 
the real assets of households (residential prop-
erties, in particular) and of non-  fi nancial cor -
porations (fixed assets, in particular) as well as 
certain components of long-  term financial  
assets in times of crisis is usually either difficult

10 The data are based on BIS calculations. See 
M Drehmann, A Illes, M Juselius and M Santos (2015), How much income is used for debt payments? A new database 
for debt service ratios, BIS Quarterly Review. The authors 
assume here that on the macroeconomic level, aggregate 
interest and amortisations are paid in approximately equal 
amounts in each period, similarly to an instalment loan. The debt service ratio (DSR) at time t is thus calculated 
using the following formula: DSRt = (it * Dt) / ((1 + (1  
+ it)-st) * Yt, where it corresponds to the average interest 
that has to be paid on the debt, Dt is the amount of debt, 
st is the average remaining maturity and Yt is gross dispos-
able income. As no time series are available for Greece, it is 
excluded from the analysis. Given the assumption for the 
debt service ratio that the remaining maturity of the debt is constant over time and across countries, all the differences 
between the debt service ratio and the debt ratio are at -
tributable to divergent developments in interest payments.
11 In addition to having a stabilising effect, this develop -
ment simultaneously creates incentives to only gradually 
address the actual issue of excessive indebtedness, which 
could, all in all, go as far as to render the economy more vulnerable to future shocks.12
 For information on interest rate characteristics for non-  
financial corporations, see Eurosystem Working Group (2013), Corporate finance and economic activity in the 
euro area, ECB Occasional Paper, No 151. For households, 
see ECB (2009), Housing finance in the euro area, Struc -
tural Issues Report, p 26.
13 Using the Bank’s econometric estimates, the extent to 
which interest rate changes prompted by monetary policy are passed through to the interest rate on the outstanding 
debt of households and non-  financial corporations was 
examined. In the context of the global financial crisis and 
the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, such an analysis 
comes with various caveats. For instance, the effects aris -
ing from possible changes in financing patterns or in the 
transmission mechanism can only be approximately esti -
mated at the current juncture. That said, the findings tend to suggest that monetary policy stimulus has, first and fore -
most, a greater and swifter impact on the debt servicing of 
households and non-  financial corporations in Portugal, 
Spain and – albeit to a lesser extent – Italy than those in 
Germany or France. With respect to possible changes in 
the interest rate pass-  t hrough, see Deutsche Bundesbank,

or entails heavy markdowns, making them un-
likely to be readily available to service debt, this 
article focuses solely on liquid financial assets. 
These are assets in the form of cash, deposits, 
shares, investment funds and debt securities 
that can be liquidated or sold without incurring 
significant costs.14 Debt and liquid financial   
assets therefore serve as two stock variables 
that can be compared in a ratio. A low ratio of 
debt to liquid financial assets means that, all 
other things being equal, the debt is set against sizeable assets that could be used to service the 
debt, irrespective of current income. The adja-
cent chart shows the change in this indicator 
for non-  financial corpor ations and households 
between mid-2012 and the current end of the 
data, with the overall change also broken 
down into the contributions made by debt and 
liquid assets.
With the exception of non-  fi nancial corpor -
ations in Greece, all countries and sectors 
under review have recorded a fall in the ratio of 
debt to liquid assets since mid-2012. In both 
sub- sectors of the private non-  financial sector  
in Spain and Portugal, as well as in the case of 
non- financial corpor ations in Italy, this develop -
ment was attributable to both active debt re -
duction and a rise in liquid assets. Debt reduc -
tion therefore goes hand in hand with a higher volume of assets that can be liquidated at short 
notice, which ought to increase resilience to 
any negative income and asset price shocks. 
There was a disproportionately sharp rise in 
liquid   assets in the case of the private non-  
 financial sectors in Germany and France, which 
led to the ratio dwindling despite an accumula -
tion of debt over the past few years.15 By con-
trast, liquid assets – particularly deposits – held 
by non-  financial corpor ations and households 
in Greece fell. Based on this development, it 
can be assumed that the private non-  financial  
sector has temporarily used its liquid assets 
here for debt-  servicing purposes. While this has 
reduced the debt burden, it has also lessened

14 Other, illiquid assets, such as claims against insurance 
corporations and pension funds or unlisted equity instru -
ments, can usually only be converted into cash at great 
expense and are therefore poorly suited to mobilisation at 
short notice. In qualitative terms, the results discussed in 
this article would be virtually identical if a narrow definition 
of liquid (current) assets limited to cash, deposits, short-  
term loans and debt securities were chosen.15 Looking at the level of, rather than change in, the ratio 
of debt to liquid assets, it differs significantly from the debt 
ratio with respect to relative positioning in the case of non-  
financial corporations in France. While, according to the latest data available, their debt ratio rose steadily to be -
come the highest debt ratio among the countries and sec -
tors under review, debt was at the second-  lowest level r ela-
tive to liquid assets and has remained more or less con -
stant, both over the longer term and in recent years. The 
high debt levels are thus accompanied by sizeable liquid 
financial assets.Deutsche Bundesbank

shocks.16 The table above summarises the 
change in the three indicators under review.
The ability to service debt is mirrored in credit -
ors’ balance sheets. Creditors are almost exclu -
sively from the domestic banking sector in the 
case of households and largely from said sector 
in the case of non-  financial corporations. The  
share of non-  performing loans as a percentage 
of banks’ total loans provides insight into whether borrowers are making their interest and redemption payments as contractually 
agreed. A high percentage of delinquent loans may be deemed indicative of an unsustainable level of indebtedness on the part of the private 
non- financial sector.
Particularly in Greece, but also in Italy and Por -
tugal, the high and rising share of non-  
performing loans as a percentage of total loans 
is a sign that, as a result of weak income 
growth, it remains difficult for many borrowers 
in the private non-  financial sector to service 
their debt. The Spanish banking system was 
likewise initially weighed down by a sharp rise 
in non-  performing loans in the wake of the cri -
sis. However, the volume of non-  performing 
loans has dropped discernibly since the transfer of legacy loan portfolios to a resolution agency at the turn of 2012-13 and the country’s signifi -
cant economic recovery.17 In Germany and France, non-  performing loans are at a moder -
ate and stable level and testify to the high credit quality of borrowers from the private 
non- financial sector.
The volume of non-  performing loans may also 
restrict banks’ credit supply. As loan impair -
ments are recognised in banks’ profit or loss, 
they have a negative impact on their earnings 
and hinder their efforts to build up capital in -
ternally. This, in turn, may increase their fund -
ing costs and limit their access to funding. These two factors did indeed deteriorate sig -
nificantly against the backdrop of strains on the 
European banking sector during the acute phase of the European debt crisis; together 
with the necessary balance sheet adjustments 
in the private non-  financial sector, they contrib -
uted to a sharp drop in loan dynamics, to 
which the Eurosystem responded with a series 
of non-  standard monetary policy measures.18Banks’ non-

Final assessment of the debt 
situation
In the following, debt reduction in the coun -
tries affected by the crisis is compared with 
several typical developments that have been 
observed in the past, with the aim of making it 
possible to assess changes in the private non-  
financial sector’s debt situation. To this end, 
the chart on page 52 shows the course of the 
debt ratio for the private non-  fin ancial sector 
as a whole before and after the GDP peak was 
reached at the end of 2008 for the countries 
under review here compared with two histor -
ical scenarios cited in the relevant literature: a 
typical business cycle and a typical private sec -
tor debt crisis. The classification of each busi -
ness cycle is based on a dataset of 15 industrial 
countries between 1960 and 2012: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. All in all, 40 typical business cycles and five debt crises (Spain in 1978, Nor -
way in 1987, Finland in 1991, Sweden in 1991 
and Japan in 1992) can be identified in the 
dataset.19 Private sector debt crises differ from 
typical business cycles in that they are preceded by a sharp rise in the debt ratio that, once the GDP peak has been reached, decreases just as clearly again in the medium term. Typical busi -
ness cycles are characterised by a weak but 
persistent upward movement of the debt ratio both before and after the GDP peak has been reached.
While the rise in the debt ratio for the private 
non- financial sector in Spain and Greece was 
considerably more dynamic than in comparable periods that culminated in a private sector debt 
crisis, developments in Italy and Portugal, on 
the other hand, were very similar to those aris -
ing during a typical debt crisis. With respect to 
the debt ratio’s period of decline, it is evident 
that, in Spain, this set in significantly more 
quickly than in previous private sector debt cri-ses and the decline was much more extensive. 
Even taking into account the somewhat stronger momentum during the debt build-  up 
phase, it can therefore be concluded that the 
deleveraging process in Spain already appears 
to be well underway. While the debt ratio ini -
tially fell with a considerable time lag in Portu -
gal, it has now reached a level that corresponds 
to developments in comparable historical 
periods. In each of these countries, this process is underpinned by a decline in the debt service 
ratio that is disproportionately large in com -
parison with the debt ratio. Resilience to nega-tive shocks has also risen recently as a result of 
holdings of liquid assets being expanded rela -
tive to debt levels. However, the comparatively 
rapid adjustment of lending rates to move in line with money market developments is also 
likely to make the non-  financial sectors of these 
countries more vulnerable to any normalisation of the monetary policy stance.
By contrast, the decline in the debt ratio for the 
private non-  financial sector in Italy, and particu -
larly in Greece, is lagging behind what would 
typically be expected. In Greece’s case, this is 
primarily on account of the sharp fall in eco -
nomic output in the wake of the Greek sover -
eign debt crisis. In Italy’s case, weak economic 
performance – which has been persisting for 
years now – is also hampering a more signifi -
cant fall in the debt ratio. To put matters into 
perspective, however, it may be concluded for 
both countries that, in a cross-  country com -
parison, their debt ratios are rather low, mean-
ing that the need for deleveraging could ac -
cordingly be lower than indicated by develop -
ments prior to the crisis. Strain is placed on 
non- financial corporations in Italy , however, 
due to the buffer of liquid assets being rather 
low, leaving them with only limited opportun -
ities to service their debt by selling assets in the 
event of adverse shocks. Households in Italy, Mapping devel-

on the other hand, find themselves in a rela -
tively comfortable position with respect to li -
quid assets. The private non-  financial sector in 
Greece has increasingly used liquid assets over 
the past few years to service its debt, thereby 
depleting existing reserves. That said, from a 
cross-  country perspective, the ratio of debt to  
liquid assets remains at a high level, particularly 
in the case of non-  financial corpor ations.
With respect to the private non-  financial sector 
in France, it may be concluded that the persist -
ent, but only moderate, increase in the debt 
ratio most closely represents developments during a typical business cycle and therefore marks a significant departure from the strong growth recorded in the countries affected by the crisis. While, according to the latest data 
available, non-  financial corporations in Fr ance 
have a relatively high debt ratio, this is put into perspective by the fact that the ratio of debt to liquid assets is very low compared with that of 
other countries. Germany is the only country under review here in which there was no phase 
of marked upward movement for the private 
non- financial sector’ s debt ratio during the ob -
servation period in the case of both non-  
financial corporations and households. This 
phase of debt reduction can, in part, be inter -
preted as a countermovement to the debt overhang of the 1990s. Growing profitability 
was another factor that helped non-  financial 
corporations, as it facilitated a shift towards in -
ternal financing.20 The course of the debt ratio 
over recent years and decades therefore attests to the fact that developments in Germany have 
diverged greatly from those in other euro-  area 
member states and can, at the same time, be 
taken as evidence of a now relatively stable 
debt situation.Developments

The hitherto sluggish pace of adjustment in 
some countries must, however, also be assessed 
against the backdrop of the economic situation 
in the euro area. Compared with the average 
course of a private sector debt crisis, develop -
ments in the euro area were also shaped, inter 
alia, by balance of payments problems, the lack 
of private capital flows, the fact that price com -
petitiveness can no longer be improved by mak-
ing nominal exchange rate adjustments, and 
strained public finances. It cannot be ruled out that the private and/or public sector would not 
have been capable of fully bearing the financial 
burden of broader stock-  flow adjustments, with  
the result that long-  lasting active debt r epay-
ments came to the fore.
Macroeconomic implications 
of debt reduction
Debt reduction is of relevance to economic pol -
icy makers in general and monetary policy 
makers in particular, above all because of the 
possible negative repercussions for the real 
economy. A particularly adverse scenario that 
can arise as a result of the deleveraging process 
is known as debt deflation.21 This occurs when 
the private non-  financial sector , finding itself in 
a state of overindebtedness, reduces its liabil -
ities. As a result of highly pronounced negative 
feedback loops in the real economy, however, 
this scenario gives rise to a disproportionately 
large reduction in real income and prices, 
which runs counter to debt reduction and cul -
minates in the debt ratio going up. Despite ac -
tively reducing debt, balance sheet constraints 
are tightened in such an extreme scenario.
The chart on page 54 shows that this adverse 
scenario has not occurred in any of the coun -
tries under review here.22 Debt deflation occurs 
when debt is reduced in a country but the debt 
ratio increases (upper left quadrant). The pri -
vate non-  financial sectors in Gr eece, Italy, Por -
tugal and Spain can be found in the lower left 
quadrant of the successful debt reduction scen -
ario. This is characterised by the fact that the active debt reduction was accompanied by a 
reduction in the debt ratio and, as a result, bal -
ance sheet constraints were removed. The debt 
ratio fell even in Greece despite a decline in its real GDP and price level. This implies that nom -
inal income fell in the wake of the deleveraging 
process, albeit to a lesser extent than the debt.
One reason for the comparatively weak impact 
of deleveraging on the (domestic) economic 
performance of these countries could be that 
the reduction in debt was reflected, at least in 
part, in a decline in imports, which is having a 
dampening effect on the decline in domestic 
demand.23 At the same time, the deleveraging 
process in the private non-  financial sector was 
reflected, at least in part, by an increase in pub-
lic debt resulting from the crisis-  r elated meas -
ures taken to stabilise the financial sector and 
to stimulate economic developments.24 How -
ever, it can be said for most of the countries hit 
by the European debt crisis that even the total

21 The idea of debt deflation dates back to the work of 
Irving Fisher. See I Fisher (1933), The debt-  deflation theory 
of great depressions, Econometrica 1, pp 337-357. The ap -
proach has been further developed by Hyman Minsky and 
Richard Koo, among others. See H  P  Minsky (1981), Debt 
deflation processes in today’s institutional environment, 
Hyman P Minsky Archive, Paper No 299, and R Koo (2009), 
The holy grail of macroeconomics – lessons from Japan’s 
great recession, Wiley, Singapore. A formalised version of 
these approaches can be found in G  B  Eggertsson and 
P Krugman (2012), Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity 
trap: a Fisher-  Minsky-  K oo approach, The Quarterly Journal 
of Economics 127(3), pp 1469-1513.22 The chart is based on a graph in European Commission, 
Private sector deleveraging: where do we stand?, Quarterly report on the euro area, Vol 13 (3), October 2014. The cal -
culations focus on changes in recent years because most of 
the active deleveraging only took place over this period. 
With the exception of Greece, the results are almost iden -
tical if the starting point for the review period is pushed 
further back into the past. The case of Greece shows that 
active deleveraging causes an increase in the debt ratio. 
However, the sharp decline in economic activity should not be attributed primarily to active deleveraging in the private 
non- financial sector but r ather to the Greek sovereign debt 
crisis.23
 Empirical studies show that changes in the private non-  
financial sector’s level of debt had a significant impact on the current accounts of the countries affected by the crisis. See R Unger (2017), Asymmetric credit growth and current 
account imbalances in the euro area, Journal of Inter -
national Money and Finance, forthcoming.

cluding the public sector  – have now fallen 
below their record highs, most of which were 
reached towards the end of 2014. This macro -
economic deleveraging was, in turn, reflected 
in lower net external liabilities, thus reducing 
dependence on cross-  bor der funding.
Despite active leveraging, the debt ratio de -
creased for the private non-  financial sector in  
Germany and across the euro area as a whole. 
This is because income rose more sharply in the 
wake of the credit expansion (lower right quad-
rant). In France, on the other hand, the active 
build-  up of debt ended in a slight incr ease in 
the debt ratio (upper right quadrant).
When comparing developments in the real economy with the course of the reference 
scenarios defined above, however, it becomes 
apparent that real GDP recovery was signifi -
cantly weaker in the countries most affected by 
the European debt crisis, namely in Italy, Spain 
and Portugal, and especially in Greece (see chart on page 55). By contrast, previous debt 
crises in the private sector were characterised 
by the fact that a strong economic recovery 
took hold around three years after reaching 
peak GDP .
Policy implications
Classification of the 
 deleveraging process
As the previous comments showed, the delev -
eraging process in the private non-  fi nancial 
sector has now picked up speed and in some 
cases it is at an advanced stage. While the de -
leveraging process has not ended in dangerous 
debt deflation in any of the countries under re -
view, economic recovery in the euro area as a 
whole and especially in the countries affected 
by the crisis has been relatively weak, however, 
by international standards.Developments

This development is likely due, among other 
things, to the high importance of active delev -
eraging. Historical experience shows that a 
phase of debt reduction goes faster if the ac -
tive debt reduction is accompanied by stock-  
flow adjustments.25 On the one hand, this is 
due to the fact that, when there are stock-  flow 
adjustments, debtors have to use a lower share 
of their income to service the debt. As a result, 
balance sheet constraints on debtors are eased 
and there is a correspondingly lower strain on 
aggregate demand. On the other hand, credit -
ors experience an immediate restructuring of 
their balance sheets. In principle, this will en -
courage lending and will thus prompt structural 
adjustments in the wake of a reallocation of 
resources within the economy.26
It should be noted, however, that stock-  fl ow 
adjustments in the private non-  financial sector 
are also passed on to their creditors’ balance 
sheets. Further financial turmoil may occur as a result of contagion effects, which could, for in -stance, make it necessary to take recapitalisa -
tion measures or to wind up ailing financial in -
stitutions. Moreover, moral hazard such as tak-
ing on excessive risk when granting loans or 
misuse of funds should be avoided to ensure 
that real resources are handled responsibly.
With the exception of Spain, stock-  flow adjust -
ments did not play a significant role in any of 
the countries heavily affected by the debt crisis. Developments in the euro area therefore stand 
in contrast to those in the United States, where Comparatively

Typical business cycles Debt crises in the private sector
25 A classic example of successful deleveraging is the Nor -
dic countries at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of 
the 1990s. After the debt-  financed house price bubbles  
burst, unsustainable debt in the private non-  financial sector 
was quickly written off and the banking systems were sub-
sequently recapitalised. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2014), 
op cit, pp 63-64 and the literature cited there.
26 Without stock-  flow adjustments, on the other hand,  
there is the danger that insolvent enterprises will be kept 
alive artificially, tying up real resources and preventing the emergence of new productive enterprises. See R Caballero, 
T Hoshi and A Kashyap (2008), Zombie lending and de -
pressed restructuring in Japan, American Economic Review, 98(5), pp 1943-1977.Deutsche Bundesbank

the debt level of households in particular fell 
following defaults on real estate loans.27 While 
this directly triggered losses for the banks, they 
were recapitalised early on and were therefore 
able to accommodate a renewed increase in demand for credit once the economy re -
covered.28
A reflection of the comparatively low import -
ance of stock-  flow adjustments in the eur o 
area is the continuing high stocks of non-  
performing loans on the balance sheets of 
most countries’ banks. While the comprehen -
sive assessment of the European Single Super -
visory Mechanism (SSM) provided greater clar -
ity regarding the volume of exposures in de -
fault, so far this has not led to a significant re -
duction in most countries. On the one hand, 
write-  downs on the stocks of non-  performing  
loans would accelerate the private non-  financial 
sector’s deleveraging process. On the other hand, the rehabilitation of banks’ balance 
sheets and the improved opportunities to find 
funding on the market would encourage lend -
ing and thereby enable the reallocation of re -
sources. In the event that individual credit insti -
tutions might be unable to meet the regulatory 
capital requirements as a result of these write-  
downs, the “bail-  i n” provisions in force since 
1 January 2016 facilitate the institutions’ proper recovery or resolution while minimising the im-
pact on the real economy and public finances.
29
The importance of effective 
 insolvency frameworks
The manner in which insolvent debtors and the 
associated reduction of debt are handled de -
pends on how the insolvency framework is 
structured, including, in particular, the condi -
tions under which insolvency proceedings are 
initiated, the rights and obligations of the lend -
ers and borrowers and the role of jurisdiction.30 
The costs and time frame of the proceedings 
are also relevant in this context. Insolvency pro -
ceedings primarily regulate how recoverable 
receivables are repaid and unrecoverable debts are settled. Unlike solutions that are negotiated 
ad hoc,  insolvency proceedings ensure lower 
friction losses and promote the efficient alloca -
tion of resources from a macroeconomic per -
spective. In the case of enterprises, insolvency 
proceedings generally aim to maintain as far as 
possible the value of the productive part of a 
business and, if need be, to liquidate it in a manner that preserves its value. For personal 
insolvency, the realisation of collateral such as 
real estate is standard practice and is sup -
ported, if necessary, by debt renegotiations or 
restructuring.
Structuring an insolvency framework appropri -
ately is very complex because many factors and 
influences play a role. For example, the pres -
ence of an insolvency framework already af -
fects the willingness of the private sector to 
borrow and lend even before any insolvency 
proceedings are initiated. Comprehensive cred -
itor protection may also help best protect the 
interests of creditors in the event of a borrow -
er’s insolvency. Nevertheless, it should not go 
so far as to encourage creditors to take on ex -
cessive risk. At the same time, clear liability 
principles for borrowers mean that investment 
risks are sufficiently taken into account, thereby 
avoiding the risk of the funds provided being 
misused (moral hazard). Borrowers should not, Minor import -

were held by investors worldwide, a significant proportion 
of the losses due to write-  offs was able to be “exported ” 
abroad, thereby reducing the US banking system’s need to 
be recapitalised. By contrast, exposures to the private non-  
financial sector in the euro-  ar ea countries worst affected 
by the crisis were primarily held by their domestic banking 
sectors, which in turn obtained funding from banks in European core countries. This led to a concentration of 
losses at the national level which, when viewed in isolation, 
made balance sheet restructuring more difficult in the 
banking sector.

and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a frame -

however, be barred from profitable investment 
projects from the outset. In addition to these 
effects, which could arise even before insolv -
ency occurs, insolvency frameworks that avoid 
placing an excessive and prolonged burden on borrowers may also give them the incentive to 
continue their business activities even after in -
solvency. All in all, suitable insolvency frame -
works can thus help bring unproductive activ -
ities to an end and redirect the resources that 
are freed up to an efficient use.
Individual countries in the euro area display a 
high degree of heterogeneity in the structure 
of their existing insolvency frameworks. For ex -
ample, Germany’s insolvency framework is 
characterised by a comparatively varied set of 
measures, for both businesses and households. In France, the insolvency framework aims espe -
cially at maintaining business activities and re -
taining jobs. However, the situation in coun -
tries heavily affected by the crisis is rather dif -
ferent. For example, most insolvent companies 
in Spain are traditionally wound up. Recently, however, restructuring programmes and per -
sonal insolvency have been made increasingly 
easier. While Greece has relatively well-  
developed insolvency legislation, which has 
been reformed several times since 2010, the 
structural nature of the debt and the compara -
tively lengthy processes involved in institutional 
implementation mean that the reduction of 
non- performing business loans has so far been 
sluggish. Similarly, non-  performing loans r ose 
sharply in Italy in the wake of the crisis, prompt -
ing the initiation of previously lacking legal and 
institutional reforms to increase the effective -
ness of the insolvency framework.
This heterogeneity in insolvency frameworks 
can also be seen in the data from the World 
Bank’s Doing Business report, which includes an indicator of the general quality of various 
countries’ insolvency frameworks.31 According 
to this comprehensive indicator, Germany and 
Portugal have especially effective insolvency 
frameworks compared to the rest of the euro 
area, while Spain and France are just above average. While the indicator for France has 
greatly improved in recent years, the value for 
Greece remains at a very low level. Italy’s in -
solvency framework stands out due to the fact 
that the costs of settling non-  performing loans 
are very high by global standards. The related 
reforms, which have been initiated multiple 
times since 2012, could soon make any neces -
sary stock-  flow adjustments in this regard eas -
ier – provided these reforms target inadequate provisions and increase confidence in the legal 
framework – and thus contribute to a quicker 
reduction in non-  performing loans.
In this context, however, it should generally be 
noted that changes to insolvency frameworks 
do represent an encroachment on existing 
debtor-  cr editor relationships. These should be 
carried out carefully so as not to damage trust 
in the underlying conditions and to avoid caus -
ing ultimately avoidable risk premiums with 
their corresponding feedback effects on macro -
economic demand.
Conclusion
On the whole, it can be said that noticeable progress has been achieved in recent years 
with regard to the deleveraging process in the 
private non-  financial sector in countries espe -
cially hit by the crisis. Compared to historical 
reference periods, the reduction of debt has 
been heavily driven by debt repayment – stock-  
flow adjustments played only a minor role in most countries. Only in Spain were the com -
paratively extensive write-  downs accompanied 
by government takeovers and the value-  
preserving resolution of commercial banks’ dis-
tressed assets, contributing to balance sheet 
restructuring in the private financial and non-  Insolvency

ditions regarding the business activities of small and 
medium-  s ized enterprises in 190 countries. Sources of in -
formation especially include relevant legislation, World Bank surveys, the respective government authorities and World Bank employees. See World Bank, Doing Business

financial sector. The lesser importance of stock-  
flow adjustments in the remaining countries is 
likely to have contributed to the sluggishness 
of the economic recovery, however.
It is expected that the adjustment processes in 
the private sector’s sectoral balance sheets will 
continue. In this context, stock-  fl ow adjust -
ments addressing the stocks of non-  performing 
loans, which are still high in some cases, in the banking systems concerned could provide con -
siderable support to the deleveraging process. 
However, it must be ensured that the macro -
economic burden of stock-  flow adjustments  
can be borne in principle. To take into account 
liability principles, funding should be provided 
by the private sector as far as possible. Reform 
measures regarding insolvency frameworks and 
consolidation efforts in euro-  ar ea countries 
should especially be considered in this context.Deutsche Bundesbank
