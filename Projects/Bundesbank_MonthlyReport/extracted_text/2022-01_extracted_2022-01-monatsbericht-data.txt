Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German real gross domestic product (GDP) is 
likely to have dropped somewhat in the final 
quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to the re -
surgence of the pandemic. The resultant 
changes in behaviour and containment meas -
ures put a significant strain on economic activ -
ity in parts of the services sector, particularly in 
December. According to surveys by the ifo In -
stitute, enterprises’ assessment of the current 
situation deteriorated considerably in the retail 
sector and the accommodation and food ser -
vices sector. On an average of October and No -
vember, however, retail sales were up slightly 
on the third quarter after price adjustment and 
the drop in sales in accommodation and food 
services was relatively moderate only. By con -
trast, industry and construction probably gen -
erated positive stimuli in the fourth quarter. 
Surveys by the ifo Institute show that bottle -
necks in the supply of intermediate goods con -
tinued to delay production considerably. The 
share of enterprises in the manufacturing sec -
tor reporting production delays due to supply 
bottlenecks even reached a new peak in 
Decem ber.1 According to data available up to 
Novem ber, industrial output nevertheless rose 
somewhat. In particular, the automotive sector 
– an important contributor – recorded substan -
tial growth from the previous sharply depressed 
level. The construction sector also saw dis -
tinctly more output than in the third quarter.
According to provisional calculations by the 
Federal Statistical Office, real GDP rose by 2.7% 
on the year in 2021 as a whole (and also by 
2.7% after calendar adjustment). This was far 
from enough to offset the steep drop in eco -
nomic output of 4½% in 2020. Pandemic-  
related setbacks and supply- side bottlenecks 
dampened the recovery last year. On the out -
put side, gross value added in the manufactur -ing sector increased substantially, but still fell 
well short of the pre- crisis 2019 level. The ser -
vices sector also stepped up its gross value 
added significantly. However, in sectors espe -
cially affected by the pandemic, such as ac -
commodation and food services and the arts, 
entertainment and recreation sector, it re -
mained far below the pre- crisis level. Real gross 
value added fell slightly in the construction sec -
tor, which had remained largely unaffected by 
the pandemic in 2020. Anticipatory effects on 
account of the lower VAT rates in the second 
half of 2020 also played a role here. On the ex -
penditure side, growth was boosted mainly by 
government consumption, investment in ma -
chinery and equipment, and exports. By con -
trast, private consumption continued to suffer 
from the effects of the pandemic and merely 
stagnated on an annual average.
Industry
Industrial output saw a marginal increase in 
November 2021 after seasonal adjustment,2 
exceeding the previous month’s level by ¼%. 
On an average of October and November, it 
was up slightly on the third quarter (+¾%). 
However, production of intermediate goods 
and of consumer goods fell slightly (-1¼% and 
-½%). Production of capital goods saw a steep 
rise, on the other hand (+3¼%). This was 
mainly thanks to considerable growth in the 
automotive sector and in the manufacture of 
other transport equipment.3 By contrast, there 
was a marked drop in the manufacture of ma -
chinery and equipment and of computer, elec -German

tronic and optical products. Overall, industrial 
output was still considerably lower than the 
pre- crisis level from the fourth quarter of 2019 
(-5½%) owing to the ongoing bottlenecks in 
the supply of intermediate goods.
Industrial orders rose steeply in November 
2021, increasing by a seasonally adjusted 3¾% 
on the month. On an average of October and 
November, however, they contracted sharply 
compared with the third quarter (-6%). Exclud -
ing large orders, the decline was much smaller 
though (-1½%). Orders for capital goods fell 
particularly strongly (-9%). This was partly due 
to a substantial decrease in orders for the 
manufacture of other transport equipment, 
which is often influenced by large orders. On 
the other hand, the automotive sector received 
slightly more orders than in the third quarter. 
Manufacturers of intermediate goods received 
markedly fewer new orders (-2½%). In contrast 
to this, demand for consumer goods picked up 
distinctly (+2%). Broken down by region, do -
mestic orders and, in particular, orders from 
non- euro area countries saw a steep drop, 
whereas orders from the euro area rose some -
what. Despite this decrease, demand for Ger -
man industrial products remained high, espe -
cially compared with the depressed level of in -
dustrial output. This demand exceeded the pre- 
crisis level from the fourth quarter of 2019 by 
6¾%.
Nominal industrial sales, unlike industrial out -
put, rose steeply in November 2021, with a 
seasonally adjusted increase of 4¾% on the 
previous month. On an average of October and 
November, too, they picked up strongly from 
the third quarter (+5%). The increase was 
broadly based across regions, but was strong -
est for non- euro area countries. Broken down 
by sector, sales of intermediate goods and of 
capital goods were up steeply. Unit sales of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts in -
creased considerably, in particular. By contrast, 
sales of consumer goods rose only slightly. A 
sharp drop in sales of pharmaceutical products 
had an impact here. In November, nominal Industrial orders

goods exports rose distinctly on the month 
(+1¾%) after adjustment for seasonal vari -
ations. In October and November combined, 
they increased steeply on the summer months 
(+4¼%) in line with the growth in sales. In real 
terms, they surpassed the third- quarter level by 
a distinct margin (+1½%), owing to a signifi -
cant increase in exports of goods to non- euro 
area countries. Real exports to euro area coun -
tries stagnated, however.  November saw a 
steep rise in nominal goods imports. They were 
up 3¼% on the month and, on an average of 
October and November, were even 8% higher 
than in the third quarter. By contrast, price-  
adjusted imports exceeded the third- quarter 
level only a little (+1%), because import prices 
for energy were considerably higher.
Construction
After adjustment for seasonal variations, out -
put in the construction sector decreased some -
what in November 2021 when compared with 
the previous month (-¾%). On an average of 
October and November, though, it was up 
markedly on the third quarter (+1%). This was 
largely due to a significant increase in output in 
the main construction sector. In the finishing 
trades, by contrast, output was marginally 
lower. The order situation in the main construc -
tion sector is still good. Although order intake 
fell slightly in October – the latest month for 
which data are available – from the third- quar-
ter level, the reach of the order books in De -
cember remained at the previously achieved 
peak, according to ifo Institute surveys. Utilisa -
tion of equipment and machinery increased 
further and thus remained well above its multi- 
year average.
Labour market
On the labour market, the relatively favourable 
developments in employment and unemploy -
ment were continuing until recently, despite 
the increase in the infection rate. Employment rose by 43,000 persons in November 2021 
after seasonal adjustment. Employment growth 
was especially positive for jobs subject to social 
security contributions. In October, these in -
creased just as strongly as overall employment. 
New staff were recruited mainly in business-  
related services, information and communica -
tion services, and in accommodation and food 
service activities. No recovery is discernible in 
manufacturing as yet. The number of short-  
time workers saw another distinct drop to 
710,000 persons in October, according to an 
initial estimate by the Federal Employment 
Agency. However, leading indicators are signal -
ling a temporarily weaker increase in employ -
ment. The employment barometers of the ifo 
Institute and the Institute for Employment Re -
search (IAB) recently fell significantly. The num -
ber of persons named in notifications of cyclical 
short- time work doubled in December as con -
tainment measures intensified compared with 
the previous month. As against the situation 
one year earlier, however, there are still far 
fewer notifications. At the same time, the 
growing number of vacancies and frequent re -
ports of labour shortages are pointing to a fun -
damentally strong level of labour demand in 
Germany.
Registered unemployment was down by 
23,000 persons in December after adjustment 
for seasonal variations. The decline was thus 
somewhat slower than in previous months. The 
unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage point 
to 5.2%. Over the past few months, there was 
mainly a drop in unemployment covered by the 
statutory insurance scheme, which is influ -
enced by cyclical factors. It is now already 
markedly below the level of the first quarter of 
2020, when the figures were not yet affected 
by the pandemic. By contrast, the number of 
unemployed persons covered by the basic 
welfare  allowance is still well above the pre-  
pandemic level owing to the higher proportion 
of long- term unemployed. The IAB’s unemploy -
ment barometer fell further in December, 
putting  it back in slightly negative territory for 
the first time since August 2020. Unemploy -Construction

ment could go up marginally over the coming 
months.
Prices
Crude oil prices recently picked up markedly, 
after having fallen distinctly in November and 
December owing to concerns about demand 
surrounding the emergence of the Omicron 
variant. Prices were driven up by the surpris -
ingly robust global demand for crude oil and by 
supply shortages in a number of oil- producing 
countries. As this report went to press, the 
price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at 
US$88, the highest price for the past seven 
years. This represented a year- on- year increase 
of around 50%. Crude oil futures were trading 
at marked discounts, however. The discount on 
crude oil futures was US$4 for deliveries six 
months ahead and US$8 for deliveries 12 
months ahead. Unlike crude oil prices, market 
prices for natural gas have retreated somewhat 
since the end of last year. However, they were 
still many times higher than their prior- year 
level as this report went to press.
Import prices continued to rise markedly in No -
vember. The increase in the prices of energy 
products was not as exceptionally steep as in 
October, but was still unusually high. Price 
pressures for other goods remained just as pro -
nounced as in previous months. At the indus -
trial producer level, for which December data 
are already available, price pressures picked up 
more strongly again on account of energy. In 
addition, the prices of non- energy goods were 
again raised substantially. Overall, the annual 
growth rate recently came to just under 25% 
for both imports and industrial products. Ex -
cluding energy, the increase amounted to 
around 10% in each case.
The inflation rate remained at a very high level. 
Compared with the previous month, however, 
consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose only 
a little in December after adjustment for sea -sonal variations. In the months prior, they had 
risen very steeply. Energy prices decreased 
markedly for the first time in some months on 
the back of falling crude oil prices. The previous 
steep rise in prices for services also weakened 
somewhat. Food prices, by contrast, picked up 
fairly significantly, and price pressures for non- 
energy industrial goods, excluding clothing, re -
mained high. Annual headline HICP inflation re -
ceded from 6.0% to 5.7%. This was mainly be -
cause of the elimination of a statistical effect 
which had pushed the rate up by just over 
¼  percentage point in the previous month. 
This effect was due to the coronavirus pan -
demic having led to fairly major adjustments to 
some HICP weights, particularly for package 
holidays, for 2021 in line with consumption 
habits of the previous year.4 This also caused 
the rate excluding energy and food to drop 
from 4.1% to 3.9%. This one- off effect had no 
impact on the national consumer price index 
(CPI), however. At 5.3%, its rate was similar to 
what it had been in November. The relatively 
large difference between this and the HICP is 
because the higher inflation in goods prices 
compared with services has a greater impact 
on the HICP . Goods account for a higher share 
in the HICP than in the CPI, mainly because the 
HICP so far has not included the costs of 
owner- occupied housing, which is counted to -
wards services.5
On an annual average, HICP inflation rose 
steeply from 0.4% in 2020 to 3.2% in 2021.6 
This was only partly attributable to one- off ef -
fects such as the introduction of the climate 
package, the rebound in crude oil prices and 
the roll- back of the temporary VAT cut.7 More -
over, the prices of services and non- energy in -Marked rise in

5 In the CPI for Germany, owner- occupied housing is cap -
tured applying the rental equivalence approach and with a 
weight of around 10%. One of the key outcomes of the 
monetary policy strategy review completed in the summer 
of 2021 is, however, the Eurosystem’s wish for owner-  
occupied housing to also be included in the HICP in future, 
using the net acquisition approach. See also European Cen -
tral Bank (2021).

dustrial goods increased exceptionally steeply 
at various times during the year, primarily on 
account of delivery bottlenecks and price hikes 
intended to compensate for previously lost 
profits. As these factors are continuing into the 
new year, HICP inflation is likely to remain ex -
ceptionally high at the start of 2022, despite 
the elapsing of the aforementioned one- off 
effects . On top of this, the considerably higher 
market prices for natural gas will mean a com -
mensurate hike in consumer rates.
Public finances
Local government finances
Local government core budgets and off- budget 
entities ended the third quarter of 2021 close 
to balance. At the same time last year, they had 
posted a high deficit of €4½ billion. Revenue 
rose strongly, by 11% (+€7 billion), of which 
more than half was attributable to tax receipts. 
Net receipts from local business tax saw par -
ticularly steep growth (+38%, or +€3 billion). 
Local government tax receipts were therefore 
also higher than they had been prior to the 
coronavirus crisis, exceeding Q3 2019 revenue 
by almost €2 billion (+7%). Meanwhile, re -
ceipts from local business tax, a large revenue 
item, were almost one- quarter higher. In the 
first half of the year, revenue was still slightly 
below its pre- crisis level of 2019. Transfers from 
state government, too, rose substantially on 
the year (+10%, or just under +€3 billion). This 
was due, above all, to a one- off effect: in 2020, 
extensive general purpose grants were brought 
forward into the second quarter in North 
Rhine-  Westphalia.
Expenditure rose significantly overall, by 4% 
(+€3 billion). Personnel costs, a major item, 
saw above- average growth of 5%, and growth 
in other operating expenditure was even more 
dynamic (+7%). By contrast, spending on social 
benefits increased much more slowly, by 2%, 
whilst accommodation costs for those receiv -
ing unemployment benefit II decreased slightly. As in the first half of the year, fixed asset for -
mation contracted (-2½%, or just under -€½ 
billion). Construction investment, in particular, 
experienced a decline.
In the first three quarters of 2021 combined, 
local government budgets recorded a deficit of 
€6 billion, €8 billion down on the year. A clear 
surplus can be expected for the fourth quarter 
of 2021, as is usual for the time of year.8 All in 
all, therefore, local governments could have 
closed 2021 with a more or less balanced 
budget. They are thus likely to have withstood 
the second pandemic year well overall. In fact,

8 The very high surplus in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 
attributable to two one- off effects: in 2020, central and 
state government compensated local government for an -
ticipated crisis-  induced shortfalls in local business tax rev -
enue. In addition, central government permanently in -
creased its contribution to the accommodation costs for re -
cipients of unemployment benefit II. The respective annual 
amounts payable to local government stood at €11 billion 
and €3 billion, and were received in full in the fourth quar -
ter.Deutsche Bundesbank

may even have largely approached the levels 
expected prior to the crisis.
The outlook for the current year is not un -
favourable either, despite uncertainty surround -
ing the further course of the pandemic and 
macroeconomic developments. Further action 
is needed to expand local government infra -
structure. Construction bottlenecks could con -
tinue to present an obstacle, yet it would be 
helpful if the approval process were acceler -
ated in good time, as intended by the new Fed -
eral Government.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2021, issuance in the German 
bond market stood at €135.0 billion in gross 
terms (previous month: €134.9 billion). After 
deducting redemptions, which were signifi -cantly lower than in the previous month, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own debt securities, the outstanding 
volume of domestic bonds grew by €33.3 bil -
lion. The outstanding volume of foreign debt 
securities in Germany also rose by €8.2 billion. 
The funds raised from sales of domestic and 
foreign debt securities in the German market 
therefore amounted to €41.4 billion.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €20.6 
billion net in the reporting month. On balance, 
this was chiefly attributable to central govern -
ment (€19.2 billion), which mainly issued two- 
year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze: €5.3 bil -
lion), five- year Federal notes (Bobls: €4.8 bil -
lion), as well as Treasury discount paper (Bu -
bills: €4.1 billion) and ten- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds: €4.1 billion). State and local govern -
ment issued bonds worth €1.4 billion net.
Domestic enterprises augmented their capital 
market debt by €8.3 billion net in the reporting 
month, following net redemptions of €7.5 bil -
lion in the previous month. Non- financial cor -
porations were the chief issuers of new bonds, 
on balance, but other financial intermediaries 
were also active in the market. The majority of 
the bonds issued had maturities of more than 
one year.
The outstanding volume of debt securities 
issued  by domestic credit institutions grew by 
€4.3 billion in November, following an increase 
of €7.4 billion in the preceding month. On bal -
ance, issuance was almost exclusively confined 
to debt securities issued by specialised credit 
institu  tions (€7.0 billion), while mortgage 
Pfandbriefe saw net redemptions of €3.4 bil -
lion.
Among the various investor groups, the Bun -
desbank was the main buyer in November on 
balance. It acquired debt securities amounting 
to €23.4 billion net, predominantly under the 
Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes. Do -
mestic non- banks and foreign investors in -

€0.5 billion in net terms; these were exclusively 
foreign securities on balance.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €2.4 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market (October: €5.5 billion). 
The outstanding volume of foreign shares in 
the German market rose by €4.1 billion over 
the same period. Domestic non- banks and do -

Germany (€9.2 billion).
Mutual funds
In November 2021, domestic mutual funds sold 
shares totalling €13.2 billion net in the market 
(previous month: €20.2 billion). In net terms, 
fresh funds were injected chiefly into special -
ised funds reserved for institutional investors 
(€9.4 billion). Among the various asset classes, 
mixed securities funds in particular recorded in -
flows (€5.4 billion), as did equity funds (€3.5 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€2.1 
billion). Foreign mutual funds placed shares 
worth €15.8 billion in the German market in 
the reporting month. On balance, domestic 
non- banks were virtually the sole purchasers, 
adding a net €28.2 billion worth of mutual 
fund shares to their portfolios. Domestic credit 
institutions acquired mutual fund shares for 
€1.7 billion net, while foreign investors sold do -

in the goods account declined slightly, but the 
surplus in invisible current transactions, which 
comprise services as well as primary and sec -
ondary income, increased more strongly.
In November, the surplus in the goods account 
fell by €0.3 billion on the month to €13.6 bil -
lion because imports of goods recorded a 
sharper increase than exports.
The surplus in invisible current transactions 
grew in November by €1.6 billion to €5.3 bil -
lion. The main reason for this was the shift in 
the services account from a deficit to a surplus 
of €1.6 billion, with lower travel expenditure 
playing a role in particular. By contrast, the def -
icit in the secondary income account rose 
slightly by €0.5 billion to €6.1 billion; this was 
primarily attributable to higher general govern -
ment expenditure on current transfers relating 
to international cooperation. Furthermore, net 
receipts in the primary income account re -
mained broadly unchanged at €9.8 billion.
In November 2021, concerns about rising infla -
tion rates and a tightening of monetary policy 
in the major economies continued to influence 
the international financial markets. It was 
against this backdrop that Germany’s cross-  
border portfolio investment recorded net cap -
ital exports of €31.9 billion (after €28.0 billion 
in October). Domestic investors added, on bal -
ance, €27.4 billion worth of securities issued by 
non- residents to their portfolios, purchasing 
mutual fund shares (€15.8 billion), bonds (€11.1 
billion) and shares (€3.4 billion), but offloading 
money market paper (€2.9 billion). Foreign in -
vestors disposed of German securities to the 
tune of €4.6 billion net, selling shares (€9.2 bil -
lion), bonds (€6.8 billion) and mutual fund 
shares (€1.0 billion), while purchasing money 
market paper (€12.5 billion).In November, the balance of financial deriva -
tives recorded net outflows (€11.4 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €25.7 billion in the reporting month (Octo -
ber: net capital imports of €5.7 billion). Overall, 
domestic enterprises increased their foreign dir -
ect investment by €39.9 billion, with outflows 
of funds totalling €31.9 billion through the 
intra- group credit channel. Moreover, domestic 
firms increased their equity capital in foreign 
enterprises by €8.0 billion, almost half of which 
took the form of reinvested earnings. Non-  
resident enterprises injected their affiliated 
enter prises in Germany with direct investment 
funds worth €14.2 billion net. They issued intra-  
group loans (€12.7 billion) and boosted their 
equity capital slightly (€1.6 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
inflows of capital amounting to €19.5 billion in 
November (following €19.2 billion in October). 
Monetary financial institutions (excluding the 
Bundesbank) recorded net capital imports 
(€27.3 billion). Transactions by enterprises and 
households (€10.5 billion) and by general gov -
ernment (€4.3 billion) also led to net inflows of 
funds from abroad. By contrast, the Bundes -
bank recorded a rise of €22.6 billion in its net 
claims. TARGET2 claims on the ECB increased 
even more strongly (by €60.9 billion). However, 
non- resident counterparty deposits at the Bun -
desbank expanded as well.

Changes in the secured money market
Aggregate secured euro money market rates have repeatedly been below the Eurosystem’s 
deposit facility rate in recent years. Key reasons for this are the increasing use of non- standard 
monetary policy measures and various alternative investment options for market participants. In 
the area of monetary policy, the Eurosystem’s asset purchases and the high level of excess liquid -
ity play particular roles. However, against this backdrop, another important factor is the increas -
ing concentration of money market activity in transactions between market participants that have 
access to accounts at the central bank and those that do not.
Aggregate secured money market rates such as the German RepoFunds Rate and the STOXX GC 
Pooling EUR ON index have been persistently below the deposit facility rate since 2015 in particu -
lar, whereas, prior to that time, such occurrences had only been observable for shorter periods. 
As aggregate money market rates encompass transactions that vary in terms of the type and 
reusability of the collateral used or the composition of the market participants, they are also 
affected to differing degrees by the impact of non- standard monetary policy measures. There are 
therefore some considerable differences in the spreads between the various money market rates 
and the deposit facility rate.
When viewed in isolation, monetary policy asset purchase programmes reduce the supply of cer -
tain collateral in the money market. As a result, the interest rates of corresponding repo transac -
tions may decline. This effect primarily impacts repo transactions that are conducted for the pur -
pose of borrowing specific securities and having these at one’s disposal for the term of the trans -
action. High excess liquidity, by contrast, has a particular impact on secured money market trans -
actions that are conducted for liquidity management purposes, as banks have fewer incentives to 
redistribute liquidity among themselves. As a result, the relative share of transactions between 
market participants that have access to the central bank’s balance sheet and those that do not 
rises, and thus so too does the significance of transactions for which the deposit facility does not 
represent a lower bound.
As stipulated in the European treaties, the Eurosystem acts in accordance with the principles of a 
market economy. Therefore, in addition to managing the general interest rate level, it is not fun -
damentally the task of the Eurosystem to also purposefully influence price formation in individual 
financial market segments. If interest rate spreads widen in the financial markets, this is desirable 
in principle and an expression of functioning markets.
However, in the event that interest rates for secured money market transactions are very low on 
account of the scarcity of collateral, the Eurosystem strives to counteract the monetary policy 
asset purchase programmes’ undesirable consequences for the repo market. To this end, it allows 
market participants to borrow certain bonds through securities lending arrangements. The Euro -
system’s securities lending is not, however, intended to be a tool for managing interest rate con -
ditions in the secured money market, but merely to serve as a backstop to mitigate the scarcity 
of collateral in the repo market caused by the asset purchases.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In the secured money market, market par -
ticipants trade funds in the form of credit bal -
ances, in exchange for which the lender re -
ceives collateral from the borrower. The collat -
eral is provided in the form of securities, mean -
ing that securities are temporarily exchanged 
for account balances in secured money market 
transactions. The contracting parties agree a 
rate of interest for the transfer of account bal -
ances, and this has typically been negative in 
recent years. One motive for conducting such a 
transaction may be to temporarily increase 
one’s own stock of liquid assets in the form of 
account balances. Conversely, a transaction 
may also be conducted to obtain certain secur -
ities on a temporary basis. The secured money 
market can therefore be used both for liquidity 
management and collateral management.
Alongside banks, participants in the secured 
money market also include financial corpor -
ations and, to a lesser extent, non- financial cor -
porations and public sector institutions. Motives 
for conducting secured money market transac -
tions may vary depending on the type of market 
participant. Non- financial corporations and 
public sector institutions use the market primar -
ily for liquidity management purposes and the 
secure investment of liquid assets. In addition, 
financial corporations frequently conduct 
securities- related transactions, for example if 
they are in the securities trading business. This 
makes it possible for specifically required secur -
ities, for example, to be borrowed. Investors 
such as pension funds or insurers that hold 
long- term securities portfolios can earn add -
itional revenue by lending securities. At banks, 
all of the aforementioned motives can manifest 
themselves in individual combinations, depend -
ing on the business model. However, some 
banks additionally act as intermediaries, con -
ducting their own asset and liability business in 
the secured money market.1
Since 2016, the Eurosystem’s money market 
statistics have recorded the money market transactions of the 47 euro area banks that had 
the largest main balance sheet assets (total 
assets minus other assets) as at 31 December 
2014.2 In the context of money market statis -
tics, the Bundesbank additionally records the 
transactions of a further 97 German institutions 
at present. Overall, the money market statistics 
for December 2020 show an outstanding vol -
ume of euro- denominated secured money 
market transactions of €1.8 trillion.3 A concep -
tually comparable figure is provided by the 
International Capital Market Association 
(ICMA), which puts the euro- denominated out -
standing volume at €4.5 trillion on the basis of 
a survey of 60 participating European institu -
tions.4 The difference to the money market 
statistics can likely be explained in part by the 
fact that the ICMA figures include money mar -
ket actors in the United Kingdom as well as the 
largest clearing houses.5 Data on the size and 
trading volumes of the secured money market 
usually vary considerably, as the measurement 
concepts differ with regard to the currency and 
type of collateral covered, as well as the domi -
cile and the sectoral affiliation of the market 
participants.Temporary

2 The legal basis for the collection of data is provided by 
Regulation (EU) No 1333/ 2014 (ECB/ 2014/ 48) concerning 
statistics on the money markets as amended by Regulation 
(EU) No 1599/ 2015. The sample originally comprised 53 
banks. Due to mergers, this figure has since fallen to 47. A 
monetary financial institution (MFI) is required to report 
data on money market transactions if its total main balance 
sheet assets as at 31 December 2014 exceeded 0.35% of 
the total main balance sheet assets of all euro area MFIs.

sult, it is possible that transactions are counted multiple 
times. Also includes the larger German sample of money 
market statistics. Excluded are intra- group transactions, 
securities lending without cash collateral, and collateral 
swaps and transactions with terms exceeding 397 days. 
Multiple counting of “open repos” (i.e. secured money 
market transactions that are automatically extended until 
one counterparty ends the transaction) is treated as in 
Tischer (2021).

Prior to the introduction of money market stat -
istics, the ESCB gathered data from European 
banks through the Euro Money Market Survey.6 
The data collected by this survey included quar -
terly trading volumes of secured and unsecured 
money market transactions in interbank trad -
ing. According to the survey results, turnover 
increased by 25% in the secured money market 
from 2008 to 2015, but fell by as much as 80% 
in the unsecured money market, which had be -
come markedly less attractive for banks to use 
as a result of regulatory measures (Basel III) and 
changes in money market management.7 In 
the money market statistics data, which also 
encompass banks’ money market transactions 
with financial corporations, general govern -
ment and large non- financial corporations, this 
trend continued between 2016 and 2021. 
While turnover in the secured segment in -
creased by roughly 63%, turnover in the un -
secured segment declined by about 4%. For 
interbank trading, these respective develop -
ments were markedly more pronounced still.
The secured money market encompasses vari -
ous instruments, of which the repo transaction 
(or repo for short) is the most important.8 A 
repo consists of two transactions in which 
funds are exchanged for collateral. At the start 
of the transaction, the lender transfers the loan 
amount to the borrower and receives a security 
from the borrower as collateral. Haircuts may 
be applied, which means that the amount of 
funds may be lower than the value of the col -
lateral. This provides the lender with some pro -
tection from possible fluctuations in the value 
of the collateral. In addition, the counterparties 
may agree an obligation to make additional 
payments in case the value of the collateral de -
clines during the term of the repo transaction. 
Otherwise, the lender could incur losses if the 
borrower were to default and the recovered 
amounts from the collateral were insufficient to 
cover the credit losses. At the end of the term, 
the funds and the collateral are exchanged 
back. The borrower additionally pays interest 
on the borrowed funds.Depending on the agreed collateral, there are 
two types of repo transaction. In general collat -
eral (GC) transactions, the borrower can supply 
any collateral from a predefined basket of col -
lateral, such as Federal bonds (Bunds) with re -
sidual maturities of up to ten years. While the 
lender does not know exactly which security it 
will receive, it can gauge the credit quality and 
potentially the market liquidity of the security 
in advance comparatively well. In specific col -
lateral (SC) transactions, the lender receives a 
specific security previously stipulated on the 
basis of the securities identification number. 
The motives for concluding SC and GC transac -
tions are usually different. GC transactions are 
used primarily for liquidity management, espe -
cially on the part of the lender. SC transactions 
are often conducted with the aim of borrowing 
a specific security, for example to fulfil a deliv -
ery obligation. However, borrowers may also 
use them for liquidity management purposes, 
for example if they try to use their available col -
lateral for refinancing in a cost- effective man -
ner, given different interest rates for SC and GC 
transactions.9
Due to its size and its increased importance for 
banks’ liquidity management compared to the 
unsecured market, the secured money market 
is relevant for the analysis of monetary policy 
transmission, particularly with regard to the 
transmission of key interest rates to banks’ 
marginal liquidity and funding costs, and thus 
to the interest rate conditions in the financial 
and credit markets. In addition, many securities 
used as collateral are also acquired by the Euro -
system through the monetary policy asset pur -Increasing

7 The development of the unsecured money market is ex -
plored in more detail in Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).
8 “Repo” is shorthand for “sale and repurchase agree -
ment”. Other secured money market transactions, which, 
however, hardly differ from repos, include securities lend -
ing and securities swaps.

primarily attributable to SC transactions, while turnover in 
GC transactions has declined, partly in line with unsecured 
transactions.Deutsche Bundesbank

chase programmes. As interest rate conditions 
for bonds in the repo market can influence the 
price formation of these instruments in the 
bond market, the repo market is of relevance 
for the implementation of the asset purchase 
programmes. At the same time, the interest 
rate conditions and the incentives to trade in 
the secured money market are influenced by 
the general conditions stipulated by the central 
bank for holding central bank reserves. It is 
therefore important for monetary policymakers 
to understand the conditions and develop -
ments in the secured money market and the 
interactions with monetary policy.
This article therefore outlines developments in 
the secured money market in recent years and 
explores the impact of the use of monetary 
policy instruments and the business activity of 
central banks on the secured money market. 
The secured money market is impacted in par -
ticular by changes in key interest rates, the 
monetary policy asset purchase programmes, 
and the resulting structural excess liquidity.
Central banks set key 
parameters  for the secured 
money market
As part of liquidity management, market par -
ticipants ensure their short-  term solvency and 
manage their liquidity reserves. If a market par -
ticipant has unneeded liquidity in the form of 
sight deposits at a commercial or central bank, 
they have various options for short- term invest -
ment. For example, the funds can be held as a 
time deposit at a commercial bank, invested in 
bonds with short residual maturities, money 
market paper or money market fund shares, or 
placed in the secured money market through a 
repo transaction.
Only some market participants are able to hold 
credit balances at Eurosystem central banks. 
Alongside commercial banks, these include, in 
particular, public administrations and private-  
law entities that perform duties of public ad -ministrations or process payments for public 
administrations. The central bank acts as a fis -
cal agent for these entities.10 Then there are of -
ficial institutions outside the euro area that 
have their euro reserves managed by a Eurosys -
tem central bank within the framework of Euro -
system reserve management services (ERMS). 
Monetary policy counterparties and non-  
monetary policy counterparties that have cen -
tral bank accounts are sometimes subject to 
different (interest) conditions, which set differ -
ent general conditions for their respective 
money market activity.11
The Eurosystem offers its monetary policy 
counterparties – i.e. credit institutions eligible 
to carry out monetary policy operations – 
liquidity via monetary policy refinancing oper -
ations or the marginal lending facility. The ap -
plicable conditions usually limit the interest 
rates at which monetary policy counterparties 
are prepared to absorb liquidity in the money 
market. If money market rates rise above those 
at which monetary policy counterparties can 
borrow from the central bank – assuming they 
can provide sufficient collateral – they will pre -
fer to obtain funding from the central bank. 
Much the same applies for financial invest -
ment. If money market rates fall below the de -
posit facility rate, it is then more favourable for 
monetary policy counterparties to hold funds 
with the central bank than to place them in the 
money market. For short- term secured money 
market transactions conducted by Eurosystem 
monetary policy counterparties for liquidity 
management purposes, the agreed interest 
rate thus generally lies between the central 
bank’s policy rates for the provision and ab -
sorption of liquidity.Secured money

Non- monetary policy counterparties – such as 
domestic public administrations or foreign cen -
tral banks – have no direct option for taking 
out loans at a Eurosystem national central 
bank. They may, however, hold credit balances 
in accounts at the respective central bank. 
Therefore, for these counterparties, the central 
bank’s interest conditions for account balances, 
which may differ from the deposit rate applic -
able for monetary policy counterparties, are ini -
tially of particular relevance. This applies, for 
example, for central banks outside the euro 
area that want to hold official euro reserves. 
Eurosystem national central banks, such as the 
Bundesbank, allow such market participants to 
hold euro balances in a central bank account 
within the ERMS framework.12 The interest rate 
on central bank accounts for ERMS participants 
is lower than the deposit facility rate.13 There -
fore, for these market participants, investment 
in the market already becomes attractive when 
net interest income is higher than the lower 
interest rate applicable for ERMS participants 
and not only once money market rates exceed 
the deposit facility rate (currently -0.5% per 
year).
Market participants without any central bank 
access – such as large corporations – may make 
similar considerations. For them, however, it is 
not the conditions of the central bank that are 
relevant, but those of commercial banks. As 
deposit guarantees, depending on the applic -
able rules of the respective compensation 
scheme, do not apply to large deposits to an 
unlimited extent, risk considerations may also 
make investment in money market instruments 
appear advantageous even where the interest 
rate is lower than the conditions applicable to 
commercial banks. For the secure short- term 
investment of euro liquidity, these market par -
ticipants may therefore potentially be prepared 
to accept rates lower than the deposit rate. 
This also applies in particular to investments in 
the secured money market, where it is funda -
mentally possible to invest even larger euro 
amounts very safely.Until the deposit facility rate was lowered to 
0% in July 2012, different interest rate condi -
tions applied to the deposit facility, which is 
only available to banks, and credit balances in 
current accounts at the central bank. For the 
most part, no interest was paid on credit bal -
ances in current accounts at the central bank. 
Non- banks with current accounts at the central 
bank therefore had an incentive to invest liquid 
funds in the money market even at positive 
rates lower than the deposit facility rate. As 
central bank accounts, including those held by 
the public sector in particular, have been remu -
nerated at the deposit facility rate since July 
2012, there is, from an earnings and risk per -
spective, now virtually no interest rate advan -
tage for public sector central bank account 
holders to deposit liquid funds at commercial 
banks rather than the central bank. However, 
participants that do not have current accounts 
with the central bank may continue to have in -
centives to trade.14
Alongside the interest rate conditions set by 
the central bank, excess liquidity in the banking 
system – i.e. the amount of central bank re -
serves in excess of the banking system’s reserve 
requirement – also affects market participants’ 
incentives to trade. A notable amount of excess 
liquidity can, on the one hand, be caused by 
demand from commercial banks if they re -
quest, and are allocated, more liquidity in the 
Eurosystem’s refinancing operations on aggre -
gate than is needed to meet the reserve re -
quirement. This is particularly the case with the 
policy of full allotment for refinancing oper -
ations that has been employed by the Eurosys -
tem since autumn 2008. On the other hand,

central banks do not compete against commercial banks

ently of demand through asset purchases by 
the central bank. The more reserves that mar -
ket participants –  particularly banks, but in -
creasingly also public sector entities and for -
eign central banks – hold, or are required to 
hold, with the central bank on aggregate, the 
lower their incentive is to proactively obtain 
additional funds on the money market. In par -
ticular, money market turnover –  including 
secured money market transactions within the 
scope of liquidity management  – between 
banks that hold substantial amounts of excess 
liquidity falls away.
The various incentives for activity on the money 
market have two significant implications for 
the interest rates at which money market trad -
ing takes place. First, an increase in excess 
liquidity ensures a reduction in money market 
rates since the money supply grows and de -
mand falls. Second, market activity shifts to -
wards transactions for which incentives to 
trade still exist under certain interest rate condi -
tions and in light of the excess liquidity. Most of 
these are transactions where the lender has no 
central bank access and is seeking an invest -
ment opportunity for euro balances, while the 
borrower has access to central bank funds and 
is compensated for borrowing additional liquid -
ity by receiving an interest rate below the de -
posit facility rate. Thus, the deposit facility rate 
does not constitute a general lower bound for 
the interest rate conditions of liquidity- driven 
money market transactions.
In addition to the interest rates for deposits 
held at the central bank and the quantity of ex -
cess liquidity, the relative scarcity of securities 
used as collateral is significant for the interest 
rate conditions for secured money market 
transactions. Interest rate conditions in the 
secured money market are sometimes notice -
ably affected by shifts in the holder structure of 
the securities, such as those linked to the Euro -
system’s monetary policy asset purchase pro -
grammes. A shortage of these securities can 
arise if securities purchasers do not lend their 
holdings on the repo market. This can cause the corresponding repo rates to be significantly 
below the deposit facility rate at times, too.15 
In order to limit potential scarcity- induced con -
straints on the functionality of repo and bond 
markets resulting from the Eurosystem’s asset 
purchase programmes, the Eurosystem offers 
the bonds it has purchased to be borrowed 
against eligible collateral – including cash col -
lateral.
In addition to the framework conditions set out 
by monetary policy, changes to the regulatory 
framework for credit institutions have had an 
impact on the secured money market over the 
past few years. The introduction of the lever -
age ratio (LR), the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
and the buffer for global systemically important 
institutions (G-  SII buffer) have proved particu -
larly significant in this context.16 These factors 
will not be discussed in further detail here since 
they have less of a bearing on the longer- term 
development of short- term interest rate condi -
tions on the secured money market considered 
in this article.17
Development of secured 
money market rates from a 
monetary policy perspective
Over the past few years, activity on the secured 
money market has been influenced in a variety 
of ways by changed framework conditions and 
incentives. To external observers, market devel -
opments are visible in the form of aggregate 
secured money market rates that are each 
based on specific measurement concepts. Ag -

15 At the same time, a purchase programme can also lead 
to rising demand for certain securities in the repo market if 
traders increasingly cover their delivery obligations for 
bonds via the repo market. See Infante and Huh (2021).

(EU) No 575/  2013), Capital Requirements Directive (CRD,

ceived as volume-  weighted means of interest 
rates on transactions with specific maturities. 
These can include, for example, all transactions 
of a trading venue that feature a certain type of 
collateral. Furthermore, the measurement con -
cepts can be based on the sectoral affiliation or 
domicile of the counterparties. Differences in 
shares of GC and SC transactions or of transac -
tions with market participants with no access 
to the central bank can influence the result of 
the measurement to the same degree as differ -
ences in control over the received collateral or 
in the quality of the collateral. These aspects 
can often explain interest rate spreads between 
different aggregate secured money market 
rates.
The RepoFunds Rate is the volume-  weighted 
mean of one- day secured money market trans -
actions concluded on the electronic trading 
platforms BrokerTec18 and MTS.19 A significant 
proportion of electronic trading with European 
government bonds – including centrally cleared 
repo transactions – takes place on these trad -
ing platforms. The RepoFunds Rate incorpor -
ates GC and filtered SC transactions. For the 
RepoFunds Rate, the 25% of SC transactions 
that deviate the most from the volume-  
weighted mean interest rate are removed in an 
iterative process to prevent outliers from dis -
torting the result to an overly strong degree. 
The maturity of the transactions is one business 
day, although the transactions can be settled 
up to two business days after they have been 
concluded.20 Alongside euro area banks, mar -
ket participants also include non- banks and 
banks domiciled outside the euro area that 
have no access to the deposit facility or Euro -
system current accounts. The RepoFunds Rate 
is calculated and published for government 
bonds of different Member States of the euro 
area. In addition, a European RepoFunds Rate 
is calculated that does not distinguish between 
issuers of government bonds. In the next sec -
tion of this article, we will focus on the German 
RepoFunds Rate, i.e. the variant of the Repo -
Funds Rate that covers repo transactions with a 
basket of German government bonds.21The secured money market rate STOXX GC 
Pooling EUR ON (hereinafter referred to as GC 
Pooling ON), which is based on overnight trans -
actions concluded on the trading platform 
Eurex  GC Pooling, is a second key interest rate 
metric for secured money market transac -
tions.22 Any securities in a collateral basket 
– i.e. a list of eligible securities – can be submit -
ted as collateral for a participant’s net money 
liability  to the trading platform.23 In contrast to 
the transactions on BrokerTec and MTS incorp -
orated into the RepoFunds Rate, the securities 
posted as collateral are not actually transferred 
to the (economic) lender.24,25 Strictly speaking, 
GC Pooling ON is thus not the rate of a real 
repo transaction, but a platform- specific inter -
est rate for secured overnight credit. GC Pool -
ing ON is calculated as a volume- weighted 
mean of all transactions for a given trading day 
with no adjustment for outliers. While turnover RepoFunds Rate

18 BrokerTec is a trading platform operated by CME Am -
sterdam B. V. belonging to the US stock exchange group 
CME Group (CME – Chicago Mercantile Exchange).
19 MTS (originally standing for “Mercato generale di titoli 
di Stato”, which roughly translates as “General market for 
government bonds”) is a trading platform that is majority- 
owned by the stock exchange group Euronext N. V. with 
headquarters in Amsterdam.
20 Overnight (ON) transactions are settled on the day 
the  transaction is concluded –  tomorrow/  next (TN) and 
spot/  next (SN) transactions one day or two days after the 
transaction is concluded respectively – and each run until 
the following business day. The largest trading volume of 
SC transactions can usually be found in the SN segment, as 
a settlement period of two business days is also typical in 
the spot market for securities. If a repo transaction is con -
cluded to fulfil the delivery obligation arising from a spot 
transaction in securities trading, both transactions are 
often concluded on the same day.
21 The basket covers fixed, variable- interest or inflation-  
linked German government bonds of any maturity that are 
dominated in euro.
22 The STOXX GC Pooling EUR ON index is available from 
2010. For the preceding period, market activity on Eurex 
GC Pooling is depicted based on all ON transactions in the 
GC Pooling ECB Basket, for which a volume- weighted aver -
age interest rate is calculated, similar to the method used 
for the STOXX GC Pooling index.
23 In the case of GC Pooling ON used here, this is a por -
tion of the collateral accepted by the Eurosystem for refi -
nancing operations with a minimum rating of A-, referred 
to as the ECB basket.
24 From a legal perspective, Eurex Clearing AG is the con -
tracting party in the case of GC Pooling ON; the economic 
counterparties on the other side of a transaction remain 
partly anonymous.
25 Therefore, it is precisely these securities – which, taken 
in isolation, are not scarce – that are likely to be submitted 
as collateral to GC Pooling in most cases.Deutsche Bundesbank

has tended to decline in recent years, the num -
ber of GC Pooling participants has increased 
significantly over time, with non- banks –  or 
market participants without access to Eurosys -
tem central banks – also joining.
Usually, GC Pooling ON is slightly above the 
RepoFunds  Rate (see the chart above). Since SC 
transactions are also included in the RepoFunds 
Rate, repos involving securities for which there 
is high demand – as measured by the available 
supply – are sometimes included. For example, 
this can be the case if market participants in -
creasingly enter into short positions for a spe -
cific security and use a repo to cover the deliv -
ery obligation arising from the short sale. Like -
wise, increased demand can regularly occur at 
the maturity of interest rate futures if market 
participants have a larger amount of delivery 
obligations for certain bonds.26 Greater de -
mand for certain securities on the repo market 
can – if the supply is not fully elastic – lead to 
lower interest rates for repos collateralised by 
these securities than for transactions for which 
the security used as collateral is not scarce. Al -
though a large share of transactions – the 25% 
with interest rates that deviate the most from 
the centre of market activity – is not included in 
the calculation of the RepoFunds Rate, this pro -
cedure is not necessarily designed to determine 
a representative interest rate for secured money market trading. Instead, it depicts conditions in 
the repo market secured by government bonds, 
which, depending on market conditions and 
market activity, can also reflect the scarcity of 
sought- after securities. Against this backdrop, 
an interest spread between the RepoFunds 
Rate and GC Pooling ON can reflect conceptual 
differences between both market segments, 
selection effects regarding the securities traded 
in those segments, as well as the framework 
conditions set out by monetary policy.
Over the past 15 years, the RepoFunds Rate 
and GC Pooling ON have essentially followed 
the path of key interest rates (see the chart 
above). At times when liquidity conditions were 
balanced – e.g. up to October 2008 – these 
money market rates were close to the main re -
financing rate. Since then, the interest rate 
spread between the secured money market 
rates and the relevant key interest rates (main 
refinancing and deposit facility rate, in particu -
lar) has regularly been influenced to a large ex -
tent by the excess liquidity in the banking sys -
tem. Secured money market rates dropped to -Factors influen -

wards the deposit facility rate as the amount of 
excess liquidity grew – comparable with other 
short- term money market rates. However, indi -
vidual episodes caused the secured money 
market rates to deviate from one another (see 
the upper adjacent chart). Although these devi -
ations in 2008 and 2011 remained relatively 
limited in terms of duration and scale, more 
significant and persistent interest rate spreads 
between the two secured money market rates 
were observed from 2015.
In October 2008, the RepoFunds Rate fell sig -
nificantly below the deposit facility rate for a 
number of days, while GC Pooling ON re -
mained within the interest rate corridor (see 
the lower adjacent chart). This was followed by 
another similar episode in 2011-12 (see the 
chart on p. 24). In this case, the interest rate 
spread between the deposit facility rate was 
mostly narrower than in 2008, but this phase 
lasted almost a year – thus considerably longer. 
Both of these periods lie within phases of crisis 
characterised by elevated counterparty risk in 
the banking and financial sector.27 Such risks 
do not usually play an important role in the 
interest rates on secured money market trans -
actions due to the collateral available and given 
their short maturities. Furthermore, wider inter -
est rate spreads were often brought about by 
sharp falls in the RepoFunds Rate, whereas in -
creased levels of counterparty risk are usually 
associated with a rise in money market rates. 
There is thus reason to believe that other fac -
tors were the main drivers behind the develop -
ment of the interest rate spread between GC 
Pooling ON and the (German) RepoFunds Rate.
In times of crisis, various factors can come to -
gether to potentially result in secured money 
market rates declining to a greater extent. This 
includes, in particular, increased demand for 
securities by market participants who, on ac -
count of elevated risks, shift their investments 
from the unsecured to the secured segment 
of the money market or into transactions in -
volving securities with the highest credit qual -
ity. Furthermore, in a crisis situation, market Interest rate

participants  may strive to hedge themselves 
against falling securities prices. Building up un -
covered short positions is one way of doing 
this. To this end, market participants usually 
borrow and sell securities in the repo market in 
order to buy them back at a later date at a 
cheaper price and reverse the repo transac -
tion.28 Market participants can make profits in 
this way if securities prices fall.29
Data on short positions are not available for all 
potential market participants, meaning that it is 
not possible to carry out a full empirical review 
of this hypothesis. The volume of uncovered 
short sales can be derived using securities hold -
ings statistics only for German banks. This re -
veals a considerable increase in short sales of 
German government bonds in 2010 and 2011, 
but these positions are also reduced again 
when repo rates fall – or when costs for hold -
ing short positions rise (see the chart on p. 25). 
The volume of uncovered short positions de -
clined strongly in autumn 2008, too, when the (German) RepoFunds Rate hovered below the 
deposit facility rate. Therefore, the decline in 
the RepoFunds Rate during these phases is not 
likely to have been brought about by the rising 
volumes of uncovered short positions.30
Furthermore, a rise in counterparty risk in the 
banking sector ensures that investments in the 
unsecured money market become less attract -
ive for risk- averse actors, in particular. They 
may favour investments in the repo market, 
which results in downward pressure on secured 
money market rates on account of the in -
creased liquidity supply. This applies, above all, 
if transactions by actors without central bank 
access are significant for the money market 
rate.31 The sharp downward movements in the 
GC rate for German government bonds traded 
on BrokerTec observed in both 2008 and 2011 
are consistent with such a flight to safe- haven 
investments.32 Since, for GC transactions on 
BrokerTec, as is the case for Eurex GC Pooling, 
the focus is usually on obtaining or investing 
liquidity, the rapid decline in interest rate condi -
tions for GC transactions is indicative of an in -
creased liquidity supply during these periods. 
This increased liquidity supply is likely to have 
stemmed, in particular, from market par -
ticipants without central bank access, who, on 
account of the crisis, sought safe short-  term 
financial investments.

28 Arbitrage on the pricing relationship between bonds 
and bond futures, for example, can cause similar shifts in 
supply and demand in the repo market. See Barth and 
Kahn (2020).
29 In the case of government bonds, short selling may po -
tentially be attractive during crises particularly if there is an 
increase in government bond prices that is not caused by a 
general shift to safe- haven investments.
30 The securities holdings statistics data cannot provide 
comprehensive evidence since they are only available once 
per quarter for this period, cover only a small part of the 
total market, and only include uncovered short sales.
31 See European Central Bank (2012). A flight to safe-  
haven investments can have a similar effect if actors in -
creasingly invest their liquidity in safe bonds or rebalance 
their portfolios towards these bonds and subsequently do 
not or only partially offer these in the repo market. The col -
lateral supply available in the repo market falls, which, 
above all, can trigger downward pressure on those repo 
rates that include SC transactions.

The fact that the RepoFunds Rate fell more 
sharply than GC Pooling ON, which even rose 
in part in October 2008, is likely to be attribut -
able to the differing composition of market 
participants. At that time, Eurex GC Pooling 
was used primarily by banks, which, especially 
in 2008, mostly wanted to obtain additional 
liquidity. The RepoFunds Rate, however, is likely 
to have included considerably more transac -
tions involving market participants without 
central bank access, for whom safe liquidity in -
vestments may also be attractive if interest 
rates are below the deposit facility rate. Corres -
pondingly, in cases of sharp rises in excess 
liquidity, the RepoFunds Rate is also likely to 
have fallen to a greater extent than GC Pooling 
ON because market activity saw a larger shift 
towards transactions between market par -
ticipants with central bank access and those 
without central bank access.
The interaction between excess liquidity, inter -
est rate conditions in the money market and 
the composition of money market participants 
can be illustrated for a later period of time 
using the central bank’s balance sheet. Differ -
ent interest rate conditions apply to govern -
ment deposits and deposits of non- euro area 
residents (particularly foreign central banks) at 
the central bank. Government deposits had 
regularly been remunerated at the deposit facil -
ity rate since it became negative in 2014.33 By 
contrast, for the deposits of non- euro area resi -
dents, the conditions of the ERMS apply. In this 
case, deposits above a customer- specific 
threshold are remunerated at an interest rate 
below the deposit facility rate (or can be in -
vested in the money market for a small fee).
General government and foreign central banks 
used their central bank account in correspond -
ingly different ways when the interest rates in 
the secured money market began to fall below 
the deposit facility rate in 2015. Government 
deposits already rose when the RepoFunds 
Rate stood below the deposit facility rate (see 
the chart on p. 26). From this point onwards, 
general government therefore increasingly chose the more favourable investment on its 
central bank account rather than investing its 
money at less favourable conditions in the 
money market. However, deposits stemming 
from non- euro area residents only began to in -
crease at an accelerated pace during the course 
of 2016, when the RepoFunds Rate lowered 
the relevant credit balance remuneration below 
the deposit facility rate, and thus deposits at 
the central bank became more favourable than 
investments in the secured money market. In 
the same vein, deposits also declined again Differing com -

RepoFunds Rate – deposit facility rate2
Monthly
33 The deposit facility rate applies to government deposits 
above a threshold that corresponds to the higher amount 
of €200 million or 0.04% of national gross domestic prod -
uct. When the interest rate on the deposit facility was posi -
tive, government deposits above the threshold were remu -
nerated at 0%. Since the euro overnight index average rate 
(EONIA) was replaced by the euro short- term rate (€STR) as 
the unsecured reference rate on 3 January 2022, these de -
posits have been remunerated at €STR, provided it is below 
the deposit facility rate. See Guideline (EU) 2019/ 671 of the

when the RepoFunds Rate stood above this 
threshold once more in 2019.
The episode beginning in 2015 that saw money 
market rates deviate markedly from the deposit 
facility rate coincided with a period in which 
strains on the banking system were not as pro -
nounced as they had been in the preceding 
years. Counterparty risk played a smaller role 
and there was virtually no crisis- related de -
mand for securities or short selling. Even so, 
during this episode, both the RepoFunds Rate 
and GC Pooling ON were observed to deviate 
persistently from the deposit facility rate over a 
long period of time (see the chart on p. 27). 
Both interest rates left the interest rate corridor, 
moving downwards. In this context, not only 
does the fact that the secured rates left the 
interest rate corridor require explanation, but 
so does the magnitude of the interest rate 
spread between these rates and the deposit fa -
cility rate. For the German RepoFunds Rate, the 
spread stood at around 29 basis points on aver -age for 2017, while GC Pooling ON was just 
around 3 basis points below the deposit facility 
rate. Since 2021, too, interest rate spreads 
–  considerable spreads in some cases  – be -
tween these two rates and the deposit facility 
rate have been observed once more.
The persistent significant deviations of the 
RepoFunds   Rate from the deposit facility rate 
are largely attributable to the Eurosystem’s 
government bond purchases since 2015, which 
amounted to almost €500 billion in 2015 
alone.34 The bonds acquired by the Eurosystem 
were no longer directly available to market par -
ticipants as collateral for repo transactions. This 
resulted in the ongoing purchases reducing the 
supply of bonds in the repo market. As a con -
sequence, it became more expensive for mar -
ket participants to obtain certain securities in 
the repo market.35 This effect has since been 
amplified by the purchases being limited to 
bonds with yields above the deposit facility 
rate. In doing so, the Eurosystem focused its 
purchases, in part, on bonds with longer re -
sidual maturities, which were observed to gen -
erally exhibit lower repo rates as a result. Sub -
sequently, the (German) RepoFunds Rate saw a 
considerable decline. The interest rate spread 
between the RepoFunds Rate and GC Pooling 
ON, which is fairly large at times, should there -
fore also be interpreted as an indicator of the 
relative scarcity of the bonds usable as collat -
eral. Government bonds of other euro area 
Member States were less severely impacted by 
these effects, probably also owing to lower de -
mand in the repo market relative to outstand -
ing volume. The clearly declining repo rates im -
pacted German banks as well. These effects are 
described in more detail in the box on p. 29.From 2015

Towards the end of 2016, the interest rate 
spread between the RepoFunds Rate and the 
deposit facility rate reached its greatest extent. 
Changed conditions for purchase programmes 
and securities lending by the Eurosystem ultim -
ately caused the interest rate spread to grad -
ually narrow: from January 2017 on, the Euro -
system also acquired shorter- term government 
bonds with yields below the deposit facility 
rate. Consequently, the purchases were able to 
be distributed across a broader spectrum of 
maturities. In addition, the Eurosystem also ac -
cepted cash collateral for securities lending, 
within certain limits, as of December 2016.36 
On the one hand, this made securities lending 
more easily accessible, as a comparable security 
no longer needed to be provided as collateral 
in order to borrow a certain security. On the 
other hand, owing to the acceptance of cash 
collateral, the volume of scarce securities avail -
able to the market overall was expanded. As a 
consequence, increasing use was made of the 
Eurosystem’s securities lending and the scarcity 
premiums in the repo market declined (see the 
chart on p.  28).37 With the increase in asset 
purchases by the Eurosystem from March 2020 
onwards, both the scarcity premiums and the 
use of securities lending picked up again. Fol -
lowing a change in the price conditions of 
securities lending in November 2020, the vol -
umes can only be compared with earlier values 
to a limited extent.38
GC Pooling ON also stood below the deposit 
facility rate between 2017 and 2019 and from 
2020 onwards, but with a considerably nar -
rower spread than the RepoFunds Rate. In the 
case of Eurex GC Pooling, the collateral is no 
longer usable for the collateral taker.39 In add -
ition, a significantly wider range of collateral 
–  potentially with lower credit quality, too  – 
can be used than for transactions included in 
the German RepoFunds Rate. A mere decrease 
in the holdings of German government bonds 
available to the repo market is therefore not a 
decisive factor behind the decline in GC Pool -
ing ON below the deposit facility rate. One ex -
planation is, however, provided by the very high excess liquidity in the banking system aris -
ing from various monetary policy measures and 
the associated lower demand for liquidity in 
the face of increased supply in the money mar -
ket. As interbank transactions were barely Expanded secur -

Automated Securities Lending (ASL), which ensures that 
borrowers’ trades do not fail, since April 2015, and ASLplus, 
where securities can be borrowed for purposes other than

38 The Eurosystem central banks are geared towards pri -
cing that ensures that the Eurosystem’s securities lending 
facilities serve as an effective backstop, i.e. they should 
support bond and repo market liquidity without excessively 
influencing usual market activity. The minimum fee for 
lending transactions against cash collateral was lowered in 
November 2020 from 30 basis points to 20 basis points 
below the deposit facility rate. The minimum interest rate 
spread for repo transactions against securities collateral 
was reduced from 10 basis points to 5 basis points. This 
caused the volume of borrowed securities to rise.

needed any longer for short- term redistribu -
tions of liquidity, liquidity- driven money market 
transactions were primarily concluded by banks 
as liquidity takers and non- banks as liquidity 
providers. As many non- banks do not have any 
access to central bank accounts, interest rates 
in the unsecured money market also trade 
below the deposit facility rate, such as the 
overnight interest rate €STR, which is based on 
data from the money market statistics.40 The 
moderate decline in GC Pooling ON below the 
deposit facility rate should therefore be seen as 
consistent with the general development of 
interest rate conditions for liquidity- driven 
transactions in the money market.
Summary and discussion
Considerable and persistent interest rate 
spreads between aggregate money market 
rates can materialise as a result of monetary 
policy framework conditions for the money market, but also due to determinants outside 
of monetary policy. Over the past few years, 
this has held especially true for the secured 
money market, as, alongside the composition 
of market participants and the supply of and 
demand for liquidity, securities- related effects 
can also play a role. The Eurosystem has exerted 
considerable influence on the availability of 
liquidity and securities through the high excess 
liquidity and its monetary policy asset purchase 
programmes (including the corresponding 
securities lending). Against this backdrop, set -
ting the conditions for the monetary policy and 
non- monetary policy counterparties of the na -
tional central banks is a key determinant of the 
remuneration of secured money market trans -
actions. Secured money market transactions 
are affected unevenly by these changes, de -
pending on the choice of security, alternative 
investment options for counterparties, and 
trading venue. At times, secured money market 
rates that differ on account of these aspects 
thus also provide vastly different measurement 
results for the interest rate conditions in the 
secured money market.
This means that changes in certain interest rate 
spreads often do not reflect changes in the 
monetary policy stance. They can, however, be 
triggered indirectly by monetary policy, for ex -
ample if asset purchases reduce the availability 
of securities for the repo market. Such indirect 
effects can, however, be limited by adjustments 
in the implementation of monetary policy, such 
as through securities lending. For this reason, 
an understanding of the conditions in the 
money market as a whole can only be obtained 
by looking at different money market rates sim -
ultaneously, taking into account the respective 
monetary policy context.The Bundesbank's bilateral securities

The impact of collateral scarcity on bank lending
Interest rates on secured money market trans-
actions with German government bonds have 
fallen signifi  cantly since 2015, and this has 
had two direct effects. For market participants 
looking to invest in these government bonds, 
it has become more expensive to borrow the 
securities in the secured money market. The 
holders of these government bonds, mean-
while, have been able to obtain funding in the 
secured money market at lower costs if they 
use the bonds as collateral. This box explains 
how these lower funding costs have impacted 
German banks and their lending.1
Since banks hold different bonds in their port-
folios, the change in interest rates in the 
secured money market has not affected them 
all in the same way. This is because, as re-
vealed by analyses of a dataset that merges 
money market statistics with securities hold-
ings statistics, banks often use their existing 
bond portfolios as collateral when raising cap-
ital. At the same time, banks respond to 
changes in secured money market rates by 
borrowing more against collateral that allows 
them to do so at particularly low interest 
rates. The combined effect is that, depending 
on their securities portfolios, banks are af-
fected differently by scarcity- induced interest 
rate fl  uctuations in the secured money mar-
ket, which is likely to cause banks’ funding 
costs to diverge.
In fact, data from the money market statistics 
can be used to show that banks holding rela-
tively scarce bonds on their balance sheet 
have lower funding costs in the secured 
money market. At the same time, there is an 
increase in those banks’ profi  ts from secured 
money market transactions.
Assuming that these banks pass on the re-
duced funding costs to their customers in the 
form of lower lending rates, it is generally 
conceivable that they will also expand their 
lending. Using the Bundesbank’s balance 
sheet statistics, it can be shown that a decline in the funding costs for a bank’s securities 
portfolio does indeed lead to stronger credit 
growth, all other things being equal. The fact 
that this phenomenon is observable only for 
banks that were active in the secured repo 
market supports the hypothesis that the re-
duced funding costs probably did prompt the 
stronger credit growth.
This fi  nding can also be obtained on the basis 
of data from the Bundesbank’s credit register 
for loans of €1 million or more, in which credit 
growth can be traced at the individual bor-
rower level. By comparing credit growth of 
the same borrower at banks with different 
levels of funding costs, one can rule out the 
possibility that the effect on credit growth is 
being driven by stronger credit demand.2
In addition, the Bundesbank’s interest rate 
statistics also offer further insight into the 
transmission channel. The lending rates that a 
bank charges for short- term loans to enter-
prises correlate signifi  cantly with the funding 
costs of its securities portfolio, with the result 
that lower interest rates in the secured money 
market were accompanied by lower lending 
rates for short- term loans to enterprises at 
those banks that had holdings of scarce 
bonds. The lower lending rates, in turn, led to 
stronger growth in short- term loans to enter-
prises at banks that saw the funding costs for 
their securities portfolios decline.
Overall, the fi  ndings show that collateral scar-
city in the repo market had an expansionary 
impact on credit growth at banks with hold-
ings of these securities.
1 See Tischer (2021).
2 See Khwaja and Mian (2008). If the credit growth 
were triggered by increased demand, a given borrow-
er’s credit growth would not be expected to differ sys-
tematically from one lender to the next because de-
mand affects all lenders in equal measure. In that case, 
it would no longer be possible to identify any effect of 
funding costs on credit growth.Deutsche Bundesbank

On the basis of the European treaties, the Euro -
system acts in accordance with market econ -
omy principles. It is therefore fundamentally 
not the task of the Eurosystem, alongside man -
aging the general interest rate level, to also 
purposefully influence price formation in indi -
vidual financial market segments. If interest 
rate spreads widen in the financial markets, then this is in principle welcome and an expres -
sion of functioning markets. In this context, the 
Eurosystem’s securities lending does not have 
the function of managing interest rate condi -
tions in the repo market, but instead merely 
mitigates the undesirable consequences of 
monetary policy asset purchase programmes 
for the repo market.

Climate change and climate policy: 
analytical  requirements and options from 
a central bank perspective
Ever since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the global average temperature has been increas -
ing significantly. Most of this global warming is attributable to human activities. The effects of 
climate  change on people and the environment are already being felt, and there is a risk of con -
siderable damage in the long term. With that in mind, there is a broad consensus that appropri -
ate measures need to be taken to combat climate change. Initiatives to this end are under way. 
Both climate change and climate policy will have far- reaching implications for macroeconomic 
developments, which is why central banks need to engage with this topic.
Alongside the macroeconomic effects of extreme weather events and gradually rising tempera -
tures, attention is likely to turn to the impact of climate policy, in particular, in the near future. 
Measures such as significantly increasing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions are aimed at trig -
gering far- reaching economic adjustment processes. This means that it is not only climate change 
itself but also climate policy that will affect different sectors to varying degrees. It stands to rea -
son that certain regions, too, will be more heavily affected than others. These disparities could 
affect macroeconomic dynamics and monetary policy transmission. Climate change and climate 
policy may also give rise to risk concentrations that contribute to the build- up of systemic risk in 
the financial system and thus pose a potential threat to financial stability. The Bundesbank pre -
sented an initial analysis of the risks posed by climate action to the German financial system as 
part of its 2021 Financial Stability Review. Additionally, climate change and climate policy have a 
significant global dimension. All countries need to play their part in combating climate change. 
Action lacking sufficient coordination at the international level may result in distortions. All of this 
poses additional challenges to macroeconomic analysis, which is key to monetary policy and 
macroprudential decision- making. The Bundesbank is therefore adapting its analytical toolkit with 
the aim of being able to adequately study adjustment processes driven by climate change and 
climate policy, examining their sectoral and regional dimensions in an international context.Deutsche Bundesbank

Relevance of climate change 
and climate policy for central 
banks
Ever since the start of the Industrial Revolution, 
the global average temperature has been rising 
significantly. It has been proven that most of 
this global warming is due to anthropogenic 
emissions of greenhouse gases.1 There is also 
strong evidence to suggest that rising tempera -
tures will spur further changes in the climate.2
Some of the effects triggered by global climate 
change are already being felt. These include 
the greater frequency and intensity of extreme 
weather events such as heat waves, dry spells 
and torrential rainfall.3 Such effects are ex -
pected to be amplified as the climate continues 
to warm. Climate action is therefore one of the 
biggest challenges facing society today, and it 
is the task of governments and parliaments to 
set this in motion via climate policy.Particular political challenges arise from the 
global dimension of climate change and cli -
mate policy. Global efforts are required to com -
bat climate change. This is why, on top of na -
tional initiatives, international agreements such 
as the Paris Agreement have a crucial role to 
play. In addition, the risk of irreversible climate 
change means there is greater urgency to act.4
Central banks also have to deal with climate 
change and climate policy. Climate change and 
climate policy influence macroeconomic devel -
opments and may affect price and financial sta -
bility. This may make it more difficult for central 
banks to fulfil their tasks.5
For example, physical risks such as rising aver -
age temperatures or more frequent extreme 
weather events may cause lasting harm to ag -
gregate potential growth. Since the equilibrium 
real interest rate also depends on aggregate 
potential output, this would narrow the room 
for manoeuvre for conventional monetary pol -
icy measures. A lower equilibrium real interest 
rate increases the likelihood of monetary policy 
hitting the zero lower bound.6 The conse -
quences of climate change may also put pres -
sure on the financial system and thereby make 
monetary policy transmission more difficult if, 
for example, extreme weather events are ac -
companied by substantial financial losses.
There are also transition risks associated with 
greening the economy. Measures such as sig -
nificantly increasing the cost of greenhouse gas 
emissions are aimed at triggering far- reaching 
economic adjustment processes. This, too, may 
make it more difficult to safeguard price and 
financial stability if, for example, profound 
structural change triggers a widespread revalu -Global warming

ation of assets.7 Risks could also arise from 
changes in consumer behaviour brought on by 
the transition or from technological progress 
driven by climate policy.
Physical and transition risks can be considered 
dynamic processes that interact with one an -
other. These risks can be reduced in general by 
a forward- looking, predictable climate policy, 
whereas physical risks will mount in the face of 
climate policy inaction, with the threat of ab -
rupt climate policy adjustments further down 
the line and ensuing transition risks.
Climate change and climate policy therefore 
present monetary policy analysis with new 
challenges, too. Expectations or uncertainty 
about the occurrence and extent of climate 
damage as well as the future course of climate 
policy may influence economic activity.8 Cli-
mate risks may also make it more difficult to 
identify economic drivers and prepare macro -
economic projections.9
The global dimension of climate change and 
climate policy makes macroeconomic analysis 
particularly challenging. Looking at countries in 
isolation paints an incomplete picture of both 
the causes and the consequences of climate 
change.10 The effects of climate action, too, 
are felt across national borders.
The international distribution of physical and 
transition risks is also relevant to monetary pol -
icy because of its possible consequences, espe -
cially for a currency union such as the euro 
area. It is a similar story with respect to the ac -
cumulation of climate risks in certain sectors. 
Climate change and climate policy may give 
rise to risk concentrations that contribute to 
the build- up of systemic risk in the financial sys -
tem and pose a potential threat to financial sta -
bility.11Adjusting the analytical toolkit
To meet these challenges, it is necessary to re -
view and, where necessary, adjust the monet -
ary policy analytical toolkit. This is also true of 
macroeconomic analysis, which is key to mon -
etary policy decision- making. Following the 
Euro system’s latest monetary policy strategy re -
view, the ECB therefore announced that it 
would expand its analytical capacity in macro -
economic modelling with regard to climate 
change and climate policy.12
This includes, inter alia, incorporating macro -
economic climate models, known as integrated 
assessment models (IAMs). The combination of 
model elements from economics and climate 
research is characteristic of this model class. 
The idea behind this is to capture the interde -
pendence of climate and economic activity in a 
relatively simple way.13 In an IAM, it is usually 
assumed that greenhouse gases are emitted in 
the course of economic activity. This subse -
quently leads to an increase in the global aver -
age temperature, which in turn has an impact 
on economic activity. This can be represented, 
for example, by a functional relationship be -
tween the average global temperature and 
output: the damage function.
On the basis of such models, costs and benefits 
can be weighed against each other to deter -
mine optimal emission pathways and thus con -
sistent climate action.14 Alternatively, a climate 
policy goal can be specified directly, for ex -
ample in the form of a global average tempera -
ture or a cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The 
agents in the model then make their decisions 
subject to this constraint.… interact with

However, the macroeconomic effects of cli -
mate change and climate policy can also be 
examined using modelling approaches that 
more closely resemble the macroeconomic an -
alysis traditionally conducted by central banks. 
For example, established econometric methods 
can be used to estimate the macroeconomic 
impact of climate change.15 In addition, struc -
tural macroeconomic models, such as dynamic 
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models,16 
can be modified in such a way that they can be 
used to investigate the consequences of ex -
treme weather and the effects of climate pol -
icy.17 Using models of this kind, macroeco -
nomic adjustment processes can be examined 
in more detail than is possible with macroeco -
nomic climate models. The environmental 
multi- sector DSGE model EMuSe, which was 
developed at the Bundesbank, can be used in 
particular to analyse adjustment processes 
driven by climate policy in an international con -
text and flexibly adapted to various policy ques -
tions (see the box on pp. 50 ff.).18
Macroeconomic effects of 
climate change
The concentration of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere has been rising steadily for around 
200 years.19 This trend, which is due largely to the use of fossil fuels, is amplifying the natural 
greenhouse effect. In Earth’s atmosphere, the 
balance between incoming and outgoing solar 
radiation is changing in such a way that net 
solar radiation is increasing.20 Climate projec -
tions show that, in the absence of climate pol -
icy intervention, this trend will continue.21 
However, there is still uncertainty as to how 
much the heightened concentration of green -
house gases in the atmosphere will affect the 
global average temperature.22 The expected re -
gional distribution of temperature changes is 
especially fraught with uncertainty. In addition 
to rising global temperatures, climate change is 
accompanied by a host of other effects, some 
varying quite widely from region to region. 
These include rising sea levels, changing pre -
cipitation patterns and more frequent and 
more extreme weather events.23
It is already clear today that climate change will 
bring irreversible changes in its wake.24 In add -
ition to the direct effects, this will result in fur -
ther adjustment processes. Both the direct con -
sequences and the adjustment processes that 
they trigger will affect the economy as a whole.Deployment and

Gradual temperature increase
The gradual increase in average temperatures 
affects economic activity in a variety of ways, 
with the impact depending on the initial tem -
perature. Human health and performance suf -
fer at high temperatures.25 As a result, when 
certain temperature thresholds are exceeded, it 
is not just productivity but also labour input 
that decreases.26 Climate- related migration can 
also have repercussions for employment.27 
Where initial temperatures are low, however, a 
temperature increase could have a positive ef -
fect on labour input and productivity.28
The increase in average temperatures also af -
fects the production factor capital. A distinc -
tion should be made between different types 
of capital. On the one hand, a lasting impact 
on natural capital is foreseeable. For example, 
increasing water scarcity may affect output in 
certain regions.29 By contrast, some countries 
would stand to benefit temporarily from a tem -
perature rise, since the production conditions 
for certain goods, such as those in agriculture, 
would improve.30
On the other hand, gradual warming may have 
consequences for the physical capital stock. For 
example, infrastructure and production facil -
ities could conceivably be damaged or age 
faster as a result of increased temperatures.31 
Indirect effects stem from the need to adjust 
the capital stock to evolving environmental 
conditions or from changes in investment be -
haviour.32 This is detrimental if, on account of 
climate considerations, it comes at the expense 
of more productive investment alternatives and 
the efficiency gains that they would have 
brought with them have to be sacrificed.33 A 
downturn in investor sentiment triggered by 
climate change – for example, as a result of in -
creased uncertainty or more pessimistic expect -
ations about the future – may even dampen 
the general propensity to invest, with far-  
reaching consequences for growth and pros -
perity.34A temperature increase can also have eco -
nomic effects via structural changes in de -
mand. Economic agents’ preferences could 
conceivably change as a result of improved in -
formation about the long- term impact of con -
sumption and investment decisions on the cli -
mate.35
The effects described here may vary signifi -
cantly across regions, economic sectors and 
periods under consideration. For example, the 
adverse effects of temperature increases will be 
particularly evident in regions that are already 
hot.36 When certain thresholds, or climatic tip -
ping points,37 are reached, the effects on the 
economy as a whole can sometimes be devas -
tating.38 From a sectoral perspective, there is 
strong evidence of adverse implications for 
agriculture, in particular.39 However, there are

ing and certain services sectors, too.40 In add -
ition, it must be borne in mind that the macro -
economic impact at the sectoral or local level is 
also associated with spillover effects resulting 
from economic and financial linkages.
The macroeconomic importance of tempera -
ture changes very much depends on whether 
their effects are permanent.41 A number of em -
pirical studies indicate that changes in the aver -
age temperature affect aggregate growth, with 
evidence of non- linear relationships.42 Bundes -
bank estimations for a panel of European coun -
tries come to a similar conclusion (for details, 
see the box on pp. 39 ff.). According to these 
results, an increase in the annual average tem -
perature dampens economic growth when a 
certain threshold is exceeded. The estimated 
threshold for the annual average temperature 
is just over 9°C.
Based on the estimations, the effects of the 
gradual warming observed in recent decades 
have varied widely across Europe. While this 
warming seems to have boosted economic de -
velopments in some northern European coun -
tries so far because of their lower initial tem -
peratures, the opposite was the case for a 
number of southern countries. It also follows 
from the estimations that a progressive tem -
perature increase would adversely affect 
macroeconomic developments in Europe in the 
long term, with considerable growth differen -
tials sometimes emerging, even amongst euro 
area economies.43 Compared with other world 
regions, however, the loss in output growth in 
Europe would be rather small (see also the box 
on pp. 43 f.).44
Estimates of this kind are fraught with consid -
erable uncertainty. First, there is a fundamental 
degree of estimation and specification uncer -
tainty. For example, international interdepend -
encies are not adequately taken into account in 
the approach adopted here, but they can be 
significant. Second, it should be noted that the 
estimations reflect historical developments. 
Any statements they lead to regarding the fu -ture must come with a caveat. They would 
need adjusting if there were significant techno -
logical advances that had an impact on the cli -
mate or if climatic tipping points became rele -
vant, for example.
Nevertheless, the findings described above cor -
respond to projections of macroeconomic cli -
mate models. According to IAM simulations, 
too, labour productivity in Europe would suffer 
as a result of progressive warming. However, 
losses would be significantly lower than in 
other regions of the world.45 Within Europe, 
damage in the south would be significantly 
greater in the long term than in the centre or 
north of the continent.
However, IAM simulations are likewise subject 
to significant model uncertainty, particularly in 
terms of the specification of the damage func -
tion. Depending on the assumed functional re -
lationship and the parametrisation, there can 
be major differences in terms of probable eco -
nomic losses.46,47Empirical find -

40 Output losses in certain services sectors are identified by 
Hsiang (2010) for Central and South American countries 
and by Colacito et al. (2018) for the United States. Effects 
on output in manufacturing or industry are shown by Ace -
vedo et al. (2020) for the United States, Deschênes et al. 
(2018) for firms in China and Dell et al. (2012) in a global 
panel. Burke et al. (2015) document non- linear effects for 
the agricultural and non- agricultural sector.
41 See Fankhauser and Tol (2005), Stern (2013), Tol (2018) 
and Piontek et al. (2019).
42 See, inter alia, Dell et al. (2012), Dell et al. (2014) and 
Burke et al. (2015).
43 For example, the projected cumulative damage is many 
times higher for Spain and Portugal than for Germany.
44 Burke et al. (2015) even derive positive macroeconomic 
effects of a progressive rise in temperature for Europe from 
an estimation using global data.

The impact of changing temperatures on macroeconomic 
developments in Europe
Over the last few decades, average tem-
peratures in Europe have increased mark-
edly. This global warming impacts upon 
economic activity in various ways. Inter-
national studies show that high tempera-
tures lead to reduced working hours and 
lower labour productivity.1 Barely any stud-
ies of this nature have been conducted for 
Europe.2
Panel regressions provide a means of study-
ing the impact of changing temperatures 
on economic growth. The growth rate of 
gross domestic product (GDP) in year t 
in country i (Δyi,t) is regressed on the re-
spective average annual temperature 
(Ti,t).3 Based on relevant studies, it is as-
sumed that temperature changes them-
selves are not infl  uenced by economic 
growth.4 The model also incorporates the 
average precipitation ( Ri,t) and lagged val-
ues of the GDP growth rate (Δyi,t–1), coun-try fi  xed (ai) and year fi  xed effects ( at) and 
a residual: (εi,t):5
1 See, inter alia, Hsiang (2010), Dell et al. (2014), Graff 
Zivin and Neidell (2014), Deryugina and Hsiang (2014), 
Burke et al. (2015) and Colacito et al. (2018).
2 One exception is Holtermann and Rische (2020), 
which focuses on the relationship between regional 
growth and temperatures in the European Nomenclat-
ure of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)-classifi  ed 
regions  of the EU15 countries.
3 The model is based on earlier studies of the global 
impact of rising temperatures; see Burke et al. (2015) 
and Dell et al. (2012).
4 See Auffhammer et al. (2013).
5 In view of the strong correlation between precipita-
tion and temperature data, it seems appropriate to in-
clude both variables (see Auffhammer et al. (2013)). 
The country fi  xed effects control for time- invariant dif-
ferences between the growth rates, while year fi  xed 
effects capture joint trend movements and year- 
specifi  c one- off effects. The estimated temperature 
effect  is thus derived from country- specifi  c deviations 
in the GDP growth rate and in the average annual tem-
perature from the European average (see Burke et al. 
(2015)).

Here, the quadratic terms allow non- linear 
relationships to be captured.6 Data for 35 
European countries (all 27 EU Member 
States as well as Albania, Bosnia and Herze-
govina, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Ser-
bia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) 
for the period from 1961 to 2020 are in-
cluded in the estimation.7
The regression results for the group of 
countries under review indicate that the 
average annual temperature has a marked 
impact on economic growth. The linear 
effect  (β1 = 0.48)  and quadratic effect 
(β2 = – 0.03) of the average temperature 
both show a statistically signifi  cant differ-
ence from zero at the 95% confi  dence level. 
The negative quadratic effect implies that 
the effect of a rise in temperature is de-
pendent on the initial temperature. Starting 
from a low temperature, a rise in tempera-
ture is benefi  cial; starting from a high tem-
perature, it has adverse effects. The thresh-
old differentiating low temperatures from 
high temperatures is 9.3°C.8 Furthermore, the greater the gap between the initial 
tempera ture and the threshold value, the 
stronger the estimated impact of tempera-
ture on GDP .
More in- depth analyses show that the 
established  temperature effect is essentially 
driven by the summer months. When the 
annual GDP growth rate is regressed on the 
6 Statistical tests, too, favour a quadratic relationship 
between GDP growth rates and the average tempera-
ture over a linear relationship. A quadratic relationship 
is also supported in international studies (see Burke et 
al. (2015)).
7 Temperature and precipitation data are taken from 
the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East An-
glia, which aggregates the data from individual wea-
ther stations at the country level using geographical 
distance weighting. The time series can be down-
loaded from the World Bank’s Climate Change Know-
ledge Portal. For the analyses, the monthly tempera-
tures were consolidated as an annual or quarterly aver-
age. The GDP growth rates are taken from the World 
Bank’s World Development Indicators. The model is 
estimated on the basis of an unbalanced panel dataset 
(for more information, see, inter alia, Cameron and 
Trivedi (2005)).
8 The results are in line with the fi  ndings of related 
studies. A negative effect on GDP growth is produced 
in a global panel given an average annual temperature 
of 13°C or above (Burke et al. (2015)) or 9.2°C or 
above for regional growth rates in the EU15 (Holter-
mann and Rische (2020)).Estimated impact of the temperature increase between 1960 and 2020 on growth

average temperatures and precipitation for 
the four quarters of the year (rather than 
the annual average), a statistically signifi  -
cant relationship is only seen for the sum-
mer quarter.9 In addition, the estimated 
effect  is signifi  cantly stronger than the im-
pact of the average temperature in terms of 
the year as a whole. This suggests that tem-
perature increases during the other quarters 
of the year tend to counteract the growth- 
inhibiting effect of the hotter summer 
months.10
These estimation results indicate that the 
temperature increase has had a very varied 
impact on economic growth in the individ-
ual European countries to date. Between 
1960 and 2020, the average rise in tem-
perature in the European countries each 
year was between 0.01°C and 0.04°C. 
Using the estimated coeffi   cients, the aver-
age growth effect for each country can be 
calculated from this.11 While northern Euro-
pean countries appear to have benefi  ted 
from the rising temperatures, adverse 
effects  are found in parts of southern 
Europe .12 In Finland, the annual GDP 
growth rate is likely to have risen by around 
1.1 percentage points between 1960 and 
2020 on account of the temperature effect, 
according to the estimates. In Cyprus or 
Malta, by contrast, it probably decreased by 
between 0.7 and 0.9 percentage point. No 
statistically signifi  cant effects can be seen 
for western and central Europe, as the aver-
age temperatures in these countries were 
close to the threshold value of 9.3°C during 
this period. Around this mark, the macro-
economic impact of a rise in temperature is 
either zero or very slight.
When interpreting these results, it should 
be borne in mind that estimation uncer-
tainty is high, due in part to sharply fl  uctu-
ating average annual temperatures over 
time, in some cases. Furthermore, only his-
torical relationships were analysed, and not 
all economic effects of climate change were 
systemically captured. This applies to the 
impact of extreme weather events,13 for ex-
ample, and the spillover effects of climate 
change in other regions of the world. More-over, it should be noted that the impact of 
further rises in temperature may differ from 
historical relationships. For instance, the 
macroeconomic costs after passing a cli-
matic tipping point could be signifi  cantly 
higher.14 Adapting to climate change – say, 
by means of technical innovations – could, 
on the other hand, reduce the adverse im-
pact on economic growth.15 These consid-
erations aside, however, the estimates pro-
vide clear indications that a further rise in 
temperatures would likely weaken eco-
nomic growth in Europe and create a 
growth divide.
9 Similar results emerge for the United States and Cen-
tral America (see Hsiang (2010) and Colacito et al. 
(2018)).
10 A decline in the number of icy days in the winter 
quarters, for instance, can have a positive impact on 
GDP (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2014) and Bloesch 
and Gourio (2015)). In the cold northern European 
countries, more in- depth studies identify a rise in tem-
perature in winter and spring as having a positive 
effect  on GDP growth.
11 Here, the aggregate impact is P2020
s=1961⇢2020s[β1(Ti,sTi,1960 )+β 2(T2
i,sT2
i,1960 )]. 
The confi  dence bands are calculated using the delta 
method.
12 Macroeconomic climate models also identify vary-
ing effects in the EU countries (see European Commis-
sion (2018)).
13 For information on the impact of extreme weather 
events, see, inter alia, Hsiang and Narita (2012), Lesk 
et al. (2016) and Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b).
14 Tipping points refer to critical thresholds in a sys-
tem that, when exceeded, can lead to a signifi  cant 
change in the state of the system, often with an 
understanding that the change is irreversible. See 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2018).
15 Historically, however, such adaptation has not yet 
had an impact on the relationship between tempera-
ture changes and GDP growth, according to inter-
national studies (see Burke et al. (2015)).Deutsche Bundesbank

Extreme weather events
There is mounting evidence of a link between 
climate change and the frequency, intensity 
and concurrence of weather extremes such as 
storms, floods and droughts.48 Extreme wea -
ther conditions of this kind can bring about dis -
ruptions to supply and demand that are both 
significant in macroeconomic terms and hard 
to predict,49 and which also vary across regions 
and across sectors.50
Such extreme weather events have a direct im -
pact on humans and physical capital in the re -
gions affected.51 There can also be indirect ef -
fects that – at least temporarily – influence eco -
nomic output outside the disaster- hit regions, 
for example if supply chains are disrupted or 
migratory movements are triggered.52
The demand side, too, can be affected by the 
indirect consequences of extreme weather phenomena. When households and firms (par -
ticularly banks and insurers) experience any 
kind of asset losses or increased need for write- 
downs, it acts as a potential damper on con -
sumption and investment demand.53 But indi -
vidual regions or sectors may also see boosts to 
demand, for instance when requests for goods 
or services that at least for a time cannot be 
produced in the disaster- hit area are serviced 
elsewhere. Furthermore, individual sectors may 
profit from work to tackle the damage caused 
and to rebuild.54 Overall, however, sudden ex -
treme weather events are likely to mean eco -
nomic losses, at least in the short term.55
The more frequent occurrence of extreme wea -
ther conditions is likely to make aggregate out -
put and prices more volatile.56 Moreover, a suf -
ficiently strong or abrupt fall in asset prices has 
the potential to pose a threat to financial stabil -
ity.57 Potential output may also be affected, al -
though the direction of the effect is ambiguous 
theoretically. On the one hand, extreme wea -
ther events could conceivably wreak lasting 
damage on natural or physical capital stock, 
thereby weakening aggregate growth. Poten -
tial output could also suffer if private and pub -
lic investment are cut, for instance due to ele -
vated uncertainty or fiscal burdens.58 Further -
more, climate- related adjustment measures

Impact of the gradual rise in temperature on trend growth 
in the German economy
The anticipated gradual rise in temperature 
raises the question as to what impact this 
will have on trend growth in the German 
economy if swift, sustainable action is not 
taken. The macroeconomic consequences 
of global warming can be assessed using 
the scenarios developed by the Network of 
Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS).1 They forecast 
country- specifi  c developments in average 
temperature and gross domestic product 
(GDP) for various emissions pathways.2 
Damage functions are used to establish the 
relationship between developments in the 
temperature and in GDP .3
The damage function in the NGFS scenarios 
is calibrated based on the estimation results 
of the interplay between these two vari-
ables in the past. The values for the calibra-
tion are taken from Kalkuhl and Wenz’s 
global panel study (2020).4 According to 
the estimation results used in the NGFS 
scenarios, a one- off change in temperature 
has a level effect on productivity.5 However, 
if the average annual temperature rises con-
tinuously, the GDP growth rate is lower 
than the level it would be without the rise 
in temperature. According to these scen-
arios, the temperature rise expected in Ger-
many over the course of the current decade 
would result in only low GDP losses.6 As of 
2030, however, if climate change continues 
unabated, the impact is likely to be stronger.
These estimates are subject to high uncer-
tainty for various reasons. First, the extent 
of the rise in temperature for a predefi  ned 
emissions pathway can only be approxi-
mated. This is why the NGFS provides GDP 
damage for various percentiles of potential 
temperature development. The median for GDP losses in Germany in 2100 is 2½%. 
This fi  gure amounts to just over 5% at the 
95th percentile. Second, the relationship 
between average temperature and GDP is 
unclear. As an alternative to the NGFS dam-
age function, it is also possible to use esti-
mation results that document a correlation 
between temperature levels and GDP 
growth rates in European countries (for 
1 See Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for 
Greening the Financial System (2021b). The results ob-
tained come from an international climate research 
consortium. Members include the Potsdam Institute 
for Climate Impact Research (PIK), the International In-
stitute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Univer-
sity of Maryland (UMD), Climate Analytics (CA) and the 
Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zurich (ETH 
Zurich).
2 For more details on the methodology behind the 
scenarios and the models used, see Network of Central 
Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial Sys-
tem (2021c). The results presented here are based on 
the IAM results of the PIK’s REMIND model, broken 
down by country.
3 The construction of the scenarios does not refl  ect 
damage that indirectly affects an economy’s perform-
ance, such as changes to mortality or to the frequency 
of violent confl  ict, or damage to biodiversity and the 
ecosystem. The REMIND IAM can also take account of 
feedback loops and dynamic effects which lead to 
adaptations in capital accumulation or savings, or trig-
ger policy responses to prevent emissions. However, 
such effects do not have a strong bearing on the size 
of climate costs in the NGFS calculations.
4 The dependent productivity variable in these calcula-
tions comprises labour and agricultural productivity as 
well as capital depreciation.
5 The impact of the temperature level on growth of 
per capita GDP is statistically insignifi  cant in the esti-
mations. The estimation equation factors in potential 
non- linearities in the correlation between temperature 
rise and GDP growth. The results demonstrate that a 
rise in temperature is driving economic growth in re-
gions that were originally colder and slowing eco-
nomic growth in areas that are already warmer. This is 
in line with the fi  ndings of other studies.
6 The NGFS’ “Current Policies” scenario, which takes 
into consideration only containment measures that 
have already been implemented, is used for the scen-
ario of unabated climate change. A hypothetical refer-
ence scenario without climate effects is used to calcu-
late the costs of global warming. The GDP pathway in 
this scenario corresponds to trend growth over the 
past few decades, which is adjusted for the impact of 
the coronavirus pandemic using projections made by 
the International Monetary Fund (2020).Deutsche Bundesbank

more details on this, see the box on 
pp.  39 ff.). According to this alternative 
method, the rise in temperature lastingly 
dampens economic growth. In this case, cli-
mate change would have a stronger impact 
on German GDP over the longer term.
In addition, it is important to note that the 
NGFS scenarios do not model climate dam-
age as a result of more frequent extreme 
weather events or of tipping points. Yet, as 
global warming intensifi  es, these will be-
come more likely and entail considerable 
macroeconomic consequences. Another 
factor to be considered is the impact of 
cross- border trade and migration links 
which might cause climate- related GDP 
losses in other countries to spill over into 
Germany.7 Moreover, the comparatively 
small GDP losses in Germany should not 
blind observers to the fact that massive 
global GDP damage is expected.8
The NGFS calculations also indicate the 
extent  to which macroeconomic damage 
can be limited by climate policy measures. 
In the scenario calculations, measures to re-
duce emissions that are introduced early 
and are intensifi  ed evenly over time (shown 
in the orderly NGFS scenarios) can consider-ably reduce both the costs of intervention 
as well as the costs arising as a result of 
global warming. If global greenhouse gas 
neutrality can be achieved in this way by 
2050 and global warming can thereby be 
limited to 1.5°C, the GDP losses expected as 
a result of the gradual rise in temperature 
could be limited to 0.6% in 2100 instead of 
2.7%. Even if global warming can only be 
capped at just under 2°C, climate- related 
GDP losses in Germany will still be signifi  -
cantly lower at 0.8%. If only those national  
contributions to climate protection pledged 
at present are implemented, the average 
temperature is likely to rise by about 2.5°C 
and GDP losses will be perceptibly greater, 
estimated at 1.6%. These scenarios assume 
that the measures implemented do not give 
rise to considerable GDP losses.9 GDP losses 
would be larger if measures to reduce emis-
sions are implemented late or abruptly, or 
are poorly coordinated. Although the costs 
would then be incurred at a later point in 
time, they would be higher overall. From a 
macroeconomic perspective, these results 
indicate that the best option is to take de-
cisive steps to implement climate policy ac-
tion at an early stage.
7 Even if this approach is coupled with the NiGEM 
model, the country- specifi  c NGFS scenarios do not fac-
tor in the additional spillover effects via international 
trade.
8 According to the calculation by Burke et al. (2015), 
whose estimation equation is based on a similar speci-
fi  cation to that on pp. 39 ff., global GDP losses in 2100 
amount to 23%.
9 The assumption that at least some of the tax revenue 
from carbon pricing is used to fi  nance productive in-
vestment plays a major role here (see Etzel et al. 
(2021)). The information for more stringent climate 
protection measures refers to the NGFS’ “Net Zero 
2050” and “Below 2°C” scenarios. The information 
pertaining to national contributions to climate protec-
tion pledged at present refers to the “Nationally Deter-
mined Contributions” scenario.GDP level effects of the gradual rise in

ments. On the other hand, weather extremes 
could act as an indirect stimulus to aggregate 
growth, by encouraging innovation and the 
use of more productive substitute capital. In 
keeping with this, the empirical evidence on 
the long- term macroeconomic implications of 
extreme weather events also paints a mixed 
picture. While there are indications of macro -
economic effects of a negligible or even stimu -
lating nature, there are also a host of studies 
pointing towards longer lasting negative pres -
sures.59
The macroeconomic significance of weather 
extremes is also dependent on how vulnerable 
a particular country is. Geographical location is 
a central factor. For instance, in the past the 
concentration of extreme weather events in 
the Asia- Pacific region was many times higher 
than that in western Europe.60 Besides geog -
raphy, a country’s vulnerability is further influ -
enced by demographics, agglomeration pat -
terns and other socioeconomic factors.61 The 
structure of the economy is also likely to play a 
significant role, for example on account of the 
economic relevance of sectors that are particu -
larly vulnerable to extreme weather, such as 
agriculture.
It follows that estimates for the macroeco -
nomic damage caused by weather extremes 
are different for different regions of the world.62 
So far, economic damage in Asia has been 
many times higher than that seen on the con -
tinent of Europe.63 There have also been differ -
ences throughout Europe, however. Relative to 
respective GDP , the cumulative economic dam -
age of the last 40 years was significantly lower 
in Estonia and Finland and considerably higher 
in Greece, Spain and Italy than in the rest of 
the euro area. That said, the measured losses 
were far lower even in the worst- hit euro area 
countries than in other parts of the world.64
From a monetary policy perspective, the pri -
mary question when it comes to shocks such as 
the occurrence of extreme weather events is 
whether and to what extent the associated dis -ruptions to supply and demand widen or nar -
row the output gap in the short and medium 
term and increase or reduce inflationary pres -

nomic losses to date, it appears that weather 
extremes are of at least no crucial significance 
for monetary policy in the euro area.66
That said, the significance of weather extremes 
for monetary policy in the euro area could 
grow.67 There has already been a considerable 
increase in the frequency of extreme weather 
events in Europe in recent decades. It is also 
conceivable that the rise in weather events of 
macroeconomic significance in other parts of 
the world will lead to increasing spillover effects  
for Europe in future. Furthermore, the mount -
ing incidence of weather extremes could lead 
to abrupt adjustments in climate policy and 
thereby to unexpected changes with a bearing 
on the economy as a whole.68
In addition, the increased frequency of weather 
extremes is likely to make macroeconomic an -
alysis harder for central banks. This applies 
both to the identification of relevant economic 
drivers and the preparation of projections, for 
instance due to the uncertainty surrounding 
the horizon over which extreme weather events 
will exert an effect. Moreover, the established 
analytical tools may not adequately capture the 
transmission mechanisms of weather- related 
disturbances. For example, using a DSGE 
model, it can be shown that the magnitude of 
the consumer price response following a 
weather- induced supply- side shock is heavily 
dependent on the assumed sectoral structure.69

Macroeconomic impact of 
climate policy
It is not just climate change itself but also the 
measures introduced with a view to mitigating 
it that are likely to have a significant macroeco -
nomic impact. In December 2015, 196 coun -
tries adopted the Paris Agreement, setting the 
minimum goal of limiting the increase in the 
global average temperature to well below 2°C 
compared to pre- industrial levels.71 Global 
greenhouse gas emissions need to be signifi -
cantly reduced over the coming years if these 
goals are to be achieved.72 With this in mind, 
various measures are being considered. These 
include a sometimes substantial increase in the 
cost of greenhouse gas emissions, for example, 
by introducing emissions taxes or an emissions 
trading scheme, setting emissions caps or even 
completely banning certain emissions- intensive 
economic activities or products.
The transition to a less carbon- intensive econ -
omy may give rise to considerable supply-  side 
strains.73 These include direct costs as a result 
of emissions pricing but also increased prices 
for emissions- intensive intermediate inputs, 
outlay to avoid emissions or expenses incurred 
in aligning production with new policies, and 
losses due to asset repricing.74 The economic 
ramifications for firms are likely to depend on 
the type and nature of interventions as well as 
the characteristics of the particular economic 
sector they belong to. This includes the specific 
emissions and energy intensity as well as the 
respective market position, the latter being a 
pivotal factor governing the extent to which 
costs can be passed on, for example.75 How -
ever, climate policy initiatives may also be de -
signed with a view to incentivising green innov -
ation by firms. This can foster technological ad -
vances that boost productivity.76Objectives

70 The extreme weather event is modelled as a temporary 
negative supply- side shock, the strength of which is speci -
fied such that when the shock occurs value added falls by 
0.015% in the first quarter (i.e. 0.06% on an annual basis) 
in both model versions. This calibration is based on the esti -
mates of Dafermos et al. (2020).
71 Ideally, global warming should be limited to 1.5°C as 
this would significantly reduce the risks associated with cli -
mate change compared with a 2°C scenario. See United 
Nations (2015).
72 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
describes various scenarios compatible with meeting the 
goals agreed upon in Paris 2015. In a core scenario, achiev -
ing the 1.5°C goal would require global net CO₂ emissions 
to be cut by 45% compared to 2010 levels by 2030 and 
brought to zero by 2050. The 2°C goal would require a 
25% reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2070. See Inter -
governmental Panel on Climate Change (2018).
73 See also Batten (2018) and Andersson et al. (2020).
74 There is a risk of regulatory intervention leading to the 
sudden or gradual devaluation of a firm’s capital (“stranded 
assets”). This might happen if the firm is no longer permit -
ted to use that capital in production or if production pro -
cesses cease to be economically viable due to increased 
emissions prices, for example. See also Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2021a, 2021b) and the article on pp. 63 ff.

Climate policy measures are also likely to have 
an impact on the demand side. Higher energy 
costs due to emissions pricing will squeeze the 
budgets of households and firms. This will tend 
to dampen consumption and investment, 
which in turn may affect wages and employ -
ment, bringing corresponding consequences 
for aggregate demand.77 Individual households 
and firms may be affected to very different de -
grees, which would then have a bearing on 
macroeconomic developments.78 On the other 
hand, demand- stimulating effects could stem 
from investment incentives, the distribution to 
households of revenue from emissions pricing 
or from additional public investment.
The predictability of climate policy is likely to be 
highly relevant when it comes to macroeco -
nomic effects. This is because uncertainty 
weighs on the consumption and investment 
decisions of households and firms. Develop -
ments that come as a surprise can also trigger 
extensive revaluations of financial assets, with corresponding consequences for financial sta -
bility.79
The overall result is a complex layering of sup -
ply and demand- side effects whose macroeco -
nomic net impact is not always clear up front.80 Impact on

Depending on how it is designed, climate pol -
icy may, in the short to medium term, go hand 
in hand with either a shrinking or a growing 
output gap and commensurately lower or 
higher inflationary pressures. Taken by itself, 
decisive action to mitigate climate change 
would probably have an initial dampening ef -
fect on aggregate growth, but climate- related 
damage would be reduced in the longer term. 
The medium- term impact on economic growth 
also hinges on the design of climate policy and 
its predictability.81
It is likely that a tighter carbon pricing regime 
would at least temporarily lead to higher infla -
tion. The magnitude of the effect depends pri -
marily on the timing of the climate policy meas -
ures, as shown, for example, by macroeco -
nomic climate model projections performed as 
part of work by the Network of Central Banks 
and Supervisors for Greening the Financial Sys -
tem (NGFS). The carbon price pathway of an 
orderly transition where the degree of climate 
policy intervention is gradually increased ex -
hibits considerable differences from the carbon 
price pathway under a disorderly climate policy, 
where it is assumed that intervention comes 
much later but is then all the more stringent.82
It must be borne in mind that the burden of 
climate  policy measures varies from one eco -
nomic sector to the next, a fact that can be 
illus trated by simulations using the environ -

sumer price inflation would sit approximately 1 percentage

On the role of sectoral linkages when analysing transition 
risks: the environmental multi- sector DSGE model EMuSe
Climate action may hit certain economic 
sectors especially hard,1 which could have 
far- reaching consequences for fi  nancial sta-
bility, monetary policy transmission and ag-
gregate growth. This is why it is important 
to keep an eye on sectoral developments 
and their macroeconomic implications 
when analysing climate action. Given the 
high level of aggregation of economic sec-
tors in prototypical dynamic macroeco-
nomic models, this is either not possible or 
possible to  only a limited extent. Mean-
while, traditional multi- sector models are 
generally static and focus on long- term 
equilibria. They are not suitable for analys-
ing key adjustment processes. The Bundes-
bank therefore developed a dynamic sto-
chastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model 
with a multi- sector production structure.2 This model contains both key economic and 
ecological variables such as CO₂ emissions. 
In addition, it can analyse international link-
ages between up to three countries or re-
gions. This allows the model, named EMuSe 
(Environmental Multi- Sector),3 to be adapted 
fl  exibly to various policy questions.4
The EMuSe model allows for a relatively de-
tailed examination of the interrelationship 
between the economy and climate policy. 
Particularly signifi  cant in this regard is the 
fact that, in the EMuSe model, enterprises 
use not only capital and labour but also 
intermediate inputs to produce output. 
These can come from any sector, although 
the extent to which various inputs are sub-
stitutable is limited. The composition of the 
intermediate input bundles varies depend-
ing on the sector.
The role played by intersectoral linkages can 
be illustrated by comparing the simulation 
results for the multi- sector model with a 
version without a sectoral breakdown or 
the corresponding linkages.5 The impact of 
carbon pricing on aggregate growth and 
CO₂ emissions for the European Union and 
the United Kingdom is analysed here as an 
1 See also the remarks on this topic on p. 49.
2 A typical feature of this model class is the way it 
seeks to explain relationships and developments based 
on the individual optimal decisions of (typically) ra-
tional economic agents. For a detailed explanation of 
this model framework, see, inter alia, Christiano et al. 
(2018).
3 A detailed description of the EMuSe model can be 
found in Hinterlang et al. (2021).
4 Both fl  exible prices and price rigidities can be as-
sumed, for example.
5 Both models are parametrised to depict the Euro-
pean Union along with the United Kingdom. The ag-
gregate emissions level and aggregate economic activ-
ity are identical at the start of the simulation in both 
versions of the model. The production structure of the 
multi- sector model comprises ten sectors.Projections of annual carbon prices and

example. For the purposes of simplifi  cation, 
external trade links are excluded and the 
European Union and the United Kingdom 
are depicted together as one region. The 
assumed trajectory for the carbon price is 
based on the projections made by the Net-
work of Central Banks and Supervisors for 
Greening the Financial System (NGFS) for an 
orderly climate policy transition. In these 
projections, climate policy’s level of inter-
vention is assumed to increase steadily up 
to the middle of the century with the aim of 
limiting the rise in the global average tem-
perature to 1.5°C above pre- industrial 
levels.6 From 2020 onwards, in particular, 
the carbon price rises sharply.
The costs arising from carbon pricing for 
enterprises within a sector depend on the 
carbon price, the sector- specifi  c CO₂ emis-
sions intensity and output level. The analysis 
assumes that the trajectory of the emissions 
price and the sectoral emissions intensity 
given for the simulation period from 2005 
to 2100 is known to all agents in the 
model.7 Changes in the emissions intensity 
over time can be understood here as an ap-
proximation of the impact of exogenous 
environmentally friendly technological pro-
gress.8 In the multi- sector version of the 
model, it is assumed, for simplicity, that the 
emissions intensity will change to the same 
extent across all sectors.
Although the development of CO₂ emis-
sions is very similar in both model versions 
under these assumptions, there are signifi  -
cant differences in terms of aggregate growth. 
This is due to the shifts in the production 
structure triggered by climate action and 
the consequential effects of these shifts, 
which are disregarded in the single- sector 
version. The possibilities of substituting 
goods in individual sectors with the prod-
ucts of other economic sectors in the pro-
duction process, as well as complementar-ities, play a pivotal role. The energy sector, 
for instance, is particularly affected by car-
bon pricing, which means that the price of 
energy will rise faster than many other 
prices. However, there are limits to the ex-
tent that energy can be substituted with 
other goods as there are complementarities 
between energy and other intermediate 
goods. This is why demand for all types of 
intermediate inputs drops following a 
strong rise in energy prices, and output is 
scaled back.
6 The NGFS’s carbon price and CO₂ emissions intensity 
projections were generated using the REMIND- MAgPIE 
model developed by the Potsdam Institute for Climate 
Impact Research. See Network of Central Banks and 
Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (2020).
7 The trajectory of the emissions intensity is also taken 
from the NGFS’s projections. The changes in the car-
bon price and sectoral emissions intensities thus enter 
EMuSe exogenously. By contrast, the aggregate emis-
sions intensity (the ratio of aggregate emissions to ag-
gregate economic activity) is endogenous.

a disorderly transition, it becomes apparent 
that risk concentrations develop in specific eco -
nomic sectors. This can contribute to the build- 
up of systemic risk in the financial system, 
which could jeopardise financial stability and 
thus the fulfilment of the monetary policy man -
date.83
It is also probable that climate policy will bring 
about lasting structural changes, with some 
economic sectors gaining in importance and 
others losing ground. This could have repercus -
sions for economic growth and price develop -
ments as well as indirect ramifications for mon -
etary policy transmission. The extent to which 
this will be the case is contingent on sector-  
specific characteristics such as emissions and 
energy intensity or how sensitive demand is to 
changes in price. The degree of friction in prod -
uct and financial markets is also likely to play a 
role. Analytical tools such as the EMuSe model 
can supply helpful insights here.How intense the effects of a harmonised cli -
mate policy are can also differ on a regional 
basis. For example, a decomposition of per 
capita CO₂ emissions in the European Union 
(EU) reveals significant differences between 
Member States with respect to the energy in -
tensity of gross domestic product (GDP) and 
the CO₂ emissions intensity of energy produc -
tion.84 For instance, the average energy inten - … and some -

ences in impact 
of climate policyAccording to the simulation, in the multi- 
sector version, it was possible to make use 
of the relief provided by the scope for sub-
stitution when carbon prices were still low 
initially. From around 2020 onwards, how-
ever, complementarities weighing down on 
the economy dominate on account of the 
considerable rise in the carbon price.9
The simulation results show that taking into 
account the sectoral linkages of an econ-
omy can be important not only to structural 
analysis and considerations of fi  nancial sta-
bility, but also to macroeconomic analysis.10 
This is especially true for larger sectoral 
shocks, such as the occurrence of physical 
climate risks or unexpected climate action.9 Although the level of detail is relatively high, the ver-
sion of EMuSe used here has been simplifi  ed, in some 
ways considerably. Simplifi  cations include the assump-
tion of homogeneous household preferences that re-
main constant over time, the omission of endogenous 
technological progress and the assumption of a closed 
economy. The results should therefore be interpreted 
with caution.
10 See also Baqaee and Farhi (2020).
83 See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b).
84 In formal terms, the decomposition is expressed as 
CO2i/~POPi = GDPi/~POPi * Energyi/~GDPi * CO2i/~Energyi, 
where ~Xi = Xi/XEU is the ratio of a factor in country i to 
the average for the EU. The decomposition makes it pos -
sible to break the annual per capita CO₂ emissions (CO2i/
POPi) in the EU Member States down into different deter -
minants. These include overall output, measured as per 
capita GDP (GDPi/POPi), the energy intensity of GDP 
(Energyi/GDPi), given by the ratio of primary energy con -
sumption to GDP , as well as the CO₂ emissions intensity of 
energy consumption (CO2i/Energyi), which represents 
the ratio of CO₂ emissions to primary energy consumption. 
Primary energy consumption is gross domestic energy con -
sumption excluding energy carriers used for non- energy 
purposes; the CO₂ emissions are those resulting from the 
use of energy. In the interests of comparability, the factors 
are normalised by placing them in relation to the EU- wide 
average. See also Kaya and Yokobori (1997).Deutsche Bundesbank

sity of GDP is much higher in the central and 
eastern EU Member States than in the rest of 
the EU.
It is not just domestic climate policy that is ex -
pected to exert a considerable influence on 
macroeconomic developments; climate policy 
abroad is also likely to be highly influential. For 
example, unilateral climate policy measures 
could lead to goods with high emissions and 
energy intensity profiles increasingly being 
sourced from overseas. The sector mix at home 
and abroad would alter, affecting macroeco -
nomic developments and the efficiency of cli -
mate policy measures. This is also borne out by 
EMuSe simulations specifying a carbon pricing 
regime for the EU while the rest of the world 
takes no climate policy action. As a result, the 
share of value added accounted for by the EU 
manufacturing sector would drop distinctly, 
partly because of the sector’s emissions-  
intensive products being increasingly sourced 
from other countries. Emissions would there -
fore be shifted abroad. Possibilities for counter -
acting this include a countervailing charge in 
the form of a climate tariff or alternatively the 
development and application of new, greener 
technologies that boost carbon productivity at 
home.85
Climate policy measures can therefore have sig -
nificant macroeconomic effects, the specifics of 
which will hinge on their precise design, the 
economy’s capacity to adapt and the external 
setting. Central banks need to pay heed to all 
of this when conducting their analyses. This re -
quires the right kind of data and the right kind 
of analytical tools.86
Outlook
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy is geared to -
wards safeguarding price stability and helping 
to ensure a stable financial system. To achieve 
these goals, it is important to adequately assess 
short and long- term economic developments. 
Global climate change and climate action pose new challenges in this context. It is therefore 
necessary to review and, where required, ad -
just the analytical toolkit available to monetary 
policymakers. This is also true of macroeco -
nomic analysis, which is key to monetary policy 
decision- making. Alongside the impact of ex -
treme weather events and gradually rising tem -
peratures, it is notably the macroeconomic re -
percussions of climate policy that are likely to 
become significant in the near future. Climate 
policy measures may trigger far- reaching struc -
tural adjustment processes that also transcend 
national borders; if their macroeconomic impli -
cations are to be adequately gauged, models 
with sufficient regional and sectoral differenti -
ation are needed. This article presents EMuSe,

Climate and economic policy can play a vital 
part in mitigating risks and uncertainties, par -
ticularly through long- term focus, consistency 
and efficiency. But the reduction of structural 
rigidities could likewise help smooth the transi -

Scenario- based equity valuation effects 
induced by greenhouse gas emissions
Corporate valuations are largely determined by investors’ and market participants’ expectations. 
These encompass expectations about the future trajectory of CO₂ prices just as much as expect -
ations about how sharply a company can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by adjusting tech -
nology in response to rising emissions costs. Where expectations shift from a scenario in which 
Nationally Determined Contributions are implemented to a scenario aligned with the more ambi -
tious Paris Climate Agreement targets, this could involve, in some cases, considerable valuation 
changes. In particular, it is then likely that companies will be revalued along the lines of their car -
bon footprint and their ability to bear the associated costs.
The present article introduces a simple indicator which quantifies the emissions- related changes 
in the valuation of stock corporations resulting from a shift from one scenario to another. Here, 
a multi- stage dividend discount model is calibrated on firm- specific greenhouse gas emissions 
and scenario data from a multi- regional integrated assessment model (IAM). The IAM used here 
models in a detailed fashion the energy systems in the individual regions of the world, amongst 
other things, and allows for temporary regional differences in climate policy. Under a set of 
assumptions, the measure presented in this article provides a risk indication for the firm’s ability 
to bear scenario- dependent costs of direct greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, the results 
for 5,285 stock corporations from various countries indicate that a large percentage of them 
would sustain only minor emissions- related valuation losses as a result of a shift in expectations 
towards a transition to a Paris- aligned low- carbon economy. On the other hand, a segment of 
companies with high emissions costs and limited ability to bear these costs would suffer substan -
tial valuation losses – especially in business areas oriented to fossil fuels. Climate- related valu -
ation changes and the question of climate- related stranding of certain assets are therefore likely 
to play an important role in financial markets going forward.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The atmospheric concentration of carbon diox -
ide (CO₂) has gone up by over 25% in the past 
50 years. At the same time, an increase in the 
global average temperature has been observed. 
There is now a consensus in the scientific com -
munity that the increasing concentration of 
CO₂ in the atmosphere is attributable to human 
actions and that there is a causal relationship 
between the CO₂ concentration and the rise in 
temperatures. A large number of recognised 
climate models therefore look at scenarios of 
future emissions of CO₂ and other greenhouse 
gases. At the heart of these scenarios is to 
identify which emissions pathways are associ -
ated with which climate impacts and tempera -
ture increases.1
Consistent with mounting signs of climate 
change, this scientific consensus is increasingly 
spilling over to the societal and political de -
bates. It is widely agreed that greenhouse gas 
emissions need to be reduced in order to miti -
gate global warming. The outcomes of this 
consensus have been, in particular, the Paris 
Climate Agreement (COP21) and, most recently, 
the UN Climate Change Conference in Glas -
gow (COP26) and national climate action legis -
lation.
The corporate sector is one of the largest emit -
ters of greenhouse gases. Policy interventions 
aimed at reducing emissions will therefore also 
impact strongly on firms. The analysis pre -
sented here quantifies the impact of climate 
policy measures – here, in the form of long-term 
CO₂ price paths – on corporate valuation. The 
article will focus on the emissions- related stock 
market valuation effects that can be associated 
with a structural transition towards less carbon- 
intensive production. If, for example, climate 
policy is aligned with the Paris climate targets, 
leading to a transition to a low- carbon econ -
omy, the results presented here suggest that 
the valuations of a large proportion of com -
panies will see only little change. For a segment 
of the firms, however, considerable shifts will occur, and some firms will see elevated insolv -
ency risk (stranded assets).2 The indicator pro -
posed in this analysis has been kept simple by 
design. It factors out the firm-  specific costs of 
avoiding emissions. The effects of progressive 
physical climate change, such as damage 
caused by extreme weather events, are not 
taken into consideration, either.
A key policy lever is the CO₂ emissions price, 
which is also applicable to other greenhouse 
gas emissions (expressed as CO₂ equivalents). 
This is likely to be the element on which 
climate-  friendly structural change will hinge.3 
At the same time, the CO₂ price path deter -
mines the speed at which the relative prices of 
carbon- intensive products and services shift. 
The shift in relative prices therefore sets incen -
tives to reconfigure business models and pro -
duction processes and adapt supply chains. In 
this context, it is pivotal to head for a use of 
low- carbon energy sources. In the multi-  
regional climate- economic model applied here, 
too, the CO₂ price plays a key role.
Climate- economic models 
and climate scenarios used
Recourse is often taken to what are known as 
multi- regional integrated assessment models 
(IAMs), which incorporate the climate system, 
the economy and the energy and land- use sys -
tems. They allow scenarios for the climate sys -
tem to be modelled as a function of climate 
policy and economic structures – especially re -
garding the use of fossil and non- fossil energy 
sources. Drivers here are the various emitters of 
CO₂ and other greenhouse gases and their 
emissions trajectories. Such scenarios serve as 
key pillars of climate policy decisions. It is not 
sufficient to analyse historical data in order to Climate change

adequately assess future climate risks: there are 
no historical precedents for either climate 
change caused by the burning of fossil fuels or 
efforts to transition from carbon- intensive to 
low- carbon economies.
In order to calculate policy- relevant climate-  
economic scenarios, climate research institutes 
generally use process- based IAMs which allow 
for differences in regional developments and 
which exactly model key sectors. The projec -
tions of these models can be used, inter alia, as 
inputs for central banks’ economic models. 
Harmonised scenarios from such models also 
form, for instance, the analytical basis for the 
work carried out within the Network for Green -
ing the Financial System (NGFS), a global net -
work of central banks and supervisory author -
ities.4 The baseline scenario in the relevant 
scenarios is usually the “business as usual” 
case, characterised by the complete absence of 
enhanced climate policy efforts. An alternative, 
somewhat more optimistic baseline scenario of 
the models consists in full implementation of 
“Nationally Determined Contributions” by pol -
icymakers.5
Scenarios calibrated in this manner come to the 
conclusion that the international community’s 
current Nationally Determined Contributions 
will not suffice to achieve the Paris Climate 
Agreement targets.6
This became clear at the COP26 climate confer -
ence in November 2021. It therefore cannot be 
ruled out that future governments will agree to 
take more ambitious climate action measures. 
Therefore, in scenario analyses, the aforemen -
tioned more optimistic baseline “Nationally De -
termined Contributions” scenario is frequently 
contrasted with a climate policy scenario in 
which emissions of CO₂ and other greenhouse 
gases are priced such that they are reduced 
considerably in keeping with the Paris Agree -
ment. One of these scenarios is “Net Zero 
2050”. Under this scenario, societies around 
the world begin today to reconfigure their 
economies to low- carbon economies in an or -derly manner such that, by 2050, net CO₂ 
emissions are down to zero.
In the IAMs, representative agents maximise 
their utility while complying with restrictions on 
cumulative emissions of CO₂ and other green -
house gases. In the “Net Zero 2050” scenario, 
their scope is compatible with the 1.5°C tem -
perature target. Regional greenhouse gas emis -
sions are an endogenous result of this maxi -
misation. It is thus implicitly assumed that, in 
their production plans, companies choose their 
energy mix to minimise energy costs – depend -
ing on the regional availability of resources.7,8
The size of the differences between such scen -
arios is illustrated, in the chart on p. 66, in the 
time pathways for the CO₂ price and green -
house gas emissions from a typical simulation 
of one of the IAMs used in the NGFS. To wit, in 
the “Net Zero 2050” scenario the global aver -
age CO₂ price already surges between 2020 
and 2025, while it hovers near zero in the re -

scenario they drop quickly after 2020. Within 
this Paris- aligned scenario, as in all scenarios 
used in the NGFS, regionally different CO₂

7 In this scenario, there will continue to be a small amount 
of global CO₂ emissions after 2050, but these will be offset 
by CO₂ withdrawals elsewhere. Cost- minimising behaviour 
which also allows for regional differences in CO₂ pricing is 
a property of the category of “cost- effectiveness models”. 
See, for example, Luderer et al. (2015) and Glanemann et 
al. (2020).
8 To achieve this temperature target, the trajectory of CO₂ 
prices is used as a conduit to determine cost- effective path -
ways of the prices of energy sources and greenhouse gas 
emissions. See Kriegler et al. (2013), Lontzek et al. (2015),

We will refer below to projections for the base -
line “Nationally Determined Contributions” 
scenario and a Paris- aligned “Net Zero 2050” 
climate scenario in the REMIND9 model de -
veloped by the Potsdam Institute for Climate 
Impact Research. As in other internationally ac -
claimed and renowned models of this category 
of IAMs, this model is basically about project -
ing a large number of economic, energy-  
related, physical and climate- relevant indicators 
over long periods of time – generally until the 
end of the 21st century. On the basis of these 
model projections, we will investigate what 
valuation effects can occur in financial markets 
if the climate policy expectations “flip over” 
from this baseline to the “Net Zero 2050” cli -
mate scenario.
The REMIND model is a global general equilib -
rium growth model. This closed- economy model with twelve regions consists of a macro -
economic core and process-  based modellings 
of the energy sector with all relevant green -
house gas emissions.10 Here, the energy mod -
ule is connected to the macroeconomic core 
via energy demand and energy costs. Endogen -
ous technological change all the way to 
climate- friendly energy production is allowed 
for via a  global learning curve. The REMIND 
model can be linked up to a land- use model 
called MAgPIE.11
It is assumed in the “Net Zero 2050” scenario 
that the individual regions of the world begin 
to coordinate their climate policy approaches in 
the 2020 to 2025 period, with most regions ini -
tially starting out with CO₂ prices at different 
levels that gradually converge (by 2050) to a 
common trajectory. The REMIND- MAgPIE 
model allows an aggregated good, fossil fuels 
and bioenergy to be tradable across regions. 
Adequate mechanisms – such as carbon border 
adjustment mechanisms – permit regional dif -
ferences in CO₂ prices charged without this 
leading to shifts in trade relationships. CO₂ 
price- induced competitive distortion or shifting 
of emissions to third countries – referred to as 
carbon leakage – can therefore be ruled out for 
energy- intensive goods.12 There is therefore no 
contradiction between differences in CO₂ 
prices and coordination of regional climate pol -
icies: given that considerable transfers would 
be necessary in order to achieve the decarbon -
isation at the same CO₂ prices, initial price dif -In the spotlight:

10 The climate system, including temperature estimation, is 
not modelled within the REMIND model but in a coupled 
model. The MAGICC 6 model is used here for NGFS scen -
arios; see Meinshausen et al. (2011).
11 See Dietrich et al. (2019). Land- use models such as 
MAgPIE combine economic and biophysical approaches in 
order to simulate spatially explicit global land- use scenarios 
(especially pasture, forest and cropland for food and bio -
energy purposes) in the 21st century as well as interactions 
with the environment. In order to identify common transi -
tion pathways from energy and land- use systems in con -
nection with the macroeconomic core, the REMIND model 
is therefore coupled either with land- use emulators or, in 
an iterative process, with the stand- alone MAgPIE land- use 
model.

ferentiation and gradual convergence are toler -
ated.13
On the basis of the REMIND- MAgPIE model, 
the chart on p. 68 illustrates the relationship 
between global greenhouse gas emissions and 
global GDP (at 2010 prices) for selected climate 
policy scenarios. It turns out that in a baseline 
scenario in which climate policy efforts remain 
unchanged globally (“business as usual”), there 
is virtually no reduction in emissions despite a 
certain decline in emissions intensity, which im -
plies that global warming is not mitigated (me -
dian rise of 3.1°C by the year 2100).14
In the alternative baseline scenario, in which it 
is assumed that the Nationally Determined 
Contributions pledged by end- 2020 are fully 
implemented, the reduction in emissions inten -
sity – the amount of greenhouse gas emissions 
over GDP – is stronger, which means that emis -
sions will decline to a certain extent in absolute 
terms beginning in 2030 (implying median global warming of 2.4°C by the year 2100). 
Both baseline scenarios can be compared with 
an ambitious global climate policy aligned with 
the Paris Climate Agreement targets: as the 
chart on p.  68 shows, a strong reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions and thus in emis -
sions intensity will be necessary to limit median 
global warming to 1.5°C. In a “Net Zero 2050” 
scenario, CO₂ prices already go up so sharply in 
the coming years that greenhouse gas emis -
sions will decline in the current decade from 
700g to 290g of CO₂ equivalents per real US 
dollar of GDP and keep falling to 130g by 
2040. Whereas historical reductions in intensity 
were primarily based on improved energy effi -
ciency, such a rapid reduction is possible only if 
energy supply is changed over to climate-  
friendly technologies – mainly based on renew -
able energy sources.Considerable

The scenario of Nationally Determined Contri -
butions shall serve as the baseline scenario 
below – thereby assuming that it is an accurate 
reflection of current market expectations.15 This 
is against the background of existing empirical 
evidence which indicates that greenhouse gas 
emissions influence companies’ financial mar -
ket prices to a certain extent. However, there 
are no signs to date that corporate valuations 
are broadly consistent with a Paris- aligned tran -
sition scenario.
Climate risks and stranded 
assets
“Stranded assets” are currently being increas -
ingly discussed as a possible by- product of cli -
mate change. An asset is said to be stranded 
prior to the end of its useful economic life – as 
expected at the time of investment  – if this 
asset can no longer yield any economic return 
and thus loses its entire value. In the context of climate change, losses in value can be caused 
by physical damage, regulatory intervention or 
structural change. Value losses can occur – po -
tentially abruptly – if already- made investments 
are rendered unprofitable by unexpected policy 
measures or extreme weather events.
With regard to “green” structural change or 
the transition to a low- carbon economy – much 
in the spirit of “creative destruction” – it may, 
however, be necessary to strand certain busi -
ness models if the goal is the efficient use of 
funds for necessary investment in financial mar -
kets.
There is a wide body of literature which studies 
the potential losses of asset values caused by 
climate change. Meinshausen et al. (2009) dis -
cuss the “stranded assets” hypothesis by show -
ing the limited amount of CO₂ that could be 
emitted by 2050 in order to have a high prob -
ability of keeping global warming below 2°C by 
2100. The logical consequence of these calcu -
lations is that a substantial portion of existing 
fossil fuel inventories would have to remain in 
the ground (“unburnable carbon”). McGlade 
and Ekins (2015) show that, between 2010 and 
2050, one- third of oil reserves, one- half of gas 
reserves and over 80% of coal reserves would 
have to go unextracted in order to meet the 
two- degree goal. In order to have a 50% 
chance of not exceeding a temperature in -
crease of 1.5°C, according to Welsby et al. 
(2021), even nearly 60% of oil and gas reserves 
and 90% of coal reserves would have to re -
main in the ground.16 This would render a sub -
stantial proportion of fossil fuel assets worth -
less.Nationally

Methodological approach to 
quantifying emissions- related 
changes in value and poten -
tially stranding assets
Various approaches to quantifying climate-  
related changes in asset values have been 
proposed   in the literature. One of these con -
sists in incorporating projections of the afore -
mentioned macroeconomic climate scenarios 
into a large macroeconometric model such as 
NiGEM17 and, in a first step, identifying country 
effects for economic output and equity prices 
within a given transition scenario.18 In a second 
step, the resulting trajectories are linked to the 
results of a sector model in order to assign 
valuation effects resulting from a switch from a 
baseline scenario to a more ambitious transi -
tion scenario to individual securities depending 
on the sector of the issuer.
Battiston et al. (2017) and Roncoroni et al. 
(2021) take another path. They examine risk ex -
posure in institutional portfolios and, on this 
basis, answer the question as to how climate 
policy risks might propagate through the finan -
cial system, using their own sector classification 
(referred to as “Climate Policy Relevant Sec -
tors”).19 As regards equity valuation, Battiston 
et al. (2021) suggest estimating a firm’s divi -
dend path in proportion to output. They in turn 
then model future output as a function of the 
observed climate scenario. The authors use the 
comparison between this pathway and the 
baseline scenario pathway to identify firm- level 
changes in value.
We propose an alternative, innovative firm-  
level approach. As described above, climate-  
economic scenarios can be used to model the 
pathways to achieving the Paris Climate Agree -
ment targets. Against this background, we de -
velop a scenario-  based price impact indicator 
based on the costs of direct greenhouse gas 
emissions attributable to non- financial corpor -
ations and then relate these to individual firms’ 
dividend expectations. This indicator also in -
corporates projected macroeconomic output in the individual regions of the world and the use 
of individual fossil and non-  fossil energy 
sources. The objective is to quantify the finan -
cial market implications of Paris- aligned climate 
action by taking recourse to projections in 
IAMs.

based price impact indicator
Dividend discount model as a 
starting point
As a rule, market participants’ expectations 
about the climate policy pathways followed by 
the international community and companies’ 
adaptability determine whether market valu -
ations and financing conditions discriminate 
adequately between low- emissions and 
emissions- intensive business models.20 Against 
this backdrop, the analysis described here starts 
by quantifying, in a first approximation, the 
corporate valuation effects as a result of an as -
sumed switch from an expected implementa -
tion of “Nationally Determined Contributions” 
to the Paris- aligned “Net Zero 2020” scenario. 
Meanwhile, any imponderables in terms of the 
evolution of global CO₂ prices and the con -
comitant uncertainties this creates in financial 
markets are disregarded here.21

An emissions- related price impact indicator
A multi- stage dividend discount model 
–  which allows for the incorporation of 
scenario- speciﬁ  c projections – was chosen 
as a basis for the construction of an 
emissions- related price impact indicator. 
The relationship between the share price 
Vi,r,s,2020  of company i  at the base date 
(here: December 2020) and the future divi-
dends Di,r,s,τ in the baseline scenario (here: 
“Nationally Determined Contributions”) is 
shown in equation (1). Here, it is assumed 
that the baseline scenario is the scenario ex-
pected at the end of 2020 in the markets 
for company i  domiciled in region r  and 
whose core business is in sector s:

described by the variables DIBES

Dtransition base
i,r,s,⌧  and Dbase
i,r,s,⌧ . The unknown 
variable for which this equation can be 
solved is the implied cost of equity (return

rate. For the ﬁ  rst three years (2021 to 2023), 
dividend expectations DIBES
i,⌧  drawn from 
analyst surveys (sources: IBES, Thomson 
Reuters) are introduced, which are assumed 
to be already priced in. For the following 
year (2024) the dividend expectation is 
approxi mated using the three to ﬁ  ve- year 
IBES earnings growth expectation – which 
does not depend on the chosen scenario, 
either.1 In the following assumed eight- year 
transition period (2025 to 2032), the com-
pany’s dividends Dtransition base
i,r,s,⌧  are pro-jected based on an interpolation between 
the three to ﬁ  ve- year IBES earnings growth 
expectations and the scenario- dependent, 
partly sector- speciﬁ  c economic output in 
the twelfth year (plus an inﬂ  ation assump-
tion).
In contrast to the three- stage dividend dis-
count model,2 no “steady state” dividend 
growth is assumed in the subsequent phase 
(2033 to 2100). Instead, the model assumes 
a trajectory of dividends Dbase
i,r,s,⌧  propor-
tional to economic output in the climate 
scenario under review up to the year 2100, 
plus an inﬂ  ation assumption. Here, eco-
nomic output refers either to nominal gross 
domestic product (GDP) or sectoral produc-
tion in the baseline scenario for the region 
in which the company is domiciled. If the 
company is an oil, gas or coal producer or is 
active in the ﬁ  elds of renewable or nuclear 
energy, its dividends are projected in pro-
portion to the trajectory of energy produc-
tion in the respective sector. If it is a cement 
or steel company, its dividends are pro-
jected in proportion to the trajectory of 
either  cement or steel production, respect-
ively.3
Projections arising from the REMIND- 
MAgPIE model are available up to the year 
2100 and are accordingly incorporated. For 
the following period, it is assumed that divi-
dends continue to grow at the rate last pro-
jected in the baseline scenario for sector s 
and/ or GDP gY,base
r,s,2100  in region r, plus the in-
ﬂ  ation assumption.
1 Should the latter not be available for a company, it is 
approximated by extrapolating the dividend growth 
between years two and three for a further year.

The second step involves projecting fi  rm- 
specifi  c additional costs from greenhouse 
gas emissions that are incremental to the 
baseline scenario. The central focus here is 
the scenario of an orderly transition to a 
Paris- aligned low- carbon economy (“Net 
Zero 2050”). The starting point is direct 
greenhouse gas emissions, expressed in 
CO₂ equivalents. These data are taken from 
company reports or estimated by special-
ised data providers (source used here: ISS- 
ESG). The emissions data per share ci,0 
underlying the analysis are for 2019.
In addition to the size of company emis-
sions per share at time τ (cNZ
i,r,⌧ or cbase
i,r,⌧), 
the CO₂ price in region r  determines the 
emissions costs per share ( CNZ
i,r,⌧ or Cbase

in the Paris- aligned “Net Zero 2050” scen-
ario and the baseline scenario:

Accordingly, the incremental costs per share

tween (2a) and (2b).

To quantify the future scenario- dependent

are projected as a function of the scenario-

According to equation (3), gE,sc

at which greenhouse gas emissions in fu-ture year n increase or decrease. It is deter-
mined using the scenario- specifi  c emissions 
Esc
r,t and Esc
r,t+5, which are available at fi  ve- 
year intervals [ t, t + 5] . The emissions of 
company i change cumulatively between 
the base date and year τ at the rate 
⇧⌧
n=1(1 + gE,sc
r,n)1. It is thereby assumed 
that they evolve in proportion to overall 
emissions in the observed scenario. With re-
spect to the “Net Zero 2050” scenario, this 
is compatible with a Paris- aligned decar-
bonisation.4 If scenario- specifi  c emissions 
are negative – due, for instance, to the use 
of carbon dioxide removal technologies – a 
complete decarbonisation is assumed 
(gE,sc
r,n=1). This means that no earnings 
stemming from negative emissions or lat-
eral transfers are permitted at the company 
level.
Finally, the scenario- dependent dividend 
path of company i is reduced by the share 
xi of the incremental cost from equation 
(2c) that the company cannot pass on to its 
customers by assumption. The valuation 
effect  for a company arising from a revision 
of expectations from the baseline scenario 
towards the “Net Zero 2020” scenario is

horizons. The focus here lies on the change in 
the value of individual firms as a result of the 
switch, outlined above, in market participants’ 
expectations regarding climate policy. The com -
pany’s equity price as at the base date (here: 
end- 2020) is used as its reference value. This is 
assumed to correspond to the present value of 
the future dividend flows if the end- of- 2020 
pledges (Nationally Determined Contributions) 
are implemented. This share price is put in rela -
tion to the company’s equity value if the “Net 
Zero 2050” scenario is implemented. The price 
impact indicator analysed here describes the 
difference between these two figures. Such a 
measure of the difference in value between 
scenarios is likely to be relevant to investors, 
too, when quantifying potential price adjust -
ments for individual companies or the risk of a 
stranding of assets (see also the box on 
pp. 70 ff.).
For this indicator to be calculated for every 
stock corporation, several assumptions must initially be made. It is assumed, for instance, 
that companies are able to substitute energy 
sources in line with the production technology

ately, greenhouse gas emissions can be per -
ceived as the result of a cost- driven energy 
choice made by the representative firm. As CO₂ 
prices rise, firms will tend to replace increas -
ingly expensive emissions-  intensive energy 
sources with lower- emissions alternatives. Put 
simply, companies’ optimisation calculus will be 
to decarbonise as long as the firm- specific cost 
of avoiding the last tonne of carbon emissions 
is lower than the CO₂ price.Scenario- based

22 For the gross domestic product of each region, this 
model assumes a (nested CES) production function with 
constant substitution elasticities, with energy as a factor of 
production consisting of inputs from the buildings, industry 
and transport sectors. These are, in turn, dependent on 
their own elasticities of substitution between individual fos -
sil and non- fossil energy sources.Deutsche Bundesbank

A further assumption relates to the expected 
dividend path. The approach chosen in this an -
alysis takes account of short- term firm- specific 
dividend expectations gleaned from surveys as 
well as long- term gross dividend expectations, 
which are assumed to evolve in line with mod -
elled economic output. The estimated cost of 
the company’s direct greenhouse gas emissions 
is deducted from these long- term gross divi -
dends23 to yield a net dividend path.
The present analysis assumes that region-  
specific progress in reducing the intensity of 
emissions is reflected at the company level. The 
companies studied in this analysis are domiciled 
in 75 countries from various regions of the 
world, where their businesses are subject to the 
prevailing national climate policies. In order to 
calculate the indicator, it is assumed that the 
companies work under the regional circum -
stances presumed in the REMIND- MAgPIE 
model. A company is assigned to one of the 
twelve regions based on where the parent com -pany is headquartered. It is thus assumed, for 
simplicity, that this firm’s greenhouse gas emis -
sions will also all take place in the region in 
which the company is headquartered.
Finally, the baseline scenario assumes that com -
panies are not, or only partially, able to pass on 
higher CO₂ prices to consumers. In order to 
quantify the bandwidth of potential effects, 
this analysis differentiates between two cases: 
first, the case without cost pass- through and, 
second, the case with an 80% pass- through. In 
the first case, any emissions costs incurred will 
reduce profits and consequently dividends as 
well. If the cost of emissions is already reflected 
in dividend expectations in the baseline scen -.. and the

23 The required firm- specific emissions pathway starts with 
the company’s current (reported or estimated) emissions 
and is assumed to evolve in line with scenario- specific de -
carbonisation. The company’s future cost pattern is deter -
mined by developments in CO₂ prices as well as the growth 
rates of the modelled emissions. Progress in reducing emis -
sions intensity (see the chart on p. 68) is consequently im -
posed for the companies under review.Deutsche Bundesbank

ario, only that percentage of the costs that ex -
ceeds the costs in the baseline scenario will 
have to be deducted from dividends in the 
“Net Zero 2050” scenario.
Ultimately, two factors determine the compa -
ny’s net dividend path: the deviation of the 
output paths from the baseline scenario and 
the incremental emissions- related costs as a re -
sult of the remaining emissions (see the box on 
pp. 70 ff.). Depending on data availability, the 
net dividend paths also reflect the degree to 
which companies generate revenues from the 
sale of fossil energy sources or electricity pro -
duced from such sources.24
If the scenario- specific net dividends are dis -
counted using the same interest rate (in this 
case, a firm- specific interest rate) as in the 
baseline scenario, valuation effects can be de -
rived by comparing the resulting present value 
with the actual equity price. We determine this 
present value based on the firm- specific implied cost of capital, as required by investors at the 
base date using the baseline scenario and the 
equity price at that date. The resulting firm-  
specific changes in value are subsequently ag -
gregated and evaluated at the sectoral and 
macroeconomic level.25

ect emissions (known as scope 1 emissions) 
from the production process or the services the 
company provides are distinct from indirect 
emissions (scope 2) that come about as a result 
of the purchase of electricity or heat. A further 
distinction (scope 3) covers emissions from up -
stream and downstream stages of the supply 
chain or in connection with the use of the 
product.
Firm- specific data on greenhouse gas emissions 
are provided by various suppliers that base 
their information on company reports or esti -
mations. On this basis and using additional 
data at the firm level, the above- mentioned 
price impact indicator is calculated for a total 
of 5,285 non- financial stock corporations from 
75 countries. These companies account for 
more than half of global stock market capital -
isation. The percentage of direct greenhouse 
gas emissions they represent amounts to be -
tween 17% (9.4 billion tonnes of CO₂ equiva -
lents) and 20% (10.5 billion tonnes) of total global emissions, depending on the data sup -
plier. The following analyses are based on infor -
mation gleaned from company reports and 
estimates provided by ISS- ESG, which supplies 
emissions data for all the companies observed 
here.
The chart on p. 74 depicts average emissions 
intensities for individual sectors (greenhouse 
gas emissions in 1,000 tonnes of CO₂ equiva -
lents per €1 million in revenues). It shows, first, 
direct emissions (scope 1) as reported by the 
companies or estimated by ISS- ESG. Second, it 
depicts the bandwidth of sector averages of 
the intensities of indirect emissions (scope 2) 
and product or supply chain- related emissions 
(scope 3) based on estimates provided by two 
data suppliers. In most sectors, this imprecision 
in terms of these emissions is considerable.

part of companies’ carbon footprint where 
data reliability is greatest. Another advantage is 
that direct emissions can be aggregated with -
out double counting.27
Importance of sectors in terms 
of greenhouse gas emissions 
and market capitalisation
In many cases, the size of a firm’s carbon foot -
print as measured by direct greenhouse gas 
emissions does not reflect its importance in 
financial markets (see the chart on p. 75). Look -
ing ahead to the results, that means that losses 
that depend on the level of emissions have a 
massive impact on part of equities, but this part 
is fairly small in relation to total stock market 
capitalisation. This applies to companies in the 
coal, gas and oil industry, for instance, as well 
as to other energy industry companies and 
companies in the cement and steel industries.A subset of 502 stock corporations can be as -
signed to the above- listed energy sectors based 
on available information on the revenue share 
generated from the respective energy source 
(source: ISS- ESG). If, say, the extraction of coal 
or the production of electricity from coal ac -
counted for more than 50% of revenues in 
2019, then that company is assigned to the 
coal sector. The same is done for companies 
whose business models are tied to other fossil 
or non- fossil energy sources, where companies 
active in the oil and gas business and com -
panies focusing on renewables are aggregated 
in each case.

Results
As described in the box on pp. 70 ff., shifts in 
the value of the companies under analysis are 
expressed as the scenario- based present value 
changes of the shares in relation to the actual share price. In total, 5,285 stock corporations 
are valued relative to their share price at the 
end of 2020 and the dividend expectations at 
this point in time. These valuation effects can 
be presented in the form of a loss distribution. 
The chart on p. 76 shows – broken down by 
degree of cost pass- through – for certain inter -
vals in the rates of value change the sum of the 
respective market capitalisation attributable to 
them (before the valuation change, as of end-

costs from direct greenhouse gas emissions, 
shares to the tune of just over €35 trillion (or 
78% of the total market capitalisation under 
observation) are left unscathed by emissions-  
related share price losses of more than 4%. At 
the same time, however, more than one- tenth 
of the total market capitalisation (€4.7 trillion) 
suffers losses of more than one- half of com -
pany values as a result of higher emissions 
costs and deviating value added paths.
Assuming instead a cost pass- through of 80%, 
share price losses are limited to less than 4% 
for 87% of market capitalisation (€38.6 trillion). 
At the same time, shares to the tune of €1.9 
trillion suffer losses of more than 50%.
The price impact indicator calculated at the 
company level can be aggregated for individual 
sectors. In the chart on p. 77, each analysed 
sector is split into a more emissions- intensive 
and a less emissions- intensive half of com -
panies. For each of these halves, unweighted loss ratios (in negative territory) are deter -
mined. Positive average value changes are not 
fundamentally out of range, though; they do 
occur in some cases for renewables.
It is evident that emissions intensity is one of 
the factors that determine the size of the valu -
ation effect. The “greener half” is associated 
with smaller value losses for the stocks under 
observation. However, in several sectors, this 
relationship is overlain by the influence of devi -
ating value added paths.
The price impact indicator presented here is 
sensitive to changes in individual assumptions. 
The results outlined so far are limited to the 
case where all companies reduce their emis -
sions in line with the “Net Zero 2050” scenario. 
This Paris-  aligned response of emissions is de -
picted using a cut- off point at 100% in the ad -
jacent chart.28 This chart exemplifies, for a no -
tional company, the sensitivity of the price im -
pact indicator to the percentage of emissions 
costs that can be passed through and as a 
function of the pace of decarbonisation relative 
to the scenario pathway.
While the results explained above refer to a 
case in which the companies adapt their en -
ergy mix in line with the substitution elasticities 
used in the REMIND- MAgPIE model and decar -
bonise correspondingly (in a Paris- aligned man -
ner), individual companies might reduce their 
emissions to different degrees. As explained 
(see p. 72), the individual pace of decarbonisa -
tion is likely to depend on both the expected 
CO₂ price pathway and on the individual cost 
of avoiding emissions. If, meanwhile, the focus 
lies exclusively on emissions costs arising under 
the price projections in the Paris-  aligned scen -
ario, it is clear that value losses are higher the 
slower the pace of decarbonisation.A theoretical

Scenario- based value indicator 
for transition risk: quantifying 
stranding
The valuation approach presented here can be 
used to derive not only an emissions- related 
price effect, but also a measure for company 
“stranding”. In what follows, this is defined as 
the case where, after taking into account devi -
ating value added paths, the incremental costs 
of emissions will exceed the expected or pro -
jected gross dividends as of a certain future 
point in time.
This definition can be applied to the companies 
under review in the Paris- aligned scenario. The 
adjacent chart illustrates that the vast majority 
of stranding, both as measured by the number 
of companies and by their stock market capital -
isation (end- 2020), occurs in the five years to 
2025. This is also true if 80% of the incremen -
tal costs of greenhouse gas emissions can be 
passed through, although this assumption sees 
a somewhat larger percentage of companies 
stranding in the years after 2025 than is the 
case if the company has to bear all emissions- 
related costs.
Stranding stock market capitalisation can also 
be shown at the sector level. The table on 
p. 80 indicates that even given decarbonisation 
in line with the Paris- aligned “Net Zero 2050” 
scenario, the incremental costs from the re -
maining emissions and deviating output path -
ways can leave several sectors hard hit. This is 
particularly true if no cost pass- through is pos -
sible. Unsurprisingly, particularly badly affected 
sectors include the carbon- intensive cement 
and steel sectors as well as companies whose 
business centres on fossil energy sources – 
driven in part by projected sectoral output tra -
jectories. According to the calculations, strand -
ing stock market capitalisation amounts to 
€4.4 trillion without cost pass- through and 
€1.7 trillion with 80% cost pass- through. Leav -
ing aside stranding and taking into account all 
5,285 stock corporations under review, the ag -
gregate capitalisation- weighted loss ratio amounts to 12.4% (without pass- through) and 
6.0% (with 80% pass- through).
Constraints
One constraint to consider is that the price im -
pact indicator presented here does exhibit 
some measurement imprecision. The starting 
point for the quantification carried out in this 
article is that, first, market participants cur -
rently expect the “Nationally Determined Con -
tributions” scenario to be implemented.Definition of

This assumption is supported by indications in 
the empirical findings that greenhouse gas-  
related risks are already reflected in financial 
markets to a certain extent.29 It cannot be ruled 
out, however, that markets assume these com -
mitments will not be honoured in some regions 
of the world. If, for example, one were to 
choose a less optimistic “Current Policies” scen -
ario as the baseline scenario (see the charts on 
pp. 66 and 68), the value adjustments resulting 
from a flipover to a “Net Zero 2050” scenario 
would be more significant still. Second, an -
other factor to consider alongside this impreci -
sion is that the price impact indicator assumes 
a shift in expectations towards a Paris-  aligned 
scenario. As is usual in scenario analyses, it is si -
lent on whether, or with what probability, this 
will happen at the global level. When interpret -
ing the price impact indicator, it should further -
more be considered that the future (global) cli -
mate policy stance is subject to a high degree 
of uncertainty. This uncertainty also has a 
knock- on effect on market participants’ ex -pectations formation about the future CO₂ 
price pathway.
There is also uncertainty about how flexibly 
economic agents will respond to a rise in CO₂  
prices and whether the substitutability among 
energy sources assumed in the REMIND-  
MAgPIE model and the assumption of techno -
logical learning adequately captures their be -
haviour. In particular, no data are available on 
individual companies’ current and future emis -
sions avoidance costs, which, along with the 
CO₂ price, will determine the decision to decar -
bonise. This means the question of decarbonis -
ing certain production processes also remains 
subject to uncertainty.

another source of inaccuracy. This means, for 
example, that manufacturing sites of com -
panies which produce worldwide but are head -
quartered in Europe are assigned in their entir -
ety to Europe and subject to the projected 
European CO₂ prices.
The resulting valuation effects are, moreover, 
very much determined by the extent to which 
emissions costs can be passed on. The scope 
for companies to pass through costs depends 
on their competitive position in sales markets, 
say. Where a company has sufficient market 
power, it can, in extreme cases, avoid the bur -
den of emissions costs altogether. If, however, 
producers of intermediate goods manage to 
pass the attendant emissions costs through to 
a (downstream) company, the latter might, de -
pending on its competitive position, face costs 
beyond those associated with its own direct 
emissions.
Another source of imprecision in the indicator 
of the financial implications of higher CO₂ pri -
cing comes from the extent to which com -
panies have frontloaded the costs of foresee -
able emissions as protection against mounting 
emission costs over the coming years.30 If a 
company has already purchased enough emis -
sions allowances for the coming years, it will 
not incur any additional emissions costs no 
matter how tightly emissions rights are capped 
in this period and how strongly the CO₂ price 
will rise. Hence, the company will only have an 
incentive to reduce its greenhouse gas emis -
sions once the hedging period has elapsed. As 
a result, the valuation effects determined here 
could overstate the company’s actual emissions- 
related loss in value, provided it already has suf -
ficient emissions allowances. It is therefore in 
the absence of such hedging strategies that the 
proposed emissions- related price impact indi -
cator can be understood as a point of refer -
ence in terms of a shift towards Paris- aligned 
CO₂ pricing.Summary
The present article proposes an approach for 
quantifying valuation effects resulting from a 
shift in climate policy expectations. Its focus is 
on the difference between a scenario based on 
the implementation of Nationally Determined 
Contributions (consistent with global warming 
of 2.4°C) and the scenario of an orderly transi -
tion to a Paris- aligned low- carbon economy 
(consistent with global warming of 1.5°C). This 
analysis looks at the incremental costs arising 
from greenhouse gas emissions as well as from 
scenario- dependent deviations in the output 
pathways; no other shifts in costs are taken 
into account. Valuation effects resulting from 
ongoing physical climate change are disre -
garded as well.
The valuation method selected here is applied 
for 5,285 stock corporations from all over the 
world at the firm level. Together, they account 
for more than half of the global stock market 
capitalisation and are responsible for 17% to 
20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The 
potential price adjustment for individual com -
panies as a result of changed expectations is 
modelled using a multi- stage dividend discount 
model. This traditional valuation model is cali -
brated on firm- specific greenhouse gas emis -
sions and scenario data from a multi- regional 
integrated assessment model (REMIND-  
MAgPIE), which, amongst other things, models 
the energy systems in individual regions of the 
world in detail and allows for temporary re -
gional differences in climate policy.
This scenario- based valuation approach for 
transition risks is driven by various factors. First 
of all, the company valuation in the baseline … the country

30 In an emissions trading scheme, frontloading can be 
perceived as an issuer strategy to purchase emissions al -
lowances when their prices are low in such a quantity that, 
together with the emissions allowances allocated for free, 
they are sufficient to cover the expected greenhouse gas 
emissions in the hedging period. The price of emission al -
lowances in the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 
mid- 2017 was still €5 per tonne of CO₂ emitted, compared 
with around €80 at the end of 2021.Deutsche Bundesbank

scenario is pivotal. Here, in addition to the 
equity price and the individual dividend expect -
ations, the respective Nationally Determined 
Contributions are taken into account. This in -
formation is used to compute the firm- specific 
implied cost of capital, which is one of the de -
cisive factors in the price impact analysis. More -
over, the most significant factor for the major -
ity of companies is the CO₂ price trajectory in 
their particular region: together with the pro -
jected greenhouse gas emissions, this is what 
determines how the company’s emissions costs 
in a Paris- aligned scenario evolve relative to its 
emissions costs in the previously defined base -
line scenario. These incremental costs lower 
the projected firm- specific and scenario- specific 
dividends. In addition, scenario- specific output 
pathways are incorporated for selected sectors.
The cases analysed – first, where 80% of the 
incremental emissions- related costs are passed 
through and second, where the company bears 
all emissions- related costs – serve to estimate 
the bandwidth of potential losses. It is found that, in the case of a Paris- aligned decarbonisa -
tion by the companies, the vast majority of 
them, along with their stock market capitalisa -
tion, are only expected to suffer small losses in 
value even if CO₂ prices rise strongly. By con -
trast, considerable losses in value will be sus -
tained by a segment of stock corporations that 
are responsible for very high greenhouse gas 
emissions while expected dividends are rela -
tively small by comparison. In addition, com -
panies whose business activities are centred 
around fossil fuels will be strongly affected; 
they may face the risk of stranding even if they 
reduce emissions in compliance with the Paris 
Agreement.
The measure presented in this article provides a 
risk indication for the firm’s ability to bear emis -
sions costs under a given scenario. This type of 
indicator can help to better quantify price ad -
justments associated with transition risks and 
the risk of climate-  related stranding of certain 
assets.Scope for cost

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates

therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the

tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a

has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections as of 2020 Q1. Until 2019 Q4 these are compiled using Solvency I
supervisory data, supplemented by voluntary reports and own calculations.  1 Including
deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans
and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension funds on pension managers
and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical reserves "life" taking account oftransitional measures. Health insurance is also included in the "non-life insurance"
sector.  4 Own funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other
equity".  5 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by primary insurers, which
is included there.  6 Valuation at book values. The term "pension funds" refers to the
institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of Accounts. Pension funds
thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational pension schemes for the
self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  7 Change in data sources.

Exchange which publish IFRS consolidated financial statements on a quarterly or
half-yearly basis and make a noteworthy contribution to value added in Germany. Ex-
cluding groups engaged in real estate activities.  1 Earnings before interest, taxes, de-
preciation and amortisation.  2 Quantile data are based on the groups' unweighted re-
turn on sales.  3 Annual figures do not always match the sum of the two half-year fig-ures. See Quality report on consolidated financial statement statistics, p. 3.  4 Adjusted

reporting sample. See the explanatory notes in Statistical Series Seasonally adjusted
business statistics.  5 Including groups in agriculture and forestry.  6 From this point on-
wards: significant changes in IFRS standards, impairing comparability with previous pe-
riods.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective
exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitive-
ness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more
detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the
Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1  The
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
group EER-19 and additionally Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India,
