CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
The	upturn 	in	the	German 	economy 	contin -
ued	in	the	third 	quarter 	of	2011. 	The	“hard” 	
economic 	indicators 	available 	up	to	August 	
show 	a	sharp 	rise	in	overall 	economic 	output. 	
Seasonally 	adjusted 	industrial 	output 	in	July	
and	August 	increased 	considerably 	on	the	
previous 	period. 	Even 	though 	this	was	due	in	
part	to	special 	factors, 	such 	as	an	exceptional 	
pattern 	of	bridging 	days	and	holidays 	as	well	
as	the	foregoing 	of	plant 	shutdowns, 	above 	
all	in	the	automotive 	industry, 	a	significant 	
increase 	is	still	likely 	to	be	posted 	even 	given 	
the	fact	that	the	quarterly 	figure 	for	Septem -
ber	is	expected 	to	return 	to	normal. 	Con-
struction 	sector 	output 	in	the	third 	quarter 	is	
likely 	to	have 	at	least 	held	up	at	the	high	level	
recorded 	in	the	second 	quarter. 	The	adjust -
ment 	in	the	level	of	energy 	output 	in	connec -
tion	with	the	phasing-out 	of	nuclear 	energy 	
now	seems 	to	be	largely 	complete. 	Private 	
consumption 	is	likely 	to	have 	picked 	up	
somewhat 	after 	declining 	in	the	second 	quar-
ter.	Retail 	sales 	are	likely 	to	exceed 	the	level	
of	the	previous 	quarter. 	Furthermore, 	new	
passenger 	car	registrations 	rose	perceptibly 	
and	sales 	of	heating 	oil	also	picked 	up	again 	
following 	weak 	demand 	in	the	second 	quar-
ter.
There 	was	a	further 	deterioration 	in	the	eco-
nomic 	outlook 	for	the	winter 	half-year 	of	
2011-12. 	Expectations 	in	trade 	and	industry 	
were 	scaled 	back 	again 	and	there 	was	a	per-
ceptible 	decline 	in	the	inflow 	of	new	orders,

Given 	the	noticeably 	weaker 	pace 	of	growth 	
in	demand, 	industry, 	in	particular, 	will	proba -
bly	find	it	hard 	in	the	coming 	months 	to	
maintain 	in	seasonally 	adjusted 	terms 	the	
level 	of	production 	recorded 	in	the	third 	
quarter, 	which 	was	also	increased 	by	special 	
measures.
Industry
Industrial 	output 	in	August 	fell	by	a	season -
ally	adjusted 	1.0% 	on	the	month. 	The	fact	
that	there 	were 	comparatively 	few	days	of	
school 	holiday 	in	July	compared 	with 	the	
large 	number 	in	August 	is	likely 	to	have 	
played 	a	part	in	this.	On	an	average 	of	these 	
two	months, 	industrial 	output 	rose	3½% 	on	
the	average 	of	the	previous 	three-month 	
	period. 	The	output 	of	capital 	goods 	produc -
ers	saw	an	exceptionally 	sharp 	increase, 	at	a	
seasonally 	adjusted 	6%.	The	foregoing 	of	
plant 	shutdowns 	in	parts 	of	the	automotive 	
industry 	played 	a	key	part	in	this.	Excluding 	
motor 	vehicle 	production, 	which 	was	up	one-
tenth 	on	the	quarter 	in	July	and	August, 	
growth 	in	this	industrial 	sector 	was	still	as	
high 	as	3½%. 	Taking 	July	and	August 	to-
gether, 	the	output 	of	intermediate 	goods 	
went 	up	by	2½%. 	Around 	half	of	this	in-
crease 	was	attributable 	to	the	production 	of	
semi-conductors 	and	other 	components 	
	being 	stepped 	up	sharply. 	There 	was, 	how-
ever, 	a	decline 	in	the	production 	of	chemicals 	
and	the	manufacture 	of	basic 	metals. 	The	
manufacture 	of	consumer 	goods 	fell	by	1 %.
Industrial 	new	orders 	in	August 	showed 	a	
marked 	decline 	on	the	month 	by	a	seasonally 	
adjusted 	1½%. 	The	pattern 	of	holidays 	is	also	Strong growth

likely	 to	have	 had	 a	noticeable	 effect	 on	the	
demand	 side.	 This	 is	suggested,	 in	particular,	
by	the	fact	 that	 domestic	 orders	 in	the	auto -
motive	 industry	 fell	by	7%	between	 July	and	
August,	 whereas,	 on	an	average	 of	the	same	
two-month 	period, 	they	were 	up	by	a	sea-
sonally	 adjusted	 1½%	 on	the	quarter.	 On	an	
average 	of	July	and	August, 	the	overall 	vol-
ume	of	orders 	fell	by	a	seasonally 	adjusted	
1½% 	on	the	second 	quarter, 	in	which 	very	
extensive 	large-scale 	orders, 	primarily 	for	
capital 	goods, 	were 	received. 	Nevertheless,	
the	inflow 	of	new	orders 	seems 	to	have	
cooled 	down 	significantly, 	especially 	from	
non-euro-area	 countries.
Industrial	 sales	 went	 up	by	3¼%	 on	the	quar-
ter	in	the	two-month	 period	 of	July	and	 Au-
gust,	 with	 growth	 in	export	 sales,	 at	4%,	 be-
ing	much	 more	 pronounced	 than	 the	increase	
in	sales	 to	domestic	 customers	 (+2½%).	 Fol-
lowing 	the	sharp 	increase 	in	the	reporting	
month,	 the	value	 of	exports	 of	goods	 in	July	
and	August 	was	not	quite 	1½% 	up	on	the	
level	 of	the	previous	 quarter.	 Nominal	 imports	
of	goods	 experienced	 growth	 to	the	same	 ex-
tent	 after	 the	high	 level	 achieved	 in	July	was	
matched 	again 	in	August 	in	seasonally 	ad-
justed	 terms.
Construction
Excluding 	holiday 	effects, 	construction 	out-
put	in	August	 kept	 up	at	the	high	 level	 of	the	
previous 	month. 	Taking 	the	average 	of	July	
and	 August,	 construction	 output	 went	 up	by	
¾%; 	building 	construction 	expanded 	by	1 %	
and	civil	engineering 	by	½%. 	Construction	
orders, 	which 	are	rather 	volatile, 	showed 	a	sharp 	increase 	in	July	compared 	with 	June	
(more	 recent	 data	 are	unavailable	 at	present).	
The	rise	in	output 	in	civil	engineering 	was	
particularly	 high	 owing	 to	one	major	 order.
Labour market
The	upward 	trend 	in	the	labour 	market 	re-
mains	 intact.	 According	 to	the	provisional	 fig-
ures	of	the	Federal 	Statistical 	Office, 	the	
month-on-month 	rise	in	number 	of	persons	
in	work 	in	Germany 	in	August, 	at	a	season -
ally	adjusted	 29,000,	 was,	 in	fact,	 somewhat	
more 	pronounced 	than 	in	July.	Compared	
with	 the	previous	 year,	 there	 was	 an	increase	
of	515,000,	 or	1.3%.	 The	number	 of	persons	
in	jobs	 subject	 to	full	social	 security	 contribu -
tions	 is	likely	 to	have	 increased	 further.	 Year-
on-year	 job	growth	 amounted	 to	672,000,	 or	
2.4%, 	in	July.	According 	to	the	ifo	employ -
ment 	barometer, 	the	willingness 	of	enter -
prises	 to	recruit	 new	 staff	 remained	 at	a	very	
high	 level	 in	September.	 The	Federal	 Employ -
ment	 Agency’s	 BA-X	 job	index	 remained	 sta-
ble	at	a	record	 high	 level.
In	September,	 the	official	 unemployment	 fig-
ure	fell	by	a	seasonally 	adjusted 	26,000	
to	2.92	 million.	 The	unemployment	 rate	 (us-
ing	the	Federal	 Employment	 Agency’s	 defini -
tion) 	fell	to	6.9%. 	Given 	that	labour 	market	
policy 	measures 	are	being 	scaled 	back 	as	a	
result	 of	the	improved	 employment	 situation,	
total 	underemployment 	as	recorded 	by	the	
Federal	 Labour	 Agency	 fell	a	great	 deal	 more	
on	the	year	(509,000 	persons) 	than 	regis -
tered	 unemployment	 (231,000	 persons).Decline in new

Prices
At	a	monthly 	average 	of	US$110 	in	Septem -
ber,	the	price 	for	a	barrel 	of	Brent 	crude 	oil	
remained 	at	its	August 	level. 	After 	rising 	for	a	
time, 	crude 	oil	prices 	fell	sharply 	again 	over	
the	course 	of	September. 	This	trend 	went 	
into	reverse 	again 	at	the	beginning 	of	Octo -
ber	and	crude 	oil	prices 	crept 	back 	up	again 	
to	around 	US$110. 	Crude 	oil	futures 	were 	be-
ing	quoted 	at	a	discount 	of	US$6¼ 	six	
months 	ahead 	and	US$8½ 	12	months 	ahead.
The	decline 	in	oil	prices 	between 	July	and	Au-
gust	also	made 	itself 	felt	at	the	upstream 	
stages 	of	the	economy. 	Import 	prices 	of	en-
ergy	in	August 	fell	by	a	seasonally 	adjusted 	
4.4% 	on	the	month. 	This	was	the	main 	rea-
son	for	the	marked 	decline 	in	import 	prices 	
by	a	seasonally 	adjusted 	1 %.	This	effect 	had	
no	noticeable 	impact 	on	domestic 	producer 	
prices, 	which 	decreased 	only	marginally 	on	
the	month. 	If	energy 	is	excluded, 	the	prices 	
of	both 	imports 	and	domestic 	products 	fell	
by	0.2%. 	The	year-on-year 	figure 	for	import 	
prices 	decreased 	perceptibly 	to	6.6%, 	and	
marginally 	in	the	case	of	domestic 	producer 	
prices 	to	5.5%.
Consumer 	prices 	in	September 	rose	by	a	sea-
sonally 	adjusted 	0.4% 	on	the	month, 	a	slight 	
decline 	having 	been 	recorded 	in	August. 	
There 	was	a	marked 	rise	in	industrial 	goods 	
prices, 	in	particular, 	and	energy 	prices 	also	
rose	perceptibly 	as	a	result 	of	price 	increases 	
for	crude 	oil	products. 	There 	was	a	slight 	rise	
in	the	prices 	of	services. 	Food 	prices 	remained 	
unchanged 	on	average. 	Annual 	inflation 	
went 	up	from 	+2.4% 	in	August 	to	+2.6% 	in	September 	according 	to	the	national 	CPI	and	
from 	+2.5% 	to	+2.9% 	according 	to	the	HICP .
Public finances1
Local government finances
The	favourable 	development 	of	local 	govern -
ment 	budgets 	continued 	in	the	second 	quar-
ter	of	2011. 	A	surplus 	of	€1	billion 	in	the	mu-
nicipal 	core	budgets 	can	be	derived 	from 	the	
latest 	cash	statistics 	figures 	released 	by	the	
Federal 	Statistical 	Office, 	compared 	with 	a	
deficit 	of	€1½	billion 	one	year	previously.2	
Revenue 	again 	rose	sharply, 	by	7½% 	(or	€3	
billion). 	The	increase 	in	tax	receipts 	(+6½%, 	
or	€1	billion), 	in	particular 	for	business 	tax	
(+9% 	after 	deduction 	of	the	shares 	accruing 	
to	other 	government 	levels), 	once 	more 	made 	
a	major 	contribution 	to	this	rise.	Furthermore, 	
there 	was	strong 	growth 	(+13%, 	or	€1	bil-
lion)	in	general 	grants 	from 	state 	govern -
ment, 	which 	are	coupled 	–	usually 	with 	a	
time	lag	–	to	the	level	of	tax	receipts, 	and	in	
revenue 	from 	fees	and	business 	activities. 	The	
rise	in	expenditure 	was	much 	more 	moderate 	
(2%, 	or	€1	billion). 	Growth 	in	personnel 	ex-

spending	 on	social	 benefits	 (+1½%)	 was	 rela-
tively	 restrained.	 In	the	case	 of	the	latter,	 an	
increase	 in	spending	 on	social	 assistance	 and	
assistance 	for	young 	people 	was	offset 	by	a	
marked 	fall	in	accommodation 	costs 	for	un-
employed 	social 	welfare 	recipients. 	Expendi -
ture	 on	capital	 formation	 was	 down	 by	2%.
The	positive	 budgetary	 development	 is	set	to	
continue	 –	albeit	 in	all	likelihood	 at	a	slower	
rate	 –	in	the	second	 half	of	the	year,	 meaning	
that	 the	deficit	 for	the	year	 as	a	whole	 is	ex-
pected	 to	be	much	 lower	 (2010:	€7½	 billion).	
Local 	government 	debt 	has	now	reached 	a	
new	 high.	 Despite	 the	above-mentioned	 sur-
plus	in	the	second 	quarter, 	from 	the	end	of	
March 	the	core	budgets’ 	aggregate 	credit	
market	 debt	 rose	 by	€½	billion	 to	€78	 billion.	
The	volume	 of	cash	 advances	 –	which	 are	ac-
tually 	only	intended 	for	bridging 	short-term	
liquidity 	shortfalls 	–	also	continued 	to	rise	
during	 this	period.	 Including	 off-budget	 enti-
ties,	they	grew 	by	€1	billion 	to	almost 	€44	
billion. 	This	demonstrates 	the	very	strained	
budgetary 	situation 	that	many 	local 	govern -
ments	 continue	 to	face.
Starting	 with	 this	quarter,	 the	Federal	 Statisti -
cal	Office 	now 	additionally 	publishes 	ex-
tended 	cumulated 	cash 	statistics 	data 	that	
include	 local	 government	 off-budget	 entities	
attributable	 to	the	government	 sector	 in	ad-
dition	 to	the	core	 budgets.3	This	 enables	 the	
extension 	of	the	consolidated 	group, 	which	
took 	place 	in	the	national 	accounts 	in	sum-
mer	2011, 	to	likewise 	be	made 	in	the	cash	
statistics 	and	thus	facilitates 	a	better 	overall	
picture	 of	current	 developments	 in	local	 gov-
ernment	 budgets.	 This	 is	especially	 important	as	business 	entities 	were 	outsourced 	from	
municipal	 core	 budgets	 to	a	notable	 extent	 in	
the	past,	 so	that	 the	previously	 recorded	 cash	
statistics 	developments 	were 	distorted 	as	a	
result.4	However, 	changing 	the	reporting	
group 	has	had	only	a	small 	impact 	on	the	
amount 	of	deficit 	recorded 	for	the	first	half	
of	this	year.	 Nevertheless,	 on	the	whole,	 miss-

For	the	first	 six	months	 of	2011,	 the	deficit	 for	the	core	
budgets	 and	off-budget	 entities	 amounted	 to	just	under	
€5	billion 	(compared 	with	€8½ 	billion 	one	year	previ -
ously).	 Off-budget	 entities	 account	 for	€½	billion	 of	this	
sum. 	The	core	budgets 	and	off-budget 	entities 	had	
credit 	market 	debt 	of	€84½ 	billion 	(compared 	with	
€83½	 billion	 at	the	end	of	March).

Securities markets
Bond market
In	August 	2011, 	the	issue 	volume 	in	the	Ger-
man	bond 	market 	stood 	at	€132.6 	billion 	in	
gross 	terms 	(previous 	month: 	€106.5 	billion). 	
After 	deducting 	the	considerably 	reduced 	re-
demptions 	and	taking 	account 	of	changes 	in	
issuers’ 	holdings 	of	their 	own	bonds, 	the	vol-
ume 	of	outstanding 	domestic 	bonds 	in-
creased 	by	€38.4 	billion, 	compared 	with 	a	
reduction 	of	€13.9 	billion 	in	July.	Foreign 	debt 	
securities 	worth 	€2.3	billion 	were 	sold	on	the	
German 	bond 	market; 	these 	sales 	were 	ex-
clusively 	accounted 	for	by	euro-denominated 	
debt 	securities. 	Thus, 	on	balance, 	the	out-
standing 	volume 	of	bonds 	in	Germany 	rose	
by	€40.7 	billion.
In	the	reporting 	month, 	the	public 	sector 	
raised 	€20.8 	billion 	in	the	capital 	market. 	This	
was	largely 	attributable 	to	central 	govern -
ment 	(€16.1 	billion), 	which 	on	balance 	mainly 	
sold	two-year 	Federal 	Treasury 	notes 	(Schätze: 	
€7.0	billion) 	and	ten-year 	bonds 	(Bunds: 	€4.7	
billion). 	By	contrast, 	Federal 	Treasury 	discount 	
paper 	(Bubills) 	worth 	€2.2 	billion 	net	was	re-
deemed. 	The	German 	Länder 	tapped 	the	
capital 	market 	for	€4.7 	billion 	net	in	the	
month 	under 	review.
German 	credit 	institutions 	increased 	their 	
capital 	market 	debt 	by	€16.7 	billion 	in	Au-
gust. 	Issuance 	primarily 	included 	€15.3 	billion 	net	worth 	of	specialised 	credit 	institutions’ 	
debt 	securities, 	but	other 	bank 	debt 	securi -
ties	which 	can	be	structured 	flexibly 	were 	
also	placed 	in	the	market 	in	the	amount 	of	
€5.1	billion. 	Meanwhile, 	redemptions 	of	pub-
lic	Pfandbriefe 	and	mortgage 	Pfandbriefe 	to-
talled 	€3.1	billion 	and	€0.6 	billion 	respec -
tively.
In	the	reporting 	month, 	domestic 	enterprises 	
issued 	bonds 	totalling 	€0.9	billion, 	compared 	
with	€2.5 	billion 	in	July.	On	balance, 	these 	
were 	all	bonds 	with	a	maturity 	of	less	than 	
one	year.
Foreign 	investors 	were 	the	main 	net	buyers 	in	
the	German 	bond 	market 	in	August, 	adding 	
debt 	securities 	with	a	total 	value 	of	€34.9 	bil-
lion	to	their 	portfolios. 	Domestic 	non-banks 	
also	purchased 	bonds 	amounting 	to	€15.2 	
billion 	net,	whereas 	German 	credit 	institu -
tions 	sold	debt 	securities 	with	a	net	value 	of	
€9.4 	billion.
Equities
In	the	month 	under 	review, 	domestic 	enter -
prises, 	most 	of	which 	were 	non-listed 	com-
panies, 	issued 	€0.2 	billion 	worth 	of	new	
shares 	in	the	German 	equity 	market. 	At	the	
same 	time, 	the	amount 	of	foreign 	shares 	out-
standing 	in	the	German 	market 	decreased 	by	
€3.4 	billion. 	In	net	terms, 	equities 	were 	solely 	
purchased 	by	resident 	non-banks 	(€4.6 	bil-
lion). 	By	contrast, 	domestic 	credit 	institutions 	
and	foreign 	investors 	sold	shares 	in	net	terms 	
(€5.2 	billion 	and	€2.5	billion 	respectively).High net sales

Mutual funds
German 	mutual 	funds 	recorded 	a	net	out-
flow	of	€1.3	billion 	net	in	August 	(July: 	inflow 	
of	€6.4 	billion). 	This	affected 	only	funds 	open 	
to	the	general 	public 	(€2.5 	billion), 	while 	spe-
cialised 	funds 	reserved 	for	institutional 	inves -
tors	recorded 	inflows 	in	the	value 	of	€1.2	bil-
lion.	Among 	the	mutual 	funds 	open 	to	the	
general 	public, 	equity-based 	funds 	(€1.2 	bil-
lion)	and	mixed 	securities-based 	funds 	(€1.0 	
billion) 	especially 	repurchased 	shares, 	al-
though 	mixed 	funds 	did	too,	albeit 	to	a	lesser 	
extent 	(€0.4 	billion). 	Only 	money 	market 	
funds 	sold	shares 	in	the	market 	(€0.4 	billion). 	
During 	the	month 	under 	review, 	foreign 	
funds 	traded 	in	the	German 	market 	repur -
chased 	fund 	shares 	worth 	€2.2 	billion. 	On	
balance, 	mutual 	fund 	shares 	were 	acquired 	
exclusively 	by	domestic 	credit 	institutions 	
(€0.4 	billion). 	By	contrast, 	German 	non-banks 	
sold	shares 	in	the	amount 	of	€3.9	billion.
Balance of payments
The	German 	current 	account 	recorded 	a	sur-
plus	–	in	unadjusted 	terms 	–	of	€7.0	billion 	in	
August 	2011. 	The	result 	was	€0.8 	billion 	
down 	on	the	level 	of	the	previous 	month. 	
This	was	mainly 	due	to	an	increase 	in	the	def-
icit	on	invisible 	current 	transactions, 	which 	
comprise 	services, 	income 	and	current 	trans -
fers.	By	contrast, 	the	trade 	surplus 	expanded.
According 	to	provisional 	figures 	from 	the	
Federal 	Statistical 	Office, 	in	August 	the	for-
eign	trade 	surplus 	rose	by	€1.3	billion 	on	the	
month 	to	€11.8 	billion. 	After 	adjustment 	for	seasonal 	and	calendar 	variations, 	it	went 	up	
by	€3.1	billion 	to	€13.8 	billion. 	The	value 	of	
exports 	rose	rather 	sharply 	by	3.5%, 	while 	
the	value 	of	imports 	remained 	at	the	high	
level	of	the	previous 	month. 	In	seasonally 	ad-
justed 	terms, 	nominal 	exports 	as	well	as	im-
ports 	in	July	and	August, 	taken 	together, 	
were 	1.4% 	above 	the	second-quarter 	aver-
age.	On	the	export 	side, 	this	was	attributable 	
to	a	slight 	increase 	in	prices 	compared 	with	
the	second 	quarter, 	while 	import 	prices 	fell	
somewhat.
In	August, 	the	deficit 	on	invisible 	current 	
transactions 	expanded 	by	€1.6	billion 	to	€3.0 	
billion. 	This	was	caused 	by	a	marked 	worsen -
ing	of	the	deficit 	on	services, 	which 	doubled 	
to	€4.3 	billion 	in	the	month 	under 	review,

current 	transfers 	declined 	by	€0.5 	billion 	to	
€3.2 	billion. 	At	€4.5 	billion, 	the	surplus 	in	
cross-border 	income 	held	steady 	at	the	pre-
vious 	month’s 	level.
Cross-border 	portfolio 	investment 	generated 	
high	net	capital 	imports 	in	August 	(€35.9 	bil-
lion), 	in	large 	part	as	a	result 	of	transactions 	
by	non-resident 	investors 	who	acquired 	Ger-
man 	securities 	worth 	€32.5 	billion. 	In	the	
main 	they	purchased 	German 	debt 	securities, 	
with	a	particular 	emphasis 	on	public 	sector 	
bonds 	(€20.0 	billion) 	and	money 	market 	in-
struments 	(€10.6 	billion). 	Parallel 	to	this,	they	
disposed 	of	shares 	to	the	tune 	of	€2.4	billion. 	
German 	investors 	scaled 	back 	their 	cross-
border 	exposure 	by	€3.4 	billion, 	selling 	shares 	
(€3.5 	billion) 	and	mutual 	fund 	shares 	(€2.2 	
billion) 	but	acquiring 	foreign 	debt 	securities 	
(€2.3 	billion).
Direct 	investment 	resulted 	in	modest 	net	cap-
ital	exports 	(€1.4 	billion) 	in	the	month 	of	Au-
gust. 	The	main 	reason 	for	this	was	invest -
ment 	by	German 	enterprises 	abroad 	(€1.6

The debt brake in Germany –  
key aspects and implementation
In	2009, 	the	German 	parliament 	passed 	a	fundamental 	reform 	of	government 	borrowing 	rules. 	
For	central 	and	state 	government, 	strict 	borrowing 	limits 	and	the	requirement 	for	a	structurally 	
close-to-balance 	or	balanced 	budget 	were 	constitutionally 	enshrined 	in	the	German 	Basic 	Law	
(Grundgesetz) .	Exemptions 	were 	defined 	much 	more 	narrowly 	and	tied	to	repayment 	rules. 	The	
reform 	is	also	designed 	to	ensure 	compliance 	with	the	medium-term 	objective 	for	the	general 	
government 	deficit 	that	is	established 	in	the	European 	Stability 	and	Growth 	Pact. 	Before 	the	
limits 	become 	binding, 	there 	will	be	a	transitional 	period 	extending 	to	2020 	for	the	states 	and	
to	2016 	for	central 	government.
This	reform 	is	a	very	welcome 	development 	and	a	clear 	improvement 	on	the	status quo ante .	
The	current 	sovereign 	debt 	crisis 	has	driven 	home 	the	key	importance 	of	safeguarding 	sound 	
public 	finances, 	and	strict 	national 	rules 	play	a	major 	part	in	achieving 	this	objective. 	Rigorous 	
implementation 	of	and	adherence 	to	the	new	provisions 	are	crucial 	for	the	reform’s 	success; 	
transparency 	regarding 	both 	the	rules 	and	their 	application 	is	especially 	important. 	In	particular, 	
this	will	allow 	the	general 	public 	to	monitor 	the	implementation 	of	the	rules.
At	present, 	developments 	in	Germany’s 	public 	finances 	are	better 	than 	expected, 	and	the	coun -
try’s	previously 	very	high	deficits 	are	falling 	sharply. 	To	date, 	the	new	rules 	have 	probably 	notice -
ably	supported 	the	initiated 	path 	of	consolidation. 	Nonetheless, 	central 	government 	has	set	very	
high	deficit 	ceilings 	for	the	transitional 	period, 	and	several 	states 	appear 	to	be	postponing 	ulti-
mately 	unavoidable 	consolidation 	measures. 	It	is	important 	to	swiftly 	achieve 	balanced 	budgets 	
at	all	levels 	of	government. 	Furthermore, 	all	government 	entities 	would 	be	well	advised 	to	incor -
porate 	a	safety 	margin 	below 	the	constitutional 	ceiling, 	thus	avoiding 	the	need 	for	short-term 	
adjustments 	that	could 	have 	a	procyclical 	impact, 	particularly 	given 	unexpected 	adverse 	develop -
ments. 	To	avoid 	incurring 	excessive 	structural 	debt 	in	line	with	the	new	budgetary 	rules, 	it	is	also	
necessary 	to	appropriately 	define 	the	financial 	transactions 	that	are	to	be	factored 	out	of	the	
borrowing 	limit, 	ensure 	that	positive 	and	negative 	cyclical 	effects 	are	truly	taken 	into	account 	in	
a	symmetric 	fashion, 	and	prohibit 	government 	borrowing 	via	entities 	outside 	of	the	core	budg -

Main elements of the new debt brake
Central 	government 	borrowing 	has	been 	re-
stricted 	by	the	Basic 	Law	and	state 	govern -
ment 	borrowing 	by	the	state 	constitutions 	
ever	since 	the	Federal 	Republic 	of	Germany 	
was	founded. 	The	provisions 	in	place 	before 	
the	recent 	reform 	–	some 	of	which 	can	still	
be	applied 	during 	the	transitional 	phase 	–	
stipulated 	that	borrowing 	must 	not,	as	a	gen-
eral	rule,	exceed 	total 	projected 	investment 	
expenditure. 	Nonetheless, 	the	debt 	ratio 	rose	
sharply 	over	time	(see	chart 	on	this	page) 	and	
was	not	offset 	by	a	corresponding 	increase 	in	
general 	government 	assets.1
In	addition 	to	the	fact	that	investment 	ex-
penditure 	was	defined 	too	loosely, 	the	main 	
weaknesses 	identified 	in	the	previous 	rules 	
were 	the	overly 	vague 	definition 	of	the	ex-
emption 	clause 	for	averting 	a	disruption 	of	
the	macroeconomic 	equilibrium, 	which 	did	
not	impose 	any	repayment 	obligations, 	the	
general 	possibility 	for	exempting 	off-budget 	
special 	funds 	from 	the	rules 	and	the	inade -
quate 	monitoring 	of	compliance 	at	budget 	
outturn. 	To	rectify 	these 	deficiencies, 	a	com-
prehensive 	reform 	of	the	constitutional 	rules 	
was	debated 	in	the	latter 	part	of	the	previous 	
decade 	at	central 	and	state 	government 	level. 	
This	reform 	was	adopted 	in	early 	summer 	
2009 	after 	achieving 	a	broad 	consensus 	in	
both 	houses 	of	parliament 	(Bundestag 	and	
Bundesrat).
Common 	principles 	are	established 	for	cen-
tral	and	state 	government 	in	Article 	109	of	
the	Basic 	Law; 	Article 	109	II	of	the	Basic 	Law	
stipulates 	adherence 	to	the	euro-area 	budget -ary	rules. 	The	statement 	of	legislative 	intent 	
accompanying 	the	draft 	act	makes 	it	clear 	
that	this	applies, 	in	particular, 	to	the	require -
ment 	in	the	Stability 	and	Growth 	Pact	for	a	
structural 	general 	government 	budget 	posi-
tion	that	is	at	least 	close-to-balance.2
The	debt 	brake 	enshrined 	in	Article 	109	III	of	
the	Basic 	Law	explicitly 	requires 	that, 	as	a	
general 	rule, 	central 	and	state 	government 	
must 	achieve 	balanced 	budgets 	without 	in-
curring 	new	debt, 	and	it	therefore 	differs 	
substantially 	from 	the	previous 	investment-
related 	borrowing 	limit. 	The	debt 	brake 	does 	Previous consti-

not	merely 	set	a	target; 	it	imposes 	a	ceiling	
that	must 	not	be	overshot. 	Suitable 	safety	
margins 	are	therefore 	needed 	to	allow 	gov-
ernments	 fiscal	 leeway	 under	 the	new	 rules.	
Given 	the	clarity 	of	the	rules, 	any	planned	
contravention	 of	the	borrowing	 limit	 could	 at	
least	 be	halted	 by	the	constitutional	 courts	 if	
someone 	were 	to	file	a	suit.	Unfortunately,	
however,	 the	new	 rules	 contain	 no	automatic	
triggers 	in	the	event 	of	the	limit	being 	con-
travened. 	While 	there 	is	no	comparable 	ex-
plicit 	deficit 	limit	for	local 	government 	and	
the	social 	security 	funds, 	the	latter 	are	per-
mitted	 to	borrow	 on	the	capital	 market	 only	
in	exceptional 	cases 	anyway, 	and	state 	law	
generally 	imposes 	narrow 	limits 	on	borrow -
ing	by	municipalities. 	Rigorous 	implementa -
tion	 of	these	 provisions	 should	 therefore	 en-
sure	 that	 European	 obligations	 are	met.
Exemptions	 to	the	ban	on	borrowing	 by	cen-
tral	and	state 	government 	budgets 	are	per-
mitted 	in	order 	to	offset 	cyclically 	induced	
burdens 	vis-à-vis 	a	normal 	setting. 	However,	
this	hinges	 on	the	condition	 that	 comparable	
surpluses	 be	built	 up	in	good	 economic	 times	
in	order	 to	prevent	 a	sustained	 rise	in	govern -
ment	 debt	 caused	 by	the	long-term	 accumu -
lation 	of	burdens 	that	were 	deemed 	to	be	
cyclically 	induced.3	The	borrowing 	limit	on	
the	central	 government	 budget	 is	considered	
to	have	 been	 observed	 if,	after	 adjustment,	 in	
particular, 	for	cyclical 	effects, 	net	borrowing	
does 	not	exceed 	a	threshold 	of	0.35% 	of	
gross 	domestic 	product 	(GDP). 	For	state	
budgets, 	however, 	no	structural 	leeway 	for	
incurring	 debt	 is	permitted.Further	 exceptions	 can	be	made	 in	the	event	
of	specific 	emergencies 	that	are	beyond 	the	
government’s	 control	 and	place	 a	great	 strain	
on	its	budgets.	 Compared	 with	 the	previous,	
very	loosely 	defined 	exemption 	clause 	for	
averting 	a	disruption 	of	the	macroeconomic	
equilibrium,	 much	 stricter	 requirements	 now	
have	 to	be	fulfilled.	 The	statement	 of	legisla -
tive	intent 	cites	various 	examples 	of	permis -
sible 	exemptions, 	such 	as	the	severe 	eco-
nomic 	downturn 	following 	the	escalation 	of	
the	financial	 crisis	 in	autumn	 2008	 or	the	re-
unification	 of	Germany.	 The	question	 of	how	
to	treat	 the	ensuing	 debt	 in	such	 situations	 is	
at	least	 as	important	 as	establishing	 a	narrow	
definition 	of	the	exemptions 	themselves.	
While 	the	previous 	rules 	even 	allowed 	un-
used	 portions	 of	loan	 authorisations	 after	 in-
voking 	the	exemption 	clause 	to	be	drawn	
down 	for	further 	borrowing 	in	later 	years,	
the	new	 debt	 brake	 stipulates	 that	 additional	
debt	 must	 be	tied	to	explicit	 repayment	 rules.	
This	 condition	 is	designed	 to	curb	 the	incen -
tive	to	make	 excessive	 use	of	the	exemption	
clause	 and	 prevent	 a	systematic	 rise	in	debt,	
even	 though	 neither	 specific	 repayment	 peri-
ods	nor	resolutions 	on	consolidation 	meas -
ures	 are	prescribed.
In	principle, 	the	new	rules 	apply 	from 	the	
2011	 budget	 year	 onwards.	 However,	 as	large	
budgetary 	strains 	as	result 	of	the	economic

specific 	borrowing 	limits 	can	still	apply, 	not	
least 	owing 	to	some 	states’ 	very	high	starting 	
values 	for	their 	deficits. 	If	the	state 	constitu -
tions 	have 	not	been 	amended 	accordingly 	by	
then, 	the	constitutional 	ban	on	borrowing 	will	enter 	into	force 	immediately 	and	without 	
exception. 	Transitional 	assistance 	totalling 	
€800 	million 	per	year	is	planned 	for	the	par-
ticularly 	highly 	indebted 	states 	of	Berlin,

leswig-Holstein, 	which 	is	to	be	financed 	in	
equal 	part	by	central 	government 	and	the	
states 	(see	chart 	on	this	page). 	In	return, 	
these 	five	states 	must 	steadily 	reduce 	their

states 	must 	merely 	aim	to	comply 	with	the

The	new	borrowing 	limits 	are	accompanied 	
by	the	creation 	of	a	Stability 	Council 	(Article

Specifics of the debt rule for central 
 government
Basic Law
Some 	of	the	principles 	applicable 	to	the	cen-
tral	government 	budget 	were 	defined 	more 	
precisely 	in	Article 	115	II	of	the	Basic 	Law, 	
which 	also	grants 	the	authorisation 	to	flesh 	
out	the	rules 	in	an	implementation 	act.	Prior 	
to	the	reform, 	substantial 	realisations 	of	par-
ticipating 	interests 	and	loan	assets 	were 	of-
ten	used 	in	order 	to	plug 	budgetary 	gaps, 	
which 	ultimately 	eroded 	the	expenditure-
related 	borrowing 	limit. 	The	new	rules 	specify 	
that	acquisitions 	and	realisations 	of	financial 	
assets 	(eg	loans 	granted 	or	privatisation 	pro-
ceeds) 	are	not	relevant 	to	the	borrowing 	limit	
and	must 	be	factored 	out	of	the	deficits 	on	
which 	the	rule	is	based 	(see	chart 	on	this	
page 	for	realisation 	volumes 	over	the	past	
decade). 	As	financial 	transactions 	are	ex-
cluded 	under 	the	European 	budgetary 	rules 	
(which 	are	based 	on	the	national 	accounts), 	
this	is	also	an	important 	precondition 	for	the	
new	fiscal 	framework’s 	effectiveness 	in	en-
suring 	that	European 	obligations 	pursuant 	to	
Article 	109	II	of	the	Basic 	Law	are	met.
In	addition, 	it	is	to	be	ensured 	in	future 	that	
any	borrowing 	which 	exceeds 	the	ceiling 	at	
budget 	outturn 	does 	not	cause 	structural 	
debt 	to	rise.	Central 	government 	is	therefore 	
obliged 	to	keep 	a	control 	account 	that	
records 	any	divergence 	between 	actual 	bor-
rowing 	and	the	constitutional 	limit	each 	year. 	
The	ceiling 	could, 	for	example, 	be	overshot 	if	
a	borrowing 	authorisation 	from 	the	Budget 	
Act	that	entirely 	exhausts 	the	constitutional 	limit	is	used 	in	full	at	budget 	outturn 	(eg	
owing 	to	planned 	expenditure 	being 	over-
shot) 	even 	though 	the	strain 	placed 	on	the	
budget 	by	the	business 	cycle 	or	financial 	
transactions 	was	lower 	than 	projected. 	If	the	
cumulated 	debt 	on	the	control 	account 	ex-
ceeds 	1.5% 	of	GDP , 	the	corresponding 	
amounts 	are	to	be	“scaled 	back 	in	a	cyclically 	
appropriate 	fashion” 	by	keeping 	borrowing 	
below 	the	structural 	limit	of	0.35% 	of	GDP . 	
These 	provisions 	show 	that	the	debt 	brake 	
regulations 	–	unlike 	the	previous 	arrange -
ments 	–	are	to	be	binding 	not	only	during 	ex

The role of the Stability Council
Deutsche BundesbankThe reformed budgetary rules assign an important 
role to a new Stability Council, namely to monitor and 
render transparent the budgetary development and 
budget plans of both central government and the 
state governments. In particular, the aim is to avert a 
budgetary emergency of a government entity in fu-
ture before it materialises. The Council therefore has 
the power to declare that a budgetary emergency is 
imminent and to stipulate restructuring programmes 
as and when necessary. However, compliance with the 
existing or new debt rules is merely to be commented 
on in the context of the stability reports that each 
government entity must submit annually.
The Stability Council comprises the federal ministers 
of fi  nance and economics plus the state fi  nance minis-
ters; it drew up its rules of procedure in April 2010. It 
meets at least semi-annually and passes resolutions 
with a majority of at least 11 of the 16 states and the 
approval of central government, with individual en-
tities abstaining on votes regarding their own entity.
In the course of regular budgetary surveillance, cen-
tral government and the state governments submit 
annual reports on their current and planned medium-
term budgetary situation. The reports chieﬂ  y focus on 
four budgetary key fi  gures and thresholds defi  ned by 
the Stability Council. Any overrun of these values is 
interpreted as a warning signal of a looming budget 
emergency (see also the box inset opposite). In add-
ition, the government entities must draw up stand-
ardised medium-term budget projections. A differen-
tiated evaluation is only instigated once a state gov-
ernment or central government overshoots three 
thresholds twice during the recent period (the last 
two years and the current year) or twice during the 
planning period (generally the four following years) 
or the projection shows fi  gures deemed to be critical. 
Based on this evaluation, the Stability Council may, if 
necessary, declare a looming budgetary emergency 
and then agree a restructuring programme with the 
entity concerned to avert it. This programme requires 
the net borrowing volume to be reduced over a stand-
ard period of fi  ve years. To this end, the respective 
entity has to specify measures of its own to safeguard the necessary consolidation. As the state governments 
have limited revenue autonomy, their measures must 
necessarily focus on curbing expenditure. The entity in 
question must submit a semi-annual progress report 
to the Stability Council detailing its implementation 
of the measures. If the set targets are missed, how-
ever, the Council can merely make further requests. 
No sanctions are envisaged, with the result that the 
pressure to rigorously implement the consolidation 
programme may not be intense enough.
The establishment of a Stability Council and the 
strengthening of preventative budget surveillance 
using simple procedures based on a standardised 
framework, and the aspired transparency in report-
ing,1 are defi  nitely to be welcomed. They could help 
to counter the propensity to incur debt observed in 
the past.
Seen from the present perspective, however, there is a 
risk that the current approach may fall short of the 
mark. The assessment criteria might not detect prob-
lematic developments in time. Moreover, the compar-
ability of the data and their usefulness for assessing 
the current situation are signifi  cantly restricted by the 
fact that not all of the published state government 
budget plans are up to date on the reporting date. 
Although the necessary step of systematically includ-
ing off-budget funds is envisaged, it has apparently 
not been implemented to date. Another desideratum 
would be not just to list the values for the agreed key 
fi  gures in the stability reports but also to show the as-
sociated detailed standardised calculations and, in 
addition, to produce cross-state comparisons that ex-
tend beyond the agreed ratios. At the moment there 
is a partial respective information gap, which makes it 
much harder to comprehensively evaluate the current 
situation and the future development.
Current key fi  gures and thresholds only of limited use
The agreed key fi  gures for warning of a budgetary 
emergency at state government level2 seem only 
partly suited to meeting the Stability Council’s object-
ives. No cyclical adjustment procedure is used (yet) for

* The data are to be provided on the basis of the Federal Statistical Offi  ce’s multi-tier concept, ie the reporting group covers the core 
and off-budget entities, as well as other outsourced public entities. 
So long as this remains unimplemented, a case-by-case check is made on whether the threshold overshoot is due to the omission of off-budget entities. — 1 Structural fi  scal balance: fi  scal balance (on 
an accruals basis of the state tax revenue-sharing scheme), adjusted for the balance of fi  nancial transactions and cyclical effects (states: currently not cyclically adjusted; until cyclical adjustment procedure 
has been agreed, the state average is used as a comparison). Bal-
ances of asset funds (separated from the core budget) and civil ser-vant pension funds are included. — 2 Debt-fi  nancing ratio: net 
borrowing as % of total expenditure (adjusted for payments within 
the same state level). — 3 Interest-to-tax ratio: interest payments as % of tax revenue. Taxes after state tax revenue-sharing, including 
general supplementary Federal grants, mining royalties and motor 
vehicle tax offset. — 4 Debt level: credit market debt on 31 Decem-
ber. Target debt level of the year in question and of the fi  nancial 
plan period is calculated as the debt level of the previous year plus net borrowing in the year in question. — 5 Current budgetary situ-
ation: observation values = actual values of the two preceding years and the target value of the current budget year (t-2 to t). — 6 Finan-
cial plan: observation values = values according to draft budget for 
the following year and medium-term fi  nancial plan (t+1 to t+4). — 
7 Financial plan: the add-on vis-à-vis the threshold value for the current budgetary situation (ie easing) can be waived if the tax esti-mate for the current year produces markedly better results than the 
previous estimate.
Standard forecast of the medium-term budgetary development
In addition to the key fi  gures given above, a projection of 
the medium-term budgetary situation, based on stand-
ardised assumptions regarding growth and revenue, is 
presented under the budget surveillance procedure. The 
benchmark that is computed is the expenditure growth 
rate at which the debt level threshold value is marginally not exceeded at the end of a seven-year projection 
period (based on the outturn of the year prior to the re-
porting year and also on the target value of the current year). In a fi  rst step, an assessment is made as to whether the expenditure growth rate of a state is more than 3 pp 
below the average of all states and whether central gov-
ernment’s expenditure growth rate is more than 2 pp 
lower than the expenditure growth rate calculated for 
the reporting year. In a second step. the result is sub-jected to a quality check, if necessary also taking into 
consideration additional in-house projections of the en-
tity in question.
Evaluating a looming budget emergency
An evaluation of a looming budget emergency is initi-ated if in one of the two periods the threshold values of 
a majority of the key fi  gures are exceeded or the projec-tion indicates a problematic development. Data for a key 
fi  gure are considered problematic if the reference value 
is exceeded at least twice in one of the two periods.

The role of the Stability Council (cont’d)
Deutsche Bundesbankthreatened states. When the individual consolidation measures for 
non-hardship threatened states are identifi  able, the scale of these measures would then be requested by the hardship-threatened states 
– staggered over time, if necessary. — 5 Data on the share of units the fi  rst key fi  gure, the structural fi  scal balance per 
inhabitant, owing to the states’ inability to agree on a 
common procedure, and for that reason there are cur-
rently no structural balances adjusted for cyclical in-
ﬂ  uences. The second key fi  gure, the debt-fi  nancing 
ratio, includes discretionary allocations to reserves 
– fi  nanced, for example, out of higher-than-estimated 
revenue – and their equally arbitrary use. If not ad-
justed for the respective ﬂ  uctuations, the develop-
ment of this variable permits only a partial insight into 
the budgetary situation. Longer-term developments 
are reﬂ  ected in the debt-per-inhabitant fi  gure. It has 
the major drawback that it excludes cash advances. It 
might also make sense to additionally include risky 
guarantees as well as unfunded civil servant pension 
entitlements, the volume of which varies greatly from 
state to state, so as to capture present and future 
budget liabilities more fully. The last key fi  gure – the 
interest-to-tax ratio – would detect a problematic de-
velopment, such as in the debt level, only after several 
years, so that the warning, which is not triggered until 
a majority of the thresholds has been exceeded, would 
be activated only after a considerable time-lag.
The key fi  gures selected for state government are dir-
ectly related neither to the new debt rule nor to the 
investment-pegged borrowing limit, which still ap-
plies in some states and was exceeded in many budget 
plans in 2011. Although the stability reports of the in-
dividual government entities contain some general re-
marks about their current status of compliance with 
their respective constitutional borrowing limits, they 
do not elaborate on any overrun of the limits or on 
stop-gap measures taken to prevent such an overrun. 
Furthermore, there is no possibility in the reports to 
validate the robustness of the budget plans in this re-
gard. Another shortcoming is that the thresholds, es-
pecially for the medium-term planning period which 
frequently contains high global expenditure cuts and 
favourable growth scenarios, are calibrated gener-
ously, meaning that a precarious budgetary situation 
can go unnoticed by the Stability Council’s monitoring 
process for a long period. Notwithstanding the con-
stitutional requirement of a structurally balanced 
budget for state governments from 2020 that has 
been added to Germany’s Basic Law (Grundgesetz) , the states are being granted sizeable additional scope 
for annual debt growth without this needing to be 
offset by increases in fi  nancial asset acquisition. Lastly, 
taking the average of the state governments as a 
benchmark for comparisons is fraught with problems 
since the information value of compliance with the 
thresholds diminishes as more state budgets slide into 
signifi  cant defi  cits.
In addition, the validation processes are very drawn 
out (a whole year elapses between identifying a prob-
lem concerning thresholds for the key fi  gures and 
agreeing on a restructuring programme), and the pos-
sibility of fi  nancial sanctions is envisaged solely for 
states receiving consolidation aid during the transi-
tional period (withdrawal of fi  nancial assistance). 
Therefore it does not appear certain overall that 
timely and suffi  cient pressure to thoroughly consoli-
date (during the transitional period or when claiming 
exemption) and to interpret the budgetary rules sys-
tematically and properly can normally be exerted, as 
the Stability Council originally intended. Given the far 
stricter and also much clearer new debt rules, this task 
is thus likely to be assumed not by the Stability Coun-
cil, which is in principle suitable for this purpose, but 
instead by the constitutional courts, which will only 
get involved upon request.
Restructuring programmes need underpinning with 
suitable concrete measures
To date, the states that have been certifi  ed as facing 
looming budget emergencies based on data from au-
tumn 2010 are those receiving consolidation aid: Ber-
lin and Schleswig-Holstein, as well as Bremen and 
Saarland, which are in much worse fi  nancial shape. 
Berlin and Schleswig-Holstein presented (differing) 
reasons why, in their opinion, they are not facing a 
looming budget emergency, whereas Bremen and 
Saarland, which for this reason had both previously 
fi  led a suit with the Federal Constitutional Court (Bun-
desverfassungsgericht)  requesting central govern-
ment aid, had actually described their budget emer-
gencies as “extreme”. The affected states plan to 
agree a restructuring programme with the Stability 
Council – as is stipulated – in November 2011. Follow-

(weighted by their share in  expenditure) with unbalanced budgets in 
the year in question with a short explanation of state law peculiarities regarding provisions for the municipal budgets would be preferable for local governments.ing Bremen’s and Saarland’s poor restructuring track 
record since the 1990s and given in part grossly exces-
sive starting point values for the structural borrowing reduction paths, it would be important to ensure that 
not compliance with the excessive borrowing limits
3 
stated in the administrative agreements, but rather 
the reduction steps associated with these limits are 
backed up, as far as possible, by the states’ own per-
manent, effective measures.4 The ex ante specifi  cation 
of such measures several years in advance should be considered. It would also make sense to include con-
crete improvement obligations in the respective pro-
grammes to rectify any deviations from the set tar-
gets.
Meaningful key fi  gures and transparent comparisons
An extended and more detailed reporting obligation 
would seem to be desirable in respect of the data pro-
vided by the Stability Council. Both central govern-
ment and some states already give somewhat more 
detailed derivations of the key fi  gures in their reports. Besides actual fi  gures (for the individual states, as well 
as separately for the state government including and 
excluding its local government entities if possible), 
target fi  gures for the current year and for the multi-
year fi  nancial planning period would be especially in-
formative. Respective data regarding the size of the 
fi  scal balances, the revenue and expenditure totals (adjusted for transactions concerning reserves), pay-
ments on and revenues from fi  nancial transactions, tax receipts, interest expenses and payments made to 
the state tax revenue-sharing scheme would be im-portant.
Besides these data, which are necessary anyway to de-
termine the four agreed key fi  gures at the state gov-
ernment level, the disclosure of civil servant pension 
costs (in the case of central government inclusive of 
allocations to the Federal Railways Fund, post offi  ce pension fund and the statutory pension insurance 
scheme), transfers to local governments, the esti-
mated global expenditure savings and the estimated 
global additional receipts would be of particular im-
portance to enable independent observers to assess 
developments. Figures about the debt level – as set out above – at least including cash advances, would 
also be relevant.
Transparency could also be improved signifi  cantly by 
showing the margin in the target/outturn to the con-
stitutional borrowing limits.
5 Further details about the 
data adjustments derived from tax estimates after 
drafting the budget, for example, and about safety margins or corrections undertaken for expected 
changes to tax law compared with the offi  cial tax esti-
mate would also be important, and should be pre-
sented regularly, both in order to make meaningful 
comparisons and to draw up a picture of the current 
situation. These extra data, which should be given 
both as absolute amounts and as amounts per inhab-itant, would enable much more informative compari-
sons of the state government fi  nances to be made 
–  using comparative overviews, for example – and, 
by agreeing on lower alarm thresholds, would allow 
problematic developments to be detected far more 
reliably and quickly, so that valuable response time is 
not lost unnecessarily.
The data that would be required to provide the more 
detailed information outlined above should be gener-
ally available and, in some cases, are already recorded 
in other regular statistical reports, whereas outside 
observers can compile them, if at all, only with a great 
deal of effort. With an appropriately expanded data 
base and meaningful comparisons, the Stability Coun-
cil could provide a signifi  cant contribution to compre-
hensively informing the public about the fi  nancial sit-
uation and outlook in the individual states and at the 
level of central government. Rigorous and transpar-
ent monitoring would perceptibly increase public pressure in the event of looming budgetary problems 
and would provide the public, not least in the respec-
tive states, with a timely signal of imbalances and 
problematic developments requiring correction. 
Transparency with regard to medium-term planning 
could, in addition, place the discussion about fi  scal 
projects and their counterfi  nancing on a more ra-tional basis.DEUTSCHE

To	ensure 	that	the	borrowing 	limit	is	not	cir-
cumvented 	using 	off-budget 	entities,5	para-
graph 	2	of	the	former 	Article 	115	of	the	Basic 	
Law, 	which 	exempted 	special 	funds 	from 	the	
borrowing 	limit, 	was	rescinded 	(see	the	chart 	
on	this	page 	for	more 	details 	on	the	import -
ance 	of	off-budget 	entities 	to	total 	central 	
government 	debt). 	The	newly 	introduced 	Art-
icle	143d 	I	sentence 	1	of	the	Basic 	Law	also	
specifies 	that	only	those 	special 	funds’ 	re-
sidual 	borrowing 	authorisations 	already 	in	ex-
istence 	at	the	end	of	2010 	are	allowed 	to	be	
fully	utilised. 	To	ensure 	adherence 	to	the	
European 	rules 	pursuant 	to	Article 	109	II	of	
the	Basic 	Law, 	it	is	particularly 	important 	that	
the	borrowing 	limit	should 	include 	not	only	
special 	funds 	but	also	all	other 	entities 	that	
are	ascribed 	to	the	central 	government 	sub-
sector 	under 	the	European 	budgetary 	rules.6Implementation act
In	direct 	connection 	with	the	reform 	of	the	
Basic 	Law, 	an	act	implementing 	Article 	115	of	
the	Basic 	Law	(Act	115)	was	passed, 	specify -
ing	further 	details 	regarding 	the	central 	gov-
ernment 	debt 	brake. 	It	stipulates 	that	(budg -
etary) 	expenditure 	and	revenue 	titles 	for	ac-
quiring 	or	realising 	credit 	claims 	and	partici -
pating 	interests 	in	enterprises 	as	well	as	loans 	
granted 	from 	and	repaid 	to	government 	
budgets 	are	deemed 	to	be	financial 	transac -
tions 	and	are	factored 	out	of	the	debt 	brake. 	
The	statement 	of	legislative 	intent 	accompa -
nying 	the	act	emphasises 	that	this	ensures 	
that	the	borrowing 	limit	specified 	under 	the	
debt 	brake 	rules 	is	closer 	to	Maastricht 	net	
lending/borrowing,7	citing 	practicality 	as	the	
reason 	for	tying 	the	definition 	of	financial 	
transactions 	to	selected 	budgetary 	items. 	It	
would 	be	appropriate 	to	apply 	the	definitions 	
specified 	in	the	European 	budgetary 	surveil -
lance 	procedure 	to	more 	important 	cases.
Furthermore, 	Act	115	stipulates 	that	the	cycli-
cal	component 	must 	be	calculated 	as	the	
product 	of	the	output 	gap	and	budget 	sensi -
tivity. 	Act	115	grants 	the	power 	to	issue 	a	
regulation 	for	more 	detailed 	provisions. 	In	
addition 	to	requiring 	a	symmetric 	approach 	
to	accounting 	for	cyclical 	upswings 	and	
downswings, 	Act	115	states 	that	the	method 	
of	cyclical 	adjustment 	must 	essentially 	corre -
spond 	to	that	applied 	under 	the	European

be	regularly	 monitored	 and,	 where	 necessary,	
revised.
In	future,	 borrowing	 needs	 will	still,	 on	occa -
sion,	 be	higher	 than	 expected	 because	 reve-
nue	is	lower 	than 	estimated 	or	legally 	pre-
scribed 	benefits 	cost	more 	than 	projected	
and	the	respective 	budgetary 	burden 	is	not	
offset	 elsewhere.	 If	no	residual	 borrowing	 au-
thorisations	 from	 previous	 years	 are	available,	
a	supplementary	 budget	 with	 additional	 bor-
rowing	 authorisations	 is	generally	 required	 in	
such	 cases.	 The	additional	 borrowing	 require -
ment 	can	also	be	considerably 	higher 	than	
the	amount 	calculated 	as	being 	cyclically 	in-
duced 	given 	weaker-than-expected 	growth.	
In	past	tax	estimates, 	for	example, 	the	reve-
nue	outlook	 –	adjusted	 for	legislative	 changes	
made 	in	the	intervening 	period 	–	has	some -
times	 been	 reduced	 much	 further	 than	 could	
be	explained	 by	the	correction	 of	macroeco -
nomic	 assumptions.8	The	new	 rules	 stipulate	
that	borrowing 	in	supplementary 	budgets	
may	 exceed	 the	regular	 constitutional	 limit	 by	
3%	of	estimated 	tax	revenue 	(currently 	€7	
billion)	 if	the	supplementary	 budget	 does	 not	
entail 	new	measures 	that	place 	a	strain 	on	
the	budget. 	To	prevent 	such 	additional 	bor-
rowing 	from 	affecting 	the	debt 	level	in	the	
long	term, 	the	overshooting 	of	the	regular	
structural	 borrowing	 limit	 must	 be	booked	 in	
full	on	the	control	 account,	 which	 has	a	lim-
ited	balance.9
Under	 the	new	 rules,	 after	 the	closing	 date	 of	
the	budget	 the	difference	 between	 the	struc -
tural	 borrowing	 budget	 outcome	 and	its	reg-
ular	ceiling	 will	be	booked	 on	the	control	 ac-
count	 first	 on	1 March	 and	 finally	 revised	 on	1 September 	of	the	following 	year. 	Net	bor-
rowing 	is	to	be	adjusted 	for	the	actual 	net	
acquisition	 of	financial	 assets	 and	 the	actual	
cyclical 	component 	and	deducted 	from 	the	
ceiling.	 The	cyclical	 component	 is	not	fully	 re-
calculated. 	Instead, 	the	divergence 	between	
the	GDP	growth 	expected 	when 	the	budget	
was	 adopted	 and	 actual	 GDP	 growth	 is	clas-
sified	 as	entirely	 cyclically	 induced.10	Any	 ad-
ditional 	deficits 	derived 	by	multiplication 	of	
the	budget 	sensitivity 	and	the	GDP	growth	
rate	divergence 	for	the	preceding 	budget	
year	 are	therefore	 categorised	 as	cyclically	 in-
duced 	and	factored 	out.	Nonetheless, 	it	
should	 be	borne	 in	mind	 that	 supplementary	
data	 often	 lead	 to	a	re-evaluation	 of	the	me-
dium-term	 growth	 outlook,	 and	 this	fact	 has	
to	be	taken 	into	account 	when 	the	next	
budget	 is	prepared.	 The	macroeconomic	 pro-
jections	 on	which	 the	medium-term	 financial	
plans 	were 	based 	have 	mostly 	been 	revised	
downwards 	in	the	past	(see	the	chart 	on	
page 26	 for	developments	 over	 the	past	 dec-
ade). 	To	ensure 	that	cyclical 	adjustment 	is	
symmetric,	 potential	 GDP	 must	 also	 then	 be	
reduced, 	meaning 	that	a	larger 	share 	of	the	
observed 	deficits 	–	both 	retrospectively 	and	
prospectively	 –	are	classified	 as	structural.	 It	is	… expands 
borrowing scope where supplementary budgets used, …

nue	in	Germany 	and	current 	tax	policy 	issues, 	Monthly	
Report,	 October	 2008,	 pp	45-46.
9	However, 	the	Basic 	Law	does 	not	provide 	for	this	ex-
emption	 –	for	which	 there	 are	indeed	 good	 reasons	 –	for	
higher-than-expected 	borrowing 	during 	budget 	imple -
mentation. 	It	should 	therefore 	be	applied 	solely 	within

often 	overlooked 	that, 	as	for	the	aforemen -
tioned 	extensive 	and	unexpected 	tax	short -
falls	(if	they	are	not	classified 	as	being 	cycli-
cally	induced), 	structural 	gaps 	open 	up	also	in	
subsequent 	years 	that	are	not	permitted 	to	
be	absorbed 	via	the	control 	account 	and	
must 	be	closed 	in	full	when 	the	next	budget 	
is	prepared. 	Furthermore, 	it	is	stipulated 	that	
accumulated 	debt 	on	the	control 	account 	
must 	generally 	be	reduced. 	Where 	the	debt 	
level	booked 	on	the	control 	account 	exceeds 	
1 %	of	GDP , 	the	permissible 	borrowing 	limit	is	
lowered 	by	the	amount 	by	which 	the	control 	
account 	threshold 	is	exceeded, 	or	a	max-
imum 	of	0.35% 	of	GDP , 	if	GDP	growth 	is	ex-
pected 	to	be	above 	potential 	GDP	growth 	in	
that	budget 	year. 	This	constitutes 	a	tighten -
ing	of	the	rules 	compared 	with	the	ceiling 	of	
1.5% 	of	GDP	envisaged 	in	Article 	115	of	the	Basic 	Law, 	designed 	to	better 	ensure 	actual 	
compliance 	with	this	constitutional 	limit	(see	
overview 	on	page 27 	for	more 	on	the	appli -
cation 	of	the	debt 	brake).
The	new	rules 	will	enter 	into	full	force 	in	
2016. 	Until 	then, 	a	transitional 	provision 	for	
the	borrowing 	limit	(section 	9	of	Act	115)	
governing 	the	minimum 	“reduction 	of	the	
existing 	deficit” 	will	apply, 	which 	fleshes 	out	
Article 	143d 	of	the	Basic 	Law	by	defining 	the	
starting 	point 	as	“the 	structural 	deficit 	for	the	
2010 	budget 	year” 	and	specifying 	that	the	
limit	is	to	be	“reduced 	in	equal 	steps 	from 	
2011 	onwards”.
Specific aspects of central government’s 
implementation of the debt brake
In	principle, 	the	German 	debt 	brake 	is	a	very	
suitable 	instrument 	for	effectively 	restricting 	
government 	debt. 	However, 	stringent 	imple -
mentation 	and	avoidance 	of	exploiting 	loop-
holes 	for	circumventing 	the	rules 	will	ulti-
mately 	be	key	to	its	success.
The	size	of	the	borrowing 	limit	in	the	transi -
tional 	phase 	up	to	2016, 	which 	will	be	re-
duced 	in	fixed 	stages, 	essentially 	hinges 	on	
the	starting 	value 	for	the	structural 	deficit 	in	
2010. 	After 	the	budget 	plan	for	2010 	had	
been 	adopted 	in	March 	2010, 	the	economic 	
setting 	and	outlook 	steadily 	improved. 	In	
early 	summer 	last	year, 	expected 	structural 	
borrowing 	for	2010 	was	revised 	to	€53	billion

2010 	budget.11	Although 	a	much 	more 	fa-
vourable 	outcome 	was	already 	foreseeable 	
when 	the	2011 	budget 	was	adopted 	in	No-
vember 	2010, 	the	ceiling 	for	the	transitional 	
period 	was	not	adjusted 	any	further, 	and	nor	
was	the	additionally 	improved 	budget 	out-
turn, 	with	a	structural 	deficit 	of	less	than 	€40	
billion, 	taken 	into	account 	(see	chart 	on	this	
page). 	However, 	Article 	143d 	of	the	Basic 	
Law	ultimately 	requires 	the	starting 	value 	and	
thus	also	the	adjustment 	path 	to	be	lowered 	
accordingly.12	This	would 	not	jeopardise 	
budgetary 	continuity, 	since 	the	revision 	to	the	
structural 	deficit 	not	only	affects 	2010 	but	is	
also	carried 	forward 	into	subsequent 	years 	as	
a	baseline 	effect.13	By	contrast, 	the	fact	that	
the	starting 	value 	was	not	adjusted 	could 	
weaken 	the	consolidation 	path 	agreed 	in	June 	2010 	and	cause 	the	necessary 	consoli -
dation 	to	be	largely 	deferred 	to	the	future.14
However, 	keeping 	the	higher 	ceiling 	in	place 	
creates 	greater 	scope 	for	borrowing 	even 	if	it	
is	supposed 	to	be	undershot. 	Pursuant 	to	Act	
115,	the	items 	to	be	credited 	to	the	control 	
account 	amount 	to	more 	than 	€40	billion 	in	
the	years 	from 	2012 	to	2015 	alone 	under 	the	
current 	medium-term 	financial 	plan	(see	
chart 	on	page 29). 	While 	these 	credit 	items 	
cannot 	be	used 	to	project 	higher 	deficits 	in	
future 	budgets, 	they	do	allow 	negative 	devi-
ations 	to	be	offset 	during 	budget 	implemen -
tation. 	If,	for	example, 	the	effects 	of	benefit 	
increases 	or	tax	cuts	are	underestimated 	in	
the	budget, 	deficits 	can	be	offset 	using 	credit

later	starting 	point 	for	deficit 	reduction 	in	the	event 	of	
less	favourable 	general 	economic 	developments.
13	For	example, 	not	only	was	additional 	tax	revenue 	
posted 	in	2010, 	but	expectations 	for	subsequent 	years 	
were 	actually 	adjusted 	upwards 	even 	more 	strongly. 	The	
same 	is	true	of	the	positive 	developments 	on	the	labour 	
market 	and	interest 	expenditure.
14	Another 	advantage 	of	adjusting 	the	ceiling 	on	the	
basis 	of	the	2010 	budget 	outcome 	is	that	the	reduction 	
path 	would 	barely 	be	influenced 	by	any	one-off 	meas -
ures	in	the	base 	year. 	The	2010 	deficit 	was	initially 	con-
siderably 	increased 	in	structural 	terms 	(€12	billion 	in	the	
target) 	by	one-off 	transfers 	to	the	statutory 	health 	insur -
ance 	scheme 	and	the	Federal 	Employment 	Agency; 	at	
outturn, 	however, 	labour 	market 	developments, 	which 	
were 	far	better 	than 	predicted 	and	thus	substantially 	re-
duced 	the	Federal 	Employment 	Agency’s 	grant 	require -
ments, 	and	proceeds 	from 	the	auction 	of	mobile 	tele-
phone 	licences 	meant 	that	there 	was	almost 	no	one-off 	
effect 	on	balance. 	By	contrast, 	the	summer 	2010 	starting 	
value 	used 	by	the	government 	is	probably 	overstated 	by	
€5	billion 	as	a	result 	of	one-off 	measures.

cluding	 those	 from	 the	transitional	 period.	 It	
is	worth	 considering	 applying	 the	stricter	 pro-
visions 	made 	in	the	Basic 	Law, 	which 	explic -
itly	state	 that	 credit	 items	 may	 be	booked	 to	
the	control 	account 	only	when 	the	regular	
structural	 borrowing	 limit	 of	0.35%	 of	GDP	 is	
undershot,	 in	order	 to	prevent	 any	erosion	 of	
the	rule.
Another 	aspect 	of	the	rule’s 	implementation	
that	warrants 	criticism 	is	the	change 	to	the	
cyclical 	adjustment 	procedure 	during 	the	
transitional 	phase.15	Under 	the	new	proce -
dure,	 the	burdens	 classified	 as	being	 cyclically	
induced 	are	shown 	to	be	significantly 	larger	
at	the	current 	end,	meaning 	that	the	struc -
tural 	components 	of	given 	unadjusted 	defi-
cits	will	be	lower	 than	 before.	 To	ensure	 that	
the	new	procedure 	is	faithful 	to	the	regula -
tory	 intent	 behind	 the	debt	 brake,	 the	struc -
tural 	situation 	in	the	starting 	year	of	2010	
needs 	to	be	re-evaluated. 	The	fact	that	this	
correction	 has	not	yet	been	 made	 means	 that	
the	structural 	starting 	value 	is	overstated 	by	
up	to	€5	billion 	and	the	resulting 	structural	
scope	 for	borrowing	 in	the	transitional	 period	
increases	 further.	 As	this	is	not	the	only	 short -
coming	 of	the	new	 procedure	 in	the	context	
of	the	debt	 rule,	 it	would	 be	better	 to	return	
to	the	approach 	used 	for	2010.16	The	new	
procedure 	is	highly 	complex. 	In	general, 	the	
need 	for	extensive 	settings 	and	databases	
jeopardises	 the	transparency	 of	the	estimates.	
In	addition, 	the	estimation 	results 	are	elastic	
to	minor	 modelling	 choices	 that	 are	extremely	
difficult 	to	justify 	objectively, 	meaning 	that	
the	procedure	 is	comparatively	 vulnerable	 to	
manipulation. 	Furthermore, 	ongoing 	meth -
odological	 changes	 undermine	 the	real	sym-metry 	of	the	cyclical 	components 	estimated	
in	real	time.	 If	the	changes	 mean	 that	 greater	
cyclical 	burdens 	are	shown 	for	the	current	
end,	 as	has	recently	 been	 the	case,	 this	poses	
the	danger	 of	a	lasting	 rise	in	debt.	 Given	 the	
fundamental 	and	inevitable 	methodological	
difficulties	 that	 cyclical	 adjustment	 involves,	 it	
would 	be	advisable 	also	to	book 	the	cyclical	
components	 on	a	separate	 control	 account	 to	
allow 	easy	monitoring 	of	their 	broad 	match	
over	time	and,	where 	necessary, 	to	counter -

method 	chosen, 	this	would 	avoid 	a	gradual 	
additional 	build-up 	of	debt 	mislabelled 	as	be-
ing	cyclically 	induced.
Furthermore, 	a	sufficiently 	strict 	definition 	of	
financial 	transactions 	is	important 	to	ensur -
ing	the	effectiveness 	of	the	debt 	brake. 	Oth-
erwise, 	there 	is	a	danger 	that, 	given 	marked 	
budgetary 	tensions, 	payments 	will	be	catego -
rised 	as	loans 	granted 	or	acquisitions 	of	par-
ticipating 	interests 	so	that	their 	volume 	is	not	
curtailed 	by	the	deficit 	limit. 	In	extreme 	cases, 	
loans 	might 	be	used 	to	carry 	out	regular 	
spending. 	This, 	combined 	with	low	interest 	
rates 	or	even 	full	debt 	waivers, 	could 	lead	to	
substantial 	transfers 	being 	made 	outside 	of	
the	debt 	brake. 	Since 	the	statement 	of	legis-
lative 	intent 	accompanying 	the	act	specifies 	
that	financial 	transactions 	are	to	be	factored 	
out	of	the	debt 	brake 	in	order 	to	harmonise 	
German 	provisions 	with	the	European 	budg -
etary 	surveillance 	rules 	governing 	deficits, 	
and	since 	compliance 	with 	the	European 	
rules 	is	now	enshrined 	in	the	Basic 	Law, 	the	
European 	rules 	should 	ultimately 	also	apply 	
to	the	debt 	brake. 	This	means 	that	transac -
tions 	with	important 	transfer 	components 	–	
regardless 	of	their 	budgetary 	classification 	–	
and,	in	particular, 	debt 	waivers, 	which 	reduce 	
financial 	assets 	without 	affecting 	on-budget 	
payment 	flows, 	should 	be	counted 	towards 	
the	borrowing 	limits. 	In	accordance 	with	the	
legislative 	intent 	of	the	act,	only	acquisitions 	
of	financial 	assets 	with	genuine 	recoverable 	
value 	should 	be	factored 	out.
This	principle 	is	increasingly 	being 	taken 	into	
accou nt.	Capital 	injections 	for	development 	
banks, 	which 	in	recent 	years 	have 	been 	booked 	as	acquisitions 	of	participating 	inter-
ests	even 	though 	they	yielded 	no	dividends, 	
are	categorised 	as	capital 	transfers 	in	the	
2012 	draft 	budget. 	Furthermore, 	calls	on	
guarantees 	are	no	longer 	deemed 	to	be	fi-
nancial 	transactions 	in	this	draft, 	whereas 	this	
is	still	envisaged 	for	foreign 	calls	and	repay -
ments 	in	2011.
However, 	the	payment 	to	offset 	the	Federal 	
Employment 	Agency’s 	deficit 	is	still	being 	
booked 	as	a	financial 	transaction. 	The	pay-
ments 	of	€5½ 	billion 	estimated 	in	the	2011 	
budget 	are	envisaged 	as	interest-free 	loans 	
without 	a	fixed 	maturity. 	Repayments 	are	to	
be	made 	as	soon 	as	the	Federal 	Employment 	
Agency 	posts 	a	surplus. 	This	warrants 	a	criti-
cal	assessment 	if	the	contribution 	rate	to	the	
Federal 	Employment 	Agency 	is	not	high 	
enough 	across 	one	business 	cycle 	to	ensure 	
that	revenue 	covers 	expenditure. 	Legislators 	
at	central 	government 	level	can	strongly 	in-
fluence 	the	Federal 	Employment 	Agency’s 	fi-
nancial 	situation 	themselves 	(see	the	chart 	on	
page 31). 	In	order 	to	counterfinance 	the	re-
form 	of	social 	welfare 	basic 	allowances 	
adopted 	at	the	beginning 	of	2011, 	central 	
government’s 	VAT-funded 	payments 	to	the	
Federal 	Employment 	Agency 	are	to	be	re-
duced 	by	a	similar 	amount 	(around 	€4	billion 	
in	2014). 	This	constitutes 	a	cut	in	spending 	
on	the	Federal 	Employment 	Agency 	that	
counts 	towards 	the	debt 	brake. 	This	expendi -
ture	is	to	be	replaced 	where 	necessary 	by	a	
central 	government 	loan	to	offset 	the	agen -
cy’s	deficit, 	which 	is	categorised 	as	a	financial 	
transaction. 	Under 	the	debt 	brake 	rules, 	there 	
is	a	strong 	incentive 	for	such 	reforms. 	As	a

tribution 	rate	to	the	Federal 	Employment

costs	 without	 major	 benefit	 cuts.17	Categoris -

There	 is	a	danger	 of	a	cumulating	 volume	 of	
debt	 outside	 the	debt	 brake’s	 reach.
To	be	effective,	 the	debt	 brake	 also	 needs	 to	
encompass 	debt-like 	burdens 	outside 	of	the

following	 strong	 public	 criticism.	 Article	 143d	of	the	Basic	 Law	 closed	 this	loophole	 with	 ef-

wise	be	analysed 	critically. 	As	in	the	European 	
rules 	for	calculating 	the	Maastricht 	deficit, 	
their 	investment 	volume 	should 	be	recorded 	
as	having 	an	impact 	on	the	deficit 	if	the	gov-
ernment 	bears 	the	relevant 	project 	risks. 	
Moreover, 	including 	such 	projects 	in	the	debt 	
brake 	could 	help	to	ensure 	that	decisions 	to	
initiate 	PPP	projects 	are	indeed 	based 	on	
cost-efficiency 	gains.
By	their 	very	nature, 	strict 	borrowing 	limits 	
limit	budgetary 	flexibility 	in	respect 	of	debt-

with	borrowing 	limits 	even 	in	difficult 	circum -
stances 	without 	the	need 	for	erratic 	adjust -
ments, 	it	is	generally 	highly 	advisable 	to	fac-
tor	in	a	safety 	margin 	below 	the	ceiling. 	This	
problem 	is	underscored, 	in	particular, 	by	the	
substantial 	estimation 	uncertainty 	regarding 	
tax	revenue 	developments. 	Even 	excluding 	
effects 	resulting 	from 	legislative 	changes, 	
which 	often 	entail 	estimation 	uncertainty, 	
fluctuations 	in	revenue 	are	only	partly 	classi -
fied	as	cyclically 	induced 	under 	the	usual 	cy-
clical 	adjustment 	procedures.19	If	there 	is	no	
safety 	margin 	below 	the	constitutional 	bor-
rowing 	limit, 	unexpectedly 	poor 	structural 	tax	
revenue 	developments 	rapidly 	trigger 	a	sub-
stantial 	need 	for	consolidation.20	During 	the	
implementation 	of	a	budget, 	substantial 	ad-
ditional 	burdens 	can	occasionally 	be	ab-
sorbed 	through 	residual 	borrowing 	authori -
sations 	or,	where 	necessary, 	through 	a	sup-
plementary 	budget 	with	an	expanded 	credit 	
line.	But	this	does 	not	apply 	to	the	prepara -
tion	of	the	next	regular 	budget, 	which 	must 	
comply 	with	the	strict 	debt 	brake 	rules. 	The	
short-term 	measures 	then 	needed 	to	keep 	
borrowing 	below 	the	ceiling 	may	have 	a	pro-cyclical 	impact, 	however. 	Taking 	a	more 	am-
bitious 	strategic 	focus 	–	which 	is	necessary 	to	
ensure 	a	sufficient 	safety 	margin 	–	can	pre-
vent	such 	acute 	pressure 	for	action 	from 	aris-
ing.	A	worse-than-expected 	structural 	devel -
opment 	can	then 	be	absorbed 	by	the	safety 	
cushion, 	keeping 	borrowing 	below 	the	ceil-
ing.	Yet	even 	aside 	from 	the	problem 	of	neg-
ative 	shocks, 	introducing 	a	safety 	margin 	that	
would 	normally 	be	adhered 	to	would 	also	
usefully 	serve 	to	speed 	up	the	reduction 	of	
the	high	debt 	ratio.21

for	the	transitional	 phase	 are	planned,	 these	
too	should 	be	specified 	in	keeping 	with	the	
aim	of	rigorously	 curbing	 deficits.
In	spring 	2011, 	the	five	states 	receiving 	con-

agreements 	with 	central 	government 	con-
taining	 rules	 to	mark	 out	the	deficit	 reduction

Implementing the debt rules in the German states
Deutsche BundesbankWhereas the debt brake for central government 
has been applicable since the budget year 2011, 
state governments can keep their existing differing 
state-specifi  c rules – ie investment-related borrow-
ing limits – or enact new rules in line with the 
adopted debt brake up to the end of 2019. In the 
event that state law is not adjusted, however, new 
borrowing will be strictly prohibited without ex-
ception from 2020 onwards. Against this backdrop, 
four German states have already changed their 
constitutions by incorporating the ban on new bor-
rowing as of 2020 with some exemption clauses re-
ﬂ  ecting the provisions set out in Germany's Basic 
Law ( Grundgesetz ).After proposals for reform had failed to gain the 
necessary parliamentary majorities in North Rhine-
Westphalia and Thuringia among others, Schleswig- 
 Holstein was the fi  rst state to act in May 2010.1 Be-
sides an exception for cyclically induced defi  cits, an 
emergency clause was introduced which, to pre-
vent it from being invoked too frequently, requires 
a two-thirds voting majority in the state parlia-
ment. As Schleswig-Holstein is receiving consolida-
tion aid, it additionally resolved to incorporate a 
defi  cit reduction path in its constitution according 
to which the borrowing limit – based on the struc-
tural fi  scal balance of 2010 – declines annually by 
one-tenth of the starting value as of 2011. How-
ever, the reduction path was initially alleviated, not

cember 2010 through a one-off transfer of free 
funds in the amount of €60 million – available due 
to lower-than-planned interest expenditure – in or-
der to promote the expansion of childcare, which 
inﬂ  ated the defi  cit reduction path's starting value 
by the aforementioned sum to a total of €1.3 bil-lion. Although the statutory implementation provi-sions still need to be specifi  ed, article 53V of the 
state constitution implies that, besides an adjust-
ment for fi  nancial transactions, a control account is 
also scheduled to be introduced. However, the pub-
licly available information does not spell out how the cyclical component of net borrowing indicated in the budget plan for 2011 and 2012 was deter-
mined. Hence it cannot be cross-checked to what 
extent the constitutional requirement to reduce 
the structural defi  cit is actually fulfi  lled in the 
budget.
2
Rhineland-Palatinate, too, changed its constitution in December 2010. The rule closely follows the pro-
visions in the Basic Law and additionally stipulates 
a steady reduction in the structural defi  cit until 2019, although annual reduction targets are not 
specifi  ed. However, besides the exceptions listed in 
article 109 of the Basic Law, an exemption from the ban on new borrowing, coupled with redemption 
provisions and limited to a maximum of four years, 
may be applied in the event that a legislative change not attributable to the state parliament 
leads to strains on revenue or expenditure. This in-
cludes measures introduced by the Bundesrat (Ger-many’s upper house of parliament composed of 
government representatives of all the states) as 
Rhineland-Palatinate considers that it has “no di-rect inﬂ  uence” on such legislation.
4 It is questiona-
ble, however, whether this rule will be compatible 
with the provisions of the Basic Law as of 2020. 
Against the backdrop of the provisions aimed at complying with European rules stated in article 
109II of the Basic Law, the provision in article 117III 
of the state constitution logically states that the debt brake also applies to some entities beyond the 
core budget. Whether the selected criteria are suf-
fi  ciently in line with the defi  nitions outlined in the 
Basic Law remains to be seen when implemented.
In a referendum held in March 2011 on a draft 
amendment approved by the state parliament, the 
inhabitants of Hesse voted for the introduction of a 
debt brake in their state constitution. The principal provisions are closely modelled on those in the Ba-
sic Law. In addition, a broad majority of the state 
parliament has already agreed on a number of key points for the implementation act which is yet to 
be fi  nalised.
5 An adjustment of revenue and ex-
penditure fi  gures for fi  nancial transactions and a transparent cyclical adjustment procedure – the de-
tails of which remain to be specifi  ed – as well as a kind of control account in line with the arrange-
ments at central government level are being envis-
aged. Options for new borrowing by off-budget entities are coupled to a legal exception – yet to be 
enacted for this purpose – which could be regarded 
as a starting point for substantially limiting the ef-fectiveness of the debt brake.
At the end of June 2011, Mecklenburg-West Pomer-
ania also adopted a constitutional reform which as-sumes the provisions of the Basic Law. In this case, 
too, the corresponding implementation acts are 
still to be completed. Given Mecklenburg-West Po-merania's good starting position in terms of its fi  s-
cal balance, the state government budget essen-
tially only needs adjusting for the running down of the comprehensive special supplementary Federal 
grants to the east German states, which is to be 
completed by 2020.
A constitutional amendment is also under consid-
eration in other states such as Lower Saxony. The draft amendment in Lower Saxony foresees 2017 as 
the starting date for the general ban on new bor-
rowing. A linear reduction path is envisaged for 
tion. — 2 For critical comments on the creation of an artifi  cially high

Implementing the debt rules in the German states (cont'd)
Deutsche Bundesbankthe transitional period, although the choice of the 
high 2011 budget target fi  gure as the starting point 
for net borrowing is likely to reduce the adjust-
ment pressure in the fi  rst few years. If fi  rst applied 
in 2012, the new rules would actually create greater 
scope for borrowing than the old constitutional 
limit.
Those states currently receiving consolidation aid 
appear to see no urgent need for further legislative 
initiatives over and above the administrative agree-
ments concluded in spring 2011 given that those 
agreements already specify the defi  cit reduction 
path (based on prescribed calculation methods), 
compliance with which is a prerequisite for the dis-
bursement of consolidation aid pursuant to article 
143 (d) of the Basic Law.6 Besides the cyclical adjust-
ment procedure, the provisions regulate the step-
by-step minimum reduction of the initial budget 
defi  cit adjusted for fi  nancial transactions. Here, 
too, the starting point values are inﬂ  ated, particu-
larly through their referencing to the low tax esti-
mate fi  gures of May 2010, which considerably alle-
viates consolidation pressure at the current end 
(“ski jump”). This is problematic as experience has 
shown that commitments regarding future defi  cit 
reduction are often ignored. Despite compliance 
with the provisions stipulated in the administrative 
agreement, an overshooting of the still unchanged 
constitutional borrowing limit, which is pegged to 
the level of new investment, occurred in the case of 
Bremen in 2011. For an interim period, this was ex-
plicitly approved by the state constitutional court 
in order to overcome an extreme budgetary situa-
tion.7 In the context of such an interpretation of 
the constitutional rules, great importance is attrib-
uted to strict adherence to the – initially rather un-
ambitious – defi  cit ceilings throughout the transi-
tional period.
Instead of a constitutional reform, six states (Baden-
Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia) have adopted a general le-
gal ban on new borrowing in their state budgetary 
regulation laws, some of which have already been 
implemented. The derogations are often more 
generous compared with the reformed state con-
stitutions mentioned above, given that they also 
include revenue shortfalls that exceed a certain 
threshold (Baden Württemberg, Saxony, Thur-
ingia). Hence, full compliance with the provisions 
stipulated by the Basic Law as of 2020 appears not 
to be assured beyond all doubt. Moreover, the ban 
on new borrowing in the state budgetary regula-
tion law – as opposed to the state constitution – 
can be suspended by an additional law during the 
transitional period and thus provides far less pro-
tection from soaring state budget indebtedness.
Examples of a ban on new borrowing contained in 
the state budgetary regulation laws already being 
evaded in practice can be found in Bavaria and 
Baden-Württemberg. A supplementary budget 
adopted by Bavaria in 2008 contained a borrowing 
authorisation of €10 billion to recapitalise  Bayern 
Landesbank, which was stricken by the fi  nancial cri-
sis. However, instead of invoking the state budget-
ary regulation law's clause on exceptional circum-
stances to justify this action, the state lawmakers 
merely cited extraordinary need in line with article 
82 of the state constitution, thereby overriding the 
legal rules. Although the government of Baden-
Württemberg that was newly elected in spring 2011 
promised to achieve considerable consolidation 
progress during the current legislative period and 
to illustrate the actual magnitude of the state's in-
debtedness by a comparison with asset accounts in 
future, it appears to have no plans at the moment 
to enshrine the debt brake in the state constitu-
tion. Moreover, the fourth supplementary budget 
of 2011 indicates virtually no consolidation efforts: 
the budget volume is on the rise and, despite the 
existing ban on new borrowing, the budget contin-
ues to be balanced through loans, although the 
cipient of consolidation aid. — 4 See the memorandum of the draft 
act: Landtag Rheinland-Pfalz, printed matter 15/4966, p 7. — 5 See Hessischer Landtag, printed matter 18/3492. — 6 Meanwhile, the

prerequisites for an exception prescribed by the 
state budgetary regulation law manifestly no 
longer apply.8 Prior to this, however, the borrowing 
cap rule – which was established without excluding fi  nancial transactions – had already been circum-
vented by setting up special-purpose entities out-side the budget as vehicles for borrowing. Baden-
Württemberg used this loophole for the fi  rst time 
in 2009 when Landesbank Baden-Württemberg was supported by a capital increase which, in the 
amount of €2 billion, was debt-fi  nanced by an en-
tity backed by a state guarantee and assignable to the government sector according to the Maastricht 
Treaty defi  nition. In addition to this, Baden-
Württemberg granted guarantees in connection with the establishment of a risk shield totalling €12½ billion which impacted on the Maastricht 
debt level. At the end of 2010, Baden-Württemberg also decided to purchase a sizeable shareholding in the regional energy utility through a state enter-
prise for which guarantees of up to €6 billion were made available. This, too, may be expected to have 
a major impact on the government debt level as 
defi  ned in the Maastricht Treaty. In general it must 
be said that debt arising from  fi  nancial transactions 
to acquire shares in fi  nancially sound enterprises 
could legitimately have been deducted from the 
borrowing limit under the terms of the debt brake 
incorporated into the Basic Law. Yet quite apart from the concrete classifi  cation applicable to the 
transactions mentioned above, the state budgetary 
regulation law does not provide for this. It also re-mains to be seen to what extent the state will actu-
ally comply with the statutory requirement to pay 
down debt incurred by invoking the exemption clause in the case of tax revenue shortfalls.

avoid 	creating 	a	“ski	jump 	effect” 	by	apply -
ing	an	overly 	high	starting 	value, 	thus	defer -

likewise 	use	the	current 	favourable 	condi -
tions 	to	achieve 	the	aim	of	a	structurally 	bal-
anced 	budget 	as	soon 	as	possible 	instead 	of	
delaying 	consolidation 	until	the	last	few	years 	
before 	the	transitional 	period 	expires. 	Given 	
the	strict 	constitutional 	provisions, 	it	would 	
be	highly 	advisable 	for	the	states, 	too,	to	fac-
tor	in	ample 	safety 	margins.
Outlook and conclusions
The	new	debt 	brake 	for	central 	and	state 	
government 	should 	eliminate 	the	most 	im-
portant 	weaknesses 	in	the	former 	borrowing 	
limit. 	The	investment-related 	rule,	which 	was	
susceptible 	to	limitations 	in	its	effectiveness, 	
has	been 	replaced 	by	the	obligation 	to	at	
least 	achieve 	a	structurally 	close-to-balance 	
or	fully	balanced 	budget. 	Unlike 	before, 	the	
provisions 	are	also	targeted 	unequivocally 	at	
the	phase 	of	budget 	implementation. 	In	ad-
dition, 	there 	are	now	far	fewer 	possibilities 	
for	exploiting 	exemptions 	which 	were 	used 	
to	circumvent 	the	old	rules; 	the	obligation 	to	
adopt 	a	repayment 	schedule 	for	the	debts 	ex-
empted 	from 	the	rule	is	particularly 	impor -
tant	in	this	respect. 	Finally, 	the	possibility 	of	
circumventing 	the	borrowing 	limit	via	central 	
government 	special 	funds 	has	also	been 	elim-
inated.
The	rules 	are	essentially 	a	very	suitable 	instru -
ment 	for	halting 	and	reversing 	the	previous 	
strong 	and	almost 	continuous 	rise	in	the	gen-eral	government 	debt 	ratio. 	Central 	and	state 	
government 	deficits 	have 	developed 	very	fa-
vourably 	this	year, 	particularly 	as	a	result 	of	
the	unexpectedly 	positive 	macroeconomic 	
setting. 	However, 	we	should 	be	under 	no	illu-
sions: 	relatively 	large-scale 	consolidation 	is	
still	needed, 	the	debt 	ratio 	is	very	high	and,	in	
particular, 	demographic 	developments 	are	
set	to	create 	budgetary 	burdens 	in	the	future. 	
The	new	borrowing 	rule,	too,	is	likely 	to	have 	
had	a	positive 	impact 	on	current 	fiscal 	devel -
opments. 	Nonetheless, 	adherence 	to	such 	
rules 	under 	unexpectedly 	favourable 	circum -
stances 	is	hardly 	the	acid	test.	Indeed, 	it	is	
important 	to	use	good 	times 	as	an	opportu -
nity	for	rapid 	consolidation 	and	to	ensure 	
that	the	rules 	are	consistently 	obeyed 	even 	
under 	difficult 	circumstances.
Some 	recent 	experiences 	sound 	a	note 	of	
caution 	and	suggest 	that	regular 	political 	
practice 	may	tend 	towards 	less-than-stringent 	
interpretations 	of	the	rule.	In	particular, 	the	
fact	that	the	starting 	value 	for	the	central 	
government 	structural 	borrowing 	limit	set	for	
the	transitional 	phase 	from 	2011 	to	2015 	is	
overly 	high	is	evidence 	of	a	rather 	unambi -
tious 	approach. 	To	effectively 	ensure 	that	the	
regulatory 	intent 	is	put	into	effect, 	it	is	also	
important 	to	properly 	define 	the	financial 	
transactions 	that	are	factored 	out	of	the	debt 	
brake. 	While 	clear 	improvements 	have 	re-
cently 	been 	made 	in	this	area, 	the	classifica -
tion	of	the	payment 	to	offset 	the	Federal 	Em-
ployment 	Agency’s 	deficit, 	for	example, 	
should 	be	reappraised. 	It	is	also	crucial 	to	use	
a	transparent 	cyclical 	adjustment 	procedure 	
and	avoid 	a	gradual 	rise	in	debt 	that	is	classi -
fied	as	cyclically 	induced. 	Documenting 	the	Debt brake can

cumulated	 cyclical	 burdens	 could	 help	 in	ex-

Some 	states 	have 	already 	enshrined 	a	debt	
brake	 in	their	 constitutions,	 or	at	least	 in	their	
budgetary 	regulation 	laws. 	However, 	it	re-
mains	 to	be	seen,	 not	least	 given	 the	lack	 of

the	debt	 brake	 stipulated	 in	the	Basic	 Laws	 is	
ultimately	 put	into	 practice.	 In	addition,	 some	
states	 appear	 to	be	delaying	 adjustment.	 This	
puts	the	achievement 	of	a	balanced 	budget

riod	 is	deemed	 impossible	 because,	 for	exam -
ple,	it	coincides 	with	an	unfavourable 	macr -
oeconomic	 setting.	 The	manner	 in	which	 the	
budgetary	 problems	 of	states	 with	 especially	
high	 budget	 deficits	 have	 been	 addressed	 to	
date	has	certainly 	been 	less	than 	encourag -
ing.	The	creation 	of	the	Stability 	Council,	
which 	is	tasked 	with	preventing 	budgetary	
emergencies, 	is	therefore 	essentially 	a	wel-
come	 development	 and	may	 make	 a	key	con-
tribution	 towards	 safeguarding	 sound	 public	
finances.	 However,	 there	 is	a	danger	 that	 the	ratios 	and	reference 	values 	it	uses	will	not	
flag	up	looming 	budgetary 	emergencies 	at	
an	early	 stage.	 In	addition,	 there	 are	only	 lim-
ited	possibilities 	for	imposing 	sanctions 	on	
states	 whose	 deficit	 reduction	 is	found	 to	be	
insufficient.	 More	 detailed,	 directly	 compara -
ble	information	 could	 be	provided	 in	order	 to	
ensure	 transparency	 regarding	 the	budgetary	
situation	 and	 budget	 plans	 for	the	individual	
governments.	 This	 could	 perceptibly	 enhance	
the	monitoring	 and	 safeguarding	 of	budget -
ary	discipline	 agreed	 under	 the	debt	 brake.
Not	least 	given 	the	importance 	of	the	Ger-
man	debt 	brake 	as	a	benchmark 	within 	the	
euro	 area,	 it	is	crucial	 that	 it	is	implemented	
rigorously	 and	 in	a	manner	 that	 is	true	 to	its	
intention.	 A	certain	 fiscal	 policy	 reserve	 buffer	
deemed 	necessary 	for	dealing 	with 	unex -
pected	 developments	 can	be	created	 by	fac-
toring 	in	safety 	margins 	below 	the	constitu -
tional	 borrowing	 limit.	 It	would	 be	advisable	
to	apply 	this	precaution 	to	the	transitional	
period, 	too.	 The	reduced 	interest 	burden 	re-
sulting 	from 	rigorous 	consolidation 	will	give	
fiscal	 policymakers	 greater	 room	 to	manoeu -

Germany’s external position against the 
 background of increasing economic policy 
 surveillance
In	response 	to	the	financial 	and	economic 	crisis, 	efforts 	have 	been 	undertaken 	at	the	European 	
and	global 	level	alike 	to	intensify 	existing 	economic 	policy 	coordination. 	The	idea	behind 	EU	
economic 	governance 	and	the	G20	Mutual 	Assessment 	Process 	(MAP) 	is	to	assess 	the	sustain -
ability 	of	economic 	developments. 	The	European 	surveillance 	procedure 	will	begin 	with	an	early 	
warning 	system 	on	the	basis 	of	selected 	indicators. 	The	present 	article 	outlines 	methodologies 	
for	identifying 	benchmarks 	which 	can	be	used 	to	define 	a	sustainable 	external 	position. 	If	signs 	
of	potential 	or	existing 	imbalances 	are	confirmed 	as	the	result 	of	a	detailed 	country 	analysis, 	
recommendations 	that	prompt 	the	affected 	economies 	to	undertake 	economic 	policy 	reform 	
should 	be	issued. 	Empirical 	studies 	by	the	Bundesbank 	have 	shown 	that	the	saving 	and	invest -
ment 	decisions 	which 	lurk	“behind 	the	current 	account” 	can	be	influenced 	only	moderately 	by	
market-conforming 	economic 	policy 	measures. 	In	addition, 	time	lags	make 	it	difficult 	to	at-
tribute 	the	effects 	clearly 	to	the	current 	account.
With 	regard 	to	Germany, 	the	current 	account 	surplus 	has	come 	under 	criticism. 	The	surveillance 	
procedure 	could 	additionally 	fuel	this	criticism 	if	–	as	is	looking 	ever	more 	likely 	–	positive 	current 	
account 	positions 	are	also	seen 	as	an	indication 	of	potentially 	unsound 	developments. 	However, 	
it	should 	be	noted 	that	Germany’s 	high	net	savings 	by	international 	standards 	–	unlike 	current 	
account 	deficits 	–	do	not	result 	in	payment 	obligations 	which, 	if	not	met, 	would 	put	other 	coun -
tries	or	the	stability 	of	monetary 	union 	at	risk.
The	current 	account 	balance 	and	external 	position 	are	ultimately 	not	independent 	economic 	
policy 	targets 	but	instead 	the	result 	of	numerous, 	largely 	private-sector 	decisions 	at	home 	and	
abroad. 	However, 	taken 	together, 	these 	could 	lead	to	unsustainable 	developments 	which 	would 	
hamper 	the	ability 	of	European 	monetary 	union 	to	function 	and	increase 	the	vulnerability 	of	the	
international 	capital 	markets. 	On	the	other 	hand, 	given 	the	diagnostic 	problems 	described 	above 	
and	the	limited 	efficacy 	of	economic 	policy 	measures, 	a	balance 	needs 	to	be	struck 	between 	
justified 	intervention 	in	order 	to	avert 	risks	to	the	stability 	of	other 	economies 	or	the	euro 	area	
as	a	whole 	and	economic 	fine-tuning, 	which 	needs 	to	be	avoided.DEUTSCHE

sistently 	and	steadily 	growing 	apart 	since 	the	
mid-1990s. 	Whereas 	since 	the	turn	of	the	
millennium 	not	only	Germany 	but	also	Aus-
tria,	Belgium, 	Finland, 	the	Netherlands 	and

some 	newer 	central 	and	east	European 	mem -
bers	of	the	euro 	area, 	has	risen 	sharply.
Even 	in	a	monetary 	union, 	disparities 	in	mac-
roeconomic 	developments 	are	not	in	and	of	
themselves 	indicative 	of	growing 	imbalances. 	
For	example, 	it	appears 	fundamentally 	quite 	
justifiable 	for	countries 	that	have 	an	increas -
ingly 	ageing 	population 	and	a	high	per	capita 	
income 	to	have 	a	higher 	saving 	ratio 	than 	
countries 	with 	a	growing 	population 	and	
less-well-developed 	economies 	which 	are	
funding 	their 	consumption 	and	investment 	in	
part	by	borrowing 	from 	other 	countries, 	in	
expectation 	of	a	rapid 	and	extended 	conver -
gence 	process.3
Moreover, 	the	increased 	integration 	of	finan -
cial	markets 	has	also	led	to	diverging 	invest -
ment 	trends. 	The	provision 	of	capital 	where 	
investors 	expect 	it	to	earn 	the	highest 	mar-
ginal 	returns 	and	the	resulting 	pronounced 	
investment 	activity 	in	southern, 	central 	and	
eastern 	Europe 	are	fundamentally 	consistent 	
with	standard 	economic 	thinking.
However, 	even 	before 	the	financial 	crisis 	
broke 	out,	the	dimensions 	of	the	current 	ac-
count 	deficits 	in	conjunction 	with	the	accu -
mulated 	net	external 	debt 	of	some 	countries 	
led	some 	to	ask	to	what 	extent 	these 	bal-
ances 	are	sustainable 	and	truly 	consistent 	
with	the	need 	to	fund 	the	catching-up 	pro-
cess. 	Studies 	have 	presented 	evidence 	of	
shifts 	in	euro-area 	countries’ 	current 	account 	
positions, 	in	some 	cases 	far	beyond 	levels 	
that	can	be	explained 	by	real	economic 	con-
vergence 	alone.4The	financial 	crisis 	exposed 	these 	imbalances, 	
forcing 	the	affected 	countries 	to	adjust, 	in	
some 	cases 	considerably.5	However, 	the	re-
duction 	in	the	current 	account 	deficits 	was	
also	partly 	due	to	the	cyclical 	slowdown; 	a	
fundamental, 	long-term 	weakening 	of	the	
disparities 	is	therefore 	not	yet	assured. 	It	
would 	also	be	much 	easier 	to	undertake 	the	
necessary 	adjustments 	if	the	supply 	side	were 	
strengthened 	to	make 	up	for	the	unavoidable 	
cutback 	in	domestic 	demand. 	In	this	respect, 	
the	outcome 	is	mixed: 	while 	some 	deficit 	
countries 	have 	already 	started 	to	see	their 	
competitiveness 	improve 	considerably, 	in	
other 	countries 	the	causes 	of	the	pre-crisis 	
distortions 	are	still	in	place. 	Without 	exten -
sive	structural 	reforms, 	the	imbalances 	are	
threatening 	to	rise	once 	again 	as	economic 	
recovery 	progresses.

at European and global level
There 	is	a	broad 	political 	consensus 	at	the	Eu-
ropean 	and	global 	level 	that	a	renewed 	
build-up 	of	imbalances 	needs 	to	be	pre-

lished 	the	Van	Rompuy 	task	force 	with	the	
goal	of	developing 	a	European 	surveillance 	
procedure 	to	identify 	at	an	early 	stage, 	and	
help	to	correct, 	macroeconomic 	imbalances 	
and	shifts 	in	competitiveness.6	At	the	global 	
level, 	the	G20, 	under 	the	MAP , 	has	created 	
guidelines 	which 	are	likewise 	designed 	to	
identify 	external 	imbalances 	and	reduce 	them 	
to	a	sustainable 	level.7
Both 	sets	of	measures 	are	intended 	to	obtain 	
the	most 	comprehensive 	picture 	of	potential 	
risks	possible 	while 	at	the	same 	time	keeping 	
the	surveillance 	mechanism 	simple 	and	trans -
parent. 	The	two	procedures 	share 	many 	
things 	in	common. 	However, 	the	underlying 	
legal 	frameworks, 	as	well	as	the	powers 	of	
the	bodies 	responsible 	for	setting 	up	and	im-
plementing 	these 	procedures, 	are	not	com-
parable. 	Since 	the	EU	process 	has	much 	more 	
ambitious 	aims 	and	is	likely 	to	entail 	further-
reaching 	consequences 	for	Germany, 	the	
present 	article 	will	focus 	on	the	planned 	
European 	surveillance 	procedure.
At	European 	level, 	a	six-part 	package 	of	leg-
islation, 	called 	the	“six	pack”, 	was	approved 	
by	the	Council 	of	the	European 	Union 	on	
4 October 	2011.8	This	legislation 	provides 	not	
only	for	a	reform 	of	the	Stability 	and	Growth 	
Pact	but	also	stronger 	surveillance 	over	na-
tional 	economic 	policy.9	The	European 	Parlia -
ment 	had	previously 	already 	approved 	the	
package 	of	measures. 	The	responsible 	bodies 	
are	discussing 	the	further 	details 	of	the	sur-
veillance 	procedure.10
The	first	step	in	EU	economic 	governance 	is	
to	monitor 	economies 	based 	on	a	small 	set	of	macroeconomic 	variables. 	In	the	near	future, 	
the	Commission 	intends 	to	finalise 	a	cata-
logue 	of	indicators 	which 	follows 	the	guid-
ance 	provided 	by	the	adopted 	legislation. 	The

ruary 	2011, 	details 	of	the	early 	warning 	mechanism, 	such 	
as	the	choice 	of	indicator, 	were 	formulated. 	The	indica -
tors	to	be	examined 	include 	public 	debt, 	fiscal 	deficits,

ther	on	market 	exchange 	rates 	or	purchasing 	power

the	IMF	Spring 	Meeting 	in	April 	2011 	on	methodological 	
approaches 	to	calculating 	the	benchmarks 	for	the	early 	
warning 	indicators. 	These 	guidelines 	will	contain 	not	
only	a	structural, 	ie	econometric, 	approach 	but	also	sta-
tistical 	methods. 	Agreement 	on	further 	steps, 	especially 	
sustainability 	analyses 	for	those 	economies 	which 	have 	
been 	flagged 	by	the	early 	warning 	system, 	and	the	ac-

step	has	found 	signs 	of	potential 	imbalances. 	
This	can	also	imply 	“missions” 	to	the	affected 	
countries. 	The	idea	is	that, 	at	this	stage 	of	the	
procedure, 	specific 	national 	developments 	
and	characteristics 	of	individual 	economies 	
are	factored 	into	the	sustainability 	analysis. 	
This	enables 	a	decision 	on	whether 	the	po-
tential 	disequilibria 	identified 	in	the	first	stage 	
actually 	need 	to	be	regarded 	as	problematic.
If	there 	are	significant 	signs 	of	future 	imbal -
ances, 	the	Council 	–	on	the	basis 	of	recom -
mendations 	by	the	Commission 	–	will	direct 	
economic 	policy 	recommendations 	for	“pre -
ventive 	action” 	to	the	country 	in	question. 	If	
there 	is	sound 	evidence 	that	serious 	macro -
economic 	imbalances 	either 	exist	or	are	de-
veloping, 	including 	those 	that	jeopardise 	the	
smooth 	functioning 	of	the	entire 	economic 	
and	monetary 	union, 	an	“excessive 	imbal -
ance 	procedure” 	is	launched. 	The	countries 	
whose 	economies 	are	affected 	are	conse -
quently 	given 	a	specific 	deadline 	within 	which 	
to	develop 	and	present 	a	“corrective 	action 	
plan”, 	compliance 	with	which 	is	monitored 	
based 	on	an	agreed 	“roadmap”.
This	corrective 	element 	of	the	surveillance 	
procedure 	applies 	to	all	EU	member 	states; 	
however, 	only	euro-area 	member 	states 	can	
be	punished 	by	sanctions 	for	non-compliance. 	
The	approach 	is	two-fold. 	First-time 	offend -
ers	in	breach 	of	the	agreed 	measures 	are	re-
quired 	to	pay	an	interest-bearing 	deposit. 	
The	second 	breach 	is	punishable 	by	convert -
ing	the	interest-bearing 	deposit 	into	a	fine	(of	
up	to	0.1 % 	of	GDP). 	These 	procedures 	are	
adopted 	by	what 	is	known 	as	“reverse 	quali -
fied	majority 	voting”: 	a	recommendation 	is	regarded 	as	adopted 	if	it	is	not	rejected 	by	a	
qualified 	majority 	of	member 	states.13
One	topic 	of	controversy 	during 	the	negotia -
tions 	was	whether 	external 	surpluses 	should 	
be	regarded 	as	imbalances 	to	the	same 	ex-
tent	that	deficits 	are.	Current 	account 	sur-
pluses 	lead	to	an	accumulation 	of	external 	
assets. 	Unlike 	deficits, 	however, 	claims 	on	
non-residents 	do	not	create 	any	payment 	ob-
ligations. 	They 	therefore 	do	not	amplify 	the	
risk	of	default 	or	a	national 	balance 	of	pay-
ments 	crisis 	with	negative 	spillover 	to	other 	
countries. 	It	is	not	least 	for	this	reason 	that	
the	net	external 	assets 	criterion 	does 	not	ap-
pear 	to	be	problematic 	for	Germany 	at	
present 	and	has	accordingly 	not	been 	brought

not	only	appropriate 	but	also	necessary 	for	
an	early 	warning 	system 	to	treat 	the	two	
phenomena 	differently.
The	adopted 	procedure, 	however, 	will	not	be	
confined 	exclusively 	to	countries 	running 	cur-
rent	account 	deficits. 	Although 	the	early 	
warning 	system 	is	primarily 	designed 	to	be	
conducive 	towards 	promoting 	competitive -
ness, 	and	the	scoreboard 	and	benchmarks 	
are	to	be	designed 	with 	this	objective 	in	
mind, 	the	European 	Parliament 	negotiated 	
an	additional 	requirement 	that	even 	coun -
tries	running 	current 	account 	surpluses 	come 	
under 	scrutiny 	in	cases 	where 	the	sources 	of	
macroeconomic 	instability 	need 	to	be	found.
The sustainability of external asset  
positions: methodological approaches
The	sustainability 	of	a	given 	economy’s 	exter -
nal	asset 	position 	is	difficult 	to	assess 	specific -
ally.	Various 	empirical 	procedures 	can	be	em-
ployed 	to	distinguish 	sustainable 	develop -
ments 	from 	unsustainable 	developments. 	
None 	of	these 	approaches, 	however, 	is	free	
of	methodological 	deficiencies 	and	therefore 	
above 	criticism.
Anecdotal 	evidence 	attempts 	to	show 	a	rela-
tionship 	between 	the	historical 	pattern 	of	
economic 	variables 	and	the	existence 	of	cri-
ses.	Thus, 	for	example, 	with 	regard 	to	the	
current 	account, 	it	can	be	seen 	that	past	def-
icits	were 	frequently 	accompanied 	by	a	bal-
ance 	of	payments 	crisis 	if	they	exceeded 	be-
tween 	4%	and	6%	of	GDP	for	a	protracted 	
period 	of	time.14	However, 	there 	are	also	many 	cases 	in	which 	such 	developments 	did	
not	culminate 	in	crises.
Statistical 	procedures 	are	relatively 	simple 	
and	transparent 	and	are	based 	on	historical 	
data 	patterns. 	They 	generally 	assume 	that	
values 	of	a	given 	metric 	which 	are	near	their 	
average 	(over 	time	and	across 	the	economies 	
in	the	study) 	are	nothing 	to	be	alarmed 	about 	
in	principle. 	By	contrast, 	extreme 	values, 	such 	
as	particularly 	high	current 	account 	deficits 	or	
external 	debt 	levels 	which 	are	well	above 	
average, 	are	seen 	as	meriting 	closer 	atten -
tion.
Possible 	thresholds 	for	triggering 	closer 	scru-
tiny	could 	be	the	metric 	entering 	the	lower 	or	
upper 	10% 	quantile 	or	the	lowermost 	or	
uppermost 	quartile 	of	all	observations. 	On	
the	basis 	of	the	national 	current 	account 	bal-
ances 	of	the	individual 	euro-area 	member 	
states 	(changing 	composition) 	between 	1999 	
and	2010, 	these 	thresholds 	would 	come 	out	
to	-9%	(10% 	quantile) 	or	-4%	(25% 	quan -
tile)	of	GDP	for	deficit 	countries, 	depending 	
on	the	quantile 	chosen.15	In	2010, 	Greece

terpreted, 	also	Cyprus 	(-7.7%), 	Spain 	(-4.6%) 	
and	Malta 	(-4.2%) 	would 	have 	merited 	closer 	
scrutiny. 	For	current 	account 	surpluses, 	the

Econometric 	procedures 	are	based 	on	esti-
mated 	economic 	relationships 	between, 	for	
example, 	the	current 	account 	position 	and	
certain 	macroeconomic 	determinants. 	Essen -
tially, 	a	crucial 	difficulty 	lies	in	identifying 	the	
relevant 	fundamental 	factors 	and, 	on	that	
basis, 	defining 	an	acceptable 	or	desired 	pat-
tern	of	these 	variables 	in	order 	to	derive 	ro-

could 	be	the	reason 	why	only	deviations 	
above 	a	certain 	threshold 	imply 	turmoil 	while 	
smaller 	deviations 	are	virtually 	without 	conse -
quences. 	It	is	also	very	difficult 	to	weigh 	the	
individual 	indicators 	in	terms 	of	relevance. 	
The	planned 	surveillance 	procedures 	there -
fore	generally 	equate 	all	indicators 	implicitly 	
and	subject 	them 	to	an	economic 	assess -
ment. 	The	fact	that	only	economically 	signifi -
cant	deviations 	of	multiple 	indicators 	should 	
be	interpreted 	as	a	sign	of	crisis 	should 	enter 	
into	this	assessment.
There 	is	ultimately 	no	procedure 	which 	pro-
vides 	unambiguous 	and	uncontroversial 	
quantitative 	guidance 	or	benchmarks. 	All	re-
sults	are	fraught 	with	high	uncertainty. 	The	
difficulty 	in	deriving 	robust 	benchmarks 	
underscores 	the	need 	to	supplement 	the	pro-
cedures 	described 	above 	with	more 	in-depth 	
macroeconomic 	studies 	which 	look	closely 	at	
country-specific 	characteristics. 	Moreover, 	
the	considerable 	uncertainty 	means 	that	it	
makes 	sense 	not	to	use	the	empirical 	results 	
as	point 	estimates 	but	to	permit 	a	range 	of	
acceptable 	values. 	It	must 	always 	be	borne 	in	
mind 	when 	interpreting 	empirical 	results 	
that, 	although 	they	are	able	to	show 	–	based 	
on	past	experience 	–	the	initial 	signs 	of	po-
tential 	unsound 	developments, 	they	do	not	
offer 	ironclad 	certainty 	of	thereby 	preventing 	
any	sort	of	future 	crisis 	developments 	alto-
gether.Econometrically estimating  
external positions: a practical example
Irrespective 	of	the	flaws 	of	econometric 	anal-
yses	presented 	earlier, 	empirical 	estimations 	
provide 	important 	information 	about 	the	de-
terminants 	of,	for	instance, 	current 	account 	
trends 	in	the	EU.	A	better 	understanding 	of	
the	underlying 	economic 	interrelationships 	
can	thus	be	obtained.

Empirical panel study on the fundamental determinants of current account balances
Deutsche BundesbankThe main determinants of current account bal-
ances are identifi  ed below using a panel ap-
proach. Along the lines of the IMF’s macroeco-
nomic balance approach, an equilibrium rela-
tionship between the current account balance 
and a number of fundamental variables is as-
sumed.1 The underlying data set covers the 27 EU 
countries over the 1994 to 2009 period. We esti-
mate the regression equation2
,
where CA is the current account balance as a 
percentage of GDP, NFA net foreign assets as a 
percentage of GDP, OIL the oil balance in rela-
tion to GDP, GRT the annual percentage growth 
of (real) GDP, (Q)GDP  (squared) per-capita in-
come, DEP_Y  the ratio of dependent youth (< 15 
years) to the total population, DEP_O  the ratio 
of elderly dependents (> 64 years) to the total 
population, FISC the fi  scal balance and INV pri-
vate investment.3 The sub-indices i and t denote 
countries and observation year respectively and ε 
is the error term.
According to the results of the empirical study,4 
the relationship between (lagged) net foreign 
assets and the current account balance is signifi  -
cantly negative. By motivating increased domes-tic saving, a rise in external debt tends to be ac-
companied by a reduction in existing current ac-
count defi  cits or the transition to current account 
surpluses. The direct accounting effect of rising 
external debt with higher interest payments and 
dividends is apparently overcompensated. Over 
the longer term, this therefore appears to empir-
ically confi  rm a reduction in existing imbalances.
The inﬂ  uence of the oil balance shows the ex-
pected sign, but is not signifi  cant. The hypothesis

omies is likewise not supported by the empirical 
study. This result, which is also confi  rmed by other empirical studies, is referred to and discussed in the literature as the “allocation  puzzle”.
5
By contrast, the estimates support the “stage of development theory” of a non-linear relation-ship between per-capita income and the current account. In less developed economies with re-stricted access to the international capital mar-kets, capital inﬂ  ows initially expand as incomes increase. However, as the economic catching-up process progresses, the relationship – on an aver-age of the countries in the study – reverses itself, until ultimately current account surpluses can be achieved with increasing income; this serves to repay the accumulated debt.
The demographic inﬂ  uence is determined by 
looking at the dependent age group. Whilst the domestic saving ratio and the current account balance apparently fall as the share of depend-ent youth in the total population rises, an in-verse relationship arises for the dependency ratio of the elderly population.
6 This is an inter-
esting result, especially for Germany, as it implies that pensioners do not dissave in the expected manner: in fact, their growing share in the total population has likely contributed to the German current account surplus in recent years.The fi  scal balance is also a signifi  cant determin-ant of the current account. A rise in the fi  scal defi  cit by 1% of GDP is estimated to reduce the 
current account balance by 0.1 percentage point. 
This helps to create “twin defi  cits”, ie simultan-eous current account defi  cits and fi  scal defi  cits, and clearly illustrates that, in contrast to the the-ory of Ricardian equivalence, a rise in fi  scal debt cannot be offset entirely by an adjustment of private saving.
7
As expected, the inﬂ  uence of private investment 
is highly signifi  cant. A coeffi  cient of 0.8 implies that part of the (increase or decrease in) invest-ment is offset by a similar change in saving be-haviour. However, this Feldstein-Horioka puzzle is not pronounced, indicating the high degree of fi  nancial integration within the EU.
8
The explanatory value of the estimation is very high, with an R
2 of 0.96. However, this is partly 
due to fi  xed country effects, which do not pro-vide any economically interpretable explanation for the dependent variable. The fi  xed effect for Germany is thus 6.6% of GDP, above the actual value of the current account balance in 2010 (5.7%). Furthermore, the AR terms required to correct the autocorrelation indicate a persist-ence of the current account balance without specifying the reasons more precisely.

study. This result, which is also confi  rmed by other empirical studies, is referred to and discussed in the literature as the “allocation  puzzle”.

By contrast, the estimates support the “stage of development theory” of a non-linear relation-ship between per-capita income and the current account. In less developed economies with re-stricted access to the international capital mar-kets, capital inﬂ  ows initially expand as incomes increase. However, as the economic catching-up process progresses, the relationship – on an aver-age of the countries in the study – reverses itself, until ultimately current account surpluses can be achieved with increasing income; this serves to repay the accumulated debt.
The demographic inﬂ  uence is determined by 
looking at the dependent age group. Whilst the domestic saving ratio and the current account balance apparently fall as the share of depend-ent youth in the total population rises, an in-verse relationship arises for the dependency ratio of the elderly population.
6 This is an inter-
esting result, especially for Germany, as it implies that pensioners do not dissave in the expected manner: in fact, their growing share in the total population has likely contributed to the German current account surplus in recent years.The fi  scal balance is also a signifi  cant determin-ant of the current account. A rise in the fi  scal defi  cit by 1% of GDP is estimated to reduce the 
current account balance by 0.1 percentage point. 
This helps to create “twin defi  cits”, ie simultan-eous current account defi  cits and fi  scal defi  cits, and clearly illustrates that, in contrast to the the-ory of Ricardian equivalence, a rise in fi  scal debt cannot be offset entirely by an adjustment of private saving.
7
As expected, the inﬂ  uence of private investment 
is highly signifi  cant. A coeffi  cient of 0.8 implies that part of the (increase or decrease in) invest-ment is offset by a similar change in saving be-haviour. However, this Feldstein-Horioka puzzle is not pronounced, indicating the high degree of fi  nancial integration within the EU.
8
The explanatory value of the estimation is very high, with an R
2 of 0.96. However, this is partly 
due to fi  xed country effects, which do not pro-vide any economically interpretable explanation for the dependent variable. The fi  xed effect for Germany is thus 6.6% of GDP, above the actual value of the current account balance in 2010 (5.7%). Furthermore, the AR terms required to correct the autocorrelation indicate a persist-ence of the current account balance without specifying the reasons more precisely.

were 	responsible 	for	part	of	the	increase 	in	
the	current 	account 	balance 	since 	the	begin -
ning	of	monetary 	union. 	Over 	the	past	dec-
ade,	in	connection 	with	the	increasing 	ageing 	
of	society, 	the	public 	has	become 	more 	strongly 	aware 	of	the	need 	to	save	privately 	
in	order 	to	maintain 	its	standard 	of	living 	in

NiGEM simulations of the impact of economic policy measures on the current account  *)
Under the European surveillance framework, an 
in-depth country analysis is conducted in order 
to investigate individual current account levels 
that exceed or fall below certain thresholds. 
Where risks of emerging imbalances are identi-
fi  ed, concrete economic policy measures to bring 
external positions back to sustainable paths 
should be recommended.
As a general rule, governments are unable to di-
rectly inﬂ  uence all the measures that could be 
implemented. Nevertheless, to a certain extent, 
action on their part can put in place a basic 
framework which sets incentives aimed at modi-
fying behaviour in the desired manner. In this 
box, a sample of the economic policy interven-
tions presently under discussion, which are de-
rived from empirical contexts, will be simulated 
in order to identify their workings. The analysis 
will focus on the timeline and extent of the ef-
fects on the German current account. Moreover, 
the spillover effects on the external balances of 
other economies are also examined.
Specifi  cally, the effects of an increase in the re-
tirement age and in labour force participation as 
well as a reduction in corporate taxation to the 
average level prevailing in the euro area1 are ex-
amined.
The simulations, which were conducted using 
 NiGEM Version 2.11, assume rational expecta-
tions with regard to wages, interest rates, ex-
change rates, share prices and inﬂ  ation. They 
presuppose myopic consumers and a (modelled) 
two-pillar monetary strategy of the Eurosystem. In each case, the shock period is 10 years, during 
which time the variables in question are inﬂ  u-
enced exogenously. This means that any reper-
cussions which might arise from the response of 
the economic environment are disregarded. Not 
until the simulated exogenous inﬂ  uence has run 
its course do market forces unfold fully again. As 
a rule, the shocked variable does not revert to 
those values assumed by NiGEM in the baseline 
scenario; instead, there is a strong possibility 
that it will continue to differ from them long af-
ter the simulated economic policy intervention 
has come to a close.
Since wage negotiations and the fi  nancial mar-
kets are assumed to be subject to rational expec-
tations, some responses which do not occur until 
the actual shock period is over can also affect the 
impact of policy measures. For this reason, the 
simulation results are calculated over an 18-year 
timeframe, which is much longer than the actual 
period under review.
The simulations largely confi  rm the results de-
rived from the empirical panel analysis, which 
are presented on pages 50 and 51. For instance, 
economic policy measures that are connected 
with demographic developments or which repre-
sent a political response to demographic changes 
appear to have a long-term impact on the Ger-
man current account balance. Reforms which ex-
tend average working lives through an increase 
in the retirement age or which lead to higher la-
bour force participation will tend to reduce the 
German current account surplus owing to rising 
demand for investment and consumption.

tion program developed by the National Institute of Economic and 
Social Research (NIESR). — 1 The values given in the NiGEM database are used. Data on corporate taxation are based on the calculations in

Moreover, it is also evident that measures aimed 
at stoking private investment directly are to some extent taking hold. Lowering profi  t-dependent corporate taxes to the average level for the euro area would cause the current ac-count balance to contract on account of rising investment demand.
The smoothest results over time can apparently 
be obtained by a combination of the presented measures, as this evens out the individual time lags with which they take effect. It follows that, in principle, the best tool for eliminating inter-nal and external imbalances would be a coher-ent and consistent economic policy that can be applied in multiple areas.
The spillover to other euro-area countries that 
would result from the economic policy measures under examination is extremely moderate. Since such transmission generally spreads to numerous economies, Germany is constrained in its ability to eliminate imbalances at both the euro-area and global level. The results thus particularly em-phasise the individual responsibility of the defi  -cit countries for eradicating their external imbal-ances.
A variety of alternative scenarios based on 
changes to assumptions shall serve as a sensitiv-ity analysis of the above simulation results. For example, if the baseline scenario’s assumption of rational expectations is replaced with the as-sumption of consumer myopia, most variables generally end up reacting to the simulated pol-icy measures with a certain time lag. The basic impacts, however, are broadly comparable, and the magnitude of these effects is affected only minimally by the adjusted NiGEM simulations.
Ultimately, it is important to note that the re-
sults yielded by the projections for Germany can-not be automatically applied to other countries. All of the OECD countries (excepting Turkey, Ice-land, Luxembourg and Chile) are modelled sepa-rately using between 60 and 130 single equa-tions and the parameters for each country are estimated individually. Moreover, differences in baseline situations, eg with respect to public debt, employment fi  gures or interest rates, can affect the impact of policy measures.
As with the empirical estimates, the NiGEM sim-
ulation results are complicated by the challenge of forging economic policy recommendations to correct current account balances. In this context, there is evidence of considerable lags or of ef-fects on internal and external variables reversing themselves over time.
This makes it diffi  cult to determine in what cycli-
cal environment the effects occur and the extent to which measures can be described as effi  cient. To all intents and purposes, the current account constitutes a residual rather than a policy varia-ble that can be inﬂ  uenced by government ac-tion. Furthermore, the fact that the actual ef-fects are limited gives cause to question whether economic policy measures can, in fact, inﬂ  uence the path of the current account.

The	primary 	purpose 	is	to	assess 	whether 	the	
simulated 	policy 	interventions 	would 	be	fun-
damentally 	capable 	of	contributing 	to	a	per-
ceptible 	reduction 	in	the	existing 	surplus. 	
Moreover, 	potential 	spillovers 	need 	to	be	
taken 	into	account 	–	in	other 	words, 	we	need 	
to	examine 	how	changes 	to	the	German 	cur-

tries’ 	external 	balances, 	or	whether 	measures 	
in	Germany 	indirectly 	promote 	the	reduction 	
of	imbalances 	elsewhere.
On	the	whole, 	measures 	relating 	to	demo -
graphic 	developments 	do	show 	up	in	the	cur-
rent	account; 	however, 	the	impact 	is	mostly 	
moderate. 	For	instance, 	if	it	were 	possible 	to	
increase 	employment 	among 	the	elderly 	by	
1 %	by	raising 	the	retirement 	age,	private 	
consumption 	would 	rise	only	temporarily, 	
and	only	marginally, 	by	not	more 	than 	0.05%. 	
The	demand 	for	private 	investment, 	after 	an	
initial 	decline, 	would 	rise	by	the	same 	extent 	
in	the	medium 	term. 	On	the	whole, 	the	per-
manent 	reduction 	in	the	current 	account 	bal-
ance, 	at	around 	0.05% 	of	GDP , 	would 	be

would 	also	only	be	temporary, 	since 	the	in-
crease	 in	the	labour	 supply	 would	 put	signifi -
cant	 pressure	 on	nominal	 wages.	 In	terms	 of	
the	external	 effect,	 a	reduction	 in	the	current	
account 	surplus 	by	around 	0.3% 	of	GDP	
would	 be	expected	 after	 three	 years.
The	relative 	weakness 	of	private 	investment	
activity	 in	Germany	 in	the	past	 few	 years	 has	
frequently	 been	 seen	 by	international	 organ -
isations	 as	a	key	indicator	 of	German	 current	
account 	growth.25	We	study 	the	effect 	of	a	
reduction 	in	profit-related 	taxes 	in	line	with	
economic	 policy	 conclusions:	 for	example,	 by	
reducing 	the	tax	rate	on	corporate 	profits	
from 	its	current 	level	of	around 	26% 	to	the	
euro-area 	average 	rate	of	21.8%. 	Using 	the	
simulations 	conducted 	would 	lead	to	a	con-
siderable	 increase	 in	private	 investment	 by	up	
to	5%;	 the	attendant	 reduction	 in	the	current	
account	 balance	 would	 remain	 relatively	 con-
stant 	at	around 	0.6% 	of	GDP 	during 	the	
simulation	 period.
According	 to	the	simulations,	 the	smoothest	
effects	 over	 time	 can	be	achieved	 by	a	com-
bination 	of	the	measures 	presented 	earlier,	
since 	the	differences 	over	time	in	the	work -
ings	 of	the	individual	 mechanisms	 partly	 can-
cel	each	 other	 out.	 They	 would	 lead	 to	a	sus-
tained 	reduction 	in	Germany’s 	current 	ac-count	 balance	 of	close	 to	1 %	of	GDP .	 Private	
investment 	demand, 	in	particular, 	would	
benefit	 from	 such	 a	package	 of	measures.	 On	
the	whole, 	however, 	the	quantifiable 	effects	
for	Germany,	 based	 on	the	simulations,	 may	
be	described	 as	moderate.
What	 the	simulations	 also	 clearly	 show	 is	that	
these	 already	 moderate	 effects	 of	the	afore -
mentioned 	economic 	policy 	measures 	on	
Germany’s 	current 	account 	would 	make	
themselves	 felt	only	 marginally	 in	other	 Euro -
pean	 economies’	 external	 balances.	 The	spill-
overs	 caused	 by	the	induced	 economic	 policy	
measures, 	in	terms 	of	their 	volumes 	– apart	
from	 some	 temporary	 volatility	 –	are	virtually	
negligible. 	This	confirms 	recent 	studies 	by	
IMF	staff	 and,	 in	the	light	 of	the	high	 regional	
and	 also	 sectoral	 diversification	 of	Germany’s	
external 	relationships, 	is	not	particularly 	sur-
prising.26
Finally,	 we	must	 point	 out	that	 the	measures	
studied	 should	 not	be	interpreted	 as	specific	
economic	 policy	 reform	 proposals	 since	 some	
of	these 	areas 	cannot 	be	directly 	influenced	
by	economic	 policy.	 Generally,	 politicians	 can	
favour 	these 	measures 	in	the	long	run,	if	at	
all,	by	making 	adjustments 	in	the	incentive	
system.	 It	must	 be	noted,	 moreover,	 that	 the	
presented 	corrections 	cannot 	be	imple -
mented 	in	isolation. 	For	instance, 	economic	… or reforms 
in corporate taxation …

policy 	decision-makers 	cannot 	lose	sight 	of	
the	impact 	that	a	fiscally 	relevant 	measure 	
would 	have 	on	the	general 	government 	
budget.
The	current 	account 	is	ultimately 	an	indicator 	
variable 	and	not	a	policy 	variable 	that	can	be	
manipulated 	at	will	by	government 	actions. 	
Rather, 	it	is	very	much 	the	result 	of	individual 	
decisions 	taken 	by	agents 	both 	in	Germany 	
and	abroad. 	Thus, 	the	calculated 	deviations 	
from 	the	benchmarks 	only	provide 	indica -
tions 	of	potential 	unsound 	structural 	devel -
opments. 	Economic 	policy 	measures 	must 	be	
oriented 	to	“underlying” 	variables 	and	not	to	
the	current 	account 	itself, 	which 	is	ultimately 	
a	residual. 	However, 	the	high	uncertainty 	sur-
rounding 	the	drivers 	of	current 	account 	de-
velopments 	shows 	that	macroeconomic 	fine-
tuning 	is	not	appropriate 	and	should 	conse -
quently 	be	avoided.
Conclusion
Efforts 	towards 	increased 	economic 	policy 	
surveillance 	within 	the	EU	and	in	the	G20	
context 	require 	an	intensive 	analysis 	of	sus-
tainable 	external 	positions. 	Benchmarks 	for	
current 	account 	balances 	are	likely 	to	play	an	
important 	role	in	both 	processes 	in	future. 	An	
early 	warning 	system 	is	being 	planned 	in	
order 	to	examine 	economies 	using 	a	small 	set	
of	macroeconomic 	variables 	to	flag	potential 	
internal 	imbalances, 	but	also, 	and	in	particu -
lar,	external 	divergences.
Although 	statistical 	and	econometric 	proce -
dures 	contribute 	to	the	identification 	of	initial 	signs 	of	imbalances 	in	the	context 	of	an	early 	
warning 	mechanism, 	they	need 	to	be	inter-
preted 	in	economic 	terms. 	Signs 	of	any	po-
tential 	need 	for	adjustment 	are	then 	to	be	
examined 	in	more 	detail 	in	an	in-depth 	coun -
try	analysis. 	Above 	and	beyond 	a	stocktake 	
of	potential 	imbalances, 	a	further 	goal	of	
international 	efforts 	is,	if	significant 	risks	
exist, 	to	issue 	economic 	policy 	recommenda -
tions 	to	the	affected 	economies 	and	to	make 	
efforts 	to	ensure 	compliance 	with	these 	rec-
ommendations.
This	aim	is	fundamentally 	welcome 	in	the	
light	of	the	severe 	global 	turmoil 	that	macro -
economic 	imbalances 	can	trigger. 	That	said, 	
however, 	the	above 	expositions 	suggest 	that	
the	concept 	of	economic 	policy 	surveillance 	
should 	be	used 	cautiously, 	as	the	sustainabil -
ity	of	external 	positions 	cannot 	unreservedly 	
be	captured 	by	empirically 	determined 	bench -
mark 	values. 	Studies 	based 	on	past	experi -
ence 	ultimately 	provide 	no	guarantee 	of	be-
ing	able	to	warn 	reliably 	of	future 	threats. 	
Moreover, 	there 	are	also	potential 	problems 	
associated 	with 	the	reduction 	of	identified 	
imbalances. 	One	example 	for	Germany 	shows 	
why	this	is	the	case. 	Although 	suitable 	eco-
nomic 	policy 	reforms 	are,	in	principle, 	capa -
ble	of	affecting 	decisions 	on	saving 	or	invest -
ing,	their 	effect 	on	the	current 	account 	is	
only	moderate, 	and	detailed 	impacts 	are	dif-
ficult 	to	forecast. 	This	is	also	true	of	the	
	spillovers 	of	these 	measures 	to	other 	Euro -
pean 	countries.
Ultimately, 	the	current 	account 	balance 	is	not	
an	independent 	policy 	target 	but	instead 	the	
result 	of	numerous, 	largely 	private-sector 	de-The current

cisions 	at	home 	and	abroad. 	It	is	therefore	
beyond	 the	direct	 control	 of	economic	 policy -
makers. 	Against 	this	background, 	economic	
intervention 	should 	be	permitted 	to	occur	
only	 in	the	event	 of	severe	 unsound	 develop -
ments	 which	 could	 also	 spill	over	 significantly	
to	other	 economies;	 excessive	 debt	 is	one	pri-mary	 example	 of	such	 a	development.	 How -
ever, 	macroeconomic 	fine-tuning 	should 	be	
avoided 	because 	of	the	high	diagnostic 	un-
certainty,	 limitations	 to	the	ability	 to	manipu -
