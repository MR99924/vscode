Commentaries
Economic conditions
Economic output probably 
rose again in first quarter
The German economy beat last month’s ex -
pectations in the first quarter of 2023, probably 
increasing its activity again somewhat.1 While 
persistently high inflation weighed on private 
consumption and consumer- related service 
providers, industry saw a stronger recovery 
than expected. The return to lower energy 
prices provided direct support for energy-  
intensive production, bottlenecks in the supply 
of intermediate goods continued to ease and 
demand picked up again markedly. Output also 
rose sharply in the main construction sector, al -
though higher construction prices and finan -
cing costs continued to dampen demand for 
construction work considerably. Unlike in in -
dustry, it was mainly temporary factors that are 
likely to have contributed to this increase, espe -
cially the mild weather in January and February 
by normal standards, following December wea -
ther that had been unfavourable for construc -
tion activity.
Inflation weighing on 
 consumption
Private consumption and consumer- related ser -
vice providers suffered in the first quarter from 
high inflation and the resulting reluctance to 
buy. This was especially evident in the retail 
sector, where seasonally and price- adjusted 
sales fell perceptibly on average in January and 
February compared with the previous quarter.2 
Revenues were down somewhat in the hotel 
and restaurant sector as well. Moreover, there 
is still a great deal of catching up to do to get 
back to pre- pandemic levels. Consumers also 
purchased considerably fewer cars in the first 
quarter than in the previous quarter. The num -
ber of new private car registrations went down steeply according to the German Association of 
the Automotive Industry (VDA). However, this 
was also due to a one-  off effect. Anticipatory 
effects were at play in car purchases at the end 
of 2022, as government subsidies were 
scrapped for plug- in hybrids and lowered for 
electric vehicles. These anticipatory purchases 
were then absent from the statistics at the be -
ginning of 2023. The resulting rise and fall of 
domestic car purchases had very little impact 
on vehicle production, although motor vehicle 
sales in January were well below the high level 
of the fourth quarter of 2022 after price adjust -
ment. Service providers not involved in trade 
likewise remained lacklustre. According to the 
ifo Institute, their overall business situation in 
the first quarter was no better than in the pre -
vious quarter.
Industry surprisingly buoyant
Industry rebounded recently, with output up 
significantly in both January and February 2023 
after seasonal adjustment. Averaged over both 
months, a sharp rise on the previous quarter 
was recorded. Producers of consumer goods 
were affected by the weak consumption dy -
namics but the energy- intensive economic sec -
tors expanded their output markedly.3 The pro -
duction of capital goods was also up sharply, 
with more motor vehicles being manufactured 
in particular. In addition to lower energy prices, German econ -
omy performed 
better than 
expected in Q1

its activity again

1 The Federal Statistical Office’s initial flash estimate for 
real gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of 
2023 is scheduled for publication on 28 April 2023. Owing 
to the existing strains and the subdued start to the first 
quarter, a slight decline in economic output was expected 
just a month ago; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2023).
2 Seasonal adjustment here and in the remainder of this 
text also includes adjustment for calendar variations, pro -
vided they can be verified and quantified.
3 Aggregate energy- intensive sectors include the manufac -
ture of chemicals and chemical products, the manufacture 
of basic metals, the manufacture of coke and refined pet -
roleum products, the manufacture of other non-  metallic 
mineral products and the manufacture of paper and paper -
board.Deutsche Bundesbank

industrial output benefited from a continuing 
high order backlog. According to surveys con -
ducted by the ifo Institute and S&P Global, sup -
ply bottlenecks eased further, with more orders 
likely to have been processed as a result. Fresh 
demand stimulus was reflected in the recent 
steep rise in industrial new orders. The increase 
in January was still heavily concentrated on 
orders of other transport equipment and of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts from 
abroad, after which the recovery in February 
became more broad-based both in regional 
terms and across sectors. This may be an indi -
cation that demand for industrial goods has 
emerged from its cyclical low, which is also 
consistent with the renewed substantial rise in 
German exports. On an average of January and 
February, price- adjusted exports of goods were 
significantly higher than in the previous quar -
ter.
Labour market developments 
still slightly positive
The improved economic developments in the 
first quarter were also reflected in the con -
tinued slightly positive developments on the la -
bour market, with the number of persons in 
employment up marginally in February by 
around 31,000 on the month after seasonal 
adjustment. According to the disaggregated 
data available only for January, the favourable 
employment trend was driven mainly by em -
ployment subject to social security contribu -
tions, but also by exclusively low- paid part- time 
employment. Employment rose, in particular, in 
business-  related services excluding temporary 
employment and in the hotel and restaurant 
sector. By contrast, the number of persons em -
ployed in the wholesale and retail trade, which 
is heavily impacted by high inflation, went 
down slightly. Hardly any change was noted for 
employment in the manufacturing sector. Initial 
estimates show a slight decline in short- time 
work for economic reasons in January, with the 
lion’s share of these arrangements in manufac -
turing at the end of 2022 – disaggregated data Employment up 
slightly in Febru -

are not yet available for January. However, in 
line with the rebound in industrial activity, this 
sector is likewise currently reporting a marked 
fall in the number of registrations for short-  
time work compared with last autumn. The 
leading indicators of employment growth re -
mained largely stable in mildly expansionary 
territory in March. This quite positive develop -
ment in employment could therefore continue 
in the coming months.
Despite the slight increase in employment, 
registered unemployment rose by 16,000 to 
2.54 million persons in March after seasonal 
adjustment. The unemployment rate climbed 
to 5.6%. This growth related to the cyclical 
statutory unemployment insurance scheme 
and the basic welfare allowance scheme in 
equal measure. The number of persons regis -
tered as unemployed went up by 232,000 on 
the year. This is largely on account of Ukrainian 
nationals (+180,000), who were not yet in -
cluded in the German social security system a 
year ago. According to the unemployment bar -
ometer of the Institute for Employment Re -
search (IAB), local employment agencies expect 
the development of registered unemployment 
to be predominantly positive over the next 
three months. Unemployment could therefore 
fall slightly in the coming months.
Inflation rate down 
 significantly in March
Energy prices did not continue their downward 
slide in the international commodity markets 
recently. Prices had come under further pres -
sure in March given emerging demand con -
cerns in the wake of turbulence in the banking 
sector. Since then, the price of crude oil (Brent), 
in particular, has picked up again markedly, re -
cently trading at US$84 per barrel. One key 
factor behind the latest price increase was the 
surprising decision by OPEC and its partners to 
significantly reduce output for the remainder of 
the year from May onward. The price of crude 
oil is currently still around one- fifth lower than one year previously, however. Forward quota -
tions also suggest slight price reductions for 
the future. The declining trend in European gas 
and electricity prices over the past few months 
halted of late. European gas (TTF) recently cost 
€42/ MWh, which is roughly half the price re -
corded one year previously.
Prices at the upstream stages of the economy 
tended to decline recently. Prices for both im -
ports and domestic products fell on the month, 
which was mainly due to easing in global en -
ergy markets.4 The year- on- year figures also in -
dicate lower price pressures. Inflation in import 
prices, for example, decreased steeply to 2.8% 
in February, the last month for which data are 
available. For domestic products, the year- on- 
year rate halved to 7.5% in March. Excluding 
the price- dampening effect of the energy com -
ponent, prices at the upstream stages remained 
constant recently in seasonally adjusted terms.
Consumer price dynamics remained strong in 
March. The Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) was up by 0.6% on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms, the same as in Feb -
ruary, driven mainly by unprocessed food. All 
other goods and services continued to become 
markedly more expensive as well. Only the rise 
in energy prices stalled. In annual terms, how -
ever, the inflation rate fell significantly overall 
to 7.8%,5 which was 1.5  percentage points 
lower than in the previous month. The marked 
decline is due to a base effect. Energy prices 
had surged in March of last year in the wake of 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since March 
2023, the resulting higher price level compared 
with the same month of the previous year has 
been the basis for calculating the inflation rate. 
This is why the inflation rate fell, even though 
inflationary pressures remained strong at the 
current end. By contrast, the core inflation rate, 
which excludes volatile energy and food prices, Unemployment

4 The electricity and gas price brakes also play a role in the 
decline in energy prices at the industrial producer level. 
These apply not only to households but also to industry.
5 The consumer price index (CPI), calculated for national 
purposes, dropped to 7.4%.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2023

rose markedly by 0.5 percentage point to 5.9%. 
It thus reached a new all- time high.
In the coming months, the rate of inflation in 
Germany is likely to continue on a slight down -
ward trajectory. This is mainly due to the likely 
decline in consumer energy prices compared 
with the previous year. The current exception -
ally high inflation rate for food and other goods 
as well as for services should also ease slowly. 
However, a turnaround in the dynamics has yet 
to be seen. Overall, underlying price pressures 
are likely to remain high over the next few 
months.
Public finances
Local government finances
Local governments (core budgets and off-  
budget entities) closed 2022 with a surplus. At 
€2½ billion, it was €2 billion lower than it had 
been a year earlier. Revenue rose steeply, by 
6½% (+€20 billion). Tax revenue went up by 
7% (+€8 billion), while local business tax grew 
by as much as 14% (+€7 billion, after deduct -
ing shares accruing to other government 
levels). Local government revenue from fees in -
creased very sharply (10%), and transfers from 
state government rose by 7% (+€8 billion).
At 7½% (+€22 billion), however, the rise in 
local government expenditure was even 
stronger than that in revenue. Personnel ex -
penditure –  a major expenditure item  – in -
creased by 8%, with a statistical change in 
Baden-  Württemberg accounting for around 
one- quarter of this growth. Spending on social 
benefits rose by 5%. Within this category, ac -
commodation costs for those receiving un -
employment benefit II climbed moderately 
(+1%). Refugees from Ukraine have been able 
to claim these benefits since June 2022, but the 
favourable labour market situation is likely to 
have dampened government expenditure on 
this item overall. Furthermore, heating costs 
tend to increase with a lag, meaning that only part of the impact of the high energy prices is 
likely to have been felt thus far. Benefits for 
asylum seekers probably included benefits for 
Ukrainian refugees for only a few months. 
From the middle of the year onwards, refugees 
from Ukraine were eligible to claim unemploy -
ment benefit II. Nevertheless, spending on bene -
fits for asylum seekers increased very sharply 
(by 61%, or +€1½ billion). Other operating ex -
penditure rose by 8%. Fixed asset formation 
grew by 7%, driven by construction invest -
ment. Additional outlays for investment and for 
other operating expenditure are likely to re -
flect, not least, the very large increase in prices.
Local government debt increased by €7 billion 
last year.6 At the end of 2022, it amounted to 
€144 billion (including liabilities to the public 
sector). Investment- related credit market debt 
rose sharply, up by €8½ billion to €112 billion. 
Cash advances decreased by a further €1½ bil -
lion to €30 billion. Three- quarters of this reduc -
tion was attributable to local governments 
in  North Rhine-  Westphalia, Saarland and 
Rhineland- Palatinate. Nevertheless, per capita 
cash advances remained very high in these 
states compared with the average level in the 
other non-  city states (€90): local governments 
in North Rhine-  Westphalia and Rhineland-  
Palatinate even recorded values of over €1,000 
per capita across their respective states. Des -
pite a partial debt relief programme imple -
mented by the state government, local govern -
ments in Saarland had cash advances amount -
ing to €930 per capita.
Rhineland- Palatinate, too, has now launched a 
partial debt relief programme for local govern -
ments with high volumes of cash advances. 
Following last year’s constitutional amend -
ment, the implementing act to assume debt of 
€3 billion (€720 per capita across the state) 
entered into force in February 2023. Local gov -Underlying price

6 Based on the figures, the fiscal surplus would have made 
repayments an option. Local governments thus closed last 
year with larger cash reserves on balance. Local govern -
ments can use these reserves to finance their budgets, thus 
helping them avoid taking out further cash advances.Deutsche Bundesbank

ernments have until the end of September to 
apply for partial debt relief. In return, they are 
expected to repay any outstanding cash ad -
vances by the end of 2053. Otherwise, the 
state will be entitled to withdraw debt relief 
payments. The onus will thus remain on the re -
spective local governments to pursue prudent 
fiscal policy.
This year, burdens on local government budgets 
will intensify. For example, prices in the areas of 
other operating expenditure and construction 
investment are likely to rise further. In addition, 
the upcoming public sector pay agreement will 
have an impact. Tax revenue, meanwhile, is 
likely to grow at a much slower pace.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €153.7 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2023 was up on the 
previous month’s figure (€131.4 billion). After 
deducting redemptions and taking account of 
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own debt 
securities, the outstanding volume of domestic 
bonds rose by €11.5 billion. Foreign debt secur -
ities worth €11.7 billion net were placed in the 
German market. The outstanding volume of 
debt securities in Germany therefore rose by 
€23.3 billion on balance.
In the month under review, the public sector 
increased its bond market liabilities by €7.9 bil -
lion net, compared with €3.3 billion in January. 
Central government predominantly issued two- 
year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze; €6.6 bil -
lion) and five- year Federal notes (Bobls; €5.5 
billion). This contrasted with net redemptions 
of Treasury discount paper (Bubills; €10.4 bil -
lion) and ten- year Federal securities (Bunds; 
€4.9 billion). State and local governments is -
sued securities with a net value of €6.4 billion.
In February, credit institutions issued debt 
securities worth €5.3 billion net, compared with €19.2 billion one month earlier. On bal -
ance, this principally involved other bank secur -
ities (€7.9 billion) but also, to a lesser extent, 
public Pfandbriefe (€1.5 billion). By contrast, 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions and mortgage Pfandbriefe were re -
deemed in net terms to the tune of €2.9 billion 
and €1.2 billion, respectively.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €1.7 billion in February, following 
net issuance of €4.3 billion in January. On bal -
ance, redemptions were almost exclusively at -
tributable to other financial intermediaries and 
insurance companies (-€0.8 billion each).
Domestic non- banks were the strongest group 
of buyers in February. They purchased bonds 
totalling €16.4 billion net, most of which were 
foreign securities. Domestic credit institutions 
added bonds worth €13.5 billion net to their 
holdings, with the vast majority of these being 
domestic assets. Holdings of bonds in the Bun -Further burdens

desbank’s portfolio decreased by €5.0 billion 
net. Foreign investors offloaded German debt 
securities amounting to €1.7 billion net.
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares worth 
€2.4 billion were issued in the German equity 
market. The outstanding volume of foreign 
shares in the German market increased by €2.5 
billion. On balance, equities were purchased in 
February mainly by domestic credit institutions 
(€4.5 billion) and domestic non- banks (€1.6 bil -
lion). Non- resident investors trimmed their 
share portfolios by €1.2 billion.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€10.5 billion in February (€8.0 billion in Janu -
ary). On balance, specialised funds reserved for institutional investors were the primary benefi -
ciaries (€8.4 billion). Among the various asset 
classes, funds of funds and mixed securities-  
based funds attracted the largest inflows (€3.9 
billion and €3.8 billion, respectively), followed 
by bond funds (€1.9 billion) and equity funds 
(€0.8 billion). Foreign mutual funds active in 
the German market recorded inflows in the 
amount of €3.3 billion. Domestic non- banks 
proved to be the main buyers (€13.3 billion). In 
net terms, foreign investors acquired German 
mutual fund shares for €1.0 billion, while do -
mestic credit institutions sold €0.4 billion worth 
of mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €22.6 billion in February 2023, up €5.6 
billion on the previous month’s level. While the 
surplus in invisible current transactions, which 
comprise services as well as primary and sec -
ondary income, decreased, the surplus in the 
goods account expanded to a greater extent.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account increased by €7.3 billion to 
€19.0 billion because receipts rose and expend -
iture fell.
The surplus in invisible current transactions de -
clined by €1.7 billion to €3.6 billion, largely be -
cause the deficit in the services account ex -
panded by €1.1 billion to €2.6 billion. Expend -
iture decreased overall, driven primarily by 
lower expenditure on other business- related 
services. However, receipts declined more 
sharply, as, in addition to reduced receipts from 
these services, receipts from transport services, 
fees for the use of intellectual property and 
financial and manufacturing services also fell 
markedly. Moreover, the deficit in the second -
ary income account expanded by €0.5 billion 
to €6.0 billion. Higher non- government and 
government expenditure contributed to this in -
crease. This was due, in particular, to increased 
general government payments to the EU Net issuance of

Money market conditions and remuneration 
of government deposits
Traditionally, the public sector has held only small deposits on accounts with the Bundesbank, 
deterred mainly by the interest arrangements. The Bundesbank’s zero interest rate policy for 
account balances meant that the public sector was usually better off holding liquid funds on 
interest- bearing accounts with commercial banks or investing them in other ways in the money 
market.
In June 2014, the interest rate on banks’ account balances was lowered into negative territory. In 
line with Eurosystem regulations, remuneration of government deposits held with the Bundesbank 
was also generally negative – charged at the interest rate on the Eurosystem’s deposit facility 
(deposit rate). However, interest rate conditions for these deposits only deteriorated in absolute 
terms, i.e. in terms of their level. Compared with market conditions, it became increasingly attract -
ive for the public sector to hold liquid funds with the Bundesbank.
In the years thereafter, large- scale monetary policy asset purchases by the Eurosystem led to an 
unprecedented rise in excess liquidity held by banks. At the same time, general government 
deposits at the Bundesbank likewise went up sharply. As a result of the monetary and fiscal pol -
icy measures taken in response to the coronavirus pandemic, account balances increased again 
as the pandemic progressed – to more than twice their previous levels.
The deposit rate was raised back into positive territory in September 2022, thus prompting the 
question as to what this would mean for interest arrangements for public sector deposits going 
forward. Maintaining the previously applicable zero interest rate on these balances would have 
likely led to extensive liquidity flows into the money market in the short term. This could poten -
tially have contributed to lower interest rates amid increased volatility in various money market 
segments. Against this background, the Eurosystem – taking market conditions into account – 
permitted national central banks to pay a positive interest rate on government deposits – initially 
for a limited period until April 2023. As of May 2023, the maximum permissible interest rate on 
account balances will then be reduced by 20 basis points (measured in terms of market condi -
tions) until further notice.
The account balances that general government holds with the Bundesbank have now fallen sig -
nificantly. To a certain extent, account holders again have attractive options to invest in the mar -
ket. The public sector is therefore likely to continue shifting liquid funds from the Bundesbank to 
commercial banks in the second quarter as interest rate incentives improve. Reducing the Euro -
system balance sheet helps to limit the risk of this foreseeable and desirable development having 
an adverse impact on money market conditions.
The Bundesbank advocates reinstating the zero interest rate policy for government deposits fur -
ther down the line. This policy gives due account to the fact that such deposits do not fulfil an 
autonomous monetary policy function. Account management for public sector players is just one 
of a range of services offered by the Bundesbank for private and public banks in addition to its 
mandate to support and safeguard the fulfilment of public sector activities.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Short- term account balances play an important 
role in the cash management of public admin -
istrations. They enable public authorities to off -
set fluctuations in revenue and expenditure 
and, if necessary, to make significant payments 
at short notice. In recent years, the public sec -
tor in Germany has increasingly shifted liquid 
funds from interest- bearing accounts at com -
mercial banks or from other money market in -
vestments to accounts held at the Bundes -
bank.1
As part of its statutory mandate, the Bundes -
bank is the government’s fiscal agent and 
offers various services to the public sector, in -
cluding, in particular, account management 
and the settlement of payment transactions.2 
This means that not only commercial banks3 
but also public administrations, as well as both 
private- law and public- law entities4 that per -
form duties of public administrations or process 
payments for public administrations, can hold 
an account at the Bundesbank. At the end of 
the day, public sector accounts with the central 
bank must always be at least balanced.5
In addition to monetary policy considerations 
and market economy principles, the prohibition 
on monetary financing (Article 123 TFEU) pre -
vents central banks from remunerating govern -
ment deposits at a higher rate than the com -
parable market conditions.6 Comparable mar -
ket interest rates are therefore an important 
point of reference for the maximum interest 
rate on public sector account balances with 
Eurosystem central banks. For the public sector, 
the possibility of holding balances on the cen -
tral bank account is, in principle, only a supple -
ment to services offered by commercial banks 
and other investments in the money market. 
General government deposits with the central 
bank have no monetary policy function: as a 
rule, the interest arrangements for public sec -
tor accounts are not part of money market 
management under the Eurosystem’s monetary 
policy. From a monetary policy perspective, short- term interest rates can be managed with -
out having to pay a positive interest rate on 
government deposits.
At the same time, the national central banks’ 
duties as fiscal agents should not impede the 
Eurosystem’s performance of monetary policy 
tasks or the achievement of its price stability 
objective. Against this background, it has trad -
itionally sought to counter excessive growth 
and unnecessary fluctuations in general gov -
ernment deposits.7 This facilitates the Eurosys -
tem’s liquidity management and, with it, imple -
mentation of the single monetary policy. In 
light of this, the Eurosystem has tended to re -
frain from positively remunerating such bal -
ances with a view to setting incentives for de -
posits to be placed in the market. Thus, until 
negative key interest rates were introduced, 
public sector deposits with Eurosystem central 
banks reflected, in particular, the need for cen -
tral bank account balances in public cash man -
agement including payment transactions.

entirely default- free. Deposits with commercial banks may 
be subject to risk in individual cases, especially as public 
sector deposits are not covered by the deposit guarantee 
scheme.

ations by the national central banks8 has regu -
lated the remuneration of government de -
posits. The ECB Governing Council initially set 
the market rate (for unsecured overnight de -
posits) as the absolute ceiling for the remuner -
ation of (overnight) government deposits with 
Eurosystem central banks. As a general rule, 
each national central bank may apply the mar -
ket rate only to relatively small account bal -
ances of up to 0.04% of the gross domestic 
product of the Member State in which that na -
tional central bank is domiciled (or up to €200 
million, if this is higher). Beyond this threshold, 
a zero interest rate is generally applied if the 
deposit facility rate (deposit rate) is zero or 
higher. When the deposit rate was lowered into 
negative territory in June 2014, the ECB Gov -
erning Council specified that the deposit rate 
would likewise serve as the ceiling for remuner -
ating government deposits (beyond the thresh -
old) in the event of a negative deposit rate.9
When the deposit rate was raised back into 
positive territory in September 2022, the ECB 
Governing Council initially allowed the positive 
remuneration of all public sector account bal -
ances with Eurosystem central banks, albeit 
only provisionally. In order to preserve the ef -
fectiveness of monetary policy transmission 
and safeguard orderly market functioning, it 
decided on 8 September 2022 to temporarily 
remove the 0% interest rate ceiling for remu -
nerating government deposits. Instead, for the 
period up to 30 April 2023, the ceiling for the 
remuneration of government deposits re -
mained at either the Eurosystem’s deposit facil -
ity rate or the euro short-  term rate (€STR), 
whichever was lower.10
The temporary removal of the interest rate ceil -
ing in September 2022 was linked to concerns 
that an immediate transition to zero interest 
rates would lead to an abrupt outflow of de -
posits into the market. Such deposit outflows 
threatened to exacerbate the collateral scarcity 
that was emerging in some segments of the 
euro area repo market11 and thus run counter 
to monetary policy.12The ECB combined the transitional arrange -
ment, initially limited until 30 April 2023, with 
a call urging public sector depositors to look 
for alternatives to central bank deposits, em -
phasising that the temporary change to remu -
neration does not alter the long- term desirabil -
ity of encouraging market intermediation.13
In February 2023, the ECB Governing Council 
decided to readjust the ceiling for remunerat -
ing certain deposits as of 1 May 2023.14 The 
new ceiling for the remuneration of govern -
ment deposits is to be set at the €STR minus 20 
basis points, taking effect on 1 May 2023. Ac -
cording to the ECB, this change reflects the fact 
that, while conditions in the repo market have 
improved since September 2022, the market 
remains fragile. It believes that it is still import -
ant for these deposits to return to the market 
in a gradual manner and sees the changes to 
the remuneration regime as providing incen -
tives for depositors to gradually run down their 
holdings with the Eurosystem. The ECB Gov -
erning Council announced that it stands ready 
to make further adjustments to the remuner -
ation regime if necessary.15
As a result, monetary policy and non- monetary 
policy counterparties with a central bank ac -
count have been, and still are, subject to diver -
gent (interest) conditions which set different in -
centives for their respective money market ac -
tivity and have also shaped the development of ECB Guideline

public sector account balances at the central 
bank in recent years.
Development of general 
 government deposits: 
the Bundesbank and the 
 Eurosystem as a whole
In the early years of monetary union, general 
government held hardly any noteworthy bal -
ances on accounts with the Bundesbank. A 
temporary departure from this trend was the 
rise in balances in the wake of the 2008 finan -
cial crisis.16 From the second half of 2015 on -
wards, there was a more lasting increase in 
general government balances on Bundesbank 
accounts (see the chart above).
The main driver of this development was the 
increasingly attractive interest rate on balances 
with the central bank compared with alterna -
tive investments in the money market. In paral -
lel with the ECB Governing Council’s key inter -
est rate decision of June 2014, deposits with 
the central bank were remunerated at the de -
posit facility rate, which entered negative terri -
tory at that point in time. From 2015 on, alter -
native investments in the secured money mar -
ket were increasingly only possible at rates 
below the deposit facility rate (see the chart on p. 17) given the sharp trend growth of excess 
liquidity in the banking system caused, amongst 
other factors, by the Eurosystem’s monetary 
policy asset purchases. The deterioration of 
interest rate conditions in absolute terms in the 
negative interest rate environment was accom -
panied by a relative improvement due to 
changes in interest arrangements: compared 
with prevailing market conditions, it became 
increasingly attractive for general government 
to hold liquid funds on Bundesbank accounts.
Given the more attractive interest rate condi -
tions, general government deposits with the 
Bundesbank grew from close to zero17 in 2014 
to an average of €57 billion in 2019. This devel -
opment largely reflects the fact that individual 
entities shifted a significant volume of liquid 
funds to the central bank. In parallel, however, 
the general government sector in Germany 
continued to hold a significant volume of bal -
ances and time deposits with commercial 
banks. According to the consolidated financial 
statement of the Eurosystem, these increased 
from €196 billion to €247 billion over the same 
period.18
In connection with the coronavirus pandemic, 
general government then continued to rapidly 
and extensively build up its deposits with the 
Bundesbank, temporarily reaching up to €279 
billion over the course of 2020 (see also the 
box on pp. 18 ff.).

16 The 2008 and 2009 editions of the Bundesbank’s An -

ket Stabilisation Fund (SoFFin) as central government spe -
cial funds. In May 2009, general government deposits 
briefly peaked at €36 billion.
17 General government balances held at the Bundesbank 
averaged €1 billion in 2014.
18 According to the consolidated financial statement, 
deposits  with European banks by entities in the general 
government sector increased from €196 billion to €247 bil -
lion between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth 
quarter of 2019, then fell slightly from 2020 onwards be -
fore rising to more than €280 billion over the course of 
2022 (see https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_

central banks was already above €100 billion, 
reaching a temporary high of €174 billion in 
2009. Due to changed interest arrangements 
with the transition to negative key interest 
rates and the trend increase in excess liquidity, 
general government deposits with the Euro -
system central banks rose from an average of 
€83 billion in 2014 to €258 billion in 2019. 
General government deposits with the Euro -
system central banks peaked at €810 billion in 
September 2020 during the coronavirus pan -
demic.19
Up to July 2022, general government balances 
with the Bundesbank and the Eurosystem cen -
tral banks as a whole remained at an unpreced -
ented historic high. With the prospect of the 
deposit facility rate returning to positive terri -
tory and interest rates then being less attractive 
in comparison, the general government sector 
began to rapidly withdraw or reduce its de -
posits. On balance, general government de -
posits with the Bundesbank had already re -
ceded to well below €100 billion in the first 
quarter of 2023. In parallel, general govern -
ment balances fell to below €400 billion on ag -
gregate across the Eurosystem.Investment conditions for 
general government in the 
money market
In mid-  2022, general government deposits at 
the Bundesbank began to fall. The foreseeable 
transition to positive deposit facility rates 
caused a relative improvement in market condi -
tions from the investors’ perspective and an in -
crease in the availability of alternative forms of 
investment for the general government sector. 
Such alternatives include secured and un -
secured investments in the money market. The 
German money market statistics show that, be -
fore the pandemic, entities assigned to the 
general government sector,20 such as central 
government, state government and local gov -
ernment, as well as other institutional units 
such as public health insurers, held over €50 
billion of unsecured investments in the money 
market. These declined slightly over the course 
of the pandemic, then rose again up to the be -
ginning of 2023, temporarily exceeding €100 
billion.

The liquidity position of general government, taking the 
example of central government
From 2014 to 2019, central government did 
not need to take on any net new debt – 
borrowing was solely for the purpose of 
rolling over maturing Federal securities. 
Even in this environment, central govern-
ment utilised short- term liquidity funding 
and made deposits1 to balance its central 
bank account. According to the Federal 
Ministry of Finance, liquidity borrowing 
largely comprised secured borrowing, as 
this was subject to lower interest rates.2
At the end of the 2014-19 period, deposits 
of roughly €30 billion were offset by re-
course to liquidity borrowing of around €20 
billion. The balance of liquidity borrowing 
and deposits, which is also calculated at 
monthly intervals, thus fl  uctuated in the 
range of €10 billion (see the chart below), 
meaning that deposits exceeded recourse 
to liquidity borrowing. A positive balance 
means that central government’s deposits 
are either invested in the money market at 
least to this extent or are held as account 
balances with commercial banks or the cen-
tral bank. In cases where the balance is positive, the size of the deposits is at least 
equal to the balance, but usually signifi  -
cantly higher. Outstanding liquidity borrow-
ing reduces the balance but is not always 
utilised in full.3
It should be noted that, prior to 2015, cen-
tral government held barely any deposits in 
the form of account balances with the 
Bundesbank. Instead, it placed liquid funds 
in the secured money market, amongst 
other things.4 While large general govern-
ment deposits were built up on the Bundes-

ment’s total cash holdings in connection with debt

ket, account balances held with commercial banks and

with signifi  cant deposits in the years after the turn of 
the millennium.

term deposits predominantly take the form of repur-
chase agreements and are therefore secured (see

bank’s balance sheet between 2015 and 
2019, the deposits reported by central gov-
ernment at the end of each year appear to 
be broadly constant compared with the 
period immediately prior to 2015. Against 
this background, it is reasonable to con-
clude that the increase in general govern-
ment deposits between 2015 and 2019 is 
also attributable to transfers of account bal-
ances from the money market to the central 
bank balance sheet, as central govern-
ment’s liquidity position did not expand sig-
nifi  cantly during this period (see the chart 
on p. 18).
In order to counter the economic conse-
quences of the coronavirus pandemic, gen-
eral government provided extensive fi  scal 
assistance starting in the spring of 2020. 
There was a high degree of uncertainty 
about the exact timing and the level of out-
fl  ows. Against the backdrop of sharply in-
creased but uncertain borrowing require-
ments, central government’s holdings of 
liquid funds grew and the volume of liquid-
ity borrowing permitted under the Budget 
Act was expanded.5 In addition, the Ger-
man Finance Agency – also covered by an 
adjustment in the Budget Act – increased its 
own holdings of Federal securities. These 
retained securities allow for more fl  exible 
market positioning on the part of the 
Finance Agency. The holdings are also avail-
able for securities repurchase agreements 
(repos) for fi  nancing purposes6 or securities 
lending (with the aim of alleviating short-
ages in the securities markets). The Finance 
Agency’s increased securities lending activ-
ity can be seen in the cash collateral ac-
cepted where the volume of both liquidity 
borrowing and short- term balances at the 
Finance Agency have gone up. However, a 
large part of the additional borrowing re-
quirements was covered by a greater issu-
ance of securities in all maturity segments. 
Central government’s issuance of Federal securities with maturities of up to one year 
(Treasury discount paper, or Bubills; see the 
chart above) saw a particularly sharp in-
crease.7
Through these measures, a signifi  cant short- 
term liquidity reserve was built up. This is 
refl  ected, fi  rst, in the deposits in the Federal 
Ministry of Finance’s fi  nancial statements 
and, second, in the signifi  cantly higher gen-
eral government account balances held 
with the Bundesbank. Whether it was an in-
vestment at market interest rates or a de-
posit at the central bank, holding this liquid-
ity reserve generated interest income for 
central government. The higher the share 
of funds held on the central bank account, 
the greater this income, as money market

rates such as the €STR were lower than the 
deposit facility rate during this period.8 
Overnight borrowing backed by Bunds on 
the repo market was possible at rates well 
below the deposit rate applicable when pla-
cing the borrowed funds in the central bank 
account. The asset swap spread9 of Bunds 
versus the €STR, i.e. the yield spread ex-
pected by the market between central gov-
ernment borrowing and daily investment of 
borrowed funds in the money market, was 
at times considerable for short- dated Bunds. 
Even at the start of 2023, the yield on two- 
year Bunds, for example, was signifi  cantly 
lower than the two- year €STR swap rate 
less 20 basis points. Under such circum-stances, investing borrowed funds on the 
capital market at market conditions or de-
positing them in the central bank account 
would both be profi  table transactions for 
the Finance Agency, all else being equal 
(see the upper adjacent chart).
As a result of the growing shortage of 
Bunds in the repo market, the Finance 
Agency has also considerably expanded its 
activities in this market (including securities 
lending) since 2020. The further increase in 
own holdings in October 2022 (see the 
lower adjacent chart) took place against the 
backdrop of “extraordinary fi  nancing needs 
[…] as part of the Federal government’s set 
of measures to address the energy crisis” 
and for use in repo market trading. The 
focus was on securities that were “particu-
larly in demand in the current market envir-
onment”.10 A portion of central govern-
ment’s liquid funds is therefore likely to be 
attributable to repos – conducted to meet 
this demand and to avoid excessive fl  uctu-
ations in repo rates – in which the Finance 
Agency borrows some funds in exchange 
for Federal securities.
8 Until the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) was 
discontinued on 3 January 2022, the deposit facility 
rate was the relevant rate for the remuneration of cen-
tral bank balances held by general government in the 
negative interest rate policy period; see Guideline 
ECB/ 2019/ 7.
9 The asset swap spread is the difference between the 
interest rate swap rate and the yield on a matched ma-
turity bond. A Bund asset swap spread combines the 
purchase of a fi  xed interest Bund with an interest rate 
hedge using an interest rate swap and refl  ects not only 
demand for interest rate hedging but also the general 
liquidity situation. See also Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022b).

posits totalling just under €20 billion in the un -
secured money market. The interest rates on 
the vast majority of overnight deposits are al -
ready higher than the €STR minus 20 basis 
points – i.e. they are above the ceiling on re -
muneration predominantly relevant for general 
government deposits as of May 2023. In most 
cases, outstanding investments with longer 
maturities were even concluded with an inter -
est rate above the €STR swap curve on the re -
spective trading day. Larger entities such as 
state governments tend to be able to make in -
vestments with significantly higher rates than 
smaller entities such as local governments. In 
the general government sector, there is often a 
preference for investments at associated insti -
tutions such as Landesbanken or promotional 
banks.
In various secured money market segments, 
too, short- term investments at rates above the 
€STR minus 20 basis points have become pos -
sible again. In the GC Pooling segment,21 for 
example, the total volume invested in the over -
night money segment has recently grown sig -
nificantly – and at rates that are well above the 
Eurosystem’s interest rate ceiling for remuner -
ation of government deposits (excluding the 
year- end).22 Furthermore, longer- term invest -
ments in this segment have proved possible 
again recently, which also points to increased 
market activity.23 Since the beginning of the 
year, interest rates on investments backed by 
Federal securities have become comparatively 
attractive again, too. According to the German 
money market statistics, transactions con -
cluded with rates above the €STR minus 20 
basis points accounted for a significant share of 
the trading volume in this segment in February 
and March.
Interest rates on general 
government deposits in the 
current market environment
The Governing Council justified the initially 
positive remuneration ceiling for general gov -ernment deposits by expressing its concern 
that, in the event of zero remuneration, the 
majority of these deposits might suddenly be 
withdrawn and shifted primarily to the secured 
money market. An abrupt outflow of deposits 
might have exacerbated the incipient collateral 
scarcity in some segments of the repo market 
because, from the perspective of general gov -
ernment, investing liquid funds in the repo 
market is a comparatively safe alternative to 
central bank deposits. This might have contrib -
uted to a further marked decline in repo rates 
(compared with the key interest rate level). Fur -
thermore, this could potentially have spread to 
other secured and unsecured money market 
segments to an extent that was undesirable 
from a monetary policy perspective.24 If certain 
secured money market rates had systematically 
fallen behind the key interest rate path, this 
would initially have counteracted the monetary 
policy tightening planned in autumn 2022. The 
ECB Governing Council therefore considered it 
necessary to adjust the remuneration ceiling in 
September 2022 in order to ensure the effect -
iveness of monetary policy transmission. This 
adjustment ultimately contributed to a slight Some unsecured

21 According to Eurex Clearing AG, individual entities in 
the general government sector also have access to the GC 
Pooling segment. A list of clearing participants with access 
to the GC Pooling segment can be found at  https://www.

22 In the reserve maintenance period ending on 7 Febru -
ary, overnight money volumes averaged €4.1 billion in the 
ECB Basket and €3.9 billion in the ECB EXTended Basket, al -
though trading volumes recorded on public holidays and at 
year- end were significantly lower. See Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2023a), p. 28. Furthermore, there were also notable 
daily trading volumes in the GC Pooling Tomorrow Next 
and Spot Next segments.
23 Recently, for example, the STOXX GC Pooling longer-  
term indices, which are based both on concluded transac -
tions and on (binding) quotes, recorded enduringly positive 
index turnover (measured in € billion) for maturities of one 
week, one month or three months.
24 Possible mechanisms include evasive movements to 
neighbouring (collateral) segments of the secured money 
market, and transactions in the secured money market po -
tentially being taken into account in the calculation of cer -
tain reference interest rates. Furthermore, zero remuner -
ation on general government deposits might have made it 
more difficult for the Finance Agency to provide securities 
against cash collateral in the context of securities lending, 
which would also have reduced the supply of certain secur -
ities in the repo market.Deutsche Bundesbank

easing in the secured money market, which 
continued over the first quarter of 2023.25
Within the ceilings established by the ECB Gov -
erning Council, the respective national central 
banks or the ECB set the remuneration on gen -
eral government deposits. First, the decisions 
of the national central banks must take into ac -
count the objectives of the relevant decisions 
of the Governing Council. Second, based on 
the considerations already mentioned at the 
beginning of this article (including compatibility 
with market economy principles and the pro -
hibition of monetary financing) and in the inter -
est of proportionality, remuneration should 
only be as high as is necessary to achieve the 
specific objectives being pursued. In the period 
between September 2022 and April 2023, the 
Bundesbank is therefore remunerating general 
government deposits at the deposit facility rate 
minus 20 basis points or the €STR, whichever is 
lower. The remuneration set by the Bundes -
bank was thus mostly around 10 basis points 
below the remuneration ceiling put in place by 
the ECB Governing Council. In view of current 
market conditions, the remuneration on de -
posits applicable at the Bundesbank from May 
2023 onwards with the remuneration ceiling 
set by the Governing Council, i.e. the €STR 
minus 20 basis points,26 is also likely to provide 
the incentives now needed for a gradual and 
orderly transfer of deposits to the money mar -
ket.Conclusion
General government deposits with the Bundes -
bank have now fallen back significantly from 
the highs reached during the coronavirus pan -
demic. To a certain extent, account holders 
now have attractive investment options in the 
market again. The general government sector 
is therefore likely to continue shifting liquid 
funds to commercial banks in the second quar -
ter of 2023 given the growing interest rate in -
centives. The reduction of monetary policy 
asset holdings as part of the normalisation of 
monetary policy is instrumental in limiting the 
risk of this foreseeable and desirable develop -
ment having an adverse impact on money mar -
ket conditions.
From the Bundesbank’s perspective, it would 
make sense to reinstate the zero remuneration 
policy for general government deposits further 
down the line. This is appropriate given that 
these deposits do not fulfil a monetary policy 
function. Instead, carrying accounts for general 
government entities is a service offered by the 
Bundesbank which, in tandem with the services 
offered by private and public banks, supports 
and safeguards the fulfilment of general gov -
ernment tasks.National central

Household wealth and finances in 
 Germany: Results of the 2021 household 
wealth survey
For ten years now, the Bundesbank has been surveying households in Germany about their 
wealth, debt, and income. The “Panel on Household Finances” (PHF) survey, which is conducted 
at intervals of around three years, provides valuable insight and data for the Bundesbank’s 
research and policy work. The survey continued during the coronavirus pandemic, although the 
fourth survey, which was originally planned for 2020, was postponed until 2021. Around four-  
fifths of the 4,119 respondents in the fourth wave had already participated in at least one of the 
previous surveys.
Between 2017 and 2021, asset holdings increased on a broad basis once again. In particular, 
households with low wealth saw strong growth in proportion to their existing holdings. This is 
one of the reasons for the slight reduction in net wealth inequality from 2017 to 2021. There had 
already been signs of this decline in inequality between 2014 and 2017. By European standards, 
however, the distribution of net wealth remains unequal.
The structure of wealth and debt has hardly changed across the wealth distribution. Owner ship 
of real estate and businesses continues to be strongly correlated with high levels of wealth. By 
contrast, the wealth of less wealthy households consists primarily of balances on savings accounts 
and other low- risk forms of investment.
Both the share of households with debt and the share of households with negative net wealth, 
where outstanding debts exceed gross wealth, declined in 2021 compared with 2017. The share 
of income spent on interest and repayments for loans fell for a large number of indebted house -
holds over the same period.
The results presented here end in 2021. Since that time, there have been some developments rele -
vant to household wealth and debt, such as rising interest rates in the course of monetary policy 
normalisation. The impact of these changes on household saving, investment, and debt behav -
iour is to be captured by the next wave of the survey in 2023.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
This article presents selected results from the 
Bundesbank’s 2021 Panel on Household 
Finances survey of German households and 
compares them with the results from previous 
years (2010-11, 2014, 2017). In this context, the 
development of wealth distribution, saving and 
investment behaviour, and the debt situation 
among households in Germany are at the 
centre of interest. The analyses largely focus on 
describing the distribution and composition of 
wealth, and therefore, when taken in isolation, 
do not allow for any conclusions regarding 
causal relationships to be drawn.
The survey, which was postponed to 2021 due 
to the coronavirus pandemic, was conducted 
mostly by telephone; previous surveys had 
been conducted as face- to- face interviews on 
location. In addition, the number of house -
holds participating in this wave that had al -
ready taken part in previous surveys was larger 
in relative terms.1 The results from 2021 should 
nevertheless be broadly comparable with those 
from previous years.
Wealth distribution in 2021 
compared with previous years
The years 2020 and 2021 were characterised 
by the coronavirus pandemic and the measures 
taken to contain it – such as lockdowns, res -
taurant closures, and travel restrictions – which 
limited households’ opportunities for consump -
tion and led to additional saving. The pandemic 
was also accompanied by a sharp rise in short- 
time work, high volatility in the financial mar -
kets, and other developments that were poten -
tially relevant to the economic and financial 
situations of households. Through a variety of 
measures, the German Federal Government at -
tempted to mitigate the impact of the pan -
demic and, for example, stabilise household in -
comes. Some developments relevant to wealth 
and debt continued despite the crisis. For ex -
ample, real estate prices appreciated sharply between 2017 and 2021, and key interest rates 
remained at low levels. Share prices also rose 
significantly overall between 2017 and 2021.
At €316,500 in nominal terms,2 average net 
wealth reached a new record high since the 
launch of the survey ten years ago. Between 
2017 and 2021 alone, average wealth grew by 
around €83,600 (+36%).3 Since 2010-11, 
household wealth has increased by just over 
€121,300 (+62%) on average. Median net 
wealth, which marks the middle of the wealth 
distribution and divides households into a 
richer half and a poorer half,4 also swelled con -
siderably once again, rising from €70,800 in 
2017 to €106,600 in 2021. Viewed over the 
long term here, too, this represents an increase Household net 
wealth (mean 
and median) 
increased 
sharply
1 A higher participation rate among households that had 
already taken part in previous waves could potentially over -
state the stability of any highlighted structures. However, 
there is no clear indication that this is the case. The weight -
ing of the data takes account of the difference in the will -
ingness to participate among households that have been 
surveyed multiple times and households that are being sur -
veyed for the first time. In addition, the sample does not 
consist solely of households that have been surveyed mul -
tiple times: 685 of the 4,119 households that participated 
in this survey were first- time respondents. For more details 
on the methodology, see the box on pp. 30 f.
2 Unless stated otherwise, these and all other values in this 
article are expressed in nominal terms, i.e. they have not 
been adjusted for inflation. For a discussion on the inflation 
adjustment of wealth, see the box on p. 33.
3 This is a reflection of developments in the aggregate stat -
istics of wealth in the household sector including non-  
profit institutions serving households between 2017 and 
2021. According to this calculation method, total net 
worth, which is defined slightly differently, grew from 
€12.397 trillion to €16.605 trillion (+34%) between 2017 
and 2021. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a) and Deutsche 
Bundesbank and Federal Statistical Office (2022).
4 In order to ascertain the median, households are first 
sorted by wealth in ascending order. The household wealth 
figure in the middle of this range constitutes the median. 
Based on the order of households sorted according to 
wealth, further parameters can be obtained (known as 
quantiles). A breakdown into five equal parts at 20%, 
40%, 60% and 80% yields the quintiles, and a breakdown 
into ten equal parts yields the deciles.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

of more than 100% compared with 2010-11 
(€51,400).5
The rises in both the median and the mean 
were particularly sharp in the period between 
2017 and 2021. Here, it should be taken into 
consideration that, in this instance, the interval 
between the waves was not three years, but 
four.6 Furthermore, in the 2021 sample, the 
share of households that had been surveyed 
multiple times (panel households) was signifi -
cantly higher than in previous waves (see also 
the box on pp. 30 f.). As the panel households 
had higher median wealth than the first- time 
respondents, it is possible that wealth in 2021 
has been overestimated and this overesti -
mation may not have been fully offset by 
weighting the data.
The fact that the mean exceeds the median is a 
typical characteristic of wealth distributions, 
and the ratio of the mean to the median pro -
vides an initial indication of how unequally 
wealth is distributed.7 Between 2017 and 2021, 
this ratio fell slightly from 3.3 to 3.0. Other 
ratios between different parts of the wealth 
distribution also indicate a slight decline in in -
equality.8 For instance, the ratio of the cut- off 
value above which a household belongs to the 
wealthiest 10% of households in Germany 
(90th percentile, 2021: €725,900) to the me -
dian (2021: €106,600) declined from 7.8 to 6.8 
in the latest survey. The higher the value, the 
more steeply the net wealth of households in 
the middle of the distribution would have to 
rise in order for them to rank among the 
wealthiest 10% of households. Similarly, the 
Gini coefficient9 for net wealth – a traditional 
measure of inequality – also suggests that the 
inequality of wealth distribution is in slight de -
cline, standing at 73% in 2021. By comparison, 
the Gini coefficient was 74% in 2017 and 76% 
in 2010-11.
In discussions about the long- term develop -
ment of wealth distributions, the academic lit -
erature has also increasingly looked at the 
share of total net wealth held by very wealthy households.10 The share of net wealth held by 
the wealthiest 10% of households has changed 
only marginally over the past four years. The 
wealthiest 10% of households continue to hold Wealth distribu -

more equal than 
in the past

5 International comparisons are only possible with a few 
countries. Thus far, figures on net wealth are only available 
for Spain, Italy and Portugal for 2020. As in previous years, 
the mean values across Spain, Italy and Germany differ less 
significantly than the medians. In 2020, Italy had a mean of 
€341,000 and a median of €150,800; Spain had a mean of 
€269,900 and a median of €122,000. With a median of 
€101,200 in 2020, Portugal attained roughly the same level 
as Germany, although its mean of €200,400 was signifi -
cantly lower than its German counterpart. For Spain, see 
Banco de España (2022); for Italy, see Banca d’Italia (2022);

of wealth do not include entitlements to statutory pensions 
(see also the box on p. 28).
6 For the period from 2017 to 2021, average annual 
growth was around 8% for the mean and 11% for the me -
dian. By comparison, between 2014 and 2017, the mean 
rose by an average of 3% per year, while the median rose 
by 5% per year.
7 Mean net wealth is strongly influenced by extreme val -
ues. A high ratio of the mean to the median therefore sug -
gests that wealth in the upper part of the distribution is 
considerably greater than in the middle.
8 Also according to the Distributional Wealth Accounts, 
which combine data from the PHF survey with the national 
accounts statistics, wealth inequality has fallen marginally 
since 2014. Overall, however, they still indicate that wealth 
inequality is high. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a).
9 The Gini coefficient generally takes a value between 0% 
and 100%, where 0% represents perfect equality –  all 
households have equally high net wealth – and 100% rep -
resents maximum inequality – all wealth belongs to one 
household. The closer the figure is to 100%, the more un -
equal the distribution. If negative values are also included 
in the calculation, it is also possible for the Gini coefficient 
to take a value greater than 100%.

The PHF’s defi  nition of wealth
The objective of the PHF study is to compile 
and present detailed information on the 
wealth of German households.1 The PHF 
study’s defi  nition of wealth is therefore de-
signed to capture both the assets and the 
liabilities on households’ balance sheets. 
The assets side (“gross wealth”) consists of 
real assets and fi  nancial assets. The other 
side of the balance sheet lists liabilities, i.e. 
loans secured by real estate and unsecured 
loans. Net wealth is calculated as the differ-
ence between gross wealth and debt.
The data on asset types captured in the PHF 
is more granular than those in other wealth- 
related studies. Real assets, for example, in-
clude not only real estate and business 
ownership but also the value of vehicles, 
collections and jewellery. There is compre-
hensive coverage of fi  nancial assets as well. 
These consist of balances with banks, sav-ings banks, and building and loan associ-
ations, securities, long- term equity invest-
ment and assets under management. The 
positive balances from private pension and 
life insurance policies are also included.2
Any future claims to a statutory pension are 
not included. As Germany has a pay- as- 
you- go pension system, these only consti-
tute claims, not accumulated wealth. How-
ever, with a variety of assumptions on life 
expectancy, interest rate developments and 
the retirement age, it would be possible to 
convert future entitlements for individual 
types of statutory pension provision into 
assets (to capitalise them). Such simulations 
show that wealth inequality is smaller when 
looking at wealth including statutory pen-
sion provision than it is when statutory pen-
sion provision is not included.3
Households evaluate their assets them-
selves. This is mainly relevant for real estate 
and business ownership. In both cases, 
households are asked what price they think 
they could achieve for their property or 
business if they were to sell it.
Assets held abroad are also included in the 
calculation of a household’s total assets if 
the respondents report this information.
1 The PHF defi  nes households as groups of persons 
who live at the same address and share daily expenses. 
Persons who temporarily do not live at that address 
but regularly return there are also considered part of 
the household. Persons or groups of persons who live 
in a shared residence without having a family or part-
nership relationship, or domestic staff residing at that 
address, constitute households in their own right.
2 Households’ wealth includes private pension and life 
insurance policies in the accumulation phase or where 
contributions have been suspended. They are removed 
from households’ balance sheets once payouts from 
the policies commence, and the relevant fl  ows of in-
come are then taken into account when calculating in-
come.

56% of total net wealth.11 However, compared 
with ten years ago, the levels of these indica -
tors have also fallen: in 2010-11, the wealthiest 
10% of the distribution still held 59% of total 
net wealth.
Even after the decline in the aforementioned 
indicators of inequality, inequality in Germany 
remains high by European standards. The ratio 
of the mean to the median was just over 2 in 
Italy, Spain, and Portugal in 2020, whereas in 
Germany in 2021, it was 3. The ratio of the me -
dian to the cut- off value for the wealthiest 
10% of the distribution was 4.5 in Italy, 4.1 in Portugal, but 6.8 in Germany. Furthermore, the 
Gini coefficients in Italy (68%) and Portugal 
(66%) were lower than in Germany (73%).12 
The most recent figures on wealth distribution 
in the United States are from 2019.13 Including 
these figures for comparison reveals that net 
wealth distribution in the United States is sig -
nificantly more unequal than in Germany (share 
of net wealth held by the wealthiest 10%: 
76%; mean/ median: 6).
The absolute spreads between certain parts of 
the distribution have continued to widen. For 
example, the spread between the least wealthy Inequality

10% of the distribution is underestimated (see Vermeulen 
(2018), Deutsche Bundesbank (2013, 2022b), Schröder et 
al. (2020), and Chakraborty and Waltl (2018)). Assuming 
that the degree of underreporting is similarly pronounced 
in each of the individual reporting years, the results are 
comparable across years. The approach behind the Panel 
on Household Finances (PHF) study is to overrepresent 
wealthy households in the unweighted sample (see the box 
on pp. 30 f.). This goal has generally been achieved. How -
ever, as in most other comparable surveys, very wealthy 
households are missing from the PHF, too. None of the 
households surveyed in the PHF possess wealth amounting 
to €100 million or more. This underreporting is also not 
offset through the weighting of the data. Very wealthy 
households are taken into account when calculating the 
Distributional Wealth Accounts. Here, too, the share of 
total net wealth held by the wealthiest 10% of households 
is largely stable, but is somewhat higher at around 60%.

PHF study 2021: Methodology of the fourth survey
The fourth PHF survey was originally sched-
uled for the spring and summer of 2020 but 
was postponed to 2021 due to the corona-
virus pandemic. Given that the social dis-
tancing requirements associated with the 
pandemic were largely still in effect in 2021, 
the methodology used in the PHF study was 
adjusted. Whereas in the three previous 
waves of the survey (2010-11, 2014, and 
2017) household interviews could only be 
conducted face to face with respondents 
on location, telephone interviews were also 
an option in the 2021 survey. In fact, the 
majority of the total 4,119 interviews were 
conducted by telephone (3,783). The tele-
phone version of the survey questionnaire 
differed only slightly from the face- to- face 
questionnaire. In particular, it was not pos-
sible to make use of printed lists with spe-
cifi  c response options that would be shown to interviewees in face- to- face interviews. 
The interviewers instead had to read the 
lists out aloud over the telephone. There 
were hardly any changes to the content of 
the questionnaire compared with the previ-
ous waves, ensuring that the questions and 
concepts are comparable with those from 
previous waves. For the 2021 survey, ques-
tions regarding the impact of the corona-
virus pandemic on respondents’ fi  nancial 
situations were added to the usual ques-
tionnaire (see the box on p. 35).
The period for conducting interviews was 
extended in order for a suffi   cient number of 
interviews to be completed. The survey, 
which was originally scheduled for March 
to October 2020, was ultimately carried out 
between April 2021 and early January 2022.
Despite offering to conduct the survey by 
telephone, only limited success was had in 
getting new households that had never 
been interviewed before to take part in the 
survey. As a result, households that had al-
ready participated in at least one of the pre-
vious surveys (2010-2011, 2014, or 2017) 
make up around 83% of the completed 
interviews. This fi  gure is unusually high and 
is attributable to the fact that only a small 
number of households could be motivated 
to participate for the fi  rst time during the 
coronavirus pandemic. In the previous 
wave, the share of households that had 
been surveyed repeatedly was around two- 
thirds. The adjacent table provides an over-
view of the composition of the completed 
interviews in the individual years as well as 
the participation rates of individual groups.

ology brought about by the coronavirus

appear to be comparable with those of the 
previous waves.1
Irrespective of the above- mentioned adjust-
ments, a slight change to the sampling con-
cept for newly selected households had al-
ready been planned for 2020 in order to en-
sure better coverage of Germany’s eastern 
federal states. This was achieved through 
oversampling, meaning that households 
resident in the eastern federal states were 
overrepresented in the gross sample. As a 
result, wealthy households were oversam-
pled to a lesser extent than in the previous 
waves.2 However, this does not mean that 
only a small number of wealthy households 
was included among the completed inter-
views. In the group of households that have 
been surveyed repeatedly, the share of 
wealthy households in all households had 
been rising steadily over time, so it seemed 
unnecessary to signifi  cantly oversample 
these households again for the fourth 
wave.
The higher probabilities of selection for 
wealthy households and households in 
eastern Germany were taken into account 
in the weighting, so that the results shown 
can be regarded as representative of house-
holds in Germany.
No adjustments were made to any other as-
pects of the methodology.
In 2021, as in previous years, the target 
population again included households with 
at least one person over the age of 18, but 
did not include people living in collective 
households (e.g. retirement homes or refu-
gee homes) or institutions (e.g. monasteries 
or prisons).
The addresses of households approached 
for the fi  rst time were once again selected 
randomly from lists held by residence regis-tration offi   ces. The data were collected 
using electronic questionnaires. The just 
under 250 trained interviewers required a 
little over an hour on average to complete 
an interview.
Further information on the methodology 
and background of the PHF survey can be 
found at https://www.bundesbank.de/en/
bundesbank/research/panel-on-household-
finances.
1 It is diffi   cult to carry out a formal review of the ef-
fects of the methodological changes using the avail-
able data. Not least, a comparison between the house-
holds surveyed in person and those surveyed by tele-
phone is not possible due to the low number of re-
spondents in the fi  rst group.
2 When drawing the sample, income tax statistics are 
used to divide smaller municipalities with fewer than 
100,000 residents into “rich municipalities” and “other 
municipalities”. In cities with 100,000 residents or 
more, wealthy street sections are identifi  ed using 
micro- geographic information on location and pur-
chasing power. Finally, the proportion of households in 
the sample is selected such that households in wealthy 
municipalities and wealthy street sections are oversam-
pled in relation to their numbers in the population.Deutsche Bundesbank

25% of the net wealth distribution and the 
wealthiest 25% widened to €337,700, repre -
senting an increase of almost 30% compared 
with 2017. This gap had already widened sig -
nificantly between 2014 and 2017. Even if the 
wealth of all households were to rise by the 
same factor or percentage, this spread would 
increase, while the relative measures of in -
equality discussed above (such as the Gini co-
efficient, etc.) would remain unchanged.
The data from the PHF study also allow individ -
ual parts of the wealth distribution to be ana -
lysed.14 As the above chart shows, asset hold -
ings rose significantly in almost all parts of the 
distribution.
In absolute terms, the largest increases were 
observed among the wealthier households, but 
less wealthy households also recorded growth 
between 2017 and 2021. In nominal terms, this 
growth was weaker than in the upper portion 
of the distribution; in percentage terms, how -
ever, it was actually greater than that among 
the wealthy households. In order to be counted 
among the wealthiest 10% of households in 
Germany in 2021, a household required a net 
wealth of around €725,900 (+31%). In 2017, 
this cut- off value was still only €555,700.In 2017, a household was already among the 
wealthiest 80% of households with net wealth 
of just over €3,000; in 2021, €6,900 was re -
quired to belong to this group. Average net 
wealth within the bottom 20% of the net 
wealth distribution also rose, although it re -
mained in negative territory at -€3,100 (2017: 
-€6,800). In addition, the share of households 
with no or negative net wealth decreased by 
2.4 percentage points from 8.9% to 6.5% be -
tween 2017 and 2021. Back in 2014, this figure 
was still 10%.
The inflow of funds onto current and savings 
accounts is an important factor behind the in -
crease in the wealth of less wealthy house -
holds, which predominantly hold liquid invest -
ment forms. As shown in the table on p. 34, al -
though the percentage of households holding 
certain types of financial assets (“prevalence”) 
has not changed in this group, the average 
holdings on current and savings accounts of 
households in the less wealthy 20% of the dis -
tribution have increased significantly. House -Net wealth

14 Looking at individual parts of the wealth distribution 
does not provide any indication of the extent to which the 
positions of individual households in the distribution have 
changed over time. The composition of the households in 
the individual segments of the distribution may change 
from year to year. Nevertheless, a rise in the percentile cut- 
off values suggests that net asset holdings have grown for 
a large number of households.Deutsche Bundesbank

Infl  ation and wealth
The results presented in this article in euro 
amounts are expressed in current prices in 
each case, i.e. they are nominal. This ap-
proach was likewise chosen in the previous 
reports on the PHF study. From mid- 2021 
onwards, consumer price infl  ation rose well 
above the 2% mark again for the fi  rst time 
in a long period. While the cumulative infl  a-
tion rate, as measured by the annual aver-
age of the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP), stood at 6.7% between 2010 
and 2014 and at 2.7% between 2014 and 
2017, it amounted to 7.2% for the period 
2017 to 2021.
Nevertheless, the main section of this article 
provides no infl  ation- adjusted results. Cal-
culating infl  ation- adjusted wealth measures 
is not without its problems as there is no 
generally accepted price index for wealth. It 
is also questionable whether it makes sense 
to adjust all data using only one price index 
or whether different (yield) indices should 
be used for different types of assets and 
debt. As an expedient, assets are therefore 
usually adjusted for infl  ation using the HICP . 
If the PHF fi  gures were also adjusted in this 
way, the mean and median values for net 
wealth would be as shown in the chart 
below.
Infl  ation adjustment is not of central im-
portance when analysing developments in 
inequality. This is especially true where rela-
tive measures of inequality are considered, 
such as the Gini coeffi   cient, the ratio be-
tween the mean and median, or the P90/ 
P50 ratio. As long as all wealth components 
are adjusted using the same factor, there is 
no change in the relative measures of in-
equality.In addition to these aspects that are more 
relevant when comparing statistical results 
across the individual waves, infl  ation devel-
opments in general may play a role in 
households’ wealth. If rising infl  ation is ac-
companied by rising interest rates or wages, 
this can affect not only households’ con-
sumption and saving behaviour, it also im-
pacts debtors and savers in different ways. 
For instance, infl  ation leads to a redistribu-
tion of the real value of nominal fi  nancial 
assets and liabilities within the household 
sector. Adam and Zhu (2016)1 show, for ex-
ample, that in Germany, the poorest house-
holds, defi  ned on the basis of their income 
and wealth, risk the greatest losses in the 
event of surprise infl  ation. In the euro area 
as a whole, infl  ation causes wealthy older 
households the greatest losses, as they hold 
comparatively more nominal assets (cash 
and liquid assets) and have less debt. The 
main benefi  ts in the euro area accrue to 
younger middle- class households, since 
they have higher levels of net debt (mostly 
mortgage debt).

hold debt among this group also fell slightly on 
average, although the percentage of indebted 
households remained unchanged.15 These de -
velopments are consistent with an elevated 
saving ratio due to the limited spending oppor -
tunities during the coronavirus pandemic.
It remains to be seen how the coronavirus pan -
demic will continue to affect the situation of 
households in the medium to long term. In the 
short term, the pandemic appears to have im -
pacted mainly the level of wealth, rather than 
its distribution and basic structures. Given that, 
as early as 2021, only around one- fifth of 
households reported that they had suffered 
losses of wages and income during the corona -
virus pandemic and only 3% reported other 
financial losses (see the box on pp. 35f.), more 
fundamental changes were not to be expected.
Wealth situation of certain 
groups of households16
Ownership of real estate and businesses is a 
good indicator for a household’s level of 
wealth. In 2021, the median net wealth of 
households living in their own property reached 
a new record high of €364,800 since the 
launch of the surveys. The median value for 
tenant households also increased compared with 2017, although, at €16,200, it remains 
well below the figure for property owners. The 
rise in real estate prices between 2017 and 
2021 no doubt had an important impact on 
developments in the wealth of property-  
owning households. However, the difference 
between the net wealth of tenants and owners 
is also partly due to the fact that the two differ 
in terms of certain characteristics that are cor -
related with wealth, such as age, household 
size, income, or marital status. Households liv -
ing in owner- occupied properties generally 
comprise older persons than tenant house -
holds. Homeowner households are also some -
what larger owing to the higher share of 
households with couples and households with 
children amongst owners. Furthermore, they 
usually have a higher household income than 
tenants.
Significantly above- average wealth is also 
found amongst owners of businesses.17 The 
average net wealth of these households ex -
ceeds €1 million, with the median amounting 
to €503,600. Around half of the wealth of 
these households, many of which are found in 
the south of Germany, is directly attributable to 
their business ownership. The businesses of 
these households are worth around €502,800 
on average.18
Even decades after reunification, there are still 
marked differences in wealth between eastern 
and western Germany. The median household 
in eastern Germany had net wealth of €43,400 
in 2021 compared with €127,900 in western Only one- fifth of

prises.

The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the fi  nancial 
situation of households in Germany
Using the data from the 2021 PHF survey, it 
is not yet possible to gauge the longer- term 
impact of the coronavirus pandemic on 
households’ fi  nancial situation or – for that 
matter – the distribution of wealth. How-
ever, the 2021 PHF data and an interim pos-
tal survey carried out in 2020 do contain in-
formation on the short- term impact of the 
pandemic on household fi  nances.
Originally scheduled for 2020, the fourth 
main PHF wave had to be postponed until 
2021 due to the pandemic. The Bundes-
bank’s Research Centre, in collaboration 
with infas, carried out a postal interim sur-
vey in 2020 to bridge the gap between the 
last time households in Germany had been 
surveyed on their wealth in 2017 and the 
2021 survey.
This interim survey contains a number of 
specifi  c questions on the impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic on households.1
In the 2020 interim survey, only a few 
households reported having major prob-
lems with the coronavirus pandemic. Only 
around 8% reported that they had gener-
ally coped “poorly” or “very poorly” with 
the coronavirus pandemic up to that point. That said, around 17% reported (major) dif-
fi  culties in making ends meet during the 
coronavirus pandemic, with signifi  cant dif-
ferences along the wealth distribution (see 
the chart below). While 34% of households 
in the bottom quintile of the wealth distri-
bution reported diffi   culties, the correspond-
ing share in the middle of the distribution is 
just 16% and in the upper part of the distri-
bution the share is actually below 10%.
According to the survey, just over one- third 
of households had to deal with loss of in-
come or fi  nancial losses in connection with 
the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the ma-
jority of which were wage losses (see the 
chart on p. 36). The proportion of house-
holds experiencing fi  nancial losses or lost 
wages and salaries has declined over time – 
in the main PHF survey in 2021, only 22% of 
respondents reported having suffered such 
losses. In the 2020 interim survey, it was 
34%. In particular, the share of households 
with fi  nancial losses other than loss of 
1 The interim survey also collected information on the 
structure of household wealth, though did not cover it 
in as much detail as the main survey usually does. The 
different survey method employed for the interim sur-
vey (postal rather than face- to- face interviews) and the 
differences in the design of the questions about wealth 
further limit the comparability of the interim survey 
with the main waves. In particular, it is not possible to 
compare absolute assets over time consistently. How-
ever, the survey results from 2020 provide an impres-
sion of how the coronavirus pandemic has affected 
household fi  nances, including across the wealth distri-
bution. A total of 4,550 households participated in the 
interim survey, most of which had already participated 
in previous survey rounds.Financial difficulties during the

Germany. This means that the gap in terms of 
the median for eastern and western Germany 
has increased in absolute terms, from €69,100 
to €84,500, although the ratio of median 
wealth in the west to the east has decreased 
from four to three. There has thus been a rela -
tively stronger rise from a low level in median 
wealth in eastern Germany (+85%) than in me -
dian wealth in western Germany (+38%). This 
is consistent with the Federal Government’s 
finding that standards of living in eastern and 
western Germany have continued to converge 
over time.19
In the PHF surveys, wealth is recorded at the 
household level, not at the individual level. The 
size and composition of the household there -
fore generally play an important role in its level 
of wealth. Not surprisingly, asset holdings in -
crease with the number of household mem -
bers. However, this correlation no longer ap -
plies to households with five or more persons. 
These are often households with a large num -ber of children, who generally do not have any 
significant wealth holdings.20 Looking at the 
household types in slightly more detail, it can 
be seen that, on average, couples without chil -
dren and couples with children have similar 
wealth (roughly €435,000), but that the me -
dian for couples without children in the house -
hold is significantly higher at €237,200 (couples 
with children: €155,800). Wealth is thus more 
unequally distributed in the group of house -
holds comprising couples with children than in 
the group of households comprising couples 
without children. Two- person households also 
include many single- parent households. Their 
net wealth, at €109,400 on average, is not 
only lower than that of couple households, but Household size 
and composition 
important for 
wealth levelswages or other income fell from 10% in 
2020 to just 3% in 2021.2
Lastly, the interim survey also contained a 
question on saving behaviour during the 
crisis. Here, too, there are differences along the wealth distribution. As expected, the 
share of households that were able to save 
increases along the wealth distribution. 
Nevertheless, 27% of households in the 
bottom 20% of the wealth distribution re-
ported that they were able to save during 
the coronavirus pandemic.
2 Similar patterns also emerged in the Bundesbank’s 
survey on household expectations in Germany 
(Bundesbank Online Panel Households, or BOP- HH), 
which has been conducted at regular intervals since 
April 2020. See Afunts et al. (2022).Financial losses owing to the coronavirus 
pandemic

20 If a household’s wealth is distributed evenly among its 
members, mean per capita net wealth is very similar for 
households with one and two persons, while households 
with five or more persons have the lowest figures. The 
average net wealth for households with three and four per -
sons lies in between.Deutsche Bundesbank

also lower than that of single persons without 
children (€200,300).
Typically, the wealth of a household or an indi -
vidual grows up to a certain age and then de -
creases again.21 Income, too, generally in -
creases as a person grows older and declines 
again from the end of their working life. In 
addition, the composition of households and 
the employment of household members 
change with increasing age, for example. The 
chart on p. 38 shows this life cycle pattern in 
2021. While households with reference per -
sons22 under the age of 25 have a median 
wealth of around €11,400, median wealth in 
the 45-74 age group is between €154,700 and 
€231,000. Median wealth then starts to dimin -
ish, partly because older households tend to 
“dissave” and give away more assets.
Another way of characterising the structure of 
households along the wealth distribution is to 
look at the different parts of the distribution 
and describe the typical characteristics of 
households in each case. The table on p. 39 
shows the percentage of households that are 
homeowners or hold business assets as well as 
the age and gender of the reference person for 
the four PHF waves conducted thus far. It is evi -
dent here that the structure of households in 
the individual parts of the wealth distribution 
has not changed fundamentally over the past 
decade. However, this does not mean that 
there is no variation in individual households’ 
positions in the distribution of wealth. Rather, it 
suggests that the characteristics associated 
with high and low wealth respectively have not 
altered significantly over time.
Structure of household 
wealth and debt
In addition to looking at aggregate net wealth, 
its composition is also important. For monetary 
policy transmission, it is interesting, for ex -
ample, to consider how wealth is distributed 
among savings, securities, and other forms of investment; for financial stability issues, the 
structure of debt plays a role. For instance, the 
effectiveness of monetary policy measures de -
pends, amongst other things, on the distribu -
tion and structure of wealth. Balance sheet 
constraints may also affect the impact of mon -
etary policy measures.23 In addition, different 
types of investment generate different returns, 
which can have an impact on asset holdings.
There were no major changes in the share of 
households possessing certain types of finan -
cial and real assets between 2017 and 2021. 
Only the increase in households investing dir -
ectly in shares or that possess funds is striking. 
The share of households owning shares rose 
from 11% to 15%, while the percentage of 
households holding funds swelled from 16% to 
21%. Younger households also invested more 
in funds and shares. The increase in stock mar -Life cycle pat -

21 For the breakdown by “personal characteristics” shown 
below, households are grouped by reference person and 
the total household wealth is allocated to this person. The 
reference person is generally the person with the highest 
income in the household. If two or more members of a 
household have equally high incomes, one person is se -
lected at random.
22 In this context, the reference person is usually the per -
son with the highest income in the household. If two or 
more members of a household have equally high incomes, 
one person is selected at random.

al. (2021), Matusche and Wacks (2022), and Weidner et al.

ket participation, in particular in 2020, is con -
sistent with results from other studies.24 The 
high stock returns between 2017 and 2021 and 
additional savings during the coronavirus pan -
demic could be one reason for the heightened 
interest in stock market investment.
However, households in Germany still appear 
to have a broad preference for liquid and 
lower- risk forms of investment. This is evident 
in the barely changed share of households with 
savings accounts, which, despite the long 
period of low interest rates that lasted until 
mid- 2022, are still held by 71% of households 
in Germany. Viewed over the longer term, it is 
noticeable that both the share of households 
with savings accounts and of those with pri -
vate pension plans has fallen by 7 percentage 
points and 5  percentage points respectively 
since 2010-11. However, most of this develop -
ment took place between 2010 and 2017.As regards the debt situation, there was a de -
cline in the share of households with mortgage 
loans and/ or unsecured loans. The rise in real 
estate prices made it more difficult for certain 
households to purchase and finance property. 
If fully repaid loans are not replaced by new 
ones, this share would likewise fall. Heightened 
uncertainty during the coronavirus pandemic 
may have also left its mark on both the de -
mand and supply of mortgage loans.
The fact that the average amounts for out -
standing mortgage loans rose from €125,100 
to €148,40025 is in line with higher real estate 
prices. Higher prices meant that households 
purchasing real estate had to take out larger 
loans.
The overall sharp increase in financial assets26 
and, in particular, the inflows to liquid invest -
ment forms, such as savings and current ac -
counts, are also confirmed in the PHF study.
Households’ financial assets, defined as the 
sum of savings and current account balances, 
the value of funds and shares, private pension 
products (including cash value life insurance) 
and other financial assets, went up from an 
average of €56,800 to €77,900 (+37%) be -
tween 2017 and 2021. For the same period, 
the financial accounts show an increase of 
€1.595 trillion in financial assets for the house -
hold sector (+27%).27Overall, still

24 According to Deutsches Aktieninstitut, there were just 
over 10 million owners of shares or equity funds in Ger -
many in 2017 (15.7% of the population aged 14 and over). 
By 2021, the figure had increased to 12.1 million (17.1% of 
the population aged 14 and over). The differences can be 
explained by the fact that individuals, not households, and 
only equity funds, not other types of fund, are considered.

Half of households in Germany had €3,000 or 
more on their current account in 2021. Accord -
ing to the PHF study, the average current ac -
count balance amounted to around €12,700, 
an increase of almost 80% compared with 
2017. The increase for savings accounts was 
somewhat weaker, but here, too, both the me -
dian (€11,800) and the mean (€30,900) have 
risen significantly since the start of the surveys 
in 2010. One question that this raises is the ex -
tent to which the higher level of saving was 
“involuntary” in the sense of being un -
planned,28 as opportunities for consumption 
were limited during the coronavirus pandemic. 
These figures do not directly answer this ques -
tion, but the huge growth in credit balances is 
remarkable nonetheless.
The mean and median values of equity and 
fund ownership also increased significantly. 
This is likely to be due to the sharp rise in the 
stock market index between 2017 and 2021. At 
49%, the rise in the mean value of equity port -folios is roughly as high as the rise in the me -
dian (45%).
The importance of real estate ownership and 
business assets for a household’s position in 
the distribution of wealth has already been 
mentioned above. As evident from the chart on 
p. 41, real estate and business assets are there -
fore also relevant to the composition of wealth 
along the distribution of wealth. Increases or 
decreases in value associated with ownership 
of a property or a business therefore also have 
a major impact on the development of individ -
ual parts of the distribution of wealth and on 
dynamics at the household level.29 Between

almost €85,000, or one- third.30 The median 
rose by two- fifths in the same period from 
€199,200 to €278,800. The rise in the PHF 
study is thus somewhat higher than, for ex -
ample, the increase in the Owner- Occupied 
Housing Price Index. While this index only re -
flects price increases, the PHF shows the appre -
ciation in value.
Between 2017 and 2021, the median value of 
business assets31 increased from €26,600 to 
€48,700.32 However, the share of households 
owning an enterprise also fell. Part of the in -
crease in the median could therefore be attrib -
uted to smaller or less successful firms being 
closed down more often than larger ones.33
Saving and wealth
As indicated in the previous sections, asset 
holdings change as a result of increases in value. Of course, saving behaviour, i.e. the size 
of amounts invested over time, is also a factor.German households’ portfolio structure

30 In the survey, the current hypothetical (resale) value of 
a property is estimated by the households themselves. In 
addition to the current value according to this self-  
assessment, households also state the price they originally 
paid, often quite a long time ago. The difference between 
the two prices is checked for plausibility.
31 The exact wording of the question on business assets is: 
“How much is the business or the company worth after the 
deduction of liabilities? Here I mean: for what amount 
could you sell your stake if you take into account the com -
pany’s assets and deduct the liabilities?” The question has 
remained the same in all waves of the PHF survey.
32 The sharp increase in the mean value of business assets 
as shown in the table points to a problem in collecting data 
on households with very large business assets. Business 
assets are concentrated among wealthy households in the 
upper part of the distribution and are one of the most un -
evenly distributed types of asset (see also Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2022a), p. 26). Individual extremely high values can 
therefore have a major impact on measured averages and 
inequality, not only for this asset type but also for net 
wealth as a whole.
33 There was a sharp rise in insolvencies in Germany, espe -
cially in 2021 (see Insolvenzen nach Jahren – Federal 
Statistical Office (destatis.de) ). In this wave of the survey in 
particular, the PHF data show fewer households reporting 
that the enterprises they own would hypothetically sell for 
€0. These are freelancers and self- employed persons with 
no further employees.Deutsche Bundesbank

In 2017, 43% of households reported regularly 
saving a fixed amount. By 2021, this share had 
increased slightly to 46%. The share of house -
holds reporting that they cannot save because 
they lack the financial resources to do so has 
declined, which is consistent with inflows to 
liquid savings and the somewhat lower level of 
debt in the less wealthy part of the distribution.
Overall, the share of households reporting that 
they were unable to save fell from 15% in 2017 
to 11%. In 2014, the share was almost twice as 
high at 20%. The decline among the less 
wealthy 20% of the wealth distribution is par -
ticularly marked. While in 2014 48% and in 
2017 41% of households in this part of the dis -
tribution had reported that they were unable to 
save, in 2021 the figure was only 33%. Whether 
this is an effect of the pandemic or a more sus -
tained development remains to be seen.
There were only minor shifts in the most im -
portant motives for saving, with “retirement 
provision” and “safety net for emergencies” 
continuing to dominate (see the chart on 
p. 42). Both reasons were cited more often as 
the most important motive in 2021 than in 
2017. Around 32% of households cited creat -
ing a safety net for emergencies, as many as in 
2014. In 2017, the corresponding share was 
29%. This development consequently does not 
indicate that households see an increased need 
to create a safety net for emergencies in re -
sponse to their experiences during the corona -
virus pandemic in 2020 and 2021. As shown in 
the box on pp. 35f., many households did, in 
fact, get through the pandemic without major 
financial problems in 2020 and 2021.
A decline in the share of households saving to 
purchase residential property would be consist -
ent with the hypothesis that certain house -
holds have abandoned their plans to purchase 
property. However, the decline is very small, at 
-1.5 percentage points. The increased share of 
households saving for larger purchases, which 
could point to catching- up effects after the 
pandemic, should also not be overinterpreted.It is not yet possible to gauge whether and 
how quickly households will reduce the add -
itional savings balances they built up during the 
pandemic.34 However, this is an important 
question for forthcoming surveys and could in -
fluence the development of the wealth distri -
bution.
Households’ debt situation
Looking at the debt situation of households is 
just as relevant for central banks as analysing 
asset holdings. Household debt plays a role in 
assessing financial stability, in particular. In add -
ition, the debt situation also has an impact on More house -

monetary policy transmission,35 for example, if 
indebted households severely restrict their con -
sumption as a result of rising interest rates or 
financial restrictions.
Several indicators can be used to describe the 
debt situation, including the percentage of 
households in debt, the amount of outstanding 
debt and households’ debt sustainability.
Between 2017 and 2021, the percentage of in -
debted households36 fell by around 4 percent -
age points to 41%. This is due to a decrease in 
both the share of households with secured 
mortgage loans (-3 percentage points) and the 
share of households with unsecured loans 
(-4 percentage points). Thus, the basic struc -
ture of fewer households having secured loans 
(18%) than unsecured loans (29%) has not 
changed. The median outstanding amount for 
mortgage loans of €84,500 is still significantly 
higher than the outstanding amounts for other loans (median: €5,500). Both figures have risen 
only marginally since 2017.
Both the share of households with any kind of 
debt and the size of the amount these house -
holds owe increase with gross household in -
come. Of the households in the lower fifth of 
the income distribution, around 29% have out -
standing debt (median: €2,000). By contrast, 
55% of households in the upper tenth of the 
income distribution have outstanding debt 
(median €82,900).
The composition of loans also changes along 
the income distribution. Households with 
higher incomes hold mortgage loans much 
more frequently than other households, while 
households with low incomes mainly have out -
standing unsecured loans.
The differences between households with out -
standing debt are less pronounced along the 
net wealth distribution. However, it is particu -
larly common for households with less wealth 
to be indebted (54%). As wealth increases, the 
share of households with mortgage loans in 
particular grows, which in total leads to a share 
of households with outstanding loans of 
around 40% among the 10% wealthiest house -
holds.
These structures suggest that households with 
large outstanding loans generally also have suf -
ficient current financial resources to make inter -
est and principal payments. In addition, the 
large loan amounts often appear to be matched 
by corresponding assets, which can serve as 
collateral for the lender in the event of a loan 
default.
Since 2010-11, the share of payments of inter -
est and principal in net household income has 
averaged between 19% and 23% for house -Share of

holds with credit liabilities. In 2021, this share 
was 17%. As the chart above shows, the per -
centile cut-  off values have largely fallen. This 
suggests that the financial burden of servicing 
debt has come down for the bulk of indebted 
households, although just over 15% of all in -
debted households still have to spend more 
than 30% of their household income on inter -
est payments and the repayment of loans. Such 
households with a relatively high level of debt 
service are found along the entire net income 
distribution and not only among lower- income 
households.
The fact that nominal wages increased further 
between 2017 and 2021 despite slumping in 
2020 is likely to have been a factor in the de -
cline in debt service as a share of net income, 
alongside less pronounced growth in outstand -
ing loan amounts.37 Lending rates for new 
loans were relatively stable and should there -
fore have contributed little to these develop -
ments. It was not until September 2022 that 
key interest rates rose in several steps and inter -
est rates on savings deposits and loans also in -
creased. How this impacts debt sustainability 
remains to be seen and can only be examined 
in the next wave of the PHF. This wave will be 
conducted in 2023 and its results are to be 
published in early 2025.Conclusion and outlook
Overall, there appear to be no far- reaching 
changes in the structure of household wealth 
in Germany in 2021. Asset holdings have risen 
significantly across the board since 2017. 
Wealth inequality fell slightly as measured by 
indicators of relative inequality, in part as a re -
sult of the additional savings accumulated dur -
ing the pandemic. It remains to be seen how 
sustainable this development is.
The PHF study, which has been conducted for 
ten years now, also makes it possible to take a 
closer look at longer- term dynamics. This does 
not reveal any fundamental changes in house -
hold investment behaviour, and inequality 
measures fell only slightly over the long term, 
too. This testifies to the fact that the wealth 
distribution and the underlying portfolio struc -
tures in Germany are changing only slowly. 
Shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic also 
do not appear to have induced fundamental 
changes in the short term. However, an analy -
sis of longer- term (behavioural) adjustments is 
still pending.Debt service as

In terms of the debt situation, households in 
Germany seem to have entered the phase of 
rising interest rates that began in 2022 from a 
good position in a longer- term comparison.
The PHF survey presented here ended in 2021. 
Since that time, there have been some devel -
opments relevant to household wealth and 
debt, such as the rising interest rates. The im -
pact of these changes on household saving, in -
vestment and debt behaviour is to be captured 
by the next wave of the survey in 2023, the re -
sults of which are scheduled for publication at 
the beginning of 2025. It will then potentially 
also be possible to analyse whether the corona -
virus pandemic had a medium to longer- term 
impact on households’ finances.
Finally, it should be noted that this article is 
confined to describing the composition and 
distribution of household wealth and debt in 
Germany. Other factors such as disposable in -
come, public finances, the social security sys -
tem and access to education, to name but a 
few, also play a role when it comes to forming 
a more comprehensive assessment of the finan -
cial situation or indeed the welfare of house -
holds.Table appendix
Only a small selection of the indicators for Ger -
man household finances could be presented in 
this article on the PHF survey findings. The fol -
lowing appendix contains further tables. Each 
table shows the percentage of households 
who own a particular asset or are in debt 
(prevalence), the conditional mean and the 
conditional median. “Conditional” in this con -
text means that the means and medians are all 
computed only for those households who pos -
sess a given asset or have a particular type of 
debt. Where no prevalence is stated, it is 100% 
and the means and medians refer to all house -
holds. These three statistics are shown in total 
as well as broken down by the age, nationality, 
labour market status, school and professional 
education of the reference person,38 the type 
of household, the region in which a household 
lives and its homeowner status. In addition, the 
households are also differentiated according to 
their position in the distributions of net wealth 
and gross income.
38 In this context, the reference person is always the per -
son with the highest income in the household. If two or 
more members of a household have an equally high in -
come, one person is selected at random.Deutsche Bundesbank

* Gross income is the sum of the income components included in the survey. By contrast, net income is the respondent’s self-assessment 
of the total. When respondents are asked to give net income as an aggregate, aggregation bias may arise; this means that incomes are 
understated as certain income components are more likely to be forgotten than when they are specifi  cally asked about. 1 Mecklenburg-

Turning point in payments
Global payments is an area which has seen considerable growth in recent decades and is pursu -
ing a trend towards ever greater integration. Along the way, efficiency has been enhanced and 
risks reduced. But developments that could significantly change the global payments landscape 
have been under way for some years now. These include the emergence of new forms of money, 
the advent of new technologies, the entry of new competitors into the market and a heightening 
of cyber risks. While these developments are capable, on the one hand, of spurring innovation 
and new additions to the existing market offering, they also have a flip side in that they make the 
payments landscape more complex and generate frictions and fragmentation.
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the sanctions associated with it have now brought 
a geopolitical dynamic into play, too. Some sanctions are having a significant impact on pay -
ments. The ban on the use of specialised messaging services (such as SWIFT) imposed on selected 
banks is directly interfering with payments to and from Russia as well as payment traffic within 
the country itself. Its main aim is particularly to cut affected financial market participants off from 
international payments. In addition, some participants are subject to full asset freezes, restricting 
disposals and prohibiting others from making funds and economic resources available to them.
All the same, moves to evade the restrictions have taken hold, including the use of alternative 
messaging services outside the reach of the sanctions. On top of this, countries that are not par -
ticipating in the sanctions are drawing payment and trade flows their way, which is further soft -
ening the impact of the sanctions. Overall, it appears that while the sanctions have led to a 
decline in Russia’s cross- border payments, the latter have remained largely intact. A substantial 
portion of the decline in traffic is therefore likely attributable to the indirect effects of the meas -
ures imposed on trade in goods, services and financial products.
Taken together, the various factors driving developments, combined with the direct and indirect 
repercussions of the sanctions as reflected in the ongoing policy debates, could mark the start of 
a turning point in payments in three respects. First, new forms of money, technology and com -
petitors as well as cyber risks have the capacity to fundamentally transform both national and 
cross- border payments. Second, the geopolitical situation is likely to lead to fragmentation in 
cross- border payments. Third, national interests look set to play a greater role when it comes to 
payments. Regardless of that, policymakers should keep endeavouring to ensure that new tech -
nologies in the payments space do not lead to structural fragmentation. In addition, they should 
continue to do their bit in dismantling barriers hampering the settlement of cross- border pay -
ments and, for example, redouble efforts to establish globally harmonised standards and inter -
operable interfaces going forward. Lastly, regulators need to carry on working together and liaise 
even more closely, especially with regard to future innovative developments. Irrespective of the 
individual states’ desire for sovereignty in payments, all states should have an interest in prevent -
ing risk- enhancing regulatory arbitrage.Deutsche Bundesbank

Integration and dynamics in 
payments
Payments is a field of increasing significance 
and an area that has been following a trend to -
wards ever greater integration for decades. 
Along the way, efficiency has been enhanced 
and risks reduced. Another sign of that evolu -
tion is the more prominent role being played by 
international service providers, payment service 
providers and internet platforms. In the early 
1990s, the fall of the Iron Curtain ushered in a 
new wave of globalisation, leading to a signifi -
cant increase in cross- border investment, migra -
tion, tourism and global trade in goods and 
services. This also brought with it a greater need 
for international payment solutions.
That said, the global payments landscape is still 
highly multi- faceted, being made up of various 
national payment systems which have de -
veloped over the course of time and exhibit 
their own technical, economic and legal idio -
syncrasies. Cross- border payments going from 
one system to another are usually settled via bi -
lateral relationships between correspondent 
banks or through money transfer services (such 
as Western Union and MoneyGram). This still 
makes for a considerable degree of friction.1 
Those frictions are being steadily –  albeit 
slowly – reduced, however: the harmonisation 
of messaging standards (e.g. ISO 20022), 
higher- performance national systems, the use 
of shared communication networks (e.g. the 
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Tele -
communication2 (SWIFT)) and, in some cases, 
also of collectively used systems some of which 
even boast multi- currency capability (e.g. Con -
tinuous Linked Settlement (CLS)) are all smooth -
ing the way for payments.
Impetus and support for these developments is 
also coming from policymaking quarters. The 
creation of CLS in 2002, for example, was the 
banking industry’s response to the G10 mem -
ber countries’ strategy for reducing risks in the 
settlement of foreign exchange transactions, in 
particular “Herstatt risk”.3 The falling costs of credit transfers made by migrants to family 
members back in their home countries (remit -
tances) are testament to steady advances in 
terms of efficiency and security in international 
payments.4 Even so, the potential for improve -
ment has yet to be fully tapped in the global 
payments landscape.5 This is why the G20 
Roadmap for Enhancing Cross- border Pay -
ments, endorsed in 2020, establishes targets 
with a view to harmonising regulatory require -
ments and increasing data quality where cross- 
border payments are concerned. There are also 
plans to expand existing payment infrastruc -
tures and develop new ones.6
However, radical external impulses have been 
at work on the payments space in recent years. 
These factors have been driving the debate 
about the road ahead for both national and 
cross- border payments. They are a source of 
uncertainty because the structure of the mar -
ket may undergo fundamental change, mean -
ing that it is no longer possible to extrapolate 
on the basis of how things have developed so 
far. On top of that, new risks may emerge 
which existing risk management approaches 
might not be able to fully hem in. If the existing 
success factors and value chain elements of a 
product get replaced by different factors and 
elements, disruptive effects can ensue. At the 
same time, there is a risk that these sorts of im -
pulses will provoke substantial fragmentation Cashless pay -

in 1974. The term “Herstatt risk” describes what happens 
when the two payment legs making up a foreign exchange 
transaction are decoupled on account of time zone differ -
ences: parties are exposed to delivery or settlement risk 
stemming from the danger that one of them could go 
bankrupt in the time gap between both transactions being 
settled. According to a survey conducted by the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS), however, around one- third 
of all foreign exchange transactions still involve settlement 
risk. See Bank for International Settlements (2022).

Functioning of international payments
A number of payment instruments, such 
as  cash, payment cards, credit transfers, 
e-money and crypto tokens, can be used 
for cross- border payments. Which instru-
ment is selected depends on the payment 
service providers available, the currency 
area in question and user preferences.
The cross- border payment process can be 
broken down into several phases. The do-
mestic leg of a payment fl  ow is usually 
based on national payment systems. The 
cross- border leg can be carried out via cor-
respondent banks, platforms belonging 
to specialised international providers (e.g. 
PayPal or Wise) or interlinked national sys-
tems. The idea of making cross- border pay-
ments via peer- to- peer systems (e.g. public 
blockchain infrastructures) – even without 
involving a payment service provider in 
some cases  – emerged around ten years 
ago and is therefore still relatively new.
Payments from one currency area to an-
other are mostly settled via correspondent 
banks. Processing is based on accounts that 
domestic institutions hold with foreign cor-
respondent banks in order to settle pay-
ments in foreign currency. Payment orders 
must be submitted before settlement can 
take place. From a technical perspective, 
different communication networks can be 
used for this purpose, including telephone, 
fax or email. For reasons of effi   ciency, spe-
cialised messaging services, such as SWIFT 
(Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 
Telecommunication), are used in most 
cases. The cooperative SWIFT, which was 
established in 1973, has around 11,000 par-
ticipants in more than 200 countries. In 
2022, it processed an average of around 20 
million payment messages per day.1 Since 
SWIFT is domiciled in Belgium, it is subject to Belgian law and therefore also to EU 
regulations. Given its important role in the 
fi  nancial system and the potential adverse 
impact of a breakdown in global communi-
cation channels between fi  nancial market 
participants, SWIFT is jointly overseen by 
the G10 central banks and the ECB. Many 
national or regional payment providers also 
use SWIFT as their communication channel.
In economically highly integrated regions, 
the idea of using cross- border platforms is 
also being considered. In the euro area, for 
example, euro payments can already be 
processed across borders using TARGET ser-
vices. Work is underway to expand TARGET 
services to become a multi- currency system. 
Such multi- currency platforms are already in 
operation in South Africa (SADC- RTGS) and 
in the Arab region (Buna).2

in the existing payments landscape.7 Such ex -
ternal impulses include, for example, new 
forms of money, new technologies, new com -
petitors and increased cyber risks.
One example of a new form of money might 
be crypto tokens.8 These are digital units of 
value created by private providers that can be 
transferred directly between participants over 
virtual networks. However, their value is usually 
so unstable that they are ill- suited for use in 
payment transactions or as a store of value. Ra -
ther, they are used predominantly as a specula -
tive instrument and form part of an increasingly 
complex system of decentralised financial ser -
vices.9 Stablecoins take crypto tokens one step 
further; their value is mostly kept stable by 
pegs to government currencies and asset back -
ing.10 However, recent developments have 
shown that, without a comprehensive regula -
tory set- up which efficiently curbs the risks to 
both holders and the ecosystem as a whole, 
stablecoins’ prospects for success are likely to 
be limited.
Payment service providers are faced with mul -
tiple challenges all at once. These alternative 
forms of money are paving the way for new 
business cases, and customers open to innov -
ation are keen to make use of those. Yet there 
is a high degree of risk involved, the margin has 
to be shared with the new providers, and regu -
lation is still in its infancy.11 Furthermore, there 
is the chance that such tokens could crowd out 
the commercial bank money that has hitherto 
dominated payments. Only a few institutions 
are likely to be able to create their own token 
and bring it to market with a realistic chance of 
success.12 The alternative – implementing some 
kind of digital (tokenised) commercial bank 
money that would be shared by institutions – 
does not seem easily feasible in the short or 
medium term.13
Another innovative form of money is central 
bank digital currency (CBDC), which is being 
pursued, at least as a concept, in virtually all 
major advanced and emerging economies.14 The introduction of CBDC may have far-  
reaching ramifications. The implications of 
introducing a retail CBDC, available for all to 
use, are likely to be more wide-  ranging than 
those associated with the wholesale CBDC vari -
ant for use only by a limited set of financial in -
stitutions. European sovereignty in payments is 
one argument for introducing the digital euro, 
the Eurosystem’s potential retail CBDC. Certain 
changes to the market structure as it stands are 
a natural consequence of this and certainly in -
tentional on the policymaking side, but without 
a wish to challenge the delicately balanced role 
distribution between sovereign and private ser -
vices in the world of payments. CBDC systems 
could be a boon for cross- border payments if 
different countries design their solutions to be 
interoperable.15
The need for tokenised money is born of innov -
ations in the field of IT infrastructures.16 As a 
driver of innovation in payments – not just in 
the domestic arena but in international pay -
ments, too  – distributed ledger technology 
(DLT) promises two decisive benefits. First, it 
allows transactions to be settled by independ -
ent partners on a shared database. That effect -
ively does away with reconciliation processes. 
Second, it facilitates the automated settlement 
of transactions by means of smart contracts.17

10 Alongside pegs to government currencies (for the most 
part US dollars) and backing with corresponding reserve 
assets, some stablecoins seek to limit volatility by being 
backed with crypto tokens or by relying on algorithmic sta -
bilisation methods; these have yet to garner broad trust in 
the market.

17 Smart contracts are software scripts that automatically 
execute closed contracts depending on the occurrence of 
predefined events. They make it possible to simplify fulfil -
ment of complex, recurring contract processes between 
several partners. As such, they are regarded as a key tech -
nology for reducing transaction costs in an economic sys -
tem based on the division of labour. See Deutsche Bundes -

multitude of manual interventions, can thus be 
handled automatically, potentially saving time 
and transaction costs. At the same time, the 
technology carries potential for reducing risks. 
Ideally, there should be as much flexibility and 
automation in the flow of money as there is in 
flows of goods and services as well as informa -
tion.18
Financial institutions are seeking solutions to 
support the opportunities that DLT has to offer 
when it comes to money. But uncertainty 
abounds: the world has yet to see a single 
major financial market infrastructure operating 
on the basis of DLT. It would call for adjust -
ments that would need to be implemented 
throughout the industry and on a global basis; 
they are complex and come with a hefty price 
tag in terms of development costs. The existing 
global networks are private, proprietary solu -
tions that are often difficult to regulate owing 
to a lack of clear governance. Numerous cen -
tral banks are currently working on DLT pilots 
with a view, for instance, to simplifying the 
process chains involved in the complex busi -
ness of securities settlement or in international 
payments, especially banks’ multi- currency 
liquidity management.
In addition to new forms of money and new 
technology, new competitors are also joining 
the mix, in the form of bigtech and fintech 
companies. Fintech firms are often swifter and 
more agile than established financial service 
providers and are unencumbered by existing 
business operations and legacy systems. They 
optimise sub- processes along the value chain 
and also want to participate as economic play -
ers in the payments business. Bigtech firms are 
amassing considerable market power, allowing 
them to amortise fixed costs for development 
much faster than incumbent financial service 
providers. Moreover, by leveraging their global 
user base they can roll out many of their offer -
ings in parallel in different markets, even 
though national specificities generally call for a 
degree of differentiation. The payments busi -
ness is thus advancing to become a highly competitive field, in which radical structural 
changes of the like not seen in decades seem 
possible.
Cyber risks are also making waves, representing 
a threat the dimension of which –  both in 
terms of nature and scope – warrants particu -
lar forethought and defensive measures. Cyber -
attacks targeting payments could also be used 
as a political weapon, for example. All stake -
holders in the payments space must therefore 
stand ready to face potential aggressors who 
are state- organised or state- sponsored,19 have 
undergone professional training and have sub -
stantial resources at their disposal. Adequate 
safeguards against cyberattacks should no 
longer be a mere add- on to existing systems. 
Instead, there needs to be systematic planning 
and ongoing monitoring of cyber resilience 
across all product areas and processes, includ -
ing those of suppliers.20 When it comes to pay -
ments, where the greatest risk lies in the dis -
ruption to operational processes, this should 
see cyber resilience being accorded top priority, 
even ranking ahead of new product develop -
ment.
Overall, payments are going through a period 
of structural adjustment. This applies in particu -
lar to international payments. While payments 
have experienced convergence around the 
globe in recent years, with a greater willingness 
to cooperate at the international level, strong 
external impulses could trigger structural 
changes that will not necessarily follow the 
same trajectory.

against Ukraine. E xtensive sanctions against the 
aggressor have been enacted by the West with 
backing from many other countries. Some of 
these sanctions are having a significant impact 
on payments. Their direct and indirect reper -
cussions could cause upheaval in efforts to in -
tegrate the global payments landscape, which 
can be held up as a mirror to developments in 
the geopolitical space. An increase in bilateral 
and multilateral political and economic cooper -
ation from the mid- 20th century deepened 
international cooperation in the world of pay -
ments as well. The responses to Russia’s war of 
aggression against Ukraine and the sanctions 
imposed in payments mark an important turn -
ing point and could severely hamper this devel -
opment.
Involving central infrastructures and messaging 
service providers such as SWIFT as a sanction 
instrument is not a new concept per se. Even 
though SWIFT did not actively participate in 
policy responses in the past, citing its neutral 
position,21,22 in 2012, its own network’s inter -
national data traffic with selected Iranian banks 
was blocked for the first time to implement 
corresponding sanctions under Belgian and 
European law.23,24
The payment sanctions adopted since February 
2022 in response to Russia’s war of aggression 
against Ukraine introduce a new dimension, 
however. The G7 countries and the European 
Union agreed on a series of measures compris -
ing not just diplomatic and economic sanctions 
but also restrictions in payments and financial 
markets. The aim of these measures is to sig -
nificantly increase the economic costs of the 
war for Russia to “effectively thwart Russian 
abilities to continue the aggression”.25 The ban 
preventing certain Russian and Belarusian 
banks from using specialised messaging ser -
vices for payment transactions was met with a 
very large public response.26 This ban intended 
to cut off important financial market partici -
pants in an industrial country or emerging mar -
ket economy from international payments for 
the first time. As at 31  December 2022, ten Russian banks were prohibited from using 
these messaging services.
Selected sanctions imposed on 
Russia since the outbreak of 
the war
The predominant status enjoyed by one par -
ticular provider in the messaging services mar -
ket means that people often talk about “SWIFT 
sanctions” when in fact, by law, the sanctions 
affect all messaging service providers in the 
payments space. Political and public circles 
have placed high hopes in disconnecting Rus -
sian banks because at the time the sanctions 
were imposed, the communication side of al -
most all international transactions involving 
Russia was routed via SWIFT. Thus, the impact 
of these sanctions would not initially depend 
on implementation by other countries. Further -
more, SWIFT had been heavily used to settle 
interbank payments within Russia.
Given that, in such cases, only the transmission 
or receipt of transaction details using a special -
ised messaging service provider is made impos -
sible for sanctioned banks, these measures can 
be evaded27 at relatively low cost. For example, 
transaction details can be transmitted via alter -
native communication channels (e.g. by tele -
phone, fax or email) or by means of non-  
sanctioned domestic (correspondent) banks 
that are still linked up to SWIFT.

plementing the sanctions imposed. The Russian 
central bank has been threatened with expul -
sion from SWIFT once before – following Rus -
sia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 – when it 
responded by developing a national messaging 
service provider of its own, Sistema Peredachi 
Finansovykh Soobscheniy (SPFS).28 Plus, there 
are other third countries that operate their own 
messaging systems,29 which are partly multi-  
currency compatible and are used as an alter -
native to SWIFT.30 Although the use of such 
systems by EU banks would not formally consti -
tute an infringement of the law, it would run 
counter to the objectives of the sanctions.
Measures that not only prohibit the use of spe -
cialised messaging service providers but also 
impose a broad transaction ban on the respect -
ive banks have a much more severe impact. In 
practice, this means that restrictions on dispos -
itions and prohibitions on making funds and 
economic resources available are imposed on 
sanctioned banks. That is to say that these banks’ assets in the sanctioning countries are 
frozen and that there is a blanket ban on pro -
viding them with funds directly or indirectly – 
i.e. to make payment transactions in favour of 
these banks. These sanctions will only be ef -
fective in those countries where the sanctions 
apply, while SWIFT sanctions will apply to all 
countries as they are implemented directly by 
SWIFT.

Sanctions on the use of messa -
ging services in payments
On balance, SPFS –  Russia’s counterpart to 
SWIFT – has presumably seen significant and 
growing use for a large proportion of payment 
transaction messages within Russia since spring 
2022. For cross- border payments, however, it is 
more difficult to switch to alternatives to in -
cumbent providers. Network effects play a key 
role here, as international partners would also 
need to be willing to link up to the alternative 
messaging system and have to make a con -
scious decision not to comply with the sanc -
tions.
Russia’s domestic and international payments 
still appear to be largely intact overall. Even so, 
there has evidently been a decline in Russia’s 
cross- border payments as a result of the sanc -
tions.31 It is impossible to attribute that decline 
solely to the sanctions on payments, though, 
especially since the effectiveness of sanctions in 
this area depends in part on the number of 
sanctioned banks. Much of the decline, then, 
can be put down to the indirect effects that the 
measures are having on trade in goods, ser -
vices and financial products. Moreover, evasive 
action has become commonplace, with signs 
emerging in recent months that not just the 
traded goods but also the payment flows with 
Russia for those goods are apparently being re -
routed via third countries that are not actively 
involved in sanctions against Russia. As a result, 
evasive transaction flows are still getting 
through despite the sanctions, and the pay -
ment sanctions are losing more and more of 
their bite as time progresses.32
If goods traffic or financial transactions are to 
continue to be executed with parties sanc -
tioned by other countries, stakeholders will 
presumably switch to using alternative pay -
ment channels and systems. This can be done, 
for example, by making greater use of payment 
systems in the importer’s or exporter’s country 
or by linking together national payment sys -
tems.33 The avenues being explored also in -clude, for instance, work conducted by the 
Russian central bank on CBDC.34
Implications for policy and 
payments
External impulses and geopolitical develop -
ments, as well as the responses they provoke, 
can be a catalyst for far- reaching change in 
international payments. For instance, new DLT- 
based settlement infrastructures, coupled with 
innovative digital forms of money, could rapidly 
change the face of both domestic and cross-  
border payments. At the same time, geopolit -
ical tensions could lead to a shift of emphasis in 
cross- border payments in particular, which, in 
keeping with the general political debate, could 
be described for illustrative purposes as a turn -
ing point in payments. A tendency to fragment 
and a greater focus on national interests in 
payments are plausible consequences. Given 
the crucial importance of payments for a na -
tional economy, this is likely to concern all 
countries –  albeit to varying degrees  – irre -
spective of whether, in the current war, they 
are the sanctioned aggressor, part of the com -
munity imposing sanctions, parties backing or 
sympathising with one side, or merely bystand -
ers.
Hence, Russia, too, is responding to the sanc -
tions with efforts to expand its national pay -
ment system and intensify its bilateral and 
regional  contacts. It is also looking to open 
up additional transaction channels by embra -
cing digital money and new technologies. The Message trans -

34 Since 2020, the Bank of Russia has been exploring the 
possibility of introducing a retail CBDC (see Bank of Russia 
(2021b)). Work on the “digital rouble” has been stepped up 
as a result of the sanctions imposed. A pilot project was 
launched on 1  April 2023 and a nationwide roll- out is 
scheduled for 2024. A digital rouble would reportedly 
make payments in Russia faster, simpler and safer, reduce 
transaction costs, improve financial inclusion and 
strengthen the competitiveness of the Russian currency. 
There are also plans to explore cross- border functionalities, 
such as bilateral links to foreign CBDCs.Deutsche Bundesbank

example  of Russia could serve as a blueprint for 
many countries striving for greater independ -
ence and sovereignty.
In general, countries could take the precaution -
ary measure of setting up alternatives in pay -
ments to give themselves more options to set -
tle the financial leg of trades and financial 
transactions. Even if they did so, international 
standards could continue to be applied in pro -
prietary national systems, too. A switch to or 
the complementary use of other currencies in 
foreign trade, or even of other forms of money, 
as well as the use of alternative payment ser -
vice providers and messaging services are vi -
able options. New technologies such as DLT 
open up transaction channels that are inde -
pendent of existing ones. In theory, new pro -
viders such as fintech and bigtech firms are also 
creating additional transaction channels for 
payments with their platforms. However, these 
will probably only ever be an alternative if they 
are located in what the country in question 
considers to be politically acceptable jurisdic -
tions.
These developments could also end up chan -
ging the currencies used for invoicing in inter -
national payments. At present, US dollar and 
euro are very heavily used as payment curren -
cies in cross- border transactions, which is why 
settlement normally also takes place through 
the corresponding infrastructures in the United 
States and the euro area. Hence, cross- currency 
transactions between participants in the Euro -
pean Economic Area (EEA) and non- EEA partici -
pants accounted for almost 40% of all pay -
ments in TARGET2 in 2021.35 As alternative 
payment channels open up, this could usher in 
a situation where, at the global aggregate 
level, greater use is made of other countries’ 
currencies and payments worldwide become 
increasingly fragmented.36
That kind of fragmentation in international 
payments would be expected to add to trans -
action costs and settlement times.37 The eco -
nomic upside offered by economies of scale and network effects would be left untapped 
for the most part if, for example, other pro -
viders were used to a greater extent alongside 
SWIFT in international payments in future. In 
addition, challenges could arise for global 
liquidity management, with corresponding 
costs going forward. Overall, fragmentation 
could make payments more expensive for the 
economy, and, owing to the added operational 
complexity, riskier as well. That may well blunt 
the impact of sanctions in the financial sector.
In light of these tendencies, it is important to 
ensure that geopolitical tensions do not ad -
versely affect the efforts initiated in 2020 by 
the G20 to improve efficiency in international 
payments. This is particularly true of the debate 
surrounding future settlement infrastructures in 
cross- border payments. Various models are 
under discussion, including payment systems 
developed and operated jointly by several dif -
ferent countries. Recent developments have 
shown that these present two key challenges in 
the event of a geopolitical conflict. First, coun -
tries could experience disadvantages due to 
sanctioning or being excluded by the majority 
of other countries. Those seeing themselves in 
what might be a minority position would no 
longer entrust their payments to that kind of 
system dominated by other countries. Second, 
the system could be sabotaged by cyberat -
tacks. The more a potential attacker knows 
about how a system is structured and what 
protective measures are in place, the more le -
thal such attacks will be. Governance arrange -
ments alone are unlikely to be able to alleviate 
any mistrust this might cause. Rather, there 
needs to be an innate sense of trust, which 
presupposes an overlapping consensus of polit -
ical values.
This backdrop makes it all the more important 
to ensure that globally harmonised standards 
and interoperable interfaces are in place. For Impact possible

instance, national or international systems can 
be operated separately but remain technically 
connected by efficient bridge solutions, thus 
ensuring that liquidity flows as smoothly as 
possible. Most countries will probably have lit -
tle interest, as hitherto, in cutting off their own 
payments and will probably continue looking 
for ways to settle cross- border payments as ef -
ficiently as possible. After all, this is likely to re -
main an important prerequisite for participat -
ing in world trade.
The objective of achieving national sovereignty 
in economic, infrastructural and security policy 
matters is now increasingly extending into the 
realm of payments. In this context, sovereignty 
refers to a sufficiently strong degree of self-  
determination or the ability to act independ -
ently. Payment transactions may constitute part 
of the strategic autonomy of a nation state or 
currency area.38 On the whole, the notion of 
sovereignty and an acknowledgement of pay -
ment transactions as a critical infrastructure is 
becoming ever more evident in political com -
munication. Over the past few years, observers 
have noted an increase in protectionist policy 
approaches as well as sanctions and exclusions 
from payment systems, resulting in risks to the 
availability of payment settlement services (par -
ticularly in countries that are highly dependent 
on a small number of and/ or dominant system 
providers).39 For example, Russia has been less -
ening its strong reliance on the international 
card companies Mastercard and Visa since 
2014 by shifting its entire payment processing 
operations to Russia, and, at the same time, es -
tablishing its own national debit card system 
(Mir).
The objective of sovereignty in payments is be -
coming increasingly important as digitalisation 
accelerates.40 Digital processes in payments are 
characterised by strong economies of scale and 
network effects, which can quickly work in fa -
vour of global payment service providers and 
platform operators. The outcome of this could 
be dominant market positions, limited com -
petitive intensity as well as lock- in effects due to close ties to the platforms or products on 
offer. That is why national sovereignty also ex -
tends to the independence of private sector 
providers. If digital money is also tokenised and 
can be used in integrated digital processes such 
as DLT, any disruption (e.g. sabotage or sanc -
tions) in the settlement of the cash leg could 
simultaneously directly impair real economic 
processes.
This has spurred the EU, for example, to imple -
ment various legislative initiatives aimed at 
making Europe less dependent on non-  
European technologies and technology com -
panies.41 The European Commission’s 2030 
Digital Compass initiative also calls for the pro -
tection of digital sovereignty and for the EU to 
lead the way in value chains identified as stra -
tegically important.42
The Eurosystem’s responsibility to ensure stable 
and efficient payment transactions in the euro 
area is based on its statutory mandate43 and 
makes an important contribution to the stabil -
ity and integrity of the financial and economic 
system. However, discharging this mandate 
means that the ultimate regulatory sovereignty 
over payments in the euro area has to remain 
with the competent bodies of the EU, and that 
the enforceability of these regulations is guar -
anteed. In the event of a crisis or an attempt to 
influence operations (e.g. sanctions, sabotage, 
cyberattacks), being dependent on a third party 
could compromise the settlement of payments. 
In the interests of European payments, it is im -
portant to reduce such dependence on non-  International

European infrastructure providers. In principle, 
the Eurosystem needs to define which func -
tions in payment and settlement systems must 
be fulfilled in a sovereign manner.
Yet sovereignty does not necessarily refer only 
to provision by the public sector. That said, a 
European payment infrastructure solution oper -
ated by the private sector would require the 
willingness of the European banking sector to 
cooperate, as well as high initial investment 
and the use of uniform standards. Efforts to 
date (such as the European Payments Initiative 
(EPI)) have not yet been able to achieve 
product- ready results, but would be a good 
starting point for a European platform of this 
kind. In the public sector space, meanwhile, 
the introduction of a digital euro could lay the 
groundwork for European payment solutions. 
This would require a digital euro to be issued 
on a dedicated and independently controllable 
infrastructure. Uniform technical standards 
would enable the market to build pan- European 
payment solutions on this infrastructure that 
could have a long- term future as an alternative 
to non- European CBDCs, stablecoins or other 
crypto tokens.
On the one hand, CBDC is seen as a way to en -
sure accessibility for broad segments of the 
population at the international level, too, 
through simple, inclusive access based on com -
pletely new infrastructures. On the other hand, 
concerns have also been raised in some quar -
ters about possible macroeconomic conse -quences, including the possibility of currency 
substitution in other economies.44 This may be 
the case if, first and foremost, countries were 
specifically to pursue hegemonial strategies. 
This backdrop suggests that it would be of ut -
most importance for the CBDC projects of the 
various countries to be closely coordinated, for 
mutually agreed principles to be observed and 
for interoperability solutions to allow for cross- 
border use without undermining the sover -
eignty of individual countries. However, the 
current geopolitical situation is not making 
these challenges any smaller.
Payment regulators especially must be pre -
pared to face possible fragmentation and other 
changes. New technologies, new forms of 
money and new providers, irrespective of 
whether they operate nationally or internation -
ally, must be regulated in as technology- neutral 
a manner as possible and with a focus on risks. 
Moreover, these developments call for more in -
tensive interaction between regulators, given 
how they could potentially work across na -
tional borders. Regardless of any desire on the 
part of individual countries for sovereignty in 
payments, all states should have an interest in 
preventing risk- enhancing regulatory arbitrage. 
However, the current geopolitical situation 
makes it more difficult for the necessary tech -
nical interaction between the regulatory au -
thorities to take place.Private and pub -

Sustainability risks in banking supervision
Climate change and the transition to a low- emission economy are posing major challenges for 
banks. Whilst extreme weather events such as the 2021 floods in the Ahrtal region of Germany 
can have a direct impact on the real estate affected and thus on banks’ loan collateral, the con -
sequences of a gradual increase in average temperatures are transmitted to banks and their risks 
over a significantly longer time horizon. The transmission channels are multi- layered and com -
plex. Added to this are policy measures to mitigate climate change, which may affect banks’ cor -
porate customers, in particular, via factors such as higher costs for greenhouse gas emissions. 
That said, climate action measures are just a subset of the European Union’s (EU) measures to 
achieve the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. In addition to climate objectives, 
they also include other environmental objectives, social objectives and the promotion of good 
governance. The acronym “ESG” (environmental, social, governance) is used to summarise these 
sustainability categories.
The risks to banks stemming from ESG measures, or even from delays in their implementation, are 
relevant for risk- oriented banking supervision. ESG risks are not entirely new types of risk for bank -
ing supervisors. Rather, they can be understood as drivers of known risk categories such as credit 
or market risk. However, when it comes to capturing and – in the case of climate- related risks in 
particular – quantifying them, conventional methods quickly reach their limits. Regulatory require -
ments and established risk analysis methods are largely based on historical data. These are only 
of very limited use in predicting how ESG risks could manifest in the future and translate into 
financial risks.
This means that banks need to develop new approaches in order to adequately manage ESG risks 
and become more resilient to them. Supervisory authorities and standard setters have published 
guidance on this at the national, European and global level. Various studies show that most 
banks have so far fallen short of the supervisory expectations of the ECB and the Federal Finan -
cial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Supervisors will therefore focus on the progress made by banks 
in implementing the existing requirements over the next few years. Findings from ESG reporting 
and the Bundesbank’s climate risk stress test will support the ongoing work.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Climate change and the transition to a sustain -
able and, in particular, climate- neutral econ -
omy are both posing major challenges to the 
German banking system. This article considers 
sustainability risks – often referred to as ESG 
risks – from a supervisory and regulatory per -
spective. ESG stands for environmental, social 
and governance, with climate- related risks 
forming a separate sub- category of environ -
mental risks. ESG risks as understood in this art -
icle subsume both risks arising from “too little” 
sustainability – such as risks stemming from en -
vironmental degradation and climate change – 
and risks arising from a transition to greater 
sustainability, although this also entails eco -
nomic opportunities. Given their urgency, 
climate- related risks are the focus of current 
supervisory and regulatory work and debate, 
particularly at the global level, and are also the 
focal point of this article.
The article begins by outlining the possible 
transmission channels through which climate-  
related risks can affect banks. Next, it sets out 
the regulatory treatment of ESG risks, before 
turning to current supervisory practice at the 
national and European level and the challenges 
facing banks. The Bundesbank’s climate risk 
stress test is used to shed more light on pos -
sible approaches and challenges in analysing 
financial risks stemming from climate change.
Possible transmission chan -
nels: how ESG risks give rise 
to bank risks as illustrated by 
climate- related risks
For the supervisory treatment of climate- related 
risks, it helps to distinguish between “transition 
risks” and “physical risks”.
“Transition risks” are risks arising from the tran -
sition to a low- emission economy. These risks 
can be triggered, for example, by policy meas -
ures such as an increase in carbon taxation, by technological developments such as the expan -
sion of electric mobility or by changes in con -
sumer preferences. Because transition risks can 
alter the behaviour and planning of banks’ cus -
tomers and counterparties, they have an im -
pact on bank risks. For example, stricter climate- 
related rules, such as a scarcer supply of emis -
sions trading allowances, could lead to an in -
crease in a firm’s operating costs and render 
certain production methods and products un -
profitable in the medium or long term. If firms 
do not adapt, this could, among other things, 
impair their creditworthiness or reduce the re -
coverability of the loan collateral that these 
firms can provide to a bank; this would lead to 
an increase in the bank’s credit risk.1
Physical risks, on the other hand, comprise 
damage resulting from extreme weather events 
or the gradual change in climate. Extreme pre -
cipitation followed by flooding can damage in -
frastructure, disrupt supply chains and lead to 
financial losses for the enterprises affected. 
This, in turn, could have a negative impact on 
the solvency of those enterprises and thus in -
crease the credit risk of the bank concerned. In -
creasing drought can make agriculture more 
expensive or unprofitable in certain regions, 
have a detrimental impact on forestry, or con -
strain inland shipping and the industries that 
depend on it.2 The chart on p.  77 gives an 
overview of the possible transmission channels 
via which climate change can give rise to bank 
risks.
Given Germany’s moderate climate, the banks 
themselves state that transition risks tend to be 
more significant for the German banking sector 
than physical risks in the short term. The rele -
vant physical risks for German banks in the 
foreseeable future, according to the banks 
themselves, are primarily floods, as they can 
cause great damage – potentially even posing Transition risks

an existential threat – to debtor firms’ physical 
assets. To make matters worse, such events 
generally affect larger, contiguous areas, ren -
dering smaller banks with a highly regional 
business model especially vulnerable. More -
over, the German banking system may also be 
exposed to indirect physical risks in the wake of 
global and regional changes in climate. For ex -
ample, rising average temperatures may cause 
labour productivity to decrease or lead to 
worsening living and working conditions in 
some parts of the world or declining agricul -
tural yields. That might affect German firms’ 
suppliers and (sub)products and put existing 
value chains and processes at risk, while at the 
same time restricting German firms’ sales mar -
kets. The changed growth outlook may then 
increase credit risk for German banks.Refining banking supervision 
to cover ESG risks
ESG risks are multi- layered and complex, mean -
ing that they can affect the economy and the 
financial system through many different chan -
nels. However, ESG risks are not an entirely 
new type of risk to banking supervisors. As 
shown in the above chart, which uses climate- 
related risks as an example, ESG risks can in 
fact be understood as drivers of known risk cat -
egories such as credit or market risk. As a re -
sult, banks need to take them into account in 
their business organisation, when implement -
ing their business strategy and in their frame -
works for risk management and good govern -
ance.3ESG risks are

At the same time, though, it is very difficult to 
capture and quantify ESG risks using conven -
tional methods. The specific causal chains 
stemming from an increase in average tem -
peratures are manifold. If tipping points are 
reached in the near future, the consequences 
are likely to be far more substantial. While 
some effects are already discernible, others 
may not materialise for several years or even 
decades, significantly exceeding the usual hori -
zon of two to five years used in macroeco -
nomic scenarios for bank stress tests. What is 
more, regulatory requirements and established 
risk analysis methods are largely based on his -
torical data. However, these are only of very 
limited use in predicting how climate- related 
and environmental risks could manifest in the 
future and translate into financial risks.
Banks therefore need to develop new, forward- 
looking approaches in order to adequately 
manage climate- related risks and become more 
resilient to them. Supervisory authorities and 
standard setters have published guidance on 
this, and in some cases on ESG risks as a whole, 
at the national, European and global level in 
the form of guides on supervisory practice and 
banks’ risk management. These are intended to 
raise banks’ awareness of climate- related and 
ESG risks and help them implement supervisory 
expectations. The guides describe the possible 
transmission channels through which ESG risks 
could affect banks and present various meas -
urement methods and good practices for as -
sessing ESG risks. They are also designed to 
help banks integrate ESG risks into their risk 
management, business processes and business 
strategy.
Climate- related risks are currently the primary 
focus at the global level. The Network for 
Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which 
was established within the framework of the 
Paris Agreement, has done pioneering work on 
this issue.4 In addition, the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (BCBS) has declared 
climate- related risks a strategic priority for its 
work in the coming years.5For EU regulation, on the other hand, the en -
tire ESG spectrum is relevant.6 Thus, as part of 
the EU action plan on financing sustainable 
growth,7 the European Banking Authority (EBA) 
was given multiple mandates for the future in -
clusion of ESG risks in the European banking 
sector. In December 2019, the EBA published 
its action plan including the relevant mile -
stones.8 The EBA initially focused on the areas 
of strategy and risk management as well as dis -
closure of ESG risks. In compliance with its 
mandate under Article 98(8) of the Capital Re -
quirements Directive (CRD),9 it published a re -
port in June 2021 describing how banks should 
manage their ESG risks internally and how 
supervisors will review and evaluate this.10 The 
report defines relevant terms and presents cri -
teria and methods for identifying and measur -
ing ESG risks. The EBA also proposes three

BaFin. Sabine Mauderer, Member of the Executive Board of 
the Deutsche Bundesbank, is currently serving as Vice- Chair 
of the NGFS. The network’s goal is to analyse the implica -
tions of climate change for the financial system and to 
steer global financial flows in a way that enables low-  
carbon economic growth. In April 2019, the NGFS pre -
sented a first comprehensive report, “A call for action – Cli -
mate change as a source of financial risk”. At its core are 
six recommendations for action chiefly aimed at central 
banks, supervisors and legislators. See https://www.

5 The BCBS, whose task is to set uniform standards for 
internationally active banks, has published papers on trans -
mission channels and possible methods of measuring 
climate- related risks to the banking sector based on analyt -
ical work and a stock- taking exercise in its members’ juris -
dictions. In June 2022, the BCBS also formulated principles 
for the effective management and supervision of climate-  
related financial risks, in an effort to help harmonise super -
visory expectations about how large banks deal with these 
risks across different jurisdictions. See Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (2021b).
6 The EU has a holistic approach to sustainability that 
translates the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) 
into concrete actions. The 17 SDGs can be roughly aligned 
with the “E”, “S” and “G” of the acronym, although there 
are many interactions. For example, climate change (E) has 
implications for living and working conditions (S) in coun -
tries with an already high annual average temperature.

methods which banks can use to assess ESG 
risks depending on their business and risk strat -
egy and their risk profile.11 In its report, the EBA 
expresses the expectation that banks will also 
address their strategic objectives from an ESG 
risk perspective. It also recommends that banks 
incorporate ESG risks, inter alia, when defining 
their risk appetite, risk policies and risk metrics 
and indicators, and that they develop internal 
climate stress tests.
At the time of publication, many of the recom -
mendations and expectations set out in the 
EBA report were already included in BaFin’s 
2019 Guidance Notice on Dealing with Sustain -
ability Risks and in the ECB Guide on climate-  
related and environmental risks, published in 
2020.12 Their content and implementation by 
banks will be discussed in more detail later on.
Discussion of possible adjust -
ment of capital requirements
A great deal of progress has already been made 
in integrating ESG risks into the qualitative 
regulatory requirements regarding business 
strategy, risk management and business organ -
isation (Pillar 2 risks of the Basel regulatory 
framework).13 By contrast, work on integrating 
ESG risks into the calculation of quantitative 
regulatory requirements (Pillar 1) is still at an ex -
ploratory stage.14
In the EU, Article 501c of the Capital Require -
ments Regulation (CRR)15 mandates the EBA 
with assessing “whether a dedicated prudential 
treatment of exposures related to assets or ac -
tivities associated substantially with environ -
mental and/ or social objectives would be justi -
fied”.16 To this end, the EBA presented a discus -
sion paper in May 2022, which explores 
whether environmental risks are already suffi -
ciently taken into account in the Pillar 1 frame -
work or where changes might be possible.17 
The EBA found that the Pillar 1 framework al -
ready includes certain mechanisms that allow 
the inclusion of new types of risk drivers, such as climate-  related risks. These include the use 
of internal models, external credit ratings and 
the valuation of collateral and financial instru -
ments. However, the EBA paper also discusses 
targeted enhancements or additional clarifica -
tions within the framework which could help 
to explicitly address environmental risks. Since 
historical data are of little use in deriving 
climate- related risks, the EBA has put up the 
use of forward- looking methodologies for pub -
lic discussion.
As an alternative to recognising environmental 
risks within the existing framework, the EBA 
paper considers the advantages and disadvan -
tages of introducing specific risk- weighted ad -
justment factors. The part on credit risk con -
tains a section on the highly politically charged 
issue of the possible introduction of capital re -

method (i.e. aligning portfolios with policy objectives such 
as the emissions reduction target), (ii) the risk framework

stress tests and scenario analyses in particular) and (iii) the 
exposure method (analysing the ESG risks of individual ex -
posures, e.g. for lending).

catalogue of frequently asked questions with answers clari -
fying how climate- related financial risks could be incorpor -
ated into the calculation of risk- weighted assets for credit, 
market and operational risk and the liquidity ratio in the 
existing Pillar 1 framework. In itself, this does not yet con -
stitute an adjustment of the Basel framework, but the ad -
justment could be made at a later date, subject to the out -
comes of further work. See Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (2021).

ically desirable, it is problematic from a risk-  
oriented supervisory perspective for several rea -
sons. An initial study conducted by the NGFS in 
2020 on the risk profiles of “green” and 
“brown” assets at banks failed to come to a 
clear conclusion as to whether there is a clear 
difference between them.18 A more recent 
NGFS study also found no statistically verifiable 
differences between “green” and “brown” 
assets.19 A green supporting factor would 
therefore reduce the capital requirements for 
“green” assets, while credit risk would continue 
to exist unchanged and would not differ sys -
tematically from that of “brown” loans. How -
ever, lower capital requirements for otherwise 
equal risks could reduce banks’ ability to ab -
sorb losses. This could jeopardise the stability 
of the financial system and thus undermine the 
precondition to reliably financing the trans -
formation of the economy.
Overall, banking regulation is not a viable sub -
stitute for policy measures. Other financial and 
non- financial instruments are better suited to 
financing the decarbonisation of the economy 
and mitigating climate- related risks. For ex -
ample, an effective price for greenhouse gas 
emissions would internalise external climate 
costs and thus negatively affect the profitability 
of enterprises with environmentally harmful 
business models. This, in turn, would be taken 
into account in the regulatory framework via 
poorer credit ratings, but this time in a risk-  
oriented way.20
Introduction of supervisory 
disclosure requirements to 
strengthen market discipline
In view of the lack of data or information on 
sustainability risks, regulation at the European 
level has given transparency a high priority 
from the outset. The 2020 Taxonomy Regula -
tion formulated common definitions of “green” 
economic activities at the EU level. The tax -
onomy thus initially serves as a reference point 
for EU labels on sustainable financial products and sustainability benchmarks.21 These defin -
itions and the transparency requirements based 
on them are, however, also relevant for banks 
for another reason: large, publicly listed corpor -
ates and banks with more than 500 employees 
must disclose the extent to which their busi -
ness activities are aligned with the climate ob -
jectives of the Taxonomy Regulation. The basis 
for this is the Non- financial Reporting Directive 
(NFRD).22 When the NFRD was replaced by the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) in January 2023, the sustainability re -
porting requirement was expanded to cover a 
larger number of enterprises and the level of 
detail of the requested information was in -
creased.23 This means that suppliers and cus -
tomers of small and medium- sized enterprises 
(SMEs) in the extended user group will in future 
also have to provide additional information in a 
standardised form to ensure a consistent flow

21 The EU taxonomy is an EU- wide classification system for 
sustainable economic activities and is at the heart of the 
European Commission’s Action plan on financing sustain -
able growth, a ten- point action plan to promote sustain -
able growth in the EU published in March 2018. A regula -
tion and associated delegated acts set out what is meant 
by “green” economic activities. The creation of uniform 
definitions is crucial, particularly for mobilising and chan -
nelling private investment into environmentally sustainable 
sectors, without which it will not be possible to achieve the 
Paris climate goals or climate neutrality by 2050 as en -
shrined in the European Green Deal. See European Com -
mission (2018).

of the Council of 22  October 2014 amending Directive

p. 15). The CSRD extends the NFRD user group from large 
listed enterprises to all large enterprises and all listed enter -
prises, including listed SMEs, with proportional rules. It 
captures around 49,000 enterprises in total, instead of the 
previous figure of 11,000. The information to be provided 
covers the full ESG spectrum, taking double materiality into 
account, i.e. the impact of external influences on the enter -
prise, on the one hand, and the impact of the enterprise on 
the environment and society, on the other. The reported in -
formation is to be checked by auditors and digitally tagged

of sustainability information along the financial 
value chain. This, in turn, will allow banks to 
collect additional ESG- related data and bor -
rower information. Nevertheless, most SMEs 
will remain exempt from the obligation to pro -
vide information. As they also make up a sig -
nificant part of German banks’ credit exposure, 
there will continue to be a data gap in this area 
for the foreseeable future.
Pursuant to Article 449a of the CRR, large 
banks which have issued securities that are ad -
mitted to trading on a regulated market of any 
Member State have since mid- 2022 addition -
ally been required to disclose ESG risks as part 
of regulatory disclosure requirements (Pillar 3) 
at year- end on an annual basis. The EBA has 
developed Implementing Technical Standards 
(ITS) for this purpose. The quantitative data col -
lection initially encompasses climate- related 
and environmental risks, as they are already 
aligned with the aforementioned taxonomy. 
Furthermore, the methods and instruments for 
capturing these risks are more advanced than is 
the case for risks related to social or govern -
ance aspects. By contrast, the qualitative ques -
tions on business strategy, governance and risk 
management cover the entire ESG spectrum.
Various key performance indicators, in particu -
lar the green asset ratio (GAR), are requested 
for climate-  related and environmental risks. 
The GAR is intended to help third parties under -
stand the extent to which banks’ business ac -
tivities are aligned with the climate objectives 
of the Taxonomy Regulation. The formula for 
calculating GAR excludes exposures to com -
panies which are not subject to NFRD reporting 
obligations. As mentioned above, this typically 
concerns SMEs. Since this distorts the informa -
tive value of the GAR, the EBA proposed the 
additional introduction of a banking book tax -
onomy alignment ratio (BTAR) for its ITS. The 
BTAR is a voluntary ratio that allows banks to 
demonstrate sustainable exposures within the 
meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation, even if 
the enterprises concerned are not themselves 
subject to reporting obligations. Although such information can only be obtained bilaterally 
and on a best effort basis and therefore entails 
additional costs, it gives banks the opportunity 
to disclose additional credit exposures to sus -
tainably operating SMEs. In comparison with 
the GAR, the additional reporting of the BTAR 
thus provides a better picture of a bank’s 
taxonomy- eligible credit exposures, as such ex -
posures for which no data are otherwise dis -
closed can also feed into the calculation.
Supervisory requirements 
in the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism
In November 2020 the ECB outlined its super -
visory expectations relating to risk manage -
ment and disclosures in its Guide on climate-  
related and environmental risks.24 Amongst 
other things, it expects the impact of climate-  
related and environmental risks to be con -
sidered in the framework of their business en -
vironment, business strategy, governance and 
risk appetite, risk management and credit risk. 
The guide was developed jointly by the ECB 
and the national supervisory authorities and is 
aimed at the significant institutions (SIs) directly 
supervised by the ECB under the Single Super -
visory Mechanism (SSM).25
In 2021, on the basis of its guide, the ECB con -
ducted a detailed assessment of how SIs were 
managing and integrating climate- related and 
environmental risks. To this end, the SIs first 
had to provide a self- assessment of the extent 
to which they already met the expectations of 
the guide. They also had to outline their plans 
for further measures, including relevant mile -
stones. On this basis, the ECB examined not 
only the ability of SIs to identify climate- related 
and environmental risks in a timely manner and 
to assess and adequately manage these, but Large banks 
must report on 
the extent to 
which their busi -
ness activities 
are aligned with  
the taxonomy’s 
climate 
objectives

are climate- 
related and

practices and 
processes?

also whether SIs have properly integrated these 
risks into their practices and processes. On bal -
ance, the ECB found that banks were lagging 
behind its expectations considerably. For ex -
ample, around one- fifth of SIs had not yet inte -
grated climate- related and environmental risks 
into their business practices at all or had done 
so only to a very limited extent. At the same 
time, however, many banks had formulated ad -
equate implementation plans to address the 
identified gaps, which meant that positive de -
velopments were evident.26
Supervisors expect banks to integrate climate-  
related and environmental risks into their busi -
ness practices and risk management proced -
ures incrementally over the next few years. To 
this end, banks were set deadlines, amongst 
other things, for the binding implementation of 
the expectations set out in the ECB’s Guide on 
climate- related and environmental risks. The 
deadline for banks to implement the assess -
ment of materiality of climate- related and en -
vironmental risks in the risk inventory already 
elapsed in March 2023. The deadline for inte -
grating climate- related and environmental risks 
into risk management is end- 2023. By the end 
of 2024 banks are expected to have met all the 
remaining supervisory expectations in the ECB’s 
Guide.
Supervisory requirements at 
the national level
For German banks that are supervised at the 
national level (less significant institutions – 
LSIs), BaFin already provided non- binding guid -
ance in 2019 in the form of its “Guidance no -
tice on dealing with sustainability risks”.27 BaFin 
expects supervised entities to ensure that sus -
tainability risks are considered and that this 
process is documented. In order to support the 
supervised entities in this regard, the guidance 
notice lists numerous examples of ESG risks to 
the financial sector and presents good practice 
approaches for their consideration, particularly in the areas of risk management and business 
organisation.
The seventh amendment to the Minimum Re -
quirements for Risk Management (MaRisk), 
which is expected to be published in the first 
half of 2023, will transpose the non- binding 
guidelines from the BaFin guidance notice into 
mandatory rules. In doing so, supervisors are 
clarifying the requirements for integrating ESG 
risks into banks’ risk management and govern -
ance, and in some cases are adding even more 
extensive requirements, taking the principles of 
proportionality, materiality and methodological 
freedom into account in the process. Banks will 
be required to assess the impact of ESG risks 
– starting with climate-  related risks – not only 
at present but also in a forward- looking man -
ner. To this end, they are to use scenarios based 
on scientific findings with an appropriately long 
time horizon. The inherent uncertainty about 
the future effects of climate change, also 
known as the “green swan” problem,28 can be 
addressed using various scenarios. Based on 
the risk inventory, the MaRisk amendment ex -
plicitly stipulates that, with regard to their in -
ternal capital adequacy, business and risk strat -
egies, organisational guidelines, internal stress 
tests and reporting, banks must incorporate 
ESG risks explicitly, adequately and, where 
meaningful and possible, also quantitatively. 
This is intended to enable banks, consistent 
with their risk profile, to perform their manage -
ment functions such that ESG-  specific targets 
and risk limits are also taken into account. For 
credit processes, institutions will be required to 
include the impact of ESG risks in the assess -
ment of credit quality and the valuation of col -
lateral.Supervisory

28 In economic theory, the black swan is an extremely rare 
and unexpected event that can only be explained ex post 
due to the lack of empirical data. The green swan differs 
from the black swan in that, according to climate research 
findings, extreme climate- related risks (physical and/ or 
transition) are almost certain to materialise in the future. 
These risks can be far more systemic and complex than 
past financial crises. See Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (2020).Deutsche Bundesbank

Thematic review
On the basis of the fi  rst assessment of sig-
nifi  cant institutions (SIs) supervised by the 
ECB performed in 2021, the ECB and the 
national supervisory authorities conducted 
a thematic review in 2022 that covered a 
total of 107 SIs and 79 less signifi  cant insti-
tutions (LSIs), which are under the direct 
supervision of the national authorities. As 
part of the review, they conducted deep 
dives into SIs’ relevant risk management 
practices and analysed the progress made 
by the SIs since the fi  rst assessment.
BaFin and the Bundesbank, together with 
national supervisory authorities from seven 
other countries in the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism (SSM), participated in the the-
matic review with selected large LSIs. A 
total of 17 German LSIs were subject to the 
review.
In early November 2022, the ECB published 
a comprehensive report1 on the results of 
the thematic review as well as a compen-
dium of good practices observed at the SIs.2
Compared with other institutions, German 
SIs were within the average in both the 
2021 assessment and the 2022 thematic re-
view. The fi  rst assessment in 2021 revealed 
that the practices of German SIs, like most 
other banks in the SSM, were still far from 
being aligned with supervisory expect-
ations. The thematic review in 2022 showed 
that almost all SIs had developed at least 
basic practices for the majority of supervis-
ory expectations. However, even though 
most SIs anticipate that climate- related and 
environmental risks could have a consider-
able impact on their business activities in 
the short to medium term, the majority of 
banks still fall short –  signifi  cantly so in 
some cases  – of adequately managing climate- related and environmental risks in 
certain areas. The methodologies behind 
banks’ practices are not mature, and there 
is also a lack of granular data. Overall, only 
around half of the SIs are fully and effect-
ively implementing the practices that they 
have developed. As for the LSIs, German 
banks are, on average, performing better 
than LSIs from other countries in some 
areas, but they, too, are still in the early 
stages of adequately dealing with climate- 
related and environmental risks. The major-
ity of German LSIs have implemented only 
“basic practices” that will not meet future 
supervisory expectations. It is particularly 
notable that most German LSIs exhibit 
shortcomings with respect to the quantita-
tive analysis of climate- related and environ-
mental risks. There are no specifi  c key per-
formance indicators for effective risk man-
agement and mitigation. Only a few Ger-
man LSIs had advanced practices, 
particularly in the area of credit risk man-
agement.

All in all, it is very challenging to identify, assess 
and manage ESG risks. Not only is there a lack 
of data, but also often a lack of knowledge or 
experience with regard to integrating ESG risks 
into existing methods or developing new ones. 
It is also difficult to take potential longer- term 
ESG risks into account in the risk inventory and 
stress tests. The attendant necessity of using 
approximative and qualitative approaches at 
first may suffice for now. However, it is crucial 
that banks develop realistic plans to gradually 
close data and methodology gaps.
Analyses of financial risks 
stemming from climate 
change
New and improved analytical methods are 
needed to assess the impact on the financial 
sector of risks stemming from climate change. 
Although major progress has been made in this 
area over the past few years, the quantification 
of climate-  related financial risks remains a 
major challenge for both supervisors and the 
financial industry. Climate- related data, such as 
enterprises’ direct and indirect greenhouse gas 
emissions, are only available to a limited extent, 
as they are difficult to collect, especially from 
smaller enterprises. A survey of small and 
medium- sized German banks as part of the 
2022 LSI stress test showed that data gaps are 
the key reason why the majority of banks cur -
rently only consider climate- related risks indir -
ectly in their risk management.
The challenges outlined above apply in particu -
lar to the modelling of risks in the context of 
scenario analyses and stress tests,29 which are 
already being used by various supervisory au -
thorities to quantify climate- related risks in the 
financial system.30 The effects of climate-  
related risks on the real economy and the finan -
cial system vary considerably. For example, 
some sectors cause high emissions of climate- 
damaging greenhouse gases and are therefore 
exposed to higher transition risks than other 
sectors of the economy.31 The heterogeneous transmission of climate- related risks places new 
demands on the design of stress tests. Climate 
risk stress tests therefore differ from conven -
tional stress tests not only in that they have a 
much more much more specific –  but also 
more granular – reference dataset, but also in 
their modelling approach, which maps the ef -
fects of climate- related risk to individual bor -
rowers as precisely as possible.
Most climate risk stress tests are based on the 
scenarios developed by the NGFS.32 These 
scenarios use integrated assessment models 
(IAMs) to model the global macroeconomic im -
pact of various climate pathways up to 2100. 
They are developed by an international consor -
tium of climate research institutions and central 
banks that also ensures they are consistent 
with the forecasts of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change. In an “orderly” tran -
sition33 to global net zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050, prompt policy measures 
limit global warming to below 1.4˚C by 2100. A 
“disorderly” transition34 achieves the same ob -
jective, albeit at a higher cost owing to diver -
ging or delayed measures. In the “hot house Modelling 
the effects of 
climate  change 
is challenging
Heterogeneous 
transmission of 
climate- related 
risks places new 
demands on 
stress tests29 Scenario analyses and stress tests are established super -
visory analytical tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in 
the financial sector. The aim of the regular supervisory 
stress tests is to analyse the resilience of banks in a very ad -
verse yet realistic economic environment. At the consoli -
dated level, the results are used to identify potential sys -
tematic risks. At the single entity level, they serve as an 
early warning indicator and – in the case of solvency stress 
tests – as a basis for setting the supervisory guidance on 
additional own funds.
30 Owing to these uncertainties, the main objective of cli -
mate risk stress tests and scenario analyses is not to provide 
a precise point estimate for the current risk at a bank, but 
rather to estimate its magnitude and importance for vari -
ous sets of circumstances and development paths.

options from a central bank perspective, see also Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022).

33 The NGFS models two orderly transitions with varying 
degrees of ambition. The statements refer to the “Net Zero 
2050” scenario. Besides this, the “Below 2  °C” scenario is 
also seen as an orderly, albeit less ambitious transition.
34 Two disorderly transition scenarios are also modelled: 
“Divergent Net Zero” and “Delayed Transition”. The climate 
risk stress test presented here uses a scenario based on a 
“Delayed Transition”.Deutsche Bundesbank

Structured survey of sustainability risks in supervisory 
 meetings
In the fi  rst quarter of 2022, the Bundesbank, 
in consultation with BaFin, began collecting 
data on the way in which banks supervised at 
the national level deal with sustainability risks 
during the institutions’ annual supervisory 
meetings. The aim of this structured survey 
was to gain an idea of the state of play with 
respect to banks’ implementation of previ-
ously non- binding supervisory standards in 
the areas of strategy, responsible governance, 
business organisation and the management 
of environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
risks. At the same time, it made banks aware 
of supervisory expectations contained in the 
seventh amendment to the Minimum Re-
quirements for Risk Management (MaRisk). A 
total of 810 banks participated in the struc-
tured survey, including 443 cooperative banks, 
229 savings banks, 86 commercial banks, 10 
building and loan associations and 11 promo-
tional banks.
Just over half of the banks surveyed reported 
that they were in the planning phase or the 
early stages of the implementation phase with 
regard to integrating ESG risks into their busi-
ness practices. They perceive ESG risks as pri-
marily affecting credit and reputational risk. 
However, perceptions vary depending on the 
category of banks (see the adjacent chart). For 
example, savings banks cited ESG factors as 
primarily having an impact on legal risk and 
other operational risks, whereas cooperative 
banks see ESG risks as translating fi  rst and 
foremost into credit risk/ counterparty default 
risk. Nevertheless, their impact on the overall 
risk profi  le and the overall risk situation across 
all banks is limited. All in all, only 215 banks 
(27%) identifi  ed ESG factors as contributing to 
the materiality of one or more types of risk.
In its guidance notice, BaFin recommends that 
the entities and banks it supervises anchor 
ESG risks in their business strategy and critic-
ally review their business lines for interde-
pendencies with ESG risks. According to the 
survey, 70% of the participating banks have 
already done this, with 173 banks (21%) hav-
ing developed their own sustainability strat-egy. The primary methods for managing and/ 
or mitigating ESG risks within the scope of 
business strategy are formulating sustainabil-
ity objectives and other commitments, such as 
engaging in dialogue with counterparties that 
present a signifi  cant sustainability risk. Far- 
reaching measures, such as discontinuing 
lines of business or managing risks through 
the exercise of voting rights, have so far rarely 
been undertaken in practice (see the left- hand 
chart on p. 86). Risk strategy methods are im-
plemented less frequently on average than 
business strategy methods. The majority of 
the banks surveyed have set ESG- specifi  c 
limits or made sector- specifi  c exclusions. In 
addition, around one- fi  fth of the commercial 
banks surveyed report devising other methods, 
such as investment strategies (see the right- 
hand chart on p. 86).
The majority of the banks surveyed (59%) al-
ready include ESG risks in their regular risk in-

ventory, and one- third of the banks (36%) 
have incorporated ESG risks into their written 
risk management guidelines.1 With regard to 
conducting ESG- related stress tests and scen-
ario analyses, 26% of respondents stated that 
they had conducted these tests or planned to 
do so in 2022. A large percentage of commer-
cial banks (35%) reported that they did not in-
tend to conduct scenario analyses or stress 
tests in the future.
Overall, the survey shows that there is still a 
lot of work to be done by the banks if they 
are to fully satisfy the future supervisory re-
quirements set out in the seventh amendment 
to MaRisk. First and foremost, it needs to be 
ensured that there are fundamental methods 
and processes in place to determine the ma-teriality of ESG risks. This, together with the 
parallel establishment by banks of a quantita-
tive database, will be the focus of supervision 
over the next few years. In this context, the 
way in which institutional associations set the 
pace in the German banking sector should 
not be underestimated. This is because 77% 
of all banks in Germany belong to the German 
Savings Banks and Giro Association (Deutscher 
Sparkassen- und Giroverband) or the Associ-
ation of Cooperatives (Genossenschaftsver-
band).

world” scenario,35 by contrast, global warming 
rises to 3˚C as the current level of policy ambi -
tion is not exceeded.36
The NGFS scenarios are not generally designed 
to be stress scenarios. Unlike conventional stress 
tests, climate risk stress tests do not have a 
clear baseline scenario. Instead, the different 
scenarios are intended to model the most real -
istic pathways possible for the environment 
and the economy, depending on current and 
future climate policy measures. The individual 
scenarios therefore differ greatly in their degree 
of transition and physical risks, and thus also 
their potential stress effect.37 The very long 
horizon over which the NGFS scenarios take 
place presents another challenge, as estab -
lished frameworks for bank stress testing usu -
ally work with fairly short forecast horizons.38
Results of previous climate- 
related scenario analyses and 
stress tests
Irrespective of the challenges outlined above, 
supervisors and central banks have already con -
ducted a number of climate risk stress tests and 
scenario analyses. For example, in its 2021 
Financial Stability Review, the Bundesbank pre -
sented a climate-  related scenario analysis that 
examined how transition risks could affect 
portfolios in the German financial sector.39 The 
impact on the financial sector was fairly moder -
ate owing to the relatively low losses in macro -
economic value added in the NGFS scenarios 
used. Compared to insurers and funds, the 
banking sector showed the lowest level of vul -
nerability here.
In 2022, the ECB conducted a climate risk stress 
test for around 100 SIs.40 This exercise analysed 
one short- term and three long- term transition 
risk scenarios and two acute physical risk scen -
arios (flood risk and drought and heat risk).41 
The losses projected in the short- term scenario 
were fairly moderate overall.42 The long- term 
projections show that so far, banks are having trouble adapting their strategies effectively to 
the various scenarios.
These results are largely consistent with those 
of climate risk stress tests conducted by other 
supervisory authorities (including De Neder -
landsche Bank and Banque de France; see the 
table on p. 91), which show that the estimated 
losses tend to be lower for banks than for in -
surers and funds, that their extent depends on 
how carbon- intensive the borrowing economic 
sector is, and that they are lower in the long 
term in an orderly transition than on other cli -
mate policy pathways.
Losses projected 
in the short- term 
ECB scenarios 
were moderate 
overall35 Alongside the “Current Policies” scenario, the NGFS has 
established the “Nationally Determined Contributions” 
scenario, which also belongs to the “Hot House World” 
category. The latter scenario takes into account heterogen -
eity and different levels of ambition in policy measures to 
prevent climate change.
36 Amongst other things, the plan under the European 
Commission’s European Green Deal is to ensure there are 
no net emissions of greenhouse gases within the EU from 
2050 onwards. However, this policy objective cannot be 
directly assigned to one of the NGFS scenarios.
37 An orderly transition towards a climate- neutral econ -
omy is the most desirable option from a long- term macro -
economic and climate policy perspective. Compared to 
other scenarios, an orderly transition minimises economic 
downturns and long- term physical damage resulting from 
rising global temperatures. However, more transition risks 
materialise in an orderly transition than in a “hot house 
world” scenario in which no or hardly any measures are 
taken to contain global warming and its consequences. In 
turn, the “hot house world” scenario is dominated by the 
physical damage caused by climate change and its negative 
long- run impact on the economy.
38 On the one hand, the forecast horizon for stress tests is 
usually three to five years and balance sheets are assumed 
to be static. However, this is becoming increasingly unreal -
istic due to the lack of adjustment responses over a longer 
period of time. On the other hand, forecasts over such a 
long period of time are naturally subject to a high degree 
of uncertainty. Banks’ planning horizon does not generally 
exceed three to five years, for instance. Therefore, the cli -
mate risk stress tests carried out so far have either focused 
(exclusively) on the shorter term, in which transition risks 
generally predominate, or have tried to make the most 
realistic assumptions possible as to how business will de -
velop over the next few decades for longer- term analyses.

The Bundesbank’s climate risk stress test
The climate risk analyses conducted by the 
Bundesbank so far have taken a predomin-
antly macroprudential view. But what mat-
ters in particular for banking supervisors is 
the microprudential perspective – that is, 
the view at the level of individual institu-
tions. That is why the Bundesbank has also 
developed a climate risk stress test specially 
for banks. This stress test is conducted as a 
top- down exercise – i.e. without any in-
volvement on the part of the banks – and 
the plan is to give supervisors scope to fl  ex-
ibly analyse banks’ robustness to various cli-
mate scenarios going forward. Two adverse 
scenarios and one baseline scenario are 
analysed as part of this stress test. The latter 
is based on the NGFS’s Current Policies 
scenario, while one adverse scenario ex-
pands upon the NGFS’s Net Zero 2050 
scenario and the other is an explicit short- 
term stress scenario based on a DSGE ap-
proach that simulates an abrupt increase in 
the price of carbon to €200 per tonne.
The methodology is being developed pri-
marily to estimate the impact of transition 
risks in the near term, which offers two 
benefi  ts. First, it improves comparability 
with existing stress tests and second, it miti-
gates the problem that model uncertainty 
increases disproportionately for longer time 
horizons. One notable reason why uncer-
tainty increases disproportionately over 
long time horizons is that dynamic balance 
sheets – that is, adjustments not just by the 
bank but also by non- fi  nancial corporations 
(the borrowers) to the environment under 
observation – have to be simulated.1 To ad-
dress this issue, the Bundesbank uses cli-
mate scenarios that differ from one another 
mainly in terms of the size of the carbon 
price2 increases they simulate. These scen-
arios are then converted into stressed fi  nan-
cial metrics, such as banks’ profi  tability.3 This is done using granular annual fi  nancial 
statement information and data on green-
house gas emissions at the fi  rm level, on 
the basis of which stressed probabilities of 
default (PDs) and loss given default ratios 
(LGDs) are computed for borrowers. In par-
allel, a macroeconomic model is deployed 
to quantify how the scenarios impact on 
average PDs and LGDs in individual eco-
nomic sectors. Owing to the complete lack 
of historical comparative data that could be 
used for validation purposes, credit risk par-
ameters are estimated using various model-
ling approaches to allow an assessment of 
the quality and robustness of the results. As 
a fi  nal step, the stressed fi  rm and sector 
metrics are used to calculate provisions at 
the individual bank level.
The fi  rst results from the climate risk stress 
test are consistent with fi  ndings from ana-
lyses conducted by other supervisory au-
thorities. The potential risks that the transi-
tion to a climate- neutral economy presents 
for the German banking sector appear to 
be fairly moderate overall, based on the 
current NGFS scenarios, with the modelled 
aggregate loss for all German banks 
amounting to around €16 billion. Express-
1 A static balance sheet would mean that banks and 
fi  rms, too, do not adjust their business models and 
carry out every single transaction just as they would 
have done prior to the simulated shock, i.e. without 
taking the incoming data from the scenario into ac-
count. This is a very hard assumption that is reasonable 
only for fairly short time horizons.
2 Though the term “carbon price” might suggest 
otherwise at fi  rst glance, this variable encompasses 
more than just the market price for carbon. Rather, it 
serves as a collective variable that comprises all the 
policy measures that are designed to have an impact 
on emissions activity.
3 The fi  rst iteration of the climate risk stress test used 
the NGFS’s Net Zero 2050 and Current Policies scen-
arios. The Net Zero 2050 scenario represents an or-
derly transition with an increase in the price of carbon, 
while the Current Policies scenario assumes that cur-
rently implemented policies are preserved and thus 
serves as a reference scenario.Deutsche Bundesbank

ing that fi  gure as a percentage of the 
stressed corporate loan portfolio of roughly 
€2,100 billion produces a relative loss of 
around 0.76%. The loss rate is unlikely to be 
any higher than this because other model 
specifi  cations lead to lower losses. Needless 
to say, certain banks may be impacted more 
heavily if a large share of their borrowers 
are particularly exposed to transition risks. 
Another insight produced by the Bundes-
bank’s climate risk stress test is that transi-
tion risks can be spread very heteroge-
neously across regions. Especially for banks 
with a strong regional focus, this could 
mean taking a more active approach to 
managing the loan portfolio as a way of 
evading such risks. That said, a comparison 
with conventional stress tests reveals that 
the results they produce say very little in-
deed about how a bank will fare in a cli-
mate risk stress test. That is why climate- 
related risks need to be explicitly modelled 
and analysed. Climate risk stress testing and 
scenario analyses complement prudential 
risk analyses and are a useful tool for ana-
lysing how climate- specifi  c risk scenarios 
impact on banks. By enhancing and refi  ning 
the scenarios and models used and improv-
ing the underlying dataset, the quantifi  ca-
tion of climate- related risks can be made 
more robust going forward. With this aim 
in mind, the Bundesbank will regularly up-
date and review its risk assessment.
A schematic diagram presenting the meth-
odology behind the Bundesbank’s climate 
risk stress test can be found in the adjacent 
chart. As with a variety of other exercises, 
the NGFS’s climate scenarios provide the 
groundwork for this stress test. In the eco-
nomic model underpinning these scenarios, 
it is not possible to disaggregate the effects 
by country and economic sector at the 
same time. However, a sectoral disaggrega-
tion of the German economy is crucially im-
portant if the climate risk stress test is to 
work properly, which is why disaggregated scenario variables calculated by means of a 
production network model are used.4 The 
macroeconomic scenario variables form 
part of the underlying dataset alongside 
credit relationships and other loan, balance 
sheet and profi  t and loss data from fi  rms as 
well as data on fi  rms’ direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions.
The methodology is built around the mod-
elling of fi  rm- level PDs and LGDs, based on 
a micro and a macro approach. Drawing on 
established methods for modelling PDs as 
part of stress tests, the micro approach con-

sists of three steps. First, an empirical model 
is used to derive historical dynamics be-
tween fi  rm PDs and a series of explanatory 
corporate metrics (including profi  tability 
and leverage ratio). Second, the relevant 
key fi  nancial metrics are projected across 
the entire scenario horizon based on the 
scenarios and using balance sheet assump-
tions. Third, the extrapolated values of 
these metrics are fed into the model and 
then converted into stressed PDs.5 LGDs are 
modelled based on how borrowers’ capital 
ratios evolve in conjunction with the loan 
collateral provided. This approach allows 
the transmission of climate scenarios into 
stressed fi  rm- level parameters to be mod-
elled in a granular fashion. In parallel to the 
micro approach, a macro approach is also 
employed to allow users to assess the qual-
ity and robustness of results with the aid of 
independent modelling approaches. This 
macro approach centres around an estab-
lished credit risk model that identifi  es his-
torical dynamics between credit risk param-
eters (PDs and LGDs) and macroeconomic 
scenario variables and converts them into 
stressed credit risk parameters in a consist-
ent manner. This model has been enhanced 
and refi  ned to also allow sector- specifi  c 
paths to be estimated for credit risk param-
eters. Furthermore, various specifi  cations 
and restrictions have been adapted to allow 
for the novel nature of climate risk model-
ling. The fi  rm and sector- specifi  c output 
from both approaches are then blended 
with a view to mapping the credit risk par-
ameters of borrowers of German banks as 
comprehensively as possible. Firm- specifi  c 
loss rates are calculated as a product of PDs 
and LGDs. As a fi  nal step, the modelled 
fi  rm- level loss rates are connected to bank 
data based on existing credit relationships. 
By multiplying fi  rm- specifi  c lending volumes 
and loss rates, it is possible to compute pro-
visions for each bank that refl  ect the stress 
effect produced in each scenario. For now, 
only loan exposures to fi  rms are being ana-lysed; going forward, the model will be 
gradually expanded to incorporate other 
exposure classes (e.g. real estate- secured 
exposures and retail exposures) and also 
physical risks.
The methodology behind the Bundesbank’s 
climate risk stress test is comparable to the 
exercises conducted by other European 
supervisory authorities (summarised in the 
table on p. 91). The risk assessment in other 
climate risk stress tests was carried out at 
least at the sector level; wherever possible, 
it was modelled at the fi  rm level as well. 
Both the supervisory authorities that con-
ducted calculations of their own using a 
top- down approach and the banks that had 
to provide data in the bottom- up approach 
reported facing a similar set of challenges. 
The limited availability of granular (climate- 
related) data was an issue, and new stress 
test models had to be developed, or exist-
ing ones expanded, to be able to map cli-
mate risks as adequately as is possible at 
the present time. Because separate data 
sources and methodologies need to be 
used when quantifying transition risks and 
physical risks, and since transition risks pre-
dominate in the short term (which is com-
mon for stress tests), some exercises fo-
cused on this aspect only. Compared with 
traditional stress tests, the climate risk stress 
tests looked only at the credit risk and mar-
ket risk channels for the most part.6 Thanks 
to these exercises, both supervisory author-
ities and banks have already made signifi  -
cant progress in quantifying climate- related 
risks, but there is still room for develop-
ment.
5 This approach is based on the assumption that the 
relationship between PDs and fi  nancial metrics will not 
change signifi  cantly in future.
6 Other channels, such as interest rate risk and oper-
ational risk, were usually omitted because they were 
(presumed to be) less material for analysing climate- 
related risks.Deutsche Bundesbank

Outlook
Climate change presents a major challenge to 
banks and the financial system as a whole. 
Banking supervision and banking regulation 
must ensure that the risks in the banking sector 
are taken into account adequately, i.e. in a risk- 
oriented manner. Risk-  oriented regulation and 
supervisory practice are not suitable as primary 
management tools for climate objectives. In -
stead, these objectives should be tackled 
through the economic and fiscal policy meas -
ures taken since the Paris Agreement in order 
to pursue the 1.5 °C target. They include instru -
ments such as carbon taxation and caps on 
emissions.
Over the past few years, significant progress 
has been made in advancing supervisory prac -
tices and raising the standards for banks to 
meet in integrating climate- related risks into 
their risk assessment. However, the work is far 
from complete. From a regulatory perspective, 
the Basel framework is currently being re -
viewed with regard to climate- related risks. The 
ongoing revision to the CRR and the CRD, re -
ferred to as the “European banking package”, 
currently envisages several ESG- related man -
dates for the EBA. For instance, it will be re -
sponsible for developing guidelines for climate- 
related scenario analyses and stress tests. As 
the capturing of climate- related factors be -
comes increasingly common, the data needed 
to assess risks are gradually becoming available 
through reporting.
In addition, the topic of biodiversity, another 
sub- category of environmental risk, is gaining 
more attention within Europe and globally. The 
coronavirus pandemic has further heightened 
awareness of the link between infectious dis -
eases and unsustainable developments in agri -
culture or, for example, the loss of forest areas. 
Numerous initiatives to prevent and reverse bi -
odiversity loss have been launched at the G7 
and G20 level, as well as by the United Nations, 
amongst others.At the European level, work on the European 
Union’s social taxonomy is also being con -
tinued. This is intended to create a classification 
system for economic activities with regard to 
social and human rights criteria and will sup -
plement the existing “green” taxonomy.43 
Overall, the success of ESG regulation will rely 
heavily on a clear and consistent definition of 
social and governance factors. These develop -
ments will also require banking supervisors to 
build up additional knowledge in order to bet -
ter analyse and assess the risks associated with 
biodiversity and social aspects in and for the 
banking sector.
Supervisors will focus on the progress made by 
banks in implementing the existing require -
ments over the next few years. The ECB has 
made climate- related risks a strategic priority 
for its supervisory activities in the period 
2022-2024.44 In the years thereafter, the ECB is 
planning to monitor remedial actions, review 
banks’ implementation plans, conduct targeted 
deep- dive reviews in relation to selected as -
pects and focus on climate- related and envir -
onmental risks when carrying out on- site in -
spections. Furthermore, climate- related and en -
vironmental risk management is to be gradually 
integrated into the methodology of the Super -
visory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) via 
qualitative and quantitative requirements.
BaFin and the Bundesbank have also defined 
ESG risks as a medium- term issue to focus on in 
the period up to 2025. In supervisory practice, 
the intention is to regularly address ESG risks in 
supervisory discussions and to intensify dia -
logue with the banking associations. Going for -
ward, on- site inspections will focus on ESG as -
pects and assessments regarding the manage -
ment of ESG risks will be integrated into the 
SREP process. The findings from ESG reporting 
43 On 28  February 2022, the Platform on Sustainable 
Finance presented its final report, including proposals for 
the design of a social taxonomy. See Platform on Sustain -
able Finance.

and the Bundesbank’s climate risk stress test 
will support the ongoing work.
The development of transition plans will be key 
to the successful continuation of work, particu -
larly in the area of climate- related risks. A tran -
sition plan is a detailed, multi- year presentation 
of the objectives and measures established by 
an enterprise to align its business model and 
strategy with specific environmental objectives. The NGFS and the BCBS are currently working 
intensively on how banks’ transition plans – or, 
more precisely, transition planning processes – 
can be used effectively. Assessing banks’ transi -
tion planning processes will require very close 
cooperation with the real economy. Ultimately, 
it is the transition plans of banks’ corporate 
customers that will play a key role in banks’ 
transition planning processes.

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

an agreed maturity and all loans excluding revolving loans and overdrafts, credit card

ures based on the quarterly figures of the Federal Statistical Office, core budgets and
off-budget entities which are assigned to the general government sector.  2 The annual
figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state
and local government.  5 On the revenue side, this contains proceeds booked as dis-
posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from
2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from
2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
