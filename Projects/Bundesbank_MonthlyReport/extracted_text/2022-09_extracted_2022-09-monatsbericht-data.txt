Economic conditions
Underlying trends
There are mounting signs of a recession in the 
German economy in the sense of a significant, 
broad- based and sustained decline in economic 
output.1 This is mainly due to the considerable 
deterioration in aggregate supply conditions 
– especially energy supply – as a result of Rus -
sia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. High 
inflation and uncertainty regarding the supply 
of energy and its costs will affect not only gas 
and electricity- intensive industries and their ex -
port business and investment, but also private 
consumption and those service providers de -
pendent on it.
After managing a slight increase in the second 
quarter, economic output is likely to fall some -
what in the current quarter. July had already 
got off to a mixed start. The retail sector, for 
example, was able to expand its sales in real 
terms, and the elimination of most of the 
coronavirus protective measures has probably 
continued to have a slight impact on food ser -
vices and tourism. However, industrial and 
main construction output was noticeably down 
on the month. According to the ifo Institute, 
enterprises expressed less satisfaction with 
their current business in August and were still 
pessimistic about the future outlook. According 
to S&P Global, purchasing managers reported 
falling business in industry and services. The 
consumer climate index calculated by the mar -
ket research institute GfK dropped for the third 
time in succession to reach a new historical 
low, mainly due to a sharp increase in con -
sumers’ propensity to save.
The gloom present in the German economy 
and among consumers also reflects the recent 
intensification of supply squeezes in the gas 
market, which also affects electricity prices. 
Now that Russia’s gas deliveries to Germany have largely been terminated, the gas supply 
situation will be extremely tight in the coming 
months. As things currently stand, though, 
even without deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 
pipeline, it was just about possible to avoid for -
mal steps towards rationing of gas thanks to 
larger deliveries from other countries and pro -
gress in energy efficiency and gas storage. 
However, this will require a further, consider -
able reduction in gas consumption – especially 
among households. The effects of gas savings 
partly resemble those of rationing if firms cut 
production for economic reasons or halt it al -
together. Economic output is likely to decline 
markedly in the fourth quarter overall, with this 
situation likely to apply to the first quarter of 
next year, too. From today’s perspective, there 
is no reason to fear a slump in the magnitude 
of the adverse scenario outlined in the June 
projection.2 The outlook is extremely uncertain, 
however.
Industry
In July, industrial output fell distinctly on the 
month in seasonally adjusted terms despite an 
easing of material shortages (-1%).3 It remained 
unchanged when compared with the second 
quarter, however. High energy costs weighed 
on the energy- intensive sectors, with output in 
the chemical industries dropping sharply, fol -

1 In addition to these three standard recession criteria, 
underutilisation of aggregate capacity can also be cited; 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2019a and 2019b). By contrast, 
the term “technical recession” is used if real gross domes -
tic product (GDP) drops in two consecutive quarters, irre -
spective of the depth and breadth of the decline.
2 In the adverse scenario, in addition to a permanent stop -
page of Russian energy supplies, other unfavourable as -
sumptions were made which have not materialised so far; 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022). The relief measures re -
cently announced by the Federal Government are also likely 
to mitigate the expected decline in GDP somewhat.

of the year. The production of intermediate 
goods was slightly lower overall. There was 
also a significant inter- industry decline in the 
production of consumer goods, with furniture 
manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry 
suffering a particularly severe impact. By con -
trast, the production of capital goods was up 
markedly, with considerable increases recorded 
for computer equipment, electronic and optical 
products and for other transport equipment. 
The production of motor vehicles and motor 
vehicle parts was distinctly higher than in the 
second quarter, although data from the Ger -
man Association of the Automotive industry 
(VDA) suggest that the timing of the school 
holidays played a role here. These figures show 
a sharp fall in the number of passenger cars 
manufactured in August, which stood roughly 
at the level of the second quarter on an aver -
age of the two holiday months.
In July, industrial new orders maintained their 
persistent downward trend since the beginning 
of the year, falling distinctly on both the month 
and the quarter. Domestic orders dropped 
steeply. By contrast, export orders rose slightly 
overall. New orders from non- euro area coun -
tries increased sharply, while those from euro 
area countries declined steeply. Orders of inter -
mediate goods were up markedly. Demand for 
capital goods fell somewhat, though motor ve -
hicle orders still provided support. Excluding 
motor vehicles, new orders for capital goods 
sank sharply. Orders for consumer goods were 
the lowest they had been since February 2021, 
with lower demand for pharmaceutical prod -
ucts being the main contributing factor. Over -
all, new orders have now fallen significantly 
from their peak levels in the summer of 2021, 
although in July they were still around 4% 
above the pre- pandemic level in the fourth 
quarter of 2019. Notwithstanding the burdens 
and potential production constraints caused by 
high energy prices, the orders that have now 
accumulated are likely to at least serve as a cer -
tain buffer against the slowing demand – as 
long as there are no significant cancellations. 
There are no indications of these so far. Order Industrial new 
orders continue

books continued to rise in June as well, reach -
ing a new peak.
In July, nominal industrial sales declined some -
what on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms, but were still well above their level of 
the second quarter, in which they had grown 
substantially. There was a slight quarter-  on- 
quarter rise after price adjustment, too. From a 
regional perspective, growth in nominal sales 
abroad was significantly stronger than in Ger -
many, with sales in euro area countries and 
non- euro area countries alike up steeply. 
Broken down by sector, capital goods produ -
cers, in particular, contributed to the increase in 
industrial sales. The mechanical engineering 
and automotive sectors sold significantly more 
products. Sales of intermediate goods rose 
slightly, while sales figures for consumer goods 
fell significantly. The pharmaceutical industry 
recorded a severe drop in sales – particularly in 
Germany, where sales contracted by more than 
one- third compared with the second quarter. 
In July, nominal exports of goods fell clearly on 
the month in seasonally adjusted terms, but 
were still higher than in the second quarter. 
After price adjustment, however, they were 
down substantially on the month and distinctly 
lower than in the previous quarter. Exports to 
non- euro area countries decreased significantly 
more sharply than exports to the euro area. 
Nominal imports of goods declined markedly in 
July compared with the previous month and 
were also down slightly on the second quarter. 
With import prices for energy rising sharply, the 
decline in imports was considerable in real 
terms on both the month and quarter.
Construction
In July, seasonally adjusted construction output 
rose markedly on the month (+1½%) and was 
slightly above its level of the second quarter 
(+½%). The finishing trades were the key factor 
here, whereas output in the main construction 
sector saw a marked deceleration. This could 
signal a cooling- off in the construction sector. The massive rise in construction costs and 
prices and higher financing costs are likely to 
have dampened demand substantially. New 
orders in the main construction sector fell ex -
ceptionally sharply in the second quarter com -
pared with the previous quarter (-13½%). The 
decline was broadly based across all sectors. 
The order books are still well filled, however. 
This is indicated by the reach of the order 
books, calculated by the ifo Institute, which re -
mained high in a long- term comparison despite 
a renewed slight decline in August.
Labour market
The labour market is showing resilience in the 
face of the deteriorating economic outlook. 
Employment grew moderately in July after the 
pace had slowed down significantly in the 
second quarter. In July, the seasonally adjusted 
number of persons in work overall went up by 
23,000 on the month. The filling of jobs sub -
ject to social security contributions, which have 
already been exceeding their pre- pandemic 
level since the second quarter of 2021, is a 
driver of the ongoing slightly positive develop -
ment in employment. In addition, exclusively 
low- paid employment, reduced considerably 
during the pandemic and depressed up to now, 
recovered somewhat in the second quarter. 
This was partly due to renewed demand for la -
bour in the trade and accommodation and 
food service sectors. The use of cyclical short-  
time working continued to decline throughout 
the reporting period. In recent months, the 
number of new registrations for short- time 
work was as low as it was pre- pandemic. Lead -
ing indicators, such as enterprises’ hiring inten -
tions, remained mostly in slightly positive terri -
tory.
Registered unemployment continued to rise in 
August, albeit only slightly. In seasonally ad -
justed terms, the number of unemployed per -
sons increased by 28,000 to 2.50 million. The 
unemployment rate went up by 0.1 percentage 
point to 5.5%. Ukrainian refugees have been Decline in

included in the German social security system 
since June of this year. They receive mainly 
basic benefits in accordance with the Second 
Book of the Social Security Code (SGB II) and 
depending on availability are thus registered as 
unemployed. This explains the rise in the un -
employment rate by a total of 0.5 percentage 
point over the past three months.4 Unemploy -
ment could potentially continue to increase 
over the coming months. The IAB unemploy -
ment barometer remained almost unchanged 
in negative territory in August. The subdued la -
bour market developments in the face of a dif -
ficult economic environment come on top of 
further burdens related to the integration of 
refugees into the labour market.
Prices
The European energy crisis escalated further in 
recent weeks. Because deliveries from Russia 
via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline were initially cut 
back and have now been terminated al -
together, gas prices rose sharply and temporar -
ily soared to an all- time high of €314 per mega -
watt hour at the end of August. Although 
prices went back down significantly in Septem -
ber, the cost of a megawatt hour was still more 
than 200% higher than in the previous year. In 
addition, as in some other European countries 
as well, the wholesale electricity price climbed 
upward in step with the price for gas. By con -
trast, the price of Brent crude oil was trending 
downwards slightly, reaching US$90 per barrel 
at the end of the reporting period.
Owing to sustained price pressure on the Euro -
pean gas and electricity markets, the excep -
tionally high price increases seen in the past 
few months continued at the upstream stages 
of the economy. In July, annual inflation for im -
ports was 29% and for domestic products 
37%. The energy component continued to be 
the key driving force. In domestic sales, price 
dynamics for energy and for capital goods and 
consumer goods clearly accelerated again. By 
contrast, intermediate goods price inflation, both for imports and domestic products, 
posted a slight fall recently.
Following the temporary slowdown in June 
due to the relief package, consumer price infla -
tion already intensified again in July and re -
mained strong in August. In August, the Har -
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose 
by 8.8% on the year, just over 0.3 percentage 
point more than in July.5 Prices of unprocessed 
food, in particular, drove this new surge in 
prices. In addition, the strong price dynamics 
continued for processed food as well as for in -
dustrial goods and services. Consumer prices 
for energy remained at their high levels.
According to preliminary information, follow -
ing the expiry of the €9 ticket and the fuel re -
bate on 1 September 2022, prices soared for 
both public transport and for petrol and diesel. 
This will lead to further price increases in en -
ergy and services in the current month and a 
correspondingly higher inflation rate. By con -
trast, measures announced in the third relief 
package, such as the gas levy or the brake on 
electricity prices, will probably not feed through 
to consumer prices until the beginning of next 
year. The inflation rate is likely to move into 
double- digit territory over the next few months 
overall.Temporary surge

4 According to the Federal Employment Agency, un -
employment went up slightly in August, even without the 
refugee effect. On an average of the months from June to 
August, unemployment excluding refugees also remained 
largely unchanged, according to the Federal Employment 
Agency. See Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit  (2022), 
p. 13.

Statutory health  
insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) achieved a close- to- 
balance result in the second quarter of 2022. 
This was a clear improvement on the previous 
year: in the second quarter of 2021, the SHI 
scheme recorded a deficit of €2½ billion. The 
more favourable result is mainly due to add -
itional central government funds. These are in -
tended to largely offset the mainly structural 
funding gap in order to stabilise the additional 
contribution rates. In 2021, reserves covered 
the remaining funding gap.
Revenue rose sharply by 10% on the year, 
mainly owing to higher central government 
payments. Central government provided a sup -
plementary grant of €3½ billion. On top of 
this, the health fund received more money for 
its pandemic- related special expenditure from 
central government. Contribution receipts in -
creased by 4½%. Average supplementary con -
tribution rates – which were up slightly by 
0.1 percentage point – contributed only mar -
ginally to this.
SHI scheme expenditure rose by 6½%. The 
health fund incurred €7 billion for pandemic-  
related benefits. This was €1½ billion more on 
the year. In addition to coronavirus tests for the 
general public (€3½ billion), the fund paid for 
financial assistance to hospitals (€2½ billion) 
and vaccine costs (€1 billion). Expenditure on 
benefits by health insurance institutions climbed 
by 4½%. Spending on hospital treatment, a 
particularly large expenditure item, rose by 
4%.7 Growth in pharmaceuticals remained 
strong (+7%). Expenditure on remedies and 
therapeutic appliances as well as medical treat -
ments increased somewhat more strongly than 
expenditure on benefits. Administrative ex -
penditure grew by just under 4%.For 2022 as a whole, the conclusions of the 
group of SHI estimators in the fourth quarter of 
2021 suggested the SHI scheme would see a 
deficit of €2 billion. This was to arise in the 
health fund and be financed from its reserves.

to increase by 4½%. If the additional contribu -SHI in Q2: result

tion rates and the regular central government 
grant had remained unchanged, this would 
have resulted in an additional funding gap of 
€14 billion. Central government was to close 
this by means of an additional grant of the cor -
responding amount.
As things stand today, the outturn for the SHI 
scheme could be significantly more favourable 
and a marked surplus could emerge. To date, 
contribution receipts have grown much more 
strongly than expected by the group of estima -
tors. Furthermore, the actual average supple -
mentary contribution rate is just under 0.1 per -
centage point higher than anticipated. Uncer -
tainties related to the Ukraine war are unlikely 
to have much impact on SHI finances. In the 
event of higher unemployment or short- time 
work, the Federal Employment Agency contrib -
utes to compensatory benefits. These largely 
make up for shortfalls in employees’ contribu -
tions. The development of expenditure on 
benefits has so far been in line with the esti -
mate in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The underlying funding pressure for the statu -
tory health insurance scheme will not diminish 
next year. In the last few years, central govern -
ment legislators significantly expanded bene -
fits, irrespective of the pandemic. So far, the 
health insurance institutions have financed this 
mainly from their reserves and special grants 
from central government. This has resulted, 
however, in a large structural funding gap. 
Central government intends to close this gap 
next year mainly by taking temporary measures 
once again, planning an additional grant of €2 
billion and a loan of €1 billion by 2026. Any SHI 
reserves still available according to the govern -
ment estimate (around €7 billion in total) are to 
be dissolved. In addition, there will be a mix of 
savings on the benefits side, especially in the 
pharmaceuticals sector. Separately, central gov -
ernment expects a 0.3 percentage point higher 
additional contribution rate (corresponding to 
additional revenue of €4½ billion). However, it 
will not be until October that the group of 
statutory health insurance estimators will de -termine the relevant funding gap, from which 
the Ministry of Health will ultimately derive the 
necessary increase in the supplementary contri -
bution rate. However, the government’s choice 
to mainly use temporary measures merely 
delays fundamentally necessary action. With -
out a major reform which also dampens ex -
penditure growth, significantly higher add -
itional contribution rates are set to continue 
from 2024 onwards.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
posted a surplus of €½ billion in its core budget 
in the second quarter of 2022.8 At the same 
time last year, it had posted a deficit of €½ bil -
lion. This improved result is mainly due to add -
itional central government funds. Moreover, 
pandemic- related expenditure was lower than 
a year ago.
Revenue saw a very steep rise of 18½%. Since 
the beginning of the year, the long- term care 
insurance scheme has been receiving a regular

ing from the most recent expansion of benefits. 
Originally, the grant was to be paid in four 
equal instalments. In the second quarter, how -
ever, central government brought payments 
forward from the second half of the year, the 
upshot being that the long- term care insurance 
scheme has already received the full grant. In 
addition, there was a special grant of just over 
€1 billion for pandemic- related special burdens 
in order to avoid a further increase in the gen -
eral contribution rate. At the beginning of the 
year, benefit reforms meant the contribution 
rate for childless persons rose by 0.1 percent -… but as things

age point to 3.4%. Excluding the higher central 
government funds and the rise in the contribu -
tion rate, revenue grew by just under 4%. Em -
ployees’ contributions in particular rose sharply.
Expenditure grew by 9½%. Pandemic- related 
special payments to long- term care institutions 
and for coronavirus tests9 fell by 15% to €1½ 
billion. Other expenditure, however, grew 
much more strongly. This was due to an excep -
tionally sharp rise in spending on inpatient care 
(+25%). A strong rise was part of the plan: 
since the beginning of the year, the long- term 
care insurance scheme has been taking on a 
greater share of the costs as the length of time 
spent by care recipients in long- term care 
homes increases.10 Additional expenditure of 
€2½ billion was planned for this purpose. 
However, the results for the first half of the 
year point to a markedly higher burden. Cash 
benefits continued to grow strongly by 8%, 
with benefit rates unchanged.
Overall, the long- term care insurance scheme 
could well end up in deficit this year. This def -
icit could be as high as in 2021 (€1½ billion). A 
higher deficit was anticipated for a time, given 
the stronger than expected growth in expend -
iture on benefits. However, central government 
will grant a loan of €1 billion in the third quar -
ter that is not due for repayment until the end 
of 2023. Contribution receipts are also likely to 
continue to grow significantly. This counteracts 
the higher than expected increase in expend -
iture. Coronavirus- related special expenditure 
expired in the middle of the year and, after de -
ducting compensatory payments, cost €1 bil -
lion.
While this means a significant burden is lifted 
next year, the remaining financing gap, the 
redemp tion payments to central government 
and the reduced reserves are likely to require a 
higher contribution rate.Strong rise in

for coronavirus testing costs (€½ billion). In addition, it 
paid financial compensation to institutions for other

Securities markets
Bond market
At €148.7 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in July 2022 was higher than in 
June (€137.2 billion). After taking account of in -
creased redemptions and changes in issuers’ 
holdings of their own debt securities, the out -
standing volume of domestic bonds declined 
by €13.0 billion, following net issuance of 
€12.7 billion in June. Foreign debt securities 
worth €10.9 billion were redeemed in the Ger -
man market, which meant that the outstand -
ing volume of domestic and foreign debt in -
struments in Germany declined by €23.9 billion 
on balance.
The public sector redeemed its own bonds in 
the amount of €17.0 billion net in the reporting 
month. Central government, in particular, re -
duced its debt in net terms (-€10.6 billion). On 
balance, it primarily redeemed ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds: -€17.4 billion), while issuing 
two- year Treasury notes (Schätze) and five- year 
Federal notes (Bobls) worth a net €5.2 billion 
and €2.9 billion, respectively. State and local 
governments redeemed bonds with a net value 
of €6.5 billion.
German credit institutions scaled back their 
capital market debt by €7.0 billion net in July. 
On balance, redemptions primarily involved 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions (-€7.0 billion), but also involved public 
Pfandbriefe (-€2.4 billion). At the same time, 
the outstanding volume of other bank debt 
securities that can be structured flexibly and 
mortgage Pfandbriefe increased by €1.3 billion 
and €1.1 billion, respectively.
Domestic enterprises placed debt securities 
worth €11.0 billion net in the market in the 
month under review. This was entirely attribut -
able to other financial intermediaries, which 
primarily issued paper with a maturity of over 
one year.
In July, domestic credit institutions were the 
only actors on the buyers’ side. They acquired 
bonds worth €10.7 billion net, with interest 
focused  solely on domestic securities. The Bun -
desbank pared back its bond portfolio by €13.7 
billion on balance. Foreign investors, mean -
while, sold German debt securities for €11.0 
billion net. Domestic non- banks also sold bonds 
worth €9.9 billion, the majority of which were 
foreign paper.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €1.4 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign shares in the German market 
shrank by €3.3 billion over the same period. 
Domestic non- banks were dominant on the 
buyers’ side of the market, adding shares worth 
€1.9 billion net to their portfolios. By contrast,

investors sold bonds worth €2.1 billion net and 
€1.8 billion net, respectively.
Mutual funds
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded inflows 
of €2.8 billion. On balance, these funds were 
channelled exclusively into specialised funds 
(€3.8 billion) reserved for institutional investors. 
Among the asset classes, the chief beneficiaries 
of the new funds were open- end real estate 
funds (€1.8 billion) and mixed securities funds 
(€1.7 billion). Foreign mutual funds recorded 
outflows totalling €1.5 billion in the German 
market. On balance, domestic non- banks were 
the main purchasers of mutual fund shares in 
the month under review (€1.9 billion). Domes -
tic credit institutions purchased mutual fund 
shares for €1.2 billion net, while foreign invest -
ors reduced their fund portfolio in Germany by 
€1.8 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account posted a surplus of 
€5.0 billion in July 2022, down €9.3 billion on 
the previous month’s level. This was primarily 
caused by the shift into a deficit in invisible 
current  transactions, which comprise services 
as well as primary and secondary income. There 
was also a smaller surplus in goods trading.
In July, the surplus in the goods account de -
clined by €3.1 billion on the month to €8.3 bil -
lion because receipts recorded a sharper de -
crease than expenditure.
Invisible current transactions shifted from a sur -
plus of €2.9 billion in June into a deficit of €3.3 
billion in the reporting month, largely because 
the deficit in the services account expanded by 
€3.9 billion to €7.4 billion. Telecommunica -
tions, computer and information services and 
other business services made a considerable 
contribution to the lower overall receipts. In 
addition, expenditure rose, also due to higher Muted inflows

expenditure on transport services and charges 
for the use of intellectual property. On top of 
this, net receipts in primary income dropped by 
€1.3 billion to €10.7 billion. Although expend -
iture fell, receipts decreased more sharply. 
Lower payments to residents of dividends for 
portfolio investment and income on investment 
fund shares as well as from direct investment 
played a role in this. In the secondary income 
account, the deficit grew by €1.1 billion to €6.7 
billion. In this case, too, payments from abroad, 
in particular, fell compared with the previous 
month, mainly as a result of lower general gov -
ernment revenue from current taxes on income 
and wealth.
In July 2022, the financial markets were charac -
terised by high inflation rates, with the eco -
nomic outlook deteriorating at the same time. 
Germany’s cross- border portfolio investment 
generated net capital imports of €1.9 billion 
(June: net capital exports of €2.0 billion). Do -
mestic investors sold foreign securities worth 
€16.5 billion net. On balance, they parted with 
securities in all asset classes, i.e. bonds (€9.3 
billion), shares (€4.0 billion), money market 
paper (€1.6 billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€1.5 billion). For their part, non- resident in -
vestors reduced their holdings of German 
securities (€14.6 billion). These, too, covered all 
asset classes. Specifically, non- residents sold 
German money market paper (€5.8 billion), 
bonds (€5.2 billion), shares and mutual fund 
shares (€1.8 billion each).
In July, transactions in financial derivatives re -
corded outflows (€3.4 billion).
Direct investment recorded net capital exports 
of €13.8 billion in July (June: €11.2 billion). The main reason for this was that foreign com -
panies reduced their direct investment in Ger -
many by €14.1 billion, scaling back their equity 
capital by €2.2 billion. In addition, they re -
duced the volume of intra- group loans granted 
to business units in Germany by €11.9 billion. 
Conversely, German enterprises withdrew €0.3 
billion worth of direct investment funds from 
abroad. Although they raised their equity cap -
ital by €4.5 billion, intra- group lending was 
dominated by repayments (€4.9 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital imports amounting to €35.8 billion in 
July (following net capital exports of €29.8 bil -
lion in June). The Bundesbank’s net external 
claims went down by €36.6 billion, chiefly due 
to the decrease in TARGET2 claims (€50.4 bil -
lion). At the same time, however, the Bundes -
bank’s external liabilities also declined as resi -
dents from other euro area countries withdrew 
their deposits with the Bundesbank and liabil -
ities from the distribution of euro banknotes in 
circulation within the Eurosystem shrank as 
well. Monetary financial institutions (excluding 
the Bundesbank) recorded net capital exports 
(€6.5 billion). General government likewise re -
corded outflows of funds (€0.8 billion). By con -
trast, transactions by enterprises and house -

Negative interest rate policy period and 
pandemic as reflected in the Bank Lending 
Survey
The Eurosystem’s Bank Lending Survey (BLS) is a key source of information for assessing banks’ 
lending policies and developments in loan demand. BLS data on loan supply and demand pro -
vide a snapshot of the financing situation for non- financial corporations and households in both 
Germany and the euro area. Ad hoc questions, furthermore, are a way of quickly evaluating the 
impact of monetary policy measures on the financing situation and of thus gaining timely feed -
back on key questions for monetary policy transmission.
This article illustrates the role played by the BLS from 2014 to the present day, a horizon that 
covers the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) period, the coronavirus pandemic and, more 
recently, the high inflation rates and Russia’s attack on Ukraine. During this very challenging 
period, the BLS has, for example, provided information on how the monetary policy measures 
during the NIRP period had a supportive effect on banks’ lending policies. It has shown that the 
increased credit risk during the pandemic led to banks tightening their lending policies. BLS data 
provided insights into how it was possible to moderate these tightenings by means of accommo -
dative monetary policy measures and what effects the government support for corporate finan -
cing had during the pandemic- induced lockdowns. More recently, the BLS has given indications 
of how the high inflation and Russia’s war on Ukraine have changed loan supply and demand. 
These and other insights from the BLS served as key inputs in the ECB Governing Council’s mon -
etary policy decision- making process and in the economic policy debate at the national level.
Looking ahead, findings from the BLS will continue to make an important contribution to monet -
ary policy design in a setting of persistently disrupted supply chains and highly elevated inflation 
rates. One important question for monetary policymakers is how the banks will respond to the 
increase in credit risk brought about by the war against Ukraine and its extensive macroeconomic 
fallout, while the effects of the normalisation of monetary policy will also be of particular interest.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The last decade represented a very challenging 
period for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy. 
The spell of low inflation saw a very significant 
lowering of monetary policy interest rates 
– even into negative territory in the case of the 
deposit facility rate – and the ECB Governing 
Council took a raft of non-  standard monetary 
policy measures. Further monetary policy chal -
lenges have materialised recently in the shape 
of the pandemic, Russia’s war on Ukraine and 
the high levels of inflation. During these 
periods, it was crucial from a monetary policy 
perspective that the financing of the private 
non- financial sector should remain secure and 
that monetary policy transmission should not 
be disrupted by funding obstacles. A material 
role in the ongoing monitoring and assessment 
of the financing situation was played by the 
Euro system’s BLS.
The BLS has proven to be a valuable tool for as -
sessing, in a timely manner, banks’ lending pol -
icies and the developments in loan demand in 
Germany and the euro area. The interplay be -
tween loan supply and demand, as indicated 
by BLS data, provides a snapshot of the finan -
cing situation in both the euro area and Ger -
many. Ad hoc questions, furthermore, are a 
way of quickly evaluating the impact of monet -
ary policy measures on the financing situation, 
say, and of thus gaining timely feedback on key 
questions for monetary policy transmission.
The BLS regularly gives information on develop -
ments in loan demand in the previous quarter 
and provides an outlook for expected demand 
in the next three months. The factors for loan 
demand surveyed in the BLS shed light on the 
purpose of and forces driving loan demand, 
and can be interpreted to understand how 
monetary policy has affected loan demand, for 
example. Other key information includes, for 
instance, whether enterprises are primarily 
looking to finance fixed investment, how im -
portant the current interest rate level is for de -
mand developments, and whether it is mainly liquidity bottlenecks that need to be bridged in 
crisis situations.
The BLS focuses mainly on banks’ lending pol -
icies, however. Banks surveyed under the BLS 
are also asked to report on current changes to 
their lending policies, adjustments they are 
planning for the near future, and the various 
reasons for adjustments. Banks’ plans to adjust 
their lending policies have proven to be a good 
leading indicator for explaining later develop -
ments. A tightening of lending policies – such 
as during the financial crisis – can be explained 
either by bank- side factors, i.e. constraints on 
banks’ balance sheets or their financing, or the 
reason may lie with the borrowers – a tighten -
ing of policies may be triggered, for example, 
by increased credit risk resulting from a deteri -
oration in the macroeconomic situation. In -
creasing competition in the banking sector, 
meanwhile, can have an easing effect on lend -
ing policies.
Ad hoc questions in the BLS provide timely in -
dications of how individual monetary policy 
measures are reflected in banks’ lending pol -
icies and whether they affect loan volumes. 
They are also used to collect information on 
how the measures affect banks’ profitability 
and financing situations. The BLS thus plays a 
crucial role in identifying isolated effects of 
various monetary policy measures on individual 
indicators. BLS data can also feed into an over -
all assessment of the desired effects of monet -
ary policy measures in conjunction with any 
side effects.
This article outlines how BLS data on loan de -
mand, lending policies, the impact of monetary 
policy measures and banks’ financing situations 
have evolved since 2014 in Germany and the 
euro area.1 It begins by looking at the NIRP

ning of 2020 as a subset of the NIRP period. 
The third period under observation begins with 
the war against Ukraine in the first quarter of 
2022 and extends up to the present day.
BLS banks’ lending policies were characterised 
by easing measures during the NIRP period up 
to the onset of the pandemic, as demand for 
bank loans steadily increased. BLS data indicate 
that banks’ financing conditions improved, 
partly as a result of monetary policy measures 
taken to tackle the too- low inflation rate. At 
the same time, however, the negative interest 
rate on the deposit facility and the Eurosys -
tem’s expanded asset purchase programme 
(APP) each had a negative impact on balance 
on banks’ profitability, according to BLS data. 
Taken in isolation, the pandemic then led to 
banks tightening their lending policies in re -
sponse to the increased credit risk. This coin -
cided with a sharp uptick in demand for bank 
loans. Government- guaranteed loans and mon -
etary policy measures succeeded in mitigating 
the tense financing situation for enterprises. 
This period saw banks make broad use of the 
third series of targeted longer- term refinancing 
operations (TLTRO  III) as a low-  cost source of 
funding. Against the backdrop of the war 
against Ukraine and increased macroeconomic 
risks, the BLS data show that the period of 
tightening lending policies that began during 
the pandemic continued. Given the high infla -
tion rates, it is currently in the interest of mon -
etary policy for lending policies to be tight -
ened.
NIRP period up to the onset 
of the pandemic
The NIRP period in the euro area began in June 
2014 when the interest rate on the deposit fa -
cility was lowered into negative territory. In an 
effort to return inflation from a very low level 
to rates below, but close to, 2% in the medium 
term,2 the ECB Governing Council took a raft of 
accommodative measures, implementing re -
ductions in key interest rates, new refinancing operations (TLTROs) and purchase programmes 
to ease monetary and financial conditions3 and 
enhance the functioning of the monetary pol -
icy transmission mechanism.4 By including ad 
hoc questions in the BLS, it was possible to as -
sess, in a timely manner, how each of the Euro -
system’s non- standard measures were affect -
ing lending.
Three series of TLTROs have been conducted 
since 2014.5 These measures were intended to 
stimulate bank lending to non- financial corpor -
ations and households (excluding loans for 
house purchase) in order to invigorate demand 
and thus bolster inflation. Before these oper -
ations were implemented, the BLS was show -
ing that lending policies had been tightened 
and loan demand in the euro area as a whole 
had fallen during the European sovereign debt 
crisis. The TLTROs offered the banks favourable 
financing conditions plus a set of incentives

Conducting and evaluating the Bank Lending Survey
The Bank Lending Survey (BLS) aims to pro-
vide a more comprehensive understanding 
of the monetary policy transmission process 
via the banking sector, thereby supporting 
monetary policy decisions. At present, 33 
banks in Germany and a total of 153 euro 
area banks participate in the survey, which 
the Eurosystem has conducted in the euro 
area since 2003. The samples are represen-
tative.1 The survey regularly asks high- level 
representatives of participating banks for 
up- to- date information on their lending 
policies and for an assessment of institution- 
specifi  c credit demand. For lending policy, a 
distinction is made between credit stand-
ards as the minimum requirement for loan 
approval and the credit terms and condi-
tions as laid down in the loan contract. In 
addition, BLS banks provide information on 
the factors they believe are driving develop-
ments in credit demand and lending policy. 
All data are collected separately for loans to 
enterprises2 and loans to households. Loans 
to enterprises are broken down by enter-
prise size, while loans to households are 
split into loans to households for house 
purchase and consumer credit and other 
lending.3 Participant banks are asked, fi  rst, 
about the developments they have seen 
over the past three months and, second, 
about the changes they expect to take 
place over the next three months. In add-
ition to the regular questionnaire, ad hoc 
questions are also used to gather assess-
ments of non- standard monetary policy 
measures or special topics with short- term 
relevance, for example.
Current lending policy and demand are as-
sessed – as is the case, in principle, for all 
other questions – as quarterly changes (ex-
cluding seasonal fl  uctuations in demand). 
Here, fi  ve possible responses4 are given in 
the form of trend statements. In all  euro area countries, the individual responses 
given by the banks participating in the sur-
vey are aggregated on a question- by- 
question basis to national results.5 Net per-
centages6 are calculated for each question 
in the regular questionnaire. The survey re-
1 The banks in the German sample are mapped to the 
following banking groups: big banks, regional banks, 
Landesbanken, savings banks, credit cooperatives, pri-
vate mortgage banks and banks with special, develop-
ment and other central support tasks. To obtain an ap-
proximately representative sample of the German 
banking sector as a whole, the share of the banks in 
the sample for each banking group is based on the 
banking group’s respective share in the German bank-
ing sector’s overall lending volume.
2 Enterprises are understood to be non- fi  nancial cor-
porations for the purposes of the BLS.
3 According to the compilation guide that accompan-
ies the BLS questionnaire, this category includes not 
only traditional loans granted for personal consump-
tion but also overdrafts and credit card loans as well as 
loans to sole proprietors and partnerships (not quasi- 
corporations) and to non- profi  t institutions serving 
households.
4 For supply- related questions, the scale comprises the 
following possible answers: “tightened considerably”, 
“tightened somewhat”, “remained basically un-
changed”, “eased somewhat” and “eased consider-
ably”. For demand- related questions, the range com-
prises “increased considerably”, “increased some-
what”, “remained basically unchanged”, “decreased 
somewhat” and “decreased considerably”.
5 When aggregating responses at the national level, 
the data of all banks in a country’s sample are 
weighted equally. Two countries additionally calculate 
aggregates by weighting banks’ responses with their 
respective share of the loan portfolio of the country in 
question.
6 For supply- related questions, the net percentage re-
fers to the difference between the sum of the percent-
ages for “tightened considerably” and “tightened 
somewhat” and the sum of the percentages for “eased 
somewhat” and “eased considerably” (as a percentage 
of responses given). Positive net percentages thus indi-
cate tightened standards, while negative values indi-
cate a loosening of standards. For demand- related 
questions, the net percentage refers to the difference 
between the sum of the percentages for “increased 
considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum 
of the percentages for “decreased somewhat” and 
“decreased considerably”. Positive net percentages 
thus indicate increased demand, while negative values 
indicate decreased demand. In addition to net per-
centages, averages for responses across all banks and 
diffusion indices are also calculated. The latter are cal-
culated much like net percentages, the difference 
being that the “somewhat” answers are only given a 
weight of 0.5.Deutsche Bundesbank

sults for Germany are regularly published 
and analysed by the Bundesbank. For the 
ad hoc questions, too, net percentages are 
calculated and published wherever pos-
sible, or alternative aggregation measures 
are applied on a question- by- question basis. 
Data provided by all participating euro area 
institutions are included in the euro area 
aggregate calculated by the European Cen-
tral Bank (ECB).7
The standard questionnaire was revised and 
expanded again in 2022 following a major 
reform in 2015.8 Extensions to the question-
naire must always be carefully considered, 
as potential information gains from a more 
nuanced line of questioning invariably entail 
greater effort on the part of the respondent 
banks. This time around, the changes pri-
marily consisted of a more comprehensive 
survey of explanatory factors, the aim of 
which is to yield valuable additional infor-
mation for monetary policy makers.
– For loans to enterprises, the question on 
explanatory factors is broken down fur-
ther for credit terms and conditions as a 
whole as well as for lending margins as a 
constituent part of these from the April 
2022 survey round onwards (reference 
period: Q1 2022). As was already the 
case for credit standards for loans to en-
terprises, the factors consist of four 
headings under which the respective 
sub- factors are summarised: fi  rst, “Cost 
of funds and balance sheet constraints”, 
broken down into “Your bank’s capital 
and the costs related to your bank’s cap-
ital position”, “Your bank’s ability to ac-
cess market fi  nancing (e.g. money or 
bond market fi  nancing, incl. true- sale 
securitisation” and “Your bank’s liquidity 
position”; second, “Pressure from com-
petition”, subdivided into “Competition 
from other banks”, “Competition from 
non- banks” and “Competition from mar-
ket fi  nancing”; third, “Perception of risk”, split into “General economic situation 
and outlook”, “Industry or fi  rm- specifi  c 
situation and outlook/ borrower’s credit-
worthiness” and “Risk related to the col-
lateral demanded”; and fourth, “Your 
bank’s risk tolerance”.
– For the credit standards on loans to 
households for house purchase as well 
as consumer credit and other lending, 
this more detailed breakdown has also 
been introduced for the previously ag-
gregated factor “Cost of funds and bal-
ance sheet constraints” from the April 
2022 survey round onwards.
– Since this round, factors infl  uencing the 
development of demand for loans to en-
terprises have additionally been sorted 
by enterprise size.
– Also since the April 2022 round, changes 
in the rejection rate of enterprises’ loan 
applications have been broken down by 
enterprise size. As already explained in 
the compilation guide,9 it is now also ex-
plicitly stated in the question that the re-
sponse should cover both formal and in-
formal loan applications.

cluding the ad hoc questions of the given

Loan demand
In keeping with monetary policymakers’ inten -
tions, the historically low level of interest rates 
supported demand for bank loans, as indicated 
in the balance sheet statistics data (see the 
above chart) and in the results of the BLS (see 
the chart on p. 24). Banks’ assessments of de -
velopments in demand as part of the BLS can 
indicate how loans actually evolve in a particu -
lar quarter before the data from the balance 
sheet statistics become available. This is be -
cause BLS data are already available at the be -
ginning of the following quarter, while balance 
sheet statistics data are only normally published 
around four weeks after the end of the re -
spective reporting month.
According to the BLS, demand for bank loans 
in Germany, and also in the euro area as a 
whole, increased almost without interruption 
during the NIRP period up to the onset of the pandemic.8 Enterprises were mainly interested 
in taking out long- dated9 loans as a way of 
locking in the low interest rates for the long 
term. These funds were channelled primarily 
into fixed investment, which is a form of invest -
ment that normally takes place when the econ -
omy is in good shape. Rising fixed investment 
helped shore up inflation, as intended by the 
ECB Governing Council. BLS responses showed 
that bank loan demand was being dampened, 
however, by firms tapping their internal finan -
cing options, which were broader on account 
of the generally upbeat state of the economy.
Similarly, households in Germany and the euro 
area as a whole also took advantage of the 
negative interest rate environment to take out 
more bank loans. The surveyed banks mainly 
put this down to the low level of interest rates 
as well as increased consumer confidence. Bor -
rowers’ assessment that prospects were good 
in the housing market also drove demand for 
loans for house purchase to a considerable ex -
tent. Demand for consumer credit and other 
lending is also likely to have been supported by 
the positive economic developments and the 
good outlook in the labour market over this 
period. Above all, consumers spent more 
money on durable consumer goods than be -
fore. By contrast, household demand among 
the surveyed banks was dampened by house -
holds’ use of their own savings. The surveyed 
banks in Germany reported a temporary damp -
ening of demand for loans for house purchase 
in 2016. This was because the German Act Im -

8 The BLS compilation guide explains that, for the purposes 
of the BLS, demand refers to nominal gross demand com -
pared with the previous quarter, apart from normal sea -
sonal fluctuations. It refers to the bank loan financing need 
of enterprises and households, independent of whether 
this need will result in a loan or not. Loan requests made in 
parallel with multiple BLS institutions may significantly in -
crease loan demand as recorded in the BLS and thus over -
state actual demand developments. Information on the 
reasons given for changes in loan demand is fraught with 
uncertainty because bank managers can only indirectly as -
sess the key reasons for borrowers’ decisions.

Ad hoc questions in the Bank Lending Survey
In addition to the regular standard ques-
tions, the Bank Lending Survey question-
naire contains a number of ad hoc ques-
tions that are used to obtain timely infor-
mation on current issues relevant to monet-
ary policy. The content and frequency of the 
ad hoc questions can be adjusted as re-
quired. In recent years, for example, ques-
tions have been asked on topics such as 
banks’ fi  nancing situations, non- standard 
monetary policy measures, the effects of 
non- performing loans on lending policies, 
and government- guaranteed assistance 
loans during the coronavirus pandemic. At 
present, seven sets of questions are asked 
alternately on a quarterly, semi- annual or 
annual basis. The responses to the ad hoc 
questions provide the Eurosystem with in-
formation at points in time for which there 
are not yet suffi   cient data available from other sources to allow for a more in- depth 
empirical analysis.

ten) entered into force in March 2016, which 
led some of the potential borrowers to refrain 
from making loan requests owing to banks’ 
higher requirements.
Lending policies
Credit standards are the key indicator for the 
lending behaviour of the banks surveyed under 
the BLS. These are the bank-  specific minimum 
requirements potential borrowers need to meet 
in order to be granted a loan.10 The BLS banks 
furthermore provide information on the terms 
and conditions of the loan actually approved as 
laid down in the loan contract. These generally 
consist of the agreed spread over the relevant 
reference interest rate (margin), the size of the 
loan, the access conditions and other terms 
and conditions in the form of non- interest rate 
charges (i.e. fees), collateral or guarantees which 
the respective borrower needs to provide (in -
cluding compensating balances), loan coven -
ants and the agreed loan maturity. There is no 
summary measure for the respective level of 
credit standards and credit terms and condi -
tions. The BLS addresses this challenge by sur -
veying quarter- on- quarter changes in lending 
policy. To compare levels at different points in 
time, the changes can be summed up (cumu -
lated)11 over a longer period of time. Develop -
ments in credit standards – and also in BLS de -
mand – are of particular relevance to monetary 
policy, as they are a leading indicator for the 
future  path of loans.12
Having massively tightened their credit stand -
ards following the onset of the financial crisis in 
2007, the institutions surveyed under the BLS 
then adjusted them only moderately over sev -
eral years (see the chart on p. 26). During the 
NIRP period, the credit standards for loans to 
enterprises and for consumer credit and other 
lending to households were then repeatedly 
eased slightly until the end of 2018. These ad -
justments were consistent with the aim of the accommodative monetary policy, which was to 
increase inflation by stimulating consumption 
and credit growth. The favourable financing 
situation for enterprises and households con -
tributed to a steady increase in loan demand, 
according to BLS banks’ assessment. The BLS 
banks in the euro area as a whole eased their 
lending policies more significantly than those in 
Germany. Banks in the euro area thus reversed 
some of the tightening that had been ongoing 
until 2014, while German banks had not tight -
ened their credit standards during this period. 
Survey participants mainly put their easing 
down to the tense competitive situation with 
rival institutions from the banking and non-  
banking sectors (see the chart on p.  27). In 
addition, the BLS banks in the euro area expli -
citly reported that the APP was having an ex -
pansionary effect on their credit standards for 
loans to enterprises and on their loan vol -
umes13 (see the chart on p. 38). Moreover, the 
banks participating in the TLTROs in Germany 
and in the euro area alike reported that they 
had used the funds primarily for lending to en -
terprises and households, consistent with the 
monetary policy purpose of the measure. This Credit standards

policy 
Credit standards 
eased more 
strongly in euro 
area than in 
Germany during 
the NIRP period10 Credit standards are established prior to the actual loan 
negotiation on the terms and conditions and the actual 
loan approval/ rejection decision. They define the types of 
loan a bank considers desirable and undesirable, the desig -
nated sectoral or geographic priorities, the collateral 
deemed acceptable and unacceptable, etc. Credit stand -
ards specify the required borrower characteristics (e.g. bal -
ance sheet conditions, income situation, age, employment 
status) under which a loan can be obtained.
11 This method does, however, have some weaknesses 
and should therefore only be regarded as a rough measure. 
The level of credit standards prevailing when the survey 
was launched in 2003 is unknown. Ideally, cumulation 
should be measured against a benchmark with a “neutral” 
level which, however, it is impossible to identify. Compari -
sons between individual banks or credit segments are out 
of the question since it cannot be assumed that the re -
spective starting levels were identical. Between 2014 and 
2019, one ad hoc question was asked each year on the 
current level of credit standards relative to certain periods 
in the past. However, this question was removed again be -
cause it became increasingly difficult over time to assess 
the level. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2014) for a discussion 
of the cumulation method and a presentation of the results 
of the ad hoc question on the level of credit standards.
12 See the box on the BLS’s role as a lead of lending on 
pp. 28 ff.

suggests that the TLTROs, too, have had a 
volume- enhancing effect, even if the banks re -
ported that the TLTRO funds had often been 
used to replace other sources of funding.14 The 
BLS has thus provided timely indications that 
the monetary policy measures had a desired 
accommo dative effect on the financing condi -
tions of enterprises and households.
A regulatory one- off effect meant that in Ger -
many, unlike in the euro area as a whole, the 
competition- induced period of easing credit 
standards for loans for house purchase did not 
set in until 2017. As a result of the implementa -
tion of the Mortgage Credit Directive into Ger -man law, 2016 saw a large proportion of the 
German institutions surveyed under the BLS 
tighten their credit standards over multiple 
quarters. The surveyed institutions reported that 
the provisions under this legislation increased

ments for loans granted for house purchase.15 0+100+200+300+400+500+600+700Cumulative changes in credit standards since the start of the BLS

The Bank Lending Survey as a lead of lending
In the Bank Lending Survey (BLS), banks are 
asked about any changes in the credit 
standards they use for lending as well as 
their assessment of changes in loan de-
mand. Both of these questions relate to the 
BLS reference period of the three months 
preceding the survey and can therefore be 
used for explaining lending during this time 
frame. In addition, the reported changes 
can also act as a lead of future loan devel-
opments. For example, in response to an 
easing of credit standards, it is likely that 
more loans will also be granted in the sub-
sequent months and quarters, all other 
things being equal. Early information on fu-
ture loan developments is, in turn, of great 
interest for monetary policy, for instance in 
the context of economic forecasting. Thus, 
on the basis of the time series available 
from 2003 onwards, this box conducts a 
statistical analysis for Germany and the euro 
area to determine whether the data on 
changes in credit standards and loan de-
mand collected by the BLS are a systematic 
lead of changes in the aggregate loan vol-
ume.Quarterly BLS data and the MFI balance 
sheet statistics for the period from the fi  rst 
quarter of 2003 to the fi  rst quarter of 2022 
are used for the analysis. In order to take 
account of the infl  uence of both loan sup-
ply and loan demand, the BLS data are used 
to construct a combined “BLS lending indi-
cator” that describes net changes in the 
credit environment. This is represented by 
the sum of the net share of banks reporting 
an easing of their credit standards1 and the 
net share of banks reporting a rise in loan 
demand. A positive value of the indicator 
signals an improvement in the credit envir-
onment, whilst a negative value signals a 
deterioration. Based on this calculation 
method, the lending indicator’s informative 
content with regard to actual loan growth 
is examined here. The quarterly growth 
rate2 of the loan volume according to the 
balance sheet statistics –  for the market 
segments of loans to non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations and loans for house purchase, re-
spectively – is used as the measure of loan 
growth.
A fi  rst measure of a potential leading indi-
cator property is the cross- correlation, i.e. a 
simple correlation coeffi   cient between the 
BLS lending indicator for a given quarter 
and the loan growth of a previous quarter 
(negative time interval in quarters) or a sub-
sequent quarter (positive time interval in 
quarters). For the segment of loans to 
enter prises, the resulting series of cross- 
1 The variable “change in credit standards” typically 
measures the net share of banks reporting a tightening 
of their lending policies. It is therefore factored into 
this calculation with its sign reversed.
2 For the purpose of this analysis, the difference be-
tween the logarithmic index of transaction- based 
changes (index of notional stocks) and its value from 
the previous quarter is used, as this approximates the 
rate of loan growth.Cross-correlation* between BLS lending

correlations, with time intervals varying 
from -8 to +8 quarters, exhibits an S- shaped 
curve for both Germany and the euro area 
(see the chart on p. 28): an improvement in 
the credit environment during the reference 
quarter subsequently results in a higher rate 
of growth (positive correlation for positive 
time intervals in quarters). In line with the 
cyclical pattern of economic developments, 
and thus also of lending, an above- average 
rate of loan growth is followed by a deteri-
oration in the credit environment after a 
certain period of time (negative correlation 
for negative time intervals in quarters).3
This means that there is evidence that the 
BLS lending indicator is both a lead and a 
lag of loan growth. The BLS data thus re-
fl  ect, at least in part, cyclical developments 
in lending, which can also be gleaned from 
the data on loan growth themselves. How-
ever, as the information from the BLS is al-
ready available a few weeks before publica-
tion of the latest data on loan volumes for 
the respective quarter, the BLS lending indi-
cator may be used as a lead of current loan 
growth in any case.
In order to determine whether the BLS lend-
ing indicator has any informative content of its own beyond the information that can be 
obtained from loan growth itself, a further 
analytical step is needed. This step ascer-
tains the leading indicator property of the 
BLS lending indicator based on its ability 
to predict future loan growth. The concept 
of “Granger causality” is used for this pur-
pose.4 One variable “Granger- causes” an-
other if it has statistically signifi  cant predict-
ive ability for the subsequent values of this 
target variable even after controlling for the 
target variable’s lagged infl  uence on itself. 
In this case analysed here, the BLS lending 
indicator would have Granger causality for 
loan growth if its present value were correl-
ated with future values of loan growth even 
once the correlation of loan growth with it-
self over time had been factored out. The 
Granger causality concept is used, in par-
ticular, in what is known as the vector au-
toregressive (VAR) model framework. This is 
a system of equations in which each ob-
served variable is determined simultan-
eously by lags of all these variables and one 
random error for each. The parameters of 
this model can be estimated using statistical 
3 This cycle continues accordingly, with deteriorations 
in the credit environment subsequently being followed 
by lower growth rates again, etc.

methods (least squares method). Provided 
that the number of lags has been deter-
mined correctly, the model describes all cor-
relation relationships between all of the 
variables involved at any given point in 
time. From the estimated VAR model, it is 
possible to calculate what are known as 
impulse- response functions. These depict 
the isolated relationship between a change 
in one of the variables and the subsequent 
values of all variables. In addition to the fact 
that it is thus possible to adjust the cross- 
correlation between the variables, the esti-
mated model also allows conclusions to be 
made regarding the statistical signifi  cance 
of any potential leading indicator property.
For both Germany and the euro area, it is 
confi  rmed that the BLS lending indicator is 
a lead. For Germany, the estimated impulse- 
response function shows that loan growth 
exhibits a statistically signifi  cant response to 
a rise in the lending indicator, in that it is 
higher over a period of around two to 
seven quarters compared with a scenario in 
which the lending indicator does not 
change (see the chart on p. 29). By contrast, 
the lending indicator does not respond sig-
nifi  cantly to an increase in loan growth. For 
the euro area, the lending indicator is a statistically signifi  cant lead of loan growth 
over a period of zero to seven quarters (see 
the chart on p. 29). After a short positive ef-
fect, the lending indicator shows a statistic-
ally signifi  cant negative response to a rise in 
loan growth after fi  ve to seven quarters. 
This means that the cyclical pattern in the 
cross- correlation between the two variables 
is demonstrated for the euro area in this an-
alysis, too. However, the response of the 
lending indicator is somewhat weaker than 
that of loan growth. Furthermore, the busi-
ness cycle is not the sole determinant of the 
response of loan growth to the lending in-
dicator. This is also supported by extended 
model specifi  cations (not shown here), 
which exclude the infl  uence of cyclical fac-
tors and continue to demonstrate that the 
BLS lending indicator is a lead.
In the segment of loans for house purchase, 
the cross- correlation coeffi   cients for Ger-
many show a weak development overall, 
even when they are positive at positive time 
intervals in quarters for loan growth relative 
to the BLS lending indicator (see the adja-
cent chart). For the euro area, the S- shaped 
curve is more pronounced and is similar to 
that of the correlation coeffi   cients for loans 
to enterprises.
On the basis of a VAR model for the growth 
of housing loans and the associated BLS 
lending indicator, it is revealed that the lead 
of BLS information for Germany is statistic-
ally signifi  cant (at the 5% level) only for a 
very short period of up to one quarter (see 
the chart on p.  31). However, the confi  -
dence interval is very close to the zero line. 
The opposite response of the lending indi-
cator is likewise very short- lived. For time 
intervals greater than or equal to one quar-
ter, it is virtually zero. For the euro area, the 
lead of the lending indicator is more pro-
nounced and, up to a period of ten quar-
ters, is statistically signifi  cant above zero Cross-correlation* between BLS lending

(see the above chart). By contrast, the op-
posite response of the lending indicator to 
a rise in loan growth is only signifi  cant at 
the time when the change occurs, but does 
not persist beyond that.
The results show that the lending indicators 
constructed from the BLS data on credit 
standards and loan demand are leads of 
loan growth in the respective market seg-
ments. More in- depth analyses, which are 
not presented here for reasons of space, 
suggest that the leading indicator proper-
ties differ across market segments: in the 
case of loans to enterprises, the lead is 
driven mainly by the BLS credit standards; in 
the case of loans for house purchase, the 
infl  uence of the BLS loan demand predom-
inates. However, owing to the purely statis-
tical nature of the analyses carried out here, 
these results do not yet allow any conclu-
sions to be drawn regarding the signifi  -
cance of loan supply and loan demand for 
aggregate lending in each credit segment. 
In order to make such an assessment, fur-
ther analyses within the framework of a 
structural model are required.Impulse-response functions* for the growth in loans for house purchase and for the BLS

When economic activity weakened as of 2019, 
Germany and the euro area as a whole saw the 
first instances of credit standards being tight -
ened, above all for loans to enterprises. In add -
ition to the general economic situation, sector 
and firm- specific factors played a part in the 
surveyed institutions assessing that credit risk 
had risen and increasing the requirements for 
borrowers. Responses to the BLS indicate that 
this period also saw an increase in the share16 
of rejected informal loan requests and formal 
loan applications from both enterprises and 
households.
The accommodative effect that monetary pol -
icy had on banks’ lending policies was also re -
flected in credit terms and conditions, with 
margins being narrowed in all the loan seg -
ments surveyed under the BLS in the NIRP 
period up to the onset of the pandemic (see 
the chart on p. 34). For the purposes of the 
BLS, the loan margin is understood to mean 
the spread that a bank includes in the lending 
rate over a relevant market reference rate.17 
The margin can either be adjusted actively by 
the banks changing the lending rate, or it can 
change passively, i.e. without any adjustments 
on the part of the banks, as a result of moves 
in the market reference rate. Banks saw reason 
to actively narrow their margins at the start of 
the NIRP period given the tense competitive 
situation in both the German and the euro 
area- wide banking sector. Credit institutions in 
the euro area sample reported furthermore 
that both the TLTROs and the APP had exerted 
an easing effect on their credit terms and con -
ditions, especially at the beginning of the NIRP 
period. They noted that the negative interest 
rate on the deposit facility had also had an eas -
ing effect, resulting in lending rates being 
lowered and margins narrowed. Banks reduced 
their margins more for average loans than for 
riskier loans. By narrowing their margins pre -
dominantly in lower- risk business, it seems that 
banks were looking to expand their lending 
without, if possible, increasing the average 
probability of default in their credit portfolio.This information from the BLS provided indica -
tions that the monetary policy measures were 
having the desired effect. The mounting pres -
sure on banks’ interest rate margins gave them 
an incentive to increase lending as a way of 
offsetting this pressure.18 In corporate lending 
business, the NIRP period saw not only margins 
but also the other terms and conditions be -
come more customer- friendly. Credit institu -
tions made concessions to their customers 
mainly in terms of the agreed covenants, but 
also with regard to non- interest rate charges, 
loan amounts and maturities, and the required 
collateral. The year 2019 then saw margins 
widening for the first time, even though the 
lending rates for loans to enterprises and to 
households for house purchase were still on 
the decline. Banks attributed this to changes in 
the cost of funds and/ or balance sheet con -
straints. One reason for this (predominantly 
passive) widening of margins could have been 
the non- standard monetary policy measures, 
which lowered banks’ funding costs (see the 
section below on the financing situation). At 
the same time, the market reference rates 
(money market rate) fell as well, faster than 
lending rates. In this way, the margin may have 
widened temporarily.
This passive widening of margins is one ex -
ample of how the monetary policy interest rate 
cuts and non- standard measures had an impact 
on banks’ profitability. In this context there 
were both positive and negative effects on 
earnings (see the charts on pp. 38 ff.). The dif -
ferentiated responses regarding the effects on 
earnings are a prime indication that banks’ re -
sponse behaviour in the BLS is not essentially 
interest- driven. According to the BLS data, 
banks participated in the TLTROs primarily be -
cause of the attractive conditions. Both the 
participating German institutions and the banks NIRP period

17 The relevant market reference rate depends on the 
characteristics of the loan in question. Depending on the 
loan’s maturity, the market reference rate could be EURIBOR, 
LIBOR or €STR or, for fixed rate loans, the interest rate 
swap of a corresponding maturity.

in the euro area as a whole reported a positive 
impact on their profitability, as the preferential 
conditions of the TLTROs relieved the burden 
on their interest expenditure. However, unlike 
the euro area banks, the German sample 
showed greater interest only as of the second 
series of TLTROs, which had more attractive 
conditions than the first. At that time, the al -
ready prolonged period of negative interest 
rates exerted increasing pressure on banks’ net 
interest margin. The APP also contributed to 
this pressure. Since the ad hoc question on this 
subject was introduced, the German BLS banks 
have reported on a broad basis that the pres -
sure on their net interest margin has had a 
negative impact on their profitability. In 2015 
the surveyed banks in the euro area as a whole 
still reported, on balance, that the APP had had 
a neutral impact on their profitability overall. 
This was because the negative effect on their 
net interest margins was offset by capital gains 
resulting from price gains on bonds. However, 
according to BLS data, the negative impact of 
the APP on banks’ profitability subsequently 
outweighed the positive effects in an increas -
ing number of euro area countries. According 
to the surveyed banks19 in Germany and in the 
euro area as a whole, the negative deposit fa -
cility rate also contributed significantly to a de -
cline in their net interest income. Until the start 
of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, 
just under 90% of BLS banks in Germany and 
70% of banks in the euro area sample reported 
slight or significant negative effects on balance. 
By contrast, the two- tier system for remunerat -
ing excess liquidity holdings had a positive im -
pact on earnings. This had been adopted by 
the ECB Governing Council in September 2019 
to support the bank- based transmission of mon -
etary policy.20 Under the two- tier system, a por -
tion of banks’ excess liquidity was exempted from 
negative interest rates as of October 2019.21
All in all, the BLS data on loan supply and de -
mand developments provide no indications 
that lending was constrained in the euro area 
or in Germany during the NIRP period prior to 
the pandemic. While banks did report a steady increase in demand for loans, they also cited 
fiercer competition, which contributed to the 
easing of lending policies.
Banks’ financing situation
Banks in both Germany and the euro area as a 
whole reported an improvement in their finan -
cing terms and conditions, especially in the first 
two years of the NIRP period (see the chart on 
p. 40).22 Access to short- term customer deposits 
improved in particular, while access to longer-  
term deposits deteriorated.23 This is likely to be 
connected to the fact that the narrow interest 
rate spread between the two deposit categor -
ies increasingly reduced the incentive for cus -
tomers to invest their savings over longer 
periods. According to BLS data, market access 
for medium to long- term debt securities be -
came easier. Data on current bond yields con -
firm this assessment. The TLTROs and the APP 
also contributed to improving the market finan -
cing conditions and strengthening the liquidity 
position at BLS institutions in the German and 
euro area samples (see the chart on p. 38). This 
is because the participating banks were able to 
finance themselves more cheaply via the 
TLTROs than in the market. Banks were also 
able to secure liquidity by selling bonds to the 
central bank under the APP . The APP also had a

20 See European Central Bank (2019b).
21 Since the fourth quarter of 2019/ first quarter of 2020, 
banks are to take into account the net impact of the effects 
of the negative deposit rate, including the two- tier system, 
while also assessing the effects of the two- tier system in 
isolation.
22 Questions are asked about the following credit categor -
ies: retail funding (short- term deposits up to one year, 
long- term deposits over one year including other retail 
funding instruments), interbank unsecured money market 
(very short- term money market up to one week, short- term 
money market over one week), wholesale debt securities 
(short- term as well as medium to long- term debt secur -
ities), securitisation (of loans to enterprises and loans for 
house purchase), and the ability to transfer credit risk off 
the balance sheet.
23 The reported volumes in the balance sheet statistics 
confirm this. According to this, sight deposits were built up 
during this period, while the volume of savings and time

Pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic caused a historic de -
cline in global economic output, including in 
Germany and the euro area. Economic activity 
also dwindled as a result of measures taken by 
public authorities, enterprises and consumers 
in Germany and abroad to contain the pan -
demic.25 This situation caused supply chains 
around the world to stall. Amid an inflation rate that was still too low, monetary policy -
makers were now focused on the risk of finan -
cial system disruptions and temporary funding 
shortages for enterprises and households.26 In 
order to support further the provision of credit 
to households and firms with favourable finan -
cing terms and conditions in the face of eco -
nomic disruption and heightened uncertainty27 
thereby avoiding further downward pressure 
on inflation from the financing side, the ECB

policy measures.28 The terms of TLTRO III were 
made considerably more attractive,29 with par -
ticipating banks being able to secure an inter -
est rate on borrowed funds of as low as -1% 
over a period of two years, provided that they 
met certain lending requirements.30 Further -
more, temporary purchases under the pan -
demic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) 
were made between March 2020 and March 
2022 alongside the APP .31 At the same time, 
additional longer- term refinancing operations 
(LTROs) were conducted temporarily to provide 
immediate liquidity support to the euro area 
financial system. Moreover, at the beginning of 
the pandemic, government guarantees were 
introduced in many euro area countries, espe -
cially for new loans to enterprises.32
As a result, according to BLS data there were 
no broad- based supply- side restrictions on 
lending during the pandemic. Sectors particu -
larly hard hit by the pandemic where banks be -
lieved credit risk to be significantly raised were 
largely able to obtain liquidity through 
government- guaranteed assistance loans. Ac -
cording to the BLS, the expansionary monetary 
policy measures during the pandemic also 
played a key role in providing the real economy 
with favourable financing opportunities.
Loan demand
According to BLS data, the high liquidity needs 
initially led to a sharp rise in demand for bank 
loans to enterprises in both Germany and the 
euro area as a whole at the beginning of the 
pandemic (see the chart on p. 24). This demand 
came primarily from small and medium- sized 
enterprises.33 Especially in the first year of the 
pandemic, enterprises needed significant bridg -
ing loans, which banks reported in the BLS 
under the heading “inventories and working 
capital”. According to the responses to an ad 
hoc question in the BLS, enterprises covered 
acute liquidity needs for the most part with 
government- guaranteed loans, which they also 
used to build up precautionary liquidity buffers. The BLS indicated that these loans recorded a 
strong increase in the first half of 2020. During 
this period, demand growth in Germany for 
loans without government guarantees was sig -
nificantly lower. According to BLS data, de -
mand in the euro area for loans without gov -
ernment guarantees actually declined. Enter -
prises also used bank loans for refinancing, 
debt restructuring and renegotiation purposes. 
In some cases, existing loans were replaced 
with government- guaranteed loans. According 
to the BLS, uncertainty about the future course 
of the pandemic led to a scaling back of fixed 
investment as well as mergers, acquisitions and 
restructuring, which, all other things being 
equal, dampened loan demand.
In the second half of 2020, BLS data show that 
the demand for loans to enterprises declined 
overall in the euro area. Unlike in Germany, 
where the need for bank loans, mainly to 
bridge financing bottlenecks, continued to in -
crease in a weakened form, the need for loans 
in the euro area fell primarily due to a scaling 
back of fixed investment. According to BLS 
data, during the remainder of the pandemic 
demand for government- guaranteed loans ini -
tially declined in Germany and, from 2021, also 
in the euro area. In the second year of the pan -
demic, the need for funds for fixed investment 
gradually rebounded. Banks’ expectations for 
the respective following quarter revealed con -
siderable uncertainty during this period, as de -
mand in the BLS was regularly expected to be 
higher than it subsequently turned out to be. It 
appears that, at the beginning of the pan -No broad- based

demic, enterprises increased liquidity buffers to 
such an extent that their demand for bank 
loans increased only relatively sluggishly in 
2021.
Household demand for loans in both Germany 
and the euro area moved in the opposite direc -
tion to that of enterprises. In the second quar -
ter of 2020, demand for loans for house pur -
chase as well as for consumer credit and other 
lending declined significantly, which the sur -
veyed BLS banks attributed to a collapse in 
consumer confidence. In many cases, durable 
consumer goods were no longer purchased be -
cause retail outlets were largely closed on ac -
count of the lockdown. Demand for loans for 
house purchase rebounded as of the third 
quarter of 2020. Despite the pandemic, bor -
rowers’ perceptions of the housing market out -
look remained favourable and thus, just like the 
low general level of interest rates, buoyed loan 
demand. Demand for loans for house pur -
chases was dampened by the use of savings in 
the acquisition of real estate. In the case of 
consumer credit and other lending, the second 
lockdown at the beginning of 2021 had a simi -
lar impact to the first, with demand for loans 
collapsing again after having stabilised some -
what for a while. Demand did not recover on a 
lasting basis until the second quarter of 2021 
amid subsiding infection rates and the easing 
of containment measures. According to BLS 
data, the propensity to purchase and consumer 
confidence rebounded.
Lending policies
The first pandemic year of 2020 was character -
ised in the euro area and in Germany by re -
strictive adjustments to lending policies in all 
lines of business covered by the BLS (see the 
chart on p. 27). However, the cumulated changes 
in credit standards show that these tightening 
measures fell well short of those during the 
financial crisis of 2008-09 (see the chart on 
p. 26). The financial crisis had emerged from 
the financial system itself and had severely im -paired banks’ supply of credit. In the BLS, this 
was evidenced at the time by the high import -
ance attributed to bank- side factors in explain -
ing the changes in credit standards. By con -
trast, the BLS has shown that the impact of the 
pandemic took place primarily via increased 
borrower-  side risks. For loans to enterprises, 
the surveyed institutions tightened their credit 
standards in particular for loans to sectors that 
were especially affected by the pandemic con -
tainment measures. In 2020, these included, in 
particular, the wholesale and retail trade, the 
services sector, manufacturing and commercial 
real estate.34 The restrictive impact of the gen -
eral economic situation and the economic out -
look, which in 2020 had initially also been a 
factor in the tightening, quickly receded as a 
result of government support measures during 
the pandemic.
In the case of loans issued with government 
guarantees during the pandemic, the govern -
ment assumed a large part of the credit risk as -
sociated with lending for the banks. It thus 
shielded banks from credit risk, which had risen 
sharply, especially in sectors particularly af -
fected by the pandemic. Accordingly, the BLS 
showed that the surveyed banks eased their 
credit standards for loans with COVID-  19- related 
government guarantees in the first half of 2020 
compared with the second half of 2019, before 
such pandemic-  related assistance loans had 
been introduced (see the chart on p.  37). 
On  balance , euro area banks also eased the 
credit terms and conditions for government-  
guaranteed loans to enterprises, especially in 
the first year of the pandemic. By contrast, the 
banks in the German sample barely adjusted 
the credit terms and conditions for these loans. 
The easing of the credit standards for guaran -
teed loans continued in a weakened form until 
mid- 2021. By contrast, the BLS banks reported 
that the standards and terms and conditions 
for loans without government guarantees were Demand for

tightened in both Germany and the euro area. 
This was broadly in line with the data provided 
by banks on overall lending policy, which cover 
all new lending.
As intended by monetary policymakers, the 
negative interest rates and non- standard mon -
etary policy measures had an expansionary ef -
fect on lending policies during the pandemic 
and helped to provide the real economy with 
favourable sources of funding (see the chart on 
p. 38). On balance, the TLTROs and the purchase 
programmes including the PEPP continued to 
have an easing effect on credit standards at 
banks in the euro area sample, but not in the 
German one. However, as a result of participa -
tion in the TLTRO III, German banks did ease 
their credit terms and conditions and expand 
their lending, especially to enterprises at which 
the operations were principally aimed. The APP 
and the PEPP also continued to have an easing 
impact on credit terms and conditions and loan 
volumes in the euro area sample, while once 
again, this effect failed to materialise in the 
German sample. The negative deposit facility 
rate, including the two- tier system, continued 
to contribute to the decline in lending rates, 
though to a somewhat lesser extent as of 2021, 
according to the banks. This suggests that the 
effect on lending rates of the last cut in the de -
posit facility rate of 18 September 2019 grad -ually dissipated. Lending rates nevertheless 
subsequently reached new historical lows.35
Banks in Germany, as in the euro area, also 
tightened their credit standards for loans to 
households at the beginning of the coronavirus 
pandemic. The share of rejected loan applica -
tions increased markedly. The tightening was 
justified by the banks mainly on the grounds of 
the deteriorating outlook for the economy, but 
also due to the uncertain housing market situ -
ation and the reduced creditworthiness of 
many potential borrowers. Credit terms and 
conditions were also made more restrictive. For 
loans for house purchase, banks restricted the 
loan- to- value ratio more sharply than before, 
and for consumer credit and other lending they 
mainly restricted the loan amounts. From the 
end of 2020, no further significant tightening 
occurred in either of these credit segments. In 
the course of 2021, banks in Germany partially 
reversed the tightening of the standards and 
terms and conditions for consumer credit and 
other lending. In their assessment, the general 
economic situation improved again as a result Increased

of the pandemic- related restrictions gradually 
ending. In the euro area, by contrast, banks 
largely retained their stricter lending policy.
The economic turmoil triggered by the pan -
demic and heightened uncertainty prompted 
the ECB Governing Council to make TLTRO III 
considerably more attractive. According to BLS 
data, TLTRO III led to a significant improvement 
in banks’ profitability. The participation rate in 
TLTRO III among BLS banks rose sharply in June 
2020 to over 70%. According to BLS banks in 
Germany and the euro area, they participated 
mainly because of the favourable conditions. 
As part of these operations, banks were able to 
obtain liquidity for three years at very favour -
able conditions. At the same time, the banks 
reported that the APP and the PEPP , when 
viewed in isolation, continued to exert pressure 
on the net interest margin and net interest in -
come36 (see the charts on pp. 38 f.). However, 
as the APP and the PEPP again enabled the sur -
veyed euro area banks to make capital gains during the pandemic, the negative impact of 
the programmes on profitability declined some -
what during this period. On balance, this was 
not the case for German institutions, meaning 
that their profitability, when viewed in isol -
ation, was still significantly affected by the APP 
according to the BLS. There is empirical evi -
dence that the APP led banks in euro area 
countries with higher risk premia to tend to in -
vest more in riskier securities.37 Yields on these 
securities are likely to have fallen comparatively 
more sharply in the wake of the APP , thus con -
tributing to a shift in banks’ portfolios towards 
riskier assets. The dampening impact of the 
negative deposit facility rate on banks’ net 
interest income decreased somewhat as a re -
sult of the introduction of the two- tier system, 
particularly in the euro area sample, but also in 
the case of banks in Germany. However, this Continued

impact remained relevant for around half of 
the euro area banks surveyed. This, too, had a 
negative effect on institutions’ profitability.38
Banks’ financing situation
With the pandemic and the high degree of un -
certainty about its economic impact, banks in 
Germany and the euro area initially made 
gloomier assessments of their financing situ -
ation (see the chart above). According to BLS 
data, the issuance of debt securities became 
more difficult, especially in the medium to 
longer- term segment. Yields rose significantly. According to BLS data, access to securitisation 
and the ability to transfer credit risk off the bal -
ance sheet also deteriorated. However, banks 
reported that access to customer deposits re -
mained good during the first phase of the pan -
demic. From the second half of 2020 onwards, 
the situation generally eased again and, ac -
cording to BLS data, there were improvements 
in relation to all sources of funding surveyed.
According to BLS data, the non- standard mon -
etary policy measures contributed to the easing 
of banks’ financing situation (see the chart on 
p. 38). As of the fourth operation in June 2020, 
financing via TLTRO III became significantly 
cheaper than market financing. As more BLS 
banks both in Germany and the euro area then 
participated in the operations, more institutions 
also reported that their financial situation, in 
particular their liquidity position, improved as a 
result of their participation. The APP’s positive 
impact on banks’ financing conditions and 
liquidity position, which had waned over time 
until the second quarter of 2020, also intensi -
fied temporarily. In addition, the two- tier sys -
tem for negative interest in the deposit facility 
likewise contributed somewhat to the improve -
ment in the liquidity position.
War on Ukraine
Since the start of the Ukraine war in February 
2022, the prices of many commodities, and es -
pecially energy, have risen steeply, driving con -
sumer prices in the euro area up sharply. The 
ongoing disruptions to international supply 
chains were another contributory factor.39 As a 
result, the rate of inflation has risen noticeably, 
and inflationary pressures have intensified 
across many sectors. The Governing Council of 
the ECB therefore decided in June 2022 that

cluded as of 1 July 2022.40 Net purchases under 
the PEPP had been discontinued back on 
31 March 2022, as planned.41 This paved the 
way for the first policy rate hike since 2011, in 
line with the previously communicated timeline 
for monetary policy normalisation.42 On 21 July 
2022, the Governing Council of the ECB de -
cided to raise key interest rates by 50 basis 
points in response to the updated assessment 
of inflation risks. It also approved the Transmis -
sion Protection Instrument (TPI), which is in -
tended to support the effective transmission of 
monetary policy.43 As the inflation rate re -
mained significantly too high and is expected 
to remain above the target for an extended 
period of time, the Governing Council decided 
to raise the key interest rates by a further 75 
basis points on 8 September 2022. Over the 
next several meetings, the Governing Council 
said it expected to raise interest rates further. It 
also decided to suspend the two- tier system for 
the remuneration of excess reserves. The Gov -
erning Council intends to continue reinvesting 
the principal payments from maturing secur -
ities purchased under the APP and the PEPP . It 
will ensure that the phasing out of TLTROs III 
does not hamper the smooth transmission of 
monetary policy.44
Loan demand
According to BLS data, demand for loans to 
enterprises in Germany picked up more strongly 
again in the first half of 2022 (see the chart on 
p. 24). In the euro area, it had already risen fairly 
strongly in the fourth quarter of 2021, meaning 
that the increase in demand did not accelerate 
any further there. Higher demand was driven 
mainly by the increased need for funding for 
inventories and working capital. Many enter -
prises have probably expanded their inventories 
in the face of unstable supply chains and the 
heightened uncertainty as a result of the war 
on Ukraine. Demand for funding for fixed in -
vestment, too, continued to increase in the first 
quarter, which was reflected in higher demand 
for long- term loans. However, increasing un -certainty meant that the fixed investment fac -
tor had a dampening effect on demand for 
loans to enterprises again in the second quarter 
of 2022, much like at the beginning of the pan -
demic. Looking to the third quarter, banks in 
Germany and the euro area as a whole are not 
expecting demand to rise any further.
Demand for loans for house purchase increased 
significantly more strongly in Germany in the 
first quarter of 2022 than banks had expected. 
Because the Governing Council of the ECB an -
nounced in December 2021 that net purchases 
under the PEPP would be discontinued in 
March 2022,45 rising interest rates were ex -
pected. This could have triggered anticipatory 
effects among borrowers. In the euro area, 
too, demand for loans for house purchase ini -
tially continued to expand. In the second quar -
ter of 2022, it then dropped again for the first 
time since the start of the pandemic. Banks at -
tributed this mainly to lower consumer confi -
dence. In line with the monetary policy object -
ive of price stability, the recent significant in -
crease in the general interest rate level, espe -
cially in the longer- term segment, no longer 
drove up demand. However, this factor had no 
significant impact on demand for consumer 
credit and other lending, which continued to 
expand throughout the first half of 2022. For 
the third quarter, banks in Germany and the 
euro area expect a slump in demand for loans 
to households for house purchase and a much 
smaller increase in demand for consumer credit 
and other lending.

ple tightened their credit standards for loans to 
enterprises only marginally in the first half of 
2022 (see the chart on p. 27). As banks had not 
notably eased credit standards following the 
tightening at the start of the pandemic, stand -
ards were probably already comparatively tight 
when the war on Ukraine broke out. Banks also 
made credit terms and conditions somewhat 
more restrictive. By contrast, lending policies 
were tightened significantly in the euro area in 
the second quarter of 2022. In both Germany 
and the euro area, banks justified the recent 
tightening with their view that credit risk has 
risen.
For the third quarter, banks in both samples are 
planning to tighten their credit standards fur -
ther. In the past, banks’ plans to adjust their 
credit standards in the following quarter have 
proved to be a good indicator of what has ac -
tually happened. This is true of Germany and 
the euro area and applies to all credit seg -
ments. With the inflation rate high, monetary 
policy’s intention is certainly for lending policies 
to be tightened. According to the surveyed BLS 
banks in the euro area and in Germany, the ex -
pansionary effects of non-  standard monetary 
policy measures on their lending policy and 
loan volume are likely to become ever smaller. 
In fact, euro area banks for the first time actu -
ally expect the purchase programmes to have 
restrictive effects on credit standards and terms 
and conditions for loans to enterprises and on 
the terms and conditions for consumer credit 
and other lending.
In the first two quarters of 2022, the banks sur -
veyed in Germany and the euro area as a whole 
also set stricter standards for loans for house 
purchase. In the second quarter of 2022, credit 
standards in Germany were tightened more 
than ever before since the introduction of the 
BLS in 2003. In this credit segment, too, the 
tightening seen during the pandemic had been 
reversed only marginally in the meantime. The 
share of rejected loan applications rose consid -
erably in both Germany and the euro area as a 
whole. According to the banks, all three factors which contribute to their risk assessment ac -
cording to the BLS questionnaire had a restrict -
ive impact: the general economic situation and 
outlook, housing market prospects and bor -
rowers’ creditworthiness. For the third quarter, 
banks in both Germany and the euro area are 
planning to further tighten their credit stand -
ards. Credit standards for consumer credit and 
other lending were also tightened in the second 
quarter, something that is likely to continue in 
the coming quarter.
The discontinuation of net purchases under the 
PEPP and the APP and the gradual phasing- out 
of the TLTROs are also reducing the impact of 
these measures on banks’ profitability. This is 
likewise reflected in banks’ responses in the 
BLS. Banks participating in the TLTROs continue 
to benefit from the favourable interest rate on 
the funds raised. However, the third series 
ended with the allocation of the tenth oper -
ation in December 2021, meaning that repay -
ments are gradually due and the amount of 
outstanding funds is coming down. On the 
other hand, the surveyed banks also said in the 
April round46 that they expected the negative 
impact of the purchase programmes and the 
negative deposit rate on their profitability to 
wane in the second and third quarters of 2022. 
One factor here is likely to have been that a 
first interest rate hike was expected in July.
Banks’ financing situation
Since the outbreak of the war on Ukraine in the 
first quarter of 2022, euro area banks, in par -
ticular, describe their financing situation as hav -
ing deteriorated (see the chart on p. 40). By 
contrast, the situation in Germany has clouded 
over much less thus far. According to BLS data,

come more difficult, especially in the medium Further tighten -

to longer- term segment, but so has access to 
the short- term money market. Since the begin -
ning of 2022, data on bond yields and money 
market rates have shown a clearly upward 
trend. This is because the sharp rise in the rate 
of inflation and the incipient monetary policy 
normalisation have led to expectations of inter -
est rate increases, causing the general interest 
rate level to rise in anticipation. According to 
BLS data, access to securitisation and the abil -
ity to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet 
also declined. However, according to the 
banks, access to customer deposits remained 
broadly unchanged. Looking to the third quar -
ter, euro area banks expect a continued deteri -
oration in their access to market funding.
In the April round, banks said that they ex -
pected the effects of TLTROs and the APP to 
weaken their market financing conditions and 
liquidity position during the second and third 
quarters of 2022. In the euro area, the sur -
veyed banks even for the first time expected 
the APP to have a negative impact on their 
liquidity position and financing conditions in 
the second and third quarters of the year. This 
assessment by banks is likely related, first, to 
the discontinuation of net asset purchases 
under the PEPP in March 2022. Second, the 
surveyed banks are likely to have anticipated in 
the spring that the Eurosystem would gradually 
reduce its net purchases under the APP or dis -
continue them altogether. The reduction in the 
degree of expansiveness intended by monetary 
policymakers is therefore likely to be achieved 
with the expiry of the non- standard measures.
Conclusions
The Bank Lending Survey is the central source 
of information for assessing banks’ lending pol -
icies and demand for loans in Germany and the 
euro area. Its findings were valuable for monet -
ary policy decision- making, especially during 
the NIRP period and the pandemic. Its flexible 
design means that the BLS allows information to be obtained quickly in a rapidly changing en -
vironment.
The BLS does not suggest that lending was re -
stricted during the NIRP period before the pan -
demic. While banks reported a steady increase 
in demand for loans they also described fiercer 
competition, which, like monetary policy meas -
ures, contributed to the easing of lending pol -
icies. During the pandemic, there were likewise 
no broad- based supply- side restrictions on 
lending. Sectors particularly hard hit by the 
pandemic where banks believed credit risk to 
be significantly raised were largely able to ob -
tain liquidity through government-  guaranteed 
assistance loans. Furthermore, the negative 
interest rates and non- standard monetary pol -
icy measures had an expansionary effect on 
lending policies during the pandemic – as in -
tended – and helped to provide the real econ -
omy with favourable sources of funding.
In addition, the information obtained from ad 
hoc questions in the BLS helps to answer ques -
tions relevant to monetary policy transmission. 
It was thus possible to gauge the impact of 
non- standard monetary policy measures using 
banks’ responses before enough statistical data 
were available for a more in- depth empirical 
analysis. For instance, banks’ responses suggest 
that the negative effects of the APP and the 
negative deposit rate on profitability did not re -
sult in a curb on lending. On the contrary, the 
results of the BLS indicate that these measures 
had an expansionary impact on loan volume in 
the euro area as a whole, as intended by mon -
etary policy. During the NIRP period, the Gov -
erning Council of the ECB implemented far-  
reaching measures to combat inflation, which 
was too low during this period. Reports from 
the participating institutions suggest that 
TLTRO III operations, in particular, in which Ger -
man banks also participated actively during the 
pandemic, are likely to have brought about an 
expansion in lending. At the same time, banks 
participated in these operations primarily be -
cause they were profitable.The impact of

Even in the current macroeconomic situation, 
which is characterised by much uncertainty, the 
BLS helps to identify the challenges in terms of 
the supply of loans in a timely manner. One im -
portant question for monetary policymakers is, 
for instance, how banks will respond to the in -
crease in credit risk brought about by the war 
against Ukraine and its extensive macroeco -
nomic fallout. The effects of monetary policy 
normalisation are also of central interest. The 
exit from non- standard monetary policy meas -
ures and rising monetary policy interest rates will have an impact on banks’ financing condi -
tions. With inflation rates high, a contraction -
ary effect on lending policy is currently desir -
able from a monetary policy perspective. Timely 
information from the BLS on how the financing 
situation is developing is of particular signifi -
cance in this situation. As the BLS data on 
credit standards and demand for loans are a 
leading indicator of future developments in 
lending, this information can help to identify 
early on where potential difficulties could arise 
in providing the economy with credit.BLS data allow

Productivity effects of reallocation in the 
corporate sector during the COVID-  19 crisis
The COVID-  19 crisis had highly heterogeneous effects on economic sectors and firms in Germany. 
As a result, it may have increased the reallocation of jobs. This could reinforce productivity growth 
if employees increasingly moved from less productive firms to more efficient ones in the same or 
another sector.
With regard to shifts in employment weights between the various sectors of the German econ -
omy, there have been hardly any productivity- enhancing effects over the past two years. How -
ever, this does not mean that the reallocation of jobs between sectors was weak. Instead, there 
were reductions in employment not only in sectors with below- average productivity, such as 
accommodation and food service activities, but also in highly productive sectors, such as manu -
facturing. At the same time, in addition to the highly productive information and communication 
sector, sectors that are less productive in arithmetical terms, such as human health and social 
work activities, also saw sharp rises in employment.
Productivity growth nevertheless benefited from job fluctuations within sectors. This counteracted 
the sharp decline in aggregate productivity, but was only able to absorb it in part. This is consist -
ent with the fact that larger, and generally more productive, firms suffered smaller production 
losses than other firms as a result of the pandemic. Also for this reason, more productive firms 
hired considerably more new employees, or dismissed considerably fewer existing employees, 
over the course of 2020.
However, the estimated relationship between productivity and changes in employment at the firm 
level during the most recent recession was not especially pronounced in comparison with the pre- 
crisis period. Accordingly, there was no strengthening of the productivity- enhancing reallocation 
of jobs in Germany in 2020. By contrast, the number of business start- ups rose sharply last year, 
particularly in knowledge- intensive services sectors. This could bolster productivity growth over 
the medium term. This likewise holds true of the strong growth in corporate investment in hard -
ware and software prompted by the pandemic over the past two years.
Even though the effects of government support measures were not investigated explicitly, it can 
be assumed that they played a role in the moderate impact of job reallocation on productivity. 
On the one hand, these measures were successful in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 crisis  
on firms with sustainable business models as well as in preventing insolvencies. On the other 
hand, however, government assistance may have potentially prevented greater productivity-  
enhancing reallocation effects via the employment channel.Deutsche Bundesbank

Corporate fluctuations and 
productivity effects during 
the COVID-19 crisis
The coronavirus pandemic not only reduced 
economic activity, but also caused shifts in mar -
ket shares, employment, and medium- term 
earnings prospects between firms in Germany. 
Although extensive government support meas -
ures helped to mitigate the declines in firms’ 
turnover, the economy experienced a massive 
collapse in 2020. The magnitude of these eco -
nomic losses varied very considerably between 
different areas of the economy. This was evi -
dent, for example, in the dispersion of output 
growth across sectors and industries. This re -
flected the differences in how severely the vari -
ous segments of the corporate sector were im -
pacted by the diverse and, in some cases, 
sweeping restrictions and behavioural adjust -
ments affecting households and firms. For ex -
ample, economic activity in contact- intensive 
industries, in which working-  from- home solu -
tions or other physical distancing measures 
were difficult to implement, came almost to a 
complete standstill at times. This held especially 
true for accommodation and food service ac -
tivities, personal service activities and entertain -
ment, parts of the travel sector, as well as some 
segments of the stationary retail trade sector. 
By contrast, there were booms in industries such as online retail trade and shipping services 
as well as in the demand for certain IT services 
and pharmaceutical products. Moreover, the 
manufacturing sector was also hit hard by the 
COVID-  19 crisis. While production fell sharply 
at the beginning of the pandemic due to tem -
porary closures resulting from a lack of demand 
and intermediate input deliveries, it suffered 
from wide- ranging supply chain issues during 
the subsequent recovery.
In principle, firms that had already gone digital 
prior to the pandemic or that had larger finan -
cial buffers were better able to respond to the 
challenges presented by the pandemic. For this 
reason, too, the pandemic- related effects on 
firms – even on those from the same sector – 
were, in some cases, very heterogeneous. 
These changes triggered by the pandemic, 
which also emerged in many other countries, 
were sometimes referred to as a “reallocation 
shock”.1 In Germany, fluctuations in the cor -
porate sector had declined sharply over the 
past two decades. This concerned, in particular, 
the number of corporate insolvencies, business 
closures, and start- ups. The COVID-19 crisis 
may therefore have interrupted this trend.
The reallocation of economic resources and 
growth opportunities may have an impact on 
labour productivity in the corporate sector. If 
employment shares among firms shift from less 
efficient firms to more productive ones, this 
bolsters productivity growth.2 First, this process 
may occur amongst incumbents, both within 
and across sectors. Second, some firms exit the 
market, while new ones enter. Young and in -
novative firms typically see rapid growth, build 
up their staff, and can thus reinforce future 
productivity growth. By contrast, firms that are 
no longer profitable dismiss their workers, who Crisis affected

are then free to engage in more efficient activ -
ities with other firms.3
Recessions are usually associated with losses of 
jobs and income. However, in the sense of 
Schumpeterian “creative destruction”, the 
COVID-  19 crisis could have been a time of in -
creased productivity-  enhancing job realloca -
tion.4 In the literature, this is referred to as a 
“cleansing effect” triggered by recessions. 
However, a priori, it is unclear whether eco -
nomic crises actually reinforce the productivity- 
enhancing reallocation process.5 This is be -
cause, especially during recessions, reallocation 
can be disrupted by other factors, such as 
financial market friction or government inter -
vention.6 In addition, even productive firms 
may reduce job creation during economic cri -
ses, for instance if they take on a “wait- and- 
see” attitude.7 This article analyses the role of 
job reallocation for labour productivity growth 
in the German corporate sector since the 
coronavirus pandemic.8 Productivity effects re -
sulting from the reallocation of capital are not 
investigated here.
Labour productivity is calculated as the ratio of 
gross value added to labour input. Depending 
on how labour input is measured, labour prod -
uctivity has developed very differently over the 
past two years. In terms of hours worked, it 
grew by just under 1% in each of these years. If 
the number of employed persons is instead 
used to measure labour input, it decreased by 
around 3% in 2020 and increased by 2.5% in 
2021. The different results produced by these 
two measures are due to the extensive use of 
short- time working, which allowed firms to 
drastically cut back their working hours with -
out reducing their numbers of staff. Hourly 
productivity is considered to be the more 
accurate  measure for analysing productivity 
growth since it also factors in changes in aver -
age working hours. Nevertheless, in the follow -
ing, labour productivity refers to the number of 
employed persons. First, this ensures consist -
ency with the firm- level data used for analytical 
purposes, as these data typically contain infor -mation on employees and not hours worked. 
Second, changes in the number of employed 
persons are a better indicator of more persist -
ent adjustments in labour input.Cleansing effect

3 Furthermore, the pandemic affected innovation in certain 
business areas, for example in the medical and pharma -
ceuticals sector. This means that the productivity of incum -
bents may have also changed as a result of shifting profit 
opportunities.
4 See Schumpeter (1934).
5 For studies that find evidence of the cleansing effect of 
recessions, see, inter alia, Caballero and Hammour (1994), 
Foster et al. (2016) and Osotimehin and Pappadà (2017). 
Cleansing effects are not necessarily optimal for welfare, as 
they are usually accompanied by (temporary) unemploy -
ment and fluctuations in consumption.
6 See, inter alia, Barlevy (2003), Boeri and Bruecker (2011), 
Foster et al. (2016) and Kozeniauskas et al. (2022). This 
does not mean that support measures are fundamentally 
inefficient. For example, in a frictional market, measures 
such as short- time working can also enhance efficiency 
(see Giupponi and Landais (2019)). In this context, frictions 
in the labour market may be due to political factors (for ex -
ample, employment protection) or result from the structure 
of the market (for example, search frictions).
7 Recessions may therefore also have a dampening effect 
on productivity (see, inter alia, Caballero and Hammour 
(2005), Kehrig (2015) and Haltiwanger et al. (2021)). Fur -
thermore, recessions can have a lasting negative impact on 
productivity growth, for example if innovation activities are 
weakened during the recession (see, for example, Anzoat -
egui et al. (2019)).
8 Here, reallocation is determined by the changes in the 
number of employed persons in sectors, industries or firms. 
The reallocation of jobs therefore only accounts for filled 
positions and not vacant positions.Deutsche Bundesbank

Indicators of the reallocation 
of jobs
One fundamental question that arises here is 
whether the COVID-19 crisis was a reallocation 
shock in Germany, too. One reason to believe 
that this is not the case is that some indicators 
used to measure fluctuations in the corporate 
sector fell sharply, especially in the first year of 
the pandemic. This applies primarily to the 
number of corporate insolvencies and business 
closures.9 The number of start- ups initially 
dropped, too. Moreover, not only the number 
of jobs subject to social security contributions that started, but also those that had been ter -
minated, fell considerably. The reallocation of 
workers was therefore not particularly pro -
nounced in the first year of the pandemic.10 
Nevertheless, productivity- enhancing realloca -
tion effects arise when comparatively product -
ive industries or firms add jobs or less product -
ive industries or firms destroy jobs more sharply, 
thereby shifting employment weightings to -
wards more  productive activities. It is therefore 
particularly important to know whether firms, 
industries or sectors have added or destroyed 
jobs to varying degrees.
According to indicators on the dispersion of 
employment growth, the reallocation of jobs 
has increased significantly over the past two 
years, at least compared with previous years.11 
This applies both to the intersectoral dispersion 
of employment growth in Germany as a whole 
and to interindustry employment growth within 
individual sectors. Owing to the sharp decline 
in closures and the initially only moderate 
change in the number of start- ups, shifts be -
tween incumbents were the main reason for 
this. In this respect, the COVID-19 crisis did not 
trigger a comprehensive reallocation shock in 
the corporate sector in Germany, unlike else -

9 Data on start- ups and closures are based on the Federal 
Statistical Office’s business registration statistics. Corporate 
head offices with greater economic significance are con -
sidered here. These encompass undertakings managed or 
established by a legal person, partnership or natural per -
son. In the case of a natural person, this is predicated on 
them being (or having been) entered in the commercial 
register, having (had) an entry in a skilled trades register, or 
employing (or having employed) at least one person.
10 See also Schmidt (2021). The reallocation of workers 
also includes employees changing firms without jobs being 
either created or destroyed. These transfers can, in prin -
ciple, also be productivity- enhancing even without employ -
ment weightings being shifted because, for instance, the 
employees’ skill sets are a better fit to the new firms’ 
needs.
11 A comprehensive analysis of job reallocation requires 
extensive corporate data covering job creation and de -
struction by firms in all sectors; see, for example, Foster et 
al. (2016) and Bachmann et al. (2021). For reasons of data 
availability, this is not possible here.Deutsche Bundesbank

where.12 Nevertheless, the increase in the 
disper sion of employment growth across sec -
tors and industries shows the potential for 
productivity- enhancing reallocation effects dur -
ing the pandemic.
Impact of the reallocation of 
jobs between sectors
Sector labour productivity growth can be de -
composed into three components. The first is 
based on the shift of jobs between sectors with 
different levels of productivity, the second on 
reallocation between sectors with different 
rates of productivity growth, and the third on 
productivity growth that would result absent 
shifts in jobs across sectors. The first two com -
ponents can therefore be used to identify the 
productivity effect resulting from reallocation 
between 20 sectors which are distinguished in 
the national accounts.13 The reallocation level 
effect is positive if employment shifts from less 
productive to more productive sectors. How -
ever, this effect was basically zero in 2020 and 
2021. Moreover, hardly any changes can be 
seen in this component of productivity growth 
compared with the pre- crisis years of 2018 and 
2019.14 The reallocation growth effect, which 
measures the contribution to growth of shifts 
in employees between sectors with different 
productivity dynamics, likewise did not contrib -
ute to productivity growth during the pan -
demic. Overall, productivity growth has thus 
hardly increased in the past two years owing to 
job shifts towards more productive or dynamic 
sectors.
This finding may be surprising given the in -
creased employment shifts between sectors. It 
results from the fact that, during the pandemic, 
jobs were destroyed not only in sectors with 
below- average productivity, such as the accom -
modation and food service activities sector, but 
also in highly productive sectors, such as manu -
facturing. The percentage decline in employ -
ment in 2020 was significantly smaller in manu -
facturing than in the accommodation and food service activities sector. However, employment 
was reduced more strongly here in terms of the 
number of persons. At the same time, in add -
ition to the highly productive information and 
communication sector, less productive sectors 
in arithmetical terms, such as human health 
and social work activities, also saw sharp rises 
in employment.Sector shifts in

12 In Germany, the fluctuations in the dispersion measures 
were not exceptionally high by historical standards. The 
dispersion of sector employment growth was more pro -
nounced in the early 1990s. The dispersion of intrasectoral 
employment growth was likewise higher in the past. For 
studies that link a reallocation shock to the pandemic in the 
United States and the United Kingdom, see Anayi et al. 
(2021) and Barrero et al. (2021a).
13 The decomposition of growth follows the OECD’s 
standardised approach; see OECD (2018). In the literature, 
there are different methods of performing this type of de -
composition. The OECD approach corresponds to a firm-  
level growth decomposition. However, it can lead to distor -
tions caused by adding chained volume data. For an alter -
native approach, see, for example, Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2021a). This delivers overall similar results for the realloca -
tion effect over the past two years.
14 By contrast, calculations of hourly productivity indicate 
a significant, positive contribution of the reallocation level 
effect for 2020. This is likely to be due, amongst other 
things, to the fact that some sectors that were severely af -
fected by the pandemic and display a relatively low level of 
productivity saw an extremely sharp decline in hours 
worked. In the accommodation and food service activities 
sector, for example, the number of hours worked fell by 
around 23%, while the number of persons employed in the 
sector fell by 8%. In 2021, the reallocation level effect cal -
culated on an hourly basis roughly corresponds to the ef -
fect obtained for productivity measured in persons.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2022

According to the decomposition, labour prod -
uctivity growth in Germany during the pan -
demic was shaped by the contribution of the 
intrasectoral effect (the third component of the 
decomposition). Sector- specific developments 
are key to this component.15 These include 
changes in total factor productivity (TFP) or 
capital intensity in a given sector. In addition, 
job reallocation – namely between firms in the 
same sector – can also matter for this compon -
ent. This is plausible inasmuch as the fluctu -
ation of employees within sectors is associated 
with comparatively low frictions owing to 
industry- specific human capital, whilst at the 
same time the dispersion of productivity levels 
of firms even within narrowly defined industries 
is extremely high.16
Effects of the reallocation of 
jobs within sectors
The relationship between job reallocation and 
labour productivity between incumbent firms 
within sectors can be analysed using German 
firm- level data. To this end, the Bundesbank 
online survey of firms (Bundesbank Online 
Panel – Firms, BOP- F) was used.17 The fifth 
wave of the survey in May 2021 contains data 
on changes in turnover, sales price, employees 
and average production costs in 2020 com -pared with 2019. From this, the change in 
firms’ labour productivity in 2020 can be ap -
proximated and sector productivity growth can 
be broken down into the contributions of a 
firm- specific effect and a reallocation effect.18 
The firm- specific effect measures the sector 
productivity growth that, given the compos -
ition of employment, would result from 
changes in the average productivity of firms in 
the sector, for example due to changes in TFP 
or capital intensity. The reallocation effect is, in 
turn, again the sum of the level effect and 
growth effect. These effects are caused by 
within- sector changes in the employment 
shares of firms with different productivity levels 
or different productivity dynamics. The growth 
decomposition shows that the firm- specific ef -
fect in 2020 was strongly negative, at -4.7 per -
centage points. This means that average prod -
uctivity (in terms of number of employees) 
across firms fell sharply during the pandemic. 
This is due, in particular, to the use of short-  
time working, which enabled firms to retain 
employees despite high turnover losses. How -
ever, this was somewhat counteracted by the

15 The intrasectoral effect measures productivity growth 
within sectors on the assumption of no changes in the em -
ployment structure in the economy. The effect is calculated 
as the weighted sum of productivity growth in the sectors 
under review.
16 See Syverson (2011). An analysis based on large firm-  
level datasets for nine European countries concludes that 
intrasectoral job reallocation between incumbents was a 
key factor in sector productivity growth between 2007 and 
2016; see Modery et al. (2021).
17 The BOP- F is a firm- level survey dataset. Since June 
2020, the Bundesbank’s Research Centre and Research 
Data and Service Centre have been conducting the survey 
in cooperation with forsa, an external market research 
company. The survey consists of recurring key questions on 
firms’ economic situation and their expectations as well as 
special modules that vary from quarter to quarter and 
often address topical issues.
18 The analysis is based on a sample size of around 2,000 
firms. For these firms, weighting factors were applied in 
order to measure aggregate developments. The calculation 
of labour productivity follows the analyses for the United 
Kingdom published in Bloom et al. (2020). The growth de -
composition chosen corresponds to that for sector data.

average productivity lost out. By contrast, the 
reallocation growth effect was virtually irrele -
vant. The overall reallocation effect therefore 
dampened the decline in labour productivity by 
just under 1 percentage point. Aggregate la -
bour productivity, however, still fell by almost 
4%.
Given the small sample size of just over 2,000 
firms, these results based on the BOP- F are 
somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, in terms of 
the magnitude of the decline in productivity, 
they are roughly in line with those of the na -
tional accounts. The results suggest that in 
2020 reallocation effects among firms in the 
same sector increased labour productivity 
growth (measured in terms of number of em -
ployees) in Germany. However, this failed to 
offset the larger firm- specific losses in effi -
ciency.
Heterogeneous output devel -
opments among firms in the 
same sector
The COVID-19 crisis had an uneven impact on 
firms of different sizes within sectors, too. This 
is shown by further estimations based on 
Waves 1, 3 and 4 of the BOP- F survey data for 
2020.19 According to these estimations, even if, 
in particular, industry- specific effects are taken 
into account, output developments of smaller 
firms were significantly weaker than those of 
large enterprises because of the COVID-  19 cri -
sis. Conversely, larger firms weathered the 
2020 recession significantly better than smaller 
firms in the same sector. If, in addition, one 
takes into account that larger firms are more 
productive on average, the results are consist -
ent with the positive intrasectoral reallocation 
effects shown above.20 Larger firms tend to be 
more highly digitalised and were therefore able 
to implement remote working, for instance, 
more quickly and more efficiently, thereby min -
imising turnover losses (see the box on 
pp. 54 f.).21 In addition, they usually have greater 
financial means to cushion periods of slumping turnover growth.22 This is also likely to have 
had an impact on firms’ decisions to create and 
destroy jobs.

In addition, intrasectoral reallocation effects 
between incumbents can be analysed using an 
alternative dataset, the Bundesbank’s JANIS

to 2020. Based on this dataset, the relationship

Digitalisation in the German corporate sector since the 
onset of the coronavirus pandemic
One possible positive consequence of the 
coronavirus pandemic is often said to be a 
digitalisation boost in the corporate sector.1 
Faced with the measures taken to contain 
the pandemic and mandatory business clos-
ures, many fi  rms made greater use of re-
mote work and online distribution chan-
nels.2 This may also have necessitated add-
itional investment in the required digital 
technologies. However, the national ac-
counts indicators available for the corporate 
sector as a whole do not, to date, suggest 
that digitalisation in Germany has acceler-
ated. National accounts data show gross 
fi  xed capital formation in software and 
databases as well as in information and 
communication technology (ICT) in 2020 to 
have been below the average of the previ-
ous fi  ve years.3 Some other macroeconomic indicators which focus on the use of infor-
mation technology (IT) goods or the in-
ternal generation of proprietary digital solu-
tions through the increased use of IT human 
capital provide a more optimistic assess-
ment.4 Nonetheless, in a European com-
parison, Germany currently only occupies a 
mid- table position in terms of digitalisation 
according to the broad- based DESI index.
The latest Bundesbank Online Panel – Firms 
(BOP- F) provides data on digitalisation, 
broken down by category of fi  rm, for the 
period from April to June 2022. These data 
suggest that digitalisation has accelerated 
in some areas of the corporate sector since 
the pandemic,5 with roughly half of fi  rms 
investing signifi  cantly more in ICT and hard-
ware as well as software and databases in 
2020 than in the year preceding the crisis. 
One- sixth and one- seventh of fi  rms reported 
increasing their investment in, respectively, 
hardware and software by more than 10%. 
Investment growth was particularly pro-
nounced in some services sectors, such as 
the fi  nancial and insurance sector, as well as 
in education, health and social services. In 
2021, the share of fi  rms with higher invest-

(2020).
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021c) and German Eco-
nomic Institute (2021).
3 The fi  gure for investment in software and databases 
was below average in 2021, too. Data on investment 
in ICT are not yet available for 2021.
4 According to the European Commission’s Digital 
Economy and Society Index (DESI), the percentage of 
ICT specialists in the German workforce rose from 4% 
in 2019 to 4.7% in 2020.
5 Other survey results among German enterprises yield 
similar results overall. See, for example, European In-
vestment Bank (2022) and Bellmann et al. (2021). Ac-
cording to the results of the European Investment 
Bank’s Investment Survey, the push for digitalisation 
may even have been somewhat greater in Germany 
than the EU average.Investment in digital technologies

ment in hardware and software continued 
to grow, and investment volumes also in-
creased. At the fi  rm level, investment in the 
two years is closely correlated. This could 
therefore be more than just a temporary 
digitalisation boost in these fi  rms.
However, the results of the BOP- F suggest 
that digital technologies did not spread at 
the same pace in all fi  rms. A breakdown of 
the survey results by size category shows 
that large fi  rms, in particular, ramped up 
their investment in digital technologies. 
Around four- fi  fths of large fi  rms (with more 
than 200 employees) reported increasing 
investment in hardware and software. By 
contrast, this was the case for only around 
two- fi  fths of micro- fi  rms (with up to ten 
employees). In addition, fi  rms with liquidity 
bottlenecks and those experiencing a de-
cline in production during the coronavirus 
pandemic reported signifi  cantly weaker 
growth in investment in digital technolo-
gies. In 2021, those fi  rms that had made 
greater use of remote working arrange-
ments since the onset of the coronavirus 
pandemic, in particular, upped their invest-
ment in digital goods. All in all, the recent 
surge in digitalisation increased the digital 
advantage of large fi  rms, which tend to be 
more highly digitalised.
The results of the Bundesbank’s BOP- F paint 
a mixed picture in terms of productivity ef-
fects. On the one hand, they corroborate 
the optimistic assessment that the surge in 
digitalisation witnessed by the corporate 
sector since the onset of the coronavirus 
pandemic, which is at least somewhat more 
than just short term, could, on balance, 
strengthen future productivity growth. It is 
unclear in all this how persistent the in-
crease in digital uptake and the associated 
changes in fi  rms’ working processes will 
prove.6 On the other hand, large, product-
ive fi  rms, in particular, reported higher in-vestment in digital technologies, while digi-
talisation in smaller, less productive fi  rms 
barely accelerated.7 The uneven progress in 
digitalisation thus deepened the digital div-
ide in the German corporate sector. Owing 
to the slowdown in technology diffusion in 
recent years suggested by studies, aggre-
gate productivity gains could therefore be 
somewhat smaller than would have been 
expected were additional investment in 
digital technologies distributed more 
evenly.8

2020, the JANIS dataset shows a positive rela -
tionship between the level of firms’ labour 
productivity in the pre- crisis year of 2019 and 
employment growth in the crisis year of 2020, 
taking industry- specific effects into account.23 
This implies that those firms that were among 
the more productive before the crisis added 
more jobs (or reduced fewer jobs) in 2020 than 
those that were already less efficient before the 
crisis. The results are consistent with those of 
the BOP- F, as they indicate a positive intrasec -
toral reallocation level effect.
For a comparison over time, the above estima -
tion is carried out for different time periods. 
Specifically, the relationship between employ -
ment growth and the previous year’s level of 
labour productivity at the firm level is esti -
mated, taking into account other factors.24 
Changes in the estimated relationship over 
time indicate changes in the magnitude of 
productivity- enhancing reallocation, as they 
show the extent to which more productive 
firms add more jobs than less productive firms. 
As the dataset best covers manufacturing and 
retail trade corporations, the analysis is con -
fined to these areas.
A comparison of the relationship estimated for 
2020 with that for the years of the economic 
and financial crisis shows that the effects were roughly the same in both economic down -
turns. In particular, firms with a high level of 
productivity in the previous year added jobs at 
an accelerated pace during the two crises. The 
gap to the change in employment of low-  
productivity firms was, in each case, nearly 
4 percentage points.25 However, the estimated 
effect over the 2011 to 2019 period, i.e. be -
tween the crises, was on average markedly

23 The JANIS dataset contains annual financial statements 
of German non- financial corporations which are sent to the 
Bundesbank for credit assessment purposes, as well as 
financial statements from public sources (see Becker et al. 
(2022)). This is a non- representative sample of firms in 
which the coverage of individual sectors in part varies con -
siderably. In addition, the number of employees is not ne -
cessarily part of the annual financial statements submitted 
to the Bundesbank and is therefore reported only by some 
of the firms. In manufacturing and retail trade, the firm-  
level data needed for the analysis are available for a larger 
number of corporations. In order to approximate as closely 
as possible the aggregated effects for the sectors under re -
view, the regressions are weighted using weighting factors 
for turnover size classes and industries.
24 The regression model contains industry- specific effects; 
the variation across firms within industries is therefore used 
to identify the effect of interest. Labour productivity is de -
fined as value added per employee and enters the model as 
a deviation from the annual industry- specific mean. Value 
added is price adjusted using sector deflators. In addition, 
the regressions take into account firm size (total assets) in 
the previous year, firm age and year fixed effects. The esti -
mated model follows Foster et al. (2016) and Andrews et 
al. (2021).
25 For this calculation, firms whose productivity level was 
one standard deviation above the industry- specific mean in 
the year prior to the crisis were compared with firms whose 
productivity level was one standard deviation below the 
mean.Deutsche Bundesbank

larger. Over that period, the mean difference in 
growth rates between high- productivity and 
low- productivity firms amounted to 6.5  per -
centage points. Although estimation uncer -
tainty is quite high, especially for the effect cal -
culated for 2020, the results do suggest that 
productivity- enhancing employment realloca -
tion in the COVID-  19 crisis did not increase 
compared with non- crisis years.26 A cleansing 
effect is therefore not apparent on the basis of 
this analysis. The extensive government sup -
port measures may have been a contributing 
factor here. These may have protected some 
less productive firms from having had to reduce 
the workforce by more.27 By contrast, financial 
market frictions are unlikely to have signifi -
cantly impaired job reallocation during the pan -
demic.
Reallocation through firm 
entry
According to the German Council of Economic 
Experts, around 20% to 25% of job creation 
and job destruction in Germany is attributable 
to business start- ups and closures.28 Newly es -
tablished, innovative firms make an important 
contribution to productivity growth, job cre -
ation and economic structural change in the 
medium term. Following the recession- induced 
decline in business registrations in 2020, a 
strong countermovement was seen last year, 
with the number of start- ups rising by 9.7% on 
the year. On an average of 2020 and 2021, the 
number of business start- ups exceeded the 
average pre- crisis level of 2018 and 2019 by 
1.7%. Start-  ups therefore not only withstood 
the headwinds of the pandemic, but even in -
creased markedly. Even so, on account of the 
typically low initial number of people employed 
at such firms, fluctuations in the number of 
start- ups during the pandemic are likely to have 
had little impact on productivity, on balance. In 
the medium term, though, the increased num -
ber of start- ups could strengthen productivity 
(see the box on pp. 58 ff.).The sector structure of business start-  ups over 
the past two years also improved the outlook 
for productivity growth. It reflects the acceler -
ated structural shift towards knowledge- based 
services triggered by the pandemic. For ex -
ample, there was a sharp increase in the num -
ber of start- ups in the information and commu -
nication sector, primarily on the back of the 
growth seen in information technology services 
in 2021, which was more than 20% up on the 
pre- crisis year 2019. In addition, the number of 
start- ups in the field of scientific and technical 
activities (particularly consultancy firms) as well 
as in financial and insurance activities climbed 
steeply. These, too, are comparatively product -
ive sectors.29 At the same time, however, start- 
up figures in some less productive sectors in 
arithmetical terms also rose considerably as a 
result of the pandemic, with higher numbers 
being registered in sectors including retail 
trade, transporting (partly due to the sharp in -
crease in express services) as well as human 
health and social work activities. By contrast, 
business registrations in other less knowledge- 
intensive, less productive sectors, such as con -
struction and accommodation and food service 
activities, decreased significantly compared 
with the year before the onset of the crisis.
Reallocation through corpor -
ate insolvencies or closures
Corporate insolvencies declined sharply in both 
2020 and 2021, falling by -15.5% and -11.7%, Number of start- 
ups rose excep -
tionally sharply 
in 2021 …… on account 
of more start- 
ups in the 
knowledge- 
based services 
sector, amongst 
other things
26 Regressions for the United States and a panel of Euro -
pean countries also show that the reallocation effects in 
the economic and financial crisis were positive but not par -
ticularly pronounced (see Foster et al. (2016) and Bartels -
man et al. (2019)).
27 See Boeri and Bruecker (2011). Additional data are 
needed to evaluate the possible effects of the support 
measures on allocative efficiency in Germany. Analyses for 
other European countries conclude that firms with lower 
productivity tended to take greater recourse to govern -
ment support measures. See Kozeniauskas et al. (2022) and 
Bighelli et al. (2022).
28 See German Council of Economic Experts (2019).

The role of start- ups during the COVID- 19 crisis for 
economic  activity in Germany
Start- ups play an important role in the 
growth dynamics of the corporate sector. 
Young fi  rms do more than just create new 
jobs.1 They can also make important contri-
butions to productivity growth by bringing 
innovative products to market, strengthen-
ing competition and boosting the productivity- 
enhancing reallocation process in the cor-
porate sector.2 These effects usually materi-
alise only after a certain period of time, as 
newly established enterprises tend to ini-
tially employ a fairly small number of em-
ployees and cease operations again rela-
tively often. However, those start- ups that 
succeed in surviving in the market some-
times grow quickly and can thereby exert 
relevant macroeconomic effects.3
The number of start- ups established annu-
ally in Germany has declined sharply over 
the past two decades. More than 132,000 
head offi   ces were registered as businesses 
in 2002, compared with just over 86,000 in 
2014. This corresponds to a decline of 35%. 
Even though registrations stabilised in sub-
sequent years, on an average of the period from 2015 to 2019, the number of enter-
prises founded – around 88,000 head of-
fi  ces per year – was still relatively small. The 
2020 recession pushed fi  rm births down to 
just under 85,000 (a decline of 3.5% on the 
year). In the following year, however, they 
rose sharply, increasing by almost 10% to 
more than 93,000. On an average of the 
period from 2020 to 2021, then, the num-
ber of start- ups exceeded pre- pandemic 
levels.
But this does not yet constitute a trend re-
versal. Countermovements in the number 
of start- ups have already previously been 
observed in individual years without busi-
ness registrations then remaining at a higher 
level in the long run. In addition, there are 
structural reasons for declining fi  rm births – 
reasons on which the pandemic is unlikely 
to have had much of an impact. They have 
also led to declines in other countries in re-
cent years. One of these reasons is demo-
graphic change, something that is also af-
fecting Germany.4 In ageing populations, 
the generally lower level of creativity, higher 
average risk aversion, a shrinking labour 
force and usually more unfavourable growth 
prospects serve as barriers to establishing a 
start- up. Another reason could be the slower 
diffusion of knowledge from frontier fi  rms 
to other fi  rms in an industry that has been 
observed over the past two decades.5 A de-
cline in knowledge diffusion tends to be as-

sociated with shifts in the structure of mar-
kets and digital technologies. It makes it 
more diffi   cult for young fi  rms to catch up 
with market leaders, thereby reducing in-
centives to start a business.
The resilience of start- ups in Germany dur-
ing the pandemic may have prevented 
worse losses in value added, and it could 
support labour productivity in the medium 
term.6 That is because, had the short- term 
drop in fi  rm entry at the start of the pan-
demic not been rapidly counterbalanced, 
labour productivity would probably have 
been lower over the next few years. Follow-
ing a study by Gourio et al. (2016) for the 
United States, the role of fi  rm births for 
economic activity in Germany can be roughly 
estimated. Data from the Federal Statistical 
Offi   ce and State Statistical Offi   ces on start- 
ups, gross domestic product (GDP) and em-
ployed persons at the district level are used 
for this purpose. In addition to the estab-
lishment of main branches of enterprises, 
the establishment of dependent and inde-
pendent branches is also taken into ac-
count, as they can also be important for the 
local economy. An estimation model based 
on local projections shows how local GDP 
and local labour productivity change after 
an increase in the number of local start- 
ups.7 Various other determinants are also 
taken into account in the estimation frame-
work.8
The estimated effect of an increase in the 
number of start- ups on GDP in the fi  rst two 
years is close to zero and statistically insig-
nifi  cant. Only thereafter is there a signifi  -
cant positive relationship. This fi  nding re-
fl  ects the lagged, but distinct, effect of fi  rm 
entry on economic activity. By contrast, the 
estimated impact of the increase in the 
number of start- ups on local employment is 6 A sharp decline in fi  rm births can amplify losses in 
value added during crises and also slow the economic 
recovery. See Clementi and Palazzo (2016).
7 See Jordà (2005) and Gourio et al. (2016). The esti-
mation equation is as follows: yl,t+k = /gamma.stkgl,t + δkxl,t + 
αk
l + αk
rt + εk
lt, where  l denotes a NUTS 3 region (or 
district), r a NUTS 2 region (usually a government re-
gion) and t a year. yl,t+k is the dependent variable (GDP , 
employment or labour productivity) at time t + k, and 
gl,t represents the log change in the number of start- 
ups. xl,t contains control variables for the years t  and 
t – 1; these comprise the dependent variable as well as 
the population, GDP , participation rate, building land 
prices and the value added share of the manufacturing 
sector in district  l. With the exception of the local par-
ticipation rate obtained from the OECD, all data are 
from the Federal Statistical Offi   ce and State Statistical 
Offi   ces. αk
l and αk
rt are fi  xed district and government 
region- year effects. Fixed district effects take account 
of time- constant, unobserved differences between dis-
tricts. Fixed government region- year effects take ac-
count of unobserved annual shocks at the NUTS  2 
level. They refl  ect regional demand or supply shocks, 
for example. As only nominal GDP information is avail-
able at the district level, they also control for unob-
served price developments at the government region 
level. One assumption on which the analysis is based is 
that price developments of districts within government 
regions are similar and any differences are largely cap-
tured by the other control variables. The estimates are 
calculated using data from 2010 to 2019. The fi  rst and 
last percentile of the growth in the number of start- 
ups are winsorised.

respectively, on the year.30 Government sup -
port measures and the temporary suspension 
of the obligation to file for insolvency contrib -
uted substantially to this.31 The subsequent im -
plications for productivity growth depend on 
the types of firms that were protected from in -
solvency. Overall, preserving generally profit -
able firms which became distressed through 
external shocks as a result of the pandemic is 
likely to have a positive impact on aggregate 
productivity, as this shields productive jobs and 
productive capital. In particular, intangible 
knowledge capital pertaining to, for example, 
production and demand, corporate culture or 
relationships with customers and financial insti -
tutions would otherwise be lost, for the most 
part.32 If, on the other hand, it was mostly firms 
with low levels of productivity that benefited 
from the support measures – firms that would 
otherwise have closed were it not for the out -
break of the pandemic – the impact on aggre -
gate productivity would be unambiguously 
negative.Evaluations show that insolvencies, particularly 
among micro firms, fell sharply during the pan -
demic.33 These tended to be firms with below- 
average productivity. There is evidence that 
these firms benefited in part from free- rider ef -
fects.34 This means that some of these firms 
that benefited from support measures had al -
ready been experiencing financing problems 
before the pandemic and might have filed for 
insolvency in 2020 in the absence of these 
measures. However, owing to the small size of Insolvencies 
down sharply 
in 2020 and 
2021 …… particularly 
among micro 
firmsconsistently small and statistically insignifi  -
cant. This could be related to the fact that 
start- ups tend to recruit employees from 
other fi  rms or to hire displaced employees 
before they register as unemployed or leave 
the labour market. This supports the hypoth-
esis that start- ups promote the reallocation 
process in the corporate sector. The picture 
for labour productivity thus resembles the 
one for GDP . A signifi  cant positive effect is 
observed from the third year and ranges 
from 0.1% to 0.2%. Taken in isolation, the 
decline in fi  rm births in 2020 would there-
fore lead to one- off losses in labour prod-
uctivity growth of less than 0.1 percentage 
point three years later. While this effect is 
manageable, it is also not negligible when 
compared with the average growth in real 
gross value added per employed person in 
Germany of around 0.6% between 2011 
and 2019. That said, the results suggest 
that the subsequent strong rebound in the number of start- ups in 2021 more or less 
offsets this effect with a one- year lag.9
9 These back- of- an- envelope calculations do not take 
into account the sectoral structure of the start- ups.
30 Since the financial and economic crisis, insolvency fig -
ures had been continually declining (on an annual average 
of almost 6% between 2011 and 2019). During the crisis 
year of 2009, by contrast, they rose by 11.6%.
31 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b).
32 Guerrieri et al. (2022) show, furthermore, in a theoret -
ical framework, that an increase in firm exits resulting from 
an asymmetric negative shock such as the coronavirus pan -
demic can amplify a recession.

these firms, the impact on aggregate product -
ivity growth is likely to be modest.35
Many firms that close down are not involved in 
insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, such pro -
ceedings do not necessarily mean that a firm 
will exit the market. With regard to reallocation 
effects, then, closures are of particular signifi -
cance. But in business deregistrations, too, a 
sharp decline, of -13.6%, was seen in 2020, 
and in 2021, the number of business closures 
remained at the low level of the previous year. 
Business closures decreased in almost all sec -
tors. However, accommodation and food ser -
vice activities and trade alone accounted for 
half of the decline in business deregistrations, 
in numerical terms. Firms in these sectors were 
heavily affected by the measures taken to con -
tain the coronavirus pandemic, and therefore 
also benefited disproportionately from support 
measures. In this regard, these sectors in par -
ticular might see further firms exit the market 
with a lag once government support has been 
fully phased out, which means that certain 
productivity- enhancing effects might still ma -
terialise.
Conclusion
The coronavirus pandemic had a highly hetero -
geneous impact on the different parts of Ger -
many’s corporate sector, as evidenced by the 
large dispersion in the growth of value added 
and turnover over the past two years. The dis -
persion of employment growth was not quite 
as pronounced, but still increased on the years 
prior to the pandemic. However, the intersec -
toral shifts in employment shares did not pro -
duce any noteworthy productivity effects. Ana -
lyses based on firm- level microdata, on the 
other hand, suggest that the intrasectoral re -
allocation of jobs between firms bolstered 
productivity growth during the pandemic. Even 
so, labour productivity per person employed 
declined overall.Compared with the pre- crisis period, these 
productivity- enhancing reallocation effects 
were not particularly pronounced. This is con -
sistent with the sharp decline in the number of 
corporate insolvencies and business closures 
observed over the past two years among micro 
firms, which are usually more vulnerable to cri -
ses and tend to be less productive. Further -
more, business closures decreased steeply 
above all in the accommodation and food ser -
vice activities and retail trade sectors, which 
were hit hard by the pandemic and have low 
levels of productivity. Viewed overall, then, the 
pandemic did not trigger a pronounced cleans -
ing effect in Germany.
Government support measures are likely to 
have played an important role in this regard. 
Whilst a conclusive assessment of the product -
ivity effects produced by these measures is still 
pending, it can be said that this assistance for 
firms was granted according to how they had 
been affected by the pandemic and their finan -
cing requirements, whilst aspects such as the 
firms’ profitability were of secondary import -Steep decline in

ance.36 The aim of the measures was to sup -
port those firms that had run into difficulties 
through external shocks as a result of the pan -
demic – an aim which seems to have largely 
been achieved. As a result, productive capital is 
likely to have been preserved and systemic risk averted. That said, the government assistance 
measures may have partially hampered stronger 
productivity- enhancing reallocation effects.

The performance of German credit 
institutions  in 2021
German credit institutions recorded a strong improvement in performance in 2021 compared with 
the year before. Profit for the financial year before tax went up by €12.8 billion and, at €27.1 bil -
lion, hit almost double the previous year’s figure, taking it well above the long- term average of 
€18.0 billion for the first time since 2017.
Three- quarters of the increase was the result of a year- on- year reduction in net valuation charges 
of just over 70%. Against the backdrop of a strong macroeconomic recovery and the absence of 
the credit defaults initially feared at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, German banks 
scaled back risk provisioning significantly in comparison with 2020 and also released some of the 
risk provisions that they had formed that year. An increase in operating income of around 5% 
was another key contributor to the improvement in profit for the year before tax, though this rise 
was only slightly more than half as significant as the decline in net valuation charges. Meanwhile, 
the profit for the financial year before tax was weighed down by an increase in banks’ general 
administrative spending of around 6% as against 2020. Despite higher operating income, this led 
to a slight deterioration in cost efficiency: the cost/ income ratio of German credit institutions rose 
by 0.6 percentage point to 72.9% in the reporting year.
Net commission income proved to be the main driver of growth in operating income in 2021. 
Climbing by around 18%, it also further built up its role as the second most important source of 
income for German credit institutions. Net interest income, which remains the most important 
source of income, recorded a slight increase of 1.4% for the first time since 2018. Nevertheless, 
its share in operating income declined again in the reporting year. That said, the renewed decline 
in interest income was more than offset for the institutions by a more pronounced reduction in 
interest expenditure. In addition, up by around 40%, the trading result also fed into the increase 
in operating income, whereas the other operating result deteriorated by more than two- thirds on 
the year. The trading result and other operating result remained only of minor importance as 
sources of income, however.
In the current year, Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine, in particular, is acting as a drag on 
macroeconomic developments in Germany and around the globe. With this comes an increased 
likelihood of credit defaults among both non- financial corporations and households, which could 
take a toll on the profitability of German credit institutions. Furthermore, against the backdrop of 
significantly higher inflation expectations, the European Central Bank (ECB) has adjusted its mon -
etary policy stance and taken first steps to bring the era of negative interest rates to an end. 
Although the rising interest rate level could weigh on German banks’ profitability in the short 
term, the earnings- enhancing effects of monetary policy normalisation are likely to bolster the 
performance of German institutions in the medium term.Deutsche Bundesbank

Business environment and 
structural developments in 
the German banking sector
In 2021, German credit institutions once again 
faced a challenging market environment that 
was still characterised by the effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing nega -
tive interest rate environment. However, the 
feared defaults on loans did not materialise. A 
strong macroeconomic recovery overall, com -
bined with extensive monetary and fiscal policy 
measures, helped the German banking system 
to close the reporting year in better shape than 
expected and continue to perform its functions 
unimpaired.1
Macroeconomic setting
Following the sharp slump in the previous year, 
economic output in Germany rose steeply in 
2021. Despite growth of 2.9%, however, gross 
domestic product (GDP) nevertheless remained 
significantly below the pre- crisis level of 2019.2 
Industry, in particular, suffered from bottlenecks 
in the supply of intermediate goods, preventing 
it from fully realising growth potential. By con -
trast, private consumption and the services sec -
tor were able to rebound strongly in some 
cases during the second and third quarters of 
2021, once coronavirus protection measures 
were lifted. Extensive containment measures in 
response to infection rates in the fourth quarter 
led to severe setbacks to both, though.3
Against this backdrop, German fiscal policy 
again made a vital contribution to stabilisation 
in 2021. The economy and households received 
considerable support in the shape of measures 
such as transfers to enterprises and short- time 
working benefits.4 The stabilisation measures 
introduced by bank regulators in 20205 were 
also initially kept in place in the reporting year, 
though their appropriateness was the subject 
of ongoing review over the course of the year. 
For example, the recommendation that banks 
limit dividends, and the flexibility granted by supervisory authorities regarding general pay -
ment moratoria both ended.6 The aforemen -
tioned measures had a hand in preventing the 
defaults on loans that had been feared in the 
early days of the pandemic and enabling banks’ 
lending to the real economy to go on unhin -
dered.7
Like the fiscal policy and bank regulatory meas -
ures, monetary policy, too, continued to be in -
fluenced by the coronavirus pandemic in 2021. 
As the Governing Council of the ECB expected 
inflation rates of below 2% in the medium 
term, it maintained its very expansionary mon -
etary policy stance. The key interest rates were 
left unchanged at their historically low levels8 
and the asset purchase programme (APP) was 
continued.9 The emergency monetary policy 
measures introduced to combat the effects of 
the coronavirus pandemic were also kept in 
place. The aim was still primarily to provide 
banks with liquidity and, ultimately, to ensure 
the supply of credit to the real economy. Add -

economy. The aim of the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) was to counter 
the pandemic- related risks to monetary policy 
transmission.12
The monetary policy, fiscal policy and banking 
regulatory measures not only supported the 
German banking system, but also had a posi -
tive impact on the equity and bond markets. In 
the first two quarters of 2021, German stock 
markets temporarily hit historical highs owing 
to firmer prospects of a macroeconomic recov -
ery and higher corporate earnings expect -
ations.13 In the fourth quarter of 2021, how -
ever, the upturn in the equity markets came to 
a halt, and the picture was predominantly one 
of moderate price losses on the previous quar -
ter. This was due to rising inflationary risks and 
the resulting market expectations of imminent 
monetary policy tightening.14
In the bond markets, hopes of the economic 
recovery continuing led yields on ten- year Fed -
eral bonds (Bunds) to rise somewhat, reaching 
roughly the level recorded at the start of 2020. 
From then, they moved sideways under the in -
fluence of changing assessments of the pan -
demic situation, only surging from the end of 
the fourth quarter of 2021 due to rising infla -
tionary pressure coupled with market expect -
ations of monetary policy tightening. This put 
the yields on ten- year Bunds back in positive 
territory for the first time since the second 
quarter of 2019.15 At the close of 2021, the 
yield curve derived from the yields on Federal 
securities was considerably steeper in the short 
and medium- term maturity segments than it 
had been at the beginning of the year.16
Balance sheet and structural 
developments in the German 
banking sector
Growth in the aggregate of German credit in -
stitutions’ annual average total assets17 was 
down by just under two- thirds compared with 
2020. At 2.8%, the growth rate of average total assets in 2021 was close to its long- term 
average of 2.0%.
However, when looking at individual categories 
of banks, there were greater disparities than in 
2020. While 2020 saw aggregate annual aver -
age total assets rise across all categories of 
banks, big banks, in particular, recorded a de -
cline of 10.5% in 2021. By contrast, savings 
banks and credit cooperatives registered slightly 
higher growth rates in 2021 than in the previ -
ous year, at 7.7% each. In both cases, lending 
and deposit business is likely to have been the 
main driver of this, having grown somewhat 
more strongly in the reporting year than in 
2020.18 However, regional banks and other 
commercial banks recorded the highest year-  
on- year growth in their balance sheet (+26.3%), 
with just over two-  thirds of the total increase 
attributable to a single institution that ex -
panded its presence in Germany after Brexit.19
According to data from the monthly balance 
sheet statistics, the assets and liabilities sides of 
the aggregated bank balance sheet followed a 
similar growth pattern to 2020 in the reporting 
year, albeit developing at a slower pace in 
some cases. With regard to the assets side of 
the aggregated bank balance sheet, German 
banks’ balances with the central bank once 
again constituted the most significant growth 
item. On an annual average for 2021, a sharp Equity and bond

17 The figure for total assets was determined on the basis 
of the rules contained in the German Commercial Code 
(Handelsgesetzbuch).
18 According to data from the monthly balance sheet stat -
istics, savings banks saw slightly higher growth in lending 
to domestic non- banks in 2021 than in 2020 – a 0.2 per -
centage point rise taking it to +4.9%; credit cooperatives 
recorded growth of +6.6%, which was 0.6  percentage 
point higher than in the previous year. At +7.0% in each 
case, both categories of banks saw domestic non- banks’ 
deposits grow roughly 0.6 percentage point more strongly 
than in the previous year.

increase here resulted in a new historical high 
of around €1,000 billion in total. At +43.0%, 
the percentage growth was slightly below the 
level of the previous year, but the absolute in -
crease of €307 billion again exceeded the 2020 
figure by a significant margin of around €90 
billion.20 Chiefly responsible for the increase in 
balances with the central bank were the Euro -
system’s asset purchase programmes (public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP) and PEPP) 
and German banks’ extensive use of TLTRO-  
III.21
As in 2020, lending continued to be a signifi -
cant factor in driving growth on the assets side 
of the aggregated bank balance sheet in the 
reporting year. However, with an increase of 
€114 billion in total (previous year: €144 bil -
lion), the contribution made by loans to do -
mestic non- banks only amounted to slightly 
more than one- third of total growth, compared 
with balances with the central bank. Loan 
growth in 2021 was one percentage point 
lower than in 2020, averaging 3.2%. This is 
likely to have been mainly due to the decline in 
short- term loans to enterprises and house -
holds, which were down by an annual average 
of 5.8%. The second quarter of 2021, in par -
ticular, saw increased repayments of short- term 
loans to enterprises, some of which had been 
taken out as a precautionary measure intended 
to safeguard liquidity during the coronavirus 
pandemic. The upturn in overall economic ac -
tivity as well as the disbursement of govern -
ment transfers to firms particularly hard- hit by 
the coronavirus pandemic meant firms’ finan -
cing needs lessened in the second quarter of 
2021.22 Besides this, reduced consumer lending 
also played into the decline. In the first and 
fourth quarters of 2021, especially, the restric -
tions on economic and social life as a result of 
the pandemic had a dampening effect here.23
Distinct growth was recorded, meanwhile, for 
medium and long- term loans to domestic non- 
financial corporations and households. Even so, 
the 5.1% increase was slightly shy of the 20-  
year peak of 5.3% reached in 2020. As in the previous year, housing loans were the main 
driver of this development. At 7.1%, their 
growth in the reporting year even outstripped 
the 20- year historical high of the previous year 
by one percentage point.
Comparing the categories of banks, savings 
banks and credit cooperatives recorded the 
highest growth rates for housing loans, at 
+7.7% and +8.8%, respectively. In addition, 
savings banks and credit cooperatives together 
accounted for just under two- thirds of the ab -
solute increase in housing loans.
As before, this growth was the product of fac -
tors on both the supply and demand side. In 
particular, robust activity in the construction 
sector and a continuation of favourable finan -
cing costs, but also the sharp rise in prices for 
construction work and residential property, are 
likely to have buoyed the persistently brisk de -
mand for housing loans.24
Greater demand also drove considerable 
growth in medium and long- term loans to non- 
financial corporations. The overall economic re -
covery in the third quarter of 2021 led to an in -
crease in financing needs, especially in domes -
tically oriented sectors such as construction 
and real estate. In addition, funding needs for 
refinancing, debt restructuring and renegoti -
ation remained at elevated levels.25
On the supply side, too, banks continued to 
have a heightened interest in lending business, 
as obtaining the particularly attractive interest 
rate on TLTRO- III operations was contingent 
upon hitting specific lending performance 
thresholds for the relevant reporting dates.26 Lending the

Interpreting profi  tability components broken down by 
category  of banks in the context of Brexit
The balance sheet and profi  t and loss statistics 
of banks, or monetary fi  nancial institutions 
(MFIs),1 are broken down by category of banks. 
This makes it easier not only to identify and 
compare trends but also to better take ac-
count of the specifi  cs and particularities of the 
individual categories.
The Bundesbank considers a variety of criteria 
when assigning individual banks to a particu-
lar category of banks,2 and it also reviews these 
assignments annually.3
Brexit has seen the German banking sector 
face major structural changes in recent years, 
and these will continue to shape develop-
ments in the years to come: so that they 
might still be able to provide services in the 
European Union, large and international 
banks have taken steps from 2019 onwards 
such as relocating large parts of their business 
out of the United Kingdom to existing or 
newly founded institutions established in the 
European Union, including in Germany. “Brexit 
banks” is the catch- all used here to refer to 
these institutions.4 The resulting business 
policy , structural and organisational adjust-
ments concern the “Regional banks and other 
commercial banks” category, in particular, but 
also, to some extent, the “Branches of foreign 
banks” and “Foreign banks” categories (the 
latter of which is a memo item).
The business models of the Brexit banks differ, 
in some cases considerably, from those of 
other banks based in Germany. For example, 
the business relocated to these institutions 
stems predominantly from capital market 
business. This income is refl  ected mainly in net 
commission income and the trading result. In 
addition, some Brexit banks primarily conduct 
Europe- wide business that is not linked to the 
German market and thus only partially refl  ects 
the profi  tability of local business. Whilst other 
German banks also operate business models 
that cover all of Europe, the scale of these is 
especially great for some large Brexit banks.
Looking at current profi  tability components by 
category of banks, Brexit banks are becoming increasingly important, especially among re-
gional banks and other commercial banks. 
Owing to their size and the ongoing expan-
sion of their total assets, this effect is also 
likely to be observed to an ever- greater extent 
over the next few years.5 The signifi  cant im-
provement in the net commission income and 
trading result of regional banks and other 
commercial banks by around 40% and around 
130% respectively in 2021 was due chiefl  y to 
the growth of a few major Brexit banks. How-
ever, the rise in administrative spending for 
regional  banks and other commercial banks 
compared with 2020 was also due in large 
part to Brexit banks’ expanded business 
volume .
The increasing importance of Brexit banks 
needs to be taken into account when inter-
preting the profi  tability components con-
sidered in this article, with a specifi  c focus on 
regional banks and other commercial banks.
1 MFIs pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2021/ 379 of the 
European Central Bank (ECB/ 2021/ 2), Article 2(1) (OJ 
L 73, 3 March 2021, pp. 16-85).
2 Factors taken into consideration include business 
structure, type of business activity predominantly con-
ducted (e.g. universal versus specialised bank), size of 
the bank, legal form, banking association membership, 
presence of a bank offi   ce network, operations abroad 
(via branches and subsidiaries), degree or scope of the 
bank’s investment in other enterprises (participating 
interests, etc.), and ownership structure of the bank 
being assigned.

banks are broken down, see the section “Categories of 
banks” under “Explanatory notes” (https://www.

4 It is not possible to clearly distinguish business re-
locations and changes to business models caused by 
Brexit from business policy decisions triggered by other 
factors. In addition, Brexit banks sometimes differ con-
siderably in terms of their business models and the ex-
tent of their relocation activities. However, in the case 
of the institutions analysed here, Brexit was initially the 
main factor behind any changes. For the purposes of 
this box, this distinction is enough to highlight diffi   cul-
ties in interpreting profi  tability components given the 
business relocations and changes to business models 
within the affected categories of banks.
5 In 2021, Brexit banks accounted for just over 80% of 
the increase in the annual average total assets of re-
gional banks and other commercial banks.Deutsche Bundesbank

However, according to the Bank Lending Sur -
vey, neither lending to non- financial corpor -
ations nor to households saw any significant 
easing in credit standards and credit terms and 
conditions.27 Private housing loans was the 
only area where credit standards and credit 
terms and conditions eased in the second quar -
ter of 2021, though they were soon tightened 
again in the third quarter. This was due to an 
elevated level of credit risk according to banks’ 
assessments and a reduced tolerance for risk.28
On the liabilities side of the aggregated bank 
balance sheet, pandemic- related uncertainty 
regarding future economic developments as 
well as restricted consumption options sent the 
volume of domestic households’ and non- financial 
corporations’ deposits soaring again. However, 
the increase weakened significantly over the 
course of 2021, mainly as a result of changes in 
household investment behaviour, meaning that 
only slight growth was seen towards the end 
of the year.29 With average interest rates par -
ticularly on overnight deposits having fallen 
further over the course of the year and inflation 
rates having increased, households are likely to 
have become more acutely aware of the real 
costs involved in holding money.30
Overall, at 4.4%, the annual average increase 
in deposits held by domestic non- banks31 at 
German credit institutions in 2021 was around 
0.5 percentage point lower than in the previ -
ous year. However, the total volume of €3,953 
billion meant that a new historical high was 
reached. As in 2020, growth was concentrated 
on sight deposits, though at 9.6% their growth 
rate in the reporting year was just over one 
percentage point lower than in the previous 
year. By contrast, time and savings deposits 
were further scaled back.
Unlike in the previous year, developments in 
the deposit business varied widely across the 
different categories of banks. In the reporting 
year, larger growth was almost exclusively the 
preserve of savings banks, credit cooperatives 
and big banks.Looked at in aggregate terms, the annual aver -
age balance sheet equity32 of German banks 
rose by 1.6% to €536 billion in 2021. Increases 
– in some cases substantial ones – were re -
corded by all categories of banks33 except for 
big banks (-19.8%) and mortgage banks 
(-6.2%).34 Regional banks and other commer -
cial banks posted the highest growth rate 
(+16.0%). A significant portion of that growth 
was attributable to institutions that strength -
ened their presence in Germany in the wake of 
Brexit. Credit cooperatives and savings banks 
augmented their balance sheet equity by 6.4% 
and 3.7%, respectively, on an average for 2021.
Overall, the consolidation process in the Ger -
man banking sector continued at an acceler -
ated pace in 2021. The total number of credit 
institutions decreased by 4.2%, following a 
year- on- year decline of only 2.2%. This was 
due, in particular, to mergers among credit co -
operatives and departures of branches of for -
eign banks as a result of Brexit.35Another sharp

porations, other financial corporations, general govern -
ment and non- profit institutions.

34 When interpreting the data on the equity base, it 
should be borne in mind that the amounts transferred from 
the profit for the respective financial year do not increase 
balance sheet equity until the year after the annual ac -
counts are adopted, while withdrawals from equity items 
are to be deducted at the latest when the annual accounts 
are prepared. Furthermore, as the data on the equity base 
are calculated as annual average values, the decline shown 
here for the big banks does not reflect losses actually ob -
served in 2021, but rather a decline in equity capital already 
recorded in 2020 as a result of restructuring measures 
taken in 2019. For more details, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2020), pp. 95 ff.

making use of EU passport arrangements by the end of

Bundesbank (2022c), p. 2.Deutsche Bundesbank

The number of branches in Germany also fell 
again significantly, recording a decline of al -
most 10%. In addition to the impact of digital -
isation on distribution channels as a result of 
greater use of online banking,36 this was also 
due to cost- cutting measures undertaken in the 
challenging business environment. Big banks, 
in particular, reduced their number of branches 
as part of extensive restructuring, but savings 
banks and credit cooperatives also scaled back 
their branch networks further.37
Performance, profitability 
and cost efficiency
Generally speaking, the performance of Ger -
man credit institutions improved considerably 
in 2021 compared with the previous year. On 
account of higher results for the financial year 
before tax, almost all of the categories of banks 
considered in the statistics on banks’ profit and 
loss accounts38 were able to increase both their return on equity and their return on assets sub -
stantially. The aggregate profit for the financial 
year before tax almost doubled compared with 
2020.
The main driver of this development was a 
sharp decline in net valuation charges com -
pared with the previous year. German credit in -
stitutions significantly reduced their risk provi -
sioning against the backdrop of low credit de -
faults and an improved macroeconomic envir -

Bundesbank pursuant to Section 26 of the German Bank -
ing Act (Kreditwesengesetz).  As the annual accounts apply 
to the whole institution (but not to the group), the charges 
and income of foreign branches are also recorded. See also

onment. A comparatively strong rise in income 
from operating business also contributed sig -
nificantly to the improvement in profitability. 
Compared with net valuation charges, how -
ever, this increase played a less significant role 
in the growth in the profit for the financial year 
before tax.
Profitability was negatively affected by a sharp 
rise in administrative spending, which was at -
tributable to staff costs and other administra -
tive spending in equal measure. Nevertheless, 
measured by the cost/ income ratio, German 
banks’ cost efficiency deteriorated only margin -
ally on account of operating income, which 
also went up.
Return on equity and return 
on assets
Overall, the return on equity (profit for the 
financial year before tax in relation to the an -
nual average balance sheet equity) almost 
doubled in 2021. Furthermore, a rise of 2.3 per -
centage points to 5.1% put it only slightly 
below the long- term average of 5.2%. This in -
dicates a significant improvement in profitabil -
ity, chiefly attributable to the increase in the 
profit for the financial year before tax driven by 
net valuation charges.
Apart from building and loan associations,39 all 
categories of banks under review40 improved 
their return on equity. However, when compar -
ing categories of banks, the extent of this im -
provement varies considerably. For example, 
Landesbanken more than tripled their return on 
equity in 2021 compared with the previous 
year owing to a sharp rise in the profit for the 
financial year. At 4.1%, their return on equity 
was also well above the long- term average of 
1.4%. By contrast, savings banks (+0.9 percent -
age point) and credit cooperatives (+1.1 per -
centage point) recorded relatively small rises in 
their return on equity. In both cases, strong 
growth in balance sheet equity counteracted 
the positive effect on their return on equity arising from the increase in profit for the finan -
cial year before tax. For savings banks, growth 
in equity capital reduced the increase in their 
return on equity by 20%; for credit coopera -
tives, this increase was narrowed by as much as 
one- third. With levels of 6.3% and 8.4%, re -
spectively, savings banks and credit coopera -
tives were nonetheless still among the categor -
ies with the highest return on equity in the re -
porting year, although both categories of banks 
also fell clearly short of their long- term aver -
ages (savings banks: 10.1%; credit coopera -
tives: 10.5%) in 2021. Regional banks and other 
commercial banks were almost on par with 
savings banks in the year under review. Despite 
the strong growth in balance sheet equity, they 
improved their return on equity by 1.9 percent -
age point, raising it to 6.0% and thereby reach -
ing the level of their long- term average. The in -
creasing influence of Brexit banks on the cat -
egory of regional banks and other commercial 
banks’ profit for the financial year is likely to 
have played a major role in this development. 
However, it was big banks that achieved the 
largest improvement in their return on equity, 
posting an increase of 4.8 percentage points 
and thereby having a substantial impact on 
positive overall development. That said, big 
banks’ return on equity remained in negative 
territory at -2.3%.41
In general, the return on assets (the ratio of 
profit for the financial year before tax to annual 
average total assets) moved in parallel with the 
return on equity. With a rise of 0.13 percentage 
point, the return on assets almost doubled in 
2021, driven by the profit for the financial year 
before tax. Furthermore, at 0.29%, it reached a 
level above its long- term average of 0.22% 
again for the first time since 2018.Return on equity

Methodological notes
The results from the profi  t and loss ac-
counts are based on the published annual 
reports of the individual institutions in ac-
cordance with the provisions set forth in 
the German Commercial Code (Handels-
gesetzbuch) and the Regulation on the 
Account ing of Credit Institutions (Verord-
nung über die Rechnungslegung der Kredit-
institute). In terms of their conception, 
structure and defi  nitions, they differ from 
the International Financial Reporting Stand-
ards (IFRS)1 for publicly traded banking 
groups. This means that – from a methodo-
logical viewpoint  – business performance 
and certain balance sheet or individual 
profi  t and loss items are not comparable 
across the national and international ac-
counting frameworks. For reasons of com-
parability within Germany, it is advisable to 
consider the individual accounts when ana-
lysing fi  nancial performance. The fi  gures for 
balance sheet capital (total equity), total 
assets and other stock variables are not ob-
tained from the annual reports but are 
taken as annual average values on the basis 
of the monthly balance sheet statistics re-
ported for the institution as a whole.
The reporting group for statistics on banks’ 
profi  t and loss accounts includes all banks 
which are monetary fi  nancial institutions 
(MFIs) that conform to the defi  nition of a 
credit institution under the Capital Require-
ments Regulation (CRR) as set forth in 
Article   4(1) number 1 of Regulation (EU) 
No  575/ 2013 and are domiciled in Ger-
many. Branches of foreign banks that are 
exempted from the provisions of Section 53 
of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesen-
gesetz, or KWG), banks in liquidation and 
banks with a fi  nancial year of less than 12 
months (truncated fi  nancial year) are not in-
cluded in this performance analysis.At the launch of monetary union in 1999, 
the reporting group relevant for calculating 
the money supply and for monetary analy-
sis was uniformly defi  ned by the European 
Central Bank (ECB) for the euro area as a 
whole and designated as the MFI sector. 
Unlike the population of banks used for the 
Bundesbank’s analysis up to that point, 
building and loan associations are also in-
cluded. Except where another time period 
is explicitly mentioned, the calculations with 
regard to the longer- term average cover the 
years since the launch of monetary union, 
i.e. from 1999 to 2021.
1 IFRS- based fi  nancial statements are of relevance, for 
instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and 
oversight, concentrating on systemically important 
banks and their international business activities (includ-
ing their foreign subsidiaries). For details, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013).Deutsche Bundesbank

Year- on- year balance sheet growth had no not -
able impact on the increase in the return on 
assets overall. In individual categories of banks, 
however, its effect on the change in the return 
on assets was significant. High balance sheet 
growth at regional banks and other commer -
cial banks driven by Brexit banks had a particu -
larly strong impact. The positive impact of the 
rise in the profit for the financial year on the re -
turn on assets was halved in this case by bal -
ance sheet growth. The remaining growth of 
0.11 percentage point was nevertheless suffi -
cient to reach a level of 0.41%, which was well 
above the long- term average of 0.32%. In the 
reporting year, savings banks raised their return 
on assets by 0.06 percentage point to 0.54%, 
but were thus still below the long- term average 
of 0.62%. Together with credit cooperatives, 
which reached a level of 0.70% following an 
increase of 0.08 percentage point in 2021, sav -
ings banks ranked once again among the cat -
egories of banks with the highest return on 
assets. Unlike savings banks, however, credit cooperatives’ return on assets was slightly 
above their long- term average of 0.67%. Com -
paratively strong balance sheet growth – mainly 
caused by the renewed strong expansion in de -
posit and lending business – also curbed the in -
crease in savings banks and credit coopera -
tives’ return on assets significantly. In both 
cases, balance sheet growth reduced the in -
crease in the return on assets – attributable to 
the rise in the profit for the financial year – by 
just over one- third.
Profit for the financial year
The profit for the financial year before tax went 
up by a total of €12.8 billion in 2021 compared 
with the previous year. At €27.1 billion, it was 
almost twice the previous year’s figure, mainly 
owing to the sharp reduction in net valuation 
charges and thus, for the first time since 2017, 
was both well above the long- term average of 
€18.0 billion and above the average of €25.4 
billion for the years following the financial crisis 
(2010 to 2018).
Unlike in 2020, all of the categories of banks42 
under review were able to substantially in -
crease their annual result before tax, except for 
building and loan associations.43 In absolute 
terms, the largest growth was recorded by the 
big banks, whose annual result rose by €4.5 
billion. Nevertheless, they were the only cat -
egory of banks to end the reporting year with 
a loss before tax, though, at €1.5 billion, this 
figure amounted to only one- quarter of the 
shortfall incurred in 2020. By contrast, savings 
banks and credit cooperatives again recorded 
the largest profits for the financial year before 
tax across all categories of banks. At €8.2 bil -
lion and €7.7 billion respectively, together they Profit for the

generated almost 60% of the aggregate profit 
for the 2021 financial year. However, despite 
sharp increases of €1.4 billion each, savings 
banks and credit cooperatives recorded the 
lowest growth rates (savings banks: +21.3%; 
credit cooperatives: +22.2%) of all categories 
of banks.44 Regional banks and other commer -
cial banks recorded a sharp rise of €2.3 billion 
(+70.6%) – the growing significance of Brexit 
banks had an impact here, too.
Net valuation charges45 decreased by €9.7 bil -
lion in the year under review to around one-  
quarter of their figure for the previous year. To -
talling €3.6 billion, they were not only well 
below their long- term average of €13.5 billion, 
but rather the decline in 2021 also more than 
offset the doubling of net valuation charges 
seen in the previous year due to the pandemic 
and made a major contribution to the increase 
in profit for the financial year before tax in 
2021.German credit institutions significantly scaled 
back their risk provisioning compared with the 
previous year and released some of the risk 
provisions they had formed in 2020 during the 
reporting year. For example, depreciation of 
and value adjustments to loans and advances, 
and provisions for contingent liabilities and for 
commitments halved and, at €7.0 billion, were

income from value readjustments to loans and 
advances, and provisions for contingent liabil -
ities and for commitments doubled on the year 
to €3.4 billion. This item had still been declin -
ing in 2020. In absolute terms, at €7.9 billion, 
the decrease in the depreciation of and value 
adjustments to loans and advances, and provi -
sions for contingent liabilities and for commit -
ments accounted for just over 80% of the total 
decline in net valuation charges.
There were several reasons for this develop -
ment. For example, the high number of de -
faults on loans feared at the beginning of the 
coronavirus pandemic did not materialise, not 
least due to extensive fiscal and monetary pol -
icy measures.46 Furthermore, given the more 
favourable macroeconomic situation overall 
and with the share of non- performing loans in 
the total credit volume declining up to the third 
quarter of 2021, German banks still assessed 
credit risk to be low.47The reduction in net valuation charges was 
generally observed across all categories of 
banks, albeit to varying degrees. In particular, 
savings banks and credit cooperatives – which 
together generated more than half of the ag -
gregate profit for the financial year before tax 
in 2021 – but also big banks reduced their net 
valuation charges by around 90% or more on 
the year. In contrast to the overall develop -
ment, however, a relatively large share of the 
drop in net valuation charges at savings banks 
and credit cooperatives was also attributable to 
higher income from value readjustments to 
loans and advances, and provisions for contin -
gent liabilities and for commitments. Mean -
while, at around 40%, regional banks and 
other commercial banks decreased their net 
valuation charges to a comparatively moderate 
degree, even though they had made the larg -All categories of

est contribution in absolute terms to the in -
crease in net valuation charges in 2020.
German credit institutions’ operating business 
proved robust in 2021 despite the prolonged 
negative interest rate environment and the 
coronavirus pandemic. Operating income48 ex-
panded relatively sharply on the year by €5.8 
billion (+4.8%). Thus, both the absolute and 
percentage increase were more than three 
times the level recorded in 2020. Furthermore, 
operating income in 2021 was the second 
major driver of the increase in the aggregate 
profit for the financial year before tax; none -
theless, the decline in net valuation charges 
was almost twice as significant.
The expansion in operating income in 2021 
was primarily caused by strong growth in net 
commission income. Increases in net interest 
income and the trading result also had a posi -
tive impact on operating income. Taken to -
gether, however, these increases were just suf -
ficient to offset the decline in the other operat -
ing result. In line with this, the shares of the in -
dividual sources of income in total operating 
income shifted slightly. With a share of around 
two- thirds of operating income, net interest in -
come was again the most important source of 
income for German banks in 2021. However, its 
share in operating income fell again compared with 2020. By contrast, net commission income 
built up its role as the second most important 
source of income, accounting for 30% of oper -
ating income. The trading result and other op -
erating result remained only of minor import -
ance overall.
After all categories of banks except for savings 
banks had recorded increases in their operating 
income in 2020, the picture was much more 
mixed in 2021. For example, growth in operat -
ing income was observed particularly at re -
gional banks and other commercial banks and 
at credit cooperatives. Due to the growing im -
portance of Brexit banks, regional banks and 
other commercial banks recorded the largest 
growth, both in absolute terms (+€4.2 billion) 
and in relative terms (+19.5%), driven primarily 
by net commission income and the trading re -
sult. Credit cooperatives came in second with 
an increase of +€1.0 billion; they benefited 
chiefly from net commission income, followed 
by net interest income.
In 2021, it was mainly big banks and once more 
savings banks that recorded declines in their 
operating income (-€0.6 billion and -€0.2 bil -
lion, respectively). In the case of savings banks, Operating

a relatively steep drop in net interest income 
outstripped the increase in net commission in -
come. By contrast, big banks saw a sharp de -
crease in the other operating result outweigh 
their otherwise positive growth in net interest 
income and commission income.
German credit institutions’ net interest income 
rose slightly in the year under review for the 
first time since 2018 and, at €82.2 billion, was

come from shares and other variable- yield 
securities, as well as from participating inter -
ests, which are likewise included in net interest 
income. By contrast, net interest income in the 
narrower sense, i.e. the contribution to earn -
ings by interest- related business, improved only 
slightly despite increased lending. Looking at 
the categories of banks, the rise in net interest 
income was generally broad- based: with the 
exception of savings banks and building and 
loan associations, all of the categories of banks 
under review49 recorded higher net interest in -
come than in 2020. The largest individual con -
tributions to the growth in total net interest in -
come were made by big banks as well as re -
gional banks and other commercial banks, ac -
counting for €0.5 billion each. Landesbanken 
and credit cooperatives also made significant 
contributions to the overall expansion, each re -
cording a rise in net interest income of €0.3 bil -
lion on the year. Conversely, with a drop of 
€0.9 billion (-4.2%), savings banks were the 
only category of banks to record a significant 
decline in net interest income.50
Overall, the increase in net interest income in 
2021 was achieved on the back of parallel de -
velopments in interest income and interest ex -
penditure. Thus, interest income in the broader Net interest

sense51 fell by €9.1 billion on the year in 2021, 
while interest expenditure dropped by €10.2 
billion over the same period. Unlike in previous 
years, German credit institutions were able to 
more than offset the decline in interest income 
by lowering interest expenditure in the report -
ing year. Moreover, this development was ob -
served not only at the aggregate level, but also 
across all categories of banks52 except savings 
banks and building and loan associations.
In the reporting year, the persistent negative 
interest rate environment led to lower interest 
income for German credit institutions, not only 
as a result of the negative remuneration of ex -
cess liquidity in the Eurosystem’s deposit facil -
ity.53 In fact, interest rates for lending dropped 
again, according to data from the MFI interest 
rate statistics. Alongside interest rates on loans 
to enterprises, this particularly related to inter -
est rates in the high- volume business of lending 
to households. As a consequence, even the 
high growth in the volume of lending business 
–  especially in the granting of new housing 
loans – was unable to halt the decline in inter -
est income. However, in 2021, German banks 
made greater use of instruments to lower their 
interest expenditure than they had in the previ -
ous year. This included the near full utilisation 
of exemption allowances, introduced at the 
end of 2019, for the negative deposit facility 
rate as well as the further expanded use of re -
financing operations with the Eurosystem at 
sometimes negative rates (in particular TLTRO-  
III).54 Moreover, further extensive changes to 
terms and conditions for customer deposit 
business (including the increased passing on of 
negative interest rates)55 contributed to the 
decrease  in interest expenditure. 56
Although German credit institutions managed 
to slightly improve their net interest income in 
2021 as against the previous year, the interest 
margin (net interest income in the broader 
sense in relation to annual average total assets) 
fell by 0.01 percentage point to the new low of 
0.87% in the reporting year. The dampening 
effect of balance sheet growth on the interest margin proved to be twice as large as the posi -
tive effect that the increase in net interest in -
come had on the interest margin. In the case of 
savings banks and credit cooperatives, whose 
business models are shaped by interest- related 
business in particular, the declines seen in inter -
est margins of 0.16  percentage point and 
0.09  percentage point respectively were, in 
fact, largely driven by strong balance sheet 
growth. At the same time, interest income in 
the narrower sense decreased again in both 
categories of banks despite the strong expan -
sion of lending. Nevertheless, savings banks 
and credit cooperatives continued to record 
the highest interest margins among all categor -
ies of banks under review in 2021, at 1.31% 
and 1.47% respectively, even though these 
were new lows in both cases.
Net commission income increased by €5.8 bil -
lion (+17.9%) on the year to €37.9 billion. Both

53 In its Annual Report for 2021, the Bundesbank reported 
interest income from negatively remunerated deposits by 
German banks in the deposit facility amounting to €4.8 bil -
lion (previous year: €2.7 billion). This figure already takes 
into account the deposit facility’s two- tier remuneration 
system. The sharp rise, which is likely to have been re -
flected in higher interest expenditure at German banks, 
was due to a 73% increase in negatively remunerated hold -
ings in the deposit facility. See Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022a), pp. 71ff.
54 In 2021, German credit institutions made greater use of 
TLTRO- III than in 2020, using it to generate interest income 
of €4.0 billion (previous year: €1.8 billion), as outlined in 
the Bundesbank’s Annual Report for 2021. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022a), pp. 71ff.
55 According to the MFI interest rate statistics, the average 
interest rate on new overnight deposits from non- financial 
corporations was -0.09% in December 2020. In December 
of the reporting year, this figure had already reached 
-0.14%. The average interest rate on new overnight de -
posits from retail customers was virtually zero in December 
2020, moving into negative territory for the first time in 
February 2021, and standing at -0.01% in December 2021.

terms and conditions in deposit business lowered interest

Change in German banks’ interest expenditure caused by 
adjustments to terms and conditions in deposit business 
with non- banks in the 2021 calendar year
In terms of content and methodology, the 
following analysis is based on the box en-
titled “Change in German banks’ interest 
expenditure caused by adjustments to 
terms and conditions in deposit business 
with non- banks in the 2020 calendar year”, 
which was included in the September 2021 
Monthly Report as part of the article on the 
performance of German credit institutions 
in 2020. In the context of the negative 
interest rate environment prevailing since 
2014, this box will estimate the amount by 
which German banks used adjustments to 
terms and conditions in deposit business to 
lower their interest expenditure during cal-
endar year 2021 compared with the previ-
ous year. All deposits held by non- banks 
(non- MFIs) are included in the analysis. 
Other effects of negative interest rates on 
banks’ interest expenditure and interest in-
come as well as on all other income and ex-
penditure items are disregarded, however. 
The following analysis therefore does not 
allow a conclusive assessment of the overall 
effect of negative interest rates on banks’ 
profi  tability.1
The table on p. 85 summarises the results 
of the calculations. Compared with 2020, 
interest expenditure in deposit business is 
likely to have fallen by an estimated €1.6 
billion in 2021. The decline was almost 20% 
larger than in the previous year (-€1.3 bil-
lion), with residents’ deposit business again 
accounting for the lion’s share of the reduc-
tion, at around €1.4 billion. Interest ex-
penditure in business with non- resident de-
positors dropped by just under €0.2 billion 
on the year.In 2021, the decline in interest expenditure 
was greater than in 2020 in almost all de-
posit categories. As in the previous year, 
German banks reduced their interest ex-
penditure on sight deposits and time de-
posits in particular during the reporting 
year. At €0.6 billion, the fall in interest ex-
penditure on sight deposits was up by a 
relatively moderate amount (around 10%) 
on the previous year’s fi  gure, while the de-
crease in interest expenditure on time de-
posits, at just over €0.8 billion, was around 
40% higher than in 2020. Only in the case 
of savings deposits and long- term time de-
posits held by non- fi  nancial corporations 
and non- resident depositors did interest ex-
penditure decline more slowly than in the 
previous year.
Once again, the introduction and/ or expan-
sion of negative deposit rates also had an 
impact on overall developments. Around 
half of the total reduction in interest ex-
penditure was achieved through (increas-
ingly) negative average interest rates on de-
posits. In addition to the increase in the 
negative average interest rate on short- term 
time deposits, in 2021 this was probably 
partly due, in particular, to the interest on 
households’ sight deposits. The latter had 
moved closer and closer to the zero mark 
up until January 2021, but remained in posi-
tive territory. From February 2021 onwards, 
however, consistently negative average 
interest rates on households’ sight deposits 
were observed for the fi  rst time, and these 
expanded over the course of the year.

The fall of around €1.6 billion in interest ex-
penditure in deposit business also more 
than offset the net interest expenditure 
caused by the negative interest rates on the 
deposit facility in the 2021 calendar year, to 
a greater extent than in 2020. Net interest 
expenditure is calculated as interest ex-
penditure from remuneration of excess 
liquidity less interest income from participa-
tion in the negatively remunerated targeted 
longer- term refi  nancing operations (TLTRO- 
III). It fell by around 20% to €0.8 billion in 
the 2021 calendar year.2
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a), pp. 71ff. Accord-
ing to data in the Bundesbank’s Annual Report for 
2021, German banks are likely to have incurred interest 
expenses of €4.8 billion from the negative remuner-
ation of the balances in the deposit facility (previous 
year: €2.7 billion). This fi  gure already takes into ac-
count the deposit facility’s two- tier remuneration sys-
tem. In the same period, German credit institutions 
generated interest income of €4.0 billion from partici-
pation in TLTRO- III (previous year: €1.8 billion). At €0.8 
billion on balance, German banks’ direct net interest 
expenditure incurred through negative interest rates 
on the deposit facility is thus likely to be 20% lower in 
2021 than in the previous year (2020: €1.0 billion).Change in interest expenditure* in existing deposit business with the

than in 2020. The role of net commission in -
come as the second most important source of 
income after net interest income thus con -
tinued to grow. In addition, net commission in -
come in 2021 was well above the long- term 
average of €28.6 billion. The main drivers of 
growth across all categories of banks were 
strong growth in securities and deposit busi -
ness with customers, in payments, in brokerage 
business and in asset management, but also in 
fees for services.
In contrast to the previous year, developments 
in 2021 were very consistent when comparing 
the categories of banks. With the exception of 
branches of foreign banks and mortgage 
banks, all categories of banks57 substantially in -
creased their net commission income. Regional 
banks and other commercial banks, in particu -
lar, recorded high growth rates (+41.4%). Al -
though this category of banks only generated a 
little less than one- quarter of total net commis -
sion income, it accounted for just over 40% of the overall increase in net commission income. 
Brexit banks once again proved to be the major 
driver of this development, as their business 
models are geared more towards commission- 
based activities than those of most other banks 
in Germany.
By contrast, the savings banks and credit co -
operatives made disproportionately small con -
tributions to the increase in aggregate net 
commission income, with comparatively minor 
improvements in their individual net commis -
sion income (+6.7% and +8.5%, respectively). 
Savings banks generated just under one-  
quarter of total net commission income, but 
contributed only around 10% to the overall in -
crease. Credit cooperatives contributed around 
8% to the overall increase, although their share Interest received and interest paid by credit institutions

in aggregate net commission income came to 
about 16%.
Following its decline in 2020, the commission 
margin (net commission income in relation to 
annual average total assets) rose by 0.05 per -
centage point to 0.40% in the reporting year, 
outstripping the long- term average of 0.35%. 
Growth in annual average total assets again 
had a dampening effect on the commission 
margin in the reporting year, but unlike in the 
previous year, the positive effect of the sharp 
rise in net commission income was the domin -
ant factor.
A comparison of the various categories of 
banks, however, revealed mixed developments. 
Commission margins were seen to increase, in 
particular, at big banks (+0.11 percentage point) 
and regional banks and other commercial 
banks (+0.07 percentage point). Just under half 
of the sharp increase in the case of big banks 
was attributable to annual average total assets 
declining steeply. By contrast, the strong bal -
ance sheet growth at regional banks and other 
commercial banks ate up around two- thirds of 
the increase in the commission margin due to 
the higher net commission income.
At savings banks and credit cooperatives, bal -
ance sheet growth likewise had a dampening 
effect on the increase in the commission mar -
gin. Despite higher net commission income, 
the commission margin of credit cooperatives 
remained unchanged at the previous year’s 
level; savings banks recorded a slight decline in 
the commission margin of 0.01  percentage 
point.
The net result from the trading portfolio rose 
by €1.4 billion (+40.3%) on the year in 2021 
and, at €4.9 billion, was well above the long-  
term average of €3.6 billion. As a result, the 
share of operating income accounted for by 
the trading result also grew to just under 4% 
(previous year: just under 3%). In addition, the 
trading result in the reporting year was more 
than four times as large as the other operating result, after both had been at the same level in 
2020.
As in previous years, the trading result was still 
primarily relevant for big banks, regional banks 
and other commercial banks as well as Landes -
banken. While the trading result of the big 
banks stayed at the previous year’s level, re -
gional banks and other commercial banks 
proved to be the main drivers of overall growth 
in the reporting year. Owing to business reloca -
tions in the wake of Brexit, they more than 
doubled their trading result for the second time 
in a row, boosting it by €0.9 billion to €1.5 bil -
lion. They also generated the second- highest 
trading result after the big banks and were thus 
still ahead of the Landesbanken, which likewise 
almost doubled their result from the previous 
year, at €0.9 billion. Together, these three cat -
egories of banks generated just under 90% of 
the overall trading result.Overall, commis -

The other operating result58 declined by more 
than two- thirds (-€2.5 billion) to €1.2 billion in 
2021. The share of operating income ac -
counted for by the other operating result thus 
fell to below 1% in the reporting year. This de -
cline was attributable almost exclusively to big 
banks, whose other operating result was down 
by €2.9 billion year on year. This was chiefly 
due to net expenditure arising from the 
marking- up of provisions for pensions and 
other post- employment benefit obligations.
Unlike in 2019 and 2020, the balance in the 
other and extraordinary account59 in the re -
porting year was only of minor importance for 
the increase in the aggregate profit for the 
financial year. Despite a significant improve -
ment of almost 40% (in absolute terms: +€2.3 
billion), in 2021 the balance in the other and 
extraordinary account made a comparatively 
small contribution to growth in aggregate 
profit for the financial year. The improvement 
was also driven mainly by a higher valuation of 
participating interests at one institution belong -
ing to the big banks category.

stable year on year at just under 51%.61 Amongst 
other things, higher social security contribu -
tions and restructuring expenses for early re -
tirement schemes or severance payments led to 
the increase in staff costs. The increase in other 
administrative spending was primarily attribut -
able to IT and digitalisation costs. However, higher expenditure in connection with the 
European bank levy and the statutory deposit 
guarantee fund also had an impact on other 
administrative spending. In addition, intangible 
assets were amortised heavily in some cases.
Cost efficiency
Measured by the cost/ income ratio in its broad 
definition (administrative spending relative to 
operating income), German credit institutions’ 
cost efficiency deteriorated slightly in 2021. 
Despite higher operating income, the rise in 
administrative spending led to a year- on- year 
increase in the cost/ income ratio of 0.6  per -
centage point to 72.9%. The cost/ income ratio 
thus remained well above the long- term aver -
age of 68.2%.
In a comparison of the categories of banks, big 
banks recorded the largest deterioration in the 
cost/ income ratio, with an increase of 8.9 per -
centage points compared with the previous 
year. Here, the sharp rise in administrative 
spending was responsible for around three-  
quarters of the increase; around one- quarter 
was caused by the decline in operating income. 
At 99.2%, the big banks also continued to re -
cord the highest cost/ income ratio across all 
categories of banks. Savings banks’ cost/ in-
come ratio deteriorated by 0.7  percentage 
point, even though their administrative spend -
ing remained virtually unchanged as against 
2020. In their case, the change in the cost/  
income  ratio in the reporting year was caused 
almost exclusively by the decline in operating 
income. By contrast, credit cooperatives im -
proved their cost/ income ratio by 1.3 percent -
age points in 2021, as their operating income 
rose more than their administrative spending.

61 Comparing the categories of banks under analysis, the 
share of staff costs at savings banks (around 61%) and at 
credit cooperatives (around 57%) remained above average 
in the reporting year owing to their heavily staff-  based 
business model with many branches nationwide. At big 
banks, by contrast, staff costs accounted for a share of 
around 43%.Deutsche Bundesbank

Estimation of the effect of an interest rate reversal on the 
interest margin of German credit institutions
Given the current interest rate reversal, the 
following is an estimation of the impact of 
an interest rate hike on the interest margin 
of German banks. It does not, however, in-
clude a comprehensive quantifi  cation of the 
overall effect on banks’ profi  tability; for ex-
ample, derivative interest rate hedges are 
not taken into account. Nor does it include 
an assessment of any need for write- downs 
that may arise from price losses on secur-
ities held for banks’ own accounts.
For the purposes of the estimation, an inter-
est rate shock in the form of an unexpected 
parallel shift in the yield curve by +2% is as-
sumed. This is consistent with the Basel 
interest rate shock scenario, which banking 
supervisors regularly use to measure banks’ 
interest rate risk.1 The central data for the 
analysis consists of the balance sheet and 
maturity structure of each institution as ap-
proximated using the monthly balance 
sheet statistics as at the reporting date of 
31  December 2021.2 This is then used to 
calculate the change in an institution’s 
interest margin in the fi  rst, second and third 
years after the interest rate increase. A con-
stant balance sheet structure is assumed 
here. If a transaction expires within the 
three- year observation period, it is fully re-
placed by a similar transaction – under new 
conditions – in the same month it expired. 
Furthermore, as per the empirical evidence, 
it is assumed that banks pass on the interest 
rate increase in lending business in full, but 
pass it on only partially in deposit business 
with non- banks.3
The effect of relief arising from the cessa-
tion of negative remuneration on banks’ 
central bank balances is not modelled. 
Therefore, the results are only suitable for interpreting interest rate increases above 
the zero lower bound on interest rates 
reached by the policy rate as a result of the 
monetary policy decisions of 21 July 2022. 
When classifying the results, it should also 
be borne in mind that interest rate increases 
are anticipated by the markets and banks, 
which can lead to a steeper, fl  atter or 
humped yield curve. Compared with the 
unexpected parallel shift, a steeper curve is 
likely to generally mitigate the negative im-
pact on earnings, while a fl  atter curve could 
amplify said impact. On the whole, how-
ever, the present assessment is likely to be 
considered conservative.
The chart on p. 92 summarises the results 
of the analysis by showing the change in 
the interest margin from its baseline as at 
31 December 2021.4
Overall, the majority of institutions would 
suffer only small reductions in the interest 
margin in the short term. In the medium 
term, however, an interest rate reversal 
should have a marked positive impact on 
the interest margin of German banks across 
the board, as the proportion of higher- 
yielding claims in the banking book is likely 
to gradually increase and rising market 
interest rates are liable to only partially be 
passed on to depositors.

4 Here, the balance sheet value as at 31 December 
2021 is used instead of the annual average total assets 
when calculating the interest margin. The reason for 
this is that the change in net interest income was esti-
mated for a balance sheet structure that had remained 
constant since the end of 2021.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2022

According to the results of the analysis, the 
short- term impact on the interest margin of 
individual banks is nevertheless heteroge-
neous. Although the interest margin of the 
aggregate of German banks already rises by 
around 0.08 percentage point in the fi  rst 
year after the interest rate hike, interest 
margins actually fall at around 60% of insti-
tutions. For just under 30% of institutions, 
the decline in the interest margin would be 
stronger than the decline in the aggregate 
interest margin in the business environment 
of 2020, which was shaped by the corona-
virus pandemic.5 A signifi  cant decline in the 
interest margin of more than 0.20 percent-
age point6 would be expected at only 
around 1% of institutions.
The heterogeneity of the short- term impact 
of an interest rate reversal is also evident at 
the bank category level. The analysis shows 
less than 5% of commercial banks and one- 
third of Landesbanken experiencing falling 
interest margins in the fi  rst year, compared 
with three- quarters of credit cooperatives 
and two- thirds of savings banks, along with 
around half of the remaining institutions.
In the medium term, however, the interest 
margin of German institutions is likely to benefi  t from an interest rate increase. Just 
over 90% of institutions would see positive 
effects in the second year after the interest 
rate hike (almost all institutions in the third 
year). The increase in the aggregate interest 
margin of all banks would amount to 
around 0.13 percentage point in the second 
year after the interest rate shock (0.19 per-
centage point in the third year).
5 In 2020, the aggregate interest margin fell by 
0.09 percentage point on the year.
6 This corresponds to just under one- quarter of the 
annual average interest margin in 2021.Change in the interest margin

Outlook
This year, numerous developments are having 
an impact on the business environment for 
German credit institutions. Uncertainty sur -
rounding the economic setting is increasing for 
now. The elimination of most coronavirus miti -
gation measures lent a strong boost to service 
providers, which had been hit particularly hard 
by them, and to the attendant consumption 
expenditure.62 However, economic develop -
ments are increasingly being affected by the 
impact of the Russian war of aggression on 
Ukraine. The main adverse factors here are 
high commodity prices, severe trade restric -
tions due, amongst other things, to sanctions 
and countermeasures, and potential energy 
shortages.63 If the economic environment de -
teriorates further, this could also weigh on the 
profitability of German banks, through higher 
credit losses for example. Additionally, high in -
flation and the level of uncertainty, particularly 
with regard to the energy supply, are major 
burdens on enterprises and households64 and 
could ultimately increase counterparty credit 
risk by way of reduced debt servicing capacity.
Furthermore, the ECB has changed its monet -
ary policy stance in view of already high infla -
tion rates and further increases in inflation ex -
pectations. Net purchases under the PEPP and 
the APP were discontinued at the end of March 
2022 and end of June 2022 respectively, and the interest rate reversal commenced with the 
interest rate decision of 21 July 2022. However, 
the continued reinvestment of freed up funds 
from the purchase programmes is intended to 
ensure, amongst other things, that banks have 
sufficient liquidity. Although the rising interest 
rate level could weigh on German banks’ 
profitability  in the short term, the earnings-  
enhancing effects of monetary policy normal -
isation are likely to bolster the performance of 
German institutions in the medium term.65
The profitability of German institutions will 
probably also continue to be affected by struc -
tural changes in future. Besides investment in 
digitalisation, investments made with climate 
considerations in mind will increasingly pose a 
major challenge for the sector. The ECB’s cli -
mate stress test showed that German banks are 
likely to cope with transition risks, but even 
though German institutions performed com -
paratively well, climate risks need to be ad -
dressed in more depth overall. The extent to 
which climate- related investment also offers 
growth opportunities for banks thus remains to 
be seen.Business envir -

The role of the International Monetary 
Fund in preventing and managing crises
As a global financial institution, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays a key role in shap -
ing international monetary cooperation. It contributes to the stability of the global monetary and 
financial system by working with its member countries, providing either policy advice or, if 
required, financial assistance to help prevent and manage economic and financial crises.
In order to be prepared for future developments, the IMF continually reviews its policies. It often 
faces high expectations in an environment that is in constant flux and shaped by politics. At the 
same time, it is confronted with the challenge of how to meet these expectations within the 
framework of its mandate.
This article outlines the IMF’s key tasks in crisis prevention and management. In addition, it dis -
cusses the organisation’s financial resources and Germany’s membership, the 70th anniversary of 
which was this year.
As the fourth largest member of the IMF, Germany is actively committed to international monet -
ary cooperation and supports the IMF in its work, with the Bundesbank discharging its legally 
mandated tasks. Besides exercising the financial rights and obligations arising from Germany’s 
membership, these tasks also include the Bundesbank’s involvement in Germany’s representation 
in the IMF.Deutsche Bundesbank

Major waypoints
The IMF was established as an international 
financial organisation in 1944 at the United 
Nations conference in Bretton Woods, New 
Hampshire, United States, a gathering of dele -
gates from 45 nations. It began its operations 
in 1946, after a sufficient number of countries 
had ratified the IMF Articles of Agreement, 
thereby accepting the IMF’s objectives, the 
rules for international monetary cooperation 
and the new international monetary system, as 
well as the resulting obligations. Germany 
joined the IMF  70 years ago, on 14  August 
1952.1
At the end of the 1960s, there were concerns 
that the fixed exchange rate regime in place at 
that time would no longer be able to function 
properly in the event of a global shortage of re -
serve assets. As a result, the IMF was em -
powered to create what are known as special 
drawing rights (SDRs) as a reserve asset and 
allocate  them to its members (see the box on 
pp. 109 ff.).
One of the biggest changes to occur was the 
comprehensive reform of the international 
monetary system in the 1970s. This involved 
the transition from a monetary system of fixed 
exchange rates against the US dollar, which 
was pegged to gold, to a system of monetary 
cooperation without a gold peg and in which 
members were free to choose their own ex -
change rate regimes. However, they remained 
obliged to work with the IMF to safeguard or -
derly exchange rate arrangements and support 
a stable exchange rate regime.
Germany joined the IMF in 1952 as its 53rd 
member. Over the years, membership has 
grown to 190, making the IMF a truly global in -
stitution. This is one of the main reasons why 
the IMF is able to play an effective role in pro -
moting international monetary cooperation. At 
the same time, global stability is strengthened 
by the fact that many countries have accepted 
the rules enshrined in the IMF Articles of Agree -ment and the rights and obligations that come 
with membership.
The substantial expansion of IMF membership 
has also brought with it a sharply growing 
number of members classified as developing or 
low- income countries,2 which are confronted 
with economic policy challenges that, in part, 
differ in nature from those faced by advanced 
economies, for example. Low- income countries 
currently make up more than one- third of IMF 
members. Their increasing importance is shap -
ing the IMF’s role and policies, as reflected in, 
amongst other things, the establishment of 
trust funds providing concessional financing for 
this group of countries. Resources for these 
trust funds are mobilised from members on a 
voluntary basis and are managed separately 
from the IMF’s own resources (see also the box 
on pp. 126 ff.).
Financial crises – such as the Asian crisis at the 
end of the 1990s, the global financial crisis of 
2008 and the European debt crisis of the early 
2010s – as well as various regional debt crises 
pose constant challenges to the IMF. Within 
the scope of its mandate, it provides its mem -
bers with assistance in addressing these chal -
lenges in the form of tried and tested, modified 
or new instruments. The IMF responded swiftly 
and decisively to the COVID-19 pandemic, too, 
significantly stepping up financial assistance to 
support its members. In addition, it is grappling 
with the far- reaching economic fallout of the 
Russian war of aggression against Ukraine due 
to the global disruptions it has caused, which 
are placing heavy burdens on many, especially 
poorer, countries. As a global institution, it is an Founding con -

Now, ten years later, this article takes a fresh look at the

member countries that are classified by the IMF as eligible 
for access to concessional financing. The IMF’s most recent

Special drawing rights and their use
In the 1960s, concerns increasingly emerged 
about the future functioning of the inter-
national monetary system due to a possible 
global shortage of reserve assets. There 
were fears that such a shortage could occur, 
in particular, in the event of an insuffi   cient 
US current account defi  cit in the Bretton 
Woods global gold- dollar- based monetary 
system of fi  xed exchange rates (1944-73). It 
was assumed that in such a situation coun-
tries would no longer be able to generate 
enough US dollars through their foreign 
trade to fi  nance imports and the shortage 
of foreign exchange would subsequently 
force them to take restrictive measures. 
These are considered harmful to global eco-
nomic prosperity.1 In order to address these 
feared risks to the international monetary 
system and to the global economy, the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) was, 
with the fi  rst amendment to its Articles of 
Agreement in 1969, granted the right to 
create special drawing rights (SDRs) as a 
reserve  instrument and to allocate them to 
its members. SDRs can only be allocated to 
all member countries at the same time.2 
The allocations are distributed to individual 
members in proportion to their quota, which 
is reviewed on a regular basis.3
SDRs are not a currency in the usual sense, 
as they cannot be used as a general means 
of payment. A country may exchange them 
for currencies classifi  ed as freely usable by 
the IMF4 and they can be used to carry out 
transactions with the IMF.
Since SDRs were introduced, the concerns 
about a global shortage of reserve assets 
have proved largely unfounded.5 Moreover, 
with fl  exible exchange rates, for which 
many countries opted after the end of the 
Bretton Woods global monetary system,6 interventions to stabilise the exchange rate 
were no longer an economic policy priority. 
The long- term and global need to supple-
ment existing reserve assets, as defi  ned in 
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement as a condi-
tion for new SDR allocations, has conse-
quently been established only rarely and to 
a limited extent.7 New SDR allocations were 
made only in connection with the global 
fi  nancial crisis as of 2008 and most recently 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. These allo-
cations to 190 members at last count were 
signifi  cantly higher than previous ones 
(2009: SDR 161.2 billion; 2021: SDR 456.6 
billion). The focus was placed for all prac-
tical purposes on efforts to provide add-
itional fi  nancial assistance to low- income 
1 For an SDR allocation, the IMF’s Articles of Agree-
ment require that there is a long- term global need to 
supplement existing reserve assets and that an alloca-
tion does not contribute to excess demand and infl  a-
tion in the world. The IMF’s Articles of Agreement also 
provide for the possibility of cancelling SDRs based on 
these considerations. See International Monetary Fund 
(2016), Art. XVIII Section 1(a).
2 Through an amendment to the IMF’s Articles of 
Agreement in 1998, an exceptional “equity allocation” 
of SDRs was agreed to those countries that had joined 
the IMF after previous allocations and had therefore 
not yet received any SDRs.
3 Each member country receives a quota expressed in 
SDRs. The quota refl  ects the member’s relative position 
in the world economy. It determines the capital contri-
bution a country is obliged to make to the IMF and the 
share it receives in an SDR allocation, as well as deter-
mining the member’s voting power within the IMF.
4 These are currently fi  ve currencies which are simul-
taneously part of the basket of currencies on which 
the value or exchange rate of the SDR is based: US dol-
lar, euro, renminbi, yen, and pound sterling. The IMF 
regularly reviews the composition and weighting of 
the currencies in the SDR basket of currencies.
5 See, for example, Bordo and McCauley (2017), p. 7, 
James (1996), p. 173, and Hauptmann (1977), p. 35.
6 The reform of the international monetary system 
was formalised by the second amendment to the IMF’s 
Articles of Agreement in 1978 and leaves members 
free to choose their exchange rate regime.
7 The fi  rst SDR allocation of SDR 9.3 billion was made 
from 1970 to 1972 to the 115 member states at that 
time. A second allocation of SDR 12.1 billion was made 
from 1979 to 1982 to then around 140 members. A 
cancellation of SDRs, which the IMF’s Articles of 
Agreement also allow for, has not occurred so far.Deutsche Bundesbank

countries and emerging market economies, 
which were hit particularly hard by the cri-
sis. In so doing, the de facto expansion of 
the purpose of SDRs as defi  ned in the IMF 
Articles of Agreement towards a develop-
ment and emergency fi  nancing instrument 
for a section of its membership was con-
ceded.
The fact that the SDR allocation in August 
2021 was coupled to the fi  nancing needs of 
low- income countries during the crisis is be-
cause SDRs can be used ﬂ  exibly. From an 
economic point of view, an SDR allocation8 
is comparable to granting members an 
overdraft facility.9 Unlike IMF fi  nancial assis-
tance, there are no economic policy condi-
tions or fi  xed repayment schedules when 
making use of allocated SDRs. While the ex-
tent to which individual countries use allo-
cated SDRs can be traced retrospectively via 
IMF statistics, information on the type of 
use is based on voluntary disclosure by 
member countries.10 The value of SDR trans-
actions must be reported to the IMF or the 
transactions are brokered by the IMF; it is 
not necessary to explain their purpose. In 
addition, SDR allocations can give rise to 
fi  nancial transactions without an exchange 
of SDRs being observable: following a new 
SDR allocation, for example, a country can 
retain its SDR holdings and reduce existing 
foreign exchange reserves instead; other 
countries will use an SDR allocation as col-
lateral in order to expand the monetary 
fi  nancing of government by the central 
bank.
The information available so far, however, 
can be used for an initial assessment of the 
SDR allocation carried out in 2021: how 
many and which countries reduced their 
SDR holdings following the allocation and 
presumably also used them to fi  nance the 
balance of payments?11 In the fi  rst nine 
months following the allocation, only a limited number of IMF member countries 
already signifi  cantly reduced their newly al-
located SDRs, i.e. exchanged them or used 
them for payments to the IMF. Up to April 
2022, a total of 38 low- income and emer-
ging market economies reduced their SDR 
holdings by at least 50% of the newly 
allocated  SDRs.12 Countries in this group 
share a number of common features. One 
particularly striking aspect is the over- 
representation of emerging market econ-
omies with high risks to their debt sustain-
ability and with a loss of market access, 
along with countries suffering acute debt 
crises. Well over half of the emerging mar-
ket economies in the group fall into one of 
these categories. Of the low- income coun-
tries, more than 60% are exposed to high 
debt risk or fi  nd themselves in an acute 
debt crisis. However, the strong use of SDRs 
by countries with unsustainable external 
debt potentially conﬂ  icts with the general 
recommendations of the IMF, which advise 
members not to use the policy space pro-
8 Each SDR allocation involves the transfer of the SDR 
holdings and an equivalent liability to the IMF. This is 
because SDRs can be cancelled by the IMF and must 
be returned if a country leaves the IMF. Therefore, al-
though an SDR allocation increases a country’s gross 
foreign reserves, net foreign reserves remain un-
changed. However, in the net international reserves 
statistics the SDR liability is treated as a long- term 
liability item and is therefore not taken into account in 
some cases.
9 A country’s SDR holdings decline when it uses SDRs. 
If a member’s SDR holdings are below its allocations, 
the IMF charges interest on the difference at the SDR 
interest rate. If SDR holdings are greater than alloca-
tions, the country receives the SDR interest rate on the 
difference from the IMF. The SDR interest rate is based 
on the money market rates of the fi  ve currencies in the 
SDR basket (US dollar, euro, renminbi, yen, and pound 
sterling) and currently stands at 1.566% (as at 1 Sep-
tember 2022).
10 The IMF collects and summarises this information 
as part of its bilateral surveillance. See International 
Monetary Fund (2022e).
11 It is also conceivable that a country exchanges SDRs 
in order to optimise the composition of its own reserve 
assets in terms of interest income or exchange rate 
risk.
12 Countries usually drew on funds quickly following 
the allocation at the end of August 2021, in the subse-
quent months in most cases. 26 of the 38 countries 
have already used at least 90% of their SDR allocation.Deutsche Bundesbank

important part of the multilateral world eco -
nomic order. Its contribution to rules- based 
cross- country cooperation in the global monet -
ary system is vital for prosperity.
The global economic situation, the inter -
national monetary system and the IMF’s pol -
icies have changed in many ways since it was 
established. The mandate and core elements of 
the institutional structure, as well as the special 
characteristics of the IMF as a monetary institu -
tion, have remained largely unchanged. This 
offers the IMF numerous, albeit not unlimited, 
ways in which to support its members. Over 
time, the IMF has continually refined and en -
hanced its policies, particularly in the areas of 
economic policy advice and surveillance, as 
well as in the way that financial assistance is 
provided and structured. This, as well as the 
IMF’s financial resources and the role of Ger -
many and the Bundesbank in the IMF, will be 
discussed in the following sections of this art -
icle on the basis of selected factors.The IMF’s economic policy 
advice
As a multilateral institution, the IMF is a stabil -
ising force for the global economy. It is often 
called upon to respond quickly to sudden chal -
lenges in member countries and to support 
them within the framework of its mandate. 
One of the IMF’s most important tasks is crisis 
prevention through economic and financial 
policy surveillance. Compared with the finan -
cial assistance it provides, this task is often less 
firmly in the public eye.
Since the establishment of the IMF, the global 
monetary and financial system has been con -
stantly changing and evolving. The IMF has re -
peatedly responded to these changes by modi -
fying its policies and strategic direction. Over 
the past decade, the world economic environ -
ment and international challenges have under -
gone further transformation: the increasing 
dangers of climate change have become more … required IMF 
to evolveIMF as a stabilis -
ing element …
… in a chan -
ging global 
monetary and 
financial systemvided by the allocation to delay any debt re-
structuring needed, not to pursue unsus-
tainable macroeconomic policies or post-
pone necessary macroeconomic adjust-
ments and reforms.13 Like the requirement 
that IMF loans should be utilised as effi   -
ciently as possible, these recommendations 
make sense as, in economic terms, levels of 
SDR holdings below allocations bear simi-
larities to an external foreign currency debt 
with a variable interest rate and without a 
fi  xed maturity.
A more comprehensive assessment of the 
SDR allocation of August 2021 will be pos-
sible once the IMF has presented its own 
evaluations. A critical view of SDR alloca-
tions would be warranted, in particular, if 
countries postpone necessary reforms in 
the face of the sudden availability of liquid-
ity. It should also be noted that it is not pos-
sible to allocate SDRs in a targeted manner and the use of SDR holdings results in an 
interest burden; this may place additional 
strain on low- income countries that would 
benefi  t more from concessional fi  nancing 
and grants.

of a policy focus and require a global, coopera -
tive solution. Digitalisation efforts have pro -
gressed, private crypto tokens have emerged 
and many central banks are working to de -
velop central bank digital currencies. Emerging 
market economies have continued to catch up 
economically, albeit unevenly. Despite a slight 
decline since the 2008 financial crisis, cross-  
border capital flows remain large. These can 
trigger positive effects in recipient countries, 
impacting on growth, economic development 
and stability, for example, but they also entail 
risks. Abrupt capital outflows can pose a threat 
to macroeconomic stability and the stability of 
the financial system, especially in emerging 
market economies with limited resilience. 
Moreover, the increasing debt held by many 
countries has reached worrying levels in the 
last few years. The COVID-19 pandemic and, 
most recently, the Russian war of aggression 
against Ukraine have shown how global eco -
nomic disruptions and burdens can emerge 
and existing vulnerabilities can be exacerbated 
in a very short space of time.
Crisis prevention: the IMF’s 
core task
The IMF’s surveillance activities are carried out 
with the overarching objective of promoting 
the development and stability of the inter -
national monetary and financial system, thereby 
preventing crises. In this context, the IMF bene -
fits from its role and experience as a global in -
stitution. Under the IMF Articles of Agreement, 
all 190 members are required to undergo regu -
lar, usually annual, Article IV consultations3 in 
which their economic policies are assessed for 
compliance with the objectives outlined in the 
Articles. Based on an in- depth analysis of a 
country’s economic developments and policies, 
the IMF prepares a report containing economic 
policy recommendations. The rationale behind 
this “bilateral surveillance” is that the economic 
policies of one country may have an impact on 
other members. The best way to promote 
global stability is therefore to ensure that all members pursue a stability- oriented economic 
policy at home and, in doing so, contribute to 
the stability of the international economic and 
financial system.
In addition to this regular surveillance for all 
members, the IMF pays particular attention to 
the economic policies of those countries that 
have agreed on a credit programme for the 
purpose of resolving balance of payments 
problems. In such cases, the IMF assesses the 
implementation of agreed reforms. This intensi -
fied level of surveillance may continue follow -
ing the completion of a credit programme 
(post- programme monitoring). Separately from 
the provision of financial assistance, too, the 
IMF has tools with which it can more closely 
monitor countries’ economic policies on an ad -
visory or programme basis. These tools include 
Staff Monitored Programs (SMPs), the Policy 
Coordination Instrument (PCI), the Policy Sup -
port Instrument (PSI) and the Debt Sustainabil -
ity Framework (DSF) developed specifically for 
low- income countries, which analyses the debt 
sustainability of these countries.
Targeted analyses of the 
financial  system
These bilateral surveillance measures and non- 
financial programmes are complemented by 
targeted analyses of the financial system. In re -
sponse to the Asian crisis, the IMF introduced 
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) 
in 1999. The IMF and the World Bank conduct 
comprehensive and in- depth analyses of mem -
bers’ financial sectors, review the application of 
international regulatory and supervisory stand -
ards and make recommendations. In doing so, 
the IMF makes an important contribution to 
identifying and mitigating risks in the financial 
sector and to making national financial systems 
resilient and sustainable. Members with sys -Crisis prevention

temically important financial sectors – one of 
them being Germany – are required to undergo 
the FSAP every five years. Germany was re -
cently assessed and the final report published 
in mid-  July 2022 (see the box on p.  132). In 
order to improve the coordination of surveil -
lance, it was also decided that FSAP findings 
would be integrated to a greater extent into 
the annual Article IV consultations. In 2021, the 
FSAP instrument was reviewed and refined, 
amongst other things with regard to new 
macroeconomic risks related to climate change 
and digitalisation. The review also focused on 
improving the analysis of links between banks 
and financial institutions that are not part of 
the banking sector.
Multilateral surveillance
Bilateral surveillance is accompanied by multi -
lateral surveillance. The latter’s aim is to iden -
tify global risks or risks that could spill over 
from one member to other countries or to the 
global economy and to recommend contain -
ment measures. To this end, the IMF analyses 
and assesses global macroeconomic and finan -
cial sector developments.
Key instruments for multilateral surveillance are 
the World Economic Outlook, which provides 
detailed analyses of the global economic situ -
ation; the Global Financial Stability Report, 
which focuses on imbalances and vulnerabil -
ities within the global financial system; the Fis -
cal Monitor, which examines the state of mem -
bers’ public finances; and the External Sector 
Report, which assesses the external positions of 
the world’s largest economies.4 In addition, the 
IMF has been collaborating with the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB) to conduct an Early Warn -
ing Exercise (EWE) every six months since 2009. 
This is designed to identify at an early stage 
risks and undesirable developments that are 
low- probability but high- impact to the global 
economy.Periodic surveillance review
The IMF periodically reviews the framework 
and focal points of its surveillance and, if ne -
cessary, modifies them to keep up with changes 
in the global economy. The last major change 
came in the form of the Integrated Surveillance 
Decision (ISD) in 2012. After the global financial 
crisis revealed weaknesses in surveillance, vari -
ous tasks – and not least bilateral and multilat -
eral surveillance – became better coordinated. 
For example, surveillance prior to the ISD fo -
cused heavily on members’ exchange rate pol -
icies and neglected other policy areas (fiscal, 
monetary or financial stability policies) that 
could have a negative impact on other coun -
tries. An important objective of the ISD was to 
better identify and assess spillovers between 
economies. This concerns, for example, the im -
pact of monetary policy decisions by major 
central banks on emerging market economies. 
In multilateral surveillance, from then onwards 
greater focus was placed on issues that require 
coordinated policy action in order to ensure 
global stability. Financial system analysis was 
also ramped up considerably once again.
In addition to assessing and refining the surveil -
lance framework, the IMF periodically reviews 
surveillance practices. As part of the last review 
of this kind in 2021, the Comprehensive Surveil -
lance Review, several innovations were intro -
duced to improve the quality of surveillance. 
The Article IV consultations are to focus on a 
small number of topics that are considered par -
ticularly important. Cross- country analyses are 
also planned for topics that affect multiple coun -
tries at the same time. However, this approach 
entails the risks of analyses on core macroeco -
nomic issues being conducted to only a limited 
extent and of analyses potentially lacking the 
breadth necessary to provide sound advice.

that are difficult to assess – i.e. on possible de -
viations from the assumed baseline scenario – 
and to devote more attention to climate 
change (see the box on pp. 115f.) or digitalisa -
tion. A more detailed analysis of distributional 
issues is also planned.
Issues relating to international 
capital flows
International capital flows have always played a 
prominent role in the context of the IMF’s eco -
nomic policy advice. While the IMF had long 
advocated a progressive opening- up of cross-  
border capital flows, a reassessment of the 
overall advantageousness of the free move -
ment of capital began following the Asian crisis 
and intensified in the wake of the global finan -
cial crisis. The IMF subsequently developed the 
Institutional View on the Liberalization and 
Management of Capital Flows (Institutional 
View for short) as the basis for its policy advice. 
The balanced approach of the Institutional 
View attempts to combine the advantages of 
capital account liberalisation with protection 
against the disadvantages of volatile capital 
flows, e.g. by employing capital flow manage -
ment measures (see the box on pp. 118 f.).
Financial assistance from the 
IMF
While the IMF’s surveillance is crucial for crisis 
preparedness and prevention, traditional IMF 
financial assistance helps countries tackle crises 
that express themselves in the form of tempor -
arily limited access to funds in a globally ac -
cepted currency. According to the IMF Articles 
of Agreement, the purpose of temporary liquid -
ity assistance is to help countries address such 
balance of payments problems without resort -
ing to measures destructive of national or inter -
national prosperity, such as import restrictions, 
to remedy them.5 Liquidity assistance is 
financed using the IMF’s own resources. The 
IMF can use resources from the trust funds it administers for concessional financing to low-  
income countries (see the box on pp. 126 ff. for 
more information on the IMF’s financial re -
sources). The main objective of IMF pro -
grammes providing concessional financing to 
low- income countries is to achieve sustained 
progress in correcting balance of payments im -
balances. Development policy considerations 
play a role in this type of financial assistance, 
although the long- term general development 
objectives of this group of countries fall outside 
the IMF’s mandate – responsibility for render -
ing assistance in that regard rests with the 
World Bank and other multilateral develop -
ment banks as well as the United Nations.
Under the IMF Articles of Agreement, financial 
assistance is provided against adequate safe -
guards. These include, in particular, economic 
policy adjustment programmes agreed be -
tween a given country and the IMF. These con -
tain necessary modifications to monetary, fiscal 
and exchange rate policies and structural re -
forms to address the causes of balance of pay -
ments problems. The IMF’s financial assistance 
creates breathing room for these adjustment 
measures to be implemented. Successfully im -
plemented programmes usually result in the 
country returning to a sustainable external pos -
ition, winning trust on the financial markets 
and being able to repay the IMF in a timely 
manner.
Programme efficiency and 
catalytic effect
The special structure of the IMF as a monetary 
institution and fund, as well as its financing 
mechanism,6 require that financial assistance to 
countries be provided only temporarily and to a

The International Monetary Fund and climate change
Climate change is one of the greatest global 
issues of our time and presents major eco-
nomic policy challenges for all countries. 
With its near- universal membership, the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) can 
make a valuable contribution to tackling cli-
mate change and its repercussions, particu-
larly in the context of its economic surveil-
lance.
Recent years have seen the IMF steadily 
scale up its engagement on macro- critical 
aspects of climate change. These efforts 
have yielded a number of initiatives, includ-
ing analyses and recommendations on en-
ergy price subsidies as well as the IMF’s pro-
posal to implement an international carbon 
price fl  oor (ICPF), which could accelerate 
global emissions reductions, besides offer-
ing an alternative to carbon border adjust-
ment mechanisms (CBAMs).1 In addition, 
the IMF’s analytical work involves examin-
ing the measures taken by individual mem-
bers to mitigate carbon emissions and adapt 
to climate change, as well as the climate- 
related risks to fi  nancial stability.
To be even better placed to meet the chal-
lenges posed by climate change, the IMF 
presented a new climate change strategy in 
July 2021.2 This strategy aims to compre-
hensively and systematically integrate 
macro- critical aspects of climate change 
into all areas of the IMF’s economic surveil-
lance.3 One aspect is a plan to analyse and 
evaluate the emissions mitigation policies of 
the 20 largest emitters in three- year cycles 
as part of Article IV consultations. Another 
is the intention to assess country- specifi  c 
climate vulnerabilities, adaptation policies, 
and fi  nancing needs to build resilience. In 
addition to Article IV consultations, analyses 
of specifi  c challenges –  such as the fi  scal impact of recurring natural disasters – are 
planned for the countries particularly vul-
nerable to climate change as part of the 
Climate  Macroeconomic Assessment Pro-
gram (CMAP). Assessments of the impact of 
climate change on the fi  nancial sector and 
potential fi  nancial stability risks will be ex-
panded as part of Financial Sector Assess-
ment Programs (FSAPs). Cross- border issues 
will be addressed in the context of multilat-
eral surveillance. This would include, for ex-
ample, comparative analyses of the effi   -
ciency of various emissions reduction meas-
ures, such as a carbon tax or emissions trad-
ing systems. One key issue in this regard 
concerns how tax incentives and subsidies 
for fossil fuels can be scaled back or elimin-
ated without leading to economic or social 
disruptions.
The structural challenges posed by climate 
change can confront countries with longer- 
term balance of payments problems. 
Against this backdrop, the IMF Executive 
Board decided in April 2022 to set up the 
Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) as 
well as the IMF- administered Resilience and 
Sustainability Trust (RST), which will fi  nance 
the fi  nancial support provided under the 
RSF. This expands the IMF’s toolkit to in-
clude programmes with fi  nancial support 
provided at concessional terms (i.e. with 
lower interest rates) with long repayment 
periods. Access will be targeted at low- 
income countries and economically vulner-
able middle- income countries. The idea be-

sidered macro- critical if it has the potential to impact 
on a country’s internal and external economic stability

Fund (2022b).Deutsche Bundesbank

manner.7 Debt sustainability and sufficient cap -
acity to repay are key prerequisites for the ap -
proval of IMF financial assistance. The aim of 
programme- based financial assistance is to 
support countries in carrying out reforms and 
policies that are conducive to overcoming bal -
ance of payments problems and achieving ex -
ternal sustainability, accompanied by solid 
growth.8 The aim of successfully implemented 
programmes is also to avoid long- term, risk-  
bearing exposures and to limit credit augmen -
tation risk for the IMF.9 In this context, pro -
gramme efficiency refers to when these object -
ives are achieved with as little use of funds and 
as little risk as possible. This requires striking a 
balance between economic policy adjustments 
and IMF financing.
One other important concept is the “catalytic 
effect” of IMF arrangements. The catalytic ef -
fect of an IMF arrangement arises from the fact 
that the economic policy adjustment pro -
gramme agreed with the IMF strengthens con -fidence in the economic policy and stability of 
the country concerned, thus mobilising (add -
itional) financial resources from private invest -
ors, partner countries or other donors. A cata -
lytic effect is an essential prerequisite for suc -
cessful crisis management. In this way, the bal -
ance of payments can be stabilised on a lasting 
basis while at the same time minimising repay -
ment obligations to the IMF as a preferred 
creditor.10
… and catalytic 
effect of IMF 
financial 
assistance  …hind RSF programmes is to support these 
member countries in addressing structural 
challenges such as climate change or pan-
demics. Unlike traditional IMF assistance, 
the aim here is to counter prospective bal-
ance of payments problems. However, RSF 
programmes will only be able to cover a 
small part of the fi  nancing needs arising as 
a result of climate change and its mitiga-
tion. The primary objective of RSF pro-
grammes, which the IMF coordinates with 
the World Bank, is to support reforms that 
are conducive to strengthening countries’ 
resilience and to mobilise private and public 
investment in climate change and pan-
demic preparedness.4
With its enhanced economic policy advice, 
technical assistance and training, as well as 
RSF fi  nancial support, the IMF now has a 
set of tools it can deploy to help mitigate 
climate change and its repercussions, within the scope of its mandate. The Fund is cur-
rently engaged in building up the expertise 
needed to successfully implement the new 
climate change strategy. At the same time, 
there are various aspects of climate change, 
like the development of climate scenarios 
or implementation of specifi  c projects, 
which fall outside the IMF’s institutional 
role and responsibilities. This makes it cru-
cial for the IMF to cooperate closely with 
other global organisations like the World 
Bank as a means of coordinating activities 
and leveraging synergies.

10 Repayments to the IMF are protected by its preferred 
creditor status. This status is not enshrined in law but is 
nonetheless politically supported and internationally recog -
nised. It means that the IMF’s repayment claims are senior 
to the claims of all other (foreign currency) creditors. Being 
in arrears to the IMF is problematic for a country, as this 
usually results in that country being excluded from external 
financing. See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2012).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

Adequate programme efficiency and the un -
folding catalytic effect of financial assistance 
are essential for a country to meet its financial 
obligations to the IMF on time and under its 
own economic power. This is ultimately the 
basis for the IMF’s financial integrity.11
Assistance without programme 
conditionality increasing
The size and design of IMF financial assistance 
have changed considerably over time. For ex -
ample, over the past ten years, a trend has 
been observed in favour of newly created, pre -
cautionary credit facilities and more flexible 
emergency assistance not tied to the condition -
ality of an IMF programme. Programme- based 
financial assistance, by contrast, has become 
relatively less important. In addition, the IMF 
significantly expanded the size and number of 
its financial assistance arrangements during the 
COVID-  19 pandemic. The recipients were 
mostly low- income countries that received 
programme- based financial assistance and 
emergency financial assistance from trust funds 
managed by the IMF.
Crisis response during the 
COVID-  19 pandemic
The IMF responded swiftly and decisively to the 
COVID-  19 pandemic, significantly stepping up 
financial assistance to support its members. Be -
tween March 2020 and the end of 2021, al -
most one in two members of the IMF – 90 
countries – received assistance totalling around 
SDR 123 billion.12 One unique feature here is 
that the IMF responded by providing a broad 
range of emergency assistance13 that did not 
require programme arrangements subject to 
economic policy conditionality. A total of 76 
countries have drawn on such emergency assis -
tance. In addition, the IMF granted almost 
SDR 690 million to 31 low- income countries to 
finance IMF repayments due during the pan -
demic. These grants were drawn from the Ca -tastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT)14 
managed by the IMF.
Emergency assistance has provided rapid sup -
port to many member countries. This helped to 
cushion considerable balance of payments bur -
dens in developing and emerging market econ -
omies at the beginning of the pandemic in par -
ticular. However, IMF resources, which were 
paid out as direct budget support, often con -
tributed to the funding of burgeoning budget 
deficits and, given the lack of conditionality, 
could also be used to support unsustainable fis -
cal or exchange rate policies. The majority of 
the countries applying for emergency assis -
tance in 2020 and 2021 received the maximum 
amount possible, with the access limits tem -
porarily increased as a result of the crisis.15
The COVID-  19 pandemic is the first crisis to 
which the IMF has responded with a broad-  
based provision of emergency assistance. In 
total, 76 countries were supported by emer -
gency assistance between March 2020 and the 
end of 2021, in contrast to just 16 countries 
that had used such financial assistance in the … are key

13 Emergency assistance is envisaged in the event of acute 
balance of payments needs if an adjustment programme is 
either not necessary (balance of payments disruption is 
purely temporary and manageable without economic pol -
icy adjustment) or not possible (for example, in the event of 
insufficient administrative capacity or, as was the case with 
travel restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic, where 
programme negotiations are made difficult). Emergency as -
sistance may include preliminary measures, but does not 
impose any ex post conditionality on the recipient coun -
tries. The assistance can therefore be negotiated relatively 
quickly between the IMF and member countries and, after 
approval by the Executive Board, paid out in full over the 
short term. Emergency assistance comprises the Rapid 
Financing Instrument (RFI) and the Rapid Credit Facility 
(RCF).
14 The CCRT allows the IMF to provide debt service grants 
to the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the event 
of natural disasters or public health emergencies. CCRT 
grants were established in 2015 during the Ebola virus out -
break and modified in March 2020 in response to the 
coronavirus pandemic.

The Institutional View of the International Monetary Fund
International capital fl  ows have always 
played a prominent role in the context of 
the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) 
economic policy advisory activities. Although 
the Fund’s mandate includes the removal of 
restrictions on international payments for 
current account transactions, it does not 
cover rules for international capital fl  ows. 
However, the IMF is authorised to monitor 
capital fl  ows and provide countries with ad-
vice as part of its Article IV consultations. 
While the IMF had long advocated a pro-
gressive liberalisation of cross- border capital 
fl  ows, in part under the infl  uence of the 
Washington Consensus,1 a reassessment of 
the overall advantageousness of free capital 
movements began following the Asian crisis 
at the end of the 1990s and intensifi  ed in 
the wake of the global fi  nancial crisis of 
2008-09. This was due to considerable eco-
nomic problems arising in dealing with large 
and volatile capital fl  ows, particularly in 
emerging market economies.
The IMF subsequently adopted the Institu-
tional View on the Liberalization and Man-
agement of Capital Flows (Institutional 
View) to serve as a guideline for its recom-
mendations to its members on issues relat-
ing to capital fl  ows. The Institutional View 
attempts to strike a balance, against the 
backdrop of past experience and academic 
research, between preserving the benefi  ts 
of capital account liberalisation and em-
ploying capital fl  ow management measures 
(CFMs). The fundamental principles of the 
Institutional View state that free capital 
fl  ows are desirable as they can be advanta-
geous to a country, but that they may also 
lead to the emergence of risks to macro-
economic and fi  nancial stability, especially 
in the case of large and sudden capital out-
fl  ows. In order to counter such threats, member countries can adopt temporary 
and targeted CFMs, which should comple-
ment but not act as a substitute for neces-
sary macroeconomic adjustments.
In the spring of 2022, the fi  rst systematic 
review of the Institutional View was con-
cluded by the IMF’s Executive Board. The 
review was also used to integrate the IMF’s 
work on the Integrated Policy Framework 
(IPF) into the Institutional View. The IPF is a 
coherent analytical framework for analysing 
and assessing the interactions between 
monetary policy, exchange rate policy, for-
eign exchange market interventions, macro-
prudential measures and CFMs. It is de-
signed to enable model- based country- 
specifi  c recommendations to be made on 
how a country can respond to volatile inter-
national capital fl  ows. The aim of this is to 
support developing and emerging market 
economies, in particular, in designing an 
appropriate policy mix.
The review of the Institutional View con-
fi  rmed its core principles, but also clarifi  ed 
or expanded some of its statements. Gener-
ally, it was stressed that each country’s 
starting conditions, the nature of economic 
shocks and existing frictions play a major 
role in determining its optimal policy mix for 
1 The Washington Consensus describes a package of 
measures that was presented by John Williamson in 
Washington D. C. in 1989 and was promoted as a 
model for the reform efforts of developing and emer-
ging market economies. Its main features were the im-
plementation of reforms designed to open up and lib-
eralise the domestic economy and to make fi  scal ex-
penditure policy stability- oriented. The mixed success 
of the recommended reforms, policy recommenda-
tions that were perceived as simplistic and the associ-
ated neglect of social issues gave rise to substantial 
criticism over time. The IMF has since expanded and 
improved its analytical approach and strategy for eco-
nomic policy measures in the fi  elds of surveillance and 
lending. See Irving and Ward (2021).Deutsche Bundesbank

eleven years prior – that is, since the introduc -
tion of the emergency instruments in their cur -
rent form.16 Economic policy conditionality, 
which can be imposed in the form of prior ac -
tions, played a minor role in emergency assis -
tance during the pandemic.
The normally low use of emergency finance in -
struments and their relatively low access limits 
reflect fundamental thinking behind IMF finan -
cial assistance. For example, a key risk of emer -
gency assistance is that the necessary eco -
nomic policy adjustments and corrections of 
balance of payments imbalances are delayed. 
In the event of a loss of market access and un -
certainty about debt sustainability, excessive re -
course to emergency finance assistance by 
countries with impending debt problems can 
also lead to a delay in debt restructuring, which 
experience has shown ultimately goes hand in 
hand with higher costs for the countries con -
cerned.17IMF emergency assistance has enabled priority 
expenditure to combat the pandemic that 
would otherwise have been impossible or 
limited. In this way, it has also helped stabilise 
the balance of payments. Various countries re -
ceiving emergency assistance make commit -
ments to achieving transparency concerning 
specific forms of expenditure and certain ten -
ders. This has a positive impact. The implemen -
tation of such commitments can help to ensure 
sound budgetary management and contain 
corruption risks associated with short- term in -
creases in spending during the COVID-19 pan -
demic, thus helping demonstrate that emer -
gency assistance is being put to appropriate 
use.… may delay 
economic 
adjustments, …… while never -
theless enabling 
priority expend -
iture to combat 
pandemicmanaging risks from capital fl  ows. The main 
area in which the Institutional View was ex-
panded is based on a fi  nding from the IPF 
that the use of pre- emptive measures in the 
case of stability- jeopardising capital infl  ows 
can help reduce fi  nancial stability risks. By 
contrast, pre- emptive measures are still not 
considered to be effective in addressing 
capital outfl  ows.2 By reviewing and expand-
ing the basis for its economic policy recom-
mendations, the IMF is responding to new 
developments in the area of capital fl  ows as 
well as to criticism and suggestions from 
the world of research and the public.
The IMF will continue to refi  ne the Institu-
tional View in line with new challenges and 
insights from academic research. Some sig-
nifi  cant areas have not yet been covered by 
the analysis, but are set to be incorporated 
in future revisions. These include advancing 
digitalisation and the potential impact of private or public digital currencies on the 
volume and structure of capital fl  ows. 
Changes in cross- border investment that 
occur, for example, as a result of climate 
change and the policy measures taken in re-
sponse will also be paid greater attention. 
Finally, there are plans to examine the distri-
bution effects of CFMs with a social policy 
objective, which have been analysed very 
little to date. One example of these are the 
capital fl  ows for the acquisition of real 
estate  by non- residents and the potential 
undesirable effects on housing prices.
2 Furthermore, the Institutional View was, amongst 
other things, worded more precisely to clarify the 
measures it does not cover. These are CFMs that coun-
tries introduce for security reasons, to tackle money 
laundering and terrorist fi  nancing, in compliance with 
Basel standards for the fi  nancial sector or in response 
to international tax agreements to combat tax evasion. 
The IMF does not consider the appropriateness of or 
advise on these measures.
16 The previous corresponding instruments (Emergency 
Natural Disaster Assistance, ENDA, and Emergency 
Post-Conflict Assistance, EPCA) were also used only in isol -
ated cases and to a comparatively small extent.

emergency financial assistance to a broad 
group of countries led to an increase in IMF 
claims of almost 50% and to a doubling of the 
outstanding amounts of the Poverty Reduction 
and Growth Trust (PRGT), one of the trust funds 
managed by the IMF for the purposes of grant -
ing concessional financing loans to low- income 
countries (see the box on pp. 126 ff.). The pre -
vious record high of 2004 was clearly exceeded 
at the end of 2020. This sharp increase is par -
ticularly true for countries with high risks to the 
sustainability of their (external) public debt. 
With regard to the IMF’s own resources, the 
volume of outstanding IMF credit amounted to 
around SDR 93 billion at the end of 2020, close 
to the level of the previous historical peak in 
2012.18
During the COVID-  19 pandemic, the IMF con -
cluded precautionary arrangements with five 
member countries on access to non-concessional 
financial assistance, which can be drawn down 
if necessary. At the beginning of the pandemic, 
the IMF had two such precautionary financing 
facilities: the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) for coun -
tries with sound policies and the Precautionary 
and Liquidity Line (PLL) in the case of acute or 
potential balance of payments needs of coun -
tries with largely sound economic policies.19 As 
such arrangements can also be applied for by 
larger emerging market economies and allow 
access to substantial financial resources, these 
precautionary facilities account for more than 
half of the amount of financial assistance granted 
between March 2020 and the end of 2021. In 
addition, the IMF created another precaution -
ary instrument in the second quarter of 2020, 
the Short-term Liquidity Line (SLL). There has 
been little use of SLL in practice; it was used for 
the first and only time in May 2022 by only one 
country and for only a few months.
One hope relating to precautionary arrange -
ments is that they will counteract contagion ef -
fects. However, large- scale precautionary ar -
rangements may harbour unique financial risks 
for the IMF if the funds are actually drawn upon. After the funds have been drawn upon, 
the usual IMF safeguard in the form of eco -
nomic policy conditionality is largely elimin -
ated.20 Moreover, market participants can in -
terpret the drawdown of funds as a negative 
signal regarding the country’s economic sound -
ness. Consequently, there are important condi -
tions for protecting the benefits of precaution -
ary arrangements, on the one hand, and for 
mitigating risk for the IMF, on the other: the 
imposition of conditionality for exceptional ac -
cess and the avoidance of long- term use in the 
event of deteriorating fundamentals. Accord -
ingly, purely temporary use or a gradual reduc -
tion in the size of a country’s precautionary ar -
rangement until it expires can be seen as a sign 
of economic strength and would be consistent 
with the temporary nature of IMF financial as -
sistance.
Demand for adjustment 
programmes  declining
When looking only at traditional IMF financial 
assistance for the support of an adjustment 
programme (i.e. not the emergency and pre -
cautionary facilities described above), conspicu -
ous developments become visible. In general, 
over the past 40 years, it has usually been the 
case that programme requests have been sub -
mitted by countries that have already used IMF 
financial assistance in the recent past and then 
faced renewed balance of payments problems 
(see the chart on p. 122). This was particularly 
true for low- income countries which experi -
enced persistent balance of payments difficul -
ties. In the case of programme arrangements 
with emerging market economies, it can also 
be observed that some countries made use of 
IMF financing regularly and at comparatively Considerable

18 This could be traced back to the effects of the global 
financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in the euro 
area. Thanks to early repayments, the IMF’s exposure to 
euro area countries, which had been extremely high, 
quickly declined before coming to an end in the second 
quarter of 2022.

tight intervals. In general, the IMF sees this as a 
clear indication of the insufficient success of 
the previous IMF programmes. An incomplete 
implementation of programme conditionality 
or a departure from stability- oriented economic 
policies before or relatively shortly after the end 
of the programme often play a role in this.21 
This is problematic for the IMF in a number of 
ways. On the one hand, confidence in the eco -
nomic policy seal of approval of IMF pro -
grammes can suffer if programmes fail to 
achieve their objectives in a sustainable man -
ner. This also reduces the likelihood of pro -
grammes having a catalytic effect. On the other 
hand, the IMF may, as a result, be required to 
make available new financial resources in order 
to avoid jeopardising the repayments to the 
IMF from the failed programme. It is therefore 
important to implement sufficiently ambitious 
adjustment measures under the programme to 
overcome the country’s balance of payments 
problems and to enable the programme to suc -
ceed. The higher the level of IMF financial assis -
tance for a country, the more extensive the ad -
justment under the programme will have to be 
in order to sufficiently improve the balance of 
payments situation and thus ensure the cap -
acity to repay.
Although the IMF’s response to the COVID-  19 
pandemic was novel, the focus on financial as -
sistance not tied to IMF programme condition -
ality observed in 2020 and the increase in ex -
posure to low- income countries continued to 
follow trends that had been observed for some 
time. The relative importance of traditional in -
struments with comprehensive adjustment pro -
grammes has declined over time (see the chart 
on p. 123).
At the beginning of the 1980s, IMF- supported 
adjustment programmes were the IMF’s most 
widely used instrument for providing balance 
of payments assistance to member countries.22 
In the mid-  1980s, the toolkit was expanded es -
pecially for low- income countries in order to in -
clude concessional instruments, which are cur -
rently financed out of the PRGT.23 Following the global financial and economic crisis, since 
2009 the IMF has expanded its toolkit to in -
clude new precautionary financing facilities24 
and newly designed, more flexible emergency 
assistance.25 The proportions of the various in -
struments through which the IMF provides bal -
ance of payments assistance have shifted over 
the past four decades. Since the mid-  1980s, 
IMF concessional programmes have become 
increasingly important. This is likely to be due 
to the increasing share of low- income coun -
tries in its membership. Accordingly, the share 
of traditional, non- concessional adjustment 
programmes has declined. Since the introduc -
tion of new precautionary financing facilities 
and flexible emergency assistance from 2009 
onwards, this development has continued, 
reaching a preliminary peak in response to the 
COVID-  19 pandemic.
Demand for the IMF’s traditional adjustment 
programmes has declined in parts of its mem -
bership, probably because countries have be -
come more resilient or other sources of fund -
ing have made the IMF less attractive. Some 
members have stepped up their crisis prepared -
ness, and countries in South- East Asia, in par -
ticular, have applied for virtually no financial as -
sistance from the IMF for many years. In the 
past decade, global financing conditions for 
many emerging market economies have also 
been rather favourable by historical standards. 
By contrast, the use of Regional Financing Ar -
rangements (RFAs), which were created or ex -
panded in part after regional crises, remains Shift to instru -

observable for

22 There have been a number of past IMF financing facil -
ities with special purposes and designs. These are described 
in more detail in Deutsche Bundesbank (2013), but will not 
be expanded on any further.
23 The practice of concessional lending to low-  income 
countries had already begun in 1976 and has been stepped 
up from 1986 using stand- alone facilities. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013).
24 While precautionary lending facilities existed before 
2009, such as the Contingent Credit Line (CCL) or the 
Short-term Liquidity Facility (SLF), these were never used. 
See Deutsche Bundesbank (2013).
25 Prior to 2009, there were IMF instruments that were 
somewhat similar to the current emergency instruments, 
such as the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) or the 
ENDA and EPCA.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

very limited. For low- income countries, a larger 
supply of loans from bilateral creditors outside 
the Paris Club26 is also likely to be a relevant 
factor, with China’s claims on low and medium- 
income countries reported to the World Bank 
rising by around 100% – or US$80 billion – be -
tween 2013 and 2018.27 Together with lower 
debt service to traditional creditors following 
previous debt restructuring initiatives, this 
could have led to the somewhat lower number 
of programme requests to the IMF in the 2010s, 
despite a continuous increase in debt risk over 
this period. At the same time, one other ex -
planation of the decline in the share of IMF-  
supported adjustment programmes may be 
that the IMF’s expanded range of new precau -
tionary financing facilities and more flexible 
emergency assistance on offer since 2009 has 
led to some crowding- out. An applicant coun -
try with balance of payments problems might 
regard emergency assistance without being 
tied to a macroeconomic adjustment programme 
as an attractive option. Precautionary financing 
facilities with particularly strict conditionality 
should, if they are consistently observed, hardly 
be able to compete with the regular adjust -
ment programmes.28 By contrast, precaution -
ary facilities with a limited conditionality are 
likely to provide some competition if countries 
wish to avoid a comprehensive adjustment pro -
gramme.29Risks associated with lending 
on the rise
Another issue relevant when assessing IMF 
financial assistance is risk in cases where the 
IMF has pledged particularly high commitments 
to individual member countries. Finding an ap -
propriate response to balance of payments cri -
ses that arise as a result of large capital out -
flows combined with uncertainty about the 
sustainability of public debt poses a major chal -
lenge for the IMF. Even short- term stabilisation 
to ward off defaults regularly requires the de -
ployment of significant funds. Yet, at the same 
time, the potential for economic policy adjust -
ment is often severely restricted (by time, social 
and political constraints). If, in these cases, an 
IMF commitment fails to produce a catalytic ef -Particularly high

26 The Paris Club is an informal body of creditor countries 
that becomes involved in coordinated debt restructuring 
negotiations when countries that are indebted to foreign 
governments face payment difficulties and ask for their 
debt service to be adjusted.
27 These figures are likely to significantly understate Chi -
na’s actual lending to emerging market economies. In a de -
tailed study, researchers from the Kiel Institute for the 
World Economy concluded that around half of China’s 
international lending to developing and emerging market 
economies does not appear in official statistics. See Horn et 
al. (2019).
28 So far, arrangements have been concluded with five 
countries, of which only one country has actually drawn on 
funds.

fect (for example, a rapid restoration of market 
confidence or the use of extensive support 
from partner countries), the IMF is likely to face 
considerable risks. In recognition of this, the 
IMF has established tailored conditionality for 
financial assistance in excess of certain thresh -
olds.30 These criteria are designed to help en -
sure that deep-  seated solvency problems are 
not treated as pure liquidity crises and that the 
ability to make repayments to the IMF is main -
tained. Moreover, a credible commitment by 
the IMF can reduce the threat of moral hazard 
on the part of those members anticipating IMF 
financial assistance.31
High individual commitments entail consider -
able financial risks for the IMF. In mid- 2022, for 
example, only three countries had liabilities to 
the IMF in excess of the threshold for excep -
tional access. Yet, with a total of more than 
SDR 50 billion, these three countries’ liabilities 
accounted for over half of outstanding IMF 
credit.
High levels of outstanding IMF credit can also 
weaken the catalytic effect of an assistance 
programme. Having an elevated level of liabil -
ities to a preferred creditor, such as the IMF, 
may make it more difficult for a country to re -
gain market access and thus diminish the pro -
spects for success of an IMF- supported adjust -ment programme. Empirical evidence indeed 
suggests that this holds true.32 In the case of 
conventional IMF lending programmes over the 
period from 1990 to 2018, for instance, it was 
virtually impossible to demonstrate a positive 
catalytic effect of IMF financial assistance once 
the amount of financing exceeded 5% of the 
country’s gross domestic product. Unlike the 
average arrangements over this period, these 
programme arrangements show no positive 
impact on private capital flows, in particular. In -
stead, there is a danger that the IMF may have 
crowded out private capital, as its preferred 
creditor status means that private investors 
have to expect higher losses in the event of a 
default.
In practice, however, there are difficulties in 
consistently applying the criteria for excep -
tional access. For example, when requesting 
IMF financial assistance, solvency analyses are 
subject to considerable uncertainty, as is a 
country’s political willingness to make eco -
nomic policy adjustments. If the country in 
question rules out early debt restructuring or at Concentration

30 See International Monetary Fund (2015). In 2021, the 
access limits for low- income countries were abolished, thus 
also allowing exceptional access to the PRGT’s lower-  
interest funds. Under certain conditions, this enables the 
IMF to provide more funds to low- income countries.

least extending maturities, the IMF may come 
under pressure to apply its criteria with greater 
flexibility. Recently, it has been increasingly ar -
gued that exceptional access can also be justi -
fied in cases where sufficient capacity (usually 
private bondholders’ claims) remains after the 
programme has been concluded to enable 
debt sustainability to be established at a later 
point in time by means of debt restructuring. 
Such an argument, however, runs the risk of 
scaring off private creditors entirely and elimin -
ating the positive signalling effect of IMF finan -
cial assistance. This is likely to be the case in 
precisely those situations where it is uncertain 
whether the necessary reforms and adjustment 
measures will be implemented.
Overindebtedness risks, especially in low-  
income countries, have increased steeply in re -
cent years. From the beginning of the 2000s 
up to around early 2013, the IMF classed the 
debt sustainability of these countries as increas -
ingly robust, partly as a result of international 
debt relief initiatives. However, the picture has 
deteriorated sharply in recent years. Overall, 
the IMF currently regards just over 50 low-  
income countries as being at high risk of a debt 
crisis, which has already materialised in some 
cases.
If doubts about debt sustainability are espe -
cially high or where arrears have already oc -
curred in the past, before making a financial 
commitment the IMF has to ascertain whether 
creditors will agree to debt restructuring or 
whether the conditions for IMF financial assis -
tance will be met in the event of arrears to pri -
vate or public creditors.33 The desired catalytic 
effect of IMF financial assistance can only be 
achieved if the risks to sustainability can be 
lastingly reduced. By contrast, stalled negoti -
ations on debt relief for private or public cred -
itors, on the one hand, and an insufficiently 
ambitious economic policy adjustment, on the 
other, will hinder the arrangement of credible 
IMF programmes. Thus, in order to ensure the 
programmes are efficient, the IMF is dependent on well- functioning international cooperation 
on debt issues.
The creditor structure of highly indebted coun -
tries has become considerably more heteroge -
neous in recent years. Non- Paris Club countries 
have significantly expanded their bilateral lend -
ing to low to medium- income countries over 
the past decade. In response to these chal -
lenges, in 2020 the Group of Twenty (G20) cre -
ated an effective coordination framework for 
the participation of all bilateral public creditors. 
The temporary Debt Service Suspension Initia -
tive (DSSI)34 for the 77 poorest countries was 
then succeeded by the permanent Common 
Framework.35
Both the above- mentioned shift toward finan -
cial assistance not tied to the conditionality of 
an IMF programme and the emergence of 
cases involving exceptional access imply that 
the track record of IMF financial assistance has 
not always been successful in recent years. In 
view of the simultaneous rise in the number of 
overindebtedness crises in emerging and low-  
income countries, the arrangement of conven -
tional IMF programmes is currently a crucial 
challenge. Ultimately, the IMF can only provide 
its members with the best possible support 
through sufficiently ambitious adjustment pro -
grammes and ensuring debt sustainability, 
which, if necessary, must also involve debt re -
structuring. In order to safeguard its soundness 
even in the event of financial risk materialising, 
effective risk management at the IMF, including 
the formation of reserves, is key.Rising risk of

protection, for example. In total, the participating creditor 
countries deferred US$12.9 billion.
35 The Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond 
the DSSI, endorsed by the G20, provides a framework for 
coordinated debt restructuring. Restructuring is conditional 
on the country concerned being eligible under the DSSI 
and signing an IMF- supported adjustment programme. A 
further aim is to ensure the adequate participation of pri -
vate creditors in debt restructurings.Deutsche Bundesbank

The IMF’s financial resources 
and risk management
At regular intervals, usually every five years, the 
IMF conducts general quota reviews, which as -
sess the Fund’s own resources (quotas) and the 
quota structure, adjusting them if necessary. 
The last decision to increase IMF quotas was 
made under the 14th General Review of Quotas 
in 2010.36 The quotas were doubled to SDR 477 
billion. As a result of this quota increase, the 
quota shares of IMF members also changed. 
These are key in determining, amongst other 
things, the voting shares in the IMF. The share 
of developing and emerging market economies 
has risen relatively sharply. This shift in the 
quota structure takes account of the growing 
role of developing and emerging market econ -
omies in the global economy and has strength -
ened the representation of these countries in 
the IMF as a whole. The 15th General Review 
of Quotas was concluded in February 2020, 
after the finalisation date had been postponed 
several times in the absence of an agreement, 
without a quota increase. The 16th General 
Review  of Quotas is currently underway and 
scheduled for completion by 15  December 
2023.
The International Monetary and Financial Com -
mittee (IMFC)37 has repeatedly declared its 
commitment to a quota- based and adequately 
funded IMF. Notwithstanding the IMF’s com -
fortable resources, a moderate increase in 
quotas and a shift in the quota structure could 
be considered in order to strengthen the voting 
rights of those countries whose role in the 
global economy has grown since the last ad -
justment.
Credit lines from some member countries to 
the IMF are a safety mechanism in the event 
that quota resources prove insufficient in a cri -
sis situation. This option is specifically provided 
for in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and 
secures additional funds for loans to members. 
The current credit lines are divided into the per -
manent multilateral New Arrangements to Bor -row (NAB), and the temporary Bilateral Borrow -
ing Agreements (BBAs). The IMF’s additional 
resources  available from the NAB and BBAs 
amount to just under SDR 500 billion (see also 
the box on pp. 126 ff.). Irrespective of the source 
of funding (quota resources or borrowing), the 
IMF is jointly and severally liable in the event of 
possible defaults, which limits the risk for NAB 
and BBA lenders.
The NAB constitute the first possibility for ex -
panding IMF resources. Once it has become 
clear that the IMF will need to supplement its 
resources to address a threat to the inter -
national monetary system,38 lenders and the 
Executive Board may decide to activate the 
NAB in part or in full for a maximum of six 
months.39 When drawing on credit lines under 
the NAB, the IMF follows the principle of 
burden- sharing and uses the resources pro -
vided by different lenders as evenly as possible. 
38 member countries or their central banks, in -
cluding the Bundesbank for Germany, currently 
participate in the NAB. Two other members 
have announced their future participation. The 
total NAB amount to SDR  361 billion. They 
have been in place since 1998 and extended 
several times; the last extension took place in 
2021 for a further five years until December 
2025.The IMF’s finan -

37 The IMFC is the IMF’s policy advisory committee. At its 
biannual meetings, the 24 members from the ranks of 
finance ministers and central bank governors, representing 
all 190 member countries, discuss global economic devel -
opments and IMF policy issues, including the IMF manage -
ment’s Global Policy Agenda, and formulate a joint assess -
ment, which is usually published in a communiqué.
38 “As the Fund is a quota-based institution, the credit ar -
rangements provided for under the terms of this decision 
shall only be drawn upon when quota resources need to 
be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an im -
pairment of the international monetary system.” Executive 
Board decision on the NAB; see International Monetary 
Fund (2020b).
39 This requires a majority of (voting) NAB participants 
which together account for 85% of the total NAB as well 
as approval by the Executive Board. The activation process 
is initiated by a proposal to this effect from IMF manage -
ment. Once an activation period has expired, it is possible 
to agree further activation periods in the same way.Deutsche Bundesbank

The International Monetary Fund’s fi  nancial resources: 
size and distribution of contributions
Financial assistance provided by the Inter-
national Monetary Fund (IMF) is funded 
through contributions from its member 
countries. This means that it is not depend-
ent on funding from the fi  nancial markets. 
Financial assistance is paid out either in spe-
cial drawing rights (SDRs) or in one of the 
fi  ve currencies that also form the currency 
basket for the daily calculation of the SDR 
value: US dollar, euro, renminbi, yen and 
pound sterling.1
IMF fi  nancial assistance to member coun-
tries can be divided into two categories: 
non- concessional fi  nancing, which can be 
used by all members, and concessional 
fi  nancing, i.e. lending at lower interest 
rates. The latter is only available to low- 
income countries. Non- concessional fi  nan-
cing is funded primarily from the mandatory 
capital contributions of all IMF members, 
the quota subscriptions.2 25% of these cap-
ital contributions3 are paid in SDRs or one 
of the fi  ve aforementioned basket curren-
cies, which the IMF considers to be freely 
usable. The IMF can make direct use of this 
part of members’ quota subscriptions. In 
order to be able to mobilise the remainder 
of the subscriptions, which are paid in a 
member’s own currency, the IMF has a spe-
cial fi  nancing mechanism (Financial Transac-
tions Plan – FTP)4 that currently includes 
around 50 countries considered to have a 
strong reserve position. Issuers of one of 
the fi  ve SDR basket currencies can provide 
the necessary funds in their own currency – 
Germany, for example, in euro. Other coun-
tries have to make use of their reserve 
assets. In either case, the contributing 
countries receive a claim on the IMF in re-
turn, which they can record as a reserve 
asset.If, in a crisis situation, the quota resources, 
which amount to around SDR 477 billion, 
are insuffi   cient to provide fi  nancial assis-
tance, the IMF can borrow additional re-
sources from its members on the basis of 
the IMF Articles of Agreement. Numerous 
members or their central banks have con-
cluded borrowing arrangements with the 
IMF for this purpose. These borrowing ar-
rangements can take two forms: multilat-
eral New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), 
which were established in 1998 and have a 
volume of around SDR 361 billion, and tem-
porary Bilateral Borrowing Agreements 
(BBAs), which were agreed in 2020 and 
amount to around SDR  138 billion. At 
present, 38 and 42 countries provide the 
IMF with credit lines under the NAB and 
BBAs, respectively.
The following overview shows the contribu-
tions from the 20 largest IMF members to 
the funding of the IMF’s non- concessional 
lending.5 Germany’s contributions are made 
by the Bundesbank.
1 At present (as at 1 September 2022), the value of 
special drawing rights is SDR 1/ EUR 1.30139.
2 Each IMF member receives a quota, expressed in 
SDR, that refl  ects the country’s relative position in the 
world economy. This quota determines the country’s 
mandatory capital contribution to the IMF, the coun-
try’s share of SDR allocations and its voting power in 
the IMF.
3 Contributions are due, for example, when a country 
joins the IMF or following a decision to change the 
quota level or quota shares.
4 The FTP is adopted by the IMF Executive Board, usu-
ally every six months.
5 In addition to the countries listed in the table, 14 
other countries or their central banks participate in the 
NAB and have agreed a BBA with the IMF: Austria, 
Chile, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Malaysia, New 
Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, 
South Africa, Sweden and Thailand. Five other credit-
ors participate exclusively in the NAB: Cyprus, Hong 
Kong, Israel, Kuwait and Portugal. Nine other countries 
have signed a BBA only: Algeria, Brunei Darussalam, 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, Peru, Slo-
vakia and Slovenia.Deutsche Bundesbank

The funding of concessional lending is 
based on voluntary rather than mandatory 
fi  nancial contributions, with members pro-
viding loans or subsidies to trust funds ad-
ministered by the IMF. The largest IMF trust 
fund in terms of resources is the Poverty Re-
duction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The PRGT 
provides fi  nancial assistance to low- income 
IMF members to support economic policy 
adjustment programmes or help in emer-
gency situations. The Poverty Reduction 
and Growth – Heavily Indebted Poor Coun-
tries Trust (PRG- HIPC Trust) serves a similar 
purpose. It helps fi  nance the HIPC Initiative, 
which provides highly indebted, low- 
income countries with support for debt re-
structuring. In emergency situations, such 
as a pandemic or natural disaster, the Catas-trophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) 
can furnish the poorest IMF members with 
grants to service debt owed to the IMF and 
the PRGT.
In April 2022, the IMF decided to set up a 
further trust fund. The Resilience and Sus-
tainability Trust (RST) is scheduled to be-
come operational in autumn 2022. Finan-
cial assistance from the RST is designed to 
support countries implementing reforms to 
address long- term challenges, such as cli-
mate change (see the box on pp.  115f.). 
Funding requirements for the RST are ex-
pected to total SDR 33 billion.

As the second “emergency reserve” after quota 
resources and the NAB, temporary BBAs were 
concluded directly between member countries 
and the IMF. They are broadly standardised be -
tween lenders in terms of form and modalities. 
Lenders have a say in potential activation, simi -
lar to the NAB. In total, SDR 138 billion is avail -
able through BBAs. These credit lines can be 
used by the IMF if additional resources are 
needed beyond the NAB funds. If BBAs are 
used by the IMF, funds are drawn as evenly as 
possible from the respective member countries, 
as with the NAB. 42 members or their central 
banks have currently signed a BBA, including 
the Bundesbank. The current BBAs run until the 
end of 2023 and, after approval by the lenders, 
can be extended by a maximum of one year.
The IMF thus currently has a total of just under 
SDR 1 trillion at its disposal for non- concessional 
lending.40 Measured against historical highs, 
this is more than five times the amount of lend -
ing commitments and just over ten times the 
amount actually disbursed by the Fund. On an 
ongoing basis, the IMF calculates its one- year 
Forward Commitment Capacity (FCC), which 
indicates the amount of resources available for 
new lending over the next 12 months.41 If the 
FCC is deemed to have fallen too low, the Fund 
may partially or fully activate the multilateral 
credit lines and, if necessary, bilateral credit 
lines as well. The chart above illustrates that 
the IMF’s lending capacity has been sufficient 
at all times over the past decade, taking into 
account the credit lines which were only acti -
vated during a limited period. The multilateral 
credit lines were activated between April 2011 
and February 2016 in the wake of the global 
financial crisis and the ensuing financial assis -
tance. There was no need to activate the add -
itionally available bilateral credit lines. Since 
then, quota resources have always proved suf -
ficient, even during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The IMF has an FCC of around SDR 170 billion 
(as at the end of August 2022) and is thus com -
fortably equipped to fulfil new requests for 
financial assistance solely from quota subscrip -
tions.The IMF’s risk management
Given the heightened financial risks caused by 
the lending activity of recent years, effective 
risk management by the IMF has become all 
the more important. The Fund’s risk manage -
ment spans a variety of components. For ex -
ample, in response to requests for financial ar -
rangements, it scrutinises the sustainability of 
the relevant countries’ sovereign debt as well 
as the governance and control structures of 
their central banks (safeguard assessments). 
The aim of these assessments is to ensure that 
the borrower is able to properly manage Fund 
resources and repay them on schedule. More -
over, the IMF has a number of instruments at 
its disposal to limit risks even before an agreed 
programme is started. These span volume limits 
on financial assistance (access limits); disburse -
ment in tranches based on programme pro -… and only

gress; programme design, including condition -
ality on economic policies and reforms; and cri -
teria for exceptional access. The Fund’s de 
facto preferred creditor status helps to ensure 
that its loans will be repaid after programmes 
have come to an end. Post- programme moni -
toring also provides it with an instrument for 
monitoring the capacity to repay even after 
programmes have been completed.
Being in arrears to the IMF represents a serious 
breach of membership obligations and poses a 
particular challenge for the IMF’s financing 
mechanism, which is based on the reserve 
assets characteristics of financial contributions 
by members. In the past, this has only occurred 
in isolated, albeit sometimes very drawn- out, 
cases. Arrears can lead to escalating sanctions, 
including a withdrawal of membership rights. 
The IMF has the option of employing what is 
known as the cooperative arrears strategy to 
resolve such cases, which enables the members 
concerned, in consultation with the Fund, to 
provide evidence of their cooperation with the 
IMF through implementing reforms and re -
maining current with the IMF on new payment 
obligations falling due. This is intended to help 
mobilise external assistance and ultimately 
clear the arrears. Improved cooperation with 
the Fund makes it possible to gradually lift any 
restrictions on membership rights.
Financially, the Fund buffers against credit risk 
by forming reserves, the size of which is based 
on existing and expected repayment claims 
(precautionary balances). These reserves are es -
sentially derived from IMF budget surpluses. In 
recent years, they were expanded significantly 
to SDR 21 billion as a result of income from 
more sizeable loans. However, they are still 
below the target level. If a member is at immi -
nent risk of falling into arrears, the Fund can 
form additional reserves. However, an ultimate 
loss of IMF credit can only occur if a defaulting 
member withdraws from the Fund and fails to 
pay its liabilities. The Fund’s gold holdings pro -
vide an important additional buffer in the IMF’s 
balance sheet, especially in times of height -ened financial risk and limited risk reserves. 
With their high hidden valuation reserves, they 
play a key part in maintaining confidence in the 
financial integrity of the IMF. This is important 
in order to protect the Fund’s special financing 
mechanism and for IMF members to be able to 
book their financial contributions to the IMF as 
reserve assets on their balance sheets.
Germany and the IMF
The large expansion of IMF membership and 
the growth in the global economy have been 
accompanied by a significant rise in the IMF’s 
financial strength. While the quota total based 
on the mandatory capital subscriptions of 
members has grown by around a factor of 55 
from 1952 to the present day, Germany’s sub -
scription as measured by quota resources has 
risen by a factor of 81. This reflects periods of 
comparatively strong growth in the German 
economy and the country’s global economic 
integration. Germany’s quota thus stands at 
5.6% at present, compared with 3.8% when it 
joined the Fund. This also forms the basis for 
the country’s voting power in the IMF, which is 
currently 5.3%.
Germany’s financial contributions to the Fund 
already go well beyond the size of its quota 
owing to commitments made under the NAB 
and through bilateral credit lines. For example, 
the financing share made up by the Bundes -
bank’s commitments to the IMF alone stands 
at just under 6.8%. When the voluntary funds 
transferred from Germany’s Federal budget to 
trusts administered by the IMF are factored in, 
the divergence between financial contributions 
and voting power is even wider. However, the 
same is true of some other European countries, 
along with Japan and China.… includes a

The Bundesbank has a legal mandate42 to exer -
cise the financial rights and obligations arising 
from Germany’s membership of the IMF and is 
involved in representing the country within the 
IMF. Accordingly, it makes the financial contri -
butions to the Fund set out in the IMF’s Articles 
of Agreement. Germany’s voluntary financial 
contributions to IMF-  administered trust funds 
for providing financial assistance to specific 
groups of countries, often motivated partly by 
development policy considerations, are made 
by the Federal Government and approved via 
the Federal budget.
Germany participates in the IMF’s SDR system 
and in SDR allocations and exchange transac -
tions in accordance with the procedures estab -
lished by the Fund; these are executed by the 
Bundesbank (for more on the SDR system, see 
pp. 109 ff.). In agreements with the IMF, the 
Bundesbank  and a number of other govern -
ments and central banks have agreed to volun -
tarily execute SDR exchanges requested by 
other members against their own currency or 
another freely usable currency. As such exchanges 
via balance sheets may also have monetary pol -
icy implications, the Eurosystem has agreed 
limits for SDR holdings resulting from voluntary 
purchases and sales of SDRs. Over the past few 
years, however, in practice the Bundesbank has 
actually received only a relatively small number 
of requests from other members for SDR ex -
changes via the IMF. Even the very large SDR al -
location in 2021 has not changed this so far. 
The Bundesbank aims to keep its own SDR 
holdings close to the size of the SDR allocation. 
This minimises exchange rate and interest rate 
risk to the Bundesbank’s balance sheet.43
Throughout its 70- year membership, Germany 
has never needed to request financial assistance 
from the IMF, but has nonetheless benefited in 
other ways from its membership. Notable ex -
amples include Germany’s involvement in inter -
national monetary cooperation within the frame -
work of the IMF, the benefits of the Fund’s key 
contribution to the functioning of the inter -
national monetary system and its stability, and the Fund’s advisory activities regarding eco -
nomic policy and the financial sector. Like all 
members, Germany is subject to bilateral sur -
veillance by the IMF. Most recently, the Fund 
provided advisory services to Germany in the 
form of an Article IV consultation and an FSAP , 
which concluded in July 2022; the results were 
published by the Fund (see p. 132 for details).
The Bundesbank’s tasks in the context of Ger -
many’s membership of the IMF are not limited 
to the exercise of financial rights and obliga -
tions, which are also reflected in the Bundes -
bank’s balance sheet and explained in its An -
nual Report. In accordance with the IMF Act, 
the Bundesbank also has to be involved in Ger -
many’s political positioning when decisions are 
taken in IMF bodies, working in close cooper -
ation with the Federal Ministry of Finance. This 
is also reflected in the country’s representation 
at the IMF. The President of the Bundesbank is 
traditionally the deputy to the Federal Minister 
of Finance as a member of the IMFC and is 
Germany’s member of the Board of Governors, 
the highest decision- making body of the IMF. 
In addition, the Bundesbank, like the Federal 
Ministry of Finance, seconds its own staff to 
the German Executive Director’s Office at the 
IMF as temporary advisers and, in alternation 
with the Federal Ministry of Finance, staffs the 
positions of the Executive Director and his or 
her deputy. Under the IMF Act, Germany’s rep -
resentatives in the IMF are to act on the in -
structions of the Federal Ministry of Finance, 
which are devised in close cooperation with 
the Bundesbank. From the Bundesbank’s point 
of view, its close and trusting cooperation with 
the Federal Ministry of Finance based on the 
provisions set out in the IMF Act of 1978 has 
proven its worth over a great many years and 
has supported Germany’s successful participa -
tion in international monetary cooperation

Article IV consultation and Financial Sector Assessment 
Program  with Germany in 2022
In accordance with Article IV of the IMF’s 
Articles of Agreement, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) regularly examines its 
member countries’ economic developments 
and economic policies. This forms part of 
the IMF’s economic and fi  nancial policy sur-
veillance and is intended to help prevent 
crises (for a description of the IMF’s surveil-
lance, see the section entitled “The IMF’s 
economic policy advice”, starting on p. 111). 
Article IV consultations with Germany take 
place on an annual basis, with this year’s 
occurring in the fi  rst half of 2022. IMF rep-
resentatives held numerous discussions 
with Federal ministries, the Bundesbank 
and other public authorities, trade unions, 
economic research institutions, associ-
ations, and fi  nancial and non- fi  nancial en-
terprises. In its concluding statement and 
detailed consultation report, the IMF com-
mended the authorities for their timely and 
overall well- designed policy response to the 
pandemic and the spillovers from Russia’s 
war of aggression against Ukraine. It ex-
pects Germany’s economic recovery to be 
slower than anticipated at the beginning of 
the year, noting that the greatest downside 
risk to growth is a shut- off of Russian gas 
supplies. It therefore recommends topping 
up energy reserves, transitioning to renew-
able energy and setting incentives to reduce 
energy consumption. The IMF considers 
additional supply bottlenecks and the im-
pact of the sanctions imposed in response 
to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to be further 
risks to the German economy. Any fi  scal 
support measures that are required should 
be temporary and targeted in order to avoid 
additional infl  ationary pressures. Moreover, 
the IMF notes that there is fi  scal space and 
suggests that it be used to enhance growth 
potential and resilience to risks to growth in the medium term. The consultation report 
was discussed at a meeting of the IMF’s Ex-
ecutive Board on 18 July 2022, then pub-
lished together with the report prepared 
under the Financial Sector Assessment Pro-
gram (FSAP).1
The FSAP assesses national fi  nancial sectors 
and examines fi  nancial stability and the 
quality of the regulatory framework. For 
Germany, which is deemed to have a sys-
temically important fi  nancial sector, the 
FSAP is carried out every fi  ve years. The as-
sessments began last year and consisted of 
numerous discussions with representatives 
from the German supervisory authorities 
and the fi  nancial sector as well as compre-
hensive analyses. The current FSAP indi-
cates a resilient fi  nancial system with high 
capital and liquidity buffers in the banking 
system and robust public and private sector 
balance sheets. The IMF also commends 
the decisive use of macroprudential instru-
ments and the enhancement of micropru-
dential frameworks since the last FSAP re-
view in 2016. According to the IMF, low 
bank profi  tability and a potential price cor-
rection in residential real estate could be 
sources of vulnerability. In this context, the 
IMF underlines the urgency of activating 
borrower- based measures. Given the down-
side risks to the real economy, the IMF rec-
ommends monitoring the fulfi  lment of cap-
ital and liquidity requirements closely so as 
to be able to respond quickly to changes in 
the stability situation.

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the

accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections as of 2020 Q1. Until 2019 Q4 these are compiled using Solvency I
supervisory data, supplemented by voluntary reports and own calculations.  1 Including
deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans
and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension funds on pension managers
and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical reserves "life" taking account oftransitional measures. Health insurance is also included in the "non-life insurance"
sector.  4 Own funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other
equity".  5 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by primary insurers, which
is included there.  6 Valuation at book values. The term "pension funds" refers to the
institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of Accounts. Pension funds
thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational pension schemes for the
self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  7 Change in data sources.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland,
Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were
used.  2 Includes countries belonging to the group EER-19 and additionally Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico,Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB suspends
the publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against
Russian rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation
of effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from
that date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of
Russia in conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to
the US dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 in-
cluding Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta,
from 2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia,
from 2015 including Lithuania) as well as Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  5 Euro area countries (current
composition) and countries belonging to the group EER-19.  6 Euro area countries (cur-
rent composition) and countries belonging to the group EER-42.
