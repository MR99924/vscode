Economic conditions
Underlying trends
In terms of its underlying trend, the German 
economy is continuing its upward trajectory. 
This is suggested by the results of the economic 
survey conducted by the German Chamber of 
Industry and Commerce (DIHK) in the early 
summer of 2014, as well as by the renewed 
pick- up in or ders received by industry. Never -
theless, following a very positive start to the 
year, real gross domestic product increased 
only slightly in the second quarter of 2014 after 
adjustment for seasonal and calendar vari -
ations. As was to be expected, construction 
output in April fell discernibly short of its high 
level in the first quarter, when the construction 
industry was benefiting from the mild winter 
weather. In addition to this, industry has not 
further increased its output following a side -
ways movement in incoming orders in the first 
quarter.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in April 
matched its level in the previous month, which 
was also in line with the first-  qu arter average. 
Output of intermediate goods likewise re -
mained virtually unchanged on the quarter. By 
contrast, production of capital goods fell 
slightly by ½%, while output of consumer 
goods rose by 1½%.
In April, German industry saw a considerable 
seasonally adjusted 3% rise in incoming orders compared to March, which had shown a sharp drop. This was up 1½% on the average of the 
previous quarter. The  demand stimulus came  
from foreign demand (+2½%), while there was 
no increased demand in Germany. The inflow 
of orders from the euro area grew at a faster 
rate (+4½%) than the order intake from non-  euro-  ar ea countries (+1½%). The increased vol -
ume of orders for the aircraft and aerospace 
industry played the key part in this. Orders of 
capital goods went up by a total of 2¼%. Ex -
cluding other transport equipment, where the 
intake of orders generally fluctuates strongly, a 
decline of 1% was recorded. Orders of inter -
mediate goods were slightly down on the quarter (-¼%). Consumer goods orders in -
creased by 3%.
After seasonal adjustment, industrial sales in 
April increased by ½% on the month. However, 
the second-  quarter aver age was just shy of the 
prior-  q uarter figure (-¼%). This was largely 
 attributable to lower export sales (-½%), while 
domestic sales remained in line with the aver -
age of the winter months. The decline in ex -
port business can be traced back to falling sales 
in non-  eur o-  ar ea countries (-2¾%), while 
growth by the same percentage amount was 
recorded in euro-  ar ea countries. Unlike export 
sales, the value of seasonally adjusted exports 
rose sharply by 3% in April compared to March. 
There was a quarter-  on-  quarter incr ease of 
1¼%. The value of imports in April remained 
unchanged at the previous month’s level. Im -
ports were down slightly on the first quarter 
(-½%), which was a result of falling import 
prices.
Construction
In April, construction output fell by 1¼% on 
the month in seasonally adjusted terms, thus returning to the high level that had been 
 attained prior to the sharp weather-  r elated rise 
at the start of the year. Compared to the first 
quarter, there was a decline of 2½%. The pri -
mary reason for this was the reduced output of 
the main construction sector (-4½%), which is, 
generally speaking, heavily affected by prevail-
ing weather conditions. By contrast, output in 
the finishing trades decreased only minimally Subdued

(-¼%) according to preliminary data. There was 
a seasonally adjusted 1¾% increase in orders 
received by the main construction sector in the 
first quarter of 2014 (the most recent figures 
available) compared to the final quarter of 
2013. Demand for housing grew very sharply. 
Additionally, there was perceptible growth in 
commercial construction projects, while public 
 sector construction is likely to have seen a 
 decline.
Labour market
Employment is continuing to rise. The number 
of persons in work in Germany in April rose 
perceptibly by a seasonally adjusted 32,000 on 
the month. As a result, the year-  on-  year r ate 
rose to 398,000 persons, or 1.0%. According 
to estimates from the Federal Employment 
Agency, the seasonally adjusted number of em-
ployees subject to social security contributions 
saw a very sharp month-  on-  month rise of  
62,000. The year-  on-  year incr ease amounted 
to 472,000 jobs, or 1.6%. While indicators continued to signal a positive outlook for the 
labour market in May, the Ifo employment bar -
ometer showed that enterprises’ willingness to 
recruit new staff was somewhat down on the 
month, albeit from an elevated level. The same 
applies to the Federal Employment Agency’s 
BA- X job index.
In seasonally adjusted terms, the number of persons officially registered as unemployed 
went up by 24,000. A part was also played in 
this by the fact that some of the seasonally 
 adjusted decline in unemployment in the first 
four months of the year (totalling 74,000 per -
sons) was due to the mild winter weather. The 
unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%. 
Unemployment was down by 55,000 persons 
compared with the previous year. Seasonally 
adjusted underemployment, which also in-
cludes persons taking part in labour market 
policy measures (excluding short-  time work),  
remained at virtually the same level as in the 
previous month, however. According to the Employment

 labour market barometer of the Institute for 
Employment Research, unemployment is ex -
pected to remain largely unchanged over the 
coming months.
Prices
In May, crude oil prices fell initially before accel -
erating again somewhat. The price of a barrel 
of Brent oil exceeded the previous month’s fig -
ure by an average of 1%. On average, crude oil 
prices in the first half of June were still just 
under the US$110 mark. As this report went to 
press, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil 
stood at US$111¾ against the backdrop of 
 escalating conflicts in the Middle East. The dis -
count on crude oil futures stood at US$3¼ for 
deliveries six months ahead and US$6½ for 
purchases 12 months ahead.
After seasonal adjustment, import prices in 
April showed a further month-  on-  month fal l. In 
addition, domestic industrial producer prices also went down again. This was primarily 
 attributable to the decline in energy prices and, 
to a much lesser extent, to lower prices for other goods. Annual inflation narrowed to 
2.4% for import prices and to 0.9% for produ -
cer prices.
Consumer prices in May dipped by a seasonally 
adjusted 0.2% compared with the previous 
month. While seasonally adjusted energy and 
food prices remained largely unchanged, prices 
of industrial goods fell somewhat more steeply 
than is normally the case in May. Prices of ser -
vices decreased solely due to package holidays. 
By contrast, housing rents continued their up -
ward trend. In May, the annual inflation rate 
dropped from 1.3% to 0.9% as measured by 
the national consumer price index (CPI), and 
from 1.1% to 0.6% according to the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The late 
date of Whitsuntide was also a factor in this, while the increases in lottery charges in May 
2013 dropped out of the annual CPI rate.Securities markets
Bond market
Gross issuance in the German bond market stood at €120.5 billion in April 2014, which 
was slightly up on the previous month’s €112.4 
billion. After deducting redemptions, which 
also increased, and taking account of changes 
in issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, domes -
tic debt securities totalling €23.6 billion net 
were redeemed. The outstanding volume of foreign debt securities in Germany rose by 
€16.8 billion during the reporting month, with 
the result that the overall volume of debt in -
struments in circulation in the German market 
fell by €6.8 billion.
In April, the public sector redeemed debt secur -
ities worth €12.1 billion net, of which €10.4 bil -
lion was redeemed by central government (in -
cluding the resolution agency which is classi -
fied as part of it). Predominantly five-  year F ed-
eral notes (Bobls), but also Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills), were redeemed in net terms (-€15.3 billion and -€1.8 billion respectively), 
while the outstanding volume of two-  year F ed-
eral Treasury notes (Schätze) and ten-  year F ed-
eral bonds (Bunds) increased to €4.3 billion and 
€1.9 billion respectively. The Federal states re -
deemed bonds amounting to €1.7 billion on 
balance.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt by €12.1 billion during the re -
porting month. In particular, debt securities is -
sued by specialised credit institutions (which 
also include public promotional banks, for ex -
ample) were redeemed (€11.1 billion). In add -
ition, the outstanding volume of public Pfand -
briefe also shrank (€2.0 billion). By contrast, 
other bank debt securities, which can be struc-tured flexibly, were issued for €0.9 billion net.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net value of €0.6 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with net redemptions in the amount 
of €1.9 billion one month earlier. On balance, Rise in inter-

these were solely bonds with maturities of 
more than one year. Non-  bank financial enter -
prises were issuers, while non-  financial corpor -
ations redeemed bonds in net terms.
Domestic non-  banks wer e the primary net pur -
chasers of bonds in April (€8.0 billion). This was 
exclusively foreign paper on balance. Resident 
credit institutions acquired debt securities for 
€1.7 billion net, with purchasing focused on 
domestic securities. By contrast, foreign invest -
ors sold interest-  bearing paper total ling €14.7 
billion. The Bundesbank’s holdings of debt 
 securities fell by €1.8 billion.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed scarcely any new shares in the German equity market (€0.1 billion). The volume of for -
eign equities in the German market increased 
by €2.1 billion over the same period. The sole purchasers were resident investors. Domestic 
credit institutions in particular added €9.9 bil -
lion worth of equities to their portfolios, all of 
which were German shares on balance. Non-  
banks acquired shares worth €2.1 billion net. 
However, non-  r esident investors sold domestic 
shares with a net value of €9.8 billion, as they 
have previously done ahead of dividend pay -
ment dates.
Mutual funds
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded weak 
net inflows of €2.8 billion. On balance, special -
ised funds reserved for institutional investors 
benefited from this in particular (€2.6 billion). 
Among the asset classes, share-  based funds  
were able to sell the highest volume of new 
shares (€4.4 billion). Mixed funds and mixed 
securities-  based funds also recorded inflows, 
however, to the tune of €1.0 billion and €0.8 
billion respectively. By contrast, bond-  based  
funds redeemed their own shares (€4.3 billion). 
The outstanding volume of foreign funds dis -
tributed in Germany increased by €2.5 billion 
during the reporting month. In April, mutual 
fund shares were purchased mainly by domes-
tic non-  banks (€6 .5 billion), as well as by resi -
dent credit institutions (€2.2 billion). By con -
trast, foreign investors sold German mutual 
fund shares worth €3.4 billion in net terms.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €18.4 billion in 
April 2014. The result was €1.3 billion down on 
the March level. This was attributable to the 
reduction of the surplus in invisible current 
transactions, which comprise services, income 
and current transfers. The trade surplus saw a 
more marginal improvement.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in April the foreign 
trade surplus went up by €0.7 billion on the Bulk of pur-

month to €17.4 billion. After adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar variations, the surplus 
increased by €2.7 billion, reaching €17.7 billion. Compared with the previous month, the value 
of exports grew (+3.0%) whilst imports re -
mained virtually unchanged (+0.1%).
In April, Germany recorded a total surplus of €3.3 billion in invisible trade, compared with 
€5.3 billion in March. The smaller surplus re -
flected the €3.2 billion decline in net cross-  
border factor income to €4.5 billion. This was 
primarily attributable to higher dividend pay -
ments to non-  r esidents. By contrast, the sur -
plus in the services sub-  account r ose by €1.1 
billion to €2.3 billion. The deficit in current 
transfers remained unchanged at €3.6 billion.
With confidence growing in the euro area, Ger -
man cross-  bor der portfolio investment resulted 
in net capital exports of €47.5 billion in April. 
The reasons for this development were both 
the sale of German securities by non-  r esident 
investors (€27.9 billion) and purchases of for -
eign securities by German market participants 
(€19.5 billion). Non-  r esident investors predom -
inantly sold German debt securities (€14.7 bil -
lion) and shares (€9.8 billion). On the other 
hand, German investors mainly stepped up 
their holdings of bonds from foreign issuers 
 denominated in euros (€14.3 billion). Domestic 
investors also built up their portfolios some -
what with foreign mutual fund shares (€2.5 bil -
lion).
Foreign investors mainly purchased German 
debt securities (€13.9 billion) and German 
shares (€5.9 billion). Resident market partici -
pants primarily acquired mutual fund shares 
(€4.3 billion) and debt securities (€3.4 billion) 
abroad. By contrast, they disposed of shares 
worth €3.7 billion.
In April, much like cross-  bor der portfolio invest -
ment, direct investment generated net capital 
exports, albeit to the tune of €13.7 billion. The 
€11.6 billion in funding which resident firms 
provided to their foreign affiliates played a key Lower surplus in

role. Short-  term intr a-  gr oup financial loans 
(€5.9 billion) and the reinvestment of earnings 
generated abroad (€3.8 billion) were driving 
factors. By contrast, the volume of foreign dir -
ect investment in Germany diminished by €2.2 
billion in April. Here, too, short-  term financial  
loans were a decisive factor.
Other statistically recorded investment – com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other assets – saw net capital in -
flows in April (€34.2 billion). Of this amount, 
€13.5 billion was attributable to enterprises’ and households’ transactions. General govern-ment also saw inflows of funds (€10.0 billion). 
Net external assets held by credit institutions remained virtually unchanged in April, while 
the Bundesbank’s external asset position shrank by €11.0 billion, chiefly on the back of increased 
deposits at the Bundesbank. In contrast to this, 
the TARGET2 balance, when viewed in isol -
ation, drove the Bundesbank’s asset position 
up to €7.6 billion.

Outlook for the German economy – 
macroeconomic projections for 2014 and 
2015 and an outlook for 2016
The German economy made a very buoyant start to 2014. Although it is unlikely to maintain the 
high rate of growth seen in the first quarter, there is a good prospect of fairly strong economic growth over the forecast horizon. This is predicated on Germany’s strengthened domestic econ -
omy as well as the ongoing improvement in the economic situation of the industrial countries 
and the gradual recovery of the euro area. Germany’s domestic economy is reaping the rewards of low unemployment, strong immigration, households’ and governments’ comparatively strong 
financial situation, elevated consumer sentiment, low corporate leverage and balanced price-  c ost 
ratios as well as very favourable funding conditions. By contrast, a tighter labour market going forward, which will be aggravated by measures such as the option of drawing a full pension at 63, will weigh on economic growth.
Under these conditions, the German economy is likely to expand by almost 2% this year in 
calendar-  adjusted terms, fol lowed by a gradually declining pace of growth over the next two 
years; in terms of unadjusted data, this would translate into growth rates for gross domestic 
product (GDP) of 1.9% in 2014, 2.0% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016, as calendar effects are fairly 
pronounced in some cases. As these rates of expansion significantly outstrip potential growth, 
aggregate capacity utilisation will rise noticeably. The increase in employment needed to lift eco -
nomic output this much would have to be fed primarily from immigration, given that unemploy -
ment has largely been reduced to a frictional and structural core and labour market participation is already fairly high. The anticipated tensions on the labour market are likely to be accompanied by an acceleration of wage growth, with the new general minimum wage another contributory factor.
The steeper wage growth will be reflected in higher rates of inflation. As measured by the Har-
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), inflation could rise from 1.1% this year to 1.5% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. This forecast assumes unchanged exchange rates and easing crude oil prices. Excluding energy, the rate of price increase could climb to more than 2% in 2016.
On the demand side, the main risks relate to the external environment. Heightened geopolitical 
tensions or a renewed flare-  up of the crises in the eur o area would dampen GDP growth not only 
through the external trade channel, but also by affecting confidence. On the supply side, there is 
considerable uncertainty as to the scale of future migration flows, the reserves that could still be 
mobilised on the domestic labour market as well as the effects of the minimum wage and the 
option of retiring on a full pension at 63. If supply-  side c onditions prove more favourable than 
assumed here, GDP growth is likely to be stronger and wage pressure weaker. In a scenario in 
which shortages increase more rapidly, wages and prices, at least, would rise more quickly and real economic growth could fall short of the path outlined here.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
The German economy was in remarkably good 
shape in the second quarter of 2014. Accord -
ing to surveys conducted by the Ifo Institute 
and the Association of German Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (DIHK), the vast major -
ity of enterprises view their economic situation as good or at least satisfactory, and consumers 
look to the future with a great deal of confi -
dence according to the consumer research in -
stitution, Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung  
(GfK). One factor is that aggregate capacity 
utilisation is good and employment is rising fur -
ther from an already high level, thanks in part 
to strong immigration.
The German economy grew strongly in the 
fourth quarter of 2013/first quarter of 2014. On 
top of the stronger economic momentum an -
ticipated in the December forecast, the winter 
was mild, which is likely to have contributed 
0.3 percentage point to economic growth in the first quarter.1 While GDP growth in the final 
quarter of 2013 was, on the supply side, almost 
entirely driven by the manufacturing sector, the construction and services industries took centre stage into 2014. On the demand side, exports were consequently predominant initially, before 
giving way to domestic demand in the first quarter, which was accompanied by percep -
tibly higher imports.
Exports had risen sharply in the last quarter of 
2013, attaining a much higher level than in the 
previous quarters; by and large, the heightened 
level was maintained at the beginning of 2014. 
The increase in exports anticipated in the senti -
ment indicators back in the third quarter of 
2013 is probably a key reason why business in-
vestment picked up in the final months of 2013 and first part of 2014 and now appears to have 
moved off the low that had been brought 
about in part by uncertainty.
Growth in private consumption moved largely 
in step with real disposable incomes over the 
winter months, but remained lacklustre, dash -
ing hopes raised by the extremely upbeat con -
sumer sentiment. Residential construction in -
vestment, by contrast, rose more sharply than 
expected. The exceptionally favourable wea -
ther conditions, particularly in the first two 
months of the year, allowed a slight reduction 
in the demand overhang for construction ser -
vices brought about by the high levels of cap -
acity utilisation.
On the labour market, the economic upswing 
made itself felt more rapidly and more compre-
hensively than anticipated in the December projection. The sharp growth in employment 
owed something to the continued large influx 
of workers from abroad. Net immigration con-
siderably exceeded previous projections again 
last year, at 437,000 persons.German econ-
omy remains in remarkably good shape

Growth in wage costs, as measured by com -
pensation of employees, was largely in line 
with expectations in the final quarter of 2013/
first quarter of 2014, although the scheduled 
reduction in the contribution rate to the statu -
tory pension insurance scheme was shelved to 
finance additional benefits. Growth in wage 
costs was dampened by a surprisingly pro -
nounced negative wage drift. In wholesale and 
retail trade, transport, and hotels and restaur -
ants especially, actual earnings fell well short of the increase in negotiated pay rates. One factor 
could have been that retail enterprises had, in 
part, anticipated the delayed pay settlement of 
December 2013 when setting remuneration, 
which meant that back payments at the begin -
ning of 2014 were lower than projected.
Consumer price inflation has flattened slightly 
more than forecast in the last projection. This 
was in very large part due to one-  off seasonal 
factors and an altered external environment. 
The mild winter weather dampened energy 
and food prices. Energy and industrial goods 
prices were also depressed by the appreciation 
of the euro. In addition, the levy to promote 
renewable energy drove up prices less than as -
sumed. Services prices, by contrast, rose in line 
with expectations.
Major assumptions
This projection is based on assumptions made 
by the Eurosystem’s experts concerning global 
trade, exchange rates, commodity prices and 
interest rates. The assumptions are based on in -
formation available as at 15 May 2014. The as -
sumptions regarding economic developments 
in the euro area are derived from projections by 
the national central banks of the euro-  ar ea 
countries.
Global economic growth, which had strength-
ened during 2013 on the back of improving in -
dustrial activity, lost some of its momentum 
going into 2014. Nonetheless, global economic 
growth is expected to pick up again in the course of the year. These hopes rest mainly on 
the industrial countries: as progress has been 
made in consolidating public finances and pri -
vate sector balance sheets and the general 
stance of monetary policy remains expansion -
ary, demand is likely to pick up perceptibly, 
which should, given spare capacity, translate into greater economic growth. In a host of emerging market economies, by contrast, 
structural bottlenecks are hampering economic 
growth. Moreover, financial and macroeco -
nomic imbalances are taking their toll, which 
means that emerging markets’ contribution to 
global growth will probably be distinctly lower 
than its average for the past decade. Overall, 
global growth in 2014 could be stronger than 
last year, at 3¼%, based on purchasing power 
parity, but the expectations awakened in the 
December projection would not quite be met – in part because the year got off to a weak start. A slight increase to 3¾% is expected for both 
2015 and 2016. The weak start to the year is 
also one of the reasons why growth in global 
trade, at +4% in 2014, is likely to be fairly muted and slower than predicted in the De -
cember projection. A significantly stronger ex -
pansion is not expected until the two subse -
quent years, when growth rates are projected 
to exceed 5%. The expansion in German enter -
prises’ sales markets is likely to fall slightly short Growth in wage 
costs in line with expectations

of the increase in global trade given the greater 
importance of the euro area.
The recovery process in the euro area that started in the second quarter of 2013 con -
tinued over the winter months, albeit still at a 
very subdued pace. Although the economic 
upturn is expected to accelerate over the fore-
cast horizon, aggregate capacity utilisation is 
still not likely to have returned to normal levels 
in 2016. The stronger global growth is ex -
pected to provide key catalysts for the euro 
area, with exports to non-  eur o-  ar ea countries 
likely to benefit from the ongoing adjustment 
of cost structures in some member states and 
the resulting improvement in competitiveness. 
In the current year, export growth will, how -
ever, still be dented by the lingering effects of 
the euro appreciation. The anticipated success 
in exports should also motivate increased fixed 
capital formation. Another factor that should 
be considered here is that the negative effects currently emanating from capacity underutilisa -
tion, the need to consolidate balance sheets 
and the restricted availability of bank loans in 
some countries are likely to fade only gradually. In addition, the labour market will only recover 
at a slow pace, meaning that high unemploy -
ment in a number of euro-  ar ea partner coun -
tries will continue to depress private consump -
tion. However, consumption will be boosted by the decline in energy prices assumed in the projection. Moreover, the fiscal consolidation pressure is unlikely to weigh on demand as much as in previous years. Overall, the euro area is expected to generate GDP growth of 1.0% in the current year. For 2015 and 2016, 
rates of 1.7% and 1.8% respectively are antici -
pated. Excluding Germany, this equates to growth of 0.7% this year, 1.6% in 2015 and 
1.8% in 2016.
The gradual recovery of the euro-  ar ea econ -
omy and the return of confidence have further lifted the euro. In the period that is relevant to 
the derivation of the exchange rate assump -
tions, the single currency traded at US$1.38, 3% higher than predicted in the December projection. The euro also firmed against the 
yen and the renminbi. In relation to the 20 cur -
rencies most important in terms of foreign 
trade, the euro appreciated 2%.
At the beginning of this year, crude oil prices 
initially declined substantially as oil production 
in Libya was expected to return to normal. 
With the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine 
and the concomitant supply-  side risks, prices  
spiked higher again temporarily. Later, political 
turmoil again curtailed the oil supply from 
Libya, even prompting the International Energy 
Agency to warn of supply shortages for the 
second half of 2014. Nonetheless, the forward 
prices from which the assumptions for crude oil 
prices are derived pointed downwards across 
all delivery periods at the time the projection 
assumptions were laid down. This projection 
therefore assumes a downward trajectory for 
crude oil prices. In US dollar terms, it is slightly 
higher than in the December projection, but 
the appreciation of the single currency means 
that in euro terms it is virtually unchanged. Given global economic growth, other com -
modity prices should pick up again perceptibly 
overall after moving sideways this year. Prices 
for food, beverages and tobacco moved sharply higher in the first months of the year, but might 
come back down some of the way going for -
ward.Recovery pro-

Continued low rates of consumer price infla -
tion and the announcement by the Governing 
Council of the ECB that it would maintain a 
high degree of monetary accommodation for 
an extended period and ease its monetary pol -
icy stance further, if need be, have further 
dampened expectations surrounding the out -
look for short-  te rm interest rates. Yields on 
nine to ten-  y ear government bonds also fell 
short of the assumptions made in the last pro -
jection. Consequently, only a very muted in -
crease in interest rates on bank loans in Ger -
many is assumed. The other financing condi -
tions, which are described as extremely favour -
able in Ifo and DIHK surveys, are also unlikely 
to deteriorate to any significant degree.2
The macroeconomic forecast only incorporates 
government measures that have either already 
been approved by parliament or have, at least, 
been defined in sufficient detail and are likely 
to be implemented. Looking at the labour mar -
ket, these include the general statutory min -
imum wage and the “pension at 63”: from July 
2014, those who have contributed to the pen-
sion system for 45 years will be able to draw a 
full state pension from the age of 63. This 
measure is expected to reduce the potential 
 labour force by around 165,000 persons, or 
0.4%, by 2016. The German government is fur -
ther planning to introduce a general minimum 
wage of €8.50 per hour from 1 January 2015. 
According to Bundesbank estimates based on 
the Socio-  Economic P anel (SOEP) and add -
itional information from other sources, the 
minimum wage could raise the aggregate 
wage bill by more than ½%, the majority in 
2015. Although the minimum wage will in -
crease wages mainly for what are referred to as 
“mini jobs”, low-  skil led jobs subject to social 
security contributions will also be affected. 
Given that wage costs in this area will rise fairly 
noticeably in some cases, the minimum wage is 
likely to  r educe employment prospects for the 
low- s killed and slightly raise the structural un -
employment rate in the medium term.Looked at in isolation, the fiscal policy meas -
ures included in the projection cause a signifi -
cant deterioration in the general government 
fiscal balance for 2014 and 2015 (by a total of 
¾% of GDP for 2015 as compared to 2013). 
On the revenue side, a reduction in the contri -
bution rate to the statutory pension insurance 
scheme is assumed for 2015, as the pension re -
serve ceiling would otherwise be exceeded. It is further assumed that the health insurance insti-
tutions will, on average, lower their contribu -
tion rates when their finances are reformed in 
2015 and raise them again from 2016 as re -
serves dwindle.3 In terms of income tax, the 
higher basic income tax allowance from 2014 
and the gradual transition to downstream tax -
ation of pensions throughout the forecast 
period especially will cause revenue shortfalls. 
Government spending will rise significantly from mid-2014 as benefits paid under the statutory pension insurance scheme
4 are ex -
panded. In healthcare and long-  term car e, the 
projection takes account of higher costs, in particular because discount agreements for Interest rates

pharmaceuticals will expire this year and reim-
bursement rates under the public long-  term  
care insurance scheme will be adjusted for in -
flation next year.5 The additional budget funds 
that the German Cabinet approved in March 
2014 –  mainly for transport infrastructure, 
childcare, education and research – will cause 
central government budget spending to rise 
year for year in the forecast period. As some of this additional spending is designed to ease the 
burden on state and local governments, it causes a smaller deterioration in the general 
government fiscal balance.
Economic outlook6
After recording sharp growth at the start of the 
year, the German economy is likely to initially 
expand at a distinctly slower pace. The excep -
tionally mild winter weather pushed activity 
levels, in the construction sector in particular, in 
the first quarter way over the seasonal norm. This thus results in a reverse rate effect in the 
second quarter in seasonally adjusted terms.7 
Furthermore, the manufacturing sector appears 
to have lost some momentum of late. This is suggested, inter alia,  by the fact that new 
orders received by the industrial sector in the 
first quarter stagnated at the Q4 level. How -
ever, industrial output in the second quarter 
may be better than indicated by the new order 
figures for the first quarter. Output has yet to 
feel the full impact of the accelerated volume 
of new orders over the course of 2013, prob -
ably due to the trend towards production 
smoothing. Furthermore, according to Ifo data, 
short-  term pr oduction expectations for the 
manufacturing industry are still expansionary 
and, according to Ifo and DIHK surveys, the 
medium-  term business expectations ar e pre -
dominantly positive, which suggests a rebound 
in new orders. Economic growth in Germany is 
thus expected to again be higher in the third 
quarter, especially seeing as demand for con -
struction work is still lively and consumers are 
optimistic. However, it is unlikely to quite match the average pace of expansion seen in the first 
half of the year.
In the medium term, too, there is a good pro -
spect of fairly strong economic growth. This is 
predicated on Germany’s strengthened domes -
tic economy as well as the anticipated improve-
ment in the economic situation of the industrial

5 The planned reform of long-  term car e – inasmuch as it 
goes beyond these adjustments – was not included, as no 
Cabinet decision had yet been made as this forecast was 
produced. Under the current draft legislation, contributions 
to long-  term care insurance would rise by 0.3 percentage 
point from 2015, and increased spending and transfers to 
special reserves are planned. The plans would slightly im -
prove the fiscal balance as compared to the present fore -
cast from 2015, as the additional revenue from contribu -
tions is, in part, to be used to create reserves and to cover 
the inflation-  r elated rise in reimbursement rates that are 
already included in the projection.6 This projection for Germany was completed on 22 May 2014. It was incorporated into the projection for the euro 
area published by the European Central Bank on 5 June 
2014. This is the last projection compiled on the basis of 
ESA 1995. On 1 September 2014, the Federal Statistical Office will publish the backcast national accounts figures 
based on the definitions contained in ESA 2010.7 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The impact of weather condi -

countries and the expected gradual recovery of 
the euro area. Germany’s domestic economy is 
reaping the benefits of low unemployment, strong immigration, households’ and govern -
ments’ comparatively strong financial position, 
low corporate leverage and balanced price-  cost 
ratios as well as very favourable funding condi-tions. Given this outlook, external demand, in-vestment and consumption should increase dis-
tinctly.
By contrast, a tighter labour market going for -
ward will weigh on economic growth. While 
the unfavourable demographic trend is cur -
rently being more than offset by increased im-
migration, measures such as the minimum 
wage and, above all, the option of long-  term  
contribution payers drawing a full pension at 63 are restricting the potential labour input 
and, in the medium term, fixed capital forma -
tion, too, because factors of production are complementary in the long term. This can be 
seen in the growth estimate for aggregate 
 potential output which, at 1.2% on average 
over the forecast horizon, is lower than in the December projection.
Under these conditions, the German economy 
is likely to expand by almost 2% this year in 
calendar-  adjusted terms, while the pace of  
growth is set to gradually decline over the next 
two years. The year-  on-  year r ates would shrink 
from 1.9% in 2014 to 1.6% in 2016. Neverthe -
less, economic growth would still significantly 
outstrip potential growth meaning that, start -
ing from normal utilisation, aggregate capacity 
utilisation would rise noticeably. At the end of 
the forecast horizon, normal capacity utilisation 
would be exceeded by almost 2%. In terms of 
unadjusted data, this pattern would translate 
into GDP growth rates of 1.9% in 2014, 2.0% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016, as calendar effects are fairly strong in some cases.
Growth expectations for 2014 have thus been 
raised slightly (by 0.2 percentage point) com-
pared to the December projection. As there

ting, this is attributable to the favourable wea -
ther conditions at the beginning of the year 
which enabled the demand overhang for con -
struction services to be reduced slightly. As the 
demand for residential construction is continu-
ing to rise sharply, hardly any negative com -
pensatory effects are expected over the course 
of the year. Furthermore, investment in ma -
chinery and equipment got off to a livelier start in 2014 than expected. The employment trend is also more favourable. The GDP growth fore-cast for 2015 remains unchanged at 2.0%.
After a very sluggish rise in the first quarter of 
2014, exports ought to return to their distinctly 
upward underlying trend. This is indicated by 
industrial firms’ continued optimistic export ex -
pectations reported by Ifo and the DIHK. Given 
stronger global expansion and a pick-  up in the 
euro area, exports could increase by 4% in 2014. This would mean that export growth 
would again exceed sales market growth by a 
small margin after clearly lagging behind in 2013. However, at 5¼% (4½% after calendar 
adjustment), growth in exports may slightly lag behind growth in sales markets in the following 
year. This is likely to remain the case in 2016. 
On the one hand, the accelerated rise in do -
mestic manufacturing costs is likely to weigh 
on the competitiveness of German exports, es -
pecially in the euro area. On the other hand, firms are likely to become increasingly aware of 
the shortage of skilled workers that is becom -
ing evident in a number of sectors and factor 
this in to their investment decisions. The greater 
availability of qualified workers in major sales 
markets could be a further reason for expand -
ing on-  site pr oduction, especially for export-  
oriented industrial firms.8
Given the upbeat sales outlook, increasing ag -
gregate capacity utilisation and exceptionally 
favourable funding conditions, business invest -
ment is set to continue on the path of recovery. 
Increased expenditure on machinery, equip-
ment and commercial properties is likely to 
stem primarily from replacement and modern -
isation projects. In addition, firms are increas -
ingly likely to invest in capacity expansion and 
to resume postponed projects, especially this 
year. However, the gloomy medium to long-  
term outlook for the labour supply, which is 
marked by demographic change, limits the 
scope for expanding domestic production cap -
acity and, as a result, growth in investment is 
likely to be weaker than in previous upturns.
The current situation on the property markets is 
characterised by high and rising demand for 
housing on the back of a sustained improve -
ment in employment and wage prospects and 
the attendant strong influx of immigrants. This 
situation is additionally boosted by the excep -
tionally favourable funding conditions. While new construction has taken off considerably 
over the past few years, the expansion of hous-
ing stock in those German urban centres that 
are particularly popular is nevertheless still fail -
ing to meet demand. This can be seen in a sharp rise in property prices.

tion measures, could go up by just over 5% in 
2014. This expansion is set to continue over the 
entire forecast horizon (albeit with slowing 
growth rates) due to the past delays in invest -
ment and consistently favourable demand-  side 
conditions.
Government investment is expected to record 
considerable growth over the forecast horizon. 
First, the government has made concrete plans 
to top up investment in transport infrastruc -
ture. Second, the relatively good financial pos-
ition of many state and local governments and 
the many identified cases of postponed invest-
ment can be interpreted as a sign that govern -
ment investment will rise distinctly.
Overall, gross fixed capital formation is likely to 
climb by 4¾% in both 2014 and 2015 and, 
after two years of weak growth, make a signifi -
cant contribution to economic growth in Ger -
many. However, in 2016 this expansion may 
slow somewhat given the level attained at this 
point.
Private consumption is also likely to provide a 
positive stimulus. After starting the year at a 
high level, consumer confidence (as measured 
by the GfK) has improved even further. This is 
due to households’ extremely high propensity 
to purchase as they are benefiting from the 
good situation on the labour market and ex-
pect to share in the improved economic per -
formance via rising real income. According to 
the present projection, households’ disposable income is expected to increase by 1½% in 2014 
in price-  adjusted terms. On the one hand, la -
bour income and employment are rising; on 
the other hand, consumer price inflation is still 
weak. In the wake of the introduction of a gen -
eral statutory minimum wage, an expansion in benefits and an expected lowering of the con -
tribution rate to the statutory pension insur -
ance scheme as well as the expected tempor -
ary cut in the contributions to the statutory health insurance institutions, real disposable 
income might even climb by just under 2% in 
2015, despite rising inflation. The saving ratio might diminish again slightly, as in previous years, thus enabling private consumption to 
rise by even more than disposable income.
Government consumption is also expected to 
rise markedly. Growth in healthcare and long-  
term care is forecast to remain strong. Further -
more, the forecast envisages spending on per -
sonnel and tangible goods purchases to grow 
broadly in line with GDP . The additional funds 
that central government has earmarked for 
childcare and education also play a role here.

pected to follow suit over the forecast horizon. 
The continued intensification of the inter -
national division of labour is also expected to 
further drive up the import content of exports 
and of other expenditure components. The 
good start to the year means that imports 
might increase by 5¼% in 2014 and possibly 
accelerate to 6¼% in 2015. Owing to their im -
proved competitive position, European manu -
facturers are expected to reap greater benefits 
from the pick-  up in demand in Germany than  
manufacturers from outside the euro area.
All in all, the forecast paints the picture of a 
cyclical upturn which is driven to a larger de -
gree than in the past by the domestic econ-
omy. Viewed from the traditional perspective, 
domestic final demand would even be the sole 
factor driving the cyclical stimulus during 
the forecast horizon (in arithmetical terms, its 
contribution to growth, at 2 percentage points 
in 2014 and 2¼ percentage points in 2015, 
 exceeds expected economic growth), while 
– after netting – a negative figure is recorded 
for exports and imports. However, it must be 
noted that imports’ negative contribution to 
growth ought to be attributed to the various 
expenditure components in line with the im -
port intensity and not only netted with ex -
ports.10 Once the breakdown has been ad -
justed accordingly, it can be approximated that 
two- thir ds of GDP growth during the forecast 
horizon is attributable to Germany and one-  
third to other countries. Taking this analysis 
one step further and factoring in the economic 
causal relationships between the variables, ris -
ing exports account for an even larger percent -
age of GDP growth. Without the additional in -
come from exports, there is no footing for con-
sumption and investment growth. Successful 
export business is key for the domestic econ -
omy to flourish in Germany, a country which is 
highly integrated in the global economy.
On the back of sharp import growth, the Ger -
man current account surplus is likely to retreat 
somewhat from the record level of 7½% of 
GDP reached in 2013 as a result, inter alia,  of weak investment. For 2015, it is expected to 
drop to 7¼%. The trade account surplus could 
dip below 6%. Any further decline is hampered 
by the anticipated continued improvement in 
the terms of trade. Furthermore, given the con-tinual increase in external assets, inflows to in -
vestment income are also expected to rise.
Labour market
In recent years, aggregate employment growth 
has been driven increasingly by sharply rising 
net immigration. In contrast to the persistently 
low wages in central and eastern European countries owing to the convergence gaps in 
the real economy, and to the crisis-  r elated 
widespread restrictions in employment pro -
spects in the countries of southern Europe, 
Germany is a relatively receptive labour market 
that is experiencing an ever-  incr easing labour 
shortage on account of demographic develop -
ments. This creates potential for a continued 
strong net influx of workers from abroad, 
 although it is likely that those faced with low 
migration costs will have already mobilised and 
that the immigration will not be entirely of a 
long-  term natur e. While net immigration in 
2014 is once again expected to be of a similarly 
large magnitude to that recorded in 2013 on 
account of labour market restrictions being 
lifted completely for Romanians and Bulgarians 
at the beginning of the year, labour market-  
driven immigration is likely to recede some -
what in 2015 and 2016. Nonetheless, the influx 
should still suffice to compensate for the demo-
graphic decline in the labour supply. By con -
trast, under the current circumstances, there is 
likely to be very little scope for an ongoing in -
crease in domestic labour force participation, 
particularly as the option of drawing a full pen -
sion at 63 can be expected to reduce participa-tion among the over-60 age group, which had risen sharply over the last fifteen years.Growth in

Given the upbeat prospect for domestic and 
foreign sales in goods and services, demand for 
labour looks set to remain strong. However, 
the wage increases triggered by the general minimum wage will probably place a burden 
on demand for labour in low-  income jobs and 
reduce employment opportunities for low-  
skilled workers, with those employed in “mini 
jobs” particularly hard hit. In many cases, the 
average number of working hours might be 
 reduced in order to stay below the monthly 
 income threshold of €450 that qualifies for 
preferential treatment in terms of social secur -
ity contributions. Thus, despite the noticeable 
constraint placed on the number of hours 
worked in this sector, the number of persons 
working in low-  income, part-  time jobs wil l 
probably not fall by much. These restrictions 
might even, to a certain extent, prompt work -
ers to switch to jobs which are subject to social 
security contributions. However, there is also 
concern that this could provoke a shift towards 
other atypical forms of employment or drive 
previously regular activities into the shadow 
economy.
Employment is expected to continue to climb 
overall, with the rather sharp pace of growth 
predicted for 2014 set to diminish in subse -
quent years on account of supply-  side short -
ages and political measures. The fall in un -
employment is likely to lose momentum in the 
course of 2014 and remain modest across the 
entire forecast horizon. In the statutory insur -
ance system, unemployment will not be far off 
its frictional lower limit. At the same time, the 
reduction in structural unemployment brought 
about by previous labour market reforms is 
likely, for the most part, to have come to a halt, 
particularly as new reforms are more likely to 
hinder the reduction of this kind of unemploy-
ment. Overall, the unemployment rate as de -
fined by the Federal Employment Agency could 
diminish from 6.9% in 2013 to 6.6% in 2014 
and to 6.4% in 2015. When calculated in line 
with international conventions, unemployment could shrink from 5.3% in 2013 to 5.1% in both 2014 and 2015, before plotting another slight 
decline in 2016.
Labour costs and prices
In view of the good economic situation, the 
anticipated tensions on the labour market as well as political measures, wage growth can 
generally be expected to pick up pace, making it felt more in terms of wage drift than negoti -
ated wage agreements. Trade unions will con -
tinue to refrain from demanding excessive gen -
eral wage increases as doing so might put manufacturing jobs that must face up to the 
international competition, but are nonetheless 
well- paid, at risk. In a similar vein, many of the 
pay agreements negotiated so far this year in-
clude an extended validity period and wage 
 adjustments in two increments, the first of 
which is quite a substantial pay rise (of around 
3%) while the second is rather more modest Strong demand

(around 2½%).11 The ongoing negotiations are 
in line with previous wage agreements, with 
demands averaging 5½% per year and experi-
ence suggesting that around half of that figure will be agreed upon. As defined in the Bundes -
bank’s negotiated pay rate statistics, this would represent an increase of just over 3% in nego -
tiated rates of pay for 2014 and slightly less in 2015. This is a marked acceleration when com -
pared with the increase of just under 2½% in 
2013. However, the rise owes something to the delayed wage agreement in the retail sector in December 2013.
The new general legal minimum wage, which 
was recently approved, will only be included directly in the Bundesbank’s negotiated pay rate statistics in exceptional cases. This is be -
cause the Bundesbank’s statistics are usually based on an agreed pay rate which presup -
poses completing vocational training and hav -
ing several years of professional experience, 
whereas the minimum wage predominantly af -
fects segments with lower qualification require -
ments. However, the introduction of the min -
imum wage is likely to fuel a noticeable in-
crease in actual earnings in 2015. Both the im -
proving economic situation and the option of 
drawing a pension at 63, which constrains the labour supply, are likely to contribute to the ex -
pected positive wage drift. Immigration, by contrast, will have the opposite effect. Employ-ment costs could be eased by reducing contri-bution rates to the statutory pension insurance scheme, with the result that compensation (per 
employee) would increase at a slightly slower pace than actual earnings in 2015. Capacity 
utilisation could send employment costs on a 
steeper trajectory in 2016.
The stronger upward movement in wages is 
likely to push up the underlying trend in do -
mestically generated inflation. However, the 
rise in the GDP deflator in 2014 should ease 
perceptibly at first, compared with the high 
rate in 2013, which was driven by significant 
improvements in the terms of trade. The more 
favourable import prices are being gradually 
passed through to the final purchasers, nar -
rowing margins again. Aside from these short-  
term fluctuations, the current projection sug -
gests that the wage share will remain largely 
unchanged.
The increased upward pressure on consumer prices, which stems from the domestic econ -
omy, will initially be masked by other effects. In 
light of the improved weather conditions, food 
price inflation is even set to decrease signifi -
cantly compared with the two previous years. 
The appreciation of the euro will initially con -
tinue to have an effect on prices for industrial 
goods (excluding energy). Only services prices 
and housing rents are already picking up per-
ceptibly. Looking ahead, the accelerated in -
crease in prices should gradually spread, with the domestic component continuing to over -
shadow the external component in the forecast 
outlined here. The new general minimum wage 
will also be a contributing factor here. Exclud -
ing energy, consumer price inflation could in -
crease from 1.3% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2016.Wage drift

agreements concluded in previous years are analysed and

The forecast for energy prices is mainly dictated 
by assumptions for crude oil prices and ex -
change rates, which indicate that prices for 
mineral oil products will follow a downward 
path. Shrinking gas and heat energy prices are 
also to be expected in such a market environ -
ment. With regard to electricity, the additional expenses caused by growing levies to promote renewable energy should be much lower than 
in the past and should be partly offset by lower 
purchase prices for energy supply companies. 
Thus, following a decline of 1.0% in 2014, en -
ergy prices for households could fall by a fur -
ther 0.8% in 2015 and possibly ease again 
slightly in 2016.
Under these conditions, HICP inflation for Ger -
man consumers would amount to 1.1% in 
2014, 1.5% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. Despite 
what remains a rather subdued overall ten -
dency in Germany, these figures would be dis -
tinctly higher than the average rate of inflation 
in other euro-  ar ea countries.
Public finances
In 2013, general government again recorded a 
small surplus (following the revision by the Fed-
eral Statistical Office in May: +0.2% of GDP). 
Public finances continued to reap the benefits 
of low interest rates and low unemployment. In 
light of the weak upturn in economic output 
on an annual average, the surplus was some-
what higher after cyclical adjustment.12 Public 
finances will benefit from cyclical factors in the 
forecast period.13 The structural deterioration in 
the budget on account of the expansionary fis -
cal measures until 2015 will be largely masked by these cyclical factors as well as by a further 
decrease in the interest burden. The close-  to- 
neutral fiscal stance charted for 2016 onwards means that factors providing ongoing relief will 
prevail; besides economic activity, these not -
ably include the shrinking interest expenditure 
ratio and fiscal drag14. This would improve the 
general government budget and generate a marked, albeit largely cyclically induced, sur -
plus.
The expectation that the financial balance will 
change only slightly in 2014 and 2015 is based on various, in some cases countervailing, devel-
opments. Although fiscal drag will drive rev -
enue higher, this will be counterbalanced by losses brought about by the aforementioned cut in income taxes and contributions to the statutory pension and health insurance 
schemes. Moreover, revenue from profit-  r elated 
taxes in 2014 might rise from the high level Falling energy

Monthly Report, March 2006, pp 61-76.13 Based on the underlying projection, cyclical factors will 
once again have a neutral impact on the fiscal balance in 
2014 before turning increasingly positive thereafter.14 In this context, the term “fiscal drag” encompasses not 
only the positive revenue effects of bracket creep in income 
taxation, but also the negative impact of specific excise 
 duties being largely independent of prices.Deutsche Bundesbank

 already reached, albeit at a much slower pace 
than nominal GDP . Overall, the revenue ratio is 
likely to diminish slightly. The expenditure ratio will be depressed by cyclically accelerated GDP 
growth in the denominator, shrinking un -
employment and a further relief in the debt ser -
vicing burden (owing to diminishing average remuneration and the decreasing debt ratio). 
By contrast, the cyclically adjusted primary ex -
penditure ratio might even rise somewhat. This 
is the outcome of increased expenditure brought about by the recent pension legisla -
tion, higher spending on healthcare and long-  
term care and a boost to central government 
funds for transport infrastructure, childcare, 
education and research. Overall, the favourable economic situation and the decreasing interest burden mask a marked deterioration in the cyc -
lically adjusted primary balance.
From the current perspective, central, state and 
local government budgets are set to improve 
gradually overall. Besides the favourable eco -nomic situation, this owes something to the 
 relief brought about by fiscal drag and the debt 
servicing burden. By contrast, social security 
funds’ budgets are likely to deteriorate on bal-ance and slip into the red as of 2015. Although 
they, too, benefit from economic activity, the 
pension and health insurance schemes’ large 
reserves are likely to be quickly depleted on 
 account of stronger growth in spending com -
bined with temporary cuts in contribution 
rates. The additional pension benefits will only 
be partially discernible in the financial balance 
as these will also be financed –  ceteris paribus – 
through higher contribution rates and lower 
general pension adjustments.
Given the relatively good fiscal positions of 
central, state and local government as well as 
GDP growth in the denominator, the forecast 
envisages a considerable decline in the debt 
ratio. As things currently stand, this comes on 
top of continued portfolio reduction at 
government-  owned bad banks. Compar ed 
with this, the further (debt-  i ncreasing) capital 
transfers to the ESM and to EFSF assistance loans
15 still envisaged for 2014 are relatively 
small. Overall, the debt ratio could fall to below 
70% by 2016. However, despite the sustained 
favourable conditions for government budgets, 
the 60% threshold is still likely to be exceeded 
by far.
Risk assessment
Past experience shows that economic forecasts 
are fraught with considerable uncertainty. This 
applies in equal measure to the Bundesbank’s 
projections, as explained in the box on pages  25-28. Therefore, point forecasts are 
augmented by uncertainty intervals founded 
on past forecast errors. Additionally, a risk pro -

How informative are the point forecasts 
in the Bundesbank’s macroeconomic projections?
Point forecasts of major macroeconomic 
variables are a key part of the Bundesbank’s 
macroeconomic projections which, along 
with the projections of the other Eurosys-tem central banks, are incorporated into the euro- area forecasts published by the 
European Central Bank. The general public 
often focuses on the point forecasts for the 
annual rates of change of gross domestic 
product (GDP) and consumer price infl  ation as measured by the HICP .
The quality of a forecast is mostly judged by 
its accuracy both with regard to how much 
it differs from the realised values and in  relation to competing projections. One measure of this is, for example, the mean 
absolute error (MAE) of the forecasts. More-
over, a forecasting method is usually 
 regarded as informative only if it produces 
smaller errors, on average, than would be the case when simply extrapolating the 
 historical mean.1
Such a mean value forecast thus represents a “natural” barrier. A forecast which fails to overcome this barrier, thus producing larger 
errors than the mean value, shows either 
that the methodology used is inadequate or that the target variable can be forecast only 
with great diffi   culty from a given horizon onwards. Shocks –  which, by their very  nature, cannot be predicted  – are one 
 reason for this.
Even if forecasts for certain variables or 
horizons are not deemed to be informative 
in the strict sense, there should at least be 
no systematic upward or downward bias. The errors should therefore offset each 
other over time and be nearly zero on aver-
age. The errors themselves are defi  ned as the difference between the projected and realised values. Owing to the provisional 
nature of the initially published fi  gures and 
subsequent revisions due to an improved information base, particularly for GDP , the data available one year later are used as 
realised values for the following analysis.2
Given that, starting with the present out-
look, the published forecast horizon is being 
extended by one year for the Eurosystem 
staff projections (in this case, up to 2016),3 
the questions raised in the introduction concerning accuracy, informativeness and 
degree of bias are pertinent for such a wide forecasting horizon.
 The charts on the following page show the 
MAE and the mean error (bias) of real GDP 
and consumer prices for each current year 
(forecasting horizon h=0) and the two fol-
lowing years (h=1, h=2) with the projections 
being fi  nalised in autumn (third week of 
November) and spring (third week of May) 
for the period from 1999 to 2013. As a 
benchmark, the forecast by Consensus Eco-
1 In a formal sense, a forecast is informative if the vari-
ance of the forecast error is smaller than the variance 
of the variable to be forecast. See M P Clements and 
D F Hendry (1998), Forecasting Economic Time Series, pp 84-87. Implicit in this defi  nition is the ex post mean value (in this case, over the period from 1999 to 2013), which was not yet known at the time when the fore-
cast was prepared (in the autumn of 2007, for ex-ample). The present descriptive analysis is based on 
this defi  nition. In principle, however, the ex ante mean 
value should serve as a reference value for statistical signifi  cance analyses. Nevertheless, in this case, too, the chosen reference period should be of suffi   cient 
length to limit the impact of “extreme values” such as the severe recession in 2009.2 This convention may also be found in European Cen-

nomics is used, which is produced by aver-
aging various individual projections by re-
search institutions and other professional forecasters.
4 Such combined forecasts are 
generally  accurate as the risk of major fore-
cast errors is reduced.5 The MAE of the 
Consensus forecast therefore sets an ambi-tious benchmark.
In comparison with Consensus, it is evident 
that the Bundesbank projections –  meas-
ured by the MAE – perform well for the cur-
rent year and, with certain qualifi  cations, 
for the following year as well. The MAE is 
on a par with that of Consensus Econom-
ics.6 From the spring projection for the fol-
lowing year, however, the MAE of the Bun-
desbank’s projections is some 10% to 20% 
above that of the Consensus forecast; the informativeness of both institutions’ fore-
casts also diminishes signifi  cantly. The MAE 
is above that of the mean value forecast. 
This applies, in particular, to the projection 
of GDP , but to a lesser extent to the infl  a-
tion forecast as well. As regards the size of the errors, it should be noted that the crisis and upturn years of 2009 and 2010 
accounted for a considerable proportion of almost 30% of the MAE.
Furthermore, an analysis of the forecast errors shows that only the projections for 
the current year are to be classifi  ed as un-
biased. The estimations for one year and 
two years ahead are, by contrast, too opti-
mistic: there is a tendency to overestimate 
real GDP growth and to underestimate the

rise in consumer prices.7 Only the Consen-
sus forecast of prices appears to be more or 
less unbiased for a horizon of two years.
Upon closer inspection of the underlying time period from 1999 to 2013, the Bun-desbank’s one- year and two- year ahead 
projections of real GDP can be classifi  ed as cautiously optimistic. Growth rates of under 1.2% were mostly overestimated, especially in the period from 2001 to 2005 and in the 
recession year of 2009, while higher rates were systematically underestimated. By comparison, consumer prices were invari-
ably underestimated, except for the projec-
tions for 2009 which were prepared in 
2007 and 2008. For 2002, 2003 and 2013 
the projections were, however, remarkably 
accurate across all horizons.
For longer forecasting horizons, the Bun-
desbank’s projections – as mentioned earl-
ier – fall somewhat short of those prepared 
by Consensus Economics. Nevertheless, a 
fair comparison for such horizons is possible only with some qualifi  cation. In the Bundes-bank’s projection, path dependency plays a 
key role, for example. Today’s forecast for tomorrow also infl  uences today’s forecast 
for the day after tomorrow. This means that errors are, to some degree, transferred from 
one forecasting horizon to another. This is 
true only to a certain extent for the Consen-
sus forecast, since its path dependency is 
partly neutralised by averaging a large num-ber of individual forecasts.
Furthermore, external assumptions have a major impact on the projection outcome. 
The projections of the Eurosystem national 
central banks are conditioned on uniform, jointly defi  ned assumptions about interest 
rates, exchange rates, sales market growth, 
foreign competitors’ prices and oil prices.8 
The chart at the bottom of the previous 
page shows that the Bundesbank’s projec-tions for the HICP excluding energy are 
largely unbiased across all forecasting hori-
zons. The tendency to understate infl  ation 
in the Bundesbank’s projections can there-
fore be attributed mostly to the jointly de-
fi  ned oil price assumptions within the Euro-
system. The projections excluding the en-
ergy component are also more informative 
than the overall index. Only the MAE of the 
last projected year is above that of the 
mean value forecast.9
In order to examine the impact of the exter-
nal assumptions in greater depth, all the Bundesbank’s projections from 2006 on-
wards were recalculated using the “correct” 
assumptions, ie the subsequently realised 
values of the conditioning variables. To do 
this, corresponding shocks were inserted in the Bundesbank’s macroeconometric model 
and their effects on the projection pub-
lished at that particular point in time were 
determined.10 From this, it is then possible 
to identify how far the most important con-
ditioning variables infl  uenced the forecast errors between 2006 and 2013. In each case, there remains an error which –  ac-
cording to the model calculations – cannot 
be attributed to the assumptions. This breakdown into potential causes is shown

the same conclusion. See European Central Bank, An

in the chart above. For real GDP , the 
 assumption about sales market growth (and 
thus about global economic activity) drives 
the forecast errors most strongly; in the case 
of consumer prices, it is, as expected, the 
price of oil. Interest rate assumptions have a 
relatively minor impact. It is striking that the 
assumption- related errors are  lessened by 
the non- assumption- related  residual. How-
ever, it is only for a horizon of two quarters or longer that the conditioning assumptions 
determine the projection to a greater ex-tent. A factor in this instance is that the 
forecasts of purely statistical models play a 
larger part over short horizons.11All things considered, the question as to the 
informativeness of the Bundesbank’s pro-jections for the current year and, in the  autumn projection, for the following year 
can indeed meet with a positive response: 
applying the strict defi  nition used here, the point forecasts are informative and they are competitive. Longer horizons, as is also the case for other institutions, suffer from larger 
forecast errors and biases with a tendency 
to overestimate real GDP and to underesti-mate consumer price infl  ation. Model simu-lations point to a marked impact exerted by the jointly defi  ned assumptions in the Euro-
system, especially with regard to the infl  a-
tion forecasts. Against this backdrop, the 
longer horizon used from this round of pro-
jections onwards is designed mainly to model macroeconomic developments in a 
setting where earlier disruptions are reced-
ing and new disruptions are absent.

The present projection assumes that global 
economic growth will firm and that the euro 
area will recover gradually. Compared with this 
baseline scenario, risks are predominantly on the downside. The threat of geopolitical ten-sions has risen perceptibly in recent months 
and, if the situation flares up, uncertainty is 
likely to spread more quickly once again and 
put the upturn in investment at risk. Addition-
ally, there is still a residual risk of financial mar -
kets triggering abrupt adjustment processes in 
emerging market economies. And lastly, the 
nascent recovery process in the euro area is fra -
gile and needs to be bolstered further by eco -
nomic policy reform measures. Thus, the as -
sumptions underlying the projection for sales 
market growth and the path for exports de -
rived therefrom should be seen as optimistic.
Opportunities and risks for economic growth in 
the domestic economy chiefly concern the 
 labour market. The present projection assumes 
that the reserves in the domestic labour market 
are largely exhausted, that the latest political 
measures diminish potential labour input and that immigration will gradually recede. If the 
supply-  side conditions prove more favourable 
than assumed here, GDP growth is likely to be stronger and wage pressure weaker. In a scen -
ario in which shortages increase more rapidly, 
for instance because immigration decreases at 
a faster pace, wages, at least, would rise more 
quickly and real economic growth could fall 
short of the path outlined here.
A distinction also needs to be drawn between 
external and domestic risks for the price projec -
tion. This first raises the question whether the 
decline in crude oil prices derived from forward 
prices is consistent with a scenario of increas -
ing global economic growth. Moreover, the ap -
preciation of the euro in recent months has in -
creased the likelihood of a rebound. Thus, the German HICP rate is predominantly faced with 
upside risks from the external setting. The 
 degree to which price inflation is being driven 
domestically is dictated primarily by the extent 
of shortages in the labour market. The corres-
ponding uncertainties also shape the risk pro -
file of the inflation forecast.External risks to

Europe’s new recovery and resolution 
regime for credit institutions
Since the onset of the financial crisis back in 2007, governments looking to preserve financial sta -
bility have repeatedly been forced to use public funds to bail out credit institutions that had run 
into difficulties. In an effort to prevent such bail-  outs going forwar d, and also to facilitate the 
resolution of more complex banks without resorting to tax resources, policymakers joined forces 
at the global level to define a set of key attributes for resolution regimes. In the European Union 
(EU), two legislative projects were rolled out to put this initiative into practice – first, the Bank 
Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), a piece of legislation which applies across the entire 
Union and harmonises the recovery and resolution toolkit but leaves its use to the national reso -
lution authorities, and second, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The latter builds on the tools created by the BRRD and augments the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism 
(SSM) for banks, a process which is already well on the way to completion. Banks in member 
states participating in the SSM – ie member states which have adopted the euro as their currency 
as well as any non-  eur o-  ar ea member states that “opt in” to the SSM – are subject to the SRM, 
an institutional mechanism with a Single Resolution Board (SRB) at the European level as well as a Single Resolution Fund (SRF). Contributions to the SRF raised at the national level will be pro -
gressively mutualised over a transitional period of eight years.
The BRRD represents a major step towards restoring the principles of the market economy, which 
dictate that if a credit institution fails, its shareholders and creditors should be first in line to 
absorb the attendant risks and losses before a dedicated resolution fund financed by the banking 
industry steps in. This is an objective which the BRRD chiefly seeks to achieve through the new 
bail- in tool, though it does al low exceptions to the rule that losses should be absorbed primarily 
by shareholders and creditors. The SRM forms part of the broader banking union reform project 
and is a crucial pillar complementing the SSM, which, having already been adopted, is set to take 
charge of supervising euro-  ar ea banks in November 2014. The introduction of the SRM means 
that liability and control are two sides of the same coin once more. However, the set-  up which 
legislators have now arrived at has a complex set of institutional decision-  making mechanisms, 
and the prevailing primary law framework means that it involves legal risk. The SRM in its current 
form should therefore merely be a stepping stone towards creating a robust foundation under 
primary law. It remains a matter for policymakers to do what is necessary to encourage perman-ently sustainable policymaking going forward. This presupposes that the scope for influencing the quality of bank balance sheets on the one hand and responsibility for the repercussions of bank insolvencies on the other are aligned at the same level – not just for bank failures that lie ahead, but equally so for the legacy assets which already exist in the banking sectors.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background to the two sets 
of legislation
Events since the onset of the financial crisis 
back in 2007 have vividly demonstrated the im -
portance of setting up a dedicated resolution 
regime for credit institutions. It became plain 
during the crisis that initiating insolvency pro -
ceedings over an insolvent or over-  i ndebted 
credit institution can have severe repercussions 
for the financial system as a whole owing to 
that bank’s interconnectedness with other mar -
ket players (a concept known as contagion). These contagion effects eroded confidence 
among banks, and because they also impaired key functions which banks perform for the real 
economy (accepting deposits, granting credit, 
processing payments), they spread beyond the 
financial sector, causing the crisis to spill over 
into the real economy. This was one of the main reasons why the financial crisis evolved into one of the most severe recessions since 
the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s.
This perilous state of affairs was exacerbated 
by structural change within the banking sector. 
Over the past decades, business models in some quarters of the EU banking sector have drifted away from the traditional focus on 
credit and deposit business and increasingly to -
wards trading/capital market operations. So when the financial crisis erupted in 2007, the 
EU banking sector was significantly larger, more 
complex, more interconnected and more inte -
grated across national borders than before. These banks were not just oversized – they were also too interconnected and altogether 
too important for the economy as a whole for 
it to appear conceivable that they could go bankrupt without severely impacting on both the financial system and the real economy 
(“too big to fail”).
As the crisis evolved, European governments, in 
an effort to diminish such inestimable systemic 
aftershocks, had no option but to roll out bail-  
out programmes to prop up banks threatened 
with insolvency. These bail-  outs came in differ -ent shapes and forms. In some cases, ailing in -
stitutions conducted capital increases to allow 
governments to take an equity stake and thereby strengthen their capital base. Else -
where, governments issued guarantees to back assets or liabilities.
The unprecedented scale of government assis-
tance raised hopes among banks that they 
would be rescued, providing fertile ground for 
market distortions and inefficiencies. After all, if 
investors anticipate that losses will be social -
ised, that is, taken off their backs, they might 
be encouraged to engage in riskier behaviour 
than would be economically efficient (moral 
hazard). Besides inflicting damage on the over -
all economy, such behaviour also provokes 
widespread public and political resistance and 
undermines the willingness to accept funda -
mental market economy principles. So it is no 
surprise that the bail-  outs r epeatedly came in 
for sharp public criticism. In view of this re -
sponse, the overriding objective of the meas -
ures taken must be to make banks more crisis-  
proof and to allow insolvent institutions to be 
wound up without taxpayer support. That way, 
risks and opportunities would once again be 
aligned at the same level, just as the principles 
of a market economy would have it.
The idea behind the new resolution regime for 
banks is to overcome the dilemma of deciding 
between systemically risky insolvency proceed-
ings on the one hand and economically and 
politically questionable bail-  outs on the other . 
Its aim is to provide a set of resolution tools 
that facilitate the resolution of banks without 
resorting to taxpayers’ money.
This topic was addressed at the global level 
after the outbreak of the crisis, most promin -
ently under the auspices of the Financial Stabil -
ity Board (FSB), a body comprising govern -
ments, financial supervisory authorities and 
central banks from the 24 most important in -
dustrial and emerging market economies 
worldwide. International and supranational in -

Commission and the European Central Bank 
(ECB) also participated in deliberations. The 
G20 tasked the FSB with drawing up an inter -
national policy framework for the recovery and 
resolution of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). In October 2011, the FSB 
presented the Key Attributes of Effective Reso -
lution Regimes for Financial Institutions (KA), 
which were endorsed by the G20.1 This docu -
ment outlines the criteria which the resolution 
regimes operated by the participating jurisdic -
tions need to satisfy. One notable requirement 
is that the participating jurisdictions set up resolution authorities and equip them with 
tools which facilitate the orderly resolution of 
financial institutions without taxpayer expos -
ure. The KA set out the core elements of the envisaged tools, the principles to be applied, 
and the cross-  bor der interaction between par -
ticipating authorities. The FSB’s member coun -
tries have committed to transpose the KA into 
national law by 2015, a process that will also 
see the rules being fleshed out in greater detail. 
Hence, the KA represent a crucial step towards 
resolving the global “too big to fail” problem.
The initiative coincided in the EU with the joint 
statement by the Heads of State or Govern-
ment in 2012 that they intended to strengthen 
European Economic and Monetary Union by 
adding a banking union which would comprise 
a single banking supervision mechanism, a joint 
framework for recovering and winding up 
credit institutions and greater harmonisation of 
deposit guarantee schemes. Work on the first 
pillar of this banking union, the Single Supervis -
ory Mechanism, which transfers prudential 
 responsibility to the ECB, is already under way, 
the associated Regulation having come into 
 effect back in November 2013. The SSM’s 
supervisory activities are scheduled to be fully 
operational on 4 November 2014.2 As  r egards 
the third pillar – deposit protection – a com -
promise has been reached for a Directive that 
will further harmonise the national deposit 
guarantee schemes.Legislative processes
The KA are neither legally binding nor are they 
directly applicable in the participating jurisdic -
tions. So their practical applicability is condi -
tional on the respective jurisdictions enacting 
legislation to transpose them into national law. 
This is a path which the EU, in its capacity as a 
jurisdiction, also committed to follow, but its 
undertaking was of a political rather than a 
legal nature.
Accordingly, on 6  June 2012 the European 
Commission presented a proposal for a Direct -
ive establishing a framework for the recovery 
and resolution of credit institutions (Bank Re -
covery and Resolution Directive, or BRRD)3 and 
on 10  July 2013 presented a proposal for a Regulation establishing a uniform regime for 
resolving banks (Single Resolution Mechanism 
Regulation).4
The two documents represent distinct pieces of 
legislation, legally speaking, but the SRM Regu -
lation builds on the provisions of the BRRD. The 
BRRD applies across all 28 member states of the EU and harmonises substantive resolution 
law – that is to say, it provides a set of reso -
lution tools and contains related legal provi -
sions governing matters such as recovery and 
resolution planning and early intervention. But

powers at the national level and, accordingly, 
provides for the establishment of national reso-
lution authorities and resolution financing ar -
rangements by those member states that have 
not already done so. From the perspective of 
European law, the BRRD is a directive that 
needs to be transposed into national law by 
way of national legislation in order to be ap -
plied.
The SRM Regulation, by contrast, additionally 
transfers the decision-  making pr ocess to the 
European level. It establishes a European reso -
lution board with powers that can be exercised 
by national resolution authorities under the 
BRRD framework. In keeping with this object -
ive, the SRM will be established as a directly 
effective EU Regulation. Where the BRRD con -
fers options and discretion on member states, 
such options and discretion shall be exercised 
by the SRM Regulation in a certain manner. 
Even though the SRM Regulation is applicable 
across all 28 member states, the SRM does not, 
to all intents and purposes, cover all of them, 
only those also participating in the SSM. So 
strictly speaking, only the SRM, and not the 
BRRD, is part of the banking union project, an 
initiative which only covers euro-  ar ea member 
states and countries which choose (“opt in”) to 
cooperate closely with the ECB in banking 
supervisory matters. Nonetheless, it only makes sense to view the two sets of legislation in con-
junction with one another because, in terms of 
substantive law, they largely cover the same 
ground.
Both pieces of legislation are to be enacted on 
the basis of Article 114 TFEU (approximation of 
laws in the internal market) and therefore 
 require Council and Parliament approval in 
 accordance with the ordinary legislative pro -
cedure. Trilogue negotiations among the EU’s 
legislative bodies were successfully concluded 
at the end of March 2014, this political agree -
ment forming the basis for the plenary of the 
European Parliament to approve both sets of 
legislation on 15 April. The BRRD was published 
in the Official Journal of the EU on 12  June 2014.5 Should any of the small print of the SRM 
Regulation need to be changed, the necessary 
corrigendum can be approved by the inaugural plenary session of the newly elected Parliament 
(following the European elections) before the Council submits its formal vote. This means 
that the SRM Regulation can also be published 
in the Official Journal before the end of this 
summer.
During negotiations on the SRM Regulation, it 
also came to light that key questions surround -
ing the mutualisation of resolution financing 
cannot be addressed by way of an EU Regula -
tion but necessitate a separate intergovern -
mental agreement (IGA), a matter which is dis-
cussed later in this article. That is why an IGA 
was hammered out alongside the SRM Regula -
tion and signed by all the member states, with 
the exception of the UK and Sweden, on 
21  May 2014. The next step is a ratification 
procedure in accordance with the national con-
stitutional requirements.
Bank Recovery and 
 Resolution Directive (BRRD)
General information
The BRRD is applicable to institutions that are 
established in the EU, that is, credit institutions 
and investment firms (Article 1 (1) letter a, Art -
icle 2 (23) BRRD). For the purposes of the BRRD, 
the term “credit institution” refers to deposit-  
taking and the granting of credit as defined in 
European law – that is to say that not all enter -
prises that satisfy the broader definition set forth under German law (section 1 (1) of the 
German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz)  ) are 
covered by the BRRD. Other entities covered by 
the BRRD include EU-  based branches of institu -
tions that are established outside the European Union as well as certain financial holding com-
panies, mixed financial holding companies, 
mixed holding companies and parent financial Trilogue

holding companies and financial institutions 
(details can be found in Article 1 (1) letters b to 
e BRRD).
Much like the existing national legal frame -
works – such as Germany’s Credit Institution 
Reorganisation Act6 – the BRRD likewise makes 
a fundamental distinction between two differ -
ent sets of proceedings which can be initiated 
if an institution experiences financial difficulties 
and which are already reflected in the Direc -
tive’s name: recovery, and resolution in the nar -
rower sense of the term.
Recovery proceedings
Recovery proceedings are characterised by the 
fact that they are conducted independently by 
the institution itself. To this end, the institution 
can avail itself of a non-  exhaustive r ange of op -
tions set forth by the BRRD. For instance, cer -
tain of the institution’s assets or lines of busi -
ness can be sold to different entities, or certain 
activities can be discontinued, reorganised or 
downsized. Common to all recovery measures 
is that they are solely private-  law arr angements 
that do not involve any sovereign or official 
powers. Hence, they do not permit any inter -
ventions in the rights of investors (shareholders 
or creditors) against their will. As part of their 
early intervention powers, supervisory author -
ities can require an institution to take recovery 
action.
If an institution runs into difficulties, valuable time can be lost if senior management only 
then begins to map out its road to recovery. 
That is why Article 5 BRRD requires institutions 
to draw up and maintain recovery plans. The 
measures to be taken as part of the recovery 
process need to be developed and prepared in 
these recovery plans upfront –  ie before a 
 recovery event occurs – so that the institution 
can draw on a previously prepared action plan, 
if need be. Unlike under current German law, 
which only requires institutions that potentially 
pose a systemic risk to prepare a recovery plan, the BRRD essentially asks all institutions to do 
so; however, banks which are members of a group that is supervised by a consolidating supervisor do not need to prepare individual plans because they are instead included in a 
group recovery plan (Article 7 BRRD). Small in -
stitutions – notably those which, like the Ger -
man savings banks and credit cooperatives, are members of an institutional protection scheme 
or which, if wound up, would be unlikely to adversely impact on financial stability  – are 
governed by a simplified set of recovery plan -
ning obligations (Article  4 BRRD). Recovery 
plans must be updated at least annually or in 
the event of significant changes and must be submitted to the competent authority for 
review. Where the competent authority  assesses  
that there are deficiencies in the  r ecovery plan, 
the authority can ask the institution to remedy 
these shortcomings and also direct the institu -
tion to take measures such as changes to its 
governance structure or risk profile.
Groups looking to ready themselves for finan -
cial difficulties that might materialise at some point in the future also have the option of 
drawing up agreements governing the granting 
of financial support among group entities, 
 although such arrangements are subject to 
supervisory review.
Early intervention
Addressing financial difficulties before they 
pose a significant threat is one of the main ob -
jectives of the BRRD, which is why the section 
of the BRRD entitled “Early intervention” (Art -
icles 27 to 30) gives the competent authorities 
a broad range of additional powers to inter -
vene in institutions. Authorities can notably ask 
an institution to change its business strategy, 
appoint a temporary administrator or demand BRRD governs 
both recovery and resolution proceedings

that measures set out in the recovery plan be 
implemented.
Resolution
Ideally, banking supervisors, by intervening 
early on, will be able to ensure that an institu -
tion has sufficient internal capital adequacy or 
the bank, by following the prudential recom -
mendations, will succeed in regaining its resili -
ence through recovery proceedings. However, 
extreme cases –  circumstances in which the 
above-  mentioned courses of action do not suf -
fice or any attempt at recovery is destined to 
fail – cannot be ruled out, meaning that meas -
ures extending as far as allowing interventions 
in shareholder and creditor rights against their will might be needed. Such interventions are of 
a sovereign nature, hence the need for an 
 authority to be involved which has statutory 
powers, ie ones that override contractual 
 arrangements. Resolution proceedings and the 
resolution authority serve this purpose. When 
applying resolution tools and exercising reso -
lution powers, resolution authorities shall have 
regard to the resolution  objectives set forth in 
Article  31 BRRD. These objectives comprise 
 ensuring the continuity of critical functions; 
avoiding significant adverse effects on financial 
stability, in particular by preventing contagion; 
protecting public funds by minimising reliance 
on extraordinary public  fi nancial support; pro -
tecting depositors with deposits covered by 
 deposit guarantees; and protecting client funds 
and client assets.
Resolution is another area in which planning 
takes place upfront as this simplifies the task of selecting the most appropriate course of action 
in an emergency. Crucially, unlike recovery planning, the resolution authority must draw 
up the resolution plan rather than the institu -
tion (Article  10 BRRD), with Article  11 BRRD 
 requiring institutions to cooperate with reso -
lution authorities and provide them with all the 
requisite information. Again, there are simpli -
fied obligations for smaller institutions and the option of treating group institutions as part of a group resolution plan.
The process leading up to the preparation of 
the resolution plan might bring to light impedi -
ments that could hamper orderly resolution 
proceedings. For instance, it is conceivable that an institution might have different lines of busi-
ness which are interconnected to such an ex -
tent that it would be virtually impossible to 
gauge the systemic repercussions of resolution 
proceedings. That is why the BRRD instructs 
resolution authorities to assess institutions’ re -
solvability; should there be any shortcomings in 
an institution’s resolvability, resolution author -
ities have the power to require that institution 
to address or remove any such impediments 
(Article 17 BRRD). The resolvability assessment 
is combined with recovery and resolution plan -
ning as part of an iterative process. This process necessitates close cooperation between super -
visory and resolution authorities. For instance, 
if the supervisory authority has any doubts over the feasibility of a recovery plan presented to it, it must encourage changes to be made which impact positively on both resolvability and reso -
lution planning. By the same token, insights which the resolution authority gains from its 
 resolvability assessment might be a catalyst for 
changes in recovery and resolution plans.
Resolution proceedings can only be initiated if 
all three of the conditions (or triggers) set forth in Article 32 (1) BRRD are met.
– The institution is failing or is likely to fail. This criterion, which is fleshed out in greater de -
tail in Article 32 (4) BRRD, looks beyond the 
institution’s over-  indebtedness and solvency 
to also consider infringements of require -
ments for continuing authorisation, such as 
a loss which depletes all or a significant amount of its own funds. Additionally, the 
criterion “failing” or “likely to fail” is deemed 
to have been satisfied if an institution re -
ceives extraordinary public financial support, 
except where certain exceptions apply. This Resolution pro-

provision is designed to deter early bail-  
outs.7
– There is no reasonable prospect that any al -
ternative private sector measures or super -
visory action (such as early intervention 
measures) would prevent the failure of the institution within a reasonable timeframe. This arrangement is particularly important 
from a German perspective because 
institution-  based pr otection schemes, which 
are found predominantly in Germany’s credit 
cooperative and savings bank sectors, are 
explicitly mentioned as alternative measures. 
This is a sensible approach because experi -
ence has shown that failures of member in -
stitutions of such networks can be prevented 
efficiently and often less expensively by the 
respective institutional protection schemes. 
This arrangement underscores the nature of 
the resolution regime as a last resort.
– Resolution is necessary in the public interest. This criterion draws a comparison with nor -
mal insolvency proceedings. Resolution pro -
ceedings are in the public interest only if they are necessary to achieve and are pro-
portionate to one or more of the resolution 
objectives, and winding up the institution under insolvency proceedings would not 
meet those resolution objectives to the same extent. The criterion shows that the existing insolvency legislation is not crowded out by the new resolution regime but that an add -
itional option has been created – in the 
event of a concrete bank failure, a case-  by-  
case assessment should be carried out to 
determine whether insolvency or resolution 
proceedings are to be initiated. The “no 
creditor worse off than under normal insolv-
ency proceedings” principle shall be re -
spected.
Once the resolution conditions have been met and resolution proceedings have been initiated, 
the resolution authority can deploy a host of resolution tools to achieve the stated object -ives. These tools are listed in Article  37  (3) 
BRRD. Specifically, they are as follows.
– Sale of business tool
– Bridge institution tool
– Asset separation tool
– Bail- in tool
The tools can be used individually or in any 
combination, the only exception being the 
asset separation tool, which may only be used 
together with another resolution tool.
Articles 56 et seq BRRD state that government 
financial stabilisation tools may also be used, 
albeit as a last resort. Effectively, these tools are 
government bail-  outs sanctioned by the BRRD. 
Given that this runs counter to the objectives of 
the BRRD, such government financial stabilisa -
tion tools may only be deployed after the other 
resolution tools have been assessed and ex -
ploited to the maximum extent practicable.
The sale of business tool is the mechanism 
used for effecting a transfer of some or all of 
the shares issued by an institution under reso -
lution, or some or all of its assets, rights or li -
abilities, to a recipient. In effect, this tool con -
stitutes the sale of business activities to another 
institution in return for a consideration deter -
mined by way of a prior valuation. This facili -
tates the continuation of critical functions by a 
different institution. There is no need to obtain the consent of the institution under resolution

7 Here, the BRRD provides a key transitional arrangement 
on the path towards the launch of the banking union. 
Under certain circumstances, extraordinary public financial support does not trigger a resolution event if it is of a pre -
cautionary and temporary nature and it is proportionate to 
remedy the consequences of serious disturbances. This 
provision primarily addresses the stress tests conducted by 
the European Banking Authority and the asset quality re -
view which is currently taking place under the auspices of the ECB at those banks which are scheduled to be subject 
to direct ECB supervision as of November 2014 (see also 
the wording of Article 32 (4) letter d BRRD). This arrange -
ment allows capital shortfalls which come to light under these proceedings to be addressed through injections of public funds, if necessary, thereby allowing the banking 
union to be launched free of legacy risks. The details of the 
precise conditions in which such recapitalisations can be 
made without triggering a resolution event are still a sub -
ject of debate.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

nor that of its shareholders, creditors or debt -
ors whose claims and liabilities are transferred 
because the resolution authority effects the 
sale of business in a sovereign capacity; the 
consent of the recipient is required, however.
As an alternative to seeking a recipient in the 
market that is willing to acquire such business 
or in the absence of such a recipient, the reso-
lution authority also has the option of estab -
lishing a bridge institution with a view to main -
taining critical functions. Some or all of the 
shares issued by the institution under reso -
lution, or some or all of its assets, rights or 
 liabilities, can be transferred to a bridge institu -
tion but the total value of liabilities transferred 
to the bridge institution may not exceed the 
total value of the rights and assets. Here too, 
an appropriate purchase price informed by prior valuation shall be paid. The main differ -
ence between this tool and the sale of business 
tool is that the resolution authority establishes 
and operates the bridge institution specifically 
for this purpose (Article 41, Article 40 (2) BRRD); 
however, there is also the option of establish -
ing a bridge institution without a specific need 
as a “shelf corporation” in order to respond 
more quickly to a critical situation – Germany’s 
Restructuring Fund Act already allows the 
 Financial Market Stabilisation Agency, or FMSA, 
to do so. The bridge institution or its assets, 
rights or liabilities should be sold as soon as 
possible (normally within two years), although 
Article 41 (5) and (6) BRRD allows the holding 
period to be extended.
Certain similarities exist between the asset sep-
aration tool and the bridge institution tool inas -
much as assets, rights or liabilities of an institu-
tion under resolution are transferred to a recipi -
ent controlled by the resolution authority. Un -
like the case of the bridge institution, the 
purpose of this recipient, designed as an “asset 
management vehicle”, is not to maintain crit -
ical functions but, on the contrary, to eventu -
ally sell assets or wind them down in an orderly 
fashion (Article 42 (3) BRRD). Activities deemed 
not worthy of being maintained can therefore be transferred to this asset management ve -
hicle (also known as a “bad bank”). These 
assets, too, shall be sold for an equitable price.
The possibility of writing down or converting 
capital instruments (Article 60 BRRD) is not a 
resolution tool in the narrow sense but is a fur -
ther option available to the resolution author -
ities under the BRRD and precedes a bail-  in.  
The first step is to write down common equity tier 1 (CET 1) capital in proportion to the losses, 
ie to reduce its principal amount. If this is not 
enough to achieve the resolution objectives, 
the next step is then to write down additional 
tier 1 (AT 1) capital instruments or to convert 
these to CET 1 capital. A further possible stage 
would be to convert tier 2 (T 2) capital into 
CET 1 capital or to write it down.8 Despite hav-
ing structural similarities to the bail-  in instru -
ment, which will be discussed below, these op-
tions are not resolution tools in the strict sense 
of the term since the liabilities concerned were 
issued as subordinate, loss-  absorbing instru -
ments from the outset.
The above-  m entioned tools were all used in 
similar forms during the crisis; they therefore have their functional equivalents in, for in -
stance, current German law (sections 48a et 
seq of the German Banking Act for the transfer 
order, section 5 of the Restructuring Fund Act 
(Restrukturierungsfondsgesetz)  for setting up 
bridge institutions, section 8a of the Financial 
Market Stabilisation Fund Act (Finanzmarkt -
stabilisierungsfondsgesetz)  for the establish -
ment of resolution agencies for risk exposures 
acquired before 30 September 2012). By con -
trast, the bail-  in, which is supposed to al low 
investors to be made to bear losses directly and is thus at the centre of the BRRD’s objective of 
presenting an alternative to the current bail-  out Bridge institution

8 CET 1, AT 1 and T 2 denote different classes of capital 
instruments, distinguishable in terms of quality and, follow-ing from that, their treatment by supervisors. Shares issued 
by a public limited company are an example of CET 1 in -
struments. AT 1 instruments include indefinite debt secur -
ities with no fixed payment or redemption incentives, 
whereas subordinate loans with an original maturity of at 
least five years count as T 2 instruments.Deutsche Bundesbank

regime, is a completely new concept from a 
legal standpoint and is thus the resolution tool 
being debated most heatedly by policymakers. 
It is similar to the write-  down or conversion of 
capital instruments already introduced earlier, with one exception: in principle, it encom -
passes all of an institution’s liabilities and not 
just instruments subject to an explicit subordin -
ation agreement.
The first step when applying the bail-  in tool is 
to assess the total amount of funds necessary 
to absorb the cumulated losses and thus return 
the net asset value of the institution under 
resolution to zero. The established aggregate 
amount can also be higher in order to restore a 
CET 1 ratio greater than zero within the mean-ing of the CRR as well as to absorb cumulated losses (Article 46 BRRD).
After the assessment, the aggregate amount to 
be raised, including the amount to be raised by 
writing down or converting capital instruments 
pursuant to Articles 59 and 60 BRRD, will be 
allocated to shareholders and creditors in ac -
cordance with a sequence, or liability cascade 
(Article 48 BRRD; see chart on page 40). The first 
instruments to be written down will be CET 1 
instruments, in accordance with Article 60 (1) 
letter a BRRD. Should this not suffice to raise 
the target amount, AT 1 instruments will then 
be written down, followed by T 2 instruments. 
Unlike under Article  60 BRRD, however, the 
hierarchy does not end once regulatory capital 
instruments have been exhausted. Instead, in a 
further stage, other subordinated liabilities can 
be written down as appropriate in a manner 
which respects the statutory ranking of claims 
under normal insolvency proceedings. Last but 
not least, all other creditors can be called to 
task, including preferred creditors, though the 
ranking of claims set forth in Article 108 BRRD 
must be complied with, as would be the case 
under normal insolvency proceedings: deposits 
held by natural persons or by micro, small and 
medium-  sized enterprises (SMEs) –  also known 
as “eligible deposits”  – that would normally 
benefit from deposit protection but are in  excess of the deposit guarantee threshold of 
€100,000 per institution and depositor outrank the claims of other creditors. Covered deposits and deposit guarantee schemes subrogating to 
the rights and obligations of covered deposit -
ors have the highest ranking. Even in a bail-  in  
scenario, creditors can be involved both by writing down capital instruments, ie reducing 
their principal, or by converting capital instru -
ments into CET 1 instruments. Shares in CET 1 instruments can be written down or diluted in 
order to involve their investors in losses; this 
 dilution comes about through the conversion 
of other instruments into CET 1, thereby redu -
cing the original investors’ percentage share in the institution. The condition for this approach, 
which forgoes the write-  down of CET  1 instru -
ments, is, however, that the institution still has 
a positive net value9 despite the cumulated 
losses (Article  47  (1) BRRD). This provision is 
motivated by the idea that the institution’s 
 remaining positive value belongs to existing 
shareholders and that writing down the shares would therefore be inappropriate.
The special provisions for treating deposits per -
petuate the guiding principle of depositor pro-
tection, elevated to one of multiple resolution 
objectives in Article 31 (2) BRRD. To this end, 
deposits protected under statutory deposit 
guarantee schemes (which have been harmon -
ised throughout Europe) are exempted from 
the bail-  in  tool up to a statutory limit of cur -
rently €100,000 per institution and depositor; 
the deposit is neither reduced nor converted 
and remains as a claim of the depositor on the 
institution (or a bridge institution). However, 
the deposit guarantee schemes responsible for 
the covered depositors are required to make a 
cash contribution in the amount by which 
covered deposits would have been written 
down had they not been exempted from the 
bail- in (Article  109 BRRD); this is an indirect 
method of bearing the costs. The rationale for 
this provision is that it allows deposit guarantee Calculating the

schemes to be made to bear the same percent -
age of the costs of resolution that they would 
have had to bear had depositors been compen -
sated following insolvency proceedings in place of resolution. In order to calculate the deposit 
guarantee scheme’s contribution to the costs, 
the scheme is located at the end of the “liability cascade”, ie given the most preferential status.
The wording of the directive sets forth add -
itional exemptions from the principle that all 
 liabilities should be covered by the write down 
and conversion powers and the bail-in; the most prominent provision is the exception 
given to interbank  liabilities with an original  maturity of less than seven days. The apparent rationale behind this arrangement is to be easy 
on the interbank money market, which is im -
portant for the monetary policy transmission process; however, it sets incentives towards 
short-  term, and thus less stable, bank funding 
and should therefore not be accepted entirely 
uncritically.
Alongside these legal exclusions, the resolution 
authority is also empowered, at its discretion 
and within the scope provided by Article 44 (3) 
BRRD, to exclude certain liabilities in whole or 
in part from bail-  in, thus modifying the hier -

share of the burden accruing to the exempted 
creditors, can either be distributed across other 
creditors, whose burden increases accordingly 
(Article 44 (3) BRRD, at the end) or covered by 
the resolution financing arrangement (Art -
icle 44 (4) BRRD). However, the precondition 
for the latter option, which is tantamount to 
offsetting losses within the banking sector, is that costs amounting to at least 8% of total 
 liabilities have been covered by shareholders 
and, as appropriate, creditors. In addition, the 
contribution of the resolution financing arrange -
ment is capped at 5% of total liabilities. In 
 exceptional cases, Article 44 (8) BRRD allows 
exemptions from these limits under certain 
conditions.
In order to assure sufficient funding for a bail-  in 
procedure, Article 45 BRRD sets out a minimum 
requirement for own funds and eligible liabil -
ities (MREL). European legislators have there -
fore put into practice a scheme being pro -
moted globally with maximum priority by the 
FSB – in keeping with a mandate by the 
St. Peters  bur g G20 summit to develop a pro -
posal for “gone-  concern loss-  absorbing cap -
acity” (GLAC). The European and global ap -
proaches share the idea that the ability to put 
the previously agreed resolution plan into oper -
ation, and thus give credibility to the entire 
resolution process, is predicated on ensuring 
adequate loss-  absorbing capacity at the time of 
resolution. Whereas the European MREL re -
gime applies to all institutions covered by the 
BRRD and gives the supervisory authorities dis-
cretionary scope, the global GLAC requirement 
is to apply only to global systemically important 
banks (G-  SIBs) and is to be defined as an inter -
nationally binding minimum standard.
The MREL is the quotient of own funds and 
 eligible liabilities divided by the institution’s 
total liabilities and own funds, with derivative 
liabilities included in the denominator on a net 
basis. The minimum requirement (in per cent) is 
set individually for each institution by the reso -
lution authority; the liability must have a re-sidual maturity of at least one year to count towards meeting the requirement. The calcula -
tion of the MREL is based on the institution’s total liabilities since a majority of EU member 
states did not think that basing it on risk-  
weighted assets (RWA) was useful as they 
 potentially lack meaningfulness in crisis situ -
ations. Although calculating the ratio on the 
basis of unweighted balance sheet values in a 
non- risk-  adjusted manner involves the danger  
that high-  risk and thus high-  mar gin, small-  
volume business activity will be preferred over 
low- risk, low-  mar gin and thus high-  volume  
transactions, it avoids the drawbacks that emerged in the past when the calculations 
were based on risk-  weighted r atios caused by 
inadequate risk weighting (resulting, for in -
stance, from using internal models or zero-  
weighting certain assets such as government 
bonds). The GLAC requirements for G-  SIBs,  
which are being debated globally, could, how -
ever, lead to changes in the calculation basis, at 
least for European G-  SIBs, as the global calcula -
tion basis is still being negotiated.
The MREL ratio is competing, in a sense, with 
the CRR own funds ratios since, to a bank, 
both are binding ratios which have to be com -
plied with at all times; on balance, it is the 
stricter regime, in each individual case, which 
informs the bank’s business practices.
Resolution financing
The starting point for the BRRD is the afore -
mentioned guiding principle that the share -
holders and creditors of the institution – in that order – should be the parties to bear the losses. 
However, it cannot be ruled out that, in individ -
ual cases, external sources of funding might 
need to be tapped in a resolution event. In 
order not to make taxpayers as a whole liable 
for the resulting costs, the BRRD requires mem -
ber states to establish resolution financing 
 arrangements, generally in the form of a reso -
lution fund.Minimum re-

These funds are generally financed through ex 
ante contributions. Pursuant to Article  103 
BRRD, all institutions authorised in the territory 
of the EU member states are required to make 
contributions, as are branches of third-  country 
institutions located in the EU (Article  2 (89) 
BRRD). The contributions are calculated based 
on the amount of liabilities (excluding own funds) of the contributing party less covered 
deposits, as contributions to the deposit guar -
antee schemes have already been made for these liabilities. This calculation base is then 
divided by the aggregate of all contributing 
parties in the respective member state and ad -
justed for the institution’s risk profile. The 
 actual contribution amount is to be calculated 
such that each member state reaches the tar -
get level10 of 1% of covered deposits in its ter -
ritory by the end of 2024 (Article 102 BRRD). 
The Commission will be empowered to enact a 
delegated legal act fleshing out the details of 
these BRRD provisions.
According to current estimates, for Germany 
this would result in a total of currently around €2 trillion in covered deposits and thus require 
annual contributions of around €2 billion over 
a ten-  ye ar period. This represents a distinct 
 increase over the current national bank levy, 
which raised a total of around €520 million in 
2013.11 Since the SRM Regulation shortens the 
period for building up the envisaged fund from 
ten to eight years (for more see page 50), the 
annual burden could be even higher.
If the amount raised through ex ante contribu-
tions is not sufficient to cover the fund’s ex -
penditure, ex post contributions can be raised. 
Their size is capped at three regular ex ante  
 annual contributions. In those cases where 
the requirement to pay ex post contributions 
could endanger the solvency or liquidity of a 
contribution-  pay ing institution, the BRRD per -
mits an institution to defer its payments.
Article 105 BRRD permits, as a last resort, the 
use of alternative funding means in the form of 
borrowings or other forms of support. Institu -tions and financial institutions are named as 
 examples of contractual parties for providing 
such support, but the BRRD explicitly also men -
tions the option of “other third parties”. Loans 
taken out on this basis are to be repaid from 
future contributions to the fund. At all events, 
central banks are out of the question as third-  
party lenders, since resolution is a public task and lending to a resolution fund by a central 
bank would ultimately violate the ban on mon-
etary financing of governments (Article  123 
TFEU).
Article 101 BRRD lists the purposes for which 
the resolution financing arrangements may be 
used; these include guaranteeing or purchasing 
the assets or the liabilities of the institution, a 
bridge institution or an asset management 
 vehicle, and making contributions to a bridge 
institution or an asset management vehicle. 
Moreover, in cases where certain creditor 
classes are excluded from bail-  in, the r esolution 
financing arrangements may be used where private investors have already contributed an 
amount equivalent to at least 8% of total liabil-
ities. Moreover, the resolution fund may also 
be used to pay compensation to a shareholder 
or creditor in a resolution procedure if the 
losses incurred are greater than would have 
been incurred in hypothetical insolvency pro -
ceedings.
Article 100 (2) BRRD allows member states to 
use the same administrative structure for the 
resolution financing arrangement as for the 
 deposit guarantee scheme. The financial means 
raised through these two structures have to be 
administered separately, however, and may 
only be used for the respective purposes.
Article 100 (6) BRRD, by contrast, gives cause 
for concern. It gives member states the option

 arrangement as a dedicated fund. Instead, in -
stitutions’ contributions would flow directly 
into the central government budget; if neces -
sary the member state is then required to make 
available immediately to its resolution author -
ity, upon the latter’s request, an amount equal 
to these contributions (a “fiscal solution”).
The apparent purpose of this provision is to 
save member states already operating such a 
scheme the need to change their procedure. However, this type of resolution financing ar -
rangement is not without its risks to the aims 
pursued by the BRRD. There is reason to fear 
that political pressures could lead to the finan -
cial means from banks’ contributions, once they are available to central government 
budgets, being appropriated for non-  r esolution 
purposes instead of being set aside for later use 
in resolution. However, it is precisely in times of 
crisis, which require the use of resolution tools, 
that the distressed member state might not be 
able to issue bonds in the markets at accept -
able terms and conditions. The result would be 
to counteract one of the basic tenets of the 
resolution regime: to loosen the “doom loop” 
between government finances and banks’ bal-ance sheets.
Cross-  border procedures
Pursuant to the BRRD, national resolution au -
thorities are basically responsible for the appli -
cation of the envisaged tools. Dealing with 
banking groups which operate across national 
borders puts this approach, which is focused 
on individual member states, to the test. To 
solve the problem, the BRRD requires extensive 
cooperation and coordination between na -
tional resolution authorities. To this end, reso -
lution colleges will be established (Articles 88 
and 89 BRRD). This will be the framework for 
taking joint decisions on a group resolution plan, for instance. If no consensus on a joint 
decision can be reached, the group-  level r eso-
lution authority, which usually means the reso -
lution authority in the parent company’s home country, decides on the group resolution plan 
(Article 13 (5) BRRD). Similar provisions apply to 
the assessment of the group recovery plan by 
the responsible national supervisory authority.
If, indeed, a cross-  bor der group is to be re -
solved, the BRRD calls on the national reso -
lution authorities involved to reach a joint deci-
sion on the group resolution scheme in which 
the resolution actions to be taken for the indi -
vidual group members are laid out and the 
costs are allocated to the national resolution 
funds involved. If no consensus can be reached, 
each national authority may take independent 
resolution actions or measures for the group members domiciled in its jurisdiction (Art -
icle 92 (4) BRRD). In such a case, a “multiple-  
point-  of-  entry” approach will ultimately be 
chosen: resolution measures will be imposed 
separately on each legally independent entity, 
as opposed to the approach of applying instru -
ments only at the level of the parent entity for 
the entire group (“single-  point-  of-  entry” ap -
proach).
National implementation 
in Germany
As an EU directive, the BRRD needs to be im -
plemented by means of a national implement-
ing act. The German Federal Ministries of 
 Finance and Justice are therefore developing 
draft legislation to implement the BRRD.
This implementation act is being drafted as an 
omnibus act. An Act on the Recovery and Reso -
lution of Institutions and Financial Groups ( Ge-
setz zur Sanierung und Abwicklung von Institu -
ten und Finanzgruppen,  Recovery and Reso-
lution Act) is being introduced; at the same time, the legislation will make the necessary 
amendments to existing acts, such as the Ger -
man Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) and the 
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act (Gesetz 
zur Reorganisation von Kreditinstituten),  intro -
duced by the Restructuring Act (Restrukturie -
rungsgesetz).  The new statute is designed to “Fiscal solution”

cover measures to prepare and conduct recov -
ery and resolution actions, which is why the 
existing recovery and resolution provisions of 
the Banking Act will be rescinded. With respect to the new act’s general scope of application, it 
currently looks as though it will be synchron -
ised with the BRRD’s provisions: this means that the scope will be narrower than that of 
the Banking Act.
The provisions of the new regime will, in fu -
ture, apply not just to those institutions re -
garded as potentially posing a systemic risk; 
instead, once the national implementation act 
has entered into force, all institutions covered 
by the Recovery and Resolution Act will have to create recovery plans. In individual cases, how -
ever, institutions will be able to apply for ex -
emptions, or simplified requirements for creat -
ing recovery plans may be applicable.
The implementation of the BRRD will require 
the creation of a national resolution authority. 
In order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, 
it needs to be separate from entities respon -
sible for banking supervision. No decision on 
the specific allocation of responsibilities has 
been taken yet. By contrast, it is the task of off-  
site supervisors to review the recovery plans which means that – in line with general prin -
ciples (see section 7 of the Banking Act and the 
Prudential Supervisory Guideline (Aufsichts -
richtlinie) ) – involving the Bundesbank would 
be appropriate.
Under the BRRD, the national implementing 
statute is to become law by 1 January 2015 at 
the latest. The deadline for implementing the 
bail- in tool is 1  January 2016 according to the 
BRRD. Germany is seeking to introduce the 
bail- in tool ahead of schedule, at the same  
time as the other instruments, with effect from 
1 January 2015.12Overall assessment of the 
BRRD
The underlying aim of the BRRD, to avoid so -
cialising the risks of banking business and the 
attendant losses when they materialise, merits 
support; it allows a restoration of the market 
economy principle that investors themselves should bear responsibility for the risks arising 
from their investment decisions, and thereby 
reduces moral hazard.
However, this fundamental approach is riddled 
with statutory or discretionary exceptions. 
Chief among these is the discretion to exclude 
certain creditors from bail-  in. The option of  
using the resolution fund for indirect loss ab -
sorption or the possibility of using, in excep -
tional cases, public funds as part of govern -
ment stabilisation mechanisms to bail institu -
tions out also further constrain creditor liability. 
However, socialising losses within the banking 
industry through the resolution fund is still 
preferable to fiscal bail-  outs, the bill for which 
would be footed by taxpayers at large.To be sure, a certain degree of flexibility is ne -
cessary to make the resolution regime tractable 
in practice; in the absence of any options for 
exceptions, the complexity and interconnect -
edness of individual instruments might make the application of the regime dangerous in 
terms of financial stability, which could render 
a resolution procedure unviable as a third 
 option alongside insolvency or bail-  out. How -
ever, it must be assured that the application of 
such exclusions is in fact limited to extreme 
 exceptional cases and does not de facto  be-
come the rule.Recovery plan

12 In order to provide added incentive for member states 
to implement the provisions in the BRRD governing the 
bail- in of cr editors at an early stage, a broad majority of 
Eurogroup finance ministers agreed that the ESM should 
provide direct recapitalisation to banks only if indirect 
 recapitalisation through the home country is not possible 
and shareholders and creditors have been bailed in to the 
tune of at least 8% of the bank’s total liabilities. See re -

Extending the scope of the BRRD to cover small 
institutions will be problematic. It initially does not seem appropriate to include such banks in 
the BRRD’s scope of application and to make them contribute to the funding of a system from which they themselves will most likely 
not  benefit since their current size means 
that they do not pose a danger to financial sta -
bility. However, small institutions, too, benefit 
from the overall financial market stabilisation 
afforded by the existence of an effective reso -
lution regime. Specific experience of the finan -
cial crisis abroad has also shown that numerous 
small interconnected institutions (“too many to 
fail”) can, through forced mergers, become a 
systemically important institution. Against this 
background, fund contributions, particularly those which are fraught with controversy, 
should not be seen in economic terms as a sort 
of insurance premium to cover the potential 
default of the contribution-  paying institution  
but more as a type of financial stability levy.
A criticism occasionally levelled at the new 
resolution regime, yet without any traction, is 
that it will cause credit institutions’ funding 
costs to rise, therefore leading ultimately either to a deterioration of profitability or higher lend-
ing rates, which would weigh on the real econ -
omy. There are various indications
13 that espe-
cially institutions regarded as being too big to 
fail still enjoy an implicit government guarantee 
under the current regime: investors anticipate 
that a distressed institution will be rescued with public funds and therefore offer the institution 
funding at more favourable rates than if the 
risks were completely internalised. An increase in banks’ funding costs owing to the existence 
of a credible resolution regime is, in such cases, 
not an adverse side-  effect but quite the oppos -
ite: a sign that the actual risks have been priced 
properly, and thus an effective instrument to 
 reduce moral hazard.Single Resolution 
 Mechanism – SRM
General principles
Although the BRRD harmonises substantive 
resolution law and related regulations, such as those on restructuring and resolution planning, 
it leaves institutional responsibility at the na -
tional level. In terms of subject matter, the scope of the SRM Regulation extends further 
than that of the BRRD: it creates a uniform in-
stitutional framework for decision-  m aking on 
how to apply the tools harmonised under the 
BRRD. However, the SRM Regulation has a nar -
rower geographical scope than the BRRD, as it 
applies solely to banks that are subject to the 
SSM Regulation and thus, de facto, only to the 
EU countries participating in the SSM,14 ie the 
euro-  ar ea countries and any non-  eur o-  ar ea EU 
countries which have opted into the SSM by 
entering into close cooperation with the ECB.
The SSM and SRM are both key building blocks 
in the overall banking union project; monetary union will now be followed by the introduction 
of European-  level r esponsibility for related 
areas such as banking supervision and bank resolution. In addition, the supervisory and resolution regimes will complement one an -
other. Much like private investors, regulatory bodies should be bound by the principle that 
the level responsible for ensuring that bank bal -
ance sheets are sound should also bear the consequences of any harm caused if they are 
not; otherwise, there is little incentive for sus -
tainable behaviour. Consequently, the SSM pro -
ject to raise banking supervision to the Euro -
pean level, which is already under way, now 
needs to be followed by a European resolution Financial market

mechanism; responsibility for these two key 
building blocks in the banking union must not 
remain at two different levels in the long run. 
This principle is described as “aligning liability 
and control”.
The SRM project faces two difficulties, how -
ever. From a legal point of view, the fact that 
the existing EU treaties were not drawn up 
with a banking union in mind is problematic. 
As a result, the treaties do not provide the 
 necessary legal foundations for creating an in -
dependent European resolution authority with 
extensive decision-  making powers. The curr ent 
approach to the SRM project is adapted to the 
constraints of existing primary EU law, and should therefore be viewed in this light (see box on pages  48 to 49). The fact remains, 
however, that a European resolution authority 
can only be given limited decision-  making  
powers.
In addition, there is a potential economic obs -
tacle to immediate and full mutualisation of 
bank resolution. For the euro-  ar ea countries at 
least, the SSM will largely raise banking super -
vision to the European level. Yet other areas 
such as fiscal, economic or taxation policy will 
remain under national responsibility, and these 
can also have substantial and lasting effects, at 
least indirectly, on the stability of the banking 
sector.15 A gradual mutualisation of liability is 
therefore in line with the responsibility of mem -
ber states for past imbalances.
Decision-  making processes
The Single Resolution Board (SRB), which is to 
be established as an EU agency with legal per -
sonality, will be at the heart of the SRM’s insti-
tutional framework. The SRB will take decisions regarding the resolution of all banks subject to 
direct ECB supervision and regarding other 
banks with subsidiaries in other participating 
member states, as well as in cases where mem-
ber states have transferred responsibility to the 
European level. In the above instances, the SRB will adopt a resolution scheme which stipulates 
the measures to be taken and must be imple -
mented by the national resolution authorities (Article  16  (5) SRM Regulation). In all other 
cases, responsibility for resolution will  r emain 
with the national resolution authorities. How -
ever, the national resolution authorities will 
only be able to adopt measures which do not 
require any use of the Single Resolution Fund 
(SRF), as recourse to SRF resources will also 
only be permitted on the basis of an SRB reso -
lution scheme (Article 6a (3) SRM Regulation).
SRB meetings can be convened in either the ex -
ecutive or the plenary session. In its executive 
session, the SRB will be composed of a chair16 
and four other full-  time members. The SRB’ s 
plenary session will additionally include repre -
sentatives of the national resolution author -
ities. This will enable the SRB to draw on na -
tional expertise to complement the European 
perspective. In both sessions, the European 
Commission and the ECB will merely participate 
as observers, not members. This is to avoid 
possible conflicts of interest with other tasks in 
their respective roles as the EU’s competition 
watchdog and the European banking supervis -
ory authority. The “European” members of the 
SRB, ie its chair, vice-  chair and the four other 
full- time members, ar e to be chosen on the 
basis of an open selection procedure. They will 
be appointed for a five-  year term of office by  
the Council of the European Union (the Coun -
cil), based on a proposal submitted by the 
European Commission and approved by the 
European Parliament (Article 52 SRM Regula -
tion). The national resolution authorities will 
appoint their own representatives.Lack of legal

15 One example would be regulations on the tax deduct -
ibility of interest on building loans, which can encourage 
the formation of property bubbles.16 In addition, the draft SRM Regulation makes reference 
to a vice-  chair on sever al occasions. According to Art -
icle 52, the vice-  chair wil l also be appointed at the Euro -
pean level. However, the office of vice-  chair is not men -
tioned in the articles governing the SRB’s composition, 
which implies that, unless the chair is absent, the vice-  chair 
will not have his or her own position with voting rights on the SRB. The recitals do not provide absolute clarity on this 
matter either.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
June 2014

The SRB’s executive session, which will be 
geared towards practical needs, will be the key 
forum for addressing specific resolution cases. 
Alongside the chair and the full-  time members 
of the SRB, only the member states in which 
the institution operates will participate; add -
itional observers may be invited on an ad hoc 
basis. The composition of the executive session is thus geared towards practical needs and pri -
marily involves only those member states which are directly affected.
The SRB’s tasks will include drawing up reso -
lution plans, assessing the resolvability of spe-
cific banks and preparing concrete resolution 
 decisions. To enable the SRB to carry out its 
tasks, it will be given far-  r eaching investigatory 
powers. For instance, it will not only be allowed to access all information available to the ECB or 
to the national supervisory authorities, it will 
also be entitled to conduct all necessary inves -
tigations and on-  site inspections  either dir ectly 
or through the national authorities. In addition, 
the SRB will have far-  r eaching powers to re -
move impediments to an institution’s resolv-
ability. For example, it will be  entitled to require 
the entity to divest specific assets or change its legal or operational structures, or those of any 
group entity under its control, so as to reduce 
complexity and ensure that critical functions 
may be separated from other functions through the application of the resolution tools.
Ahead of a bank resolution, it is envisaged that 
the initial assessment of whether the institution 
can be deemed failing or likely to fail will gen -
erally come from the ECB. To avoid supervisory 
failures and omissions, however, the executive 
session of the SRB will also be entitled to deter -
mine that an entity is failing or likely to fail if 
the ECB does not take a decision within three 
days of the SRB informing the ECB of its inten -
tion to reach this assessment. By contrast, the 
SRB itself must always judge whether the other 
criteria for a resolution are met (resolution is in 
the public interest, no alternative private sector 
measures would prevent the entity’s failure).If the decision is taken to resolve an entity, the 
SRB will develop a resolution scheme. How -
ever, the Meroni doctrine (see box on pages 48 
to 49) dictates that only EU institutions en -
shrined in primary EU law have the power to 
take decisions implying a wide margin of dis -
cretion. The strategy set out in the SRM Regu -
lation (Article 16 (6)) for involving the Commis-sion and the Council – as institutions enshrined 
in primary EU law – therefore envisages that 
the resolution scheme will only enter into force 
if neither of these institutions has raised any 
objections to it within 24 hours. Should either 
 institution raise an objection, the SRB will be 
obliged to modify the resolution scheme within eight hours.
The Commission will be entitled to base its ob -
jections on discretionary aspects of the reso -
lution scheme put forward by the SRB. By con -
trast, the Council will only be permitted to act 
on a proposal from the Commission and not on 
its own initiative. The Council will be able to 
object to an SRB decision if it does not fulfil the 
public interest criterion, and it will be entitled 
to approve or object to the Commission’s 
modification proposal when there is a material modification (of 5% or more) to the amount of 
the Fund to be used compared with the SRB’s 
original proposal. In both cases, the Council 
will act by simple majority.
The Commission’s approval will also be re -
quired in cases where resolution action would 
involve state aid within the meaning of EU law 
(Article 107 of the TFEU) or SRF aid. As there is 
a danger of competition being distorted in 
such situations, the Commission, in its role as 
competition watchdog, must approve the use 
of funds in these instances (Article  16a SRM 
Regulation).
The SRB’s plenary session will be responsible 
for general policy issues (eg annual work pro -
gramme, budget, investment decisions). In 
addition, the plenary session will take decisions on individual resolutions in cases where use of 
the SRF reaches the €5 billion threshold or Decisions on

Limitations on the functioning of the 
Single Resolution Board (SRB) imposed by primary law
In the run- up to the creation of the Single 
Resolution Board (SRB), it is even more 
questionable now than when the European 
supervisory authorities (on which less exten-
sive decision- making powers have been conferred) were established whether the envisaged sweeping transfer of powers to this body is legal under the chosen legal basis. Essentially at issue is the scope for discretion that can be given to EU bodies 
and agencies, which – like the SRB – are not provided for by the European treaties if sov-
ereign decision- making powers are con-ferred on the basis of Article 114 TFEU. 
 According to a 1958 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), an EU institution may only establish an EU agency 
and may only delegate decision- making 
powers within that agency’s mandate if the scope of the agency’s powers is clearly de-
fi  ned, limiting the institution’s margin for discretion from the start. The purpose of 
this is to prevent the agency from overstep-
ping its mandate while ensuring oversight 
by the delegating body and the amenability 
of the agency’s decisions to judicial review 
(the “Meroni judgement”).1
Just recently, the CJEU issued a detailed 
judgement on the delegation of powers to 
EU agencies in a case involving the Euro-pean Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA).2 With regard to the limitations on 
the decision- making powers to be conferred 
on the EU agency, the CJEU expressly re-
ferred to, in particular, the scope for discre-tion laid down by the EU legislature regard-
ing the harmonisation measures pursuant 
to Article 114 TFEU. The CJEU held that the Union’s legislature is authorised to establish 
EU agencies if the legislature deems the 
 establishment of such an agency necessary 
for objective reasons. In particular, this is likely to be the case if the measures to be 
taken require special professional and tech-
nical expertise and a corresponding ability 
to respond swiftly and appropriately. How-
ever, due to the aforementioned reasons, the CJEU also required that the conferred powers be subject to specifi  c criteria and limitations. Overall, the CJEU clearly speci-
fi  ed this requirement in its decision on the 
ESMA by ruling that the tightness of the 
limits in each case also refl  ect the objectives established for that particular EU agency.
In an opinion published in October 2013, 
the Council’s Legal Service was critical of an 
earlier draft of the SRM Regulation for, in 
some cases, providing the SRB with exces-
sive discretionary powers (eg regarding the 
creation of a resolution plan or the use of 
resolution funds) which were no longer 
consistent with the Meroni doctrine. It held 
that either the criticised powers had to be 
so clearly defi  ned that the SRB would not 
be able to exercise wide discretion, or the 
powers affected would be taken on by EU 
institutions (already provided for in the 
treaties of the European Union) with execu-tive authority.
The current version of the draft regulation 
still envisages discretionary decision- making powers for the SRB, which merit criticism in 
the light of the Meroni doctrine. Despite a 
number of amendments made during the 
legislative process, the SRB’s competencies 
remain broad. Against the backdrop of the 
CJEU’s ruling on ESMA powers, one could 
therefore critically examine whether the 
CJEU’s fi  ndings have been suffi   ciently re-
fl  ected. Although the Commission and the

where at least €10 billion in liquidity support 
would be granted. The executive session will take decisions regarding cases below these 
thresholds. The plenary session will take its de -
cisions by a simple majority of its members; 
each member will have one vote. In the event 
of a tie, the chair will have the casting vote. The SRB will take decisions regarding SRF re -
sources and their mutualisation by a simple 
majority of its members. Should external fund -
ing be needed in addition to the financial 
means available in the SRF, a majority of two-  
thirds of the board members, representing at least 30% of contributions (in the first eight 
years: at least 50%) will be required.
The executive session will take decisions re-
garding the resolution of a bank by consensus. If the members of the executive session are un -
able to reach a consensus within a set dead -
line, the chair and the four full-  time members  
will take a decision by a simple majority. This will substantially reduce the influence of na -tional representatives on the resolution schemes. A resolution scheme passed by the executive session which requires the approval of the plenary session will be deemed to be 
adopted unless, within three hours of the draft 
being submitted, at least one member of the 
plenary session has requested a meeting of the 
plenary session. The plenary session will then 
take a decision on the resolution scheme.
While these multi-  layer ed procedures (see chart 
on page 50) are intended to address the legal 
concerns (with regard to primary EU law) out -
lined above, they also make the decision-  
making process more complex and therefore 
affect its effectiveness and credibility. They are 
a compromise between the national govern -
ments’ desire to be involved through the Coun-cil and the wish expressed in some quarters of 
the European Parliament to incorporate the European Commission, as the EU’s executive 
body. Although these decision-  making pr o-
cesses are much simpler than in earlier versions Given complex-
ity of decision-
 
making 
pro-
cesses, change to primary law needed in 
 
medium to  
long termCouncil are involved in the decision- making 
process, the ability of such involvement to 
constrain the SRB’s scope in line with the 
Meroni doctrine is doubtful, for two rea-sons. First, both bodies have only limited powers to infl  uence the SRB’s resolution 
decisions since both their veto and amend-ing powers are limited to certain aspects (in 
the case of the Commission, these are dis-
cretionary aspects of the resolution pro-
gramme; the Council, in turn, acts on a pro-posal from the Commission if there is a lack of public interest or if considerable changes 
have been made to the use of fund re-sources). Second, doubts arise about 
whether the understandably tight deadline 
of a maximum of 24 hours to ensure the 
ability to act is suffi   cient for the Council and 
the Commission to adequately assess the aspects under their control. Ultimately, these Council and Commission control mechanisms can do little to limit the  decision- making scope granted to the SRB. 
Owing to the severity of impact the reso-
lution measures will have, a judicial review 
of the legality of conferring decision- making 
powers on the SRB cannot be ruled out. With regard to legal certainty, it would therefore be desirable for the SRB and its powers to be anchored in the treaties of 
the European Union.Deutsche Bundesbank

of the draft SRM Regulation, the question 
 remains as to how well these complex systems 
will work in practice. The structures set out in 
the regulation remain cumbersome and have 
certain drawbacks in terms of efficiency. The continuing aim should therefore be a change 
to primary law which creates the legal ground -
ing for a genuine European resolution authority 
with efficient autonomous decision-  making  
powers. The objective should be to ensure that 
a bank can be resolved over the course of a 
weekend (ie between when the markets close 
in the United States on Friday evening and 
when they open in Asia on Monday morning). It remains to be seen whether this is feasible 
under the conditions outlined above.
Resolution financing
Besides the SRB and the associated decision-  
making processes, the second key element 
introduced by the SRM Regulation is a Single 
Bank Resolution Fund, or SRF. The SRF will be 
administered by the SRB and will replace 
 national resolution financing arrangements 
within the meaning of the BRRD (Article  85 
SRM Regulation) for the SRM member coun -
tries. As in the BRRD, the target funding level 
for the SRF is 1% of the amount of covered 
deposits of all credit institutions authorised in 
the participating member states (currently around €55 billion), which is to be built up 
within eight years. All institutions established in the SRM countries will be obliged to pay contri-butions irrespective of whether they are under 
the direct supervision of the ECB or of a  national 
authority within the SSM.
Some member states have already passed au -
tonomous legislation, ie national legislation not based on European provisions, to create mech -
anisms with a similar function and structure to 
the resolution funding arrangements estab -
lished in the BRRD and the SRM Regulation. Germany is one of these countries, having launched its Restructuring Fund – which is fi -
nanced via a bank levy – on 1 January 2011. 
The Restructuring Fund can be used to set up 
bridge entities, acquire business units in the ab-
sorbing legal entities, issue guarantees, carry out recapitalisations or fulfil claims arising in 
connection with such a measure.17 Its resources 
totalled around €1.8 billion at the end of 2013.

ment of the participating member states within 
the meaning of the BRRD (Article  85 SRM 
Regulation). The legality of using these  financial 
resources for a different purpose to that for 
which they were collected would be question -
able. Moreover, simply transferring these funds 
to the SRF without due consideration would be 
inappropriate, as this would  effectively put the 
banking sectors of the member states which 
have already introduced this kind of system at 
the national level at a disadvantage to the 
banking industries of the other participating 
countries. It is essential to avoid imposing 
double payments on institutions which have al -
ready paid into national funds and would now 
also have to contribute to the SRF. Article 66 
(2b) of the SRM Regulation therefore permits 
the national resolution financing arrangements 
to use their available financial means to com -
pensate institutions for the new contributions 
that they may be required to pay into the SRF. The existing national resources will thus be de -
pleted gradually until they have, in effect, been 
transferred to the SRF without imposing double 
payments on contribution payers.
Certain differences between the BRRD and the 
SRM Regulation mean that national funds will 
remain in place for one segment, which is un-
likely to account for a very large volume: the 
SRM will only apply to investment firms if their 
parent undertakings are subject to consoli -
dated supervision carried out by the ECB within 
the meaning of the SSM Regulation. Conse -
quently, small investment firms which do not 
belong to a significant group will remain out -
side the scope of the SRM and the SRF. In 
 accordance with Article  2 (23) of the BRRD, 
however, they are also covered by the member 
states’ obligation to set up a resolution finan -
cing arrangement.In effect, the SRF will lead to a mutualisation of 
liability for bank failures. To broadly synchron -
ise the progression to shared European liability 
with the move to shared European control, the 
approach set out in the legislation envisages a 
gradual transition to resolution financing at the European level. Yet this is only a rudimentary 
means of aligning liability and control. During 
an eight-  year tr ansitional period, the SRF will 
be divided into national compartments, which 
will receive the contributions paid by banks in 
their respective countries. The details of this 
mutualisation are not governed by the SRM 
Regulation itself, as the legality of entrusting 
the EU with such far-  r eaching powers to ad -
minister national funds via legislation passed 
under Article 114 of the TFEU is questionable. 
Instead, the participating member states (all 
the EU member states apart from the United 
Kingdom and Sweden) have signed an inter -
governmental agreement (IGA) alongside the SRM Regulation. Once ratified, this IGA will provide the legal foundations, in line with 
 national constitutional provisions, for mutualis -
ing SRF funds.
This gradual mutualisation will be implemented 
through a process of cost distribution between 
the national compartments, which will go 
through several stages. The starting point is the 
provision that, in cases where SRF funds are 
used, recourse should first be made to the 
compartments of the member states in which 
the bank or banking group under resolution is 
established or authorised. The costs are to be 
distributed between these compartments in 
proportion to the past contributions paid by 
the group to the respective compartments. 
However, this recourse to the home member 
states’ compartments must remain below cer -
tain thresholds. Recourse to 100% of the finan -
cial means in these compartments will be per -
mitted during the first year of the transitional 
period, with the threshold falling to 60% in the 
second year and 40% in the third, followed by 
a linear decline during the subsequent years. 
Once the applicable threshold has been 
reached, recourse to the compartments of all 
other participating member states – including 
those in which the group is neither established 
nor authorised  – will also be permitted in a second stage; this recourse must likewise 
 remain below a certain threshold. The thresh -

rise gradually. At the end of this process, after 
the eight-  year tr ansitional phase has elapsed, 
all the national compartments will cease to 
exist and liability will be fully mutualised at the 
European level. The various compartments will thus be merged into a single fund.
Several factors need to be considered when judging the speed of this mutualisation. First, 
the eight-  year pr ocess of transferring liability 
from the national to the European level is not 
linear; a significant reduction in national liability 
and a corresponding increase in European 
 liability is already envisaged from the second 
year onwards. Second, the specified percent -
ages do not relate to resolution costs but to the size of the respective national compart -
ments; the potential costs to the compartments 
of large member states are thus greater than 
the percentages might suggest, as the overall 
volume from which the threshold is calculated is larger. Third, the IGA provides for the possi -
bility of temporary transfers between the SRF’s 
national compartments during the transitional 
period, which could bring forward mutualisa-
tion. The SRB will take decisions on such tem -
porary transfers by a simple majority of its plen -
ary session. The member state from whose 
compartment the transfer is to be made will 
only be able to veto such decisions under cer -
tain circumstances. Although the IGA stipulates that the transfers must be refunded with inter -
est before the transitional period elapses, a 
higher level of mutualisation will be in place by then; the SRF’s division into compartments will 
be less relevant because of the increased liabil-
ity at the European level. In effect, such trans -
fers would make the mutualisation of the com-partments faster than specified in the IGA.
If the costs facing the SRF are not fully covered 
by the measures envisaged in the two initial 
stages outlined above, a third stage entailing 
unlimited recourse to the compartments of the 
home member states will be initiated. A fourth 
stage will allow extraordinary ex post contribu-
tions to be levied in line with the principles 
 described above, while a fifth stage will enable the SRB to borrow funds externally on the SRF’s 
behalf or to mandate the above-  m entioned 
temporary transfers between national compart -
ments. The reference to contracting funds via 
“public financial arrangements” in Article 69a 
of the SRM Regulation suggests that these pro -
visions were written with national budget 
funds or the tax-  funded Eur opean Stability 
Mechanism (ESM) in mind (see box on pages 53 
to 54). This is unproblematic as long as the SRM Regulation is not used to exert legal or practical coercion on the ESM to loan funds; 
lending  decisions must be taken by the ESM’ s 
decision-  making bodies in line with the applic -
able procedures.
Overall assessment
The creation of the SRM, as the second pillar of 
the banking union, through the SRM Regula -
tion and the IGA is essentially a welcome step: 
in the interests of aligning liability and control, 
the institutional progression to European bank -
ing supervision through the SSM project makes 
it necessary to transfer institutional responsibil -
ity for bank resolution to the European level 
too, rather than merely harmonising substan -
tive resolution law as is envisaged in the BRRD. 
Even so, the decision-  making pr ocesses set out 
in the SRM Regulation are complex and cum -
bersome, which ultimately undermines the 
credibility of the mechanism. Consequently, the 
member states should not take the forthcom -
ing completion of the SRM legislative project as 
an excuse to reduce the pace of the necessary 
institutional reforms. Instead, they should 
swiftly tackle the requisite treaty changes in 
order to lay the legal foundations for a more 
efficient SRM; the current solution can only be 
temporary given the shortcomings caused by 
the aforementioned constraints of primary EU 
law. When devising these treaty changes, 
thought should also be given to how to resolve 
any  r emaining tensions between the full mutu -
alisation of resolution financing which will then 
be in place and the impact of national policy spheres on the stability of banks. One option Mutualisation in

The envisaged role of public funds in European bank 
 resolution
One aim of the new bank resolution regime 
is to ensure wherever possible that public 
coffers, and thus ultimately the taxpayer, 
will not have to foot the bill for bank bail- 
outs again. However, it is not realistic to 
rule out all possibility of public sector sup-
port, especially in the event of a severe sys-temic crisis.
1 The Single Resolution Mechan-
ism (SRM) thus envisages that, after all 
components in the liability cascade (which 
is described on pages 39 to 41 and pages 50 
to 52) have been exhausted and alongside 
the possibility of granting temporary loans 
between the national compartments of the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), the SRF will be 
able to borrow funds from other sources, including the public sector. According to 
the Eurogroup’s statement of 18 December 
2013, during the transitional period these 
loans will initially be available from national 
sources and, if necessary, from the Euro-pean Stability Mechanism (ESM). A com-
mon backstop will be developed during the transitional period which will also allow the SRF recourse to public funds.
Irrespective of the concrete form that such 
a backstop takes, it is a welcome develop-
ment that the Bank Recovery and Reso-
lution Directive (BRRD) and the SRM envis-
age that bank resolutions should only in-
volve the use of a ﬁ  scal backstop as a last 
resort, thus protecting the taxpayer. Before 
the ﬁ  scal backstop is used, providers of 
equity and debt capital are to bear as much 
of the costs as possible – for instance by 
means of a bail- in – and, if necessary, the banking sector is to shoulder some of the 
burden via the SRF. However, exceptions to 
this rule could mean that, in practice, tax 
funds are used to support banks at an earl-
ier juncture. For instance, certain creditors 
may be exempted from a bail- in under spe-
ciﬁ  c conditions (see pages  39 to 40). In addition, precautionary recapitalisation 
using public funds could also breach the no bail- out principle. The BRRD provides scope 
for precautionary recapitalisation by enab-
ling solvent institutions to receive state aid 
under certain conditions without this auto-matically triggering a resolution procedure, 
meaning that providers of equity and debt 
capital might shoulder little or none of the burden.
2
The introduction of the SRM as a second 
building block in the banking union along-
side the Single Supervisory Mechanism 
(SSM) is a logical step, as it will ensure that 
liability and control are adequately aligned 
with one another within the sphere of banking supervision. However, a common backstop within the banking union could 
create undesirable incentives which discour-age sound public ﬁ  nances and a sustainable economic policy. Joint liability among banks 
or governments for bank resolution costs 
could tempt national governments into pur-suing a more risky economic and ﬁ  scal pol-
icy if the beneﬁ  ts are reaped, above all, at 
national level and the potential costs are 
shared, in part, at European level. The joint liability established via the SRF, which is set to increase over the transitional period, will 
already create such undesirable incentives 
and a common ﬁ  scal backstop would only 
amplify them further.
Problems of this nature will arise above all if 
 national policies can cause national banks 
to fail. The additional undesirable incentives 
created by joint liability will be smaller if in-stitutions avoid national risks by diversifying 
their investments or structures at an inter-
national level. The incentive problems for 
national economic and ﬁ  scal policy will also 
be mitigated by bailing in providers of 
1 A statement issued by the Eurogroup envisages the 
possibility of involving public budgets, although any 
such arrangement that is put in place is to be ﬁ  scally 
neutral over the medium term. See Statement of Euro-
group and ECOFIN Ministers on the SRM backstop, 
18 December 2013.
2 In the event of a precautionary recapitalisation, EU 
legislation on state aid also applies. Pursuant to the 
Banking Communication published by the European 
Commission in July 2013, before state aid is approved, equity holders, hybrid capital holders and subordinated 
debt holders are to be involved in adequate burden- 
sharing (the exact details of which are not speciﬁ  ed in the communication) as long as this does not endanger ﬁ  nancial stability.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
June 2014  
53

equity and debt capital at an earlier stage as 
the threat of liability in the event of a reso-lution will give investors an incentive to en-
sure that banks do not take on excessive 
risk. However, the effectiveness of this cor-
rective infl  uence will hinge crucially on the 
perceived ex ante credibility of the bail- in 
and on how strictly it is applied.
Furthermore, European economic and budgetary surveillance procedures as well as macroprudential supervision may also mitigate undesirable incentives through prompt and resolute action to rectify any national economic and fi  scal policies that may endanger stability. However, it is un-certain whether the tools envisaged in these procedures will always successfully 
identify and correct the build- up of exces-
sive risks in the banking sector in good 
time.
Depending on the perceived severity of 
these incentive problems and the perceived 
effectiveness of the aforementioned cor-
rective infl  uences, some degree of national loss retention could be introduced in the li-
ability cascade, either prior, in parallel or 
subsequent to the resolution fund. The fi  rst 
two cases would constitute a break with the principle of ensuring that the banking sector is generally liable before the tax-
payer, as national taxpayers would become 
liable in the amount of the national loss 
 retention at the same time as or before the 
banking sector. In order not to free pro-
viders of equity and debt capital from their 
liability, this national loss retention would only come into effect after these parties 
had been bailed in as fully as possible.
While the precise details of the common fi  s-
cal backstop are still outstanding, the Euro-
group has recently reached a political 
understanding on a new instrument enab-
ling the ESM to recapitalise banks directly.3 
The general intention of enabling direct re-
capitalisation by the ESM was announced at a political level back in June 2012. This 
instrument is due to come into force when the SSM is launched in November 2014. In 
contrast to the existing ESM instrument of 
indirect recapitalisation through lending to 
governments, ESM funds for supporting banks are to be provided without their 
home country becoming liable to the ESM. 
The SRF would thus be able to approach 
the ESM for funds and – as bank resolution 
costs are to be shared at the European level – this would then constitute a com-
mon fi  scal backstop.
Some of the key aspects of this new instru-
ment have been outlined already. Up to the end of 2015, the ESM will be able to recap-italise a bank directly only after a bail- in of 
8% of the respective bank’s total liabilities 
and after recourse has been made to the ESM member’s national resolution fund. 
These prerequisites for direct bank recapit-
alisation are in line with the minimum level of bail- in stipulated in the BRRD before use 
can be made of the national resolution fund.
4 As of 2016, the use of the bail- in 
regulations as defi  ned in the BRRD will be a precondition for direct recapitalisation. This will ensure that the ESM direct recapitalisa-tion instrument cannot be used to sidestep 
these bail- in regulations. Furthermore, the 
existing ESM indirect recapitalisation instru-
ment is to be applied fi  rst.5 The more nar-
rowly the prerequisites for using the direct 
recapitalisation instrument are defi  ned, the 
more likely it is that – after making full use of the support funds available in the SRF – the member states in question will continue 
to fund backstops themselves during the transitional period. The advantage of pro-
viding ESM funds for direct recapitalisation 
in the form of a loan rather than a guaran-tee is that it will make the extent of the risks 
more transparent to the taxpayer and the 
limit of €60 billion on  direct recapitalisation harder to circumvent.
3 See Remarks by Jeroen Dijsselbloem at the press con-
ference following the Eurogroup meeting of 5  May 
2014 and the Statement by the President of the Euro-
group on the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument of 10 June 2014.4 However, the BRRD bail- in instrument fi  rst has to be transposed into national law by 1 January 2016.
5 Should the ESM indirect recapitalisation instrument 
be used before the BRRD comes into force on 1 Janu-
ary 2015, only EU state aid rules would have to be 
observed.Deutsche Bundesbank

would be to transfer additional economic, fis -
cal and taxation responsibilities to the Euro -
pean level; the alternative would be to modify 
the procedure for resolution financing, and 
thus ultimately the degree of mutualisation, while leaving the member states largely au -
tonomous in their economic and fiscal policy 
(see “Resolution financing”, pages 50 to 52).
Particularly in the member states with more 
stable banking sectors, the indirect mutualisa -
tion of liability among banks via the SRF is likely 
to be met with criticism. The idea that SRF con -
tributions will cause more robust institutions to 
pay indirectly for risks which were taken in the 
past by other, less conservative institutions in 
foreign countries –  and which have since 
 materialised – is not unfounded. However, a 
counterargument would be that, at least fol -
lowing the SSM’s launch in November 2014, 
supervisory control will be harmonised at the 
European level and that the SRM is aimed at 
precisely such a mutualisation of liability in 
order to promote market integration. Yet con -
tinuing to differentiate, for resolution purposes, 
between institutions according to their home 
country in the long term would perpetuate the 
fragmentation of the European banking sector 
in a manner which is incompatible with the 
principles of the single market. In addition, it is 
important to bear in mind that the sole 
 alternative to transferring liability for banking 
sectors to the European level is ultimately a fis -
cal backstop at the national level, which would 
force the taxpayer to bear any losses. This 
would run counter to the objectives of the 
resolution regime. The current compromise can 
therefore be regarded as the outcome of 
weighing up different priorities: faced with the 
principle of dual subsidiarity (the private sector 
should be liable before the public sector and, at 
least during the transitional period, the individ -
ual member states should be liable before the 
European level), the first dimension has been 
prioritised over the second. All things con -
sidered, this decision is justifiable.However, it would not be appropriate to mutu -
alise liability for existing capital gaps on bank 
balance sheets (known as legacy assets). These 
gaps arose on the watch of national super -
visors and must therefore be closed at the na -
tional level before liability is transferred to the 
European level. Only then can the banking 
union, which will entail European liability for any failures or omissions arising under Euro -
pean responsibility, be launched. The compre -
hensive assessment of the SSM banks, which is 
now being performed (until summer 2014) 
under the ECB’s leadership, is therefore cru -
cially important. It will identify legacy assets, 
which will then have to be eliminated under 
national responsibility. The SRM Regulation 
allows the member states sufficient time to do this; although the SRB will be given preliminary powers with effect from 1 January 2015, it will 
not have full resolution powers until 1 January 
2016 (Article 88 SRM Regulation). The member 
states should use this additional time to thor -
oughly address the legacy asset problem – 
while ensuring that recourse to public funds is 
only possible once private investors have shoul -
dered an adequate share of the costs, as is re -
quired by EU law on state aid.18
Consequently, neither the banking union in 
general nor the SRM in particular should be 
viewed as a quick fix to patch up existing prob-
lems. Indeed, the SRM is intended to reduce the likelihood of future financial crises and to 
alleviate their impact should they still arise. 
Nonetheless, a more comprehensive approach 
will be needed to overcome the current finan -
cial crisis, which stems from the failings of the 
past.Will the SRM

Changes in the methodology and 
classifications of the balance of payments 
and the international investment position
The German balance of payments is a comprehensive systematic presentation of all economic 
transactions between residents and non-  r esidents in a given reporting period. The underlying 
methodological concept will be brought into line with the revised standard of the International 
Monetary Fund when the data for the reporting month of May are published in July 2014. The 
balance of payments statistics will then be consistent with the framework set out in the sixth edi -
tion of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). The new 
rules are binding for the EU member states by virtue of a Council regulation amended by the 
European Commission. Moreover, the reporting requirements for Eurosystem national central 
banks vis-  à-  vis the European Central Bank (ECB) are stipulated in detail in an ECB guideline.
Although the basic structure of the balance of payments, which includes the current account, the 
capital account and the financial account, will be retained under the new regulations, the existing framework for recording and capturing international economic relationships has been modified 
in many respects in order to take account of economic and technical changes. New sub-  ac count 
classifications, more detailed breakdowns and the inclusion of transactions that were not previ -
ously recorded will increase the informative value of the statistical accounting system. All in all, 
the methodological frameworks for the national accounts and the balance of payments have 
now been fully harmonised.
The relationship between the flow variables in the financial account and the stock variables in the 
international investment position is emphasised by an integrated statement. It reveals whether 
changes in the individual stock positions result from transactions, valuation effects or other 
adjustments. Following this logic, the use of signs in the financial account has henceforth 
changed. Net capital exports will now be viewed as an increase in net external assets and there -
fore – in a change to previous practice – recorded with a positive sign. The relationship between 
cross-  bor der assets and the resulting income flows will also be a prominent aspect.
The quantitative impact of the methodological changes on the balances of the major sub-  
accounts is relatively small. The amount by which the current account balance has been lowered for purely methodological reasons is on a similar scale to the normal annual revisions. As a result, the ratio of the current account balance to gross domestic product (GDP) monitored by the Euro -
pean Commission as part of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure has been revised down-
wards slightly. It is now no longer continuously above the indicative threshold, as it had been 
since 2007.Deutsche Bundesbank

The informative value of 
the balance of payments statistics
The German economy is deeply integrated into 
the international division of labour due to the 
high degree of openness of its real economy 
and financial sector. The balance of payments 
and the international investment position pro -
vide a systematic and comprehensive presenta -
tion of multi-  f aceted external economic inter -
relations.1 The balance of payments statistics 
are period-  based and r ecord the value of all the 
economic transactions between residents and 
non- residents2 in a given period. For example, 
they provide information about the volume of 
goods or services Germany exported in a year, 
quarter or month to which countries, the 
amount of direct investment conducted or the 
volume of foreign securities purchased by do -
mestic investors. By contrast, the international 
investment position shows the holdings of all 
financial assets and liabilities between residents 
and non-  r esidents at a certain point in time, 
valued using the market prices and exchange 
rates on the relevant reporting date. Among other things, it allows the level and compos-
ition of the net external assets to be monitored. Since the launch of European Monetary Union 
in 1999, Germany’s net external assets have 
 increased from 4.5% of nominal GDP to over 
45% of GDP by the end of 2013.
To enable the international comparison of these statistics, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has, in cooperation with experts from national and international institutions, 
 developed a framework for compiling the bal -
ance of payments and the international invest -
ment position, the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, 
which is now in its sixth edition (BPM6).3 The 
statistical reporting requirements for the EU 
and euro-  ar ea countries in these areas are laid 
down in a Council regulation amended by the 
European Commission. The data that must be 
submitted to the ECB are furthermore specified 
in an ECB guideline.4 However, a few devi -ations from the internationally accepted meth -
odology still exist. These are due, among other 
factors, to the limits of what is practical, but 
also to historically founded and partly codified 
national points of reference in the statistical 
collection framework.
National external indicators are increasingly 
being used to identify potential undesirable de -
velopments early on. In addition to the Stability and Growth Pact and the Excessive Deficit Pro-
cedure, the EU countries have introduced the 
Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP).5 It 
consists of a set of, at present, 11 economic 
indicators with recommended thresholds in-
tended to provide initial warnings of internal or 
external imbalances. External indicators play a 
prominent role. The European Commission 
analyses the current account balance as a per -
centage of GDP in greater detail if the three-  
year backward-  m oving average of a member 
state has fallen below -4% or risen above +6%. 
The analogous lower threshold for the net international investment position is fixed at 
-35% of GDP . As a further indicator, the share 
of world exports should not fall by more than 
6% within a period of five years.6
Regardless of this, a single monetary policy re -
quires statistical information for the entire cur -
rency area as a basis for making decisions. This Balance of

information includes a consolidated balance of 
payments and a joint international investment 
position for the euro area, compiled by the ECB 
from the member states’ national contribu -
tions. The largest contribution to this in terms 
of value is provided by the Bundesbank in the 
form of its data for Germany.
Reasons for revising the 
 recommendations
The framework for compiling balance of pay -
ments statistics was last updated in 1993. Since 
then, globalisation has advanced rapidly due to 
new types of information technology and the 
removal of trade barriers and capital controls. 
As a result, the global export of goods and ser -
vices has increased fivefold in nominal terms 
over the last 20 years, while global GDP has 
tripled.7 International corporate structures with 
long value-  added chains, complex financial  
linkages and ownership structures are becom -
ing increasingly common in the economy.8
Cross-  bor der financial assets and the associ -
ated income flows have become considerably 
more significant due to the dynamic growth in the international capital markets. However, be-
cause the transaction volumes often account 
for only a small part of the stocks, the stocks 
themselves are often more useful as an indica-
tor of dependencies and potential contagion 
channels. The importance of the volume of ex-ternal stocks is reflected, inter alia, in the G20 
recommendations dating from 2009 on closing 
the information gaps identified during the re -
cent financial crisis.9
To further improve the consistency of the 
macroeconomic accounts systems, the balance 
of payments manual was revised at the same 
time as the national accounts regulations and 
adapted in line with their development. To -
gether, the European Commission, the IMF, the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN) 
and the World Bank revised and published the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008).10 The 
accounting rules for the EU countries are speci -
fied in further detail and enshrined in the Euro -
pean System of National and Regional Ac -
counts (ESA 2010).11 The changeover to the 
two new international standards will take place 
in the EU in the course of 2014. The concepts 
for the national and international balance of 
payments and national accounts in the EU 
countries will then be completely consistent 
with one another.
Significant changes to the 
current account and the 
 capital account
New terms have been introduced within the 
current account. Compensation of employees 
and investment income are now referred to as 
primary income, which also includes taxes on production and imports as well as subsidies 
and rents. Current transfers have also been re -
named, and are now referred to as secondary 
income. The capital transfers will henceforth be 
termed the capital account.
Furthermore, BPM6 redefines the boundary be -
tween goods and services transactions. Trans -
actions relating to produced goods are listed 
under “trade in goods” as long as there is a 
change of ownership between a resident and a 
non- r esident (change of ownership principle).Increasing

As a result, merchanting12 is no longer seen as 
a service for wholesale arrangements; instead, 
the new recommendations emphasise the 
change of ownership of the goods. For this 
reason, merchanting is now treated as a special form of trade in goods and is shown as a sep -
arate sub-  item within this account. Goods ac -
quired under merchanting are recorded as negative exports, because they are acquired 
solely in order to generate corresponding sales 
(positive exports).13 This new methodology 
does not affect the current account balance, 
but does lead to significant changes in terms of the geographical breakdown. Under the previ -
ous rules (BPM5), net earnings from merchant-
ing corresponded to the service provided, 
which was recorded by convention vis-  à-  vis the 
economic territory of the purchaser. Now, the 
balance per country is calculated based on all 
transfers of ownership of goods under mer -
chanting for that particular country.14 Another 
change results from a more legal slant with re-
gard to accounts denominated in precious 
metals.15 Because of their contractual charac -
ter, they are now classified as foreign currency 
accounts and not as repositories. The account 
movements therefore no longer appear under 
merchanting, but as financial transactions in 
other investment.
According to the new methodology, imports 
and exports of goods related to manufacturing 
services where goods remain the property of 
the contracting party are no longer recorded in 
goods. Instead, the processing fee an enter -
prise receives for processing the goods is re -
corded as a service. The same principle applies 
to cross-  b order repairs of goods. Under the 
new methodology, the balance resulting from 
cross-  bor der movements of goods before and 
after processing may differ from the processing 
fee if, for example, market prices for the goods change during the processing period. The new 
reporting method could therefore lead to 
changes in the current account balance.
The strict application of the transfer of owner -
ship principle in the balance of payments statis -tics has led to greater conceptual differences 
between these and the foreign trade statistics. 
Such differences occur whenever goods physic -
ally cross the border (which is of crucial import-
ance for the foreign trade statistics) without a 
change in ownership between residents and 
non- r esidents. Any such disparities between 
the two sets of statistics are shown under “sup -
plementary trade items”.
At the same time as introducing BPM6, Ger -
many’s balance of payment statistics will adapt 
the accounting practice used for electricity and 
gas to meet international practices. In particu -
lar, electricity trading via commodity forward 
contracts has increased distinctly due to the lib -
eralisation of the European energy market. This has resulted in a sizeable increase in the gross 
figures, as chain transactions are frequently 
concluded in such cases. The intention of the 
traders here is to align their contractual obliga -
tions with the amount of electricity that is actu -
ally produced (but cannot be stored) at the 
agreed delivery date. Forward transactions of 
this kind concluded between residents and 
non- r esidents are now recorded solely under 
“financial derivatives” in the financial account. 
Only actual cross-  bor der electricity deliveries as 
defined in the foreign trade statistics remain in 
the goods account.
Trade in services between residents and non-  
residents has seen a remarkable upswing in re -
cent years. The more detailed information on 
services required under BPM6 is supplemented

12 Merchanting takes place when residents purchase 
goods abroad which they then sell to other non-  r esidents 
without first bringing the goods into their country of resi -
dence.13 Net exports of goods under merchanting shown on the 
export side under “trade in goods” may therefore be nega -
tive as a result of changes in inventories.
14 Negative merchanting balances are often visible when 
looking at individual countries. As a result of the new methodology, in extreme cases, the overall item “goods, 
exports” with this country may be negative.
15 For these types of sight account, the claim to delivery 
relates only to type and quality; the account holder does 
not have any ownership rights to certain specified precious metal holdings.Deutsche Bundesbank

tions which, in the EU, have been partially in -
corporated into the new statistical reporting 
requirements. Here, the Manual on Statistics of 
International Trade in Services (MSITS)16 serves 
as the key guideline. This manual, designed in 
particular to meet the needs of the World Trade 
Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in 
Services,17 was published in an updated format 
in 2010.18
Such disaggregated data are not least of par -
ticular relevance in connection with the EU’s 
harmonised foreign trade policy as a member 
of the WTO as well as for bilateral and regional 
negotiations. Moreover, the more detailed in -
formation better fulfils the requirements of the 
input-  output analysis which, as an integr al part 
of the national accounts, provides a statistical 
picture of the production links within an econ -
omy and of the flows of goods and services 
between the domestic economy and the rest of the world.
Data concerning insurance and pension ser -
vices will in future be compiled in close collab -
oration with the Federal Statistical Office. Ex -
ports are estimated on the basis of the produc-
tion value of German insurers derived from 
annual data provided by the insurance super -
visory authority and calculated as the differ -
ence between premiums and expected claims. 
Premiums also encompass premium supple -
ments representing income of policyholders 
from insurance technical reserves and taken 
into account when calculating the services 
component. Once adjusted for the services 
component, premiums and claims payments 
will continue to be recorded under “secondary 
income” in the balance of payments. Apart from any premium supplements being taken 
into account, the calculation of reinsurance 
services has also changed. They are now calcu -
lated in exactly the same way as other non-  life 
insurance services. In accordance with the 
BPM6 concept, insurance technical reserves 
will henceforth be shown under a new com -
ponent in “other investment”.A further new aspect of the balance of pay -
ments statistics (and which is in line with the 
national accounts) is the introduction of Finan-cial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured 
( FISIM). Her e, the underlying consideration is 
that financial intermediaries frequently choose 
to be remunerated for a service indirectly 
through the associated interest margin. Under 
BPM5, the actual income from lending and 
 deposit rates was recorded in its entirety under 
“income”; however, in future such interest in -
come is to be adjusted for  FISIM services. These 
services will be calculated by the Federal Statis -
tical Office within the framework of the na -
tional accounts using a designated model 
where the deviation of the actual interest rate 
from the respective reference rate (which does 
not include a service fee) serves as the price 
component and is multiplied by the deposit or 
credit volume as the quantity component.19 
Under primary income, non-  b anks’ interest in -
come on deposits held abroad is to be ex -
panded to include FISIM services,20 whereas 
interest expenditure on cross-  bor der loans will 
be reduced to take account of such services.21 
Conversely, the interest revenue of domestic 
banks will fall and their interest expenditure will 
 increase. FISIM services will correspondingly 
appear as imports and exports under “financial … in European

18 The statistical reporting requirements applying to the EU 
extend beyond BPM6 but are not as stringent as MSITS 
2010 in every regard. For example, BPM6 advocates just 
three sub-  categories for other business services, wher eas 
MSITS 2010 breaks these down by as many as a further 
three levels; the EU stipulations fall somewhere between 
these two models.
19 The actual income from lending and deposit rates is 
calculated using the ESCB’s interest rate statistics. As a rule, 
when determining the reference rate, use is made of the 
relevant interbank rate, distinguishing between currencies.
20 This rests on the assumption that the bank implicitly 
reduced the deposit interest rate by the value of the im -
puted banking service beforehand. The new procedure is 
equivalent to an alternative scenario in which the customer 
would on the one hand receive a higher level of deposit 
interest from the bank, but on the other hand be required to pay a fee for the service rendered.21 It is therefore assumed that part of the interest on the 
loan serves to cover the costs of the service provided by the 
bank in connection with the bank transaction.Deutsche Bundesbank

services”; the current account balance remains 
unaffected by this shift from the primary in -
come to the services item.
In the case of transactions involving intellectual 
property, BPM6 distinguishes between charges 
for the use, distribution and reproduction and 
the outright purchase or sale of these rights. Charges for the use, distribution or reproduc -
tion of intellectual property are now to be re -
corded as “services”. Fees for the use of soft -
ware and audio-  visual media22 are recorded 
under “computer services” and “personal, cul -
tural, and recreational services” respectively; by 
contrast, all transactions entailing the right to 
reproduce or commercially distribute intellec -
tual property are shown in the new service cat -
egory “charges for the use of intellectual prop -
erty”. Licence fees allowing the use of the out -
comes of research or commercial property 
rights, eg for trademarks, are also displayed 
here.
When acquiring or selling intellectual property 
rights, a distinction is now made between pro -
duced and non-  pr oduced non-  financial assets. 
The first category of assets includes outcomes 
of research and development such as patents, 
copyrights or industrial process concepts, 
which are henceforth to be listed as “services” 
under the relevant category.23 By contrast, 
transactions involving non-  pr oduced non-  
financial assets such as trademarks or emissions 
permits are to be recorded in the capital 
 account.
Under BPM6, the breakdown of the investment 
income item corresponds to that used for re -
cording financial transactions in that income 
flows are initially listed using the functional cat -
egories “direct investment”, “portfolio invest -
ment”, “other investment” and “reserve 
assets”, then broken down again within these 
categories according to the respective financial 
instrument. Using this more fine-  tuned classifi -
cation approach, income is assigned to the resident sectors and, in the case of securities 
claims, to the sector of the non-  r esident issuer. The same classification principle leads to a dir -
ect allocation of the income variables con -
tained in the current account to the corres -
ponding items in the financial account and the 
international investment position (IIP). In terms 
of value, the income data change due to the 
adjustment of interest income for FISIM ser -
vices and to the recalculation of insurance 
technical reserves. The latter are shown separ -
ately in a new item, namely “insurance and 
pension services”. This applies equally to the 
reinvested earnings of investment funds, which 
henceforth are to be presented on a separate 
basis. Moreover, income now also encom -
passes receipts arising from long-  term  con -
struction projects, as these are no longer 
 regarded as services and are instead treated 
as direct investment.
Integrated approach to the 
 financial account and the 
international investment 
 position
BPM6 brings the use of signs in the balance of 
payments in line with the national accounts. 
This results in changes to the financial account. 
Until now, the decisive factor was the direction 
of the imputed cash flow involved in a transac-
tion, with capital exports being recorded as a 
negative change and capital imports being al -
lotted a plus sign. However, under the new 
convention, it is the change in the underlying 
stocks which is of key importance. Increases in 
claims and liabilities are entered as a positive 
change, while decreases are presented as a 
negative change. This means that the financial 
account balance is also allocated a different 
sign. Unlike in the past, a positive change now 
signifies a net capital export because it entails 
an increase in the net external assets.Differentiated

The relationships that exist between the finan -
cial account, the IIP and investment income are 
now clearly highlighted using a common break -
down for the various sets of figures. For in -
stance, in future it will be possible to set stocks 
and investment income in relation to one an -
other in detail according to the financing in -
struments involved. The new methodology 
largely adopts the classifications for sectors and for financial claims and liabilities that are used as standard in the national accounts. Neverthe -
less, the current push for greater detail is not 
always feasible in practice. Yields on bonds can initially only be gauged according to the sector of the domestic investor in a very rough man -
ner using their relative shares in an entity’s total 
stock of assets. These estimates are no more 
than approximate, and they fail to produce any 
differences in the yield profile of the various 
 investor groups.
The IIP is depicted in an integrated statement, thus making it possible to identify and analyse 
for the individual items how changes in the 
stock result from financial transactions or other changes. The difference between the initial and 
the end IIP value of a given period is deter -
mined by financial account transactions, the valuation effects arising from market price or exchange rate fluctuations and a variable re -
ferred to as “other adjustments” which can re -sult from, say, write-  downs on non-  col lectable 
credit claims. At the aggregate level, the above 
factors are compounded by structural effects 
caused by portfolio shifts.24
While transactions have proved to be the most 
impactful factor in terms of changes in net assets over an extended period of time, the 
other two variables cited above have nonethe-
less been significant and at certain points in time have even been the dominant force. In 
2007, 2008 and 2011 they outstripped capital 
flows abroad, with the effect that Germany’s net external assets dwindled. Between 2007 
and 2012, when the international financial and economic crisis was in full swing, net assets de -
creased by around €220 billion due to valu -
ation adjustments alone. However, these valu -
ation losses due to price and exchange rate effects only partially explain why Germany’s net external assets have grown much more 
slowly than might be expected considering the 
cumulative financial account balance for this 
period. Not least, an additional role is played by statistical factors emanating from the differing Uniform

primary statistics that are used to compile the 
balance of payments and the IIP figures.25
The bulk of the net valuation losses were due 
solely to the gains in German sovereign bond 
prices, ie to an upward revaluation of external 
liabilities. In the wake of the financial crisis, the global interest rate level fell and Germany tem -
porarily benefited from strong safe haven 
flows, a phenomenon which was reflected in 
rising prices. Non-  r esidents’ holdings were con -
sequently given a higher valuation, thereby 
pushing up German gross debt. Although a higher market valuation impacts on yields, it 
does not mean that the German government’s 
payment obligations vis-  à-  vis the r est of the 
world have increased. Upon maturity, the 
bonds are redeemed at their nominal value and 
the transaction is booked in the financial 
 account. The difference compared with the fig -
ure previously recorded in the IIP is shown in the integrated statement under “valuation changes”. This example illustrates why, when 
assessing cross-  bor der financial interlinkages, 
IIP data on sectors, maturity and country break -
down need to be as comprehensive and robust 
as possible to enable interest rate and foreign 
exchange risks to be estimated, mutual de -
pendencies to be detected and transmission 
channels for possible imbalances to be identi -
fied.
This is all the more the case as holdings of 
cross-  bor der assets have increased sharply. In 
this context, the data on gross stocks are more 
striking and, with regard to potential macro -
prudential risks, are ultimately more informa -
tive than the net figures. At the end of 2013, Germany’s gross external assets amounted to 
€6.6 trillion, which equates to almost two-  and-  
a- half times its GDP in 2 013. Euro-  ar ea coun -
tries accounted for well over half of these 
assets, of which around €835 billion were at -
tributable to those countries especially hard hit by the crisis.
26
With regard to the statistical recording of direct 
investment relationships, two fundamental changes have been made which also apply to 
income from direct investment. First, these statistics are now to be recorded using the 
asset/liability principle as standard, rather than 
the directional principle, thereby bringing them into line with the methodology of the financial 
accounts and the financial assets and liabilities 
account. Under the asset/liability principle, 
assets and liabilities of all domestic units are 
 recorded in the statistics, irrespective of the 
type of direct investment relationship. The main difference between this principle and the direc -
tional principle that was previously used con -
cerns reverse investments (loans granted coun-
ter to the nature of the direct investment rela -
tionship).27 Up until now, these have been net -
ted against the assets or liabilities of the direct 
investors. Of course, the direct investment bal-
ance is not affected by this methodologically 
induced extension of the balance sheet.
The second major change affecting direct in-
vestment is the separate recording of credit re -
lationships between fellow enterprises which 
have no direct investment relationship (ie nei -
ther of them is a direct investor in the other) 
but belong to the same group. Up until now, 
the financial relationships between resident 
and non-  r esident fellow enterprises have been 
recorded as links between direct investors and 
direct investment enterprises. The new meth -
odology pays heed to differentiating as much 
as possible when recording capital flows be -
tween the enterprises of a direct investment 
group.
Another new aspect is that construction pro -
jects which exist for more than one year are to 
be treated as a separate fictitious unit within Important for

27 In Germany, owing to the available statistical data, rela -
tionships running counter to the actual direction of the 
capital participation are only recorded in the case of loans 
and not in the case of equity capital or other debt instru -
ments, such as bonds.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
June 2014  
64

the direct investment group and the activities 
carried out as part of the project are thus no 
longer to be classified as services. This affects 
the majority of construction reported in the 
balance of payments. As previous collections of 
statistical data in line with BPM5 did not differ -
entiate according to how long the construction 
project had existed, until the end of 2013 all construction reported in the balance of pay-
ments is regarded as direct investment. The 
creation or completion of a construction pro -
ject is booked as new investment in or liquid -
ation of capital assets, and the remuneration 
for the services provided is recorded as primary 
income. From 2014 onwards, services in con -
nection with short-  term construction pr ojects 
are to be recorded under services. Although 
this will result in minor transitional problems in quantitative terms at the end of 2013 / begin -
ning of 2014 in the time series for services and 
primary income, the current account balance 
as a whole will not be affected.
As is the case for investment income, portfolio 
investment will in future contain reinvested 
earnings of investment funds as a standard 
component. Other investment will also com -
prise the items “insurance and pension ser-
vices” and “other equity”. Furthermore, the 
sub- item “curr ency and deposits” will be de -
fined more broadly and, alongside gold ac -
counts, will also include in particular all inter -
bank positions and all external liabilities of do -
mestic banks, which in the past were primarily 
classified as loans. With regard to reserve 
assets, gold transactions and positions will in 
future be subdivided into gold bullion, which 
includes gold bars and allocated gold accounts, and gold receivables, to which no specific gold holdings are assigned.
New data sources  
and data availability
The new requirements entail numerous changes 
for the reporting parties, data recording, and 
data processing and provision. The key require -ment of a more fine-  t uned breakdown has 
made it necessary to collect additional informa -
tion and exploit new data sources. The previ -
ous reporting forms have been supplemented 
or replaced by new ones; parallel to this, to en -
sure a seamless and thus faster processing of 
the data, the electronic submission of corpor -
ate reports has been made a legal requirement.
With regard to the submission of external stat -
istics to international organisations, the previ -
ous codes for individual statistical time series 
have been replaced by a system of harmonised 
time series keys. The new Statistical Data and 
Metadata Exchange (SDMX) enables specific in -
formation on the underlying time series to be 
found at a certain place in the code. This makes 
it much easier for the user to classify the cor -
responding stocks and flows, as well as to 
compare data series from various national and 
international sources.Construction to

Within the EU, the changeover to BPM6 and

2014, with individual countries setting their 
own timetables within a given framework. In 
July 2014, the Bundesbank will for the first time

Estimating the  
quantitative impact
BPM6 tends to reduce the current account sur -
plus, as some items that were previously 
counted towards the surplus are now booked 
in the capital account or the financial account. 
On an average of the period 2000 to 2012, the 
level of fluctuation remains in the mid-  single-  
digit billions and is thus comparatively low.32 
The differences in the individual years range from -€14 billion in 2011 to +€2.4 billion in 2009 and are thus of no greater significance 
than the usual annual revisions, which in recent 
years fell within a range of +€3 billion and 
+€17 billion. The conceptual changes result in a 
slight reduction in the ratio of the current ac -
count balance to GDP , which is monitored by the European Commission as part of the 
Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. Conse -
quently, the 6% threshold has no longer been 
exceeded every year since 2007.Within the current account, the new classifica -
tion of merchanting represents the biggest 
change; the balance of +€17 billion in 2012 has 
been reclassified from services to goods. Con -
versely, the positive balances for processing 
fees and repairs (totalling +€2 billion) will now 
be recorded under manufacturing services. 
Consequently, the goods balance is higher than 
under the former concept, while the services 
balance is lower. This is especially the case as 
further surplus items have been factored out of 
the services balance, and the inclusion of  FISIM 
services (+€2 billion) in this account rather than 
under primary income also does not compen -
sate for the factored out items.
The biggest shift from the current account to the financial account is attributable to com -
modity forward contracts in electricity trading, Changeover

Cash withdrawals at the point of sale: 
motives for use and implications for 
cash holding
The present article aims to investigate the role played by point-  of-  sale (POS) withdr awals – ie 
withdrawals of cash at supermarket and filling station checkouts – for consumers in Germany 
when obtaining cash and the implications that this has for their cash holding. The empirical 
analysis is based on data from the Bundesbank’s 2011 study on payment behaviour, which was 
the first time that questions were asked specifically about this new option for withdrawing cash.
A descriptive analysis of the data shows that point-  of-  sale withdr awals are being used only to a 
small extent in Germany at present. An average consumer in Germany covers no more than 1% 
of his or her annual cash requirements using this form of cash withdrawal. Of those surveyed, 
92% stated that they had not made use of this option at all so far. Persons making POS cash 
withdrawals did so very largely because they had forgotten to obtain cash elsewhere in another way. The most commonly cited reasons for not making POS withdrawals were a sufficiently large 
number of available automated teller machines (ATMs) located nearby, a lack of confidence in 
retailers, and not being aware of the existence of this facility.
The probability of making a POS withdrawal is higher for persons living in rural areas and who 
hold an account with a bank which has a low ATM coverage. Furthermore, it is evident that per -
sons making more frequent use of POS withdrawals keep a lower stock of cash on average. The resulting effects on the amounts of cash held for transaction purposes in Germany are, however, negligible in macroeconomic terms – even if this facility were to be used more widely in future.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Despite the steady increase in card payments, 
cash was still the most frequently used means 
of payment in German retail outlets in 2011 
with a transaction share of 82%.1 What con -
sumers particularly like about cash is that it is 
quick and convenient to use and also protects 
their privacy. On the other hand, the fact that 
cash is used up when shopping and constantly 
has to be “stocked up” might be felt to be a drawback. Besides bank counters and auto-
mated teller machines (ATMs) as the traditional sources for withdrawing cash, there is now also 
the option at various retailers of withdrawing 
cash at the checkout. The present article is con -
cerned with this new method of withdrawing 
cash, known as point-  of-  sale (POS)  withdr awals.
Innovations in the field of supplying cash to 
consumers are of great interest to central 
banks, since this may lead to changes in the 
demand for cash. In the past, for example, the 
universal availability of ATMs as an alternative 
to withdrawals at the counter led in many 
countries to a marked decline in the average 
amount of cash held for transaction purposes.2 
The option of POS withdrawals makes con -
sumers’ cash management easier in two ways. 
First, it creates an additional cost-  fr ee possibil -
ity of obtaining cash, as no fees are charged for 
POS withdrawals in most cases. Second, with -
drawals at the checkout save time, since they 
are made at the same time as the purchases. 
Such changes in the cost structure could lead 
to consumers changing their withdrawal be -
haviour. In much the same way as after the 
widespread introduction of ATMs, it is possible 
that consumers would withdraw cash more 
often but in smaller amounts. As a result, the 
average amount of cash held for transaction 
purposes would decline.
The present article first gives an overview of the 
scale on which consumers in Germany cur -
rently make use of POS withdrawals and what 
factors play a part in this. Furthermore, we look into the impact that greater use of POS with-
drawals has on consumers’ cash holding.
Cash withdrawals at the 
point of sale
For the purpose of this article, POS withdrawals 
are understood to be the option of withdraw -
ing cash at a retail checkout at the same time 
as making the payment transaction.3 POS with-
drawals are currently offered by various super -
markets and filling stations. The methods used differ in terms of the conditions of use for the consumers and how they work technically.
The methods used at supermarkets are also 
commonly known by the term “Cash back”. In 
this instance, customers can withdraw cash in 
the amount of up to €200 when purchasing goods to the value of at least €20 which are 
bought using a payment card with PIN author -
isation. To do this, the amount to be deducted at the card terminal is increased by the desired amount to be withdrawn. The withdrawn cash is paid out directly by the employees from the cash register. The withdrawals per se are free of 
charge. For some customers, however, general fees for the use of the card may be charged by their bank.
Withdrawing cash at filling stations is not con -
ditional on making a purchase or refuelling. 
Since this option is based on a cooperative 
agreement with a commercial bank, withdraw -
ing cash is subject to withdrawal fees for cus -
tomers of other banks. A further difference 
from the supermarket schemes is that the par -
ticipating filling stations operate integrated POS as an 
 
additional with-drawal option alongside ATM and counter withdrawals

cash management systems. These have the 
 advantage that the money paid in is checked 
for  a uthenticity and fitness not only by the 
cashiers but also by machine. Automatic check -
ing is performed in accordance with a proced -
ure  certified by the Eurosystem.
POS withdrawals have various advantages from 
the retailers’ point of view. This facility can at -
tract additional customers who visit the retail outlet because they need cash. At the super -
markets, sales my increase if consumers who 
want to withdraw cash have to buy more prod -
ucts to reach the minimum purchase amount 
of €20. At the filling stations, the magazines of the fully automatic cashier systems have to be emptied less frequently. The higher transaction 
costs resulting from POS withdrawals are a 
drawback for the retail trade, however. For every 
debit card transaction, a given percentage of 
the recorded amount – irrespective of whether 
it has been paid or withdrawn  – has to be 
transferred to the payment service provider.
From the consumers’ perspective, POS with -
drawal facilities present an additional with -
drawal option which is generally free of charge. This is an advantage primarily for customers of 
banks with a thinly spread network of ATMs. 
Furthermore, customers can save time by mak -
ing POS withdrawals as they can combine pur -
chasing and withdrawal transactions. Never -
theless, this procedure also has some features 
that consumers might feel to be a disadvan -
tage. POS withdrawals at supermarkets depend 
on paying for the goods using a card. In view 
of the above-  mentioned lar ge share of transac -
tions at German retail outlets which have hith-erto been conducted in cash, most consumers 
would therefore have to alter their payment 
behaviour in order to withdraw cash there. 
Added to this is the fact that the withdrawal 
process which consumers in supermarkets have to perform themselves at the POS payment ter -
minal requires data input and actions which differ from those at an ATM, which likewise 
 requires a certain degree of familiarisation. 
Moreover, customers might feel it disadvanta -geous that when withdrawing cash in a super -
market – unlike at a bank ATM – the banknotes paid out to them have not been checked auto -
matically for authenticity and fitness. Even so, 
they enter the same risk when accepting change and in the case of withdrawals at a 
bank counter.
Cash management of 
 consumers in Germany
According to the Bundesbank’s 2011 study on 
payment behaviour, a representative consumer 
in Germany withdraws an amount of cash to -
talling €8,072 annually. In Germany, there gen -
erally exists the option of obtaining cash from 
ATMs, at bank counters or at selected points of 
sale. Consumers can withdraw differing 
amounts of cash and decide how often and 
where they wish to withdraw it. This raises the 
question as to the strategy they use to obtain 
their cash.
The chart on page 73 shows how often ATM, 
counter and POS withdrawals are usually con -
ducted. In addition to the information from 
2011, the 2008 figures are shown for compara-tive purposes.
4 By far the most frequently used 
location for withdrawing cash is the ATM. Of 
those surveyed, 89% (2008: 88%) stated that 
they regularly visit an ATM, with the average 
user making 40 (2008: 43) withdrawals a year. 
Counter withdrawals are made much more 
rarely. Of those surveyed, 54% state that they 
had not made use of this option at all so far. 
The remaining 46% make a counter with -
drawal about 13 (2008: 17) times a year.5 POS 
withdrawals are made least often. Only 8% of

Underlying data:
the Deutsche Bundesbank’s study on payment behaviour
The Bundesbank’s study on payment be-
haviour provides the underlying data for the 
present analysis. These data are derived 
from a survey of consumer payment and withdrawal behaviour which the Bundes-bank conducts at regular intervals in co-
operation with a market research provider. 
Data from the years 2008 and 2011 are available to date. The surveys of around 
2,000 people in each case are representa-
tive of the German- speaking population 
aged 18 years and above.
Numerous analyses have already been con-
ducted on the payment behaviour of con-
sumers in German retail outlets using these 
data.1 In a second step, this article provides 
more detailed information about the with-
drawal behaviour of consumers, in particu-lar the use of POS withdrawals, which were 
recorded in the survey for the fi  rst time in 
2011.
Questions about withdrawal behaviour are 
generally aimed at determining– 
which places of withdrawal are used 
(ATM, bank counter, POS) and how fre-
quently
– the average size of the amounts with-
drawn
– and why certain places of withdrawal are used or not used.
Here are some examples of questions asked in 2011.
To all participants
– 
How often do you generally withdraw 
cash at the following places: ATM, bank counter, POS?– 
How high is the average amount per 
withdrawal at the respective place?
– How much cash do you usually still have in your wallet or purse before you decide to make a new withdrawal of cash?
To users of POS withdrawals– Why do you use the option of withdraw-
ing cash at supermarkets and fi  lling sta-
tion counters?
To non- users of POS withdrawals– Why do you not use the option of with-drawing cash at supermarkets and fi  lling station counters?

use of this withdrawal method, with users 
making POS withdrawals roughly nine times a 
year.
The chart below shows the average amounts 
withdrawn at ATMs, bank counters and at the 
POS for the respective users. An average ATM 
user withdraws €215 per transaction. The aver -
age amount of a counter withdrawal is signifi -
cantly higher at €436 (2008: €376). This is due 
to the fact that counter withdrawals are being used more and more rarely to cover the every -
day need for cash. Rather, they are used to ob -
tain cash for particular purposes. For example, 
50% of the surveyed users in 2011 stated that 
they had a special reason for making a cash 
withdrawal at a counter. The most frequently 
cited reasons are major purchases, craftsmen’s 
invoices and holidays, ie occasions that entail 
comparatively large expenditure.6 Of all three 
withdrawal options, POS shows the lowest 
average amount and, at only €105, is well 
 behind the figure for counter and ATM with -
drawals.
The low frequency of use and the small amount 
withdrawn already point to the fact that POS 
withdrawals still play no more than a minor 
role in Germany at present. In order to quantify 
their actual significance, the percentage values 
of POS, ATM and counter withdrawals are to 
be finally calculated for an average user.7 It 
 becomes apparent that the ATM with an aver -
age share of 80% is the dominant point of 
withdrawal. The share of counter withdrawals 
is much smaller at around 19%. As expected, 
POS withdrawals occupy last place. Their share 
of an average consumer’s total withdrawals 
amounts to only 1%.Average amount

6 The stated figures are average values for the individual 
users. Combining the surveyed microdata on amounts withdrawn and frequencies of withdrawal and, instead, calculating the average values for the transactions con -
ducted in 2011 produces an average figure of €163 at the 
ATM and an average figure of €306 at the counter. The 
figure for the ATM is consistent with the commercial banks’ data in the official statistics (€161). The counter figure, on the other hand, is distinctly higher in the official statistics at 
€1,178 per withdrawal transaction. This suggests that those surveyed for the payment behaviour study did not 
mention their extremely high-  v alue withdrawals, say, for 
hoarding purposes. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2013), Pay -
ment and securities settlement statistics in Germany 2008-2012.7 To do this, for each survey respondent the value of yearly withdrawals is calculated separately for ATM, counter and POS as the product of the average amount withdrawn and 
the frequency of withdrawal. These variables are then ex -
pressed as a ratio of the survey respondent’s total with -
drawals. In a final step, the three percentages are averaged over all respondents.Deutsche Bundesbank

Cash withdrawals at the 
point of sale: motives
Subjective assessment of the survey respondents
In the 2011 study on payment behaviour, users 
of POS withdrawals were asked why they used 
this procedure. Those who do not make POS 
withdrawals were asked to state their reasons 
for not doing so. Those surveyed were pre -
sented with a series of suggested answers. It 
was also possible, however, to give an alterna -
tive individual answer to the question. The se -
lection of suggested reasons was based on the 
system’s advantages and drawbacks as out -
lined above.
The chart below shows the distribution of the 
most frequently stated reasons for making POS 
withdrawals. Roughly 71% of users withdraw 
cash at the checkout when they have forgotten to obtain cash elsewhere. Convenience, speed and lack of charges are cited as a key factor by 
around one-  th ird of users in each case. Only 
4% state that they use the POS as a point of withdrawal because they have no other suit -
able  option available to them. These r esponses 
suggest that the key advantages of POS with -
drawals –  convenience, speed and lack of 
charges – do indeed play a part in the decision whether to use it. Nevertheless, the majority of users do not see POS as a primary withdrawal 
option, but as an alternative that can be used 
in an emergency.
The chart on page  75 shows the most fre -
quently cited reasons for not using POS with -
drawals. Roughly one-  thir d of the surveyed 
non- users do not see any need to make a POS 
cash withdrawal, since the closely-  knit network 
of ATMs and banks in Germany is sufficient. 
Furthermore, in matters pertaining to cash al -
most one-  quarter of non-  users trust solely their 
own bank and not retailers. A lack of aware -
ness of the possibility of withdrawing cash at 
the supermarket or at a filling station is in third place among the cited responses. Of the survey 
respondents, 13% stated that they make pur -
chases only in retail outlets where POS with -
drawals are not possible. Only 1.7% of those 
surveyed give the poor quality of the paid-  out 
banknotes as their reason.
Institutional determinants
The cited reasons show, on the one hand, that 
POS withdrawals are only a low-  priority alter -
native to ATMs and bank counters. On the 
other hand, it can be concluded from the re -
sponses that POS withdrawals at supermarket Reasons for

and filling station checkouts can be a practical 
solution for a small group of persons who 
otherwise have poor access to cash withdrawal 
facilities. How far institutional factors actually 
play a part in deciding which option to use can 
be determined using a simple regression analy-sis. For persons holding a current account at a bank with a thinly spread network of ATMs and 
persons living in rural areas there should, all 
other things being equal, be a higher probabil -
ity of withdrawing cash when going shopping.
In the following probit regression, the probabil -
ity of a person making a POS withdrawal at 
least once a year is modelled as a function of 
bank affiliation (the bank with which he or she 
holds an account), the size of the locality (city, 
town etc) where he or she lives, and other socio -
demographic factors.8 The chart on page 77 
shows the most important findings of the re-
gression analysis. The full results can be found in the table on page 78.In actual fact, an individual’s alternative with-
drawal options appear to be an important fac -
tor in the decision on use. At around 6%, cus -
tomers of savings banks and People’s banks and Raiffeisen banks 
(Volksbanken and Raiff -
eisenbanken) who can withdraw cash in many 
locations owing to their dense networks of ATMs are, all other things being equal, the least likely on average to make a POS with -
drawal. By contrast, customers of direct banks 
are the most likely to do so at around 17%. When comparing places where people live, 
persons living in localities with less than 2,000 
inhabitants are, all other things being equal, the most likely to make POS withdrawals at 
roughly 20%. Persons living in urban areas with 
100,000 to 500,000 inhabitants are the least 
likely to do so at around 5%.Regression

Cash withdrawals at the 
point of sale: implications for cash holding
Finally, we intend to study how the availability 
of POS withdrawals impacts on consumers’ 
cash holding habits. Of particular interest is 
whether, given more intensive use of this pro -
cedure, amounts of cash held for transaction 
purposes in Germany might fall.
Consumers who would like to pay for their pur -
chases in cash have to decide how much they 
keep for this purpose in their purse or wallet. In 
economic theory, the optimum amount de -
pends on three factors: first, the value of the transactions to be paid in cash; second, the 
costs that arise from holding cash (for example, 
forgone interest income or loss of cash due to theft); third, the costs that arise from the 
 replacement of cash (for example, withdrawal 
charges or the time and costs of getting to the 
place of withdrawal). Replacement costs are 
 reduced for consumers by the option of POS 
cash withdrawals. First, additional charge-  fr ee 
withdrawal options are  cr eated, which are 
 especially advantageous for persons holding a 
current account at banks with a thinly spread 
ATM network. Second, the processes of pay-
ment and withdrawal take place virtually simul -
taneously, which additionally saves time. Bau -
mol (1952) and Tobin (1956) showed that, 
given lower replacement costs, it is optimal for consumers to withdraw cash more often but in smaller amounts.
9 For a consumer with a given 
cash transaction volume and given costs of cash holding, the use of POS withdrawals should therefore lead to a reduction in the average amount of cash held for transaction 
purposes.Economic theoryDescriptive statistics on the variables in

Apart from the lowering of replacement costs, 
however, there is also a simple technical reason 
why less cash might be held. At many super -
markets, the withdrawal amount is limited to 
€200. This could prompt consumers who make 
POS withdrawals to withdraw and hold less 
cash.
In order to examine the connection between POS withdrawals and the average amount of 
cash held for transaction purposes, a microeco-nomic money demand function is estimated.
10 
To do this, a linear regression is performed. The 
dependent variable is the average amount of 
cash a person holds for transaction purposes. 
The key explanatory variable is the percentage 
of POS withdrawals in a person’s total annual 
withdrawals of cash. As further explanatory 
variables, the model contains the annual total 
volume of withdrawals, the percentage of card 
payments in weekly overall expenditure, bank 
affiliation, the size of the locality where he or 
she lives, age, the highest educational qualifi -
cation, income and the individual’s gender.11
Before the estimation, the average amount of 
cash held for transaction purposes as well as the POS withdrawals as a percentage of all 
cash withdrawals first has to be calculated. To calculate the amount of cash held for transac -
tion purposes, it is assumed for the sake of sim -plicity that an amount of cash withdrawn at a 
given time from an ATM, a counter or from a 
POS has been spent in regular and equal 
amounts by the time of the next withdrawal. If that is the case, at any given time an individual 
holds, on average, one-  half of the amounts he 
or she regularly withdraws in his or her wallet 
or purse.12 The amount of cash that an individ-
ual usually still has in his or her wallet or purse 
when he or she makes a new withdrawal of 
cash has to be added to this. This basic amount of money is always in his or her possession and Regression

* Projected probabilities are the outcome of a probit regression using “Individual carries out at least one POS withdrawal per year” as 
the dependent variable (0/1).

11 Descriptive statistics on these explanatory factors are 
shown in the table on page 78.12 The assumption that cash is spent in regular and equal 
amounts is plausible for withdrawals made to cover the 
usual needs for cash. If, on the other hand, cash is with -
drawn for special purposes, such as buying a second-  hand 
car, this assumption is problematic since it can be assumed 
that the cash will be spent soon afterwards. In this case, 
the assumption that cash is spent in regular and equal amounts would result in the estimated amount of cash 
used for transaction purposes being overstated.Deutsche Bundesbank

therefore has to be assigned entirely to the 
amount of cash held for transaction purposes.13
Based on the calculation method described 
above, the upper chart on page 79 shows the 
distribution of the average amount of cash 
held by the survey respondents for transaction 
purposes as a histogram. On average, an indi -
vidual holds about €153 in cash. The amounts 
range between €7.50 and €1,800, with 95% of 
individuals holding less than €400.
The share of POS withdrawals in relation to the 
survey respondents’ annual withdrawals has 
 already been determined in the calculations 
above (see also footnote 8). As mentioned earl-
ier, only around 8% of the survey respondents use the POS as a withdrawal location, thus pro -
ducing a zero share of use for 92% of the 
 respondents. On average, an individual makes 
only 1% of his or her withdrawals at the POS. 
For the group of POS users, the centre chart on page 79 shows as a histogram the distribution of POS as percentages of total withdrawals. In-dividuals making POS withdrawals obtain 12% 
of their cash reserves in this way on average. Nevertheless, for 95% of these persons, the 
share of POS withdrawals is only 2% (or less).
The lower chart on page 79 shows the most 
important results of the regression analysis. The full estimation results are shown in the table on 
page 80. The hypothesis of a negative correl -
ation between the extent to which POS with -
drawals are used and the average amount of 
cash held for transaction purposes is confirmed: the higher the percentage of POS withdrawals Regression analysis of the motives for

* Number of persons: 2,068. The table shows the results of two probit regressions with “Individual carries out at least one POS withdrawal per year” (0/ 1) as the dependent variable. Column two shows the marginal effect on the decision on use for each characteristic under observation. In the case of cardinally scaled variables (eg age), this measures the extent to which the prob-ability of making a POS withdrawal changes when the explana-tory variable under consideration is increased by one unit. In the 
case of non- cardinally scaled variables (eg “Individual has a  senior school leaving certifi  cate”) the marginal effect shows by 
how much the probability of use increases if the individual in question has the characteristic under consideration. Further-more, column 3 shows robust standard errors, which, in com-bination with the marginal effects, allow conclusions to be drawn as to the statistical accuracy of the estimation. ***, **, * denote statistical signifi  cance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level.
Deutsche Bundesbank13 Specifically, the following calculation formula is used for 
the amount of cash held for transaction purposes (German: 
Transaktionskasse, TK).
 . Here, fj denotes how many times
 a year an individual withdraws cash from an ATM ( j=1), a 
counter (j= 2) and from a POS ( j=3). bj denotes the  r ele-
 vant amount that is usually withdrawn. Thus, 
 is the average amount withdrawn by an individual over all three withdrawal options, half of which he or she holds in his or her wallet or purse. If the basic amount of money r 
is added, this gives us the average amount of cash held by 
an individual for transaction purposes.Deutsche Bundesbank

is, the smaller the average amount of cash held 
for transaction purposes. This correlation is 
statistically significant. From a macroeconomic 
perspective, however, the estimated effects are 
slight. Increasing the intensity of use by 1 per -
centage point would, all other things being 
equal, lower the amount of cash an individual 
holds for transaction purposes by 52 cents. 
Even with a tenfold increase in the intensity of 
use from 1% at present to 10%, the average 
amount of cash held for transaction purposes 
would decline only from €153 at present to 
roughly €149, which is equivalent to a percent -
age change of about 3%. If consumers 
switched over completely to POS withdrawals, 
the average amount of cash held for transac -
tion purposes would go down to about €97, which corresponds to a roughly 37% reduc -
tion.14
Summary and conclusions
In conclusion, it may be noted that awareness 
and utilisation of POS withdrawals are still at 
very low levels in Germany. For consumers, 
withdrawing cash from an ATM remains the 
norm. The POS withdrawal facility is used only 
if an individual has forgotten to withdraw cash 
from an ATM or if circumstances make it diffi -
cult to do so. Persons who have tended to have 
poor access to cash in the past appear to bene -
fit from this facility, however. A significantly 
higher probability of use is shown by customers of banks with a thinly spread ATM network as 
well as by individuals living in what tend to be 
more rural areas.
POS withdrawals have had only minor effects on consumers’ cash holding so far. Although 
there is a statistically significant correlation be -
tween the intensity of use and the amount of POS withdrawals 
only a stopgap, but a good 
 
alternative for 
individuals who otherwise have poor access to cash

14 The regression results should nevertheless be viewed as 
an indication – not as proof – of a decline. Problems might 
arise if users and non-  users of POS withdr awals differ fun -
damentally in their cash holding habits and these differ -
ences cannot be captured adequately using the explana -
tory factors of the model.Deutsche Bundesbank

cash held for transaction purposes, it is quanti-
tatively very small and – in combination with 
the low intensity of use  – negligible from a 
macroeconomic perspective.
It remains to be seen whether POS withdrawals 
will play a significant role in supplying cash to 
consumers in the future. Their increasing im -
portance is suggested by the growing number 
of providers who are also promoting this facil -
ity more and more strongly. Furthermore, the 
growing trend for card payments among con -
sumers is consistent with a move towards de -
mand for this facility. In countries such as the 
United Kingdom and Australia where cashless 
payments are much more common, there is 
also more widespread use of POS withdrawals, 
for example. What argues against growing use 
of this facility is the fact that many users see 
this procedure only as a second-  class alterna -
tive to the ATM and bank counter. The crucial 
matter is whether the system’s key advantage 
– saving time – will be enough to make people 
switch from their longstanding routine practice 
of withdrawing cash from an ATM or at a 
counter.Regression analysis of the impact of POS
