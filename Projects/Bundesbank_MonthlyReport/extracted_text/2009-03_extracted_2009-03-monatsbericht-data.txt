5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
Overall output in Germany is being increas-
ingly affected by the severe downturn in the
global economy. Real gross domestic product
(GDP) had already fallen by 2.1% after sea-
sonal and calendar adjustment in the final
quarter of last year. This followed a decline of
0.5% in both the second and third quarters.
First, manufacturing, which had previously
benefited to a particular extent from the
favourable economic setting, cut back its pro-
duction dramatically in the wake of waning
demand at home and abroad. Second, the
services sector was affected almost immedi-
ately, too. Moreover, the underlying reces-
sionary trend is revealed by the fact that over-
all capacity is now considerably underutilised,
with the labour market already having passed
the turning-point in the cycle.
The sharp downturn in business activity,
which is occurring almost simultaneously in
all the major regions of the world economy,
led to a severe 71/C252% decline in exports of
goods and services as soon as the fourth
quarter of 2008. Given the ongoing down-
ward slide in export orders, there was no
change in this trend at the beginning of this
year; in seasonally adjusted terms, nominal
exports of goods in January 2009 were 4.4%
down on December 2008. However, nominal
imports of goods in the reporting period were
no more than 0.8% down on the month. The
trade surplus, at 381/C254billion after seasonal
adjustment, showed a further decline in
January.Major

6Industry
The recessionary trend in industry became
even more severe at the start of this year. In
January, seasonally adjusted industrial output
slumped by 8.4% on the month, which fol-
lowed earlier marked output losses in the
fourth quarter of 2008.1One factor in this
context is that, in response to the persistent
sluggish demand, many firms extended their
works holidays well into January. Output was
more than one-fifth down on the year. In a
cross-sector comparison, manufacturers of
intermediate goods made the largest overall
cutback in production in the final quarter of
2008. The capital goods sector has since
followed the same course, however. There
has been a very obvious cutback in produc-
tion in the mechanical engineering sector and
in the manufacture of computing, electrical
and optical equipment. The decline in motor
vehicle production was less marked than be-
fore, however.
The sharp downturn in industrial orders con-
tinued unabated. In January, the seasonally
adjusted volume of orders fell by 8.0% on
the month – a decline of 7.6% having already
been registered in December. There was a dis-
tinct fall in new orders especially from non-
euro-area countries at the beginning of the
year. By contrast, following a very sharp
decline in the previous months, there was noEconomic conditions in Germany*

Deutsche Bundesbank1For the reporting month of January 2009, major short-
term business statistics were rebased on the Statistical
Classification of Economic Activities in the European
Community NACE Rev. 2. At the same time, there was a
changeover in the indices to the new base year 2005.
The statistics affected by this were back-calculated for
several years. Nevertheless, the figures under the new
classification may differ from the data published earlier.Output

7more than a slight fall in demand from the
euro area. A major part in this was played byspecial factors stemming from the manufac-ture of other transport equipment – a sectorthat is especially volatile. The decline in do-mestic orders was likewise less pronouncedthan in the preceding months.
ConstructionConstruction output fell by a seasonally
adjusted 7.8% at the beginning of 2009,following an increase of 5.9% in Decemberof last year. Construction activity in January islikely to have been restricted by the compara-tively cold winter weather. Nevertheless, thelow level of output also reflects the fact thatthe last three months of 2008 showed amarked seasonally adjusted decline in newconstruction orders compared with the thirdquarter (-7.7%).
Labour marketThe sharp economic downturn is increasingly
making itself felt in the labour market. In sea-sonally adjusted terms, 83,000 fewer personswere in work in January than in December,which represents a 0.2% fall. This means thatthe employment figure was only 110,000, or0.3%, higher than in the same month of2007. According to initial estimates by theFederal Employment Agency, there was amonth-on-month rise in the number ofpersons in employment subject to socialsecurity contributions of 9,000 in December2008, which means that there was hardly anyseasonally adjusted increase. Furthermore,during the final quarter of last year there wasa considerable increase in the number of per-
sons on short-time work. While, in Septem-ber, only 50,000 persons were temporarilyemployed for fewer than their standardworking hours, the figure was 270,000 in De-cember. This represents an increase of193,000 on the year. Firms continued to re-port short-time working in a growing numberof cases. According to the provisional data ofthe Federal Employment Agency, the totalnumber of persons who were affected by thisrose to 724,000 in February, which wassomewhat more than twice as high as inJanuary.
Despite extensive recourse to short-time work-
ing, there was a further significant seasonallyadjusted increase of 40,000 in the unemploy-ment figure to 3.31 million in February. Theunemployment rate was 7.9%, comparedwith 7.8% in January. The figure was 66,000lower than in the same period last year.
PricesIn the international crude oil markets, the
price of a barrel of Brent crude oil continuedto fluctuate within a range of about US$40to US$50 which had emerged at the begin-ning of the year owing to marked cutbacks inproduction and weak worldwide demand.During the first three weeks of March, spotprices were trending upwards slightly, reach-ing US$49
3/C254as this report went to press. Dur-
ing this period, the expectation of rising oilprices was gaining ground again somewhatin the futures markets. At the end of theperiod under review, a premium of US$5

US$123/C254.
The prices of domestically produced industrial
goods fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.2% be-
tween December 2008 and February 2009.
This fall was due mainly to a further reduction
in the prices of energy and other inputs.
Non-durable goods also became significantly
cheaper. Overall, the year-on-year rate
showed a further perceptible fall at 0.9% in
February. If energy is excluded, the figure was
-0.7%.
The moderate rise in consumer prices con-
tinued in February with a seasonally adjusted
month-on-month increase of 0.2%. This was
due, above all, to price rises in the case of in-
dustrial goods and a further increase in fuel
prices. Food prices remained unchanged on
average in February, however. Increases in the
prices of vegetables were offset by price re-
ductions for other food items. The year-on-
year rate was 1.0% in both the national con-
sumer price index (CPI) and the Harmonised
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).
Public finances2
Statutory health insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance scheme re-
corded a surplus of just over 31/C252billion in
2008. This is likely to have completely elimin-
ated the health insurance institutions’ debts.
The surplus was approximately 31 billion
lower than in 2007. While revenue rose over-
all quite briskly by nearly 4%, expenditure in-creased at the even faster rate of over 41/C252%.
Employment growth and comparatively high
wage increases, but also another small rise in
the average contribution rate (to 14.9% com-
pared with 14.8% in 2007), pushed up rev-
enue from contributions by almost 4%. In-
come subject to compulsory insurance contri-
butions (basic wage total) grew by nearly
3%. At just under 31/C252%, the increase in basic
wages of employees insured in the statutory
health insurance scheme lagged behind that
in gross wages and salaries as defined in the
national accounts (+4%) because employ-
ment growth was offset by a fall in the num-
ber of persons out of work for whom health
insurance contributions likewise have to be
paid. The growth in pensions, which are also
subject to compulsory insurance contribu-
tions, was sluggish (+1%).
The statutory health insurance scheme’s ex-
penditure on benefits rose by just over 41/C252%
in 2008. However, the growth rate levelled
off from the second quarter and, at the end
of the year, stood at just over 4%. While
spending on pharmaceuticals increased at an
above-average pace of almost 51/C252%, this
rate, too, slowed during the course of the
year to just under 4% at last count. This was
probably due partly to the extension of fixed-
sum billing which came into effect as of 1 July
2008. 5% more was spent on out-patient
treatment. This clearly exceeded the increase
2In the short report on public finances which regularly
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly Reports
(published in February, May, August and November), by
contrast, contain a detailed description of general gov-
ernment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For

9in basic wages and is presumably partly at-
tributable to the expansion of extra-budgetary benefits (such as out-patient oper-ations). Although, at 3
1/C252%, expenditure on
hospital treatment grew at a below-averagerate, this was still much faster than in previ-ous years.
In the current year, the new arrangements for
out-patient doctors’ remuneration
3and add-
itional funding for hospitals4will lead to con-
siderable additional expenditure that exceedsthe underlying expenditure dynamics. To fi-nance this, the uniform contribution rate forthe new health insurance fund set up on1 January 2009 was fixed at 15.5%. As partof the second economic stimulus package, itwill be reduced back to 14.9% in mid-2009,however, and the revenue shortfall will beoffset by an increase of just over 33 billion in
transfers from the central governmentbudget. Due to the fact that the macroeco-nomic outlook has worsened considerablysince the uniform contribution rate was fixedon 1 November 2008, the health insurancefund will record lower contribution revenuethan expected in 2009. However, health in-surance fund payments to the health insur-ance institutions have already been deter-mined on the basis of estimated expenditure.The financing risk on the revenue side istherefore being borne exclusively by thehealth insurance fund or – if liquidity assist-ance has to be provided – ultimately by thecentral government budget. To avoid procy-clical effects, the repayment deadline for anyfinancial assistance that may be provided hasbeen extended by one year until the end of2011. By contrast, if spending rises fasterthan expected, the health insurance institu-
tions will have to demand an additional con-tribution from their members sooner. How-ever, this risk has been slightly mitigated bythe fact that the 2008 financial balance wasmore favourable than forecast in autumn lastyear. In 2010, additional contributions couldthen also be necessary if income subject to

3Owing to budgeting, the price of a benefit has general-
ly been determined up to now ex post. From 2009, remu-
neration rates will be determined ex ante, which means
that extensions of the range of benefits provided will
have a direct effect on the volume of expenditure. Spend-
ing growth is to be curbed by specifying standard benefit
volumes. If these are exceeded, the remuneration rates
are to be lowered progressively.
4Under the Hospital Financing Reform Act (Kranken-
hausfinanzierungsreformgesetz) , the health insurance in-
stitutions are to reimburse half of the rises in negotiated
wage increases for 2008 and 2009, in particular, to the
extent that these exceed the basic wage trend per mem-
ber. In addition, the discount of 0.5% granted to the
health insurance institutions has been scrapped. There
will also be additional expenditure to increase nursing
staff numbers and on psychiatric treatment and training.Financial risks in

Securities markets
Bond market
In January 2009, the issue volume in the Ger-
man bond market increased to 3182.9 billion
(gross issues in the previous month: 3173.1
billion). After deducting renewed high
redemptions ( 3175.4 billion) and taking
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of
their own bonds, in net terms, 33.0 billion
was returned to investors. At the same time,
German investors sold foreign debt instru-
ments for 30.1 billion net. Therefore, the
volume of debt securities in Germany out-
standing fell by 33.1 billion in January.
In January, the public sector was the most
active borrower, raising 313.0 billion in the
bond market. Central government increased
its capital market debt by 38.8 billion. It main-
ly issued Treasury discount paper ( 38.3 billion)
and two-year Federal Treasury notes ( 37.2 bil-
lion). It also issued 31.7 billion worth of
thirty-year Federal bonds (Bunds) and 30.5
billion worth of five-year Federal notes
(Bobls). These contrasted with redemptions
of ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds), Federal
savings notes and Federal Treasury financing
paper amounting to 38.9 billion, 30.2 billion
and30.1 billion respectively. The state gov-ernments raised 34.3 billion in new funds on
the capital markets.
German credit institutions reduced their cap-
ital market debt by 39.5 billion in January
(compared with a 344.2 billion reduction in
the previous month). They reduced the vol-
ume of public Pfandbriefe and mortgage
Pfandbriefe outstanding by 310.0 billion and
31.8 billion respectively. By contrast, special-
ised credit institutions issued securities for
31.9 billion net. In addition banks saw inflows
of30.3 billion net resulting from issues of
other bank debt securities which can be
structured flexibly.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital
market debt by 36.5 billion in January. They
had issued own debt securities for a net
amount of 338.9 billion in December. How-
ever, these were primarily in the form of
securitisations by special purpose vehicles
without a banking licence.
Foreign investors were the most significant
group of purchasers in the German bond
market in January. They purchased 32.8 bil-
lion worth of German instruments, which, in
net terms, consisted entirely of securities
issued by the public sector. In addition, Ger-
man non-banks purchased a small amount of
debt securities ( 30.8 billion). By contrast,
credit institutions reduced their bond hold-
ings by 36.7 billion.
Equity market
In January, German enterprises issued new
shares amounting to 34.1 billion (comparedSales of debt

11with 30.7 billion in the previous month).
Listed enterprises accounted for two-thirds of
this amount. The volume of foreign shares in
the German market increased by 32.4 billion.
Shares were primarily purchased by German
non-banks, which increased their equity hold-
ings by 319.2 billion. German credit institu-
tions likewise purchased equities, though to a
lesser extent ( 31.9 billion). By contrast, for-
eign investors scaled back their investments
in German stocks by 314.7 billion.
Mutual fund shares
In January, domestic mutual funds sold share
certificates for 311.2 billion in the German
market. This inflow of funds was largely even-
ly distributed between funds open to the
general public and specialised funds reserved
for institutional investors ( 35.7 billion and
35.5 billion respectively). Of the funds open
to the general public, equity-based funds
recorded inflows of 33.9 billion. Open-end
real estate funds, bond-based funds and
mixed securities funds sold own certificates
for30.8 billion, 30.5 billion and 30.4 billion
respectively. Other mixed funds also recorded
small inflows ( 30.3 billion). Money market
funds were the only group to record an out-
flow (amounting to 30.4 billion). In January,
foreign companies sold 32.6 billion worth of
shares in the German market (compared with
34.8 billion in the previous month). Mutual
fund shares were purchased almost exclusive-
ly by German non-banks ( 315.0 billion). In
addition, foreign investors purchased 30.4 bil-
lion worth of German mutual fund shares. By
contrast, German credit institutions sold mu-tual fund shares in net terms (amounting to
31.6 billion).
Balance of payments
In January 2009, Germany’s current account
was running an – unadjusted – surplus of
34.2 billion, down 38.5 billion on the month.
The reason for this was that invisible current
transactions, which comprise services, in-
come and current transfers, had shifted from
surplus to deficit. By contrast, the trade sur-
plus increased slightly.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in January the foreign
trade surplus was up by 31.2 billion on the
month to 38.5 billion. However, after adjust-Sales and purchases

12ment for seasonal and calendar variations, it
went down by 32.7 billion to 38.3 billion. The
value of exports declined more significantly
(by 4.4%) than that of imports (0.8 %). Com-
pared with the fourth-quarter average, sea-
sonally adjusted earnings from exports fell by
10.6 %. Imports declined by 6.0 %.
A deficit of 33.0 billion was recorded for in-
visible current transactions in January, com-
pared with a surplus of 36.5 billion in Decem-
ber. A deterioration in all three sub-accounts
contributed to this result. Services and current
transfers ran deficits of 31.5 billion and 34.3
billion respectively in January compared with
surpluses of 31.1 billion and 30.8 billion
respectively in the previous month. Net
receipts from cross-border factor income
decreased by 31.8 billion to 32.8 billion.
With respect to cross-border portfolio invest-
ment, January saw net capital exports in the
amount of 317.8 billion, which was broadly
unchanged on the month. This was attribut-
able mainly to reduced investment in Ger-
many by non-residents ( 313.5 billion) who,
as in previous years, took the opportunity
in January to dispose of shares ( 316.8 bil-
lion). By contrast, they invested in a modest
volume of debt securities ( 32.8 billion), albeit
while shedding bonds and notes ( 32.9 billion)
and acquiring money market paper ( 35.8 bil-
lion). Securities transactions by German in-
vestors likewise led to net capital outflows
(34.3 billion). They purchased mutual fund
shares ( 32.6 billion) and shares ( 31.8 billion)
abroad.Major items of the balance

13As in the case of portfolio investment, direct
investment also resulted in net capital exports(310.9 billion). These are primarily attribut-
able to investment by German enterprisesabroad ( 39.8 billion) which, in particular,
increased their equity capital investment intheir foreign affiliates ( 311.2 billion). This was
partially offset by inflows of funds arisingfrom intra-group credit transactions ( 34.5 bil-
lion). Transactions by foreign proprietors alsogenerated capital outflows ( 31.1 billion). In
this context, they withdrew funds ( 34.2 bil-
lion) from their branches domiciled inGermany by means of credit transactions,predominantly in the form of trade credits. Atthe same time, the boost in equity capital andreinvested earnings (combined total 33.1 bil-
lion) served per se to bolster their financial
strength.
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (wherethese are not part of direct investment) as
well as bank deposits and other assets sawnet capital imports of 350.8 billion in January.
Non-banks recorded inflows of 37.8 billion.
These were almost entirely the result of oper-ations by general government ( 37.7 billion),
which took up short-term loans abroad andadditionally reduced their bank deposits out-side Germany. The banking system also re-corded inflows of funds ( 342.9 billion net).
These arose largely from unsecuritised foreigntransactions by credit institutions, leading tocapital imports to the amount of 369.7 bil-
lion. By contrast, there were outflows offunds through Bundesbank accounts in theamount of 326.8 billion. Just under two-
thirds of this amount were due to an increasein claims within the TARGET2 large-value pay-ment system.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets declined – at
transaction values – by 32.2 billion in January.Direct

15German balance of
payments in 2008The external economic conditions for
the German economy deteriorated se-
verely in the course of 2008. Although,
following a good start to the year, ex-
ports remained at a very high level
until the start of the fourth quarter,
they plummeted thereafter. This was
the result of the very sharp and global-
ly synchronous economic slowdown,
which mainly affected industrial goods,
a key market for German exports. The
terms of trade also developed un-
favourably in the course of the year
owing to commodity prices. Overall,
the trade surplus contracted noticeably
in 2008. The current account surplus
fell by a similar margin. This was
roughly counterbalanced by corres-
ponding net capital outflows. Capital
flows to and from Germany last year
were primarily influenced by the escal-
ating financial crisis, which led to a
sharp fall in cross-border financial
transactions in general and, in some
cases, in asset positions, too. As a re-
sult, money flowed out of Germany in
2008 on a large scale, mainly in the
form of direct investment, but also as
lending. By contrast, net capital in-
flows were recorded in portfolio in-
vestment.

16increasingly confronted by dampening effects
in the second half of the year. These became
paramount in the fourth quarter, when the
financial crisis escalated considerably and
spilled over to the group of emerging market
economies. All of Germany’s key sales regions
were affected by the global economy’s steep
slide in the fourth quarter, especially markets
in industrialised countries, the new EU mem-
ber states and the Russian Federation. An
additional handicap for German exporters
was that demand for capital goods, which
traditionally feature prominently in Germany’s
foreign trade, recently dropped off drastically
in line with the customary cyclical pattern
after having expanded extremely dynamically
in the previous years. Towards the end of the
year, the global economic outlook in general,
and that for German exporters in particular,
was gloomier than it had been for some time.
Averaging 31/C254% in 2008, worldwide output
grew at a noticeably slower rate than in
2007, when it rose by 51/C254%. The global trade
volume also grew significantly more slowly,
with the growth rate falling from 71/C254%t o
4%. The sales markets for German exporters
were disproportionately affected by this; at
23/C254%, they grew more slowly than at any
time since the global downturn of 2001-02.
In the first three quarters of 2008, global eco-
nomic momentum was perceptibly dented in
addition by the sharp rise in commodity prices
and the resulting loss of purchasing power in
consumer countries. Although the prices of
crude oil and major industrial and agricultural
commodities fell sharply again in the second
half of the year, they were nonetheless well
above those in 2007 on an annual average.Furthermore, the German economy suffered
heavily for a time from the euro’s appreciation
against major currencies, which persisted
until mid-2008. Exchange rate movements
consequently led to a significant drop in price
competitiveness, especially in markets outside
the euro area. On an annual average, how-
ever, price competitiveness was still 33/C254%
above its multi-year average.1
Export orders had already reached their cyclic-
al peak in the last quarter of 2007 and first
quarter of 2008. Thereafter, they first de-
creased moderately, then more sharply in late
summer 2008. As a result, their annual aver-
age level was 71/C252% below that in 2007. Sen-
timent among German exporters likewise
deteriorated dramatically in the second half
of 2008. By the end of the year, expectations
regarding the outlook for exports had fallen
to their lowest levels since the early 1970s.
After German exporters had worked their
way through the comparatively large export
backlog by the third quarter, exports declined
sharply in the fourth quarter, falling 81/C252%
under the first-quarter high in seasonally ad-
justed terms. On an annual average, nominal
exports of goods nonetheless rose by 23/C254%,
compared with growth of +131/C252% and +8%
in the two previous years. Prices of exported
goods increased significantly until late sum-
mer – not least because of the hike in energy
and commodity prices – before falling percep-
tibly again in the fourth quarter, partly owing
to falling external demand. On average in
2008, export prices increased by 2% on
2007. Real export growth amounted to just

173/C254% and thus fell well short of the pace of ex-
pansion of world trade.
Germany’s modest export surplus was sup-
ported, above all, by exports to non-euro-area countries, particularly emerging marketeconomies, which, until the summer, hadlargely managed to avoid being draggeddown by the global economic downturn. Ex-ports to countries outside the euro area in-creased by a nominal 4
1/C252% and, in real
terms, by 23/C254% compared with 2007. As its
price competitiveness dropped on an annualaverage owing to the appreciation of theeuro, however, the German economy lostmarket shares in non-euro-area countries.Germany’s export performance outside theeuro area also differed across countries. Thehighest export growth was achieved in theOPEC countries (+19
1/C252%) and the Russian
Federation (+143/C254%), where demand for Ger-
man goods was fuelled by the further hike inrevenue from oil and gas sales until the sum-mer. Exports to China also climbed at the ex-ceptional rate of 14% owing inter alia to a
substantial increase in demand for machineryand equipment in the wake of capacitybottlenecks. By contrast, exports to theSouth-East Asian emerging market econ-omies increased at a below-average rate(+1%). The export earnings of German enter-prises in the new EU member states rose fast-er than average (+6
3/C254%), spearheaded by ex-
ports to Poland (+11%). The momentum ofexports to this region almost halved com-pared to 2007, however, owing to the sharpeconomic downturn.In 2008 German enterprises once again re-
corded sales losses in the United States. At2
1/C252%, however, the year-on-year fall was
much smaller than in 2007. This may havebeen helped by the fact that German export-ers’ price competitiveness vis-/C224-vis domesticUS suppliers as well as suppliers from thirdcountries was eroded less than in 2007. Thismay, in turn, relate to the euro’s depreciationagainst the US dollar which began in summerSelected indicators of the

US dollar, which was an extra hurdle for Jap-
anese suppliers wishing to trade in the USA.
US demand for German automobiles plum-
meted, while exports of machinery and
chemical products held up relatively well (see
box on page 20). German exports to Japan
also fell, declining by 13/C254% on average in
2008. This was essentially the result of the
drop in real domestic demand.
German exports of goods to other euro-area
countries also slowed considerably following
the onset of the economic slump in these
countries from the middle of the year. On an
annual average, their value increased by just
11/C254% and thus perceptibly less than exports
to countries outside the euro area; in real
terms, they were actually negative for the
first time since 1993. The negative macroeco-
nomic influences were so strong that they
clearly outweighed the ongoing improvement
of the German economy’s price competitive-
ness vis-/C224-vis other euro-area countries. Ex-
ports to countries that were affected early on
by the impact of the financial market crisis
– namely Ireland and Spain – fell particularly
sharply. By contrast, the German export sec-
tor again significantly increased its supplies to
France, its most important euro-area sales
market (+53/C254%). However, deliveries of Ger-
man cars to France fell, which may be partly
attributable to the introduction of an environ-
mental tax with supplements and discounts
for promoting the sale of fuel-efficient cars.
German manufacturers, most of which be-
long to the upper market segment, are at a
structural disadvantage in this regard.Structure and development of

19Broken down by industry, the slowdown in
the German export sector reveals a differenti-ated picture.
2Producers of capital goods,
which account for 421/C252% of all goods export-
ed from Germany, were most affected for theabove-mentioned reasons. Within this cat-egory, manufacturers of machinery managedto raise their export revenues by 3
1/C252%. Con-
versely, the automobile industry recorded a5
1/C252% drop in sales abroad. The information
and communications technology (ICT) sectorlikewise registered a sharp fall in goods ex-ports (-9
1/C254%). The decrease was, however,
probably slightly smaller in real terms as pricesof these goods fell again.
Exporters of intermediate goods also fell prey
to the global economic downturn. The valueof exported intermediate goods, which ac-count for almost one-third of German ex-ports, was
1/C252% lower in 2008 than a year
earlier. German producers only managed topartly pass on the considerable price hikes af-fecting industrial raw materials and crude oil,which play a significant role in the manufac-ture of intermediate goods, to their custom-ers at home and abroad. Looking through therange of intermediate goods, nominal exportsof chemical products rose sharply; however,three-quarters of this increase was price-related. In this case, the rise in export priceswas driven mainly by higher energy prices. Bycontrast, export revenue generated from thesale of metals and metal products fell by1
1/C254% – and even more in real terms. The
value of exported consumer goods, on theother hand, continued to grow at a relativelyfast pace (4
1/C252%).The nominal value of imported goods rose by
53/C254% in 2008 and thus considerably more
steeply than exports. In real terms, however,they went up by only
1/C252%. Import growth
was dampened, in particular, by the weakermomentum of exports, the production ofwhich entails a large share of imported in-puts. The sharp rise in the price of imports(+5
1/C254%) was attributable chiefly to the hike
in the prices of oil and natural gas as well asfood, beverages and tobacco up to mid-2008. Since then, world market prices forthese goods have, however, fallen consider-ably in the wake of the global economicdownturn. On an annual average, the priceForeign trade by selected

The automotive in dustry was Germany’s lea ding export 
sector in 2008, a ccountin g for a share of 17½%, followe d 
by ma chinery (14¾%) an d the chemi cal in dustry (14%). In 
the followin g, export developments in these three se ctors 
of in dustry will be examine d in more detail, differentiate d 
by country of destination an d sales re gion. 
Euro-area tra ding partners were by far the most important 
customers of German exporters in ea ch of these in dustries. 
However, the ma chinery se ctor re corded a far lower export 
ratio to euro-area countries (30¼%) than did motor vehi cles 
and motor vehi cle parts (37¼%) an d chemi cals (4 6¼%). EU 
mem ber states outsi de the euro area were the se con d most 
important export destination. These countries represente d a 
consi dera bly hi gher per centa ge of Germany‘s motor vehi cle 
exports, namely 24%, than of ma chinery (18½%) an d chem-
icals (1 6¼%). In terms of ma chinery deliveries, customers in 
Asia ( deﬁ ne d here as the South-East Asian emer ging market 
economies in cluding Japan an d China) have, in re cent years, 
move d up to thir d pla ce with an export share of 13¼%, 
followe d by the oil an d gas-exportin g nations (Russia an d  
OPE C) with 10% an d the Unite d States with 8½%. In terms 
of exports of chemi cals an d motor vehi cles, the Unite d States 
(export share 8¾% an d 11¼% respe ctively) remaine d ahea d 
of both Asia (8½% an d 7% respe ctively) an d of Russia an d 
the OPE C countries (to gether 4¾% an d 6% respe ctively). Overall, the value of exporte d chemi cals expan ded by a 
fairly stron g +6½% in 2008 in a year-on-year comparison. 
German manufa cturers of ma chinery were also a ble to per-
cepti bly raise their forei gn sales as the or ders situation was 
initially still comparatively goo d (+3½%). By contrast, export 
revenues in the automotive in dustry fell sharply (-5½%). It 
is strikin g that, in terms of exports to the EU an d the U SA, 
of the three cate gories of goo ds only chemi cals re gistere d 
gains, while exports of ma chinery were alrea dy sli ghtly 
lower an d motor vehi cle exports fell sharply, espe cially in 
the se con d half of the year. 
Differen ces between the various cate gories of goo ds were 
most pronoun ced for exports to the Unite d States, with 
chemi cals up (+22¾%), ma chinery down sli ghtly (-2¼%) an d 
motor vehi cles sharply lower (-13½%). The relatively lar ge 
volume of automo bile exports to the Unite d States meant 
that this one country a ccounte d for just un der a thir d of 
all the German car in dustry’s export shortfall. Followin g 
a mo derate decline in the ﬁ  rst half of the year, deliveries 
plummete d by aroun d 25% in the se con d half. However, 
the drop in sales to the Unite d States hit not only German 
manufa cturers – domesti c bran ds were even worse affe cted. 
Overall, unit sales of li ght vehi cles (passen ger cars an d vans) 
fell by 18% last year. In this sharply contra ctin g market, Ger-
man manufa cturers were a ble to limit their sales losses to 
6%. Their market share consequently a ctually rose sli ghtly, 
by 1 per centa ge point to just a bove 6½%, while their share 
of the passen ger car business in 2008 amounte d to as mu ch 
as 10½%. There are various reasons for the collapse of the 
US auto market. On the one han d, the hefty in crease in 
fuel pri ces in the ﬁ  rst half of the year noti ceably dente d 
consumers‘ propensity to pur chase, parti cularly cars with a 
high fuel consumption. On the other han d, sales were also 
curbed by the re cessionary development whi ch set in at 
the en d of 2007 an d the in creasin gly ti ght credit stan dards 
whi ch resulte d from the ﬁ  nan cial crisis. Even before that, 
US automo bile manufa cturers ha d resorte d to re bates in an 
attempt to sta bilise sales. German car exporters a ddition-
ally ha d to conten d with the euro‘s appre ciation up until 
the thir d quarter of 2008. One of the main reasons for the 
stron g growth in the German chemi cal in dustry’s U S business 
was the marke d increase in exports of basi c pharma ceuti cal 
pro ducts. Like ﬁ  nal pharma ceuti cal pro ducts, these are far 
less su bject to cyclical fa ctors than other chemi cal pro ducts 
and accounte d for 47½% of total chemi cal exports to the 
Unite d States at the last count.

21was in turn supporte d by pharma ceuti cal pro ducts. Exports 
of these pro ducts to the euro area expan ded mu ch less than 
those to other EU mem ber states. However, as pharma ceut-
ical pro ducts’ share of chemi cals exports (17¾%) is rou ghly 
four times lar ger for exports to the euro area than to the 
other EU countries, the euro-area mem ber states neverthe-
less ma de twi ce as lar ge a contri bution to the in dustry’s 
export performan ce. In a ddition, the chemi cal in dustry’s 
export revenues were buoye d by hi gher fertiliser sales. 
Moreover, consi dera bly more pesti cides were exporte d to 
the other EU countries than a year earlier.
By contrast, German exports of motor vehi cles to the euro 
area an d the other EU countries fell sharply, by 10% an d 
8% respe ctively. In the euro-area countries, deman d for 
automo biles weakene d per cepti bly as early as the ﬁ  rst half 
of the year, while the other EU countries were not hit by 
the in dustry‘s cyclical downturn until the thir d quarter. 
However, in this sales re gion, exports of motor vehi cles fell 
even more sharply in the ﬁ  nal quarter of the year, down 
32½%, than did deliveries to the euro area (-23%). This can 
lar gely be explaine d by the fa ct that the UK car market, 
whi ch ha d absor bed 11% of German automotive exports in 
2007, shrank by 11¼% – as measure d by re gistrations – as 
the consi dera ble e conomi c slow down an d growin g ﬁ nan-
cing constraints starte d to bite. This alone lowere d German 
exports of motor vehi cles an d motor vehi cle parts by 1½%.
Exports to Russia an d the OPE C countries as well as the Asian 
region fare d mu ch better than the three se ctors’ sales to 
the in dustrialise d countries. Here, avera ge growth rates for 
the year were lar gely still in dou ble digits. In these re gions, 
exports of ma chinery expan ded so stron gly that the, on an 
annual avera ge, comparatively mo derate drop in deman d 
on the European sales markets an d in the U SA was more 
than offset. Exports of ma chinery to China, whi ch rose by 
a total of 17½%, were a major contri butory fa ctor in this. 
In a ddition, business with Russia (+20½%) an d the OPE C 
countries (+14½%) expan ded sharply. In these sales re gions, 
deman d was parti cularly stron g for, inter alia , internal

+25½%, China +1 6¾%, Russia +1 6%), althou gh the dynami c 
momentum of 2007 was not maintaine d. However, these

22of Brent crude oil denominated in euro none-
theless rose by 25% and other commodities
by 41/C252%. The import prices of goods with
less production depth (raw materials and
semi-finished goods) therefore soared in
2008, while the price of imported finished
goods remained unchanged. Overall, Germa-
ny’s terms of trade deteriorated by 23/C254%i n
the period under review. This decline, which
was largely caused by energy prices, caused
significant real income losses for German
consumers but triggered barely any substitu-
tion effects as demand for imported energy is
very inelastic to price changes in the short
term.
In terms of value, imports of energy expand-
ed particularly rapidly (+36%) in 2008. Three-
quarters of this increase was, however, price-
related. The associated loss of purchasing
power in Germany amounted to 3161/C254billion
or 0.7% of nominal GDP compared with
0.1% in 2007. Conversely, the value of im-
ported intermediate goods fell significantly in
2008 (-3%). This was due to the fact that im-
ports of metal and metal products fell 41/C254%
short of their 2007 level in nominal terms;
price reductions accounted for two-fifths of
this drop. Foreign manufacturers of chemical
products sold 2% more of their goods in Ger-
many; on a price-adjusted basis, however,
their sales decreased.
The value of imported capital goods fell by
41/C252%. This overstates the decline in invest-
ment activity in Germany, however, as foreign
manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor
vehicle parts, above all, recorded a sharp fall
in sales in Germany (-61/C254%) and demandfor imported vehicles stems mainly from
households. Import revenue from goods in
the information and communications tech-
nology sector declined on a similar scale.
Owing to the continued sharp fall in the price
of these goods – in the case of office machin-
ery and computers, prices declined by no less
than 24% – there was, nonetheless, a signifi-
cant increase in imports in real terms. The
value of imported machinery increased only a
little and remained more or less unchanged
on a price-adjusted basis. Overall, therefore,
imports in the traditional machinery and
equipment sector recorded a rise in volume in
2008 that is consistent with the buoyant in-
vestment activity in trade and industry in Ger-
many.
The aggregate value of imports from the euro
area rose by a nominal 63/C254%o r23/C254% in real
terms, whereby the pattern of goods imports
from individual euro-area countries varied
greatly. While imports from France increased
by 6%, supplies imported from Italy rose
merely by 23/C254%. Imports from countries out-
side the euro area rose by 6% in 2008. On a
price-adjusted basis, however, they increased
only marginally. One explanation for this is
the steep increase in the price of energy
and commodities, which come chiefly from
non-euro-area countries. Thus growth in
nominal imports from major oil and gas-
producing countries, such as the OPEC coun-
tries (+311/C254%) and the Russian Federation
(+241/C254%), was therefore particularly high.
Imports from China also rose by a compara-
tively large margin (+51/C254%). By contrast, the
declining trend in imports from the South-
East Asian emerging market countries con-Breakdown of

tive result in 2007, revenue generated fromexports by the new EU member states in cen-tral and eastern Europe increased by 6
1/C254%.
Furthermore, US exporters managed to stabil-ise their sales on the German market fol-lowing the slump of the previous year. Themarked reduction in imports from Japan(-5
1/C254%) is attributable to both the yen’s ap-
preciation against the euro in the second halfof the year, which led to a perceptible in-crease in the price of Japanese goods, andthe cooling of demand for motor vehicles inGermany.
In 2008, a trade surplus of 3178
1/C252billion was
generated on balance. The surplus was 3163/C254
billion down on the record year 2007. This
was due mainly to the worsening of theterms of trade in conjunction with commod-ity prices as well as the slump in exports inthe fourth quarter of 2008 together with per-sistently robust import activity. The deficit on“invisible” current transactions amounted to31
1/C254billion. Overall, the current account sur-
plus, which includes supplementary tradeitems, narrowed to 3165 billion or 6
1/C252%o f

24by lower net income and a higher deficit on
current transfers.
The net deficit on services transactions shrank
by31/C252billion to 3123/C254billion in 2008 owing
to improvements in several segments. Trans-
portation and financial services both made a
marked contribution, with the surpluses in-
creasing by 31 billion in each case to 373/C254bil-
lion and 34 billion, respectively. In the area of
other services, which encompasses a variety
of different positions, the positive balance
amounted to 31 billion, following a slight
deficit in 2007. Increased net earnings from
engineering and other technical services as
well as research and development played a
key role in this regard. Conversely, the net
surplus resulting from insurance services fell
by313/C254billion to 31/C254billion. This was due to
the fact that, in the case of German re-
insurers, the ratio of receipts from premiums
to their payments of claims to non-residents
declined significantly, whereas the business
operations of foreign reinsurers in Germany
improved slightly.
By contrast, the deficit run up in the field of
foreign travel, which is by far the biggest
item in cross-border services, rose by 31/C252bil-
lion to 3343/C254billion in 2008. Although re-
ceipts rose much faster (+31/C252%) than ex-
penditure (+21/C254%), the former are only half
as high as the latter in terms of amount.
Expenditure associated with trips to other
euro-area countries, which account for al-
most half of this entire position, rose percep-
tibly, whereas only slightly more was spent on
journeys to non-euro-area countries. In terms
of individual countries, the picture was verymixed. Of the main European holiday destin-
ations, Italy and Turkey evidently proved per-
ceptibly more attractive to German holiday-
makers, while the popularity of France and
Spain increased only moderately. Travel to the
USA and Asia, which posted the highest
spending growth last year, was probably
boosted by the depreciation of the US dollar
against the euro, which persisted well into
the third quarter.
The surplus in cross-border income declined
by36 billion to 3443/C254billion in 2008 despite
an improvement in the German economy’s
net external position. This was primarily be-
cause of the decrease in the positive outturn
of investment income as expenditure on in-
vestment income grew faster (+ 3121/C254billion)
than the corresponding receipts (+ 361/C252bil-
lion). The rise in resident investors’ income
from abroad was chiefly attributable to in-
creased revenue from bonds and notes and
money market instruments as well as loans to
non-residents, which related inter alia to
cross-border interbank transactions. Owing
to falling short-term interest rates, however,
these did not grow as robustly as in 2007. By
contrast, earnings from direct investment
went down as a result inter alia of the poorer
profitability of foreign subsidiaries.
On the debit side, interest paid to non-
residents on bonds and notes and money
market instruments rose at a slightly higher
rate than in 2007. Moreover, dividend pay-
ments to non-resident investors increased
considerably in the wake of resident enter-
prises’ relatively buoyant earnings in 2007,
when the related profits were largely gener-Services

25ated. Interest payments on bank loans taken
up outside Germany also rose. Conversely,
non-resident investors’ income from direct in-
vestment fell. Overall – applying due caution
owing to the preliminary nature of the figures
– it is likely that the average return on Germa-
ny’s external assets in 2008 fell well short of
the effective rate of return on assets invested
in Germany.
The net deficit arising from current transfers
rose by 311/C252billion to 333 billion in 2008.
This was mainly because of the increase in
net private transfers paid. Furthermore, the
deficit from public transfers also went up by
31/C252billion on the back of increased net trans-
fers to the EU budget. This was influenced by
higher German payments to the EU on the
basis of the national product-related finan-
cing regime as well as excise duties and other
levies. These more than offset the lower Ger-
man VAT contribution to the EU budget and
increased EU payments to Germany in con-
nection with the Common Agricultural Policy.
Financial transactions
The current account surplus is reflected with-
in the balance of payments in Germany’s high
net capital outflows ( 32031/C252billion). The de-
velopment of cross-border financial transac-
tions in 2008 was dominated, however, by
the escalation of the crisis in the financial sec-
tor in the course of the year. In particular, the
insolvency of the US investment bank Leh-
man Brothers in September led to a severe
loss of confidence in the international finan-
cial markets, which was reflected in a dramat-ic decline in the price of risky assets and ne-
cessitated government assistance in many
countries. Furthermore, major central banks
lowered their key interest rates significantly in
several stages. The bond markets were princi-
pal beneficiaries of this. Longer-dated gov-
ernment bond yields in Germany and the
USA fell significantly, whereby the yield
spread widened palpably in favour of domes-
tic instruments. In the foreign exchange mar-
kets, the high degree of uncertainty led to
substantial exchange rate fluctuations. As a
result of the turbulence, market participants
became increasingly more cautious in the
course of the year and liquidated cross-border
positions on a sizeable scale towards the end
of 2008.Balances in cross-border

26The escalation of the crisis is clearly visible in
the securities markets, where changes in in-
vestors’ risk-return perceptions, as past ex-
perience shows, are quickly reflected in trans-
action volumes. Cross-border portfolio turn-
overs may serve as a gauge of the tensions in
the financial system. Thus, whereas the value
of securities bought and sold in the German
balance of payments increased at an average
annual rate of almost 11% from 1999 to
2007, the transaction volume plummeted by
almost 30% between the first and the fourth
quarter of 2008. This slump was much more
severe than that experienced after the price
bubble for technology stocks burst in 2000,
when cross-border securities sales fell by
more than 17% over a comparable period.
This steep slide in turnover partly mirrors the
dramatic drop in the price of many invest-
ment instruments. Above all, however, it
shows that some securities segments became
illiquid in the course of the crisis owing to a
lack of demand and that trading in some
financial products came to a virtual standstill.
2008 saw external portfolio investment close
with net capital inflows of 344 billion; this
was well down on the record inflows of 2007
(31521/C252billion). However, this rather low net
amount masks considerable crisis-related ac-
tivity in the gross flows, by means of which
resident and non-resident investors reacted to
the unfolding events in the reporting period.
Thus a sharp reversal occurred in the invest-
ment behaviour of German investors. Where-
as they had increased their holdings of for-
eign securities by 31451/C252billion in 2007, they
sold foreign instruments worth a net 328 bil-
lion in 2008. These sales began in the thirdFinancial transactions

27quarter and intensified towards the end of
the year. Between October and Decemberalone, German investors disposed of foreignsecurities in the amount of 374
1/C252billion. The
main sellers were financial institutions.
This investment pattern, with different pro-
files in the two halves of the year, is reflect-ed clearly in the purchase of foreign bondsand notes. In the first two quarters, bondsworth 351 billion were bought and thereafter
debt securities to the value of 330
1/C252billion
were sold. The sales were primarily of euro-denominated longer-term debt securities (Julyto December 2008: 323 billion), which are
usually the most popular foreign financial in-strument by far among German investors.As the crisis intensified and investors’ ownfunding requirements grew, they evidentlyfocused increasingly on price and liquidityrisks. Bank debt securities issued by foreignborrowers were most affected by the mar-ket withdrawal; however, government bondsfrom euro-area partner countries were alsosold on balance. The interest rate spread oneuro-area government bonds over GermanFederal bonds (Bunds), which as a safe and li-quid instrument constitute the benchmark,increased by 80 to 95 basis points over theyear.
German investors were also very wary of pur-
chasing bonds and notes denominated in for-eign currencies in 2008, after topping uptheir portfolios with large quantities of suchdebt securities – mostly denominated in USdollars – in previous years. On balance, theypurchased foreign currency bonds worth 38
1/C252
billion (when converted to euro) from foreignissuers in 2008, compared with 3301/C252billion
in 2007. The overall result is skewed, how-ever, by a single large transaction in which afinancial institution acquired asset-backed se-curities from one of its own special-purposevehicles abroad. Without this transaction, anet sell-off would have been recorded. Be-sides a general reluctance to engage in com-plex securitisations, this was probably dueto the euro-dollar interest rate differential,Cross-border portfolio

28which tilted in favour of the euro at the end
of 2007 and for a time widened noticeably in
2008. The high exchange rate volatility may
likewise have prompted investors to take a
more cautious approach to their cross-border
transactions.
In addition to bonds and notes, foreign
money market instruments – which were
used as a financing instrument by special-
purpose vehicles, among others, prior to the
crisis – were also affected by the reorientation
of German investors in the latter part of the
third quarter. Redemptions and sales predom-
inated within this segment of portfolio invest-
ment on balance towards the end of the year,
with the result that net repatriation of funds
in the amount of 3171/C252billion was recorded
in 2008. German capital market participants
mainly offloaded short-dated bonds denom-
inated in US dollars and structured money
market products.
German investors also further reduced their
net holdings of foreign shares ( 339 billion).
Caught in the crossfire of growing concern
about the overall state of the financial sector
and the ever gloomier real economic outlook,
the prices of equities plummeted across a
broad front over the course of the year (-39%
according to the MSCI World Index). Initial
public offerings, and thus supply-side pur-
chase stimuli, were likewise rare in this envir-
onment. As a result, resident investors – pri-
marily from the financial sector whose own li-
quidity needs had increased – withdrew from
the stock markets, especially of EU partner
countries ( 324 billion) and the USA ( 3131/C252bil-
lion).Indirect holdings of securities mediated via
foreign investment companies fell steeply in
2008. Although German residents invested
381/C252billion net in foreign mutual funds, this
was much lower than the amounts invested
in the previous two years ( 3411/C252billion and
3231/C252billion). The cause of this decrease was
that savers sold foreign mutual fund products
from mid-September, when the financial crisis
escalated. In the fourth quarter alone, out-
flows of funds amounted to 3131/C252billion.
Since the withdrawals mainly affected money
market funds and bond-based funds remu-
nerated at money market rates, the decision
to sell may have been influenced by the fact
that, since the beginning of October, invest-
ors have favoured government-guaranteed
deposits at banks in Germany as opposed to
fund-based foreign products remunerated at
money market rates. Furthermore, public dis-
cussion regarding the possible raising of the
tax on tax-optimised money market funds
may have encouraged savers to reduce their
holdings of these products.
Non-residents’ demand for portfolio invest-
ment in Germany also fell distinctly in the
course of 2008. On balance, foreign investors
bought German securities totalling just
316 billion last year. In 2007, they invested a
record value of 3298 billion in the German
market.
This drastic decrease in inflows of funds was
caused by lower foreign demand for German
bonds and notes ( 3231/C252billion compared
with 32031/C252billion in 2007). In the area of
private long-term bonds, sales and redemp-
tions predominated on balance (- 37 billion... money

29compared with net purchases of 3140 billion
in 2007). This was due partly to the sharp de-cline in net cross-border sales of “certificates”and warrants, which some suppliers regularlytransfer en bloc to affiliated enterprises
abroad.
3Moreover, the market turbulence
also led to a strong impetus to sell German is-suers’ traditional bank debt securities, whichwere previously a primary focus of foreign in-vestors. As a result, the interest rate spreadbetween public and private debt securitieswith a maturity of ten years surged to an un-precedented level of 110 basis points towardsthe end of the year.
The severe tensions in the markets for long-
term securitised investments benefited secureand liquid German government bonds. Thiscan be seen first and foremost in their above-mentioned interest rate discount comparedwith government bonds of other Europeancountries and vis-/C224-vis private issues. In termsof volume, however, non-resident buyers pur-chased far fewer Bunds in 2008 than in 2007(330
1/C252billion net compared with 3631/C252billion
net). On the one hand, this decrease relatesto supply factors as net sales of governmentbonds, at 325
1/C252billion, were at their lowest
level since 2001 thanks to German centralgovernment’s successful fiscal consolidationefforts in the past. On the other hand, thesefigures also clearly show how badly somemarket participants needed liquidity in thisdifficult market situation. Thus in the fourthquarter of 2008, when other markets driedup, non-residents disposed of liquid Germangovernment bonds worth 37
1/C252billion net,
thus freeing up some much needed cash.By contrast, German money market instru-
ments found favour with non-resident buyersall year. Overall, demand from non-residentsin 2008 was comparable with 2007 ( 348 bil-
lion net compared with 351
1/C252billion net).
Over half of the amount invested was ac-counted for by short-term “certificates” andwarrants launched by private issuers which,as mentioned above, were transferred to for-eign enterprises within the group until soldon to private investors.
After a five-year boom – measured against
the broad CDAX index – German share pricesplummeted by 44
1/C252% last year amid massive
fluctuations. Owing to the unfavourable eco-nomic outlook and declining prices, foreigninvestors divested from German shares in theamount of 349
1/C252billion, which represented a
huge reversal from the high net capital in-flows seen in the preceding years. Almostone-fifth of these shares related to domesticfinancial institutions ( 39 billion). Another fac-
tor was that a German enterprise, when ittook over a domestic DAX group, acquiredstocks which had previously been held bynon-resident investors to a large extent.
Owing to the crisis, investment in the German
mutual fund sector was very restrained in2008. This was also reflected in the externalsales figures for German mutual fund shares.Outflows of funds in this segment amountedto36 billion net in 2008. This was the highest
3The drop in sales of certificates was accompanied by
lower net capital exports in the area of financial deriva-
tives ( 3251/C252billion compared with 386 billion in 2007),
which are often used to hedge such positions. For more

30level of net outflows to other countries ever
recorded in one year in this sector. Non-
resident investors mainly sold off interest-
bearing units in funds open to the general
public. Only specialised funds managed to at-
tract investors on balance.
The effects of the financial crisis were also
reflected in cross-border direct investment,
although this, owing to its largely medium to
long-term nature, usually reacts considerably
more slowly to changes in financial market
conditions than portfolio investment. Accord-
ing to initial UNCTAD estimates, global direct
investment flows thus declined by around
one-fifth to US$1.4 trillion ( 3950 billion) in
2008, after increasing by 30% in 2007. Mer-
gers and takeovers even showed slightly
stronger declines. This was because of the
very tight curbs on external and internal fi-
nancing capabilities as well as the gloomier
economic outlook.
The unfavourable global conditions also
affected direct investment with German in-
volvement. German incoming and outgoing
direct investment decreased by roughly the
same amount. All in all, net capital exports in
this segment thus remained largely un-
changed at 390 billion in 2008.
At3107 billion, the volume of resources in-
vested abroad by German enterprises in 2008
was lower than in 2007 ( 3131 billion). The
main investment focus was on foreign affili-
ates, which received significantly more equity
capital. Investors from the manufacturing,
energy and transport and communication
sectors used the available opportunities toconsolidate their presence abroad through
takeovers. Furthermore, domestic owners re-
invested a large proportion of the overall high
profits generated by their foreign branches
and subsidiaries in 2008 in their direct invest-
ment enterprises. They also furnished them
with funding within the context of inter-
group loans. This was done predominantly by
granting financial credits, almost two-thirds
of which were of a short-term nature. Over
three-quarters of total German direct invest-
ment flowed into European countries in
2008. The Netherlands ( 318 billion), which
accounted for a large share in connection
with a group restructuring project, Spain
(3151/C252billion), the United Kingdom ( 381/C252bil-
lion) and Sweden ( 38 billion) proved to be
particularly sought-after investment destin-
ations. Outside Europe, German enterprises
additionally invested 3121/C252billion in the USA.
Compared with 2007, the unfavourable global
economic conditions had a much greater im-
pact on foreign direct investment in Germany
than on German enterprises. Foreign direct
investment in Germany amounted to 317 bil-
lion in 2008, down almost 60% on 2007
(341 billion). Foreign proprietors allocated,
above all, less equity capital to their branches
domiciled in Germany. This was due not least
to the sharply contracted activities of private
equity enterprises.4The regional origin of
direct foreign investment in Germany was
heavily influenced by the restructuring of one
group. This resulted in capital inflows of

which comprises financial and trade credits(where not allocated to direct investment) aswell as bank deposits and other assets, re-corded net capital exports in 2008. Theseamounted to 3130 billion compared with
outflows of 3213 billion one year earlier.
Contrary to overall developments, non-banks
recorded net inflows of 333 billion in unse-
curitised financial transactions. Almost three-quarters of this amount related to transac-tions by enterprises and households ( 324 bil-
lion). These chiefly raised long-term loansabroad on balance. Further inflows of fundsof39 billion were allocated to operations of
general government, which raised short-termloans abroad.
The net capital outflows in the area of unse-
curitised financial transactions were thereforeattributable to cross-border transactions in thebanking system. The majority of these relatedto credit institutions’ increase in net externalassets ( 3132
1/C252billion). They issued a consider-
able volume of long-term financial credit toforeign counterparties. Much of this involvedgranting credit to branches and subsidiariesabroad and supporting the banks’ ownspecial-purpose vehicles domiciled outsideGermany, which had come under pressureowing to the financial crisis. The extent towhich the tense situation on the money mar-kets affected banks’ unsecuritised externaltransactions is reflected in the drastic reduc-tion in their short-term cross-border credit
claims and liabilities.
5Since both claims and
liabilities dropped by more or less the sameamount in this segment, the net balance ofpayment flows showed little fluctuation, how-ever. By contrast, a transaction-related 330 bil-
lion increase in the Bundesbank’ s net externalasset position had a more substantial impact.The increase in claims within the TARGET2large-value payment system played a crucialrole in this regard ( 344
1/C252billion). This was par-
tially offset by higher external liabilities, includ-ing central bank deposits at the Bundesbank.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets, transaction-
related changes in which are shown in a sep-arate item in the balance of payments, in-creased by 32 billion in 2008. This was attrib-
utable to the increase in foreign currency re-serves as well as the increase in the Bundes-bank’s reserve position in the IMF (includingspecial drawing rights), following inter alia a
euro draw by the fund.
Apart from the current transactions recorded
in the balance of payments, the reserve assetsgained 34
1/C252billion in value through the usual
revaluation at market prices. This was be-cause of the upward valuation to 368 billion
of the Bundesbank’s gold holdings, which re-sulted from the increase in the price of golddenominated in US dollars and the simultan-eous appreciation of the US dollar against theeuro. All in all, the reserve assets rose by 36

2008, they stood at 399 billion.

33Price convergence
in the euro areaThe euro was expected to give an add-
itional boost to the existing innate ten-
dency in the single market towards
convergence in the prices of compar-
able goods. By eliminating exchange
rate risk in trade among the member
states and making it easier to compare
prices, the single currency was to
stimulate cross-border competition
and thus contribute to price conver-
gence. The present article investigates
the extent to which prices have con-
verged in various member states of
European monetary union in the first
decade of its existence and how far the
introduction of the euro affected
developments in price dispersion. The
empirical findings point, at most, to a
marginal convergence of prices as an
underlying trend. A Bundesbank study
using a micro dataset even tends to in-
dicate price divergences for the market
segment examined. From an economic
policy perspective, an analysis of re-
maining price differentials deserves at-
tention, as they may reflect a price and
cost situation of the country in ques-
tion which signals a possible need for
adjustment.
Reasons for price differentials and
price convergence
The expectation that, in a fully integrated
market, there will be price convergence is
based on considerations of the law of one
price. This law states that the prices of identi-The law of one

34cal, internationally tradable goods at different
locations would have to be the same when
expressed in a single currency; otherwise, risk-
free transactions would be possible, where
the product would be purchased at the cheap
location and sold at a profit at the expensive
location. Such arbitrage transactions would
therefore even out any price differentials.1
Admittedly, it generally cannot be assumed
that exactly the same price is actually to be
paid for a given good in all places. One argu-
ment against this is the existence of transac-
tion costs. These include, in a broad sense,
the costs of transporting a good to the speci-
fied destination, other distribution costs, in-
formation costs, as well as – if there is no sin-
gle currency – the costs of converting pro-
ceeds into a different currency, including the
related costs of hedging against exchange
rate fluctuations. Numerous studies suggest
that, above all, the process of the good cross-
ing a national border accounts for a very
large part of the transaction costs (“border
effect”).2This is generally attributed to the
costs associated with currency conversion in
the widest sense.
The fact that costs of this kind prevent price
adjustments is particularly noticeable in the
case of internationally non-tradable goods,
such as services that have a strong local basis,
like the often-cited visit to the hairdressers, or
the provision of residential property or office
buildings. The reason why services often lack
tradability is also ultimately to be found in the
level of transaction costs, particularly the high
transport costs. This means that, in some
cases, a reduction in such costs might triggercross-border price competition. However, this
will generally lead only to an incomplete con-
vergence of prices and, hence, to a continu-
ing large degree of price dispersion, which is
typical of non-tradable goods.
Nevertheless, for tradable goods, too, there
are other reasons for enduring price differen-
tials. These include tariffs and non-tariff trade
barriers, such as import quotas or differing
technical standards. Different rates of excise
tax are a third cause. Other often-cited phe-
nomena, such as differences in economic
cycles, in stabilisation policy, in country-
specific preferences, or exchange rate fluctu-
ations may indeed affect price dispersion, but
generally cannot prevent arbitrage, which
means that ranges for price differentials due
to transaction costs, customs duties and ex-
cise taxes should not be exceeded.
These factors make it clear that, with regard
to the European Union, the process of eco-
nomic integration has many diverse effects
on price convergence in a single currency
area. Besides a general reduction in transac-
tion costs, the creation of a single market is
likely, in particular, to have substantially re-
duced the significance of tariff and non-tariff
trade barriers. Likewise, in the wake of single
market integration, VAT rates among the EU
countries have also converged. The resulting
1This predominantly applies to arbitrage transactions by
commercial enterprises. However, cross-border purchases
by consumers can, of course, also contribute to price
convergence.
2The literature on the “border effect” goes as far back
as J H Rogers and M Jenkins (1995), Haircuts or hyster-
esis? Sources of movements in real exchange rates, Jour-
nal of International Economics, 38, pp 339-360, and

35deviations in gross prices within the euro area
are therefore generally likely to remain rather
small owing to the relatively similar rates of
VAT, even though excise taxes can make a
considerable contribution to price dispersion
in specific cases, such as tobacco and refined
petroleum products. As far as deviations from
the law of one price can be identified in the
European Union, it is therefore, above all,
probably transaction costs which prevent ar-
bitrage processes among the various coun-
tries, thus making price differentials possible.
The introduction of a single currency further
lowers trade transaction costs in a single mar-
ket and, as a result, increases the incentives
to adjust prices. Furthermore, the single cur-
rency limits the possibilities for price discrim-
ination and market segmentation. If the
actual differences in the prices of individual
internationally tradable goods were so large
that they are greater than the given range of
prices which has now been narrowed due to
the lower transaction costs, prices among the
countries should begin to converge.
The fall in transaction costs as a result of
monetary integration represents a gain in effi-
ciency and, to that extent, boosts welfare.3
First, it eliminates a cost item for enterprises
or consumers. Second, as a result of the more
intense cross-border competition, allocative
efficiency also increases. It may therefore be
expected that the price level of tradable
goods will fall during the convergence pro-
cess because consumers in the former “high
price” regions gain access to cheaper alterna-
tives and because a larger market allows the
exploitation of economies of scale and thus adecline of marginal unit cost in production.
However, for non-tradable goods it is also en-
tirely conceivable that the hoped-for stimulus
to the economic catching-up process associ-
ated with the introduction of the euro has
the effect of raising the price level in the
countries that are catching up (Balassa-
Samuelson effect).4At the same time, these
factors illustrate the difficulty of isolating the
effects of the single currency as a catalyst for
convergence developments from the effects
of the economic integration process within
the euro area as a whole.
Measuring price convergence
in the euro area
Empirical studies on price convergence in the
euro area are confronted with a range of
methodological challenges. It is especially im-
portant to identify the specific impact of the
single currency taken in isolation. Thus,
among other things, it is necessary to deter-
mine the key temporal points of reference. In
principle, two points in time are crucial as
triggers for price adjustment processes as a
result of European monetary union. The first
of these was the beginning of monetary
union at the turn of 1998-99 when the euro

rate movements in the central and east European acces-
sion countries, Monthly Report, October 2002, pp 47-59,

able goods will tend to fall as a result of the introduction
of the euro, while those of non-tradable goods will tend
to rise, is discussed, inter alia, in European Central Bank,

36exchange rates were irrevocably fixed, the
participating countries switched to a single
monetary policy through the Eurosystem, and
the national currencies continued to exist as
cash only as units of account of the euro.
Second, the euro cash changeover at the
start of 2002 should be considered. The
transaction costs of trade within the new sin-
gle currency area may have fallen as a result
of both integration steps. The costs of cur-
rency exchange and of hedging exchange
rates risks had already ceased to exist with
the establishment of the euro area. However,
information costs have also fallen, above all,
as a result of the introduction of euro bank-
notes and coins and the consequent increase
in price transparency.5It therefore seems pru-
dent to consider both points in time in analys-
ing price dispersion in connection with the
introduction of the euro.
Identifying the specific impact of EMU taken
in isolation is also made more difficult by the
fact that the increasing competitive pressure
due to the introduction of the euro might
only gradually produce the expected effect.
Studies which find that long-standing monet-
ary unions, such as that between Belgium
and Luxembourg, have comparatively small
price differentials could indicate extremely
long processes of adjustment.6On the other
hand, enterprises may also have already ad-
justed their prices before the introduction of
the euro as a consequence of the common
market, the low exchange rate fluctuations in
the ERM at that time, and in anticipation of
the future monetary union.7In addition, the data underlying the studies
are of crucial importance in the empirical an-
alyses of relative price adjustment processes.
The price indices usually published in the offi-
cial statistics cannot be used for such a study
owing to their being normalised on a base
period. In order to be able to determine
whether prices converge or diverge, (relative)
price levels are required. If, for example, the
price levels differ in the base period selected
for forming the index, diverging price indices
may nevertheless coincide with price conver-
gence.
Apart from the dataset, the available studies
differ according to the level of aggregation of
the price level used or the measures of disper-
sion. Price measures with a higher level of
aggregation make it possible to derive more
general findings, but have the potential
drawback that the implicitly assumed homo-
geneity of the categories of goods considered
is often not fulfilled. By contrast, more disag-
gregated approaches take greater consider-
ation of the issue of comparability but, given
the more restricted selection of goods, can
only be used to a limited extent for drawing
generalised conclusions. In the light of the
specific advantages and disadvantages of
each of the approaches for measuring price
convergence, a broad range of methods has

this question.
Results for aggregated relative price levels
Highly aggregated relative price levels can be
calculated from purchasing power parities,
which may be found, for example, in Euro-
stat’s AMECO database. These purchasing
power parities state the local currency price
of a given basket of goods, which is, in prin-
ciple, uniform for all countries, in the country
observed relative to a base region. At the
highest level of aggregation, the basket of
goods should represent the entire gross do-
mestic product. Using a relevant nominal ex-
change rate, these relative price levels ex-
pressed in national currency can be converted
into a price level index in currency units of the
region that is relevant for the convergence
comparison (in this case, the euro area).
The relative price levels of a number of euro-
area member states calculated in this way de-
viated by double-digit percentages from the
relevant average EMU price level in both
1998, directly before the introduction of the
euro, and as recently as 2007.8However, dur-
ing the nine years under consideration, it was
only in Ireland that the price level departed
noticeably from the euro-area average. Ac-
cording to these data, the price levels in the
other countries moved closer to the average.
As a general rule, however, the price adjust-
ment remained slight. Starting from com-
paratively high price levels, it was only in Ger-
many and, to a lesser extent, in France and
Austria, that prices showed a considerabledecline compared with the other EMU mem-
ber states. Finland’s price level is still relatively
high, while price levels in Greece, Portugal
and Spain remain relatively low. Unlike at the
beginning of monetary union, Italy no longer
had a below-average price level in 2007.
As a measure of price dispersion, one may
calculate the standard deviation of the rela-
tive price levels across countries at a given
point in time. If this dispersion measure falls
over time, this development is to be interpret-
ed as price convergence.9Relevant figures ac-
tually suggest a reduction in price dispersion
since the establishment of the euro area or
also since the euro cash changeover. The
price convergence is quite weak, however.
This is especially true in comparison with the
previous decade, during which considerable
progress towards convergence had been
made.10Other studies also confirm the find-
ing of distinct price convergence before the
start of monetary union.11
8Relative price levels calculated in this way should not be
confused with indicators of price competitiveness. They
are not trade-weighted and their general suitability for
allowing statements on competitiveness should also be
questioned.
9Such a form of price convergence is also known as
sigma convergence.
10The reduction in price dispersion was interrupted for a
period of several years with the onset of the crisis in the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, but con-
tinued from 1995 onwards. Thus, with regard to relative
price levels, the crisis developments in the first half of the
1990s appear not to have been accompanied by an ad-
justment of earlier undesirable developments, but rather
to have been fraught with problems themselves.

38A more disaggregated analysis affords add-
itional and deeper insights. A first step in this
direction is to consider goods and services
separately. This is of interest because many
services are internationally non-tradable,
which means that, in these cases, price con-
vergence as a consequence of the introduc-
tion of the euro can be expected only to a
limited extent. The relatively low international
tradability should also bring about a com-
paratively high dispersion of prices for ser-
vices. Indeed, price dispersion measured by
the variation coefficient over the period from
1995 to 2007 is roughly twice as high for ser-
vices as it is for goods.12
However, clear progress towards convergence
since the establishment of the euro area can
be identified neither for goods nor for ser-vices. If the period since the euro cash
changeover is examined, there is a slight ten-
dency towards price convergence in the case
of goods. If goods are, in turn, subdivided
into consumer goods and capital goods,
moderate progress towards convergence is
apparent since 1998, with this development
being somewhat more pronounced in the
case of capital goods.
It is noticeable that the price dispersion in
2002 is greater for both the subgroup of con-
sumer goods and the subgroup of capital
goods than it is for the overall aggregate of
all the goods. This is quite possibly a conse-
quence of aggregation which results if, inDeviations from the average relative price level * in the EMU-12 countries

39some countries, for example, positive price
deviations in one category of goods are offsetby negative price deviations in others. For thisreason, a low price dispersion in the aggre-gate does not imply that price dispersion inthe subgroups will be equally low.
This may also affect the transferability of
macroeconomic convergence results to amore disaggregated level. Therefore, in theliterature, measures of dispersion are oftencalculated for individual goods or categoriesof goods and only then are they aggregated,if necessary. As far as this has been investi-gated, both methods produce very similar re-sults on the question of price convergence inthe euro area.
13Nevertheless, other factors,
such as the database used, the test procedureand the chosen observation period appear tohave a perceptible influence on the results.This may explain the conflicting results be-tween studies which, in some cases, havefound marked price convergence for tradablegoods in the euro area when compared withother countries and other studies which areunable to identify such a phenomenon.
14
The picture that emerges – despite all thedifferences in the results of the availablestudies – of major progress towards conver-gence in the decade before the introductionof the euro in comparison with only verymoderate price convergence since may bedue to the liberalisation and integrationmeasures of the European Single Market Pro-gramme. Seen in this light, the single market– as well as the prospect of a single currency –released the impetus for price convergence,which was largely realised before the intro-duction of the euro.

40lowering of price dispersion in the euro area
was already largely exhausted at the end of
the 1990s. Indeed, it can be demonstrated
that price dispersion between pairs of cities
within the euro area at that time was much
the same in size as the price dispersion
between pairs of cities in the USA.15
It should generally be borne in mind that ag-
gregated analyses assume the homogeneity
of the goods in an international comparison.
However, many products are comparable
internationally only to a very limited extent.
This applies especially to broadly based stud-
ies in which aspects of homogeneity cannot
be included with a high degree of intensity
for every product. Furthermore, the price
data on which the analyses are based are
often collected only at a few outlets in a smallnumber of towns and cities. This means that
the recorded prices may, in some cases, not
be representative of the country in question
as a whole. Finally, only list prices, and not ac-
tual transaction prices, are usually collected.
For all these reasons, the cited results from
aggregated approaches are to be interpreted
with caution.
Results of micro data analyses
In principle, it is easier to ensure the homo-
geneity of the products and the representa-
tiveness of the prices when just one product
or a certain category of products is observed.
An early study adopting such an approach for
the question of price convergence in the euro
area looks at the prices of selected consumer
goods and finds no evidence of price conver-
gence since 1999.16Another study, which an-
alyses one of these markets in more detail,
finds small but significant progress towards
convergence, although this only occasionally
exceeds price convergence in non-euro-area
countries.17Given the better comparability of
the observed prices, the results of these stud-
ies may be more reliable than studies which
attempt to depict developments in the aver-
age price dispersion of a large number of
tradable goods in the euro area. However,Variation coefficients for the

41this is countered by the potential drawback
that the macroeconomic impulse may be ob-scured by sector or product-specific effectsand that, as a result, the price dispersion ofthe product displays a pattern that is untyp-ical of all tradable goods. There is an especial-ly large risk of this occurring if the product inquestion is very narrowly defined, say, bylooking at just one manufacturer, and if thechosen sector has special features, such as anuntypical market structure or specific institu-tional regulations.
A Bundesbank study which attempts to avoid
the cited risks and, at the same time, ensurethat the observed products have as high a de-gree of homogeneity and representativenessas possible, analyses the impact of the intro-duction of the euro on the dispersion ofprices using a comprehensive micro datasetfor a major consumer goods segment, ie theEuropean washing machine market, which isespecially suitable for this purpose.
18
A glance at the situation towards the end of1998, immediately before the establishmentof monetary union, shows that the quality-adjusted price deviations from the (unweight-ed) average of the later euro-area countrieswere mostly quite small (for the methodologyused, see the box on pages 42 and 43). Awashing machine of a given quality in Ger-many, for example, cost only 1% more onaverage than the euro-area mean price of thesame appliance. It was only in the Nether-lands that washing machines were consider-ably cheaper, and they were most expensivein France (-10
1/C252%o r+ 51/C252%, respectively,
compared with the euro-area average). Thisshows that the deviations from the law of
one price in what was then the emergingeuro area were still quite considerable forsome pairs of countries. In a number of cases,the calculations produced noticeably morepronounced price deviations when euro-areacountries were compared with non-euro-areaones.
Looking at developments in relative washing
machine prices, what is initially striking isthat, in the nine years since the start of 1997(the available data go up until the end of2005), there was a gradual decline in prices inthe euro-area countries.
19Towards the end of
the observation period, the net prices in the“most expensive” country of the single cur-rency area were some 20% lower and thosein the “cheapest” country around 30% lowerthan at the start of the observation period.The most pronounced fall in prices was inGermany, which, at the beginning of 1997,was still one of the countries with the highestprices. From the end of 2000, however, it wasinvariably in the group of countries with thecheapest appliances. Moreover, the differ-ence between the average price in the “mostexpensive” country and the “cheapest”country in the period between 1997 and

42Deutsche BundesbankA comprehensive micro dataset on prices and sales volumes of washing machines
Empirical studies on cross-border price convergence
require data on price levels of – as far as possible –
identical goods in various countries. Using raw data
from the market research institution GfK Retail and
Technology, the Bundesbank has built up such a micro
dataset for washing machines. In this market, any ef-
fect of the introduction of the euro on price disper-
sion should be easy to identify. This seems evident,
first, because the product in question – a washing ma-
chine – is not only highly tradable internationally, but
also actually traded intensively on a regular basis.
Second, the product-specific quality features are easily
captured, which means that comparability across dif-
ferent countries can generally be reliably ensured.
The data are available at a four-month frequency for
the period from 1995 to 2005 and at a two-month fre-
quency for the period from 2000 to 2005. The data
cover transactions in 17 European countries. Ten of
these, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the
Netherlands became members of European monetary
union during the observation period. The others are
the United Kingdom, as well as Scandinavian and cen-
tral and east European states.
The underlying data on transactions in washing ma-
chines are based, first, on GfK universe studies (which
are carried out regularly roughly every two to three
years and which capture the market structure). Add-
itionally, the GfK collects samples stratified by distri-
bution channel at considerably shorter intervals. The
data collected in these samples are extrapolated sep-
arately for each distribution channel based on the re-
sults of the universe studies. Aggregating across the
distribution channels then gives the country-specific
average price and the volume of sales for each model
of washing machine. The resulting dataset comprises,
on average, 90% of all transactions in the countries
mentioned and thus covers each of the markets al-
most completely. A further fact which indicates thatthe data are highly reliable is that 90% of the infor-
mation is collected electronically through the enter-
prise resource planning systems of the retail trade. In
contrast to most other datasets containing the prices
of identical goods in various countries, this dataset
covers not only list prices but also actual transaction
prices. Knowing the volumes of sales also allows the
prices to be weighted accordingly, which further in-
creases the reliability of an international price com-
parison.
In addition to the average gross prices of the individ-
ual models, the micro dataset also contains their net
prices, which were calculated using data from the
European Commission on the relevant rates of VAT in
the countries under consideration. As a rule, net
prices are more suitable for a cross-border price com-
parison, because the destination principle is usually
applied in international trade, ie import products are
freed from the VAT of the exporting country and sub-
ject to the VAT of the importing country. The net
prices are therefore hardly affected by varying rates
of VAT.1
The richness of the data is already apparent from the
number of observations per country. For a given time
period, this value corresponds to the number of
models for which transactions were noted during this
time in the relevant country. For a period of two
months, these involved 1,138 models on average be-
tween 2000 and 2005 in Germany, for example, and
1,173 models for a four-month period on average be-
tween 1995 and 2005. For Germany, summing all
36 periods in the former case gives a total of 40,963
observations, and summing all 33 periods in the latter
case gives a total of 38,707 observations. Across all the
countries, the first dataset comprises more than
390,000 observations and the second dataset more
than 330,000 observations.
1However, in most cases of non-commercial imports by consumers
within the euro area, there is, for reasons of practicability, no border
adjustment (origin principle), which means that gross prices are rele-
vant in this regard. — 2Database: four-month data for 1995:1 to

43In order to create as great a degree of international
comparability as possible, the (logarithmic) washingmachine prices can be adjusted for the differing qual-ity features of the individual washing machine modelsin what is known as a hedonic regression. This in-cludes the above-mentioned technical features, suchas the machine’s loading capacity or spin speed. More-over, the brand name can be taken into account,which seems reasonable as this may affect the pro-duct’s properties – such as its robustness – in the eyesof consumers. In a recently published study

sion equation of this kind was estimated, according towhich the price of model kin country iat time t,P

The regression results of the study show, among otherthings, that an increase in the loading capacity of 1 kgraised the price of the washing machine by an aver-age of 5% during the observation period in the coun-tries under consideration; a built-in dryer, to give asecond example, raised the price by an average of26% (see the table above).

442001 remained more or less constant, where-
as it widened noticeably thereafter.
At the end of the observation period, from
September to December 2005, the prices for
most euro-area countries actually deviated to
a much greater extent from the law of one
price than they did immediately before the
establishment of monetary union. The aver-
age net prices of washing machines of a
given quality were a two-digit percentage
figure below the euro-area average in three
countries (Austria, Finland and Germany) and
more than 10% above the average in three
other countries (Greece, Italy and Spain). The
difference between the prices in the “cheap-
est” and “most expensive” country increased
from 16% at the end of 1998 to 27% at the
end of 2005.20All of this indicates that pricedispersion in the euro-area washing machine
market – far from having decreased, as was
expected – was increasing yet further after
the introduction of the euro.21
Formal tests for price convergence confirm
these results. Irrespective of the chosen ob-
servation period and the convergence test
used, the hypothesis of a narrowing price dis-
persion in the euro area is rejected. Particular-
ly since the millennium changeover, there has

competition, would lead to a general adjustment to a

45divergence in the washing machine market
(see the box on page 46).
However, in principle, these results could be
due to price developments in individual coun-tries, which possibly obscure the general pic-ture. Whether this is actually the case is inves-tigated using an econometric method, whichidentifies groups of countries, known as“convergence clubs”, whose prices are con-verging. Countries which did not belong tothe euro area during the observation periodare also included. If the introduction of theeuro had promoted the expected price con-vergence, such a method should establish a“convergence club” that contains a relativelylarge number of euro-area countries but, atmost, very few non-euro-area countries.However, it emerges that most “convergenceclubs” contain only a few countries and in-clude both euro-area and non-euro-areacountries. This result, too, confirms that, forthe product in question, neither the establish-ment of the euro area nor the euro cashchangeover has so far led to a perceptibleprice convergence in the euro area.
The question arises as to what might be the
causes of the identified cases of price diver-gence. Various hypotheses come into consid-eration for this, although their soundnesscannot be assessed conclusively yet. It is con-ceivable, for example, that there have beendifferences in the development of distributioncosts in the euro-area countries. In this con-nection, it is noticeable that, towards the endof the observation period, the price level ishighest precisely in those countries whereunit labour costs have risen most sharplysince the launch of monetary union and that,
conversely, a very low price level prevails inthose countries where the growth in unitlabour costs also remained small.
22According
to a second hypothesis, the mark-up onprices in the individual countries’ distributionsector could have diverged, for example, as aresult of aggressive price reduction strategiesor the establishment of more efficient distri-bution channels in a subgroup of euro-areacountries. Third, it is also conceivable thathigher transport costs have played a role.After all, the period of increasing price disper-sion coincides with a sharp rise in fuel prices,which means that the costs of cross-borderRelative net price of a

46Tests for price convergence in the euro area
Various methods are available for testing price con-
vergence. An especially uncomplicated method is
an F test, which compares the price dispersion in
the form of its cross-border variance at two differ-
ent points in time.1If it proves to be the case that
price dispersion at the later point in time is signifi-
cantly smaller than before, then price convergence
exists. This method has the advantage of requiring
price observations at only two different points in
time for each country. By contrast, if price time ser-
ies are available, an F test uses only a small part of
the available information and therefore appears ar-
bitrary. A further disadvantage of this method is
that the test assumption that the two variances
being compared with each other are mutually inde-
pendent is often not met in time series.
Panel unit root tests are a second method of testing
for price convergence.2Here, the time series of the
price levels first have to be normalised vis-/C224-vis price
developments in a base country. If the null hypoth-
esis of non-stationarity is rejected for the resulting
relative price series, this is usually interpreted as an
indication of price convergence or, at least, the val-
idity of the law of one price. Tests such as these are
geared to a concept of convergence which differs
from that of the other tests mentioned. Price dis-
persion, in particular, plays no explicit role in this
context. These tests also focus more on the question
of whether the relative prices always return to a
fixed value in the long term, ie in a certain sense
whether the prices have already converged. A pro-
longed, gradual convergence process, by contrast,
may perhaps not be recognised as such.
The recently developed “log t” test should be men-
tioned as another method.3This test is independent
of the stationarity properties of the time series ana-
lysed and allows temporary periods of divergenceas well as different speeds of adjustment. As a first
step within this test, the individual price series are
smoothed and set in relation to the average price
development. From this, across all the countries, a
variance Htis formed for each point in time t. Fol-
lowing this, the equation
ln/C16
H1
Ht/C17
/C02ln½lnðtþ1Þ/C138 ¼ aþblntþut (1)
is to be estimated using a heteroscedasticity and
autocorrelation-consistent method. If the variance
Htdecreases over time t, ie in the case of price con-
vergence, coefficient bshould be positive. The null
hypothesis of price convergence is thus b$0. Given
a significance level of 5%, the one-sided test is to
be rejected for t-values of b^which are lower than
–1.65.
If this method is applied to the time series of
quality-adjusted washing machine prices, the values
given in the table below are obtained.4
In all cases, the computed value falls well short of
the critical value. Price convergence can therefore
be confirmed neither for the group of euro-area
countries nor for the EU countries as a whole. The
other two test methods mentioned, F tests and
panel unit root tests, confirm this result.

example, in M Lutz (2004), Price convergence under EMU?

Conclusion
The results of empirical studies on price con-
vergence owing to the introduction of the
euro differ individually depending on the
methodology chosen, the goods or categories
of goods observed, and the periods of time
analysed. However, what is common to most
studies is the finding that, during the past ten
years, there has been, if at all, only a moder-
ate tendency to further price convergence in
the euro area. Especially in comparison with
the decade before the introduction of the
euro, there has been a marked slowdown in
the pace of convergence. This suggests that
monetary union’s autonomous contribution
to price convergence should not be overesti-
mated. By contrast, the vast majority of the
studies find that economic integration within
Europe has given a substantial impetus to a
levelling of existing price differentials.
These results are also confirmed by a Bundes-
bank study based on micro data using a new
dataset for a specific group of products
– washing machines – which is so far unique
in the European context for the investigation
of price convergence. This study shows that
the introduction of the euro has hitherto had
no perceptible stimulating effect on priceconvergence. Since 2000, the prices of wash-
ing machines in the single currency area ap-
pear to have tended to diverge, in fact. Cau-
tion should be exercised when drawing more
far-reaching conclusions from this, however.
First, it is unclear how far it is possible to gen-
eralise the results for the observed product.
Furthermore, the results are preliminary inso-
far as the convergence process might still re-
quire more time. Finally, it also cannot be
ruled out that potential convergence effects
of the monetary union have been obscured
by sector-specific developments. For ex-
ample, unlike the micro-based results, macro-
economic variables point to slight price con-
vergence within the euro area. Nevertheless,
even this study found that convergence was
noticeably weaker than before the introduc-
tion of the euro.
Despite the above-mentioned qualifications,
the price trends found in the micro data study
deserve a great deal of attention, since, in the
countries observed, they are accompanied by
matching divergences in unit labour costs
within the euro area. In this respect, they
could also reflect structural shifts in price
competitiveness among the euro-area coun-
tries, which might call for adjustments.23

individual euro-area countries are examined in detail in

49Cashless payments
in Germany and
the role of the
Deutsche Bundesbank
Developments and key trends
over the past 50 yearsCashless payment and securities settle-
ment systems are a transaction-related
infrastructure within the financial sec-
tor and as such make a major contribu-
tion to financial stability. They have
demonstrated their reliability and ro-
bustness even in the current crisis.
Advances in information technology
and the banking industry’s willingness
to invest are the primary factors that
have made payments1at once faster,
cheaper and safer. Paper-based pay-
ments have been unerringly replaced
by the use of electronic data records,
thus providing a major pillar for the
stability and efficiency of payments in
Germany. This development has also
been driven by a highly competitive
environment, in which providers are
willing to undergo extensive standard-
isation. In the last two decades, the
increasing use of the gross settlement
principle and “immediate reciprocity”
settlement have further reduced the
risks in payments and in foreign ex-
change and securities settlement. Ef-
forts to create a Single Euro Payments
Area (SEPA) show that the challenges
raised by the EU Single Market and the
euro have not been completely sur-
mounted. However, SEPA is bringing
Europe closer to the goal of an inte-
grated financial market.

of the cashless variety.

50Economic importance of payments
Non-stop exchange between market partici-
pants is a key element of a specialised econ-
omy. Nowadays, it would be inconceivable
without a functioning cashless payment sys-
tem. Although banknotes and coins still play
a major role in face-to-face retail transactions,
significant economic transactions are con-
ducted without cash, either by means of
transfers from deposits or from approved
credit lines on current accounts. The direct
debit (6.9 billion in 2007) and credit transfer
(5.2 billion in 2007) are, in terms of number,
the dominant payment instruments which
account holders can use to move their funds.
In terms of value, however, credit transfers
make up more than 80%. Payment systems,
which enable various banks to exchange pay-
ments, serve as the primary infrastructure for
the settlement of cashless payments. In many
countries, different systems are used for retail
and individual payments. Whereas retail pay-
ments comprise small-value, low-priority pay-
ments, individual payments are characterised
by urgent large-value payments.
Efficient and safe payment and settlement
systems are of major importance for the
economy and the financial sector. In highly
advanced economies, the stability of payment
systems is a public good that benefits all its
users. Disruptions to the flow of payments
can impair economic agents’ confidence and
thus also adversely affect the real and finan-
cial sectors of the economy. The importance
of stable payment and settlement systems is
underscored by the current upheaval that has
gripped the financial markets in many coun-tries. For instance, malfunctioning technology
can trigger or exacerbate a crisis if market
participants falsely assume that their borrow-
ers are having a liquidity problem because an
expected payment has not arrived. This is par-
ticularly true of individual payments, in which
large-value interbank payments are settled in
real time, but also applies to retail payments;
this may serve to explain why there are so
many ways in which payments are exceeding-
ly important to central banks.
There are considerable economic advantages
to payment and settlement systems being not
just stable but also efficient. The more effi-
ciently these systems operate, the lower the
charges needed to cover the costs of monet-
ary or securities transactions can be set. Pass-
ing on these lower costs makes the users of
these systems more competitive. Keeping the
costs of transactions low is thus a key factor
in making a financial centre attractive. This
ultimately also has a positive impact on the
real economic framework of the business
location. Payment systems, as well as secur-
ities settlement systems, have a dual business
policy role for banks. One is to minimise costs
through standardisation and automation; the
other is that account management, and thus
payment services, are also strategically im-
portant to credit institutions as a means of
“opening the door” to many other types of
business. Revenue from payment services (eg
card payments) and in securities trading for
third parties (purchase, sale, custody and
asset management) also makes reliable con-
tributions to the bottom line.Functioning

51The role of the Bundesbank in payments
Responsibility for cashless payments – along
with monetary policy, banking supervision,
financial stability and currency supply – is one
of the Deutsche Bundesbank’s core tasks.2
The Bundesbank engages in various activities
to fulfil this public mandate. Firstly, it moni-
tors payment systems, procedures and instru-
ments in order to observe and analyse the
risks of payment systems and help market
participants mitigate these risks. On this
basis, and given that stable payment systems
are a public good, the Bundesbank, secondly,
catalytically coordinates and shapes payment
policy and thus also the framework for the
development of cashless payments. Thirdly,
the Bundesbank also operates its own sys-
tems. Because of the close relationship be-
tween payment policy and the operative im-
plementation of monetary policy, and in the
light of the attendant risks to financial stabil-
ity, the Bundesbank is more deeply involved
in individual payments than in retail pay-
ments.
Oversight of payments
Payment systems oversight is a central bank
task that has become visibly more important
over the past few years. Oversight is focused
on payment systems that are of particular
– and thus systemic – importance. Oversight
standards for these systems were developed
at international level by the G10 central bank
governors: they are called the Core Principles
for Systemically Important Payment Systems
(BIS, January 2001). The responsible oversight
agencies review the systems for compliancewith the oversight standards and, if neces-
sary, act to effect changes. However, over-
sight can also be expanded to cover less im-
portant payment systems, individual payment
instruments, the operators of systemically im-
portant payment infrastructures and other
payment service providers. On the basis of a
national legal foundation and the Eurosystem
oversight policy framework, as well as in
cooperation with the G10 central banks, the
Bundesbank oversees a number of payment
systems and instruments, infrastructure oper-
ators and other payment service providers.
These activities also include the monitoring of
all payment operations in Germany.
Payment systems policy
Automation and information technology
Today’s payments environment is the product
of a forward-looking and sustainable pay-
ment systems policy which – beginning in the
1960s – sought to maintain state-of-the-art
efficiency and safety of payment systems. The
two principles of stability and efficiency are
mutually reinforcing: only an efficient system
will remain stable and safe in the long run, by
being able to generate the funds needed for
continuous evolution and the safeguarding of
its integrity. Conversely, only a safe system is
also an efficient system: only safe systems
can enjoy a continuously high level of accept-

52ance among users, whose numbers make
economies of scale and reduced marginal
costs possible in the first place. Within this
framework, however, individual interbank
payments, with their urgent large values, are
more strongly oriented towards safety and
rapid finality (ie payments are deemed to
have been completed) than retail payments,
for which efficiency plays a more important
role because of the large volume.
The main reason why payment systems in
Germany are so highly efficient today is that
institutional providers of payment services,
especially the credit institutions and their cen-
tral associations, have been willing to cooper-
ate with each other and the Bundesbank as
well as to invest heavily in new systems. This
has resulted in an unerring replacement ofpaper-based payments by paperless, auto-
mated electronic payment settlement. The
Bundesbank was an active participant in this
process. It is seeking, in a cooperative ap-
proach, to coordinate the interests and
decisions of all parties involved in payments
and to nudge them towards the aims of
shorter processing times, lower settlement
costs, greater safety and stability.
In the awareness that common standards and
procedures are the only way to efficiently
manage retail payments,3the central associ-
ations of the banking industry deal with pay-
ment issues in the “Business Management
Committee” of the Central Credit Commit-
tee, which was established in 1953. The
Committee’s main focus is on developing
interbank standards which do not interfere
with the client-bank relationship. The “Auto-
mation” working group, in existence since
1959 and operating under the aegis of the
Bundesbank, is responsible for discussing the
policy aspects of automation in payments
and for coordinating decisions. At the same
time, competition in the German financial
system – on this joint basis – is intense. This
benefits the users of payment services by
keeping the transactions and account man-
agement costs at a level below that of many
other countries. In the meantime, numerous
credit institutions in Germany have begun to
offer free current accounts again.Cashless payments

53The agreements on uniform formats, stand-
ards and procedures were drafted as multilat-eral treaties and adopted by mutual consent.Credit institutions belonging to one of thebanking associations were governed by theseagreements through their membership; non-banking association members signed individ-ual agreements. These agreements are bind-ing on all participants in payment operations.Examples include the agreements on credittransfers, the collection of cheques, directdebit transactions or paperless data exchange.This does not obstruct innovation since theintroduction of new technical and operationalfeatures can be accommodated by flexibleadaptation of the agreements.
The automation of payments was achieved
by way of numerous decisions and meas-ures.
4A distinction is usually made between
the “first stage of automation”, in whichvoucher processing was streamlined (thisperiod saw the introduction of standardisedforms, the coding line, machine-readableprinting and the bank sort code),
5and the
“second stage of automation”. The idea ofthis stage was to avoid paper altogether or tomake the conversion of payment data intoelectronic data records mandatory at theearliest possible stage of processing. In by-passing the expensive and error-prone pro-cess of handling vouchers manually, the orderis automatically routed directly to the recipi-Milestones in the advancement of paperless payments
Year Event
1975 The paperless exchange of data media (DTA) for credit transfers and direct debits was launched.
1985 The paperless cheque collection procedure (BSE) was launched.
It was initially adopted for cheques for less than DM1,000; this limit was raised to less than DM2,000 from1989, to less than DM5,000 from 1993 (and the procedure made mandatory beginning in 1998). From 1999,the limit was less than 53,000; this limit was raised to less than 56,000 from 2004.
1990 The Bundesbank launched its Electronic Access (EA) for processing submissions and deliveries via data
telecommunication.
1990: for individual payments in the Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) net system1992: for individual payments in the Euro Link System (ELS) real-time gross system2000: for retail payments in the electronic Retail Payment System (RPS)
1991 Transaction fees were introduced by the Bundesbank.
Paper-based payments: DM0.05 per credit transfer and DM0.10 per collection itemPaperless payments: DM0.01 per data record
1992 Credit institutions were required to convert paper-based credit transfers into data records;
initially from DM10,000 and for intercity credit transfers only; from 1994, this limit was lowered to DM1,000and extended to local credit transfers; this requirement was extended to all credit transfers from 1997.
1993 Credit institutions were required to convert direct debits to data records.1994 The large-value cheque collection procedure (GSE procedure) was introduced.2007 The image-based cheque collection procedure (ISE procedure) was launched.

54ent (“straight-through processing”) at very
low marginal costs. Without rigorous stand-
ardisation, this would not have been feasible.
The growth of home banking and of the use
of payment cards by individuals is causing the
volume of vouchers to fall further, thus redu-
cing the costs to the banking industry. There
were around 88 million bank accounts in
Germany at the end of 2007, of which
around 30 million were already being oper-
ated online. The high acceptance of online
banking underscores the fact that modern
payment instruments will only receive sustain-
able acceptance in the market once users be-
lieve that they are sufficiently safe and reli-
able.The Bundesbank has always expressly sup-
ported and encouraged efforts to make auto-
mation as extensive as possible by opening it-
self up for electronic data exchange with the
banking industry – alongside its coordinating
and catalytic role.6It has introduced a logical
and consistent price scale for the services it
offers in order to replace paper-based or anti-
quated procedures. Even in the operation of
its own procedures, the Bundesbank has
streamlined data transfer as far as possible.
At the end of 2008, the percentage of data
records transmitted by data telecommuni-
cation – ie without data media (diskettes,
tapes) – directly to computer systems was in
excess of 99%. In addition, the Bundesbank
recently also improved and modernised ac-
cess and communication standards for the
computer systems open to its customers by
using the Electronic Banking Interface Com-
munication Standard (EBICS) and the Finan-
cial Transaction Services (FinTS).7
Another example of the measures to elimin-

55ume, is virtually negligible (81.9 million in
2007).8The average values transacted via
cheques, however, are still relatively high. Dir-ect debits are particularly better suited to fullyautomated electronic straight-through pro-cessing than cheques.
The immense advances in information tech-
nology (IT) have enabled data processing anddata access at increasing speeds and made itpossible for more and more data to be stored.They are at once the foundation and the en-gine of the modernisation of the payment in-frastructure. A comparison of the volume andvalue of payments settled by the Bundesbankin the 1960s with today’s figures shows clear-ly that many more payments, of increasingvalue overall, are being settled, while theworkforce needed has simultaneously shrunkdrastically. This is also shown by the adjacenttable. In individual payments, it is the trans-acted values that have tended to rise sharply.The transacted values in individual paymentsnearly tripled from 1999 to 2008 (from 386
trillion in 1999 to as much as 3250 trillion in
2008; both figures per annum). Over thesame period, the volume of transactions peryear rose from around 30 million payments to47 million payments. By contrast, that part ofretail payments settled via the Bundesbankremained largely unchanged, at a range ofbetween 2.16 billion and 2.47 billion transac-tions per year with a transacted value of be-tween 32.1 trillion and 32.3 trillion; however,
at the same time retail payments in Germanyrose overall. Retail payments settled via theBundesbank represent less than 1% of thetransacted value in individual payments, orroughly the turnover achieved in two individ-
ual payment working days.
Because of the growing size in individual pay-
ments, the total value of transactions settledvia the Bundesbank in 2008 stood at about18 times its figure in 1980 and a mighty316 times its figure in 1960. By contrast, thevolume of transactions rose by only 70%(from 1.48 billion to 2.52 billion) between1980 and 2008, as the dominant volumefrom retail payments relative to the transact-ed values rose much more moderately.

56As a “network product”, cashless payment
systems are particularly suited to converting
improvements in IT performance directly into
increasingly efficient and effective payment
products. Payment systems that transport
and process payment messages that have
been converted into electronic data records
are subject to the specific economic param-
eters that govern digital goods. These include
high overhead costs in development and low
marginal costs of ongoing production and,
given the existing network externalities, the
need to reach a “critical mass” of market
share.9In addition, the speed of innovation is
high, which means that existing applications
are characterised by shorter and shorter prod-
uct life-cycles. However, the growing de-
mands on data and application security are
driving costs up.
Liberalisation, European integration and
risk mitigation for transactions
In tandem with the ever-increasing automa-
tion, other factors have also been affecting
domestic and cross-border payments to a
growing extent.
The onset of financial market deregulation
and liberalisation caused foreign exchange
and securities trading to swell sharply. Finan-
cial innovations, derivatives and financial
market competition took on increasing im-
portance. The rapidly rising need to mitigate
the risks of financial transactions has also had
an impact on the payment landscape.
As early as 1974, the Herstatt bank’s insolv-
ency heightened financial market partici-pants’ awareness of, not least, foreign ex-
change settlement risk. Here, for contracts
for which the parties are located in different
time zones, performance by one party is due
before that of the other party. If the counter-
party defaults, he may well no longer be able
to render performance. However, “immedi-
ate reciprocity” causes the risk to decrease
accordingly. Therefore, foreign currency trad-
ing increasingly saw the introduction of “pay-
ment versus payment”, and securities trading
“delivery versus payment”. The institutional-
isation of the delivery versus payment prin-
ciple is embodied by CLS Bank (Continuous
Linked Settlement), domiciled in New York
City and active since September 2002, where
banks in various time zones can settle foreign
exchange transactions with various currencies
securely on the basis of previously provided
central bank liquidity.
Given the growing recognition of the need
for gross settlement systems which permit
real-time settlement in central bank money in
order to effectively mitigate risks in payments,
the “Lamfalussy Recommendations” were
adopted by a group of international experts
in November 1990, thereby representing a
paradigm shift. In the systems that were
dominant up until well into the 1990s, which
operated under the net settlement principle
(offsetting mutual claims but offsetting the
resultant balances on the accounts only at
certain times in the future), liquidity difficul-
ties or insolvency of one participant could

57cause domino effects preventing settlement
and, in an extreme case, leading to illiquidityof other participants (“systemic risk”). In“gross settlement systems”, each single pay-ment is predicated on sufficient cover. Therapid finality thus enabled is purchased atthe cost of tighter liquidity, which can becompensated for with interest-free intradaycredit, a sophisticated queuing procedureand, in some cases, through countervailingpayments.
Developments in the European Union – in-
cluding incremental enlargement, the SingleMarket and the introduction in 1999 of thesingle currency – also had far-reaching impli-cations for payment systems. In individualpayments, cross-border payments acquiredfar greater importance. To further harmonisepayments in the EU, as early as in 1993 an an-alysis was made of similarities and differencesbetween the various payment systems in allEU countries and joint minimum standardsdefined (in the report of the Working Groupon EC Payment Systems of the EC centralbank governors entitled “Minimum commonfeatures for domestic payment systems”).

And it was precisely the introduction of theeuro, which as a shared currency requires aunified money market in all euro-area coun-tries, that necessitated the development ofcompletely new procedures and systems forinterbank payments. By contrast, the numberof transactions and values transacted in cross-border retail payments initially remained limit-ed – and with it the pressure to economiseand to harmonise.The TARGET
11system, which was introduced
in January 1999 in the Eurosystem and pro-vides automated real-time settlement withimmediate finality in highly liquid andinsolvency-proof central bank money and isoperated by central banks, is what made theeuro possible from a payments perspective inthe first place. In principle, TARGET enables allbanks in the EU to exchange payments withall other banks directly or indirectly. The grosssettlement principle was one of the factorsthat has helped ensure that, despite the lackof trust among credit institutions during thecurrent financial crisis and the impairment tothe interbank money market and money mar-ket trading that it has caused, the actualinterbank payments have continued to func-tion well.
At the same time, the highly standardised
and harmonised euro payment system hasnot only opened up greater business oppor-tunities for the banking industry as a wholebut conversely – following the replacementof the various legacy currencies – led to inten-sified competition. The European BankingAssociation (EBA) operates Euro 1, an individ-ual payments procedure which is designed asa net settlement system but, thanks to vari-ous provisions, is likewise extremely secure.
Intraday credit is a particularly important
element in solving the structural liquidityproblem in gross settlement systems. In order

58to limit the risk to the central bank as the
lender, intraday credit in the Eurosystem has
to be backed by eligible assets which, if the
credit is not repaid on time – thereby spilling
over into overnight credit – can serve as
collateral. The pronounced “frontloaded”
nature of TARGET payments at the Bundes-
bank is thus due also to the interest-free col-
lateralised intraday loan since the early use of
intraday liquidity via payment orders costs thedelivering bank relatively little12yet “greases
the wheels” of the system with liquidity.
Every day, on average, around 50% of all
transactions are already settled in the first
three hours (out of an 11-hour operating
day); after around 41/C252hours, nearly 50% of
the value has been transacted.
In addition, a considerable amount of effort
has been made to limit risks in payments in
the event of severe technical disruptions or
other harmful external impacts (backup sys-
tems and procedures, business continuity and
contingency planning).
Bundesbank operates its own payment
systems
Examples of how the Bundesbank also fulfils
its statutory mandate by operating its own
systems and applications include TARGET and
its successor system, TARGET2, which was
introduced in November 2007. There are dif-
ferent motives and rationales, from a central
banking perspective, for participating in indi-
vidual payments and retail payments.

59erations via the central banks’ account sys-
tem, individual payments are a preconditionfor efficient money market managementand for implementing monetary policy usingmarket-based instruments.
Since 19 November 2007, all TARGET2 par-
ticipants have been using a “Single SharedPlatform”, developed and operated on behalfof the ESCB by three central banks (theBanque de France, the Banca d’Italia and theDeutsche Bundesbank),
13to settle their euro
payments.
There are two reasons why central banks play
a prominent role in individual payments: theoperational implementation of monetary pol-icy, and the considerable advantages to creditinstitutions in settling payments in centralbank money via central banks’ accounts.Since all credit institutions hold at least oneaccount at their central bank, the balances onwhich are used as cover for interbank pay-ments (also known as “working balances”),interbank credit transfers are often settled viathe central bank, which acts as a “settlementagent”. It is also conceivable that other majorinstitutions could take on this role as a “cen-tral institution”, in a manner similar to therole played by the Landesbanken for the sav-ings banks or the central institutions of creditcooperatives for their affiliated credit co-operative institutions. However, the perform-ance of “settlement agent” functions by theTARGET2-Securities
Years after the introduction of monetary union,
European securities settlement remains frag-mented, with many central securities depositor-ies holding an island position in their nationalenvironment and hence minimising competition.Although some central securities depositorieshave made visible tentative moves in this direc-tion, a far-reaching consolidation of Europeansecurities settlement has yet to occur – in con-trast to the consolidation of central banks’ pay-ment systems in TARGET2 – owing, among otherfactors, to the central securities depositories’ di-verging interests and their differing ownershipstructures. Cross-border securities settlement inEurope is less efficient and more expensive thandomestic settlement; among other things, this isbecause settlement is effected according to dif-ferent standards and methods across countries.In order to provide an integrated infrastructurefor securities settlement for the single Europeancapital market, the Eurosystem will offerTARGET2-Securities (T2S) as a service for settlingsecurities transactions in central bank money. Inits basic features, T2S reflects the TARGET2 phil-osophy, according to which a single technical ITplatform is more efficient, cost-effective anduser-friendly than the current decentralised sys-tem and is thus also in line with other Europeaninitiatives in the area of clearing and settlement(eg Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settle-ment). T2S is a pure settlement service; securitiescustody as well as the associated services remainin the hands of the national central securities de-positories. Once settlement has been centralisedand the cash and securities legs have been inte-grated in a single platform, cross-border settle-ment will be just as simple and efficient in futureas today’s domestic settlement as well as signifi-cantly cheaper owing to economies of scale. Therealisation of T2S and TARGET2 on the Eurosys-tem’s single shared platform also holds signifi-cant potential for synergy and will thereforehelp to reduce costs even further. The DeutscheBundesbank, the Banque de France and theBanca d’Italia, which are already responsible forthe development and operation of TARGET2, areworking together with the Banco de Espa/C230a todevelop T2S on behalf of the Eurosystem andwill operate it on the single shared platform. Un-like private providers, the Eurosystem is not com-mercially motivated and – as a neutral agent –will provide the service on a break-even basis,which rules out profit-maximising monopolisticbehaviour. Moreover, T2S has the potential to actas a catalyst for further harmonisation of legisla-tion and technology.

60central bank is more likely to offer advan-
tages to the banking industry as a whole.
There are several reasons: central banks are
not subject to insolvency risk, at least in do-
mestic currency; the central bank money
used to settle balances is the best form of
liquidity for the banking industry (maximum
acceptance and usability and minimum risk);
and central banks are competitively neutral.
In addition, only central banks can act as the
“lender of last resort” in order to provide
urgently needed additional liquidity at very
short notice. Furthermore, central providers
of individual payment systems can take
advantage of the benefits of low marginal
costs, standardisation and economies of
scale. These benefits accrue to users as well.
The advantages provided by the central
bank’s role are the main reason why securities
settlement systems also settle the cash leg of
their transactions in central bank money at
the central bank.
With respect to the competition that exists
between financial centres, the remuneration
on minimum reserves even gives the Eurosys-
tem an advantage over financial centres with-
out the instrument of minimum reserves.
Since minimum reserves are to be maintained
on a monthly average, are remunerated at
market rates and, at the same time, can also
be used as working balances for interbank
payments, this means not only that the
amount of liquidity required by the banking
system for future open market transactions is
measured constantly, but that, in effect,
working balances are even remunerated at
market rates.Retail payments at the Bundesbank
Retail payments – which include, in particular,
everyday cashless payments made by non-
banks (households, public administrations
and enterprises) – are characterised by a high
volume of payments of a fairly limited
value and which are less urgent. On average,
9.9 million such payments with a total value
of around 39.5 billion were transacted on
average per day via the Bundesbank in the
second half of 2008. At the forefront are
efforts to keep costs low while ensuring safe
settlement and minimising processing times.
In Germany, the debit card (a bank customer
card with which the account is debited one
to two days later – used in 1.7 billion transac-
tions in 2007) is the only other major retail
payment instrument alongside the credit
transfer and the direct debit. The chart and
table on pages 61 and 63 list the uses of
payment instruments in Germany and other
selected countries. An international compari-
son of the number of transactions per capita
shows that, in Germany, credit card usage is
not particularly widespread.
In domestic retail payments (which account
for around 55 million transactions settled on
average each day), credit institutions ex-
change electronic payment messages using
central institutions and association members’
computer centres (“bilateral interbank clear-
ing”). At the end, only the respective gross
amounts are settled via these institutions’ ac-
counts with the Bundesbank. This means that
around 85% of the total transaction volume
is settled directly between banks. The remain-
ing 15% of retail payments are settled via theEffective

62Bundesbank’s “Retail Payment System” (RPS).
In 1991, the number of retail payments trans-
acted via the Bundesbank peaked at just
under 3.2 billion. After the Bundesbank, in a
countermeasure, began to charge a fee for
this service, the volume of transactions fell
somewhat and, since 1995, has remained vir-
tually constant, at around 2.3 billion trans-
actions per year. This represents a reduction
in market share by more than half from the
Bundesbank’s 1991 figure of nearly 35%. The
Bundesbank’s complementary role means
that it is not in competition with the banking
industry. Households and enterprises are not
permitted to hold accounts with the Bundes-
bank. Therefore, besides domestic credit insti-
tutions, the only other parties eligible to hold
Bundesbank accounts are public sector bod-
ies (for which the Bundesbank acts as a “fis-
cal agent”), cash handling service providers,
foreign credit institutions and international
organisations.
A central bank has different motives for par-
ticipating in retail payments than for being in-
volved in individual payments. The Bundes-
bank’s giro network enables all banks, but
particularly those without any group affili-
ation, to offer payment services without
being at a competitive disadvantage. Every in-
stitution can reach every other institution for
inbound and outbound payments via the
Bundesbank. The Bundesbank, however, is
also, in principle, ready to use the systems
and processes of its infrastructure to close, at
least partly, gaps caused by a technological
failure afflicting parts of the banking industry.The process of economic and monetary inte-
gration has likewise had a sustained impact
on developments in retail payments in the
past few years. In addition to EU Standard
Credit Transfers,14since 28 January 2008 it
has also been possible to use SEPA (Single
Euro Payments Area) credit transfers to send
cross-border retail payments to other Euro-
pean countries. The European Commission
had previously already adopted a regulation
ensuring that the fee charged for cross-
border payments within Europe was no high-
er than the corresponding national charge.15
The SEPA direct debit is scheduled to follow
as of November 2009. The guiding idea is
that this new SEPA format for credit transfers
and direct debits will, following a changeover
period, completely replace the existing na-
tional formats and procedures rather than
complement them. Following a changeover
period that has yet to be determined, domes-
tic payments effected by credit transfer or dir-
ect debit are also to be settled exclusively in
the SEPA format. SEPA is the logical result of
the Single Market and the introduction of the
euro. The more competitive and efficient pay-
ment market that will be created is expected
to deliver corresponding benefits to the finan-
cial sector, the real economy and consumers.
14 Payments in accordance with Regulation (EC)
No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 19 December 2001 on cross-border payments
in euro.
15The introduction of the International Bank Account
Number (IBAN) and the use of the Bank Identifier Code
(BIC) have made it easier to settle cross-border payments.
The IBAN has made it possible to offset the vast differ-
ences across the Union in the systems used to assign
bank account numbers. The BIC, an eight to eleven-digit
alphanumeric code, is ultimately a bank’s “address” in
SWIFT, which is internationally identifiable by all credit in-
stitutions.Reasons why

63In the long term, national stand-alone solu-
tions are not compatible with the Single Mar-
ket and the euro. The continued parallel exist-
ence of previous formats and processes
means that not enough is being done to
make full use of the options provided by SEPA
for cross-border competition and cost reduc-
tion. It is precisely past experience which
demonstrates that the courage to innovate
– combined with the willingness to fund the
necessary financial outlays – will pay off in
the long run.
Payment systems and monetary policy
Developments in cashless payments can dis-
cernibly influence the execution of monetary
policy. Reference has already been made tointerbank payments – ie individual or large-
value payments (TARGET, TARGET2) – regard-
ing their importance for efficient money mar-
ket management and for standardised money
market conditions. Changes in non-banks’
behaviour in retail payments, especially as a
result of innovations and new terms and con-
ditions or fees, can also impact on monetary
indicators. The substitution of cash with de-
posit money is the best example. The demand
for central bank money resulting from public
demand for cash, minimum reserve require-
ments and the voluntary holding of working
balances for interbank payments on central
bank accounts is a key factor in the success
of central banks in managing money market
rates. Any changes in the demand for central
bank money caused by, for instance, innov-
ation in payment instruments have to beUse of payment instruments by non-banks in selected countries
