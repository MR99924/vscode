5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeGrowth in the German economy faltered in
the third quarter of 2004. According to Fed-eral Statistical Office figures, overall outputincreased by only 0.1% on the quarter afteradjustment for seasonal and working-dayvariations. This compared with a second-quarter figure of +0.4%. The main reason forthis was the fall in exports of just over 1% inseasonally adjusted terms. The external tradesituation was made worse by the fact that, atthe same time, imports increased by 4
1/C254%. It
is entirely possible that, in some cases, im-ports led to a build-up of inventories, espe-cially of intermediate goods which were in in-creased demand. In any case, in the thirdquarter, stocks went back up again for thefirst time in some while. In addition, therewas increased domestic spending on machin-ery and equipment. After working-day andseasonal adjustment, there was an increaseof just over 4%. Here, too, imports are likelyto have played an important role. This con-trasted with construction investment, wherethe decline continued. At a seasonally adjust-ed -
3/C254%, however, the decline was much
smaller than in the first half of the year. Over-all, fixed investment went up by around1
1/C254%. Households continued to show re-
straint in consumer spending. After seasonaladjustment, spending in the third quarter wasno higher than in the preceding months. Thefaster pace of inflation and the continuingunfavourable labour market situation had anadverse impact.GDP

6Industry
In industry, which had been feeling the ef-
fects of a noticeable lull in the summermonths, the situation improved again in Oc-tober. Both orders received and productionrecovered in seasonally adjusted terms aftertwo fairly weak months prior to that. Therewas an increase in orders of around 1% com-pared with the third quarter. At constantprices and after working-day adjustment,there was a year-on-year rise of 3
3/C254%. It was
only domestic demand that increased. Themain demand was for motor vehicles, com-puters and telecommunications equipment.By contrast, export orders fell slightly bothmonth-on-month and compared with thethird quarter.Output in October was almost 1% higher
than the September figure in seasonally ad-justed terms and was
1/C252% up on the average
of the third quarter as a whole. There was ayear-on-year rise of just under 3%. The high-er output was concentrated on capital goods.The motor industry was a focal point, al-though production of machinery and equip-ment also expanded sharply.
ConstructionDevelopments in the construction industry re-
mained very subdued throughout the report-ing period. Although construction orders sta-bilised at a low level in the third quarter, pro-duction may have decreased at the beginningof the fourth quarter. However, there is noprecise evidence for this at present. Accord-ing to the official statistics, output was actu-ally somewhat higher in October than in theprevious month. However, an upward adjust-ment has to be expected for this followingthis year’s overall survey. If the adjustment ismore or less just as large as in previous years,the level reached in October would be belowthe final September figure.
In September (more recent statistics are un-
available at present), new construction orderswere somewhat down on the month in sea-sonally adjusted terms. However, August hadbeen quite good, with the result that, in theperiod from July to September as a whole,the level of new orders matched that of thesecond quarter. This is almost equally true ofall the construction subsectors, ranging fromresidential and industrial construction to pub-lic sector construction. Compared with theGrowth of the economy as a whole

7previous year, all sectors continued to show a
marked decline.
Labour marketThe labour market situation remained un-
favourable. According to Federal StatisticalOffice data, the rise in the number of em-ployed persons, which was recorded in thefirst half of the year, particularly in the case oflow-paid part-time jobs and one-person busi-nesses, did not continue at the end of sum-mer. In seasonally adjusted terms, just asmany persons were in work in September asin the previous month (38.39 million). Theyear-on-year increase rose only marginally to110,000.
At the same time, unemployment went up
steadily, albeit on a slower path, at the end ofthe period under review. The seasonally ad-justed number of persons officially registeredas unemployed stood at 4.46 million in No-vember, which is equivalent to 10.8% of theworkforce. As defined by international stand-ards, the unemployment rate was 9.9%. Ac-cording to the labour exchanges, the numberof persons affected rose by 74,000 comparedwith the previous year. Taking into accountthe statistical change in the field of aptitudetesting and training schemes, the increaseamounts to 208,000. In October, the figurewas around 20,000 persons fewer in eachcase.

8quoted for Brent North Sea Oil stood at
slightly over US$50 per barrel at the end ofOctober, falling to US$40 by mid-December.Even though this means that oil becamearound one-fifth cheaper on the Europeanspot markets, the price has still gone up byone-third on the year. Owing to US dollar de-preciation on the foreign exchange markets,the price rise in euro terms was only just overone-fifth.
The fall in oil prices had a noticeable impact
on consumer prices. In seasonally adjustedterms, the price index declined again in No-vember and almost completely offset the pre-vious month’s rise, which had been largelydue to the steep increase in the cost of petroland heating oil. The year-on-year rate of in-crease went down from 2.0% in October to1.8% in November. This meant that it wasjust as high again as on an average of thethird quarter. Excluding the group of energysources, which includes gas and electricity aswell as refined petroleum products, pricemovements remained within narrow boundsin November. In seasonally adjusted terms,there was no more than a slight rise of 0.1%;at 1.4%, the year-on-year rate of increasewas scarcely higher than before.
Public finances
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
In October net borrowing by central, state
and local government amounted to a sizeable312.8 billion, after 38.0 billion had been re-deemed on balance in September, a month
of major tax payments. However, this was ac-companied by a large increase in money mar-ket deposits by central government in Octo-ber amounting to 38.2 billion. Central gov-
ernment borrowed 312.7 billion in October,
of which 30.9 billion was raised on the
money market and 311.8 billion on the cap-
ital market. The primary financing vehicle wasan increase of 37.7 billion in the outstanding
volume of two-year Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze). The topping-up of the Septemberissue was 32 billion higher than had been an-
ticipated in the annual issuance plan. Theyield on the top-up securities fell by 14 basispoints compared with the original issue inSeptember to 2.46%. The outstanding vol-ume of five-year Federal notes (Bobls) rose by34.7 billion; the main source of this was theNet borrowing in the market

August. The yield on this issue declined by10 basis points to 3.31%.
State government increased its liabilities only
marginally in October (+ 30.3 billion). The
amount of outstanding loans against borrow-ers’ notes rose by 31.5 billion in total, where-
as cash advances were lowered by 30.9 bil-
lion. The volume of circulating Treasury notesdecreased slightly (- 30.2 billion). Of gross bor-
rowing in this category (+ 31.4 billion), 31 bil-
lion alone was attributable to a jumbo bondwith a 4% coupon and a ten-year maturity is-sued by the federal state of Hesse. In the caseof those special funds not integrated intocentral government debt, the outstandingvolume of loans granted to the German UnityFund against borrowers’ notes fell slightly by30.2 billion. Local government indebtedness
appears to have marginally increased again inOctober.
Central government borrowingIn November the Federal Government re-
duced its total indebtedness by 36.8 billion.
The redemption of money market loans ac-counted for 35.3 billion of this drop. Capital
market liabilities were cut by 31.5 billion on
balance. However, central government alsosharply reduced its deposits on the moneymarket by 38.5 billion. In terms of actual cash
inflow, net new borrowing between Januaryand November reached a total of 352.6 bil-
lion. The original budgetary estimate of329.3 billion for net borrowing was raised to
343.5 billion in the 2004 supplementary
budget. In view of the usually relatively fa-vourable cash balance in December, the out-
standing privatisation proceeds and remain-ing money market deposits, this target seemsto be within reach.
The Federal Government’s gross borrowing
on the capital market amounted to 316.4 bil-
lion in November. The largest individual itemwas the issue of a ten-year Federal bond(Bund) with an allotment volume of 36.5 bil-
lion and a 3.75% coupon. Compared withthe maturing Bund issued in November 1994,which still carried an interest rate of 7.5%,central government thus this time obtainedmuch cheaper financing. Redemptions andsignificant purchases in the context of marketmanagement operations pushed down theoutstanding amount of Bunds marginally by30.2 billion.

10discount paper (Bubills) raised 35.4 billion.
The volume of Bubills in circulation decreasedby30.5 billion owing to even higher repay-
ments. In the case of Bobls, 34.5 billion was
raised by the further topping up of the Au-gust issue. Compared with the previousmonth’s top-up operation, the yield on theissue fell again considerably by 27 basispoints to 3.04%. The outstanding volume ofBobls went down by 31.7 billion due to the
redemption of a series issued in 1999 with a4.25% coupon and current transactions. Bycontrast, the amount of outstanding two-year Sch/C228tze rose by 31.1 billion owing to
market management operations.
Securities markets
Bond marketAt395.1 billion, issuing activity in the Ger-
man bond market in October was 310 billion
down on the previous month. The lower levelof redemptions and changes in issuers’ hold-ings of their own bonds nonetheless meantthat net sales of debt securities issued by do-mestic borrowers went up from 30.3 billion in
September to 36.8 billion. Sales of foreign
bonds in Germany raised 38.8 billion net,
compared with 36.6 billion in the previous
month. The sale of domestic and foreign debtsecurities thus generated a total of 315.6 bil-
lion (September: 36.9 billion).
Most of the funds raised accrued to the pub-
lic sector. After having reduced its bondeddebt by 38.3 billion in September, it now
increased its bond market liabilities by310.2 billion net. The main individual bond
issuer was the Federal Government, whichplaced 312.7 billion worth of bonds. Of this
amount, 37.7 billion was raised from sales of
two-year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) and34.6 billion from sales of five-year Federal
notes (Bobls). Treasury discount paper(Bubills) worth 30.6 billion was redeemed. In
the longer-term market segment, 30.7 billion
worth of ten-year Federal bonds and 30.2 bil-
lion worth of thirty-year Federal bonds wereplaced as part of price regulation operations.The federal states again raised funds in thebond market during the month under review(31.2 billion, following 32.7 billion in Septem-
ber). The redemption for a total of 33.7 bil-
lion of two bonds originally issued by the for-mer Deutsche Bundespost reduced the vol-ume outstanding of bonds issued by the vari-ous public sector special funds to 32.3 billion.
Five years ago the volume outstanding of thiskind of paper was 3163 billion. However, the
special funds have ceased using their owndebt securities to generate resources but,owing to the more favourable financingterms, are now operating jointly with theFederal Government.
The volume outstanding of debt securities is-
sued by domestic non-financial enterpriseswent up by 31.7 billion in October, following
net redemptions amounting to 33.7 billion in
the previous month. The volume of commer-cial paper outstanding fell by 31.3 billion in
the month under review, while the volume oflonger-term corporate bonds outstanding in-creased by 33.0 billion.

11Credit institutions redeemed 35.1 billion net
worth of bonds, after issuing 312.3 billion
net of such paper in September. The volumeoutstanding of public Pfandbriefe, which hasbeen shrinking since 2000, decreased againin October, this time by 39.1 billion. For the
first time since the start of the year, the vol-ume of other bank debt securities outstand-ing also decreased (- 31.2 billion). Issues by
special purpose credit institutions raised 34.9
billion net of resources and issues of mort-gage Pfandbriefe raised 30.3 billion net.
On balance, bonds issued in the month under
review were purchased primarily by foreigninvestors, which added 318.5 billion worth of
German bonds to their portfolios. In the pre-vious month they had returned 31.2 billion
worth of paper. They invested two-thirds ofthese resources in public sector bonds andone-third in private sector bonds. Germancredit institutions purchased 37.5 billion
worth of bonds in all (September: 39.2 bil-
lion), showing a distinct preference for for-eign paper ( 312.6 billion). As far as domestic
paper was concerned, they restricted theirpurchases to public sector bonds ( 30.6 bil-
lion), selling 34.2 billion of bank bonds and
31.5 billion of corporate bonds. As in the pre-
vious months, domestic non-banks reducedtheir bond portfolios. They sold 36.6 billion
worth of domestic debt securities and 33.9
billion worth of foreign paper.
Equity marketAt31.6 billion, there was a clear upturn in
German equity issuance. However, this issolely attributable to a public sector bank’scapital increase. Sales of foreign equities gen-
erated 31.4 billion, taking the overall volume
of funds raised to 33.1 billion. On balance,
the only purchasers were from the domesticmarket, with credit institutions favouring do-mestic shares ( 31.7 billion) and non-banks
foreign paper ( 31.2 billion). After purchasing
33.1 billion worth of shares in September,
foreign investors purchased, on balance, noGerman shares in the month under review.
Mutual fund sharesDomestic mutual funds recorded outflows of
31.5 billion in October. Funds open to the
general public bought back shares worth 31.7

12funds (- 31.5 billion) were most affected by the
decline in investor interest but shares in bond-based and mixed funds were also redeemed(-30.7 billion and - 30.1 billion respectively). By
contrast, share-based funds and open-endreal estate funds recorded inflows of 30.3 bil-
lion and 30.2 respectively. In the case of open-
end real estate funds, however, it should benoted that the parent company of at least onefund added returned shares to its own port-folio. The amount outstanding of foreign mu-tual fund shares in the German market in-creased by 30.2 billion in the month under re-
view (September: 31.6 billion).
On balance, credit institutions were the sole
purchasers of fund shares in October; they in-vested 30.8 billion in domestic mutual fund
shares and 30.2 billion in foreign mutual fund
shares. Domestic non-banks and foreign in-vestors returned shares amounting to 31.4
billion and 30.9 billion respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus of 36.9 billion in October. This increase
of31.5 billion on September was partly due
to the decrease in the deficit on invisible cur-rent transactions, which comprise services,factor income and current transfers. Thetrade surplus also increased.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the trade surplus roseby30.5 billion on the month to 312.5 billion
in October. After adjustment for seasonalvariations, the trade balance, also at 312.5billion, was up slightly on the previous
month’s level as exports of goods increasedsomewhat more sharply than imports ofgoods. In seasonally adjusted terms, exportsin October were just over 1% up on Septem-ber while the growth in imports was a littleunder 1%. Taking August, September andOctober together, although seasonally adjust-ed exports slightly exceeded the very positiveresult of the previous three-month period, inreal terms there was no increase. In a three-month comparison, the value of imports roseby 3%. The rise in import prices accountedfor just over one-third of this growth.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
amounted to 35.0 billion in October, having
reached 35.7 billion in September. This de-
cline in the deficit was primarily attributableto the increase in net factor income, whichrose on balance by 30.4 billion to 31.4 billion.
In addition, the deficit on services went downby30.2 billion to just below 34.0 billion. Net
expenditure on current transfers also fellslightly. It stood at 32.4 billion in October
compared with 32.6 billion in the previous
month.
In October, portfolio investment resulted in
net capital imports whereas in September netoutflows of funds had been recorded (+ 37.2
billion compared with - 33.2 billion). The main
reason behind this reversal was the fact thatforeign investors increased their portfolio ex-posure in Germany ( 317.7 billion against 31.4
billion in September) more sharply than Ger-man investors increased their exposureabroad. Non-residents’ increased interest wasfocused on German bonds and notes ( 315.6

13billion in October compared with 34.7 billion
in the previous month), notably on public-sector paper. Foreign investors also extendedtheir holdings of money market paper ( 32.9
billion), having sold these types of security inSeptember (- 35.8 billion). By contrast, their
shareholdings in Germany remained un-changed on balance. German residents in-vested funds amounting to 310.4 billion in
foreign securities (compared with 34.5 billion
in September). The outflow of funds was pri-marily attributable to the purchase of foreignbonds ( 39.9 billion), with domestic investors
restricting themselves almost exclusively tothe purchase of bonds denominated in euro.In addition, they added foreign shares to theirsecurities portfolios ( 31.4 billion) and sold
money market paper ( 31.1 billion).
Direct investment again resulted in net capital
exports ( 33.3 billion) in October. Foreign pro-
prietors withdrew 32.4 billion from Germany.
This was mainly due to the redemption ofloans which foreign investors had grantedtheir German subsidiaries in the past. By con-trast, they increased their investment capitalin Germany ( 31.4 billion). German enterprises
increased their foreign exposure only slightlyin October ( 30.9 billion). Alongside injections
of investment capital, the provision of loansalso played a minor role in this.
The statistically recorded non-securitised
credit transactions of non-banks were in bal-ance in October. The activities of enterprisesand individuals led to outflows of funds ( 31.4
billion) while the financial operations of gen-eral government resulted in equal inflows offunds. The cross-border credit operations ofMajor items of the balance

15Demographic burdens
on growth and
wealth in GermanyThe economic repercussions of a con-
tinuously ageing population are amongthe key economic and social policychallenges facing modern industrial so-ciety. Although Germany is not alonein this, it is one of the countries mostaffected by demographic changes –significantly more than the UnitedStates, France or the United Kingdom,for example. The first adjustmentmeasures have already been initiatedin various areas in which – as in the caseof the retirement pension schemes –the implications for fundability havebecome evident. There is still muchuncertainty, however, concerning thewider ramifications of the problemand the resultant adjustment require-ments.
This article aims to remedy this at least
to a certain extent. It first describesthe emerging demographic trends andtheir foreseeable repercussions for eco-nomic growth. Subsequently, it out-lines several economic policy optionswhich may help to counteract theotherwise threatening burdens.

16which have no precise historical parallel. The
reason for this is the combination of a declin-ing or persistently low birth rate and rising lifeexpectancy, both of which have been domin-ating the natural pattern of the populationfor around three decades. On balance, themost recent population forecast up to 2050in its “medium variant” assumes a decline inthe number of people living in Germany fromthe present figure of around 82 million toaround 75 million.
2It assumes that life ex-
pectancy at birth will increase by around sixyears, that the life expectancy of a 60-yearold will go up by some 4
1/C252years and that
there will be a migration surplus of around200,000 people each year. Other assump-tions regarding life expectancy and the migra-tion balance actually indicate a populationdecline to 67 million people. Only a high levelof immigration and a sharp rise in life expect-ancy will keep the projected decline in popu-lation size up to 2050 within relatively narrowbounds.
From an economic viewpoint, the demo-
graphic problem over the longer term is at-tributable less to the emerging decline in theoverall population than to the permanentshift in the age structure of the populationand the relative contraction of the potentiallabour force, which will largely occur be-tween 2015 and 2030. A declining or per-manently low birth rate and a higher life ex-pectancy will result in the elderly dependencyratio (the ratio of pensioners to those ofworking age) rising to an unprecedented levelfrom currently 44% to almost 78% in 2050.An average effective retirement age of 60 isassumed, while the group of people of work-ing age is defined as those aged between
20 and 59. On the other hand, the share ofpeople not yet of working age (under20 years) will decline, which means that the“overall dependency ratio” (the ratio of allpersons not of working age to those of work-ing age) will go up from 82% today to 112%by the end of the forecast period. This in-crease is only a little less pronounced than thesimultaneous change in the elderly depend-ency ratio. On average over the next few dec-ades, each person of working age will haveto support an increasing number of citizenswho are not of working age.
However, such forecasts are subject to con-
siderable uncertainty. Although experiencehas shown that key determinants of popula-tion growth change only very slowly, the mi-gration pattern is a major source of uncer-tainty. Another is the long forecast horizon;even small changes in the assumptions couldlead to considerable deviations over such along period of time. This is one of the reasonswhy the coordinated population projectionalways present several variants.
Even if demographic forecasts thus have the
character of a model, it would be highly neg-ligent not to take the core implications of thecurrently available forecasts seriously. Inaccur-ate population forecasts in the past weremainly attributable to exogenous, abruptchanges, such as the slump in the birth ratedue to the contraceptive pill or the political

cesses and events are not usually predictable.Furthermore, experience shows that forecastsconcerning the age structure tend to be moreaccurate than predictions about the size ofthe population or its spatial distribution.
Implications for growth and wealth
In order to study the repercussions of the
demographic change, it is useful to first pin-point the other underlying conditions and todiscuss the likely implications for the econ-omy based on this scenario. This is not aneconomic analysis in the strict sense since nei-ther market nor policy reactions are included.However, such a projection can make sensein order to highlight the likely risks if the eco-nomic policy status quo were to be retainedor if only minor policy changes were to bemade.
Under status quo conditions, the labour sup-
ply in Germany would decline relativelysharply. Given unchanged conditions con-cerning the development of the capital stockand its utilisation as well as technical pro-gress, potential macroeconomic outputwould also increase less steeply or even de-crease. According to the medium variant ofthe tenth coordinated population forecast upto 2050, the number of people aged be-tween 20 and 59 – which presumably willcontinue to constitute the majority of the la-bour force in the future – will fall by an an-nual average of
1/C252%. Assuming that this de-
cline has a full impact on the production fac-tor labour, the trend rate of GDP , given a pro-duction elasticity of two-thirds, will decline by
a computed annual average of
1/C253percentage
point. Per capita income, which is often usedas a rough measure of the general standardof living in an economy, would also fall. Itshould also be borne in mind that besides theabove-mentioned direct effects that a deteri-oration in the age structure of the workingpopulation will have on output, additional in-direct factors will also play a role, which mayconsiderably magnify the overall effect. Thusaccount needs to be taken of the fact thattechnical progress and the process of struc-tural transformation will be slower or lesssmooth if an ageing society is less innovativeand mobile. Moreover, the burden on the fac-tor labour from social security contributions islikely to increase further,
4which may also
lead to social frictions.
Economic policy options
The highlighted demographic trends have
been evident for a long time and are virtuallyirreversible. Even major adjustments in thebirth rate would not be sufficient to stop theageing process of the next two to three dec-ades. The demographic challenge now is tofind timely, appropriate economic and socialpolicy answers for the economic risks andburdens resulting from demographic change.

19A key aim should be to strengthen the foun-
dations for economic growth in the next tenyears in such a way as to absorb as far as pos-sible the “demographic burdens” which willbegin to make themselves felt by then.
An effective way of counteracting the demo-
graphically induced deterioration would be toextend the effective working life. This meanseither raising working hours during the phaseof employment or adjusting the length of theactive working life. This includes raising thestatutory minimum age for claiming a pen-sion in line with the increase in life expect-ancy and introducing appropriate benefit cutsfor taking early retirement.
5It is also particu-
larly important to make the incentive struc-tures more employment-friendly. On the onehand, this concerns the various forms of pre-mature retirement and, on the other, the em-ployment disincentives for retirement pensionrecipients. The inference that people are retir-ing comparatively early nowadays is evidentfrom the fact that there is a relatively low em-ployment rate of persons aged between55 and 64. Among the OECD countries,which in 2003 had an average labour marketparticipation rate of 53% in this age group,Germany is in the bottom third with a rate of43%. This is almost 7 percentage pointslower than the level in 1970.
Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that in
many areas the number of hours worked dur-ing the working life is rather low both byinternational standards and compared withhistorical levels in Germany. This is particularlythe case when the new EU member states areincluded and the focus is on annual workinghours, ie incorporating negotiated annual
holidays. Of the 25 EU countries, only theNetherlands, Denmark and France fare worsethan Germany. With regard to the workingtime component it would doubtless be in-appropriate to lay down rigid, general re-quirements; this would be just as inappropri-ate as the previous general shortening ofworking hours. More flexibility and the cor-rection of employment-hostile incentivestructures would, however, be meaningful inview of the looming problems.
In attempting to mitigate the demographic
problems, another option would be to morevigorously activate the potential of the work-Year-on-year change since 1970

20ing population, ie to reduce the inactivity
rate. One possibility would be to streamlinethe education and training process and short-en its duration, especially since the age forcommencing employment has gone up sig-nificantly in Germany in recent decades andthe traditional edge which Germany had inlabour force participation among the 15-24age group has meanwhile been completelyeroded. Whereas in 1970, 70% of residentsaged 15-24 were working, this figure hadfallen to only 47
1/C252% in 2003. The OECD
country average for this age group is, admit-tedly, likewise only one in two people. Thefrontrunner is currently the Netherlands witha participation rate of 71%.
It is possible that the necessary adjustment to
the demographic change may occur voluntar-ily to some extent if young people leave the
education and training system earlier owingto the demographically induced reduction inthe labour supply and a correspondingly im-proved vocational outlook. Even so, a politicalinitiative aimed at shortening the duration ofeducation and training in Germany – whichby international comparison is fairly long –would certainly also be helpful. Allowing uni-versities to freely select their students neednot result in a loss of educational quality. Inaddition, the participation rate of women inthe German labour force is still relatively lowcompared with other countries. This is cer-tainly associated with the lack of childcare fa-cilities and the traditional perception of thewoman’s role in the family. Expanding child-care facilities in line with requirements wouldcertainly make it easier to reconcile work andfamily life. Furthermore, models need to bedeveloped to enable women to smoothly re-enter the labour market following a period ofchild-rearing.
However, the approaches outlined above are
not capable of providing a quick fix to thisproblem. Experience shows that the correc-tion of incentive structures takes a long timeand only gradually acquires a broader impact.However, these are important factors forshaping the future, with a signalling characterwhich should not be underestimated.
An even more urgent and vital task is redu-
cing the high structural unemployment. Ac-cording to a broad consensus of estimates,this entrenched type of unemployment con-stitutes the largest part of overall unemploy-ment in Germany. For example, the OECD es-%

21timates for 2004 that some three-quarters of
overall unemployment was non-cyclical. Ger-many’s labour market development also faresbadly compared with other EU countries.
A reduction in the labour supply for demo-
graphic reasons does not necessarily result ina lower unemployment rate. It ultimately de-pends on how sharply wage demands reactand on the wage elasticity of real wages. Fur-thermore, it is to be feared that the high andfurther rising contributions to the social se-curity systems will widen the wedge betweengross and net income, thus tending to reducethe degree of employment. Any politicalmeasure which lowers the high non-wagelabour costs in Germany is suitable for allevi-ating this problem.
In the last few years both the social partners
and the legislators have taken a series ofmeasures aimed at increasing the labour mar-ket’s flexibility and improving its ability tofunction.
6Additional corrections must follow.
One area for consideration in this context isthat employment protection legislation great-ly impinges on firms’ recruitment policy.Furthermore, the “favourability principle”,which only allows deviations from the collect-ive labour agreement if they are in the em-ployees’ best interests, should be morebroadly interpreted to include job-saving as-pects. This must be accompanied, as planned,by further narrowing the tax wedge on thelabour market. The individual freedom ofcontract for both employees and employersshould be enhanced in the process.Another question is what effect the ageing of
the population will have on structural un-employment. On the one hand, there couldbe a larger segment of people who gainedtheir qualifications and skills many years be-fore and whose knowledge and experiencehave become increasingly “outdated” evengiven a merely moderate rate of technicalprogress. A combination of low mobility andhigh vocational requirements could also pushup mismatch unemployment. Compensatorydevelopments must also be taken into ac-count, however. For example, vocationaltraining will become more worthwhile forsome individuals if the size of the labour forcecontracts. Historical experience also indicates1991 = 100, log scale

22that immigrants often fill the niches in the la-
bour market. Finally there is the possibility ofoffering person-related services as a comple-ment to the general productivity progress.The compensatory factors will naturally havea greater impact if the structures on the la-bour market can be made more flexible withthe help of wage policy and legislative meas-ures and if the loss in value of human capitalcan be countered by popularising and imple-menting the principle of life-long learning.The observation that the incentive to invest inenhancing one’s own human capital tends todecrease with age is presumably related tothe (often only short) remaining working life.A longer working life, and therefore an ex-tended amortisation period for such newlyacquired knowledge, would increase the re-turn on training investment and thus boostthe incentive to relearn and retrain among
older people, too.
If it is assumed that one of the key problems
of demographic change lies not only in its ef-fects on per capita income but also its effectson the growth rate of overall output, the op-tion of immigration should not be ignored.Labour market-oriented migration could curbthe demographic trend.
7For example, a con-
tracting (working) population will tend to in-crease the economic incentive of migrating toGermany. At the same time, however, thepolitical framework must be adjusted accord-ingly. Germany is facing not only locationalcompetition for mobile real capital but alsoincreasing competition for a skilled workforceand human capital. This also requires, how-ever, that the concrete design of the immigra-tion rules – such as the level of a possible im-migration quota or the qualitative criteria andintegration measures – ensures that immigra-tion will not overburden the social securitysystems.
The perfect solution would doubtless be to
cope with the consequences of demographicchange at least partly by raising the product-ivity rate of labour, be it by increasing labourefficiency or by equipping workplaces withmore fixed capital. For many years, labourproductivity has been in Germany, as else-where, the most important source forstrengthening aggregate potential output.However, that source has trended down-%

23Saving behaviour in an ageing economy
Attempts are often made to explain private saving
and consumption behaviour on the basis of the life-cycle hypothesis,
1according to which the house-
hold decides at the beginning of its life cycle howmuch it wishes to consume or save in each period.This takes account of the expected income path at agiven real interest rate and the initial financial en-dowment. Under the assumption of certaintyequivalence, that is if uncertainty is disregarded,the optimising household strives to achieve con-stant consumption over time.
2
By contrast, more recent precautionary savingsmodels abandon the assumption of certaintyequivalence and explicitly factor in uncertainty con-cerning labour income.
3In these models individuals
save both for their retirement and to hedge againstpossible losses of income in times of recession. Un-certainty about future income is particularly high inthe case of young people with a long expectationhorizon. It can theoretically be demonstrated thatif precautionary motives are taken into account inan extended life cycle model, this does not lead to asteady increase but rather to a u-shaped savingratio profile during the working life and dissavingslows down with age.
4Empirical studies, however,
indicate that negative saving in old age is almostnon-existent in most industrialised countries.
5This
is probably also due to significant bequeathing mo-tives and a declining consumption capacity in veryold age.
6
The reasons behind the ageing process are also animportant factor in saving behaviour over time. Pur-suant to the life-cycle hypothesis, the householdsector’s aggregate saving ratio initially rises as thebirth rate drops. First, the consumption require-ments of young families fall and, moreover, thehousehold income may be greater if women areworking. Second, in an ageing economy with astatutory pension system based on the pay-as-you-go principle with constant contribution rates,young people will expand their own private pen-sion provisions in order to, at least partly, compen-
sate for the expected lower pension. The positiveimpact of larger-scale saving by young people is off-set by the negative impact of the older generation’slower saving ratio. If the pronounced ageing of thepopulation continues, the negative impact willpredominate and consequently the aggregate pri-vate saving ratio will fall.
The industrial countries’ economies are ageing not
only as a result of falling or low birth rates but alsobecause of rising life expectancy. The impact of arising life expectancy on the household saving ratiohas been examined in recent publications.
7The re-
sults show that a rising life expectancy is having apositive effect on the current saving ratio.
8This is
also the case for future saving ratios. The savingratio rises – according to the basic line of reasoning –for two reasons: firstly because of the longer life ex-pectancy and secondly because of the uncertaintyassociated with increased life expectancy. Econo-metric analyses confirm this finding.
In the case of saving or consumption, age, cohort
and time effects generally overlap. An age effectcharacterises behaviour patterns typical of a certainage group. Cohort effects reflect behaviour pat-terns of persons born in specific years. Temporal ormacroeconomic effects represent behaviour pat-terns which can be traced back to certain events orcircumstances. These three aspects can be differen-tiated using the Deaton-Paxson decomposition.
9
B/C246rsch-Supan, Reil-Held and Schnabel carried outcorresponding studies for Germany.
10They found
that the saving ratio in all cohorts of the mediumage group (ie the age group between 30 and50 years) is quite stable at approximately 12%. Inthe later stages of life, however, there is an initialsharp decline in the propensity to save before it sta-bilises at about 4 to 5%. Thus, even in very old agethe population does not dissave but rather con-tinues to accumulate assets.

24wards significantly. The fact that the speed
and nature of technical progress are by nomeans determined exogenously is demon-strated not only by the noticeably large differ-ences in the standard of living between in-dustrial countries, emerging markets anddeveloping countries. Within the group ofOECD countries, too, there are marked differ-entials which in some cases widened furtherduring the 1990s.
8These cannot be ex-
plained solely by the fact that less wealthycountries need a longer convergence processin order to gradually catch up with the richercountries. The USA and Canada as well asAustralia, the Netherlands and Norway alsoshowed an impressive track record. Germanyoccupies a position in the lower reaches ofthe league table; moreover, a considerablepart of the productivity gains was achieved atthe expense of the employment rate. In theeuro area, the higher employment growthwas accompanied by a slowing of the prod-uctivity rate, whereas in the USA, employ-ment and productivity gains went hand inhand in the second half of the 1990s.
The effects of ageing on the growth rate of
total factor productivity are not clear from atheoretical point of view. Thus it is plausible,albeit not absolutely demonstrated, that riskpropensity and mobility decline with age andthat therefore in an older population fewerrisky investments and innovations will bemade. The burdens on public finances mayalso result in considerable increases in taxesand social security contributions. The result-ant distortions of relative prices lead to effi-ciency losses, which curb the rise of total fac-tor productivity.On the other hand, cross-section studies
often indicate rising wages with age. Assum-ing a close correlation between wages andproductivity, this would mean that olderpeople are more productive than youngerpeople, either because human capital in-creases with experience over the course ofthe working life or owing to training meas-ures. On this view, total factor productivitymay increase above the normal level as longas the proportion of older people in the work-ing population goes up. Finally, a growingshortage of labour and the associated in-crease in wages could also intensify thesearch for labour-saving innovations. It isclear, however, that the problems associatedwith ageing can be only partially offset by anendogenous rise in total factor productivity.
For this reason, too, a comprehensive
response to the challenges of future demo-graphic burdens must be oriented primarily toinvestment and a higher capital intensity. Afrequent counterargument to this is that inan ageing society, household saving declines.This leaves fewer internal resources availableto be invested. Growth weakens accordingly.However, the suggested correlation betweenageing and national savings is not clear-cuteven in theory (see box on page 23). Al-though empirical studies tend to suggest anegative influence of an “old” age structureon saving, the quantitative estimates differconsiderably.

overall national saving can be counteractedusing economic policy measures. Besides a

Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that atthe international level the degree of capitalmobility is very high. The main reason for thisis the relative locational attractiveness of thecompeting economies. If German enterprisescan continue to offer high returns, as a resultof their innovative capacities or their technicalknowledge, despite the demographic bur-dens, domestic saving capital will not flowabroad and foreign capital formation couldadditionally support the growth of the do-mestic capital stock. Attempts must thereforebe made to make Germany a more attractiveinvestment location. Fixed capital formationin Germany has evidently become consider-ably less attractive than investment abroad(including German financial investmentabroad). At any rate, there has been a slumpin investment in Germany on a broad front inthe last few years.
11The overall net invest-
ment ratio fell to only 31/C252% of the disposable
income of the domestic sectors, comparedwith 7
1/C252% in the second half of the 1980s.
This has been accompanied in recent years byan increasing outflow of domestic savings toother countries. In 2003 this amount reached50% of total savings.
A possible growth scenario
Three fundamental conclusions can be de-
rived from the above considerations. Firstly,there is a time window of around ten yearsbefore the outlined demographic trends
begin to weigh more heavily. Secondly, thereis a whole series of economic policy optionswhich can be used to ease or alleviate thearising burdens. Thirdly, the as yet unused po-tential for countermeasures is estimated to befairly high in Germany. This applies in particu-lar to the rate of employment and the labourforce participation rate as well as to workinghours.
The demographic burdens thus by no means
inevitably imply a scenario of doom andgloom. However, it remains to be seen towhat extent and when the economic policyoptions will be implemented. The precisecombination of instruments will also have abearing on the overall success. It would makelittle sense to rely on only one or a few eco-nomic policy adjustment parameters. Thescale of the demographic shifts alone is likelyto be too great to allow this. A more realisticand encouraging approach is therefore onewhich, focusing on the overall picture as wellas the interdependencies, seeks to address di-verse problems simultaneously. Under theseconditions the wealth losses threatened bydemographic change, which is without anhistorical precedent, will remain manageable.
Since the mid-1990s, the effective retirement
age has risen by around one year. This is prob-ably mainly associated with the introduction

tacles to, a stronger reliance on funding in the statutory

11However, the trend decline in the net investment ratio
is possibly overstated by the long phase of stagnation, –
especially compared with 1991 and 1992, which were
marked by the unification boom.

26Deutsche BundesbankDemographics, wealth and growth: some fundamental relationships
Demographic influences are among the long-
term determinants of (material) wealth or thegeneral standard of living and the macro-economic growth trend. Depending on thelength of the observation period and the type ofdemographic change, various effects may occurwhich have an impact on the level or the growthof income.
As a rule, wealth is measured as real GDP per
head of the population. This is only a very roughmeasure of the standard of living as it disregardsdepreciations of real and human capital, (net)transfer payments to the rest of the world andpossible changes in the terms of trade as well asdistribution and risk aspects which take accountof the breadth of participation in welfare andthe sustainability of an achieved income pos-ition. If, however, the primary objective is toidentify possible economic policy approaches, itis quite useful to reduce the analytical frame-work to key variables and relationships.
The development of real GDP can be described
using a simple growth decomposition. Thisbuilds on the definition of labour productivityand total hours worked, which in turn is derivedfrom the number of employed persons and thenumber of hours worked per employed person.The (real) per capita income (y) is thus deter-
mined by the average productivity of employedpersons (AP) and the effective labour force par-ticipation rate (EPR) of the total population:
y=A P *EPR
The total population also includes various
groups of persons who are not part of thepotential labour force:
– people who, for reasons of age, are not able
to work because they are either too young ortoo old, measured here by the overall de-pendency ratio (ODR);
– persons who are of working age but are
nevertheless neither employed nor registeredas unemployed. This group mainly consists ofthe inactive labour forces, but also of peoplewho, for health or family reasons, for ex-ample, are not available for work or are avail-able only to a limited extent as well as peoplein training, measured here by the inactivityrate (IR);
– unemployed persons, measured here by the
unemployment rate (UR).

27Thus, the overall effective participation rate,
that is the proportion of the population em-ployed, is calculated as follows:
EPR¼

ð1þODRÞ
If, for the sake of simplicity, one also assumes a
linear homogeneous Cobb-Douglas productionfunction for the economy as a whole under com-petitive conditions with Harrod-neutral tech-nical progress, the level of labour productivityper employed person is determined both by theprogress component (A) and capital intensity (k)weighted by the profit ratio ( a), ie by the two
determinants of hourly productivity, as well asinter alia by the average working hours (h).

Thus, the amount of per capita income (y) is cal-
culated using the following basic equation:

1/C0UR/C21This simplified theoretical framework can be used
to estimate the impact of variables influencinggrowth. Five major complexes can be differenti-ated, behind which are various determinants:
– the productivity component– the working time component– the demographic component– the inactivity component– the unemployment component.However, the framework should not be inter-
preted mechanistically. The sometimes complexdependencies between the respective compon-ents and feedback mechanisms that compoundthe direct partial effects also need to be takeninto account. For example, an increase in thefemale participation rate would probably re-duce the average annual number of hoursworked and could also have a dampening effecton the measured labour productivity in theeconomy as a whole. Furthermore, it should beborne in mind that although certain measures– such as changes in working hours – may affectthe wealth and income level in the longer term,they will not have a lasting effect on the respect-ive growth rate.

28of benefit deductions for claiming early retire-
ment. Since a significant number of new pen-sioners are still not fully affected by the de-ductions owing to transitional arrangements,the increase in the average retirement age islikely to continue. Furthermore, the earliestpossible age at which it is possible to claim apension as a result of unemployment or aspart of age-induced part-time work is to beraised from 60 to 63 years between 2006 and2008. This will also affect those insured per-sons who would have taken early retirementdespite the deductions. Finally, after 2012,the special option of early retirement at60 years of age for women will no longerapply. Furthermore, in 2008 the Federal Gov-ernment is obliged to present its first reportoutlining the framework requirements foremploying older employees. On this basis, adecision should then be made as to whetherto raise the statutory retirement age, which iscurrently set at 65 years.
If by 2015 the average retirement age could
be raised by two years, the potential labourforce would be enlarged by around 2 millionor 4
1/C252%. This would yield considerable relief,
particularly for the factor labour. The contri-bution rates to the social security funds couldbe lower, not only as a result of the post-poned pension payments but also owing tothe potentially broader contribution base forthe other social security schemes. The relatedrequirement of actual employment for olderemployees will be easier to meet if the rise inthe tax and social security burden can be suc-cessfully curbed. This could trigger mutuallyreinforcing impulses towards greater employ-ment and a declining tax and social security
burden.
Regarding the average working time, this
scenario assumes that it will be lowered lessand less on balance and that at the end ofthe forecast period it will be neutral vis-/C224-vis(potential) per capita income. This may none-theless imply an increase in the working weekor a corresponding cut in holidays if, in thecase of an increasing labour force participa-tion rate, the trend towards part-time em-ployment continues.
If, in addition, the employment intensity of
the growth process can be raised by removingobstacles which stand in the way of the de-velopment of a low-income sector, a signifi-cant decline in structural unemployment maybe expected. A fall in the non-cyclical un-employment rate of around 3 percentagepoints over the next ten years appears to berealistic under these conditions.
Looking at productivity per hour, it should be
remembered that it is partly endogenous andthat technological changes are very difficult toanticipate. The extension of working time, thereintegration of unemployed persons into theemployment process and the sectoral struc-tural change are likely to have a dampeningimpact, whereas experience suggests that afaster pace of economic growth is associatedwith a higher productivity rate. The underlyingmodel calculations used here are thereforebased on a trend rate of labour productivity(on an hourly basis) of 1
1/C252% per year; this
roughly corresponds to the current basic rate.

29Adding together the aforementioned correct-
ive measures, based on the given forecastsconcerning the demographic trend, indicatesa potential path for macroeconomic growthover the next ten years which is around
1/C252per-
centage point above the average level overthe past ten years. For real per capita incomethis implies a strengthening of the growthrate to 2
1/C252% by the end of the forecast
period. Compared with the meagre rates ofthe 1990s and the first half of this decade,
the improvement would therefore be quitelarge. At the same time, this would create amore favourable basis for tackling the emer-ging demographic burdens that will by thenstart to have an impact. It remains the centraltask of economic policy makers to pave theway to enable a growth scenario, such as theone presented here, to take shape.

31The insurance
sector as a financial
intermediaryIn Germany, the insurance sector,
which is the second-largest group offinancial intermediaries after banks,has traditionally played a key role inhouseholds’ financial investment. Forvarious reasons, it has shifted moreclosely into the public eye in the pastfew years. One reason is that, since2002, changes to the relevant regula-tions have considerably increased theprominence of occupational and pri-vately funded old-age pension schemes.Another is that the investment policiesof life insurance corporations, in par-ticular, have been the subject of in-tense debate. In the wake of the stockmarket boom, life insurance corpor-ations increasingly added shares andforeign assets to their portfolios,which had traditionally featured do-mestic fixed-rate securities. The equitymarket slump meant that this invest-ment behaviour – which has since beenreversed in some cases – led to a visibledecline in valuation reserves. Owing tothe relief in depreciation requirementsgranted in this connection, some in-struments even began to accumulate“hidden losses”. As the insurance in-dustry undertook consolidation meas-ures and stock prices have nowrecovered, however, insurance corpor-ations’ situation has taken a turn forthe better.

32Macroeconomic functions performed by
financial intermediaries
In Germany, financial intermediaries play a
central role in the flow of funds in the econ-omy as a whole. Owing to transaction costsand information asymmetry, households areusually not directly active on the capital mar-kets. Rather, they employ the services offinancial intermediaries who are capable ofmore efficiently and cost-effectively reconcil-ing the supply and demand of capital giventhe aforementioned market imperfection. Byfunctioning as pools of capital, these financialintermediaries generally improve the alloca-tion of capital – and the allocation of risk aswell – thereby ultimately enhancing the effi-ciency of the economy.
The total amount of financial assets invested
with intermediaries by households, non-financial corporations and general govern-ment, at 33
1/C252trillion according to the finan-
cial accounts, exceeded by far the amount ofshares or bonds purchased directly on thecapital market by the non-financial sectors.This dominance of “intermediary” institutionsis mirrored by the financing side of non-financial areas, too. Within the institutionalinvestor sector, too, banks, or more precisely,monetary financial institutions (MFIs), wereby far the largest financial intermediaries interms of their balance sheet total, whichamounted to 35.4 trillion at the end of 2003.
The private insurance sector
1accounted for
just under one-fifth ( 31.3 trillion) of the bal-
ance sheet total of financial intermediaries inGermany. By contrast, the total liabilities of“other financial institutions”, which include,first and foremost, mutual funds and which
reported a volume of just over 3800 billion at
the end of 2003, account for around one-tenth of the German financial sector.
Role of insurance corporations
in the saving process
A core task of the private insurance sector is
to protect against individual risks resultingfrom changing fortunes in human life. Suchprotection hinges on the calculability of risks.These risks include various types of damagerisk as well as health, death and longevityrisks. In this function, private insuranceschemes complement social security systems.However, these two sectors are funded byfundamentally different means. Whereas thecontribution payments to private insuranceschemes are calculated according to theequivalence principle, redistribution aspectsare still a major factor in public insurance sys-tems.
So-called “insurance technical reserves”,
which are made up of contributions by andinterest credited to the insured, are formed tocover the assumed risks. At the end of 2003they amounted to just over 31 trillion, or
around 80% of the entire balance sheettotal. Since many insurance corporations arerun as public limited companies, the amountof shares in circulation valued at market

tor is made up of “insurance corporations and (autono-

the liabilities side, was around 3140 billion
and hence only very slightly lower than thatof all banks.
Households are the main investor in the insur-
ance sector. In 2003 they accounted foraround 90% of all claims or, to be precise, in-surance technical reserves. The claims of thecorporate sector and of non-residentsamounted to only 4% and 6% respectively.Since 1991, households’ claims on insurancecorporations and pension funds have risenmuch faster than their financial assets, iefrom nearly 3400 billion to just over 3900 bil-
lion last year. However, this growth sloweddown somewhat after 2000. This was dueless to an ebbing of interest in insuranceproducts and more to a decline in capital bo-nuses caused by falling capital market rates
and lower share prices.
If one analyses the acquisition of financial
assets over the long term, insurance saving isplaying a distinctly increasing role in house-holds’ investment decisions. After accountingalmost invariably for around 15% of overallfinancial investment over a 30-year periodsince 1950, insurance saving rose to nearly30% in the 1980s and, after reunification,went up to as high as one-third of totalhousehold investment. After the years of re-construction, an increased trend towardshedging risks and the establishment of thepractice of making private provisions for oldage have contributed to this development.

34along with attractive real rates of return, have
played a major role. Lately, too, the debateabout the sustainability of the pay-as-you-gostatutory pension insurance scheme and theincreasingly apparent need for a supplemen-tary private old-age provision scheme havegiven a boost to the demand for relevant in-surance products.
It is instructive to take a look at the various in-
surance sectors in which households are hold-ing financial assets. At the end of 2002– more recent information is not yet avail-able – investment in life insurance corpor-ations, which accounted for just over 3550
billion, or just under two-thirds of the market,played the dominant role. This comes as nosurprise given the fact that it is precisely trad-itional life insurance schemes which haveserved as longer-term capital investment ve-
hicles and also often as old-age provision in-struments. Private health insurance schemes,too, have now accumulated a considerablecapital stock of nearly 390 billion. These re-
serves serve to cushion the impact of sharplyrising healthcare costs during old age andthus to keeping contributions relativelystable. Damage and accident insuranceschemes hold 355 billion worth of assets, lag-
ging far behind the other insurance sectors interms of the amount of assets held by each ofthese sectors. In these schemes, asset forma-tion is much less important than ongoingclaims adjustment.
In addition to holding claims against insur-
ance corporations in the stricter sense, house-holds also hold claims on various pensionHouseholds’ financial investment in a long-term perspective*

35funds which, in their function as institutional
investors and as old-age provision schemes,are comparable to life insurance corporations.At the end of 2002, assets invested in themamounted to nearly 3200 billion, or just over
one-fifth of all claims against the insurancesector. If, for ease of international compari-son, the claims on company-based pensionschemes, which are especially formed bymanufacturing enterprises for making pen-sion payments, were included, the resultingamount would be twice as high.
Saving through insurance corporations
by different types of household
The results of various surveys show that
households regard insurance corporations asplaying a very important role in capital invest-ment. One survey shows that just under halfof all households hold some sort of life insur-ance policy and nearly one-fifth a private pen-sion insurance policy.
2This is consistent with
asset-related information contained in theFederal Statistical Office’s income and ex-penditure survey ( Einkommens- und Ver-
brauchsstichprobe, hereinafter EVS) of 2003,
which records not only claims against insur-ance corporations
3but also other key finan-
cial assets. The survey finds that over 20 mil-lion households – or just over half of allhouseholds – possess some sort of insuranceassets. Only bank deposits are more wide-spread. In terms of volume, too, insurancesaving ranks behind bank-based saving but isfar ahead of all other forms of saving, a find-ing which is confirmed by financial accountsfigures. At the beginning of 2003, each Ger-man household held, on average, nearly
312,000 worth of insurance assets, which ac-
counts for just over one-quarter of all finan-cial assets recorded in EVS. A comparison be-tween eastern and western Germany showsdistinct differences; west German figureswere double those of eastern Germany. How-ever, it must be noted that the role of the pri-vate insurance sector was negligible in theformer German Democratic Republic; for thatreason, financial investment in insurance cor-porations in the new Laender in the early1990s was virtually a non-factor.
In addition, EVS provides useful information
on the breakdown of assets invested in insur-ance corporations by the social status, in-come and age of the investors. Of the groupsof society recorded, the self-employed ac-counted for the largest amounts invested byfar. At just under 340,000, their value was
around three and a half times the average ofall households. Civil servants and salariedstaff averaged 315,000 per household. The
main reason for this wide gulf is that the self-employed often use private insurance to pro-vide for old age, whereas the other groupsare mainly included in the public social secur-ity systems. In addition, income is clearly animportant factor: the value of insuranceassets rises constantly in line with the incomecategories reported in EVS. Whereas house-holds with a net monthly income of under32,000 averaged only slightly more than
35,000 in assets, the comparable value for

36the highest income bracket was ten times
higher. Finally, the age-related data support,to a certain degree, the life-cycle hypothesisthat households tend to try to smooth theirconsumption by adjusting their saving andborrowing patterns accordingly over time andby not orienting themselves as much to theircurrent income situation.
4In the case of in-
surance, the saving process reached its max-imum in the 45-65 age range; all other agegroups had significantly lower holdings ofsuch assets. However, the insurance assetsthat were the subject of the EVS survey hadnot been depleted by old age, either. This islikely to be associated primarily with privatepension funds and burial insurance policies.EU-wide comparison of households’
investment in insurance products
It is also true for other west European EU
member states that households have relative-ly sizeable claims against the private insur-ance sector. The extent of such financialassets is closely linked with the specific designof social insurance and company pension sys-tems. Like France, Germany was in the mid-dle of the pack of large EU member states in2002, with insurance assets amounting tojust over 50% of nominal gross domesticproduct (GDP). Claims were much greater inthe United Kingdom and the Netherlands, atjust over 130% and 140% of GDP respective-ly. Italy and Spain, with claims amounting toHouseholds’ average insurance assets*

37one-third and one-quarter of GDP respective-
ly, lagged far behind. The major importanceof life insurance in the United Kingdom and,more decisively, the widespread use of indi-vidual and company pension schemes havecaused insurance saving to reach such pro-portions in the United Kingdom and theNetherlands. As a result, claims on pensionfunds have reached similarly high levels.
However, developments have varied greatly
from one country to another over the pastfew years. In France, Germany, Italy andSpain, households’ financial investment in in-surance corporations has continued to go up;in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom,by contrast, such investment has droppedsharply. In the Netherlands, the drop relativeto GDP was just under 30 percentage pointsbetween 1999 and the end of 2002; in theUnited Kingdom, such investment fell byeven twice this figure. The drop in shareprices since 2000 has had a lasting effect onthe assets of insured persons. One reason isthe large share of unit-linked life insurancepolicies, whose accumulated capital is gener-ally not guaranteed and which are stronglyoriented to shares; another reason is thatpension funds’ investment in shares, whosevalue plummeted in 2001 and 2002, contrib-uted to these capital losses.
It is true that such sharp shifts in assets have
had hardly any major impact in Germany be-cause equity investment accounts for a small-er share of capital investment there than, forinstance, in the UK insurance sector owing,among other things, to relevant investmentregulations. However, since German insur-ance corporations’ share prices have also

status and investment behaviour
Insurance corporations’ investment behaviour
changed considerably during the 1990s. Theytended to invest more heavily in the equitymarket and in mutual funds, at the expenseof fixed-interest securities and bank deposits(for details see the tables on pages 41 and42). The greatest growth was shown by mu-tual funds shares, whose share in total capitalinvestment doubled. Most of these were spe-Households’ claims on the insurance

corporation to the individual needs of its in-vestors. These indirect investments have anumber of advantages for insurance corpor-ations. One is that they often provide a cost-effective alternative to establishing an inde-pendent portfolio management and researchsection. Equity portfolio, investment in for-eign currency and investment on foreign cap-ital markets are the most prominent ex-amples. Another reason is that, for a longtime, indirect investment in securities throughmutual funds afforded greater accountingleeway and tax advantages since, prior to theintroduction of the International Financial Re-porting Standards (IFRS), mutual funds shareswere eligible to be counted as an independ-ent investment instrument valued at historicalcosts in insurance corporations’ balancesheets. This meant, for instance, that valu-ation gains could be realised in a tax-neutralmanner, and it was easier to cushion the bal-ance sheet impact of valuation losses sincethe valuation basis was geared to the per-formance of total assets in the fund and notto the movements of individual instrumentswithin the fund. Since the introduction of theIFRS, however, it has been mandatory forshares in a fund over which economic controlis being exerted to be recorded at fair marketvalue and broken down by individual invest-ment category in the investor’s balance sheet.The composition of investments in specialisedfunds will therefore also be reflected in insur-ance corporations’ balance sheets in thefuture.
Domestic and foreign shares and foreign
bond market investment form the focal pointof insurance corporations’ specialised assets
managed by investment companies. Sharesmade up 30% of all capital investments heldvia specialised funds at the end of 2003, andforeign equities accounted for nearly two-thirds of this while just under two-thirds of in-direct bond market investment involved debtsecurities issued by non-residents.
Insurance corporations’ direct portfolio in-
vestment in shares, however, continues toconstitute a relatively small percentage ofcapital investment. At the end of 2003, verysimilarly to ten years earlier, it made uparound 2% of all capital investment valued atmarket prices. By contrast, the significance ofparticipating interests and shares in affiliatedenterprises has risen significantly. At the endof 2003, they accounted for just under 16%of German insurers’ total capital investment,compared with 8% a decade earlier.
Over the past ten years, investment in fixed-
interest securities, unquoted registered paperand borrowers’ notes and other deposits,which accounted for the lion’s share of port-folios, has become increasingly less import-ant. At the end of 2003 they accounted for42% of insurers’ total capital investment, asopposed to 52% ten years earlier. This dropwas even more pronounced at some pointsduring this period. Against the background ofthe euphoric mood on the stock markets in1999 and 2000, the share of these conven-tional capital investment instruments in totalinvestment even fell to 40%. It was only fol-lowing the sharp collapse in stock prices thatinvestment in bonds and bank deposits wentback up relatively strongly.

39The importance of surplus revenue for at-
tracting new customers and thus for individ-ual companies’ efforts to stake a position inthe market, is one of the forces driving in-surers, particularly life insurance corporations,to enter into higher-yielding, higher-riskforms of investment. The current overall re-turn on investment, which exceeds the statu-tory minimum rate of return and is boostedby profit-sharing, is generally closely ob-served. In the boom years, insurers competedwith yields on investment products such asmutual fund shares and adjusted the rates ofreturn upwards. In the leaner years, however,profit distribution was not greatly reduced, inorder to remain competitive. New investmentin fixed-interest securities and bank depositswould not have been enough to generate netrates of return on capital investment rangingon a sectoral average from 7.5% in 2000 to5% in 2003
5given long-term capital market
rates of 5.3% and 4.1% respectively; rather,these returns were the result of far-sighted in-vestment policies taken over the two preced-ing decades. The net rates of return werethus well in excess of the statutory minimumrates of return on life insurance contracts atthe time, ie 4% before 2000 and 3.25%from the year 2000.
6Despite this, in the fol-
lowing years life insurance corporations, inparticular, were forced to grapple with mas-sive depreciations because of the direct andindirect possession of shares and participatinginterests in conjunction with the stock marketslump, which had a severe impact on profitand loss accounts.
In order to cushion the impact of these spe-
cial events, in the interests of insured personsand the financial system as a whole alike, in-
surance corporations were granted relief indepreciation requirements in 2002 throughan amendment to section 341b of the Ger-man Commercial Code. It is now legal not todepreciate equity portfolio losses if the valu-ation loss is likely to be temporary. Such tem-porary losses have been specified by the Insti-tute of German Auditors ( Institut derNew investment regulation
The beginning of 2002 saw the entry into
force of the new investment regulation,which defines investment opportunitiesand investment limits for insurance cor-porations, thereby superseding section 54aof the Insurance Supervision Act ( Ver-
sicherungsaufsichtsgesetz ). The maximum
amount eligible for investment in shareswas increased from 30% to 35% of thecover fund assets. In addition, for the firsttime, asset-backed securities and credit de-rivatives (solely credit-linked notes, whichare a combination of a bond and a creditprotection transaction) were included inthe investment catalogue up to a maximumvolume of 7.5%, and investment opportun-ities outside the European Economic Areawere extended.

43Credit default
swaps – functions,
importance and
information contentThe market for credit default swaps
(CDS) has experienced explosive growthin the past few years. CDS allow creditrisks to be separated from the under-lying credit relationship and to betraded separately.
It is essential for central banks to ascer-
tain the extent to which developmentsin the markets for credit derivativesaffect financial stability. A broaderdistribution of credit risks improves thefinancial system’s overall ability toabsorb shocks. On the other hand,developments in the CDS markets mayalso pose risks, for example, if newcontagion channels increase the threatof systemic crises.
Although CDS markets are still in a nas-
cent stage, several studies indicatethat, owing to faster processing ofnew market information, CDS marketshave price leadership over bond mar-kets and act as a clear indicator of up-coming credit downgrades by ratingagencies. On the whole, the resultsshow that CDS prices contain informa-tion which is useful for the early detec-tion of potential critical developmentsin the financial system.

44underlying credit relationship. The ability to
trade these default risks separately extendsthe range of options available for the system-atic management of risk and income. This isof particular significance to banks. Further-more, CDS even allow for greater risk distri-bution in those sectors which cannot functionas a direct creditor in credit operations.
In quantitative terms, credit default swaps are
the most important and widely used instru-ments in the credit derivatives market. A CDSallows a risk shedder (protection buyer) toprotect himself for a specified period of timeagainst certain risks arising from a credit rela-tionship by paying the risk taker (protectionseller) a premium. These predefined risks(called credit events ) are based on the stand-
ards of the International Swaps and Deriva-tives Association (ISDA). Credit events gener-ally include late payment or default, filing forinsolvency protection or the restructuring ofliabilities to the detriment of the creditors.The risk taker undertakes to compensate therisk shedder if a credit event occurs. If theCDS is based on a credit relationship withonly one borrower (single-name CDS), therisk shedder transfers the reference asset(eg bonds or loans) to the risk taker. If this isdone by the physical delivery of securities(physical settlement is the market standard),the risk shedder usually has the choice be-tween securities of the same kind (cheapestto deliver option). Cash settlement is anotheroption. This involves an agreement to pay thedifference between the nominal value of thereference asset and its market value followinga credit event. This is particularly favouredwhen a CDS backs a loan portfolio fromwhich individual loans are more difficult to
separate. Credit default swaps are tradedover the counter (OTC market), allowing foran agreement which better suits the morespecific, non-standardised needs of bothcounterparties. The drawback is less liquidity.
The market for credit derivatives is a global
market in which particularly banks, credit in-surers, reinsurers, hedge funds, mutual fundsand major non-financial enterprises operate.The liabilities of non-financial enterprisescomprise the largest share of the referenceobligations. Worldwide, the market for creditderivatives has grown to approximatelyUS$5.5 trillion. Hence, although this marketis still relatively small compared to the marketfor interest-rate-related derivatives, its signifi-cance vis-/C224-vis other derivatives markets is in-

45creasing steadily owing to its extremely dy-
namic evolution. The volume of outstandingcredit derivatives contracts has already sur-passed that of the markets for equity deriva-tives and commodity derivatives.
1
A survey conducted by the Bundesbank in thesecond half of 2003 of the ten German banksmost active in the market for credit deriva-tives indicates that these institutions acted asrisk shedders in the CDS market for approxi-mately 3270 billion (of which 3220 billion in
single-name CDS) and as risk taker for ap-proximately 3235 billion (of which 3210 bil-
lion in single-name CDS).
2
According to the British Bankers’ Association,single-name CDS account for approximately51% of the global market for credit deriva-tives. Much like the overall market for creditderivatives, the CDS market is dominated byinternationally operating financial institutionswhich act as market makers in over-the-counter trading and as end users, conductingtransactions for their own trading book. Oneof the reasons for the high market concentra-tion lies in the fact that the use of CDS re-quires a disciplined analytical management ofrisks as well as a sophisticated technical infra-structure. High fixed costs often make it un-affordable for small and medium-sized play-ers to build up such capacity.
Even so, there has been a marked increase in
the activity of hedge funds and pension fundsin the CDS market, both as protection buyersand protection sellers. According to severalmarket observers, the increase in the tradingactivities of hedge funds, in particular, has attimes led to sharp movements in CDS
spreads.

bond-based funds focus on CDS indices andcollateralised debt obligations (CDO).

and Dow Jones iBoxx, the two largest pro-viders of CDS indices, to form Dow JonesiTraxx in mid-2004, created a group of in-dices, which in future are to also serve asunderlying assets for the trade of options andfutures. The iTraxx group of indices comprisesregional and sector subindices, which arederived from the market data on liquid CDScurrently provided by 19 traders.
5Creating the index has facilitated entry intothe CDS market – until now essentially aninterbank market – for investors who want tobuild up an exposure to the general markettrend. The tradable CDS indices are charac-terised by high market liquidity and relativelylow bid/ask spreads. The iTraxx Europe index,for example, carries a spread of 1 basis point.In future, the importance of CDS indices islikely to increase considerably, also vis-/C224-vissingle-name CDS.

After having peaked in October 2002, theCDS spreads of European enterprises havedeclined considerably. The narrower CDSspreads also reflect the fact that numerousenterprises were able to improve their creditrating by reducing their level of debt.

Reasons for the advance of CDS
The evolution of the CDS markets is being
buoyed by various factors. The growing num-ber of bankruptcies and particularly the risingfrequency of insolvencies of large enterprisesin the period from 2001 to 2003 heightenedmarket participants’ sensitivity to credit risksat an early stage in the markets’ develop-ment. Moreover, low transaction costs, which%

47fell further as the bid/ask spreads narrowed,
as well as the standardisation by the ISDA ofcontract terms and conditions, enhanced theattractiveness of the CDS market. It is precise-ly in comparison to conventional methods ofcredit risk transfer that CDS prove to be acost-effective alternative. For example, in thecase of CDS, only the credit risk is transferred;the underlying relationship between the bor-rower and lender remains intact.
Moreover, CDS can also be combined to cre-
ate new financial instruments, to better sat-isfy the needs of the risk shedder and risktaker. For instance, CDS contracts can formthe basis for complex structured credit prod-ucts such as collateralised debt obligations.Using such structured products, credit riskcan also be reduced by credit enhancements,which, for example, cover any non-coveredresidual risk that a risk taker may have.
Changes to credit risk management in the
banking sector are an additional factor con-tributing to greater use of CDS. As part oftheir credit risk management, banks are view-ing CDS more and more often as tradableproducts, which can be transferred to thirdparties before the maturity date. In this re-spect, the new supervisory rules provided forby Basel II are also increasing the incentivesfor banks to use CDS in the long term.
8For
example, Basel II raises the incentive to trans-fer credit risks to unregulated non-banks witha good credit rating as the core capital back-ing of the counterparty risk focuses only ondefault risk in general and does not differenti-ate between banks and non-banks. The regu-latory capital freed up through the transfer ofrisks can be used to back other risks. In add-
ition, banks are now gearing their risk man-agement more towards their overall loanportfolio instead of towards individual risks.
Furthermore, CDS represent an important in-
strument for managing the risk-return profileof a portfolio by separating default and inter-est rate risk. Hence, CDS also offer new possi-bilities of turning a given market opinion intoan investment strategy. Instead of purchasinga specific bond, a market participant whoconsiders certain credit risks to be overvaluedcan earn an attractive CDS premium as a pro-tection seller in the CDS market. On the otherhand, market participants who consider risksEnd of week

48to be undervalued can purchase protection
by paying a premium. Owing to the limitedpossibilities for short sales in the bond mar-ket, hedge funds are increasingly enteringinto positions in the CDS market to imple-ment their investment strategies.
From the protection seller’s point of view, the
income received from payment of the CDSpremiums – apart from managing the risks ofa loan portfolio – is one of the main reasonsfor using CDS. CDS premiums are generatedwithout having to tie up any capital for thepurchase of a bond issue (at least as long asno credit event occurs). In an environment offalling interest rates, investors’ search for at-tractive investment opportunities has boosteddemand for credit risk and provided addition-al impetus to the CDS market.
CDS allow participants to take advantage of
arbitrage opportunities vis-/C224-vis the bondmarket since, in principle, a risky bond can beduplicated through a risk-free investment or aCDS contract taken out on a suitable refer-ence debtor. As a rule, however, CDS trade islimited to liquid credit positions, which meansthat any operations in the CDS market arepossible for only a limited number of debtsecurities.
Impact on financial stability
The rise of CDS can make a positive contribu-
tion towards greater financial stability. Nega-tive shocks to the financial system tend to beabsorbed better through a greater distribu-tion of risks to various market players. For ex-ample, there are indications that the markets
for credit derivatives helped to soften at leastpart of the burden on the financial systemstemming from the large number of corpor-ate insolvencies in 2001 and 2002. Even so,at that time market liquidity was concen-trated on only a relatively low number of debtsecurities.
Market studies have shown that the realloca-
tion of credit risks, which goes hand in handwith tradability, occurs primarily within thebanking system. A broader diversification ofcredit risks in banks’ portfolios enhances theability to handle shocks both in the financialmarkets and in the real economy. This could,for example, curb the risk of credit scarcity onthe supply side. However, from the perspec-tive of financial stability, the real question ishow the use of CDS impacts the financialsystem as a whole. This is closely linked to theultimate allocation of credit risks arisingthrough their use. At the moment, there isnot yet enough information available toassess the overall risk situation.
On the other hand, CDS can also contribute
to instability in the financial system. Owing tocompetitive pressure, for example, banksmight use their newly gained leeway to enterinto new risks. The transfer of risks to marketplayers outside of the banking system whichdo not have a suitable risk management sys-tem in place and are subject to less supervi-sion would lead to an increase in the accumu-lated risks in the financial system as a whole.
Moreover, further risks arise from the trade of
CDS which, in the event of major shocks,

49could possibly exacerbate the risk of systemic
crises. The CDS market remains characterisedby a large concentration of trading at a fewlarge banks. Apart from their own direct op-erations as risk shedder or risk taker, banksare also active in the CDS markets as inter-mediaries. Hence, the withdrawal of onelarge intermediary from the market could im-pair the smooth functioning of trading inCDS.
Given asymmetric information, an opportun-
istic streak (moral hazard) could stand in theway of efficient CDS trading. It is thereforeconceivable that banks, in their capacity aslenders, could use their information advan-tage regarding individual loans to pass onmainly bad risks. Furthermore, for the protec-tion buyer, there might be less incentive tocontinue monitoring the creditworthiness ofthe reference entity with the same intensity.This would result in market participants beingless willing to assume credit risks and in themarket charging an additional risk premiumfor this structural risk. Any such additionalrisk premium would then also distort the in-formation content of the CDS spreads. Thethreat of a tarnished reputation to the riskshedder could, however, mitigate the moralhazard problem. This problem should nothave any impact on highly liquid bonds inparticular.
Information content of CDS
A non-distorted reflection of debtor-specific
information in CDS spreads is of importanceto both market participants and to overall fi-nancial stability. With a view to financial sta-
bility it is important to have as wide as pos-sible a range of indicators which deliver reli-able early warning signals of any loomingrisks. CDS markets may exhibit different pri-cing behaviour from that of conventionalfinancial markets. CDS can therefore be apotential source of important additional in-formation.
The reliability of CDS spreads as an indicator
for conducting a stability analysis depends toa large degree on how closely they are linkedto default probabilities and to what extentthey are appropriate to identify changes indebtors’ creditworthiness. An examination ofthe potential leading indicator property ofmarket prices prior to rating changes cancontribute to an assessment of thosechanges. In this context, it is also relevant toascertain whether the CDS markets act as aleading price indicator for the bond marketsin terms of time and hence, as a source ofinformation.
Based on the arbitrage-related integration of
both markets, CDS prices and bond risk pre-mia should actually be closely linked. How-ever, a number of factors weaken the pricelink between CDS and bond markets. Theseinclude liquidity restrictions, tax treatments,limited short-selling opportunities, callablebonds and an additional counterparty defaultrisk in the case of CDS.
According to a study conducted by Zhu, the
available liquidity in the CDS and bond mar-kets plays a major role in explaining existing

50price differences in both markets.9In the cor-
porate bond market, many participants holdtheir securities until maturity. Liquidity in thesecondary markets is too low to permit exten-sive dealing in major credit risks at relativelylow transaction costs.
A recent study of the CDS market by Fitch
comes to the conclusion that in normal mar-ket situations, there are sufficient liquidityand tightening bid/ask spreads.
10This same
study points out, though, that in certain mar-ket phases, CDS prices were not always ableto reconcile supply and demand. This was thecase, for example, during the WorldCom cri-sis in the summer of 2002, when the demandfor protection in the bond markets rose andonly a few market participants were willing toact as protection sellers. However, non-market-clearing CDS prices naturally losemuch of their information content.
Price discovery in the CDS market and
bond market
Compared to the bond market, the CDS mar-
ket is still likely to be the easiest way to tradecredit risk without any major restrictions.Real-time processing of information providedby well-informed market participants is es-sential for an accurate assessment of creditrisk. In this respect, price discovery representsa key function of secondary markets. The re-sults of a study by Zhu, which are based onmarket data from 1999 to 2002, suggestprice leadership of the CDS market vis-/C224-visthe bond markets for the United States butnot for other regions.Bundesbank studies come to the conclusion
that in Europe, too, the CDS market has alead over the bond market with respect tothe reaction to new data and that, in theshort term, marked – albeit temporary – pricedifferences occur. One additional importantreason for this could be that the CDS marketprovides a specialised platform for the tradeof debtor-specific credit risks, whereas in thebond market, the features of the individualbonds also determine pricing.
The correlation between market prices
and ratings
The efficiency of CDS and bond spreads in
the price discovery process can also be exam-ined in connection with the movements incredit ratings. Risk models and early warningsystems, which take account of the prices invarious markets as well as macroeconomicvariables, are already widely used by riskmanagers to assess credit risks. Rating agen-cies, too, are increasingly using market-price-based risk models, such as the KMV model,
11
which augments Robert Merton’s equityvalue model and which Moody’s uses toevaluate default probabilities.
In contrast to market prices, which react very
quickly to new information, ratings tend to

51Empirical evidence of price discovery in the European CDS and bond markets
Price discovery is the efficient, real-time processing of
information factored into market prices. As credit risksare traded in the bond market and in the CDS market,price discovery can take place in both markets. In thiscontext, price leadership in one market means thatprice discovery in that market occurs based exclusivelyon new market-relevant information and not on pricechanges in the other market. In terms of prices, theequilibrium between CDS and bond spreads can be af-fected temporarily if, in the market with price leader-ship, prices change owing to new market-relevantinformation. The other market adapts to these pricechanges until a new equilibrium is found between thetwo markets.
A Bundesbank empirical study focuses on the correl-
ation between the markets for CDS and bonds issuedby European enterprises. The study was based on dailymarket prices (in euro) provided by Bloomberg onbonds and CDS contracts with a maturity of five yearsduring the observation period of October 2001 toAugust 2004. To calculate matching bond yields with aconstant residual maturity of five years, for each pointin time a weighted interpolation of the yields of sev-eral bonds of one issuer was conducted. For each trad-ing day, at least one bond issue with a residual matur-ity of less than five years and at least one bond issuewith a residual maturity of more than five years was re-quired. This sharply reduced the number of referenceenterprises included in the estimates. The bond spreadswere then calculated from the interpolated bondyields minus the five-year euro swap rate.
In the event of a unique long-term correlation (cointe-
gration relationship) between CDS and bond spreadsof the reference enterprises, the following vector errorcorrection model has been estimated.

This model assesses the long-term correlation between
CDS spreads and bond spreads (the equation in par-entheses) as well as the influence of past spread
changes on current spread changes. The coefficients l1
and l2measure the velocity at which the CDS and
bond spreads move back to equilibrium following a de-viation from the long-term relationship between thetwo markets. A significantly negative coefficient l

suggests that CDS spreads move later than bond
spreads in order to re-establish the equilibrium rela-tionship between the two markets. Conversely, a sig-nificantly positive coefficient l
2suggests that an
adjustment of the bond spreads takes place to re-establish the equilibrium relationship.
The Granger and Gonzalo measure GG = l
2/(l2–l1)
can be used to better illustrate the contribution ofboth markets to price discovery. It indicates to what ex-tent price leadership occurs in the CDS or the bondmarket. If GG > 0.5, the CDS market leads in terms ofprice discovery. A GG of < 0.5 indicates that price dis-covery occurs mainly in the bond market. An assess-ment based on this measure shows that in 59% of thecases studied, the CDS market leads in price discoverywhereas price leadership occurs in the bond market in29%. In 12% of the estimates there was no clear evi-dence of price leadership in either of the two markets.
The results are in line with those of Blanco et al,
1who
suggest that the CDS market dominates price discoveryin the market for corporate credit, although the bondmarket also plays a discernible role.

52be more stable in nature (less volatile). This is
because rating agencies do not adjust theirratings every time new information appearsregarding the financial situation of an issueror if there is a model-induced change in thedefault probabilities. A rating is usually onlychanged when the new outlook is supportedby a sustainable change in the informationbase and the change in the issuer’s credit-worthiness is due to profound structuralchanges rather than merely to the cyclicalsituation. This is intended to ensure a certaindegree of rating stability throughout the eco-nomic cycle and to prevent having to reviserating changes again shortly thereafter. Thissuggests that the changes in default probabil-ities are reflected more quickly in marketprices than in ratings.
On the other hand, rating agencies base their
credit ratings on a wide range of informationwhich is not necessarily available in the publicdomain and which supplements market pricedata. Hence, rating changes are indeed ofimportance to the markets.
CDS are of particular interest with respect to
their ability to predict rating changes sincethey – as mentioned – have the potential toprocess information on creditworthiness morequickly than bond prices can.
Initial empirical analyses
12suggest that CDS
markets anticipate rating downgrades. CDSspreads have the tendency to not only antici-pate rating downgrades, but they also reactmore quickly to a review for downgrade thanthe equity markets.
13CDS spreads widen in
line with rating downgrades.The following analysis of market price move-
ments before and after a rating change isbased on the CDS and bond spreads of Euro-pean enterprises and information on ratingchanges conducted by Moody’s, Standard &Poor’s (S&P) and FitchRatings between 2001and 2004. CDS and bond spreads were ad-justed for market effects to measure issuer-specific influences on market prices. To obtainthis information, the difference was calcu-lated between the changes in CDS spreadsand the changes in CDS indices, which com-prise single-name CDS of debtors with thesame rating. The Merrill Lynch indices ofEuropean corporate bonds with equal credit-worthiness and a residual maturity of fiveyears were used for individual bond issues.
The index-adjusted CDS and bond spreads re-
flect the changes in issuers’ creditworthinesseven weeks before a rating change occurs.When a review for downgrade is announced,the spreads widen even more than when anactual downgrade occurs. This may be due tothe fact that a negative outlook often pre-cedes a rating downgrade.
A rating upgrade is usually accompanied by a
narrowing of CDS and bond spreads. Com-pared to an actual upgrade, a review for up-grade by the same rating agency results in agreater narrowing of spreads.

53On the day before a rating downgrade or a
review for downgrade, the CDS spreads(bond spreads) have, on average, alreadywidened by 68% (56%) of the maximumwidening occurring during the overall obser-vation period of 60 trading days before and60 trading days after a rating event. In thecase of an upgrade or a review for upgrade,on the day before an announcement is madethe CDS spreads (bond spreads) narrow by anaverage of 62% (54%) of the maximum nar-rowing during the observation period. There-fore, the rating change is already anticipatedto a large degree by the market, althoughmarket prices also show a significant reactiondirectly following a rating change.
On balance, these results show that, first,
market price movements do have a leadingindicator property prior to a change to anissuer’s credit rating. The observed wideningof CDS spreads before a rating downgrade isparticularly well substantiated in statisticalterms. Furthermore, the fact that CDSspreads react more strongly than bondspreads before the announcement of a ratingchange confirms the price leadership propertyof the CDS market.
Determinants of CDS spreads
The leading indicator property of CDS spreads
prior to rating changes suggests that CDSspreads contain information which is signifi-cant for estimating the probabilities of the oc-currence of credit events. The more risk pre-mia depend on determinants which have astrong correlation to default probabilities, theBasis

54greater the information content for assessing
credit risks. Determinants of risk premia maycomprise both enterprise-specific and macro-economic variables and will be examined ingreater detail below.
Portfolio theory would expect to see a posi-
tive correlation between interest rates andrisk premia. If interest rates rise, investorstend to shift away from riskier investments tosafe instruments with attractive interest rates.The attendant lower demand for riskier in-vestments leads to rising risk premia on theseissues. Conversely, the marked fall in interestrates since the end of 2002 has buoyed de-mand for higher-interest-bearing instrumentsas many investors no longer find the low rateof interest on risk-free investments attractive(search for yield). This increased demand forrisky investments has contributed to a sharpdrop in the risk premia. The fact that enter-prise value also depends on expected futureincome, which is more heavily discountedwhen interest rates are rising, also suggests apositive correlation between interest ratesand risk premia. Furthermore, rising interestrates push up the cost of financing.
Bearing the aforementioned arguments in
mind, risk premia are also influenced by ex-pectations about future interest rate move-ments and cyclical developments, which arereflected in the yield curve.
The financial soundness of an enterprise,
which hinges to a large degree on the level ofindebtedness and profitability, is a significantenterprise-specific determinant of risk pre-mia. Both of these factors are approximatedin the estimating approach presented here
through equity price movements as there areno informative weekly data available on thelevel of indebtedness.
The probability of default owing to overin-
debtedness increases with the volatility of thefirm’s equity. This is factored into the estimat-ing approach by taking account of theimplied volatility of the share price which iscalculated using option prices.
Non-restricted tradability directly influences
the attractiveness of an investment. In thecase of low liquidity, which is expressed as arule in a widening of the bid/ask spread, themarket demands a liquidity premium.
The results of an empirical study carried out
by the Bundesbank on the sensitivity of CDSspreads in relation to the aforementioned de-terminants are based on panel estimates,using weekly data of 37 European enterprisesover a period from May 2002 to October2004. The results of ordinary least square esti-mates are robust and are confirmed by apanel cointegration approach using instru-ment variables.

The significantly positive correlation betweenthe changes in the year-on-year interest rateand the changes in the CDS premia is com-patible with the aforementioned portfolio

(exogenous variables) used in the estimating approach
depend on the CDS spreads (endogenous variable). This

55theory argumentation and reflects the phe-
nomenon of the search for yield during theobservation period. The improvement in thefinancing conditions which accompanies fall-ing interest rates has also strengthened enter-prises’ financial situation during the estima-tion period. The positive correlation betweenthe slope of the yield curve (difference be-tween the 10-year and 2-year yield) and theCDS spreads also suggests an interlinkage.
A rising share price leads to narrowing CDS
spreads. Conversely, as expected, rising vola-tility and a widening of the bid/ask spreadlead to an increase in the CDS premia.
Despite the statistically significant influence
of the examined variables on CDS spreads, onbalance the estimates can explain only a rela-tively small share (approximately 12%) of thevariability of the CDS spreads. One reason forthis may be the fact that certain enterprise-specific determinants such as the financingstructure cannot be adequately factored intothe panel approach selected here with highfrequency time series.
The phenomenon of a large proportion of un-
explainable determinants was also identifiedin other studies on the determinants of riskpremia. These studies show that approxi-mately three-quarters of the changes can beaccounted for by a systemic factor which isnot captured by the usual models.
15Further-
more, a principal component analysis of theresults presented here shows that the non-explanatory variance of the CDS spreadchanges are mainly driven by a commonfactor.This suggests that risk premia are determined
to a large extent by supply and demand fac-tors which affect the entire market. The Bun-desbank’s empirical analysis was unable toidentify which factors are at play; it can atbest limit them in qualitative terms, requiringan examination of both macroeconomic andmarket structure determinants.
The development of the market is embedded
in the macroeconomic and monetary frame-work. It can therefore be assumed that theCDS premia are determined to a large extentby cyclical developments. However, the sharprise in default rates during recessions cannotbe captured fully by the selected estimatingEstimated sensitivity of CDS spreads

56approach. Moreover, the financial environ-
ment during the estimation period was char-acterised by factors which had a considerableoverall influence on the credit markets. Theseinclude extraordinarily low interest rates, highliquidity in the financial markets and changesin enterprises’ financing structures. In add-ition, the changes in risk propensity and riskaversion are also likely to affect demand foracquiring and the willingness to sell protec-tion against credit risks.
From a more technical market perspective it
should be pointed out that the CDS markets,much like other credit derivatives markets,are still in a nascent stage. Experience hasshown that during such stages, structural fac-tors, such as the growing number of marketparticipants, do have an overall impact onprice discovery in the CDS market.Outlook
In future, the explosive development of the
CDS market will play an increasingly import-ant role as an indicator of credit risk develop-ments. CDS are already fulfilling an importantfunction with regard to price discovery in thecredit markets. This fact is also expressed intheir ability to clearly anticipate changes inrating agencies’ assessments before theyoccur. Apart from additional indicators suchas risk models for assessing default probabil-ities, CDS therefore make an important con-tribution to the early detection of financialrisks.
For this reason, ongoing monitoring of the
credit risk transfer market is indispensable forgaining new insights into the stability of thefinancial markets.
