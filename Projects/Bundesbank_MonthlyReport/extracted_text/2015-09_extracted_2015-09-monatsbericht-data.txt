Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The recent fairly steep upturn in macroeco -
nomic activity in Germany is likely to have con -
tinued in the summer months. The ongoing 
growth in employment and the increase in 
households’ scope for spending on the back of 
distinctly higher earnings and contracting en -
ergy prices provide for favourable consumption 
activity, which is continuing to drive domestic 
demand and stimulate growth in the services 
sector. However, German industrial output 
once again failed to get off the ground at the 
beginning of the third quarter despite the 
 vibrant growth in exports. This means that the 
pick-  up in industrial activity – the basis for 
which had been laid by the preceding rise in 
new orders – is still taking some time to materi -
alise.
Industry
Industrial output in July showed only a mar -
ginal month- on- month rise (+¼%) in seasonally 
adjusted terms, despite favourable holiday pat -
terns. This was in fact slightly lower than the 
average of the second quarter (-¼%). Capital 
goods output clearly expanded on the second 
quarter (+1½%), mainly driven by the steep in -
crease in the manufacture of motor vehicles 
and motor vehicle parts, with the timing of 
plant shutdowns also playing their part. By 
contrast, there was a marked decrease in the 
production of intermediate goods (-1¼%) and 
a steep decline in consumer goods output 
(-3%).
The underlying trend in industrial orders is still 
pointing upwards. Although there was a clear 
seasonally adjusted decline in orders in July 
compared with the previous month, which had 
benefited from large- scale orders in particular, they were only slightly down on the second 
quarter (-¼%), when a steep 3% rise had been 
recorded. In July, manufacturers of capital 
goods even recorded a slight increase on the 
second quarter (+¼%), although the previously 
very high number of orders for motor vehicles 
and motor vehicle parts from countries outside 
the euro area contracted sharply. Orders from 
non- euro- area countries were clearly down on 
the second quarter (-5½%) overall. New orders 
of consumer goods recorded an exceptionally 
steep decline (-7%), with the decrease concen -
trated on orders from the euro area. However, 
this was offset by the fact that the figure for 
the total inflow of orders from the euro- area 
partner countries was again very positive 
(+3¼%). Domestic orders also saw a significant 
2½% rise on the second quarter, but there are 
still no signs of a clear upward trend here.
Industrial sales in July were up substantially by 
2½% on the month after seasonal adjustment 
and therefore clearly exceeded the second-  
quarter average (+1¼%). Foreign trade played 
a major role here (+2%), whilst domestic sales 
remained lacklustre (+¼%). Business with 
buyers from the euro area developed particu -
larly favourably (+3%), but sales in non- euro-  
area countries also increased markedly (+1½%). 
This was accompanied by further steep growth 
in nominal goods exports which expanded by a 
seasonally adjusted 2½% on the month in July, 
thereby exceeding the average of the second 
quarter by 2¼% (also by +2¼% in price-  
adjusted terms). Nominal imports of goods also 
rose steeply in July; after seasonal adjustment, 
there was a 2¼% increase on the month and a 
2% rise on the second quarter, which was even 
more pronounced in price- adjusted terms 
(+2¾%).Fairly steep 
 economic growth probably continued in Q3, although pick- up in industrial ac-tivity still taking some time to materialise

Construction
Construction output in July experienced a steep 
3¼% month- on- month rise after seasonal ad -
justment and was thus up ¾% on the second 
quarter. This was due mainly to a considerable 
increase in the finishing trades (+2¾%), which 
more than compensated for the decline in 
June. When interpreting these fluctuations it 
should be noted that the statistical data on the 
finishing trades, which are calculated on the 
basis of administrative data, are subject to con -
siderable uncertainty and often undergo major 
revision. By contrast, seasonally adjusted out -
put in the main construction sector failed to 
match the average level of the second quarter 
(-¾%). Data on the volume of new orders in 
the main construction sector are so far only 
available up to the second quarter, when a 
strong decrease had been recorded on the ele -
vated prior-quarter level which had been 
buoyed by a number of large- scale orders (-5% 
in seasonally adjusted terms).
Labour market
There was a further perceptible rise in employ -
ment in July. The seasonally adjusted number 
of persons in work in Germany increased by 
26,000 on the month, which is the highest 
monthly growth rate so far this year. The year- 
on- year increase was 160,000 persons, or 
0.4%. The higher monthly employment growth 
is probably due in part to the fact that, unlike 
in the first few months of the year, exclusively 
low- paid part- time employment has not shown 
such a marked decline of late. According to ini -
tial figures provided by the Federal Employment 
Agency, the number of employees subject to 
social security contributions showed a clear rise 
in June. There was a year- on- year increase of 
547,000 persons, or 1.8%. The leading indica -
tors for the labour market provided by the Ifo 
and the Federal Employment Agency suggest 
that employment will continue to expand sub -
stantially from the current high level.Construction

At a seasonally adjusted 2.79 million, registered 
unemployment remained largely stable in Au -
gust at the low level of the previous months. 
The unemployment rate remained unchanged 
at 6.4%. There were 106,000 fewer un -
employed persons than one year earlier, with 
the unemployment rate down by 0.3 percent -
age point. Total underemployment (excluding 
short- time work) was down again on the 
month. The labour market barometer of the In -
stitute for Employment  Research (IAB) im -
proved slightly in August and is consistent with 
stable or slightly declining unemployment in 
the next few months.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued their steep descent 
in August. On a monthly average, the US$ 
price for a barrel of Brent crude oil was down 
by around 16% on the July level, which is less 
than half of the prior- year figure. Prices stood 
at just over US$49 per barrel in the first half of 
September, with considerable fluctuations at 
times. As this report went to press, the price for 
a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$48½. 
The premium on crude oil futures was US$3½ 
for deliveries six months ahead and US$6¼ for 
deliveries 12 months ahead.
After seasonal adjustment, import prices de -
clined markedly in July compared with the pre -
vious month. This was due to the steep fall in 
imported energy prices as a result of lower 
crude oil prices. By contrast, prices of imported 
industrial goods showed no change. Domestic 
industrial producer prices also remained at the 
same level as in the previous month overall. In 
this case, the lower prices for the energy com -
ponent were just about offset by the slight rise 
in prices for other goods. The negative year- on- 
year figure increased to 1.7% in the case of im -
port prices but went down slightly to 1.3% in 
the case of industrial producer prices. Excluding 
energy, import prices recorded a relatively steep 
rise, with exchange rate developments prob -
ably playing a part in this. The year- on- year rate of increase was no longer quite as high overall 
as it was in June, but rose to 3.4% in the case 
of imported consumer goods.
Consumer prices in August showed a slight 
seasonally adjusted 0.1% decline compared 
with July. This was due to the steep fall in en -
ergy prices, which was, however, smaller than 
suggested by the decline in crude oil prices. By 
contrast, there was a marked increase in prices 
if energy is excluded. Consumers had to pay 
more for food products, as well as for industrial 
goods and services. In addition, rents con -
tinued their subdued upward trend. As in the 
previous month, the annual rate of consumer 
price inflation stood at 0.2% according to the 
national Consumer Price Index (CPI), and at 
0.1% as measured by the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP). If energy is excluded, 
however, the annual CPI rate rose from 1.0% 
to 1.1%.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance scheme re -
corded a deficit of €1½ billion in the second 
quarter of 2015. At first glance, this equates to 
a year- on- year financial improvement of €½ 
billion. However, adjusting this amount for the 
unevenly distributed payments of the central 
government grant in 20142 results in a deterior -
ation of €½ billion. At almost €½ billion, the Unemployment 
remains stable at a low level

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 A particularly large tranche in the first quarter was fol -
lowed by a particularly small one in the second. The central 
government grant was cut from €14.0 billion to €10.5 bil -
lion in 2014, but this change was only implemented with 
retroactive effect from the second quarter. The grant was 
€½ billion higher in the first six months of 2015 than in the 
same period of 2014 because it was raised to €11.5 billion 
for 2015 as a whole.Deutsche Bundesbank

health insurance institutions’ deficit remained 
broadly unchanged, whereas the health insur -
ance fund cut its deficit to just over €1 billion 
thanks to an injection of central government 
funds.
While transfers from the health insurance fund 
to the health insurance institutions were up by 
4½%, a significant decline in other revenue re -
sulted in a slightly weaker rise in total inflows 
(4%). Expenditure also increased by 4% overall, 
continuing a year- on- year slowdown in spend -
ing growth that has been observed over several 
quarters. Compared with the preceding quar -
ters, significantly more moderate rises in spend -
ing were recorded for therapeutic treatment 
and aids – which had recorded major increases 
last year, not least due to substantially higher 
fixed amounts for hearing aids – but also for 
sickness benefit. Expenditure on benefits 
climbed by a total of 4½%. Weaker overall 
spending growth was once again attributable 
to administrative expenditure, which edged up -wards by just over a mere 1%, but it was also 
affected by the discontinuation of premium 
payouts to insured persons, which have been 
prohibited since the start of 2015. Compared 
with the  expectations of the responsible group 
of statutory health insurance estimators in 
 autumn 2014, a somewhat more subdued rise 
in expenditure is now on the cards.
It was for the aforementioned reasons that the 
health insurance fund recorded a substantial 
revenue increase of just over 5½% in the 
second quarter of 2015. At 3½%, contribution 
receipts continued to record strong growth, 
 although it was slightly slower than in the first 
quarter. However, after adjustment for the 
lower average additional contribution rate of 
0.83% – compared with the uniform special 
contribution of 0.9% levied until the end of 
2014 – contributions would have risen by 
 almost 4%.3 This reflects the ongoing favour -
able employment and wage developments.
A discernible migrant- related expansion of the 
pool of insured persons has evidently not ma -
terialised to date, in part because asylum seek -
ers are initially not insured under the statutory 
health insurance scheme. Insofar as an increase 
in the number of insured persons is accompan -
ied by higher contribution receipts, the result -
ing overall effect on the financial balance of 
the statutory health insurance scheme will 
hinge on the scale of additional benefit claims 
in connection with this.4Recent slow-

3 The discontinuation of premium payouts to insured per -

4 Pursuant to section 266 (6) of the Fifth Book of the Social 
Security Code (Sozialgesetzbuch V), the health insurance 
fund pays preliminary transfers according to the number 
and health indicators of insured persons as at October of 
the preceding year. This is followed by a more precise cal -
culation based on the pool of insured persons as at Octo -
ber of the year under assessment once the health insur -
ance institutions’ actual annual figures have become avail -
able. However, this does not affect the total amount trans -
ferred by the fund for the year. Instead, the cost rates per 
insured person are adjusted where applicable in order to 
revise the distribution of funds to individual institutions as 
necessary.Deutsche Bundesbank

The group of statutory health insurance estima -
tors forecast a deficit of €2½ billion for the 
health insurance fund for 2015, which corres -
ponds to the gap between the reduced central 
government grant and the standard annual 
transfer of €14 billion and is to be financed 
from the fund’s reserves. However, given the 
employment and wage dynamics up to now, 
which have been somewhat more  favourable 
overall, the fund’s deficit could be smaller for 
the year as a whole. There are signs that 
growth in health insurance institutions’ ex -
penditure will be somewhat weaker, meaning 
that the predefined transfers from the health 
insurance fund could have been set at a level 
somewhat above the actual financing needs to 
be covered by this source. Consequently, this 
would cut the institutions’ deficit arising from 
lower additional contribution rates compared 
with the uniform special contribution rate pre -
viously levied. All in all, however, a year- on- 
year increase in the statutory health  insurance 
system’s deficit (2014: -€2½ billion) still ap -
pears possible.
Given a continuing trend increase in expend -
iture in excess of the growth in income subject 
to compulsory insurance contributions, add -
itional contribution rates are expected to climb 
on the whole in the years to come. Financial 
pressure is further intensifying in the face of 
current legislation, which provides for extra ex -
penditure in the areas of hospital treatment, 
palliative medicine and preventive care, in par -
ticular. While health insurance institutions’ re -
serves exceed the minimum level of one- quarter 
of a month’s average expenditure overall (total 
reserves recently reached just over €15 billion, 
or approximately 0.85 times the scheme’s 
monthly expenditure), this is only deferring 
 necessary rises in additional contribution rates. 
However, the reserves are unevenly distributed 
between the health insurance institutions and, 
consequently, several will have to adjust their 
additional contribution rates more quickly in 
order to meet increased spending needs.Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
 recorded a surplus of €½ billion in the second 
quarter of 2015, compared with a broadly bal -
anced result in the same period of 2014. The 
main driver behind this financial improvement 
was the fact that the contribution rate was 
raised from 2.05% to 2.35% (plus an extra 
0.25% in each case for childless persons) at the 
start of the year, but additional spending in 
connection with benefit increases was not yet 
on a par with the additional revenue that this 
generated. The additional revenue correspond -
ing to 0.1 percentage point of the contribution 
rate does not affect the balance in this calcula -
tion, as the transfers to the precautionary fund 
are recorded as spending by the public long-  
term care insurance scheme. Adjusted for the 
contribution rate rise, contribution receipts 
went up by just over 3½%; this is also attribut -Favourable

able to positive employment and wage devel -
opments.
A considerable surplus is expected for 2015 as 
a whole, not least because past experience has 
shown that a lag in claiming and paying out 
the additional benefits can be expected at first. 
The precautionary fund is set to build up re -
serves totalling €1¼ billion in its first year; 
these should then be used from 2035 onwards 
to lessen the contribution rate increases that 
will likely need to be implemented.
The Federal Government adopted the draft of a 
Second Act to Strengthen Long- term Care 
(Zweites Pflegestärkungsgesetz) in the summer 
of 2015. It represents a fundamental overhaul 
of benefits legislation. Under this reform, the 
three care levels currently in place are to be 
 replaced by five care grades, with cognitive or 
psychological impairments being considered 
equivalent to purely physical impairments with 
respect to the degree of long-  term care re -
quired. A safeguard clause has been included 
to ensure that benefits recipients do not experi -
ence any cuts as a result of the reform, which 
is scheduled to enter into force in 2017. Ac -
cording to the estimates presented in the draft 
legislation, the planned contribution rate in -
crease of 0.2 percentage point will be insuffi -
cient to fund benefit increases from the outset, 
meaning that general reserves (excluding the 
precautionary fund) will be depleted more rap -
idly and a further contribution rate hike will 
probably become necessary by no later than 
the early 2020s in order to fund current ex -
penditure. Passing this reform is likely to be 
 facilitated by the currently favourable growth in 
contribution receipts, but it will impose percep -
tibly larger burdens on future generations pay -
ing into the pay-  as- you- go system owing to 
unfavourable demographic trends.Securities markets
Bond market
At €117.7 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in July 2015 was up on the June 
figure (€90.1 billion). However, after taking 
 account of increased redemptions (€122.3 bil -
lion) and changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own bonds, the outstanding volume of domes -
tic bonds recorded a net decline of €3.0 billion 
after having contracted by €25.7 billion in June. 
By contrast, foreign instruments worth €3.1 bil -
lion were placed in the German market (com -
pared with €2.7 billion in June), so that the ag -
gregate outstanding volume of both domestic 
and foreign debt instruments in Germany rose 
by €0.1 billion on balance.
The public sector redeemed own bonds total -
ling €5.3 billion net in the reporting month. 
Central government, in particular, reduced its 
capital market debt on balance (€10.5 billion). 
It mainly redeemed ten- year Bunds (€18.3 bil -
lion). This was partly offset by net issuances, 
chiefly of five- year Bobls and two- year Schätze 
(€4.6 billion and €2.5 billion respectively). State 
governments issued bonds worth €5.3 billion 
net.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds total -
ling €0.6 billion net in July. On balance, they 
issued exclusively mortgage Pfandbriefe (€3.3 
billion), whereas there were net redemptions of 
public Pfandbriefe (€1.0 billion), other banks 
debt securities, which can be structured flexibly 
(€0.9 billion) and debt securities of specialised 
credit institutions (which also include public 
promotional banks) (€0.8 billion).
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises issued debt securities worth €1.7 billion 
net. On balance, this was solely attributable to 
other financial intermediaries, while non-  
financial corporations redeemed bonds.

of the Eurosystem asset purchase programmes, 
credit institutions focused on instruments 
 issued by domestic enterprises. This contrasted 
with net sales on the part of domestic non-  
banks (€12.9 billion) and foreign investors 
(€11.7 billion).
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares total -
ling €0.5 billion net were issued in the German 
equity market, the bulk of which was ac -
counted for by listed enterprises. The sale of 
foreign shares on the German market rose by 
€4.0 billion in the same period. Domestic non- 
banks were the main purchasers, adding stocks 
worth €6.5 billion net to their portfolios. Resi -
dent credit institutions acquired equities in the 
amount of €1.3 billion, whereas non- resident 
investors sold domestic shares worth €3.3 bil -
lion on balance.
Mutual funds
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded rather 
low inflows of €2.2 billion. On balance, these 
fresh resources flowed exclusively into mutual 
funds open to the general public (€2.9 billion). 
Among the individual investment asset classes, 
share- based funds benefited most (€2.6 bil -
lion), whereas mixed securities- based funds re -
corded outflows (€1.0 billion). Foreign mutual 
investment funds sold share units totalling €4.8 
billion net in the German market. On balance, 
domestic non- banks were virtually the only 
purchasers of mutual fund shares in the report -
ing month (€5.3 billion). Domestic credit insti -
tutions and foreign investors purchased mutual 
fund units worth €1.3 billion and €0.4 billion 
net respectively.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €23.4 billion in July 2015. The result was 
€0.9 billion down on the level of the previous 
month. This was due to an increase in the 
 deficit on invisible current transactions, which 
comprise services as well as primary and sec -
ondary income. By contrast, the surplus in the 
goods account increased marginally.
The surplus in the goods account increased by 
€0.2 billion to €25.7 billion in July thanks to a 
somewhat larger absolute increase in German 
exports of goods in the face of a parallel in -
crease in imports of goods.
In July, the deficit on invisible current transac -
tions went up by €1.2 billion on the month to 
€2.3 billion. This increase arose almost entirely 
from changes to the services sub- account, 
which saw its deficit widen by €2.5 billion to Negligible net

€6.3 billion. To some extent, this development 
was attributable to reduced receipts from IT 
services and from R&D activities, but it was pri -
marily due to a seasonally- induced increase in 
travel expenditure. The secondary income def -
icit likewise took an upward turn, albeit moder -
ately, rising by €0.1 billion to €2.4 billion. In 
contrast to this, the primary income balance 
recorded a marked increase in net receipts, 
which rose by €1.4 billion to €6.4 billion, not 
least on account of lower dividend payments 
to foreign investors.
In July, the international financial markets were 
at times clouded by growing uncertainty about 
how events might unfold in Greece and future 
developments in the Chinese stock market. 
With regard to German capital flows, the Euro -
system’s asset purchase programme also 
proved significant. Against this backdrop, Ger -
man cross- border portfolio investment gener -
ated net capital exports amounting to €25.8 
billion. Domestic investors bought foreign 
 securities worth €11.3 billion net, mainly in the 
form of investment fund shares (€4.8 billion), 
and long- term debt securities (€4.1 billion), 
with an emphasis on euro- denominated bonds 
(€2.5 billion). They also invested in foreign 
shares to the tune of €3.4 billion. By contrast, 
this group of investors parted with small quan -
tities of money market paper issued abroad 
(€1.0 billion). On balance, foreign investment in 
German securities was down by €14.6 billion. 
For the most part, non-  resident investors dis -
posed of public- sector bonds (€13.8 billion), 
while also divesting shares (€3.3 billion) and 
bonds issued by the private sector (€2.5 bil -
lion). At the same time, however, they acquired 
German money market paper totalling €4.6 bil -
lion. During the period under review, no great 
interest was shown in investment fund shares 
as an investment instrument.
In July, direct investment generated net capital 
exports in the amount of €8.5 billion. German 
enterprises expanded their investment abroad

result of transactions. Domestic enterprises 
provided their foreign affiliates with additional 
equity capital (€2.6 billion) while also moder -
ately boosting their intra- group cross- border 
lending by means of financial loans (€0.4 bil -
lion). Parallel to this, the volume of trade credit 
remained unchanged in net terms. The reduced 
level of direct investment by non- residents in 
Germany was largely the result of €4.8 billion 
worth of net redemptions relating to credit 
transactions. The diminished amount of equity 
capital in German enterprises was only of minor 
significance (€0.7 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising loans and trade credits (where these do

July. In this context, the increase in liabilities 
(€28.1 billion) exceeded the build- up of assets 
(€8.7 billion). Monetary financial institutions 
 recorded net inflows of funds from abroad 
amounting to €20.7 billion while enterprises 
and households saw net capital imports total -
ling €6.0 billion. By contrast, both the German 
government and the Bundesbank recorded net 
capital exports (€2.0 billion and €5.4 billion

Recent developments in loans to euro-  ar ea 
non- financial corporations
The financial and sovereign debt crisis triggered a slump in bank lending to non-  financial corpor -
ations in the euro area to which the Eurosystem responded with an array of non-  standar d mon -
etary policy measures. Loan developments began to stabilise in mid-2013 and have improved 
distinctly since the autumn of 2014. But the aggregate data conceal what remain considerable 
country-  specific differ ences in loan developments. This article outlines the recovery process across 
the euro area and analyses the causes of the persistent differences in loan growth in the four 
largest euro-  ar ea countries.
What the four countries have in common is they are all experiencing an economic recovery to a 
greater or lesser degree that is now stimulating credit growth. Yet deeper analyses suggest that 
lending in Spain and possibly in Italy, too, has been weaker by historical standards, while loan 
developments in Germany and France have been consistent with past patterns. Two main reasons 
why such differences exist are the need for the non-  financial private sector to r educe debt over -
hangs built up before the crisis, and the problems the crisis caused for the banking systems.
While both factors tended to dampen loan dynamics in periphery countries in recent years, their 
influence is likely to be much less noticeable of late. Thus, Spanish businesses have appreciably cut their debt overhang since 2012, a process which has recently been given additional traction by the country’s robust economic upswing. What is more, the available indicators suggest overall 
that negative bank-  specific factors ar e now impacting much less materially on lending in Italy 
and Spain.
However, persistently high levels of non-  performing loans ar e continuing to drag on earnings and 
capital levels across both countries’ banking systems. The need to reduce these vulnerabilities is a task facing both the banks themselves as well as banking supervisors and fiscal policymakers.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
Bank lending has exceptional macroeconomic 
importance in the euro area, for two reasons. 
First, households borrow almost exclusively 
from domestic banks. Second, bank loans are a 
key source of debt financing for non-  financial  
corporations – much more so than in the Eng -
lish- speaking world.1 So a bank lending squeeze 
can potentially amplify an existing cyclical 
weakness or obstruct a nascent recovery in the 
real economy, with the corresponding adverse 
effects for price stability. Furthermore, price 
stability may also be jeopardised by the inter -
actions between bank lending and asset prices.
It follows that analyses of bank lending to the 
private sector and of its determinants play a 
key role in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
strategy, geared as it is to safeguarding price 
stability. Lending to the euro area’s non-  
financial private sector was notably highlighted 
by its steep and abrupt decline in 2008-09, 
which was exacerbated by the sovereign debt 
crisis, particularly in the periphery countries. 
The situation has since eased to the extent that 
the fall in lending – consistent with develop -
ments in the real economy – has bottomed 
out. Thus, bank lending in the euro area stabil -
ised from mid-2013 and began to recover in 
autumn 2014. Yet loan growth remains muted at an annualised rate of no more than +1.4% in 
July 2015.
2 
This article outlines the recovery process that has been underway over the past two years 
and also seeks to explain why there are persist -
ent differences in loan growth at country level. 
Since patterns observed in the four largest 
euro-  ar ea countries can explain much of the 
euro area’s aggregate development in terms of 
both loan volumes and loan dynamics, this 
 article focuses on comparing and contrasting 
the recovery process in these four countries.Broad recovery process
The breakdown of loans to the non-  fi nancial 
private sector (see the chart on page 17) shows 
that the upswing in lending to households and 
to non-  financial corpor ations commenced at 
roughly the same time. As far as lending to households is concerned, the upturn was 
fuelled almost entirely by loans for house pur -
chase; since 2014 consumer credit, too, has 
been buoyed by the pick-  up in private con -
sumption in the euro area. But growth in loans 
to households remains modest on balance at an annual growth rate of 1.9%. Given that 
household borrowing has registered consistent 
growth in recent years, it may be concluded 
that the slump in loans to the non-  financial pri -
vate sector, as well as the pace of the subse -
quent upturn, were driven primarily by lending 
to non-  financial corpor ations. That is why this 
article focuses on corporate borrowing.
The recovery in lending to non-  financial corpor -
ations affected almost all maturities, sectors 
and countries but to differing degrees. As far as 
maturities were concerned, the recovery fol -
lowed the usual cyclical pattern in that short 
and medium-  term loans up to five years initial ly 
contributed perceptibly to the rise in corporate 
loans from 2013 onwards (see the chart on 
page 17). But long-  term loans, too, have mean -
while stopped making a negative contribution 
to credit growth.Bank lending

2 This article uses the hitherto customary definition of 
loans adjusted for sales and securitisation. On 21 Septem -
ber 2015 the European Central Bank published new data 
series using an enhanced method for adjusting loans for 
sales and securitisation; this method will be applied both to 
euro-  a rea aggregates and to national data series. The 
broad recovery in loans to the non-  financial private sector 
will remain evident after taking account of the data 
 revisions.Deutsche Bundesbank

As for economic sectors, industry reclaimed its 
role as the main driver of lending growth in the 
euro area in the fourth quarter of 2014.3 This 
probably reflects the renewed, albeit hesitant, 
upturn in industrial output that has been ob -
served since the end of 2012. Lending to the 
real estate and other services sectors, which 
had dragged down the aggregate figure during 
the global financial crisis, at least stopped hold -
ing back overall lending developments from 
the end of 2013.
The country breakdown likewise indicates that 
the recovery in lending is becoming increas -
ingly broad-  based (see the chart on page 18). 
Thus, almost half of all the euro-  ar ea member 
states are now once again showing positive 
 annual growth rates in lending to non-  financial 
corporations. In each of the four largest euro-  
area countries (Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain) the contribution of loans to firms to the 
annual growth rate in the euro area has in -
creased distinctly since the beginning of 2014. 
Moreover, country-  specific differ ences in lend -
ing patterns have also diminished during the 
recovery process. The dispersion of national 
growth contributions to the overall loan dy -
namics has contracted appreciably since the 
trough in lending developments in 2013.
Country-  specific differ ences nonetheless con -
tinue to feature strongly in lending patterns. 
While Spain and Italy were still running nega -
tive (albeit improving) annual growth rates of 
-2.4% and -0.9% respectively in July this year, 
that same metric climbed to +5.5% in France. 
In Germany, by contrast, loans to non-  financial 
corporations supported overall credit growth in 
the euro area with only a modest year-  on-  year 
growth rate of +0.6%.
Lending developments 
in a cyclical context
Developments in real economic activity are a 
key determinant of credit growth. Cyclical up -
turns usually generate a rise in both credit de-mand and credit supply because, for example, 
improving corporate profitability and collateral 
valuations make lending a less risky undertak -
ing for banks.
The hypothesis that there is a close and stable 
relationship between lending and develop-
ments in the real sector is supported by the 
wavelet analysis for all four major euro-  ar ea 
countries shown in the box on pages 20 to 22.

tionship between annual growth rates of real 
MFI lending to non-  financial corpor ations and 
annual real GDP growth rates in Germany,4 
France, Italy and Spain show that the two vari-
ables display strong coherence for oscillations 
over business cycle periods. Loan growth tends 
to lag real GDP growth by between two and six 
quarters, depending on the country in question 
and the point in time.
The time-  lag of r eal loan growth vis-  à-  vis r eal 
GDP growth found in the analysis is generally 
reflected for the individual member states in 
the current upturn (see the chart on page 19). However, a number of differences are apparent 
between the individual countries. For one thing, the (real) rate of lending growth in 
France has meanwhile overtaken GDP growth 
again, in line with past upswings. In Germany, 
by contrast, the solid economic upturn has so 
far been accompanied by only a very muted in -
crease in loans to non-  financial corpor ations, 
which means that the real growth rate of lend-ing is still in negative territory. Similarly, in 
Spain, which is currently experiencing a robust 
pick- up in economic activity , and Italy, where 
the annual GDP growth rate edged back above 
zero at the beginning of 2015, loan growth per 
se has been comparatively frail relative to the 
growth rates posted over the last decades.
This observation is explored in greater detail in 
the box on pages 23 to 27, which includes a 
comparison, for Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain, of actual growth rates in lending to the 
non- financial corpor ate sector5 with a hypo -
thetical loan growth rate that would have been 
expected given the observed business cycle de -
velopments and the past correlations between lending and the business cycle. In this box, the Real economic

hypothetical credit development is simulated 
using an empirical model which maps the dy -
namic interaction between lending and other 
macroeconomic variables (output, price level, 
monetary policy rate, money supply, loans and 
government bond interest rates).6 To investi-
gate loan developments in the course of the 
financial and sovereign debt crisis, the starting 
point for the simulations is set in the third quar -
ter of 2008, a period in which the global finan-
cial crisis flared up with the collapse of US 
invest  ment bank Lehman Br others. To control 
for the actual business cycle development when deriving the hypothetical loan growth path, the simulations are conditioned on the 
realised data for real GDP and the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).
All in all, the results of the analysis support the 
view that from mid-2008 onwards, loans made 
by German and French banks to the corporate 
sector largely followed the cyclical patterns 
that had been observed in the past. Taking due account of estimation and forecast uncertainty, 
the loan growth rates for these two countries 
during the observation period do not deviate 
substantially from the path that would have 
been expected solely on the basis of the histor -
ical correlations with output and the price level. The much stronger loan growth in France than 
in Germany coupled with flatter GDP growth 
can be attributed to structural differences in 
the availability of alternative sources of funding 
in both countries.7

6 The model is essentially similar to those commonly used 
for analysing the monetary transmission process and the 
effects of macroeconomic shocks (eg the effects of credit 
shocks).7 As the Monthly Report for November 2014 explains, the 
ample internal funding sources of German non-  financial  
corporations have long outstripped their still-  muted capital 
formation; mirroring this, their demand for bank loans and 
other external financing instruments is fairly limited. Non-  
financial corporations in France, on the other hand, have 
for years now been much more reliant on external funding to finance their investment. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Dif -
ferences in dynamics of loans to non-  financial corpor ations

Results of a wavelet analysis examining the relationship 
 between lending to non- fi  nancial corporati ons and real  economic  activity in Germany, France, Italy and Spain
The relationship between cycles of bank 
lending and real economic activity can be examined by applying procedures used in 
spectral analysis. These show, among other 
things, which frequencies are signifi  cant in 
contributing to the variance of a given time 
series, the strength of the relationship be-
tween cycles of equal length in the case of 
two variables and whether the two cycles display a phase shift, ie one leads or lags 
the other.
This text presents the results of a wavelet analysis. Unlike standard spectral analysis which presumes stable relationships over time, a wavelet analysis allows the re-
searcher to investigate changes in the em-
pirical relationships between the two vari-
ables, both with respect to the frequencies 
being observed (ie for fl  uctuations with 
periods of different length) and over time.1 
The time series are approximated using fl  ex-
ible functions (known as wavelets), which 
are stretched or compressed depending on 
the frequency under examination. Time variability is captured by estimating the 
wavelets via windows of observation, with 
the length of the window adapted to the 
frequency under examination.
This approach was applied to investigate 
the relationship between the annual growth 
rate of real loans to non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations and annual real GDP growth in Ger-many, France, Italy and Spain.
2 The estima-
tion period starts in the fi  rst quarter of 1982 and ends in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 
chart on page 21 shows the estimated wavelet coherence between the two time series over time for the individual country and for two selected frequency ranges in each case. The degree of coherence is a measure of the local correlation between two time series, or in other words, of the 
strength of their relationship.3 The analysis 
in question is purely descriptive and says 
nothing about causalities.
The relationship between the two variables 
on business cycle frequencies is captured by focussing on periodicities between two and 
ten years.4 For the purpose of measuring 
shifts over time within the frequency range under observation, once again a distinction 
was made between fl  uctuations with a 
1 Wavelet analyses represent an alternative to stand-
ard Fourier analysis which presumes unchanged rela-
tionships over time or to rolling Fourier analysis which 
depicts time variability using a rolling window of fi  xed 
length that does not depend on the frequency under 
examination. In contrast to rolling Fourier analysis, a 
wavelet analysis provides superior time resolution for 
high frequency fl  uctuations and improved frequency 
resolution for low frequencies. For an introduction to 
wavelet analysis, see A Rua (2012), Wavelets in eco-
nomics, Economic Bulletin, Summer, Banco de Portu-
gal, pp  71-79; L Aguiar- Conraria and M J Soares

Surveys, 28, pp 344-375. Regarding a standard spec-
tral analysis of the relationship between lending to 
non- fi  nancial corporations and GDP/investment in Ger-many, see Deutsche Bundesbank, German banks’ lend-ing to the domestic private sector since summer 2009, Monthly Report, September 2011, pp 59-78.2 The data representing loans are the national contri-
butions to the euro- area aggregate. To this end, an index series is constructed. Up to 1996 this was de-
rived from stocks but from 1997/ 2009 onward it has 
been based on transaction- related changes or changes additionally adjusted for loan sales and securitisations. The series was defl  ated using the implicit GDP defl  ator.
3 For all the countries concerned, the wavelet power 
spectrum shows important cycles on the frequencies 
under consideration for both lending and GDP growth rates.

length of between two and six years and 
those of between six and ten years. These 
periodicities were selected on the basis of a 
detailed analysis of different parts of the 
frequency range in question.
Overall, the results shown in the chart 
above point to a pronounced cyclical rela-
tionship between the annual growth rates 
of real loans to non- fi  nancial corporations 
and the corresponding growth rates of real 
GDP at business cycle frequencies. How-
ever, there are country- specifi  c differences 
over time and differences in the relative im-
portance of individual frequency ranges. 
Notwithstanding this, at almost every point 
in time there is a maximum coherence for 
one of the observed frequency ranges of 
0.8 or above.
It is apparent that in Germany, France and 
Spain the relationship exhibited by fl  uctu-
ations with a six- to- ten- year period is more pronounced for most of the sample ana-lysed here than in the case of fl  uctuations 
with a two- to- six- year period, while for Italy 
the opposite holds true.5 Moreover, in the 
case of the fi  rst three countries listed, the coherence in the longer frequency range 
exhibits a greater degree of stability.
The lead- lag relationship of real loan growth 
and real GDP growth at the selected fre-
quencies is estimated using the phase or time difference.
6 As regards fl  uctuations 
with periodicities of between six and ten 
years, the time difference indicates a lag of lending growth compared with GDP growth of four to fi  ve quarters, six to eight quarters 
and two to three quarters for France, Italy 
5 In France, the coherences for both frequency ranges 
stand at roughly the same level in the second half of 
the 1990s.
6 The wavelet analysis allows for time variability in 
phase and time differences. The time difference corres-
ponds to the phase difference divided by the fre-
quency.Wavelet coherence between the annual growth rate of real loans to non-financial

Unlike Germany and France, the simulated re -
sults for Spain and, with qualifications and de -
pending on the estimation period, for Italy, too, 
indicate that actual business lending has been 
lower than would have been expected from 
the historical correlations. In Spain’s case, how -
ever, the view based on aggregate data masks 
a macroeconomic restructuring process that 
has shifted resources from credit-  intensive eco -
nomic activities like construction to less credit-  
centric sectors.8 This process has been accom-
panied by a reallocation of lending volumes 
within the corporate sector. A decomposition 
of lending by economic activity reveals that loans to the real estate industry, which was 
booming in the pre-  crisis er a, have shrunk more 
than in other sectors since 2009 and are still 
contracting appreciably today. By contrast, an -
nual growth rates for loans to industry and the 
non- r eal-  estate-  r elated services sector are now 
back close to zero (see the chart on page 28). 
In light of the research presented in the box on 
pages 23 to 27, this can mean that model pro -jections based on a country’s past economic 
structure may overstate the projected lending 
growth rate for a given economic growth rate. 
Although in this case of macroeconomic re -
structuring the lending pattern merely follows 
the normal cyclical correlations, the charts on 
pages  24 and 25 would point to a gap be -
tween the actual and hypothetical rates of 
credit growth and thus imply that the pace of 
credit growth is too low.
The selected empirical approach does not allow 
a detailed analysis of what causes the devi -
ations observed in Italy and Spain between ac -
tual and hypothetical loan growth.9 The section 
below therefore considers several aspects 
which have featured prominently in the debate … but lending 
growth in Spain and Italy too weak relative to real economic developmentsand Spain respectively. Turning to Germany, 
the lag of lending widened from about two 
quarters at the end of the 1980s to about 
six quarters by the middle of the fi  rst dec-
ade of the 2000s. In the case of Italy, fl  uc-
tuations with two- to- six- year periodicities, which demonstrate a greater coherence with real GDP growth than fl  uctuations with six- to- ten year periodicities, exhibit a 
lag of about one to three quarters.7
If, instead of real GDP , real gross fi  xed cap-ital formation or real investment in machin-
ery and equipment is used as a gauge of real economic activity, this delivers similar 
results with respect to the measured coher-ences and time differences. Overall, the re-
sults presented here thus point to a close and relatively stable relationship over time between loan growth and business cycle 
developments.87 For details of possible causes of such a lag, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), loc cit, p  69. For ex-
ample, during an economic upturn enterprises can ini-
tially meet their funding requirements using internally 
available resources, meaning that they will not in-
crease their demand for loans until a later date.
8 Compared with the results of the spectral analysis of 
loans to non- fi  nancial corporations in Germany (see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), loc cit), the wavelet an-alysis produces somewhat greater coherences. In other 
words, it shows a stronger correlation between loan 
growth and GDP or investment growth. The time dif-ferences estimated using the wavelet analysis are con-sistent with the previously presented results which did 
not assume any time variability. However, they do 
point to an increase in the lag over time.

sources in the Spanish economy, Annual Report 2014,

Developments in loans to non- fi  nancial corporations 
from the perspective of a multi- country BVAR model
While economic activity in the euro area 
has recorded moderate growth since spring 
2013, the pace of loan growth has re-
mained weak. The close correlation be-
tween lending and real economic develop-
ments on the one hand, and the lag in lending on the other – as shown in the 
wavelet analysis in the box on pages 20 to 22 – could, however, indicate that an accel-
eration of loan growth might be on the 
cards. This raises the question as to whether, 
given the cyclical environment, the ob-served lending growth follows the normal 
cyclical pattern. To establish whether or not this is the case, the following analysis com-pares actual loan developments with hypo-
thetical loan developments. The latter are derived from correlations observed in the past between loans and econom ic condi-
tions using a quantitative economic model. If the model is able to provide a suffi   ciently precise picture of the correlations between 
lending and its relevant determinants, it is then possible to examine to what extent 
the lending developments observed in real-
ity deviate from the counterfactual simula-
tion, ie from the developments that would 
have been expected based on the relation-ships between lending and its determinants 
contained in the model. This deviation can 
then be interpreted as an indication that 
current lending developments might exhibit 
peculiarities, which can, in turn, be ana-
lysed in greater detail, particularly with re-
gard to the underlying causes and their 
macroeconomic implications.
A vector autoregressive model is selected for the analysis, which takes into account 
potential interactions between all the vari-
ables included in the model.1 In order to 
 refl  ect the heterogeneity of lending devel-opments in the major euro- area member 
states, a multi- country model is used, with 
the aim of empirically mapping the devel-
opments of MFI loans along with the devel-
opments of other relevant macroeconomic 
variables in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The selection of the vector auto-regressive model means that interactions 
between the countries are possible.
The model contains a total of 25 variables, including the following variables for each 
country: real gross domestic product (GDP), 
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP), the national contribution to the mon-
etary aggregate M3 in the euro area, the  national contribution to MFI loans to non- fi  nancial corporations in the euro area, an 
average interest rate for these loans and the yield on ten- year government bonds. In add-ition, EONIA is taken into account as a mon-
etary policy indicator.2 The estimation is car-
ried out using Bayesian methods (Bayesian 
1 In principle, a variety of different models can be used 
to construct these fi  ctitious loan developments which 
act as a benchmark. They vary, inter alia, with regard 
to the strength of the assumptions they make con-
cerning structural economic relationships, which is of 
relevance when interpreting the extent to which actual 
loan developments deviate from the fi  ctitious ones. In 
the absence of suffi   ciently strong structural assump-tions, it is not possible to interpret the deviations as the outcome of certain economically interpretable 
shocks. For example, dynamic stochastic general equi-
librium (DSGE) models make very strong assumptions 
about economic structural relationships. By contrast, 
the model applied here does not include any assump-
tions regarding the structural interpretation of the 
shocks owing to the number of variables it contains.2 For the period before 1999, EONIA is replaced by a 
German interbank interest rate for overnight credit. The variables are selected broadly in line with C Al-
tavilla, D Giannone and M Lenza (2014), The fi  nancial and macroeoconomic effects of OMT announcements, European Central Bank, Working Paper Series No 1707. 
There are differences, inter alia, with regard to the 
 selection of the credit aggregate and the inclusion of 
lending rates rather than yields on short- term govern-ment bonds.Deutsche Bundesbank

vector autoregression, or BVAR).3 All the vari-
ables enter the model in levels.4 The lag order 
is fi  ve. The estimation period for the model 
runs from the second quarter of 1996 to the 
second quarter of 2008.5 The estimation thus 
refl  ects the correlations between the model 
variables prior to the fi  nancial market crisis.
On the basis of this estimated relationship, 
developments in MFI loans to non- fi  nancial corporations are then simulated in the four 
countries beginning with the third quarter 
of 2008. The simulations are conditional on actual developments in real GDP and HICP , enabling the impact of actual economic de-velopments on lending to be recorded.
6 The 
lending simulations measured in terms of levels of loans are then converted into 
3 The estimation methodology follows D Giannone, 
M Lenza and G Primiceri (2015), Prior selection for vec-
tor autoregressions, Review of Economics and Statistics, 
97, pp 436-451. A hierarchical prior distribution is as-
sumed which combines prior distributions of the hyper-parameters with standard prior distributions (normal- in-
verse- Wishart) for the VAR parameters conditional on 
the priors for the hyperparameters. The large number of parameters included in the VAR model and the relatively 
short estimation period mean that the choice of the prior distribution has an impact on the results. In the 
present analysis, the conditional prior distribution of the 
VAR model parameters was specifi  ed in accordance 
with the Minnesota prior and combined with a “sums 
of coeffi   cients prior” and an “initial dummy observa-
tions prior”. See R Litterman (1980), A Bayesian proced-
ure for forecasting with vector autoregressions, Work-
ing Paper, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; 
T Doan, R Litterman and C Sims (1984), Forecasting and conditional projection using realistic prior distributions, 
Econometric Reviews, 3, pp 1-100; C Sims (1993), A nine- variable probabilistic macroeconomic forecasting 
model, in J Stock and M Watson (eds), Business cycles, indicators and forecasting, University of Chicago Press, 
pp  179-204; C Sims and T Zha (1998), Bayesian 
methods for dynamic multivariate models, International Economic Review, 39, pp 949-968.4 Some of the variables used are normally considered 
to be non- stationary. In principle, the prior distribu-tions permit common stochastic trends for the vari-ables, ie they do not automatically exclude potential 
cointegration relationships.
5 The estimation period ends before the collapse of 
Lehman Brothers (September 2008), which marked 
the fi  rst dramatic episode of the international fi  nancial 
crisis. The start of the estimation period was deter-
mined by the availability of harmonised data.
6 This means that money supply, loans, lending rates, 
government bond yields and EONIA are forecast dy-
namically using the estimated model relationships, but 
that their changes are at the same time infl  uenced by 
exogenously given output and price patterns and there-fore differ from an unconditional dynamic forecast. The conditional forecast is computed by means of the state- 
space representation using the Kalman fi  lter and the Carter- Kohn algorithm. See M Bańbura, D Giannone 
and M Lenza (2015), Conditional forecasts and scenario analysis with vector autoregressions for large cross sec-tions, International Journal of Forecasting, 31, pp 739-756. The deviations are not necessarily only caused by 
shocks affecting those variables that were not condi-
tioned on for the forecast. The fact that the forecast is 
conditional on output and prices does not preclude 
shocks affecting these variables contemporaneously in-fl  uencing other variables, too, and thus having a direct 
or indirect impact on the credit aggregates without 
being controlled for. This is because the forecasts take the VAR model in its estimated reduced form as a basis. Consequently, a structural identifi  cation of the model is not required but, at the same time, deviations from the forecasts cannot be decomposed into the contributions of economically interpretable shocks.Conditional forecasts of the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations (estimation up to 2008)

 annual growth rates to aid visualisation. 
The chart on page 24 shows the distribu-tion of the conditional forecasts of MFI 
loans to non- fi  nancial corporations as well 
as the  actual annual growth rates broken 
down by country. The forecast distribution 
is represented by the median and selected 
percentiles.7 By comparing actual loan 
growth with the forecast distribution, it can be ascertained whether loan growth, meas-
ured in terms of the forecast distribution, 
has been particularly strong or weak.
According to these results, loan growth in 
Germany and France (during the forecast 
period) was largely in line with past regular-ities. By contrast, the lending developments observed in Italy, and most notably in Spain, are unusually weak – measured in terms of 
the historical correlations between loan 
 developments on the one hand and actual 
developments in real GDP and HICP on the other (since mid-2010 and the end of 2009, respectively).
However, it cannot be ruled out that the 
 selected estimation period and/or the start-ing point for the simulation have biased the results. Setting the third quarter of 2008 as the starting point means that the deviation 
between the actual and hypothetical loan 
developments for the second quarter is im-
plicitly set at zero. If, however – measured 
in terms of the long- term relationship be-tween the lending volume and the other 
variables – the loan volume was already ex-cessive at this point in time, the weak lend-ing developments relative to the simulation 
could potentially entirely or partially refl  ect 
the reduction of this loan overhang, ie a de-leveraging process.
Furthermore, the comparison of the actual lending developments with the distribution 
of the conditional forecasts is based on the 
assumption that the estimated model maps the “normal” correlations between the 
model variables. This assumption may not be met if there have been persistent deviations from the “normal” common development of 
the variables during the estimation period. For instance, the estimation period used here covers the credit boom phase in the 
years running up to the crisis, which means 
that the model parameters partially refl  ect

the adjustment to this strong credit expan-
sion. The simulated loan developments 
could therefore have an upward bias.8
To get an idea of whether this potential bias 
of the simulations owing to the credit boom 
in the mid-2000s is a relevant factor, the model was additionally estimated for the 
period from the third quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 2004 and simulated from the fi  rst quarter of 2005, with the forecasts once again being conditional on actual de-
velopments in real GDP and HICP .9 As the 
crisis period is not included in the estima-
tion, there is also no danger of the model 
estimation being biased downwards by a crisis- induced structural break. In Italy, ac-
tual lending growth rates are initially in line 
with the median of the simulations, but 
drop noticeably short of it during the sover-eign debt crisis. In Spain, actual loan growth 
initially strongly outpaces the forecasts based on output and price developments from 2005 onward, causing a loan over-hang to build up. However, beginning in 
2008, loan growth falls below the median 
and slides towards the lower tail of the forecast distribution.
10 This is consistent 
with the hypothesis that the weak loan 
 developments in recent years could fully or 
partially refl  ect a correction of the loan overhangs that had accumulated in the past. However, a comparison of the levels 
of the actual and forecast loan aggregates 
reveals that the decline in the lending vol-
ume in Spain might have gone beyond cor-recting the already existing loan overhang.
Yet the fact that the estimation period lies 
further back in time increases the risk of 
structural changes in the economies having 
occurred in the meantime and thus of the 
model parameters no longer accurately de-
scribing the currently relevant correlation 
between the variables. To address this risk, 
the model was additionally estimated for the period from the fi  rst quarter of 1996 to 
the fourth quarter of 2014. The chart on page 25 shows actual loan developments 
and the distribution of the forecasts condi-
tional on output and price developments, 
as obtained from the model estimation for 
the period from the second quarter of 1996 
to the fourth quarter of 2014, ie from the 
 estimation including the crisis period. This is 
based on the assumption that the crisis 
does not produce a structural break in the 
model and that the “normal” correlations between the variables can be accurately 
 recorded on average by taking into account the boom and bust phases.
The results show that the loan growth ob-
served in Germany and France is close to the median of the conditional forecasts through-out the entire forecast period.
11 For Italy, too, 
the deviations grow smaller in size and the 
loan growth rates observed are in the central 
area of the forecast distribution, although 
the loan growth rate since the end of 2011 
has been somewhat below the median of the forecast distribution. The deviation of 
8 For example, a credit boom can result in an upward 
bias of the estimated elasticity of the lending volume 
with respect to output. In such a case, a simulation 
that is conditional on the output path would ceteris 
paribus result in an overstated contraction in the loan volume in the period when output slumped during the crisis and an overstated expansion in the loan volume in the ensuing period of recovery.9 The time series used for the Italian lending rate is not available in full for this period and had to be replaced by another time series which merely records the inter-est rates on short- term corporate loans.
10 Comparable results in qualitative terms were ob-
tained in a simulation experiment using a similar BVAR 
model in: European Central Bank, Extensions to the 
models for assessing money and credit, Monthly Bul-
letin, February 2014, pp  77-96. In this experiment, 
however, the forecasts are conditional on the realised values of all other model variables and not – as is the case in the analysis presented here – only on develop-ments in real GDP and HICP in each country.11 As the estimation period covers the vast majority of 
the simulation period, the simulations now predomin-
antly comprise conditional in- sample forecasts. The dif-ference compared with the fi  tted values in the model is 
that in the simulations only real GDP and HICP are given, whereas the fi  tted values would be computed 
based on the lagged actual values of all variables.Deutsche Bundesbank

on the lacklustre growth of bank lending in 
these two countries. Discussions over what 
caused the slump in business loans in 2012 and 
2013 were dominated at that time by two main 
topics – the role played by supply-  side con-
straints, and the deleveraging process in the 
Spanish business sector.10 Hence, the following 
analysis investigates how far these two topics 
have continued to affect lending patterns in the countries under observation up to the 
present time.
Progress in non-  financial 
 corporations’ deleveraging
As discussed in earlier Monthly Report articles, 
one of the key constraints holding back credit 
demand in the Spanish non-  financial private  
sector in recent years was the need to correct 
the debt overhang that had accumulated in the 
past.11 Thus, non-  fi nancial corporations’ un -
consolidated debt ratio – a metric comprising a wide range of liabilities and showing the sum 
of loans, debt securities and pension reserves as a percentage of GDP  – has contracted 
sharply since mid-2010, after being greatly 
 inflated by a sustained pre-  c risis credit boom 
and the consequent property price bubble (see the chart on page 28).
12 As a result of this, the 
deleveraging process focused on cutting bank 
borrowing.13 In 2012 and 2013, despite the un-
favourable economic setting, Spanish firms 
managed to partly replace their bank loans, 
Spanish firms 
much less lever-aged since 2012 actual lending developments from the distri-
bution of the conditional forecast is also 
smaller than in the chart on page 24 in the 
case of Spain. However, from 2011 onward, 
the observed loan growth rate has increas-
ingly diverged from the median of the fore-cast distribution, and since the start of 2014 
it has been close to the 16th percentile. Al-
though the deviation is thus less extreme than in the previous simulation, the results 
nevertheless indicate that lending dynamics 
observed in Spain are weaker than would be 
expected based on the estimated correl-ations and output and price level develop-
ments.
Overall, the results indicate that the dynam-
ics of German and French banks’ loans to 
the corporate sector observed in recent years are in line with the historical correl-ations between economic dynamics and lending. By contrast, it can be seen that loan developments in Spain and, depending 
on the estimation period, possibly in Italy, 
too, are weaker than would have been ex-
pected based on the historical correlations 
between lending and output and price de-
velopments.12 An explicit analysis of the 
causes of these deviations is not possible 
within the framework of the empirical ap-
proach applied here.13
12 The model can be extended to include additional, 
potential determinants to enable an even better ex-
planation of loan developments. For example, model 
variants were estimated that include the difference 
 between corporate bond yields / bank bonds and yields 
on German Bunds calculated by Mojon and Gilchrist. 
See B Mojon and S Gilchrist (2014), Credit risk in the 
euro area, NBER Working Paper Series No 20041, Na-
tional Bureau of Economic Research. However, these 
data are only available from 1999 onward. Simulations 
using this model for the period from the third quarter 
of 2008 onward produce narrower deviations com-
pared with the chart on p 24, particularly for Italy, but also for Spain.
13 This would require the identifi  cation of the struc-
tural shocks, but, given the size of the model, that presents the problem of deriving suitable identifying 
restrictions.

money and credit growth in the euro area and in individual

pean System of Accounts (ESA) 2010.

eraging, was the substantial write-  downs when bank loans 
were transferred to Spain’s SAREB resolution agency. This 
topic is discussed in greater detail in Banco de España, An

which are factored into the debt ratio, with 
other financing instruments. They did this in 
two ways. First, they stepped up their equity 
issuance, a move which also helped to signifi -
cantly redress the pre-  crisis dr op in the equity 
ratio. Second, they increased their internal fi -
nancing, notwithstanding the cyclical decline in 
gross value added, primarily because employee 
compensation fell sharply on the back of em -
ployment adjustments.
To gauge whether the adjustments involved in 
the deleveraging process are still having a 
dampening effect on loan demand, it is neces-
sary to quantify the debt overhang. This is fre-
quently done by comparing the actual debt 
ratio with a hypothetical equilibrium level, the 
difference being interpreted as the debt over -
hang or underhang. However, estimating the 
equilibrium level is fraught with major difficul -
ties,14 which is why it makes sense to measure 
the debt overhangs using various reference val -
ues; in this case, the results calculated using different methods should only be viewed in 
their totality and interpreted as rough approxi-
mations.
The table on page 29 presents the debt over -
hangs for the four largest euro-  ar ea countries, 
as quantified using three different reference 
values. The first of these reference values is the 
euro-  ar ea debt ratio, which is used to approxi -
mate a cross-  country metric.15 Such a cross-  
country benchmark analysis is relatively straightforward and transparent, given that it 
focuses on a given point in time. But in light of 
the excesses experienced in Spain and other member states, this metric is prone to under -

cause, over time, national developments of 
that kind also feed into the benchmark. If the 
excesses have not been sufficiently reduced at 
the time of the comparison, the benchmark 
will have an upward bias.
A somewhat stricter reference value for 
gauging a possible debt overhang is the histor -
ical average of a given country’s debt ratio. 
However, the results thus calculated are heavily 
dependent on the sample period chosen. 
Owing to data availability constraints, the 
period from the first quarter of 1999 until the 
first quarter of 2015 was selected for the above 
table.16 The sample period thus covers a pro -
tracted phase of excessive credit expansion, 
notably for Spain, but not the complete correc-
tion of these excesses. That is why, rather like 
the first reference value, this approach risks 
understating a possible debt overhang.
The analysis is augmented by a reference value 
derived from a paper authored by Cecchetti et 
al (2011).17 Based on a panel of 18 OECD coun -
tries between 1980 and 2010, the authors con -
clude that a debt ratio of 90% or more for 
non- financial corpor ations impacts negatively 
on economic growth. Being a fixed reference 
ratio that is largely unaffected by country-  
specific factors, it significantly reduces the risk of understating the debt overhang in individual countries.
It may be cautiously inferred that, while all 
three indicators in the above table continue to 
point to the existence of a debt overhang in 
Spain, it is considerably smaller than it was at 
the beginning of 2010, and it is now relatively 
low in absolute terms, too. The upturn in GDP 
over the last few quarters has further sup -
ported the deleveraging process. Bearing this in 
mind, the need for adjustment in the non-  
financial corporate sector resulting from the 
debt overhang should now be exerting much 
less pressure overall on bank lending in Spain.
On the whole, indebtedness is a less critical 
topic for non-  financial corpor ations in Italy. The 
debt-  t o-  G DP ratio was below the euro-  a rea 
average both before and after the onset of the 
financial crisis, and the reference value defined 
by Cecchetti et al was not exceeded. However, the debt ratio increased steadily until 2009 and

cating that indebtedness is slightly above the 
historical average at the current juncture. But 
by and large, debt levels in Italy per se should 
not have significantly dampened firms’ demand 
for loans.
While comparisons of this kind indicate that 
debt levels at German non-  financial corpor -
ations have been rather unremarkable and rela -
tively stable over time, for French enterprises 
they reveal that debt levels have climbed per -
sistently over many years, even though GDP 
has followed a positive growth path overall 
since 2010. This trend was driven primarily by 
an increase in debt securities, whereas the ratio 
of loans to GDP has remained static since 2009. 
Yet two factors have a stabilising effect on debt 
levels in the French non-  financial corporate 
sector – first, firms still have an ample equity 
level relative to other euro-  ar ea countries; 
second, a large proportion of the debt of 
French non-  financial corpor ations is in the form 
of intra-  sector al loans. Factoring them out of the debt ratio reduces the debt overhang 
 figures calculated above quite substantially.18
Importance of supply-  side 
factors
Besides the demand-  side determinants dis -
cussed so far, the sluggish loan growth in Italy 
and Spain is also partly a consequence of the 
strains which the financial and sovereign debt 
crisis caused in those countries’ banking sys -
tems. The tightening sovereign-  bank nexus in  
both Italy and Spain since the onset of the 
 financial crisis considerably raised banks’ fund -
ing costs at the peak of the sovereign debt cri -
sis to an even higher level than that seen dur -
ing the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 (see 
the adjacent chart).19 By comparison, German 
institutions faced barely any strains and French 
institutions only moderate pressure.
The Eurosystem implemented a series of non-  
standard measures in the midst of the sover -
eign debt crisis to support bank lending and 
counter the severe tensions in the financial 
markets. Its measures notably included imple -
menting two three-  year tenders in late 2 011/
early 2012 and announcing that under certain 
conditions, it stood ready to activate a pur -
chase programme for sovereign debt securities 
(outright monetary transactions: OMT). Since 
the end of 2012, these measures have contrib -
uted to a steady improvement in general bank 
funding conditions in the periphery countries; 
however, CDS spreads for banks domiciled 
there remained at elevated levels into early 
2014.French firms’

Compounding the situation, the cyclical slump 
markedly deteriorated20 credit quality in Italy 
and Spain, particularly among small and 
medium-  s ized firms, driving up the banks’ 
 exposures to non-  performing loans.21 Since 
 impairments of loans and advances affect earn -
ings, the rise in non-  performing loans fed  
straight through to banks’ P&L and hindered 
their efforts to build up capital internally. Profit-
ability in Spain’s banking sector has been im -
proving appreciably since legacy loan portfolios 
were transferred to a resolution agency at the 
turn of 2012-13 and the pronounced pick-  up in 
the country’s economy; the level of impaired 
loans remains high, however, though it has 
been easing somewhat of late. Italy is planning 
to establish an asset management company 
specialising in the purchase of non-  performing 
loans.22
Development of credit 
 standards
This raises the question of to what extent the 
strains on the banking systems, particularly 
those that emerged at the peak of the sover -
eign debt crisis, are continuing to affect cor-
porate lending developments and whether any 
supply-  side factors are still curtailing the supply 
of bank loans today. Banks can respond to the 
funding and capital problems they face both by 
tightening their credit standards – which can 
potentially constrain lending volumes – or by 
imperfectly passing through the reductions in 
Eurosystem policy rates.
An important source of information on supply-  
side constraints to bank lending is the Bank 
Lending Survey (BLS), a quarterly survey in 
which the Eurosystem asks selected banks to 
report on changes in their credit standards 
when granting new corporate loans. Primarily 
Italian banks, but also Spanish and French insti -
tutions, reported that the sovereign debt crisis 
had prompted them to tighten their credit 
standards in 2011-12, in some cases consider -
ably, whereas in Germany credit standards re -mained basically unchanged. Since the fourth quarter of 2013, however, credit standards 
have not been noticeably tightened in any of 
the three countries. In fact, Italian and French 
banks have loosened their credit standards 
again somewhat over the past three quarters. 
However, there are substantial differences in 
the level23 of credit standards: Italian banks re -
ported that the current level of their credit standards is still considerably tighter than the 
reference level prevailing after the second quar -
ter of 2010,24 while Spanish banks said that 
their level is still moderately tighter. In France, 
the respondent banks stated that their credit standards were currently considerably looser 
than the relevant reference level.
Besides the banks’ responses about their credit 
standards, the factors they report as having 
prompted them to adjust their lending policy 
provide additional useful information. These 
 responses indicate that supply-  side constr aints 
were one of the reasons why they tightened 
their credit standards during the sovereign debt 
crisis. Those constraints included funding con -
ditions in the money and bond market plus, in 
Italy and France, banks’ liquidity position and 
the cost of capital. However, from mid-2012,

23 The reference level is the midpoint of the range of 
credit standards between the maximum and the minimum level of credit standards during this time period. The word -
ing of the question, which asks each bank to compare the 
current level of its credit standards with its individual past 
reference level, prevents any cross-  country comparison of  
the current level of credit standards. See Deutsche Bundes -
bank, The level of credit standards in the Bank Lending Sur -
vey, Monthly Report, August 2014, pp 44-47.
24 This assessment is broadly consistent with the cumu -
lated changes in credit standards since 2010 in Italy, where 
they continued to be tightened considerably after the 
onset of the sovereign debt crisis in the second quarter of 2010, whereas this was barely the case in the other coun -
tries.Deutsche Bundesbank

mainly cited cyclical and demand-  side factors  
as the reason for tightening their credit stand -
ards. The loosening of credit standards for 
loans to enterprises in Italy that has been ob -
served for the past three quarters is primarily 
being fuelled by improved conditions for bank 
funding. Banks particularly pointed to their 
 robust liquidity position – which has probably 
been substantially bolstered by the accommo -
dative monetary policy measures adopted since 
mid-2014 – and the reduced cost of capital as 
the reasons why they eased their credit stand -
ards.
Lending rates and   
pass-  through
Econometric analyses, moreover, suggest that 
Italian and Spanish banks changed the manner 
in which they passed through interest rates 
during the financial and sovereign debt crisis 
(see the box on pages  33 to 35). Although funding costs for euro-  ar ea banks were pushed 
down in 2012 by contracting government bond 
yields as well as the policy rate cuts and non-  
standard monetary policy measures imple -
mented by the Eurosystem, lending rates for 
new corporate loans in Italy and Spain initially 
persisted at a relatively high level, while the corresponding rates in Germany and France 
began to decline significantly from the end of 
2011 (see the adjacent chart). Lending rates for business loans in Italy and Spain did not begin to clearly diminish until the spring of 2014.
The results of interest rate pass-  thr ough esti -
mations (see the box on pages 33 to 35) indi -
cate that bank lending rates in Italy and Spain 
persisted at a relatively high level in 2012 and 
2013 because the monetary policy stimulus, 
which per se tended to facilitate lower interest 
rates, was increasingly cancelled out by grow -
ing bank mark-  ups on the base rate of interest 
for business loans. This was how banks re -
sponded to their earnings problems and pre -
vented their interest margins (net interest in -
come as a percentage of total assets) from 
plummeting. Indeed, interest margins in the 
overall interest-  bearing business of Italian and  
Spanish banks contracted only slightly between 2010 and 2014.
25
Interest rate pass-  thr ough behaviour has been 
returning to normal since the beginning of 
2014. The mark-  ups which banks added to  
their base rate of interest in response to the 
crisis are decreasing, and lending rates in per -
iphery countries are converging towards core 
country rates again. A decomposition of lend -
ing rates reveals that the lingering differences

25 The low-  inter est-  r ate environment has barely affected 
the interest expenditure of banks in Italy and Spain, which has remained largely static since 2006. If interest rates on 
business loans in these two countries had shrunk to the 
same extent as they did in Germany and France, say, their 
banking systems would have run into very real earnings problems. Those problems did not arise in Germany be -
cause although German banks’ net interest income was 
relatively low, the low level of credit risk kept loan-  loss pr o-
visioning costs down, thus bolstering their net earnings.Deutsche Bundesbank

The interest rate pass-through in the crisis
One possible cause of the weak develop-
ment of loans to non- fi  nancial corporations 
in the EU periphery countries lies in the rela-tively high lending rates there compared to the core countries. As the chart on page 32 
shows, the spread between interest rates for new loans to enterprises in Italy and 
Spain and the corresponding German inter-
est rates increased sh arply from 2011 and has only narrowed again since 2014. The following analysis therefore examines whether the pass- through from market rates to bank lending rates has changed 
during the fi  nancial and sovereign debt cri-sis in the euro area, with a special focus on Italy and Spain.
When carrying out analyses of this kind, error correction models such as the one 
below are typically used, whereby the short- 
term1 interest rate for new bank loans to 
enterprises brt depends on a reference 
interest rate2 mrt and a measure of risk 
spreadt3.
(1)
Error correction models such as (1) are com-
posed of two parts. One part captures short- term dynamics, while the other de-scribes the long- term equilibrium relation-
ship which the system generally strives to-
wards. The variables of the equilibrium rela-tionship must be cointegrated over the en-
tire observation period, which for reasons of data availability cannot begin before 
2003.4 This data characteristic can be veri-
fi  ed by means of various test procedures.5 
For the countries concerned and for the euro area as a whole, all the procedures used here show that, over the entire period 
2003 to 2015, an equilibrium relationship 
between the reference interest rate and the short- term bank lending rate can only then be  assumed if the government bond spread is explicitly taken into account. This is a fun-damental difference to the pre- crisis period, 
when this variable scarcely played any role 
at all in the interest rate pass- through.6 This 
refl  ects the increased interconnectedness between the government sector and the banking sector. Since 2010, this intercon-nectedness has been shown in the almost perfect correlation between the credit 
1 Encompasses loan agreements with both variable 
interest rates and initial rate fi  xations of up to one year. 
Such interest fi  xations dominate in the case of new 
and existing loans in Italy and Spain, but also in the 
euro area.2 The reference interest rate is not intended as a proxy for banks’ fi  nancing costs, but represents the basic rate 
of interest (“risk- free” interest rate) in the calculation 
of the lending rate. Banks normally use benchmark 
money market rates (EONIA, three- month EURIBOR or the 1-month overnight index swap) to calculate inter-est rates for short- term loans.
3 Risk premium on 10-year government bonds com-
pared to the long-term risk-free interest rate in the 
euro area (10-year EURIBOR interest rate swap). It is an 
approximation of the respective country’s credit de-
fault risk.
4 This is true when, as in this case, the variables are 
non- stationary. Cointegration generally exists if non- 
stationary time series have a linear relationship with a stationary error term.
5 Usually, the Johansen test, the Engle- Granger test 
and the Gregory- Hansen test are used for this purpose. 
The Gregory- Hansen test takes into account possible structural breaks (level shifts as well as structural 
breaks) in the long- term relationship. See S Johansen,

metrica, 59, 1991, pp 1551-1580, R F Engle and C W J

 default risks of both sectors.7 Accordingly, 
over the course of the crisis, the risk pre-
mium on government bonds has become a 
relevant determinant for the interest rate 
pass- through.
Moreover, it is conceivable that parameters 
of the model (1) may have also changed as a result of the crisis. Of special interest here 
are the constant α of the equilibrium rela-
tionship and the parameter γ. The latter 
 describes the speed of adjustment to the 
long- term equilibrium and must lie between -1 and 0. A value close to 0 would imply a 
slow adjustment and thus a sluggish dis-
mantling of imbalances. The constant α in 
the equilibrium term, which refl  ects those infl  uences that were not explicitly taken 
into account in the equilibrium relationship, 
may likewise have changed as a result of 
the crisis.8These possibilities are tested by writing the 
error correction model in a time- variant 
manner in the form of a state space model.

Equations (2) and (4) represent the observa-
tion equation of the respective state space 
model. A simultaneous determination of 
the time- varying coeffi   cients is not possible 
because the observation equation is re-
quired to be linear in the state variables. For 
this reason, both variants are estimated 
separately; however, the results of both models must be interpreted together. The hypothesis of time variability in the coeffi   -cients 
γt and αt is modelled in the corres-
ponding state equations (3) and (5), with the respective time variable parameter being specifi  ed as a random walk. The 
models are estimated on the basis of max-
imum likelihood, and smoothed values are 
determined for the time- varying coeffi   cients 
γt and αt using the Kalman fi  lter and 
smoother.
The chart on page 34 shows the smoothed 
estimates for the time- varying parameters 
γt (adjustment coeffi   cient) and αt (constant) 
in their respective confi  dence band. The 
broad confi  dence bands of the adjustment 
coeffi   cient and, therefore, the implicitly 
higher uncertainty in determining this co-effi   cient indicate that the constant is pre-
sumably the main driving time- varying fac-
tor. The pattern of the constants in Italy, 
Spain and the euro area is nearly identical, 
both for the continuous rise starting at the outset of the fi  nancial crisis in 2007 and the 
decline of the constants from the start of 
2014.9
A core element in interpreting the constant is that it is closely correlated with the inter-
est income from the lending business. It is 
therefore noteworthy that banks’ interest 
margin declined only slightly between 2011 
and 2013, despite high interest expend-iture.
10 This suggests that the increased 
mark- up in lending business served to pre-
vent a slump in the interest margin.
Overall, it can therefore be said that the 
interest setting behaviour in Spain and Italy, 
but also in the euro area as a whole, has changed over the course of the fi  nancial 
and sovereign debt crisis compared to the 
pre- crisis period. For one thing, risk in the form of the government bond spread has 
gained in importance, leading to a widen-
ing of the interest rate gap between lend-
ing rates and reference rates. For another, a 
continuously rising mark- up can be ob-served in banks’ interest setting behaviour from the beginning of the crisis in 2007 
that has only latterly declined again slightly. 
9 As a robustness analysis, the bank bond spread was 
also integrated into the analysis, both individually and together with the government bond spread. However, this does not change either the results for the cointe-gration test or the results of the time- varying constants 
for Spain, Italy and the euro area. This indicates that 
the government bond spread since 2010 can be used as a broad measure of risk for the banking sector, too.

The inﬂ  uence of credit supply shocks on the development 
of real GDP and lending to euro-area non-fi  nancial  corporations
A further option for analysing the causes of 
weak growth in lending to fi  rms is to de-
compose the lending growth rate into con-
tributions from selected macroeconomic 
shocks using a vector autoregressive (VAR) 
model that describes the dynamic inter-
action between lending growth and other 
important macroeconomic variables.
The model used here comprises eight vari-ables for the euro area, namely the annual 
growth rates of real gross domestic product 
(GDP), of the GDP defl  ator, of real MFI loans 
to non- fi  nancial corporations, of the real money supply M3 and of a defl  ated share 
price index (DJ Eurostoxx)1 as well as the aver-
age yields on ten- year government bonds, an 
average interest rate for bank loans to non- 
fi  nancial corporations and a shadow short 
rate, which serves as an indicator of the mon-
etary policy stance.2 The model is estimated 
over the period from the fi  rst quarter of 1993 to the second quarter of 2015 using Bayesian 
methods.3 Sign restrictions are used to iden-
tify economic shocks.4 The model identifi  es 
an aggregate supply shock  (infl  ation shock), 
an aggregate demand shock, a monetary 
policy shock and a credit supply shock.5 They 
are identifi  ed using contemporaneous sign restrictions, in other words by assumptions 
concerning the direction of the simultaneous 
reactions of the other variables to the shock 
in question. In the following, a credit supply 
shock denotes all shocks that cause lending 
growth to fall, lending rates to rise, GDP growth to fall and monetary policy to be-come more expansionary. Defi  ned in this 
1 Loans, money supply and share prices are defl  ated 
using the GDP defl  ator.
2 The shadow short rate (SSR) is an indicator that is de-
rived from the yield curve. In “normal” times it corres-
ponds to the monetary policy rate. If this is at the zero lower bound or if non- standard monetary policy meas-
ures are implemented, the SSR can deviate from the 
monetary policy rate and also assume negative values. See L Krippner (2013), Measuring the stance of monet-ary policy in zero lower bound environments, Econom-ics Letters, 118, pp 135-138. For the SSR used here, see http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research_and_publications/ research_programme/additional_research/comparison- 
of- international- monetary- policy- measures.html (ac-cessed on 11 September 2015). Inclusion of the SSR 
enables the model to approximately capture the impact 
of non- standard monetary policy measures on the monetary policy stance without explicitly modelling 
them. For the period prior to 1995, the SSR is replaced by a German interbank interest rate for overnight credit.
3 The lag order is fi  ve. The estimation methodology 
follows D Giannone, M Lenza and G Primiceri (2015), 
Prior selection for vector autoregressions, Review of Economics and Statistics, 97, pp 436-451. The prior 
distribution for the VAR coeffi   cients and the diagonal 
elements of the covariance matrix is based on the esti-
mation of an AR(1) model for each variable over the 
entire estimation period. The model assumes constant 
relations between the variables and in the covariance 
matrix of the shock processes over the entire period.4 See J Arias, J Rubio- Ramírez and D Waggoner (2014), Inference based on SVARs identifi  ed with sign and zero 
restrictions: theory and applications, Dynare Working 
Paper Series, No 30.5 For a discussion of the possibility of identifying credit 
supply shocks using structural VAR models, see 
H Mumtaz, G Pinter and K Theodoridis (2015), What 
do VARs tell us about the impact of a credit supply 
shock?, Working Paper No 739, School of Economics 
and Finance, Queen Mary University. The sign restric-
tions used largely correspond to those in M Bijster-
bosch and M Falagardia (2014), Credit supply dynam-
ics and economic activity in euro area countries: a 
time- varying parameter VAR analysis, European Central 
Bank, Working Paper Series No 1714. The aggregate 
supply shock pushes up real GDP growth and pushes 
down the infl  ation rate and the monetary policy rate; the aggregate demand shock pushes up GDP growth, 
the infl  ation rate, the lending rate and the monetary 
policy rate. A monetary policy shock implies a rise in 
the monetary policy rate and a fall in GDP growth and the infl  ation rate. The restrictions apply to the contem-
poraneous response of the variables to the shock in 
question and are consistent with the results of various 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models (DSGE 
models) that contain a banking sector; for instance A Gerali, S Neri, L Sessa and F M Signoretti (2010), 
Credit and banking in a DSGE model of the euro area, 
Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 42, pp 107-
141; M Gertler and P Karadi (2011), A model of uncon-
ventional monetary policy, Journal of Monetary Eco-
nomics, 58, pp 17-34. In a departure from Bijsterbosch 
and Falagardia (2014), op cit, the restrictions do not 
comprise a negative response of the infl  ation rate to a 
contractionary credit supply shock as this does not 
generally follow from the theoretical analyses; see, for 
instance, the short- run positive response of the infl  a-
tion rate to a bank capital shock in Gerali et al (2010), op cit. Separation of the aggregate supply shock from 
the credit supply shock is achieved by assuming a negative reaction of the monetary policy rate to the 
aggregate supply shock. This modifi  cation has little im-pact on the results presented here.Deutsche Bundesbank

way, the credit supply shock represents a 
range of underlying disruptions that can all infl  uence the banking sector’s loan supply  behaviour. This could involve, for instance, exogenous changes in banks’ capital or net 
worth, capital quality, loan- to- value limits or 
interest- setting behaviour.6 An historical de-
composition for the variables contained in 
the model is derived from the model estima-tion and the shock identifi  cation. This decom-poses the deviations of each variable from its unconditional mean into the contributions of present and past realisations of the identifi  ed shocks. The adjacent chart shows this histor-
ical decomposition for the annual growth rates of real GDP and real lending to non- 
fi  nancial corporations.
The analysis shows that credit supply shocks 
had relevant effects on lending growth 
both in the post-2005 boom and during the 
sovereign debt crisis. During the latter, 
negative credit supply shocks made a no-
ticeable contribution to the decline in lend-ing growth, although their negative contri-
bution has been receding for some time 
now.7 The stabilisation from mid-2013 and 
the subsequent recovery of lending growth 
was additionally bolstered by the negative 
effects of real economic shocks fading out. 
Real GDP growth, too, was weakened by 
negative credit supply shocks between mid-
2008 and the end of 2009, and then again in 2012 and 2013. In the recent past, how-
ever, these shocks had no negative impact 
on real economic growth.8 When taking 
into account the estimation uncertainty, the monetary policy shock proves by and large to be quantitatively irrelevant for the devel-opment of both output and lending.
9
These results prove to be qualitatively ro-bust to a number of model modifi  cations. In addition, some explorative estimations 
using similar models have been conducted 
at the country level. These indicate that 
credit supply shocks in Italy and, to a lesser extent, in France in the wake of the sover-eign debt crisis had a negative infl  uence on 6 See Gerali et al (2010), op cit, or Gertler and Karadi 
(2011), op cit.7 The contributions of the individual shocks shown in the chart represent the median of the posterior distri-bution of the shock effects from the Bayesian estima-
tion of the model. The estimation uncertainty shown 
by this distribution is relatively high, meaning that only 
the contributions in the chart that are rather pro-nounced compared to the estimation uncertainty 
should be interpreted as being relevant.
8 The analysis of the impulse response functions 
shows that the negative response of lending growth to 
a credit supply shock is more persistent than in the case of GDP growth. In other words, the impact of past credit supply shocks on lending growth lasts 
longer than that on GDP growth.
9 Thus the posterior distribution of the contributions 
of the monetary policy shock shows a noticeable 
negative effect on GDP growth only for a short time 
and only at the start of the fi  nancial market crisis. For the remaining period and for the lending growth rate, 
the distribution shows neither a noticeable negative 
nor a noticeable positive impact.Historical decomposition of the effects of economic shockson the annual growth rates of real GDP and real lending to euro-area non-financial corporations

other are probably chiefly attributable to bor -
rower credit risk.
All in all, banks’ credit standards and their lend -
ing rates for non-  financial corpor ations would 
therefore appear to suggest that supply-  side  
constraints on bank lending indeed played a 
role in Italy and Spain,26 but that their influence 
has dwindled considerably in the meantime. 
This assessment applies in equal measure to 
the euro area as a whole (see the box on 
pages 36 to 38).
Conclusion
Lending to non-  financial corpor ations is now 
by and large showing clear signs of recovery in 
all of the four largest euro-  ar ea countries. This 
is due both to the economic recovery and to 
the waning influence of various demand-  side  
and supply-  side factors r elated to the crisis 
which had depressed lending levels.For example, the corporate sector’s debt over -
hang in Spain has been materially lowered 
since 2012, a process which is now being add -
itionally boosted by the robust economic up -
swing. Moreover, for Spain and Italy, the avail -
able indicators and models used to identify 
supply-  side constr aints suggest on balance that 
the negative supply-  side factors hindering bank 
lending have receded distinctly.
While the current situation may generally be 
considered positive, it is equally important to 
assess whether there are any lingering risks 
going forward – not least in the light of the 
ongoing negative annualised growth rates for 
loans to non-  financial corpor ations in Italy and 
Spain. One particular risk factor in these two 
countries is the high level of non-  performing  Econometric

e risksthe development of corporate lending, 
whereby these infl  uences have recently been declining. For Germany the analysis 
revealed no discernible role for credit supply 
shocks during the sovereign debt crisis. With regard to the development of real GDP growth, the analyses indicate that 
credit supply shocks in Italy during the sov-
ereign debt crisis may have contributed to 
the weak development of real GDP , whereas 
this was not the case in Germany and France. According to these estimations, 
however, credit supply shocks are currently no longer having a negative impact on the development of real GDP in Italy, either.
For Spain, the analysis shows clear negative 
effects of credit supply shocks on both the 
development of lending to non- fi  nancial corporations and on real GDP growth; in some model specifi  cations, these effects 
persist up to the current time. But it should 
be noted that in the case of Spain there is 
the general problem that, relative to the other countries, the results are subject to very high estimation uncertainty and are 
sensitive to the estimation period.
However, the fi  nding that credit supply shocks have made a noticeable contribu-
tion to explaining the weak lending growth 
in the euro area during the fi  nancial and sovereign debt crisis should not be inter-preted as meaning that developments on 
the loan demand side were irrelevant. The 
shock decomposition identifi  es, viewed through the fi  lter of the empirical model, the causes of fl  uctuations in the variables 
around their unconditional mean. However 
it does not identify via which transmission 
channels the various shocks affected these 
variables. For instance, aggregate supply 
shocks, aggregate demand shocks, monet-
ary policy shocks or disruptions contained 
in the shocks that are not explicitly identi-
fi  ed may have resulted in the negative ef-
fect shown in the chart on page 37 via the channel of lower loan demand.

loans, which is continuing to squeeze banks’ 
profitability in periphery countries and thus 
 impinge on their balance sheets. The measures 
needed to reduce this vulnerability include thoroughly cleansing balance sheets of both 
existing and anticipated losses as well as imple -
menting regulations aimed at preventing fresh 
vulnerabilities from emerging in future, includ-
ing requiring banks to back their sovereign ex -
posures with capital. The task of eliminating these risks is thus a matter which the banks 
themselves, and banking supervisors and fiscal 
policymakers, too, will need to address. In Italy, 
the state-  backed asset management company  
that is currently being set up should be able to 
play a key role in reducing the volume of non-  
performing loans in future.27

The performance of German credit 
 institutions in 2014
The operating income of German banks again saw robust growth despite the persistence of the 
low- inter est-  r ate environment in 2014, the favourable refinancing conditions and the real eco -
nomic environment having a positive effect in this respect. By contrast, costs were pushed up by 
the preparatory work in launching the European banking union and implementing new reporting 
requirements. In anticipation of its role as the future direct supervisory authority for euro-  ar ea 
institutions classified as systemically important, the European Central Bank carried out an exten -
sive asset quality review of those banks’ balance sheets as well as a stress test. Overall, the 
 German significant institutions were found to meet the regulatory capital adequacy requirements.
On the whole, operating income rose moderately to €121.5 billion against the backdrop of a 
declining balance sheet total. Net interest income in particular – the most important component of operating income – saw significant growth. Greater maturity transformation, a marked increase in lending and a pronounced drop in funding costs played a major part in this. However, future 
scope for stabilising margins will probably become increasingly limited given the now very low 
level of interest expenditure. The fact that deposit rates are close to the zero lower bound leaves 
very little room for further interest rate cuts, not least, from a business and competition policy 
perspective.
In particular, the persistently low costs of banks’ credit risk provisioning have proven to be a 
mainstay of profitability. Annual profit rose substantially to €24.2 billion. The equity capital base 
was strengthened, too, driving the pre-  tax r eturn on equity up to 5.7%. A net profit (€1.8 billion) 
was recorded for the first time since 2007, mainly due to individual banks releasing reserves to 
compensate for substantial losses brought forward.Deutsche Bundesbank

Banks’ business environment
The German economy was in good shape in the 
reporting year. Following a promising start to 
the year, economic activity initially lost some of 
its momentum, but again gathered pace signifi-
cantly towards the end of 2014. The reduction 
in costs due to the drop in oil prices is likely to have made a positive contribution. Once again, 
an especially strong stimulus was provided by domestic economic activity. Private consump -
tion benefited from the marked rise in labour 
income paired with muted inflation. Moreover, 
the depreciation of the euro played a consider -
able part in German enterprises being able to 
expand their non-  eur o-  ar ea export markets.
For German banks, 2014 was very much char -
acterised by the preparations for the launch of 
the European banking union. In response to 
the financial crisis that erupted in 2008, the 
European Council decided in 2012 to create 
uniform cross-  bor der supervisory standards. 
The core elements of this banking union are the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and 
the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). When 
the SSM entered into force on 4  November 
2014, extensive prudential supervisory powers 
and responsibility for directly supervising the 
123 euro-  ar ea credit institutions currently clas -
sified as significant was transferred to the Euro -
pean Central Bank (ECB). Before assuming its 
new supervisory tasks, between October 2013 
and October 2014 the ECB carried out a com -
prehensive assessment (CA) comprising a qual -
ity review of the assets on banks’ balance sheets and a stress test. The CA showed that 
the German significant banks met the regula -
tory capital adequacy requirements. With re -
gard to the reporting sample of the German 
credit institutions covered by the profit and loss 
statistics of German banks1 – a total of 1,695 
institutions in 2014 – their balance sheet cap -
ital2 had been strengthened substantially by al -
most one-  thir d to €428 billion since the crisis 
year of 2008. Accordingly, the balance sheet 
equity ratio3 in 2014 was, at 5.2%, markedly 
higher than the long-  term average.4Essentially as a result of merger activity in the 
cooperative bank sector, the reporting group 
covered by the statistics of the banks’ profit and loss accounts was reduced by 31 banks compared to 2013, and by as many as 208 
 institutions compared to 2007, the last year 
 before the crisis.
Growth in net interest 
 income
Net interest income (also referred to as net interest received) is traditionally the most im -
portant source of income for German credit in -
stitutions. Amounting to €90.4 billion in the 
reporting year, it was €4.1 billion higher on the year, and its 74.4% share in operating income
5 
was just above the long-  term aver age. The 
main contribution stems from income from 
traditional deposit and lending business,6 ie net 
interest income in the narrower sense, which 
went up considerably by 5.8% on the year to 
€76.2 billion, accounting for 62.7% of operat-ing income. This growth was largely fuelled by 
the favourable financing conditions coupled 
with an increase in lending volume, which 
benefited the networked institutions in particu -
lar, and, last but not least, by the fact that a 
negative accounting-  r elated special item at 
special-  purpose banks ceased to apply .7 Be-

Methodological notes
Data based on individual accounts 
in accordance with the German  Commercial Code and on monthly  balance sheet statistics
The results from the profi  t and loss ac-counts are based on the published annual reports of the individual institutions in 
accordance  with the provisions set forth in 
the German Commercial Code (Handels-
gesetzbuch or HGB) and the Regulation on 
the Accounting of Credit Institutions (Ver-ordnung über die Rechnungslegung der 
Kreditinstitute or RechKredV). They differ in 
terms of their conception, structure and 
defi  nitions from the internationally custom-
ary IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) accounting standards
1 for cap-
ital market-oriented banking groups, which 
means that, from a me thodological view-point, the respective business results and certain balance sheet or individual profi  t 
and loss items are not comparable between 
the national and international accounting framework. For reasons of comparability 
within Germany, it is advisable to consider 
the individual accounts when analysing the 
performance. Using group accounts would 
make a meaningful analysis diffi   cult as, fi  rst, 
many German banks are not part of a group, meaning that their individual ac-counts drawn up in accordance with the 
German Commercial Code would still have 
to be used; second, not all group accounts 
are prepared according to international  accounting standards. The values for the capital as shown in the balance sheet 
(equity), the balance sheet total and other 
stock fi  gures are not obtained from the 
 annual reports but are calculated as annual average values on the basis of the monthly balance sheet statistics reported for the in-stitution as a whole.Reporting group
The reporting group for statistics on banks’ 
profi  t and loss accounts (profi  t and loss 
statistics) includes all banks that are monet-
ary fi  nancial institutions and in addition are 
domiciled in Germany. Building and loan  associations, branches of foreign banks that are exempted from the provisions of 
section 53 of the German Banking Act (Kre-
ditwesengesetz or KWG), banks in liquid-
ation and banks with a fi  nancial year under twelve months (truncated fi  nancial year) are not included in this performance analysis.
Calculation of the long- term average
When the new accounting legislation for 
credit institutions entered into effect in 1993, a number of terms were redefi  ned, 
which makes it diffi   cult to compare income- related data from 1993 onwards with earl-ier data. Furthermore, additional time series 
were introduced. Except where another 
time period is explicitly mentioned, the cal-
culations with regard to the longer- term 
average refer to annual data for the obser-vation period 1993 to 2014.
1 IFRS- based accounts are of relevance, for instance, 
to matters of macroprudential analysis and oversight, 
concentrating on systemically important banks and 
their international business activities (including their 
foreign subsidiaries). For details, see Deutsche Bundes-bank, Financial Stability Review 2013, November 2013.Deutsche Bundesbank

interest received are current income from 
shares and other variable-  yield securities, par -
ticipating interests, shares in affiliated enter -
prises and income from profit transfers.8 These 
totalled €14.2 billion, accounting for 11.7% of 
operating income in the reporting year. As 
usual, large banks operating globally in a com-
plex group structure accounted for more than 
half (€7.6 billion) of that total. Networked insti-
tutions, whose investments in specialised 
funds9 mainly generate current income from 
shares and other variable-  yield securities, con -
tributed a further €3.9 billion.
The persistently weak inflation outlook and the 
continuing muted demand for credit on the 
part of the non-  financial private sector in the  
euro area prompted the ECB Governing Coun -
cil to implement various and, in some cases, 
non- conventional monetary policy measur es to 
stimulate economic activity. The interest rate 
on the main refinancing operations and the de-
posit rate were each lowered by 10 basis points in both June and September. In June 2014, this 
caused the deposit facility rate to slip into 
negative territory for the first time in the ECB’s history: it has stood at -0.2% since September 2014. Moreover, the supply of liquidity received a further boost by the end of the year from the 
amounts allotted through the first two of eight 
targeted longer-  t erm refinancing operations 
with the Eurosystem10 and through the pur -
chase programmes for asset-  backed securities  
and covered bonds launched in October 2014. 
Amidst the ample supply of liquidity, interest 
rates in the interbank market fell to new all-  
time lows. On a monthly average, the interest 
rate on unsecured money market transactions 
between banks (Euro InterBank Offered Rate, 
EURIBOR) with a three-  month maturity was a  
mere 0.08% in December 2014. The unsecured 
interbank overnight rate (Euro OverNight Index 
Average, EONIA) was even slightly negative. 
Yields on covered and uncovered bank bonds,11 
too, followed a steady downward trajectory 
and in December 2014 stood at only 0.4% and 
0.7% respectively. The very low yields on 
shorter-  term bank bonds in particular ar e likely 
to have led to a sharp drop in demand on the 
part of institutional investors. The percentage 
share of these bonds with residual maturities of 
between one year and up to five years in total 
bond refinancing fell to 17%, a new historical 
low. Moreover, the ongoing balance sheet re -

tions belonging to the reporting group covered by the stat -

ket- oriented Landesbanken and mortgage  
banks contributed to a renewed year-  on-  year  
decline in issuance volume.
Overall, the slope of the German yield curve 
– as measured by the yield differential between 
ten- year and two-year F ederal bonds – became 
flatter during the course of the year, falling by 
117 basis points to only 70 basis points. The 
low key interest rates shaped, above all, the 
downward movement of the short-  t erm and 
even the medium-  term maturity segment: in  
the second half of the year, the negative yields 
gradually affected residual maturities up to 4.5 
years. In the long-  term maturity segment, safe 
haven effects in the wake of geopolitical crises and additionally, in the fourth quarter, the pro -
spect of an expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (EAPP) by the Eurosystem are likely to 
have played a part in the marked decline in 
yields.The shift from fixed-  term deposits to overnight 
deposits, induced by the non-  fin ancial private 
sector’s unceasing aversion to risk and its per -
sistently strong preference for liquidity, has 
been shaping the liabilities side of banks’ bal -
ance sheets for years and, in the reporting year, 
too, eased banks’ funding costs as deposit 
rates continued to fall. Since the crisis year of 
2008, liabilities to non-  banks (excluding sav -

In principle, this growing concentration on 
overnight deposit products leads to greater li -
quidity risk. Funding through deposits entails 
less control over the maturity structure, which 
is becoming particularly apparent in the current 
interest rate setting. Moreover, in contrast to 
capital market funding, deposit-  b ased funding 
cannot be managed directly by banks but only 
indirectly by structuring the terms and condi -
tions. The categories of banks that rely heavily 
on deposits for funding have clearly shortened 
maturities on the liabilities side of their balance 
sheets. This contrasts with the maturities and 
interest rate fixation periods of loans on the 
assets side which have not been shortened to the same extent. For this reason, the balance 
sheets of the networked institutions in particu -
lar are exposed to a heightened maturity trans-
formation risk.
Overall, moderate growth was recorded in the 
volume of loans to non-  banks. Lending busi -
ness received a boost primarily from loans for 
house purchase. Growth in this segment 
amounted to 2.4% given the exceptionally fa -
vourable financing conditions – bank lending 
rates on new loans for house purchase as a 
whole dropped considerably during the course 
of the year from 2.8% to 2.1% – and the lack 
of attractive alternative investment opportun -… heightens

ities. The large volume of financial assets that 
households have at their disposal is likely in it -
self to have prevented even greater growth in 
lending for house purchase. The volume of 
loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased by 1.6% overall. 
By contrast, lending to the public sector fell sig -
nificantly due to the favourable state of public finances.
The hitherto favourable funding situation was 
also reflected in the gross interest rate spread.12 
Whereas the volume-  weighted inter est rates 
for deposits as well as loans in existing and 
new business fell to new all-  time lows, the  
gross interest rate spread13 across all credit seg-
ments remained at the previous year’s levels of 
3.2% for existing business and 2.0% for new 
business. In the German banking sector, inter -
est income from traditional lending business as 
well as interest expenditure has been declining 
for years, according to the profit and loss stat-
istics. Whereas this interest income came to 
€189.5 billion (just over 65% of the long-  term 
average) in the reporting year, interest expend-
iture, at €113.3 billion, was only half of its long-  
term average. However, future scope for stabil -
ising margins will probably become increasingly 
limited given the very low level that interest 
expenditure has reached in the meantime. The 
fact that deposit rates are close to the zero 
lower bound leaves very little scope for further 
interest rate cuts, not least in terms of business 
and competition policy.
The interest margin, calculated as the ratio of 
net interest income to the balance sheet total,14 
climbed 9 basis points on the year to 1.10%. 
Adjusted for the low-  mar gin interbank busi -
ness, which is closely oriented to market rates, 
the interest margin rose 12 basis points to 
1.43%. The interest margin gives an important indication of the general profitability of chiefly 
those credit institutions which focus on trad -
itional deposit and lending business. This cat -
egory of banks primarily comprises credit co-
operatives and savings banks, whose interest 
margins in the reporting year, at 2.21% and 2.09% respectively and as a long-  term aver age, 
were considerably better than for all other 
banking groups.
The only categories of banks to record a drop 
in net interest received were the Landesbanken 
and the regional institutions of credit coopera -
tives. The substantial decline, by around 23% 
to €1.1 billion, sustained by the latter was 
largely attributable to an accounting-  r elated 
special item at one institution.15 As a result, the 
percentage share of net interest received in this 
group’s total operating income was, at close to 
57%, considerably lower than in the previous 
year. Net interest received generated by the 
Landesbanken, which were affected by restruc-
turing measures, fell slightly to €8.2 billion as Gross interest

12 The gross interest rate spread, which gives an indication

15 This was the result of the conversion from the internal 
procedure of the linear repayment value to the accrual 
method using the effective interest rate, which burdened 
net interest income to the tune of €193 million. Adjusted 
for this effect, net interest income for this category of

they further reduced their balance sheet total. 
Given the sharp drop in net trading income, 
however, net interest income contributed 
around 90% to operating income, which was 
distinctly up on the year. By contrast, mortgage 
banks, which also carried out restructuring 
measures and reduced their balance sheets, 
saw their net interest income grow consider -
ably to around €2 billion.16 Despite this, its 
share of operating income went down from around 104% to just over 94%. In the 2013 
reporting year, the effect of a negative balance 
in their net other operating result led to net 
interest received exceeding the 100% mark in 
terms of their operating income; this in itself underlines how much this category of banks 
depends on net interest received. On a long-  
term average they generated around 99% of 
their operating income from net interest re -
ceived, making them the least diversified in 
terms of their sources of income. Up slightly in 
both cases, net interest received as a percent -
age of operating income came to almost 80% (€23.2 billion) for savings banks and to just 
over 79% (€17.1 billion) for credit cooperatives. 
Thus, they remained stable at the level of the 
long-  term aver age. The decline in their funding 
costs in particular allowed the big banks to ex -
pand their net interest income markedly to 
€20.4 billion, just under one-  thir d of which was 
attributable to current income and income from profit pooling. The percentage share of 
net interest received in operating income, 
which is usually lower than in other categories 
of banks, rose appreciably to 64.8%Structural data on German credit institutions*

16 This improved figure, which clearly more than offset the 
decline resulting from the reduction in interest-  bearing  
assets, was largely due to one mortgage bank. In the pre -

Improvement in net 
 commission income
In the German banking sector, net commission 
income (also referred to as net commissions re -
ceived), the second most important income 
source for German credit institutions, rose 
markedly by just over 4% to €29.8 billion. Net 
commission income accounted for 24.6% of 
operating income, which was only marginally 
up on the year; however, this was perceptibly 
higher than the long-  term aver age. The sum of 
net interest income and net commission in -
come accounted for 99% of operating income in the reporting year. Given the persistent pres -
sure on margins in interest business, the earn-
ings potential of net commission income is 
growing in importance. Net commission in -
come stems mainly from income from and ex -
penditure on services such as payments as well 
as foreign trade, securities commission and safe custody business. Other components are 
intermediation activities related to loan con -
tracts, savings agreements, savings and loan 
contracts as well as insurance contracts. More -
over, the costs of providing government guar -
antees are recognised as an expense under the 
net commission income of Landesbanken. The 
areas of activity as well as the scope and type 
of the commission business differ considerably, 
depending on the respective business model.
The national and international equity markets benefited from the accommodative monetary 
policy and the drop in oil prices. Even so, rising 
geopolitical tensions in the second half of the 
year were a particular factor that had a damp-
ening effect on developments in the euro-  ar ea 
equity markets.17 Sales of public sector bonds 
on German securities exchanges fell to new all-  
time lows. The transaction volume on German 
stock exchanges was also low compared with 
the long-  term aver age. In line with this, net 
commission income from securities-  r elated 
transactions on the equity and bond markets is likely to have been only moderate. As an alter -
native form of investment, however, invest -
ment fund shares were again sought after, which, in itself, boosted net commission in -
come. At €136 billion, sales were slightly up on 
the year in Germany and at their highest level 
since 1993. Once again, the main focus of de -
mand was on specialised funds, which are of 
particular interest to institutional investors; at a 
total of just under €94 billion, they accounted 
for roughly 69% of total sales. With regard to 
retail funds, private investors seeking sufficient, 
less volatile returns mainly turned to mixed se-
curity-  based funds. In addition, net commission 
income from safe custody account manage -
ment probably benefited from valuation gains 
on securities holdings in the customer ac -
counts.18 The heightened demand for insur -
ance products under old terms and conditions 
in response to the planned lowering of the 
guaranteed return on life insurance policies at 
the start of 2015 (from 1.75% to 1.25%) must 
also have had a positive effect.
In particular, big banks with a heavy business 
focus on the international capital markets gen-
erated, on a long-  term average, just under 34% 
of the net commission income aggregated across all categories of banks. They improved 
the figure by €0.6 billion year-  on-  year to €1 1.3 Distinct rise in

billion, thus playing a major part in the increase 
in the aggregate total.19 The big banks’ strong 
market position in commissions business also 
becomes clear when net commissions received 
are compared with net interest received, this 
ratio standing at just over 55% in the reporting 
year. In all other categories of banks, net com -
mission income did not even come close to half 
of net interest received. Besides providing secur -
ities transactions services, the networked insti -
tutions mainly draw their commission income from payment transactions and the brokerage 
of  financial pr oducts offered by the respective 
network partners. These earnings contributions are less dependent on the volatile financial mar -
ket setting and comparatively stable. Not least 
as a result of higher fees for payment transac-
tions, each of the networked institutions raised 
their net commissions received slightly, record -
ing new highs of €6.4 billion (savings banks) 
and €4.3 billion (credit cooperatives) since 1993. 
In the year under review, net income from com -
missions business contributed 22.1% to operat-
ing income in the savings bank sector and 20.1% in the case of the credit cooperatives. Net commission income in the Landesbanken 
sector was again depressed by high levels of ex -
penditure for the provision of government guar -
antees in the case of individual Landesbanken. 
When looking at the overall profitability of the 
Landesbanken sector, it should be borne in mind that the expenditure for premium pay -
ments was offset by high income from pay -
ments under guarantees, which had a positive 
effect on the net valuation result. Compared 
with the previous year, the sector’s net commis -
sions received rose slightly to €0.8 billion, but 
were nonetheless considerably lower than the 
long-  term average.
Net trading result 
 significantly down
In a setting of financial markets prone to fluctu -
ations, the net trading result, which is typically 
highly volatile, deteriorated by almost 40% to 
€3.6 billion. This development was affected, in 
particular, by valuation and exchange rate 
changes as well as transactions relating to the 
special item pursuant to section 340  e (4 ) of 
the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch).20 The share of operating income con -
tributed by the net trading result declined by 
just under 2 percentage points to 3%, thus ap -
proaching the long-  term aver age. According to 
the published annual reports, trading business 
rarely constitutes proprietary trading originat -
ing in the institutions, but rather is dominated 
by customer-  initiated business.
The net trading result is traditionally more im -
portant for the regional institutions of credit 
cooperatives than for the other categories of 
banks; the regional institutions boosted their 
net trading income by one-  thir d to €0.5 billion, 
mainly due to value adjustments. The share of Net trading

19 Part of this income effect is purely accounting-  r elated 
and attributable to reclassifications to and from the net 
trading result at one big bank. The relevant prior-  year fig -
ures were not adjusted in the profit and loss statistics.20
 Pursuant to section 340  e (4 ) of the German Commer -
cial Code, an amount corresponding to at least 10% of net income in the trading book must be allocated each finan -
cial year to the special item “Fund for general banking 
risks” pursuant to section 340  g and pr esented separately 
in that item. It may only be reversed to offset net expend-iture in the trading book, to offset a loss that is not covered by profit brought forward from the previous year, to offset a loss brought forward that is not covered by net profit for the year, or if it exceeds 50% of the average net income in the trading book for the last five years.Deutsche Bundesbank

the net trading result in operating income rose 
by just over 7 percentage points to around 
23%. By contrast, various factors caused the 
big banks to record a decline in their net result 
of almost one-  thir d to €2.6 billion. This meant 
that its share in operating income shrank by 
nearly 4 percentage points to somewhat more 
than 8%. In the Landesbanken sector, the pre -
vious year’s high disposal and valuation gains 
were not repeated, which meant that the net 
gain from trading went down massively by 
€1.2 billion to €0.1 billion. Its share in operat -
ing income likewise fell immensely by more 
than 11 percentage points to just over 1%. In 
the other categories of banks, the net trading 
result, as is customary, did not play a notable 
role in the reporting year.
Considerable expansion 
of negative balance of net 
other operating result
The net other operating result deteriorated by 
€1.6 billion to -€2.4 billion, hitting its lowest 
level since 1993. This summary item is used to 
record earnings and expenses that form part of 
operating business, but have no connection to 
the net interest, commission or trading result. 
Besides the net result from leasing business and currency translation
21 as well as the gross result 
from transactions in goods and subsidiary 
transactions, this item is also used to book pro -
visions for, inter alia, litigation risk and the risk 
of legal recourse – in some categories of banks 
these have been growing in scale in recent 
years. Furthermore, according to the published 
annual reports, many of the institutions use the 
option introduced when the Act to Modernise Accounting Law (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungs-
gesetz) was implemented in 2010, which allows 
them to report income effects arising from the 
change in the discount rate for pension provi -
sions as a component of the financial result ra -
ther than in staff costs.22 The published annual 
reports reveal that these amounts are often 
recognised in the net other operating result. In 
particular, the persistent low-  inter est-  r ate envir -onment and the changeover, as part of the 
 implementation of the Act to Modernise 
 Accounting Law, in the valuation method23 for 
calculating the reportable present values of 
pension obligations are likely to have resulted 
in a distinct increase in these expenses. Taken 
by itself, the persistently declining discount 
interest rates have, for some years, been stead -
ily pushing up the present values to be deter -
mined. Moreover, the costs incurred in the re -
porting year in connection with the reimburse -
ment of loan processing fees24 weighed on the 
net other operating result in some categories 
of banks – heavily, in some cases.
The negative balance in the big banks sector 
grew considerably by just over one-  t hird to 
€2.8 billion, chiefly as a result of renewed high 
provisions for litigation costs. This category of 
banks thus reported its worst result since 1993.

21 Pursuant to section 277 (5) of the German Commercial 
Code, currency translation effects are to be recorded in the net other operating result, provided that use is not made of 
the option under the provisions of the Accounting Regula-
tion for Credit Institutions (Verordnung über die Rechnungs -
legung der Kreditinstitute) to recognise the effects of for -
eign currency translation in the item in which the net other 
valuation result of the translated balance sheet item or transaction is presented. See IDW Accounting Principle:

23 Prior to the implementation of the rules under the Act 
to Modernise Accounting Law, the discount rate applied in 
the valuation method for pension provisions was supposed to be within a general range of 3% to 6%; a discount rate 
within the range of between 4% and 4.5% was normally 
used. The lower valuation threshold was the value deter -
mined according to the entry age normal method (pursu -
ant to section 6a of the Income Tax Act ( Einkommensteuer -
gesetz )) with a discount rate of 6%. The new rules con -
tained in the Act to Modernise Accounting Law stipulate 
that pension provisions with a residual maturity of more 
than one year are to be discounted at the average market interest rate of the last seven years corresponding to their residual maturity. Alternatively, disregarding the principle of 
item-  by-  item valuation, it is permissible to discount al l pen -
sion provisions with the average market interest rate that 
results assuming a residual maturity of 15 years.24 In its judgments of May and October 2014, the Federal 
Court of Justice confirmed the unlawfulness of loan pro-
cessing fees, since the processing of a loan is not a service for the customer. Rather, it is in the bank’s own interests to 
check the customer’s solvency and prepare the contract. In 
compliance with certain limitation periods, therefore, re -
imbursements of loan processing fees paid in the last ten 
years can be requested.Deutsche Bundesbank

At the same time, net income in the category 
of regional banks and other commercial banks 
was down by far more than half, to just €0.5 
billion. The main strain here was caused by 
high expenses in connection with the reim -
bursement of loan processing fees by individual 
banks. Developments in the Landesbanken sec -
tor were mixed; the net other operating result 
in this category fell by €0.3 billion, just dipping 
into negative territory.
Increased administrative 
spending
The banks’ cost side is largely shaped by ad -
ministrative spending, which rose slightly by 
around €1 billion to just under €83.9 billion 
and comprises staff costs and other administra -
tive spending. Staff costs, which grew only 
marginally by €0.1 billion to €43.2 billion, are 
divided into wage and salary payments and 
other staff costs. Across all categories of banks, wage and salary payments rose slightly to €34.8 billion. In the context of continued job 
cuts, this figure reflected the moderate wage 
and salary increases from the collective wage agreements concluded in 2012 and 2014. 
Other staff costs, which include social security 
costs and costs relating to pensions and other 
benefits, stood at the previous year’s level of €8.5 billion. In this item, the countervailing 
 effects of lower social security costs and higher 
pension expenditure offset each other.
Other administrative costs rose perceptibly by 
€0.8 billion to €40.6 billion. These primarily in-
clude the costs of operating premises and of -
fices, non-  staf f costs, expenditure on external 
services such as audit and consultancy costs as 
well as the costs of implementing regulatory requirements. In the year under review, the 
successes already achieved from savings and 
synergy effects are likely to have been offset in 
part by higher regulatory costs. Expenditure for 
the bank levy,25 which amounted to €0.5 billion 
in the reporting year, is also recognised primar -
ily in this item according to the published an -
nual reports.
The category of big banks made the largest contribution to the increase in other adminis -
trative costs in the German banking sector. 
Nevertheless, total administrative spending in 
this category of banks fell slightly to €24.7 bil -
lion, as staff costs were declining. The net -
worked institutions, whose relatively dense 
branch network has a considerably negative 
effect, when viewed in isolation, on the cost 
item of other administrative costs, reported 
other administrative costs of €7.3 billion (sav -
ings banks) and €5.7 billion (credit coopera -
tives), which were, respectively, slightly lower 
and slightly higher than the previous year’s fig -
ures. With staff costs up, administrative spend -
ing as a whole rose slightly in both categories 
of banks.Staff costs

Cost/income ratio  
at prior-  year level
The cost/income ratio expresses the ratio of ad -
ministrative spending to operating income. It is 
a measure of cost efficiency and, alongside the 
return on equity, is one of the key performance 
indicators of an enterprise. In principle, the 
lower the ratio is, the more efficiently a bank 
generates its earnings. In the year under re -
view, cost efficiency stood at the previous 
year’s level of 69% given increased operating 
income and administrative spending, but was 
poorer than the long-  term average.
Compared with the other categories of banks, 
the cost/income ratio of the big banks, which 
are actually most likely to benefit from econ -
omies of scale, revealed the lowest cost effi -
ciency both in the reporting year (78.1%) and 
as a long-  term aver age (76.4%). In the case of 
the Landesbanken, which usually have one of 
the most favourable ratios, the poor net trad -
ing result, in particular, dragged on operating 
income. As a result, their cost efficiency de -
creased, with the ratio, at 70.9%, rising to its 
worst level since 1993. In the context of virtu-
ally unchanged operating income, the ratios of 
the savings banks and credit cooperatives were 
within the usual range, at 68.3% and 65.9% 
respectively. Cost efficiency clearly deteriorated 
at the regional institutions of credit coopera -
tives, chiefly owing to distinctly diminishing 
 operating income; at 59.3%, the cost/income 
ratio was somewhat higher than the long-  term 
average. The profitability of the mortgage 
banks has been shaped for some years by re -
structuring measures and portfolio reduction. 
Net interest received, in particular, has been 
declining sharply since 2010, while the reduc -
tion in administrative costs has been signifi -
cantly more moderate. In the year under re -
view, they needed just over 58% of their oper -
ating income to cover administrative expenses, 
whereas the figure was merely a little under 
40% on a long-  term aver age. They are thus 
one of the categories of banks with the highest cost efficiency. Nevertheless, depending on the respective business model, there are clear dif -
ferences between the composition and amount 
of administrative costs as well as the earnings 
potential of operating business in the German 
banking sector. For instance, even though they 
were among the categories of banks with the 
highest cost efficiency in the long-  t erm aver -
age, the Landesbanken and mortgage banks generated the poorest return on equity fig -
ures,26 both in the reporting year (-0.63% and 
-1.03% respectively) and on a long-  t erm aver -Cost efficiency

age (3.6% and 5.5% respectively). For the net -
worked institutions, on the other hand, this 
ratio showed the best profitability in the Ger -
man banking system.
In response to limited earnings prospects, fierce 
competition, and owing to a lack of alterna -
tives for expanding into new areas of business, 
German banks are increasingly trying to opti -
mise their cost side, focusing on mergers, ad -
justments to branch structures, restructuring 
lines of business and outsourcing cost-  intensive 
functions. Savings banks and credit coopera -
tives, in particular, continued to reduce their 
branch numbers, for example. In total, the 
number of savings bank branches was reduced 
by 372 to 11,951, and branches of credit co-operatives were decreased by 272 to 11,269 
branches. The reduction in the big banks sector 
of 167 branches to 7,443 was essentially due 
to a single institution which had announced in 
2013 that it planned to carry out such meas -
ures.Net valuation result  
at a low level
Although the net valuation result (risk provi -
sion) was again very favourable compared with 
the long-  term aver age, it showed a slight year-  
on- year deterior ation of €0.4 billion to -€6.9 
billion amid mixed developments across the 
categories of banks. Along with the effects of 
write-  ups, write-  downs and value adjustments 
on accounts receivable and securities in the 
 liquidity reserve, the net valuation result also 
encompasses risk provisioning for off-  balance  
sheet credit operations. In addition, transfers 
and releases relating to undisclosed reserves 
pursuant to section 340 f of the German Com -
mercial Code are included in the net valuation 
result, impacting on the net profit or loss. By 
contrast, transfers relating to disclosed reserves 
pursuant to section 340  g of the German Com -
mercial Code (fund for general banking risks) 
are shown in this profit and loss analysis in the 
context of profit distribution. The net valuation 
result makes use of the cross-  offsetting op -
tion27 permissible under the German Commer -
cial Code.
Primarily thanks to robust economic conditions 
and the good portfolio quality overall, debt 
provisioning was again at a low level. The 
downward trend for several years in the num-
ber of business and consumer insolvencies also 
continued in the year under review. In fact, the 
number of business insolvencies was at its low -
est level since the Insolvency Code was intro -
duced in 1999.28 Along with the favourable 
interest rate environment and the strong profit -
ability of German non-  fi nancial enterprises,

had a positive effect. In addition, the special 
accounting-  r elated effect arising from the re -
allocation of undisclosed reserves as disclosed 
reserves is likely to have had a favourable im -
pact on the net valuation result.29
In most categories of banks, the net valuation 
result was considerably better than the long-  
term average. For the fourth time in succes -
sion, the savings banks recorded net income 
from the valuation of assets, although the fig -
ure was very low. The regional institutions of 
credit cooperatives turned their net valuation 
result of -€0.3 billion in the preceding year into 
a small positive balance. Considerably influ -
enced by special factors – although these also 
offset each other in some cases – net valuation 
charges for credit risk provisioning in the Lan -
desbanken sector fell by more than half to €1.6 
billion; the high charges arising from valuation 
adjustments to claims and debt forgiveness vis-  
à- vis certain equity inter ests at one Landesbank 
were accompanied by substantial income from 
the effect of the guarantee at another Landes -
bank. The big banks posted the worst net valu -
ation result, with their net transfers almost trip-ling to €2.7 billion. This was chiefly attributable 
to declining capital gains from the sale of se -
curities in the liquidity reserve at a single insti -
tution.
Operating result  
at prior-  year level
At 75%, the share of operating income re -
quired to fund administrative spending and the 
net valuation result was markedly below the 
long-  term aver age. The German credit institu -
tions posted a profit of around €31 billion from 
their operating business, which was on the 
same level as in the previous year.
The persistently low costs of banks’ risk provi -
sioning, in particular, proved to be a mainstay 
of profitability. For example, at just 5.7% of op -
erating income, considerably less profit was 
needed to offset the net charges from the valu -ation of assets than on the long-  term average. 
If the share of operating income required to 
cover the costs of risk provisioning in the year 
under review had been on the same level as 
the long-  term aver age, the operating result 
would have been substantially – roughly €10 
billion – lower.

loss in the stricter sense,30 the result from fi -
nancial investment business31 as well as loss 
transfers.32 In addition, charges arising from 
profit transfers33 are recorded here, as they 
cannot be assigned to actual operating busi -
ness. Having undergone a substantial drop of 
29% overall to €6.5 billion, the negative bal -
ance was close to the long-  term aver age for 
the first time since the crisis year of 2008.
The overall positive development in the Ger -
man banking sector’s other and extraordinary 
income or charges account was mainly driven 
by the huge €1.7 billion improvement in the 
extraordinary result, in the stricter sense, to 
-€0.7 billion. However, conflicting effects had 
an influence on this balance; for example, the 
high restructuring charges in the case of the 
mortgage banks – these primarily affected a 
single bank – contrasted with strongly reduced 
charges for restructuring, above all in the big 
banks and Landesbank sectors. Also affected 
by contrasting factors, the negative balance from financial investment business fell signifi -
cantly to €1.7 billion, down by €0.4 billion. The 
savings banks and big banks, in particular, re -
duced their net charges considerably; in add -
ition to write-  u ps and profits from sales, this 
was chiefly due to fewer write-  downs from the

30 Only extraordinary events which interrupt the normal

ment or on a voluntary basis. The superordinated enter -

while the subordinated enterprise receives income from

affiliated enterprises of one big bank. By con -
trast, the Landesbanken almost quadrupled 
their net loss from financial investment busi -
ness, principally as a result of high expenditure 
arising from a payment obligation in connec -
tion with the decisions stemming from an EU 
state aid procedure. Charges arising from profit 
transfers, which were largely concentrated on 
the group of regional banks and other com -
mercial banks, showed a marked fall of €1 bil-
lion to €3.8 billion. The contribution to the re -
sult from loss transfers went into negative terri-
tory and was down €0.2 billion on account of 
significantly declining income. One mortgage 
bank was particularly affected by this; as a re -
sult of the advanced stage of portfolio reduc -
tion as part of the implementation of EU re -
quirements, its risk provisioning expenses were 
considerably lower and the profit situation thus 
much better. Consequently, income from losses 
transferred to the superordinated enterprise 
plummeted to less than one-  tenth of the pr evi-
ous year’s value.
Increased profit for the 
 financial year and  
balance sheet profit
In the year under review, the German credit in -
stitutions saw distinct growth in their annual 
profit before tax. At €24.2 billion on balance, a 
rise of just under 13%, the result was also con -
siderably above the long-  term aver age. The in -
creased profit at the aggregate level was mostly 
concentrated on the special-  purpose banks, 
whose net interest received figures benefited 
from the elimination of a negative accounting-  
related special item34. By contrast, the credit 
cooperatives saw an appreciable decline in 
their profit for the financial year before tax, as 
it fell from €7.7 billion to €7 billion. The savings 
bank sector recorded a profit of €8.7 billion, 
which was marginally up on the year. Despite 
markedly higher operating income, the mort -
gage banks posted a loss of €0.2 billion, which 
was due mainly to the high negative balance in 
the extraordinary account. This followed a sur -plus of €0.1 billion in the preceding financial year. The Landesbanken improved their result 
and reduced their annual loss slightly to €0.4 
billion. Here, the effects of the visible deterior -
ation in operating income and the considerably 
more favourable net valuation charges offset 
each other to a large extent. Generally speak-
ing, the other categories of banks posted mod -
erate growth.
Since the crisis year of 2008, balance sheet 
capital has strengthened substantially by al -
most one-  thir d to €428 billion, but was mas -
sively influenced by the reallocation of undis -
closed reserves as disclosed reserves, especially in 2011 and 2012.
35 Higher balance sheet cap -
ital as a result of this reallocation did not raise the liable capital base to the same extent, how -
ever, as the undisclosed reserves could be used 
to back prudential risks under certain circum -
stances even before the reallocation.36 In order 
to hedge against the special risks of banking 
business and to satisfy more stringent pruden -
tial capital requirements, €10.2 billion net (compared with €7.6 billion in the previous 
year) was transferred from the profit for the 
 reporting year to the fund for general banking 
risks. The networked institutions accounted for more than half of this. Reserves and participa -
tion rights capital, on the other hand, were 
 reduced by €3.4 billion on balance. The main 
negative factors were the release of reserves to 
offset a very high annual loss at one Landes -
bank as well as to offset high losses brought forward at individual mortgage banks. In net 
terms, balance sheet capital from internal Profit for finan-

36 With the implementation of the Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR) on 1 January 2014, more stringent uni -
form criteria for recognising regulatory capital components 
as well as stricter and harmonised rules for deductions 
 applied in the calculation of the capital base were intro -
duced at EU level. Undisclosed reserves’ eligibility for rec -
ognition as Tier  2 capital was limited. The ability to al locate 
disclosed reserves without qualification to Common Equity 
Tier 1  capital remained unchanged. To strengthen their 
core capital base and in anticipation of the planned tight-
ening of regulatory requirements, several institutions had 
reclassified undisclosed reserves as disclosed reserves – on 
a considerable scale in some cases – during 2011 and 
2012, in particular.Deutsche Bundesbank

Return on equity of German banks – 
interpretation and  determinants
Return on equity expresses a bank’s annual 
profi  t in relation to its balance sheet capital 
and captures the rate of return on the equity employed within a given accounting period. 
It is used as a measure for estimating an  enterprise’s profi  tability. However, valid statements can only be made under the conditions that the defi  nitions of annual profi  t and equity capital are disclosed and 
that any special factors are taken into con-
sideration. In an international comparison, the informative value of this fi  gure is ex-
tremely limited as no harmonised set of data covering the entire banking system exists as yet. The major differences be tween the Ger-
man (German Commercial Code (Handels-gesetzbuch or HGB)) and the international 
(International Financial Reporting Standards 
or IFRSs) accounting rules are the underlying principle (HGB: principle of prudence versus 
IFRS: fair value principle) and the way in which enterprises are required to report (HGB: single entity versus IFRS: consoli-
dated). In the context of Germany, return on 
equity is regularly commented on in the 
Monthly Report articles regarding the profi  t-
ability of German banks based on the time 
series from the profi  t and loss statistics. It is 
calculated as the ratio of annual profi  t de-rived from the HGB single- entity fi  nancial statements to the average annual balance 
sheet capital determined on the basis of the monthly balance sheet statistics.
Besides the purely accounting- based aggre-
gation of the profi  t and loss accounts 
shown in the relevant HGB single- entity fi  -
nancial statements, the essential aim of the 
profi  t and loss statistics is to disclose to its 
broad target audience the profi  tability of 
the German banking system as a whole and 
of the individual categories of banks from 
an economic perspective. Due to this ap-
proach, which is primarily oriented towards 
economic performance, individual items in 
the profi  t and loss statistics may, in some 
cases, be reported in a different way than in 
the HGB profi  t and loss account. For ex-
ample, to make provisions for the particular risks of banking business, the German Com-
mercial Code allows credit institutions to 
form undisclosed reserves pursuant to sec-
tion 340 f and disclosed reserves pursuant 
to section 340 g. Pursuant to the provisions of the German Commercial Code, establish-ing and reversing undisclosed as well as dis-
closed reserves is always to be reported as 
income or expense with the corresponding impact on the level of annual profi  t. In devi-ation from the requirements of the German 
Commercial Code, the establishment and reversal of disclosed reserves pursuant to section 340 g of the Code is not recorded 
as income or expense in the profi  t and loss statistics, but is recognised only later in the 
context of profi  t distribution; due to their proximity to retained profi  ts, the Bundes-
bank holds the view that recognising these 
components as income or expense would not appropriately refl  ect actual economic performance.

tice does not differ between the profi  t and 
loss statistics and the Commercial Code 
provisions regarding income recognition when undisclosed reserves are established and reversed pursuant to section 340 f of 
the Code; instead, these reserves are com-
parable to general provisions and are also 
included in the net valuation result, where 
they are indistinguishable due to cross- 
offsetting.
In particular between 2011 and 2012, many 
institutions, above all in the savings and 
 cooperative bank sector, reclassifi  ed undis-
closed as disclosed reserves – not least in 
preparation for meeting stricter regulatory capital requirements.
2 This reclassifi  cation 
effect did not have an impact on annual profi  t determined in line with the German 
Commercial Code, but caused annual profi  t in the profi  t and loss statistics to rise – mas-sively, in some cases – for a number of cat-
egories of banks. The charts on page  44 
(The performance of credit institutions) and 
page  57 (Credit institutions’ equity and profi  t for the fi  nancial year) illustrate the 
discrepancies in the data between the profi  t 
and loss statistics and the German Com-
mercial Code provisions.The effects will gradually fade over time 
and the data in the profi  t and loss statistics 
will eventually return to refl  ecting actual economic performance. However, the re-
turn on equity setting annual profi  t as cal-
culated in line with the German Commer-
cial Code in relation to balance sheet cap-
ital, as a reference value for return on equity as calculated pursuant to the profi  t and loss 
statistics, will probably continue in the  future to provide a sound contribution to 
avoiding misinterpretations.
The main text of this article focuses on  annual profi  t before tax in the context of calculating return on equity. Alternatively, 
however, annual profi  t after tax may also be used as a reference fi  gure. Given that, on a 
long- term average, taxes on income and earnings amount to just over 43% of an-
nual profi  t before tax, return on equity after 
tax is substantially lower than return on 
equity before tax.

 financing grew by €6.9 billion. Regarding the 
interpretation of these results, it should be 
noted that some time-  r elated inconsistencies 
are associated with the compilation of the an -
nual accounts (comprising the balance sheet 
and the profit and loss account). For example, 
the amounts transferred from the profit for the 
financial year do not increase balance sheet 
capital until the following year after the annual accounts are adopted, while withdrawals from 
equity items are to be deducted from balance 
sheet capital at the latest when the annual 
 accounts are prepared.
Return on equity37 expresses annual profit in re-
lation to balance sheet capital and captures the 
rate of return on the equity employed within a 
given accounting period. It is used as a key measure for estimating an enterprise’s profit -
ability. Calculated as the ratio of profit for the 
financial year before taxes to balance sheet 
capital based on the data provided in the profit 
and loss statistics, it improved by 0.4 percent -age point on the year to 5.7%, but was still 
significantly below the long-  term aver age. Re -
turn on equity after tax was 4.0% for the year 
under review (see the box on pages 60 and 61, 
Return on equity of German banks – interpret -
ation and determinants).
Taking due account of slightly increased taxes 
on income and earnings, as well as persistently 
high losses brought forward, credit institutions 
achieved a balance sheet profit – in the amount 
of €1.8 billion – at the aggregate level for the 
first time since 2007. This was mainly driven by 
the release of reserves by individual mortgage 
banks in order to offset high losses brought 
forward. Hence, the overall balance sheet loss 
was reduced significantly by €2.8 billion to €6.1 
billion. As in the previous year, it was a small 
number of special-  purpose banks, mortgage  
banks and individual banks in the category of 
regional banks and other commercial banks Return on equity

national banknotes still in circulation. 10The German contributions to the Euro- banknotes actually issued by the Bundesbank and the amount disclosed in
system’s monetary aggregates should on no account be interpreted as national accordance with the accounting regime chosen by the Eurosystem (see also footnote
monetary aggregates and are therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German 2 on banknote circulation in Table III.2).
