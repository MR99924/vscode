Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Following the disappointing economic data for 
June, the July data came as a positive surprise. 
This dispels fears of the upturn in aggregate economic output coming to an abrupt end. 
Apart from the continuing positive business cli-mate, other factors arguing against such a de-velopment are that the labour market is in very 
good shape and that consumers have not ad -
justed their income expectations or their plans 
for consumption despite the gloomier outlook 
for the economy. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that the start to the third quarter 
benefited considerably from special factors and therefore, when taken in isolation, gives a pic-
ture of economic activity that is too positive. The seasonally adjusted strong growth in in
-
dustrial output is largely due to the fact that 
most of the school holidays fell in August this 
year. As a result, holiday- related losses of out -
put in July were not as great as usual at this 
time of the year. A countermovement is to be 
expected for August. A major factor, in add -
ition to holiday- related effects, were major 
shipbuilding orders, the effect on output of which materialises only with a considerable 
time lag and over an extremely long period of time. The underlying pace of economic activity is likely to be captured better by confidence in-
dicators than by short- term changes in orders 
and production. These indicators went further 
into reverse in August, with not only business 
expectations but also assessments of the cur -
rent situation being rated more cautiously.
Industry
There was a sharp seasonally adjusted 2½% in-
crease in industrial output in July compared 
with the previous month. This was due in par -
ticular to many of the school holidays and plant shutdowns – especially in the automotive in -
dustry – being shifted to August, which is not 
covered by the usual seasonal adjustment. Compared with the average of the second 
quarter, there was an increase of 2¼%. There 
was marked growth of 4¾% in the manufac -
ture of capital goods. The extremely steep rise 
in automotive output was a key factor in this context. By contrast, output of intermediate and consumer goods was only slightly up on 
the quarter (+¼% in both cases).
Orders received by German industry in July 
were 4¾% up on the month after adjustment 
for seasonal variations. This was 2% higher 
than the average of the previous quarter. Holi-day effects likewise played a part in the positive figure for July. Added to this were major orders 
in shipbuilding. These came predominantly from non- euro- area countries, whose overall 
volume of orders showed an extremely sharp 
increase of 8¼%. This was also the main rea -
son for the steep overall 4% rise in export de-
mand, even though there was a clear drop of 
3% in orders from the rest of the euro area, mostly because of a smaller intake in the air
-
craft and aerospace industry. Furthermore, do-mestic orders did not quite match the average 
of the previous quarter (-¼%). There was an overall increase of 4% in orders of capital 
goods. The intermediate goods sector recorded slight growth (+½%). This contrasted with sig-
nificantly fewer orders for consumer goods 
(-3¼%).
Industrial sales in July were 1¼% up on the month after seasonal adjustment. Compared 
with the average of the second quarter, the in-crease was 1½%. In percentage terms, sales ex-
panded almost equally at home and abroad (+1½% and +1¾% respectively). Even so, growth in euro- area countries (2%) was 
stronger than in non- euro- area countries 
(+1¼%). Seasonally adjusted exports of goods 
in July showed a very strong increase of 4¾% Positive start to

compared with the preceding quarter. There 
was also a considerable rise of 5% in compari-
son with the average of the spring quarter. The 
value of imports in July was 1¾% down on the 
month. Nevertheless, it virtually matched the 
average level of the preceding quarter.
Construction
Construction output in July was 1¾% up on 
the month in seasonally adjusted terms. This 
was 1¼% up on the second quarter, which had been sharply depressed by the weather- related 
boost to the start of the year. Even so, there 
was a decline in year- on- year terms. Production 
in the main construction sector was ¾% higher than in the second quarter. There was a 1¾% 
increase in output in the finishing trades, the 
reports of which are subject to substantial revi-sion and are therefore to be regarded as highly 
provisional. After seasonal adjustment, orders 
received in the main construction sector in the 
second quarter of 2014 – figures are available 
up to then – were 4¾% down on their level in 
the first quarter. The decline was especially 
marked in the case of industrial orders. There 
was also a clear fall in housing construction. In addition, there was lack of perceptible demand impulses in public sector construction.
Labour market
The labour market continues to be in very good 
shape. In July, the seasonally adjusted number 
of persons in work in Germany showed a clear increase of 44,000 on the month. There was a year- on- year increase of 341,000, or 0.8%. Ac-
cording to estimates by the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, the number of employees sub -
ject to social security contributions showed a sharp seasonally adjusted rise of 90,000 in 
June compared with May, following an average 
increase of 48,000 in the first five months of this year. The year- on- year figure in June was 
+550,000 jobs subject to social security contri-butions (+1.9%). According to the Ifo employ-Higher construc-

Key ratios for m acroeconomic and government activity 
in Germany following the 2014 major revision of national accounts
In publishing detailed German data on eco-
nomic activity for the second quarter of 
2014, the Federal Statistical Offi   ce has pre-
sented a comprehensive picture of the re-
sults of the 2014 major revision of national 
accounts. This latest revision of the national 
accounts serves, above all, to implement 
the classifi  cation system used in the new European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 
2010)1. The task of recalculating the individ-
ual sub- aggregates back to 1991 based on 
the new methodological standards was concurrently used to undertake a funda-mental overhaul of the national accounts. 
This entailed incorporating new information 
from the primary statistics as well as previ-
ously unused data sources. In some in-
stances, new estimation methods were also applied. In addition, the usual mid- year revi-
sions were made to the national accounts 
data of the past three- and- a- half years, as a 
result of which information from delayed 
base statistics (in particular from the annual 
surveys) was factored into the macroeco-
nomic accounting system. Besides pushing 
up nominal gross domestic product (GDP) by an average of just over 3%, the 2014 major revision has also led to, in some 
cases, distinct revisions to various national 
accounts components, as a result of which 
some key macroeconomic relationships 
now appear differently. An international or 
European comparison of the revised Ger-
man data will not be possible until later in the year when new results for all countries have become available.
Export and import ratio
Particularly striking changes are discernible 
in the macroeconomic export and import 
ratios, which are frequently used to meas-
ure an economy’s integration into global 
trade or its real sector’s external dependen-
cies. These changes refl  ect the comprehen-
sive revision of the balance of payments statistics, which are used as the basis for calculating exports and imports of goods 
and services. The international conventions 
for systematically recording Germany’s multi- faceted external trade and payment 
links in the balance of payments were con-

currently revised and aligned with the na-
tional accounts rules.2 
The methodological basis for this revised 
set of rules is the currently applicable Bal-
ance of Payments and International Invest-
ment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6), 
which was drawn up jointly by the Inter-national Monetary Fund (IMF) and experts from other institutions, including the Bun-desbank. The new standard provides inter alia for new sub- account classifi  cations 
which, on the one hand, generate shifts be-tween goods and services transactions and, on the other, also modify the recorded vol-ume of total exports (exports of goods and receipts from services) and imports (imports of goods and expenditure on services). 
In particular, the changes in recording 
goods sent abroad for processing caused by 
the strict application of the change- of- ownership principle have sharply lowered 
trading volumes as goods sent abroad with-
out a change of ownership are no longer recorded in the trade balance. Instead of 
this, only the processing fee that an enter-
prise receives for processing the goods is 
recorded under receipts from services. 
Recorded goods fl  ows have been further re-
duced by the reclassifi  cation of the settle-
ment of commodity forward contracts in 
electricity and gas trading from the current 
account to the item “fi  nancial derivatives” within the fi  nancial account.
3 Moreover, 
transactions in non- physical gold holdings 
and construction work abroad rendered as 
part of a project lasting more than one year 
are likewise now recorded in the fi  nancial 
account.4 Overall, the revisions consistently 
produce signifi  cantly lower export and im-
port ratios; in 2013 these are around 5 per-
centage points lower than before. The measure for gauging the openness of the German economy, which is derived from national accounts ratios, has also changed 
accordingly. While the cyclical pattern of 
the export and import ratios remains largely unchanged, the upward trend is now some-
what fl  atter. The current account balance likewise looks somewhat different follow-ing the various revisions to the balance of payments statistics and the national ac-counts. In particular, the high surpluses 
seen in recent years turn out to be markedly lower in some cases. According to the new 
data, the 2013 current account balance 
amounts to 6.8% of nominal GDP , which is 0.7 percentage point below its pre- revision level.
Investment ratios
There are also some signifi  cant changes in 
aggregate investment, which is particularly 
affected by the reclassifi  cation of spending 
on research and development (R&D) as 
gross fi  xed capital formation.5 Since R&D 
expenditure in large part occurs in the pri-
vate sector, this raises the business investment-to-GDP ratio, in particular. By contrast, the long- term downward trend (owing primarily to the very moderate in-
crease in the price index for investment in 
machinery and equipment compared with 
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Changes in the method-
ology and classifi  cations of the balance of payments 
and the international investment position, Monthly 
 Report, June 2014, pp 57-68.3 The changeover to BPM6 has brought the account-
ing practice used for compiling Germany’s balance of 
payment statistics in line with the standard inter-
national procedure. Only actual cross- border electricity 
and gas deliveries as registered in the foreign trade 
statistics remain in the goods account.
4 In the case of the latter, only remuneration for the 
related construction services is still recorded as primary 
income in the current account. The construction ser-
vices themselves are assigned to domestic product.5 Previously, R&D expenditure was generally classifi  ed 
as intermediate consumption. Its capitalisation in the 
wake of the methodological changes introduced in 
ESA 2010 is the most signifi  cant factor behind the up-
ward revision of Germany’s GDP . See Deutsche Bun-
desbank, Impact on GDP of the 2014 major revision of 
national accounts, Monthly Report, August 2014, 
pp 58-59.Deutsche Bundesbank

the GDP defl  ator) remains virtually un-
changed, and the overall cyclical pattern is 
broadly the same, too. However, the major 
revision makes the cyclical weakness of the 
past two years look somewhat less pro-nounced than it did according to the old data. It should be noted that the adjust-
ments at the current end are likely to have been caused more by data  revisions than by methodological changes.
The government investment ratio likewise 
appears higher following the major revision. This is due not just to the modifi  ed approach 
to recording R&D spending but also the 
shifting of expenditure on military weapon 
systems from intermediate consumption (as 
part of government consumption) to gov-
ernment investment. On average during the revision period, the government investment 
ratio was adjusted upwards by ½ percent-age point, which is a much bigger adjust-ment in relation to the pre- revision level than that recorded for the private sector. 
However, its evolution over time has barely 
changed. Following higher investment ratios during the boom immediately after German 
reunifi  cation, the share of government in-vestment in GDP contracted until around the turn of the millennium and has been 
comparatively static since that date.
Private investment in residential construc-
tion has not been affected to the same ex-tent by methodological changes. While this 
investment component’s share in GDP has 
fallen slightly owing to the upward adjust-
ment of the denominator, it is notable that 
in 2012 and 2013 this reduction was evi-
dently more than offset by data- related re-
visions. Hence, the recent adjustments in 
the housing market now appear somewhat 
more marked compared with the pre- 
revision fi  gures.Wage share
The aggregate wage share as a cost vari-
able, measured here as the sum of compen-sation of employees in Germany relative to 
nominal gross value added, is now slightly 
smaller than it was prior to the major revi-
sion.6 This seems to be due mostly to the 
upward adjustment of the denominator, which more than neutralised rising com-
pensation levels induced inter alia by higher 
6 This contrasts with the rise in the wage share derived 
from the income breakdown of GDP , which is meas-
ured as the share of compensation of employees in 
national income.Investment ratios

employment.7 The Federal Employment 
Agency’s revised employment statistics, 
which were incorporated into the major re-
vision of the national accounts, factor in 
additional groups of individuals so as to broadly match the defi  nition of employ-
ment used by the International Labour Or-
ganization (ILO). This notably includes per-
sons employed in workshops for the dis-
abled.8 Similarly, the cyclical pattern of the 
wage share has not been much affected by 
the major revision. Nonetheless, it is note-
worthy that its downward movement up to 
2007 is now somewhat weaker and the subsequent recovery somewhat stronger 
than shown previously.
Saving ratioThe household saving ratio is affected by re-
visions of both disposable income and 
household fi  nal consumption expenditure. Private consumption was largely adjusted upwards in the wake of the major revision 
of national accounts.9 In the case of dispos-
able income (including the change in the net equity of households in pension fund 
reserves) there were initially upward correc-tions up until 2009, followed by downward revisions. On balance, the household saving 
ratio shown in the national accounts has 
contracted. The cyclical pattern of the sav-
ing ratio remains more or less the same, though the increase in the period from 2000 to 2008 appears distinctly weaker under the new accounting methodology. The main reason for the lowering of the 
saving ratio is likely to be higher consump-
tion of fi  xed capital in the form of dwell-ings. This reduces the (net) operating sur-
plus included in disposable income, which 
in the household sector mainly results from 
the use of dwellings by owner- occupiers. Using the gross defi  nition of the saving ratio, whereby the consumption of fi  xed capital is included, the corrections are far 
smaller. The underlying trend of a declining 
household saving ratio since 2008 is con-
fi  rmed in both cases, however.
7 Moreover, the revision of employers’ imputed social 
contributions along with higher gross wages and salar-ies recorded as a result of including stock options and 
of adjusting the wages and salaries of part- time low- 
paid workers have pushed up the compensation of 
employees fi  gure. See Federal Statistical Offi   ce. Major 
revision of national accounts in 2014: results and back-
ground, background paper on the press release of 
1 September 2014, p 5.8 See Federal Statistical Offi   ce, Information on the re-calculation of the numbers of persons in employment 
in Germany as part of the 2014 major revision of na-
tional accounts.
9 The principal reasons for the increase in household 
fi  nal consumption expenditure were new basic data due to redesigned calculation modules for trade and the inclusion of data on smuggled tobacco products 
and drugs as obtained by model calculations. See Fed-
eral Statistical Offi   ce, 2014 major revision of national 
accounts: results and background, background paper

Government consumption
The reclassifi  cation of spending on research 
and development and military weapon sys-tems has had only a very limited impact on the level of nominal government consump-
tion on balance. Thus while the reclassifi  ca-
tion of these components as capital forma-tion reduces government fi  nal consumption expenditure at the time of acquisition, their 
subsequent depreciation over time (due to 
the assumed capital consumption) increases 
government consumption.10 All in all, nom-
inal government consumption is actually 
higher following the major revision. This is 
likely to have resulted chiefl  y from the en-
larged recording of government personnel 
expenditure owing to recalculated imputed 
social contributions for government em-
ployees with civil servant status, who do 
not actually pay contributions to the statu-tory social security system.
11 However, in re-
lation to nominal GDP (given its signifi  cant 
upward revision), government consumption 
is slightly lower on average (¼ percentage 
point).
Key fi  scal ratiosThe major revision has affected a number of 
fi  scal ratios which play a key role in analys-ing the development of public fi  nances and 
the general government account.12 How-
ever, the overall picture for public fi  nances 
has not been changed fundamentally by 
the revision. For the government defi  cit 
ratio, the revisions are quantitatively negli-
gible on average and are also under 0.2 per-
centage point in each of the individual 10 Government consumption is calculated above all as 
the sum of intermediate consumption (notably goods 
and services consumed), personnel expenditure, social 
transfers in kind (in particular healthcare and long- term care insurance benefi  ts) and depreciation less sales (in 
particular, fees and charges received, but also intern-
ally produced goods and services). Specifi  cally, in the 
case of purchased goods (as is frequently the case for 
military weapons) the above- mentioned reclassifi  ca-
tion involves a shift of expenditure from intermediate 
consumption to capital formation. For internally pro-
duced goods (for example, research by a university be-longing to the government sector) the associated per-sonnel expenditure and intermediate consumption are 
still recorded, but these are offset by a sale (in the 
amount of the newly booked capital formation) which reduces consumption expenditure.
11 In general, the (notional) imputed social contribu-
tions for civil servants are recorded in the national ac-
counts on the one side under government personnel 
expenditure and on the other side under government 
revenue from social contributions. This is designed inter alia to allow a comparison of payroll costs for 
salaried staff and staff with civil servant status.
12 The government account shows government rev-
enue and expenditure and the general government fi  s-
cal balance according to the national accounts. The expenditure side includes inter alia the above- mentioned gross fi  xed capital formation, and, within 
government consumption, in particular personnel ex-
penditure, intermediate consumption and social trans-
fers in kind. Sales, which reduce government con-sumption expenditure, are recorded on the revenue side. Consumption of fi  xed capital is not taken into 
consideration in government revenue and expenditure and thus plays no role in calculating the fi  scal balance. 
Higher depreciation thus increases government con-
sumption without impacting government revenue, ex-penditure or the fi  scal balance.General government fiscal ratios*

years. A slight surplus is still recorded for 
2013.13
Government revenue and expenditure are 
now recorded as being higher, and the structure is changing. Along with the as-pects already addressed – the modifi  ed 
booking of research and development and 
military weapon systems and the upward revision of imputed social contributions – 
additional factors play a role. Thus, for ex-
ample, the turnover tax receipts transferred 
to the EU (the EU’s share of VAT) are no longer booked directly as EU revenue in 
Germany, but are now channelled explicitly 
through the German government budget. To this end, they are recorded under Ger-
man turnover tax receipts and at the same 
time booked on the expenditure side as a 
German transfer to the EU. In addition, the 
government sector tends to be more 
broadly defi  ned in ESA 2010, with more en-tities allocated to it than previously (eg the Helmholtz Association of German Research 
Centres). However, irrespective of the ele-vated recording of government revenue and expenditure, the much discussed ag-
gregated government revenue and expend-
iture ratios are somewhat smaller than under the previous calculation method 
owing to the increase in nominal GDP .
The Maastricht debt level will not be revised 
until the autumn notifi  cation. It will be in-
creased by the changed defi  nition of the 
government sector if debt of newly in-cluded entities is incurred vis- à- vis non- government creditors and is not offset by 
claims of the entities newly included in the 
government sector on other government 
entities. Overall, a downward correction of 
the debt ratio is to be expected owing to 
the signifi  cantly higher nominal GDP in the 
ratio’s denominator, which per se reduces the 2013 ratio by around 2 percentage 
points.For the purpose of evaluating fi  scal policy, it should be borne in mind that the level cor-
rections of a number of central GDP ratios 
are affected signifi  cantly by the modifi  ed treatment of research and development 
and military weapon systems in the national 
accounts. Overall, aggregate output meas-
ured using GDP has a higher value as not only current expenditure on the procure-
ment of weapons and R&D but also the re-lated depreciations expand GDP . Yet despite the now signifi  cantly more positive effect of such expenditure on GDP , its utility remains 
unchanged. By the same vein, the lower 
levy ratio cannot be seen as evidence that 
the burden of taxes and social contributions 
is lighter.14 Looking at government activity 
over time, there is likewise no fundamental 
reappraisal. With regard to international 
comparisons, the impact of the revisions of 
national accounts in other countries must fi  rst be awaited.
15 However, the upward 
corrections of nominal GDP per se do make 
compliance with EU budget rules some-what easier where these set numerical upper limits for the (structural) defi  cit and 
debt ratios.
13 The Maastricht defi  cit that governs compliance 
with EU rules will again equate to the defi  cit as shown 
in the national accounts starting with the notifi  cation 
in autumn 2014. For a time it deviated conceptually 
from the national account defi  cit as the Maastricht defi  cit included derivative payments from swaps und 
forward rate agreements treated as interest fl  ows. The 
deviation was largely insignifi  cant for Germany in 
quantitative terms.
14 If, for example, taxes and social contributions are 
related to national income, the statistical changeover 
actually leads to a marked increase in the ratio, since 
the major revision had a relatively small impact on na-
tional income whereas taxes and social contributions 
were revised upwards.
15 The EU countries have to switch over to the new 
ESA 2010 standard by autumn at the latest. Eurostat 
will provide information on the revisions of defi  cits and debt levels together with the usual publication on the Maastricht notifi  cations in October.Deutsche Bundesbank

ment barometer and the Federal Employment 
Agency’s BA-  X job index, a continuation of the 
positive trend in employment can be expected.
In seasonally adjusted terms, the official un -
employment figure showed hardly any change 
in August compared with July. The unemploy -
ment rate remained at 6.7%. Unemployment 
was down by 44,000 persons compared with 
the previous year. Seasonally adjusted under -
employment, which also includes persons tak -
ing part in labour market policy measures (ex -
cluding short- time work), likewise remained at 
the same level as in the previous month. Ac -
cording to the Institute for Employment Re -
search (IAB) labour market barometer, un -
employment is likely to be at a largely un -
changed level over the coming months.
Prices
There was a marked fall in the price of a barrel 
of Brent crude oil during August. On average, 
prices in August were 4½% down on the 
month. Crude oil prices fell further in the first 
half of September. As this report went to press, 
the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$97¾. The discount on crude oil futures was 
US$2¼ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$2¾ for purchases 12 months ahead.
After seasonal adjustment, import prices in July 
showed a marked month- on- month fall. Indus-
trial producer prices went down only slightly, 
however, and remained unchanged in August. Energy prices moderated, while prices of other goods accelerated somewhat. There was a dis-tinct rise in annual inflation to 1.7% in the case of import prices, while the figure for industrial producer prices went up marginally to 0.8%.
Consumer prices in August showed a further 
slight month- on- month rise (0.1%) in seasonally 
adjusted terms. Energy prices fell and food prices remained largely unchanged. Prices of industrial goods and services increased, how
-
ever. Housing rents were also going up at a slightly faster pace. As in July, the annual rate 
of inflation stood at 0.8% as measured by both 
the national consumer price index (CPI) and the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
Following a virtually balanced result one year 
previously, the statutory health insurance scheme recorded a deficit of €2 billion in the 
second quarter of 2014. The health insurance 
fund accounted for three- quarters of this sig -
nificant financial deterioration, while the re -
maining one- quarter was attributable to the 
statutory health insurance institutions. One of 
the main reasons for this negative development was the fact that the planned cut in the central government grant to the health insurance fund from €14 billion to €10½ billion did not come 
into effect until part way through 2014. Fol -
lowing the transfer of €3½ billion to the health 
insurance fund in the first quarter, which 
equated to one- quarter of the then €14 billion 
grant pursuant to legislation in force at that 
time, the amount for the second quarter was 
reduced to just over €1½ billion (a decrease of 
just over €1 billion in year- on- year terms) so 
that half of the reduced annual amount of €10½ billion would be transferred in the first 
half of 2014. In mid-2014, the statutory health 
insurance institutions’ reserves amounted to 
just over €16 billion, while the health insurance fund’s financial reserves totalled €10½ billion.
The statutory health insurance institutions’ rev-
enue rose by almost 4½%. As planned, the in-

ous year’s figure by 4%.2 However, the institu-
tions’ expenditure rose even more sharply with 
an increase of just over 5½%. Spending on 
pharmaceuticals, which was up by 10%, con -
tributed in particular to the rise in expenditure, 
after the manufacturers’ discount on patented pharmaceuticals was scaled back at the turn of the year. This was accompanied by a dispropor -
tionate rise in spending on therapeutic treat -
ment and aids (just over 9%), as well as on 
sickness benefit (7½%). By contrast, the growth rate in the hospital sector weakened slightly, al-
though it still stood at just over 4%. Premium 
repayments made by individual insurers to their members were already back down on the year.
The health insurance fund recorded a 3½% in-
crease in contributions, which reflects ongoing 
favourable employment and wage develop -
ments. However, fund receipts in the second quarter only saw an overall increase of just 
under 1% following cuts in the central govern-
ment grant. By contrast, the predefined trans -fers to the statutory health insurance institu -
tions rose by 4%.
The health insurance fund’s deficit widened by 
almost €1½ billion to reach just over €3 billion in the first half of 2014, of which €½ billion is 
attributable to the cut in the central govern -
ment grant. Although a surplus is expected at 
the end of the year owing to the usual final-  
quarter bonuses, it appears likely that a marked deficit will be recorded for the year as a whole. With a deficit of just over €½ billion in the first half of 2014, the statutory health insurance in-
stitutions’ finances deteriorated by just over 
€1½ billion in year- on- year terms. For the year 
as a whole, expenditure is also likely to increase 
considerably more rapidly than transfers from the health insurance fund, which means that 
last year’s surplus of just over €1 billion could 
well be followed by a deficit. The faster rise in 
expenditure vis-  à- vis income subject to com -
pulsory insurance contributions is set to con -
tinue unabated. This would lead to the cur -
rently still high reserves of the statutory health 
insurance institutions being rapidly depleted, which would make it necessary for individual statutory health insurance institutions to de
-
mand higher additional contributions in future.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
In the second quarter of 2014, the public long- 
term care insurance scheme recorded a slight 
surplus that was only marginally down on the 
year. Employees’ contributions rose by 3½%, 
whereas payments for pensioners saw a mere 
1% increase. Overall, revenue went up by al -
most 3%, while expenditure grew by just over 
3½%. Following the benefit increases intro -

fits, expenditure levels have now tailed off 
again. The reserves amounted to just over €6 
billion in mid-2014. In particular, the higher 
pension increase and additional pension ex -
penditure resulting from the expansion of benefits for child- rearing periods are likely to 
push up contribution receipts in the second 
half of the year and lead to a surplus for 2014 as a whole.
The draft of the Fifth Act Amending the Elev -
enth Book of the Social Security Code (Fünftes 
SGB XI- Änderungsgesetz) initiated a further 
long- term care reform. The contribution rate is 
to be raised from 2.05% to 2.35% (plus an 
extra 0.25% in each case for childless persons) effective from 1 January 2015. This should gen-
erate additional receipts of just over €3½ bil -
lion, two- thirds of which are earmarked for 
higher expenditure, while the remaining third is 
to be used to set up a separate reserve. Add -
itional expenditure is partly due to general regulation governing the dynamic adjustment 
of benefit rates, which was already enshrined 
in law in mid-2008.3 Furthermore, expenditure 
is set to rise as a result of existing long- term 
care guidelines being rendered more flexible, a 
step which primarily aims to take better ac -
count of the long- term care needs of persons 
suffering from dementia.
Additional receipts equivalent to one- tenth of a 
percentage point of the contribution rate are 
to be paid into a precautionary fund adminis-
tered by the Bundesbank. The aim of this is to 
build up capital stock over a period of 20 years 
through to the end of 2034. Taken by itself, building up the fund will lead to annual sur
-
pluses in the public long- term care insurance 
scheme; these are likely to amount to just over 
€1 billion in 2015. From 2035, a maximum of 
one- twentieth of the fund volume available at 
that point in time is to be used each year to limit the anticipated rise in the contribution 
rate. If financial resources are used in the man-ner currently intended by legislators, the contri-bution rate could be kept around one- tenth of a percentage point lower during the depletion phase.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €118.4 billion, gross issuance in the German bond market in July 2014 was up on the value of the previous month (€99.1 billion). However, 
following an increase in redemptions (€126.3 
billion) and taking into account the changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the out-
standing volume of domestic bonds recorded a 
net decline of €3.0 billion after having already Planned long-

3 According to this regulation, the need for a benefit rate adjustment must be reviewed every three years from 2015. 
The adjustment is based on price developments over the 
past three years, but it must not exceed the growth rate of total gross wages and salaries in the same period. A gen-
eral increase of 4% (or 2.7% in the case of benefits that 
were introduced for the first time in 2013) is planned for 
2015.Deutsche Bundesbank

contracted by €5.8 billion in June. By contrast, 
foreign instruments worth €3.0 billion were 
placed in the German market (compared with 
€7.5 billion the previous month), which meant 
that the outstanding volume of domestic and 
foreign debt instruments in Germany remained 
virtually unchanged.
The public sector redeemed own bonds total -
ling €5.8 billion net in the reporting month. 
Central government accounted for the greatest 
reduction in the public sector’s capital market 
debt on balance (€15.0 billion). The main focus 
was on redeeming ten- year Federal bonds 
(€20.8 billion). This was balanced by net issu -
ances of mainly two-  year Federal Treasury 
notes and five- year Federal notes (€3.8 billion 
and €3.6 billion respectively). The federal states issued bonds worth €9.3 billion net.
Domestic credit institutions redeemed own 
bonds worth €2.2 billion net in July. These in -
cluded other bank debt securities that can be structured flexibly (€1.2 billion) as well as mort-
gage Pfandbriefe and public Pfandbriefe (€1.2 
billion and €0.9 billion respectively). This was offset by net issuances of debt securities by specialised credit institutions (which include public promotional banks) in the amount of 
€1.1 billion.
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises issued debt securities worth €5.1 billion 
net. On balance, this is attributable exclusively 
to non- financial corporations (€5.2 billion) issu-
ing long- term bonds with maturities of over 
one year (€5.4 billion).
In July, domestic non- banks were the sole pur -
chasers, obtaining debt securities with a net 
worth of €7.8 billion. Foreign paper was slightly 
favoured (€4.3 billion). By contrast, non-  
residents scaled back their investments in the 
German bond market by €6.2 billion. German 
credit institutions contributed only marginally 
to market activity overall.
Equity market
In the reporting month, new shares totalling 
€1.8 billion net were issued in the German equity market, the bulk of which was ac
-
counted for by non- listed enterprises. The out-
standing volume of foreign shares rose by €1.5 
billion in the same period. Residents were the 
main purchasers, adding shares worth €6.7 bil-lion net to their portfolios. Domestic non- banks 
and credit institutions roughly balanced each 
other out (€3.5 billion and €3.2 billion respect-ively). Non- resident investors sold equity instru-
ments worth €3.3 billion net.
Mutual funds
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of €8.6 billion. Most of this money accrued to 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€7.2 billion). Among the asset classes it was mixed securities- based funds (€4.4 billion), Decline in the

benefited the most. Foreign mutual funds sold 
shares worth €4.4 billion net in the German 
market. On balance, domestic non- banks were 
virtually the only purchasers of mutual fund 
shares in the reporting month (€12.9 billion). Domestic credit institutions, too, purchased 
shares for €0.5 billion net, while foreign invest-
ors sold investment fund certificates for €0.4 
billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €21.7 billion in July 2014. This was €4.5 
billion up on the June level. The increase re -
sulted from the greatly expanded surplus in the goods account. The deficit on invisible current transactions, which comprise services as well as 
primary and secondary income, widened 
slightly.
The increased surplus in the goods account was primarily due to the larger foreign trade 
surplus which, according to the provisional cal-
culations of the Federal Statistical Office, ex -
panded by €6.8 billion to stand at €23.4 bil -
lion. In this context, exports rose considerably 
more sharply than imports.
In July, the deficit on invisible current transac -
tions went up by €1.5 billion on the month to 
€3.0 billion. While net receipts in the primary 
income balance rose by €1.2 billion to €5.9 bil-lion, mainly on account of lower dividend pay-
ments to non- residents, there was a larger in-
crease in the deficit on services, which widened 
by €1.8 billion to €5.9 billion. This was chiefly 
attributable to higher travel expenditure, which 
is typical for this time of year, but also to signifi-
cantly reduced revenue from IT and other busi-
ness services. Moreover, the negative balance 
of secondary income grew by €0.8 billion to 
€3.0 billion, essentially as a result of diminished government revenue from current taxes on in-come and wealth.Current account

Fuelled by investors’ continuing search for 
yield, German cross- border portfolio invest -
ment generated net capital exports of €17.6 billion in July. Non- residents scaled back their 
investment in Germany by €9.9 billion, display-ing a particular lack of interest in German debt 
securities, purchases of which were down by €6.2 billion. To an extent, these investors switched their investment focus from bonds and notes (€12.3 billion) to money market 
paper (€6.2 billion). Foreign market participants also sold German shares worth €3.4 billion. On 
the other hand, German investors boosted 
their holdings of foreign securities to the tune 
of €7.7 billion, mainly adding mutual fund 
shares (€4.4 billion) and debt securities issued 
by non- residents (€3.0 billion) to their port -
folios.
As with cross- border portfolio investment, dir -
ect investment generated net capital exports (€7.8 billion) in July, mainly because non-  
resident firms opted to withdraw €4.4 billion in 
funding from their affiliates in Germany. This 
owed much to the fact that foreign subsidiaries 
repaid short- term intra- group loans totalling 
€5.3 billion to their German parent companies. German enterprises likewise exported capital in 
net terms. They expanded their direct invest -
ment abroad by €3.3 billion, focusing exclu -
sively on bolstering their equity stakes (€4.9 
billion) while reducing their intra- group lending 
(mainly trade credits) by €1.5 billion.
Other statistically recorded investment – com -
prising loans and trade credits (where these do 
not constitute direct investment), bank deposits 
and other assets – saw net capital imports in 
July (€10.5 billion). These stemmed from the activities of enterprises and households, who 
reduced their claims by a net total of €17.1 bil-
lion. General government also saw outflows of 
funds (€1.0 billion). By contrast, the Bundes -
bank’s net external position increased by €7.8 
billion. The TARGET2 balance per se lowered 
the Bundesbank’s asset position (by €18.3 bil -
lion). However, as an even larger volume of 
short- term deposits was withdrawn, predomin-
antly by central banks domiciled outside the 
Eurosystem, the Bundesbank’s liabilities shrank 
to an even greater extent.

Ownership structure in the German  
equity market: general trends and changes in the financial crisis
The bulk of German equities are held by non- residents. The share of domestic stocks in foreign 
ownership declined during the financial crisis, with the heightened uncertainty and substantial 
liquidity needs prompting many investors worldwide to repatriate their assets, before going back 
up again in recent years; at last count, it stood at nearly 60%. The cross- border activity of invest -
ors, predominantly in the institutional segment, and the significant investment flows they can 
generate, are probably the main reasons for the substantial share of foreign ownership. The per-centage of foreign ownership in the flagship index DAX is even greater. This is probably due to 
the high profile of its constituent enterprises, not to mention the comprehensive analyst and 
media coverage it receives, which ensures that information on the DAX is just as readily available for investors outside Germany. DAX securities are, moreover, highly liquid.
In the domestic segment, institutional investors are by far the largest group of investors, and their 
share has remained largely static over time, although a shift has taken place within this sector. By and large, banks and financial investors have tapered their investment in German equities over 
the course of the crisis, probably primarily in response to tighter regulatory requirements. They 
have been replaced by non- financial institutional investors such as holding companies, which 
have enlarged their stakes in resident listed enterprises. There exists a preference for larger Ger-man enterprises, especially among domestic financial investors. Private investors appear to prefer investments in smaller, local public limited companies.Deutsche Bundesbank

Development and structure 
of the German equity market
Of the roughly 3.7 million enterprises in Ger -
many in 2012, just over 11,000 were public 
limited companies (Aktiengesellschaften or 
Kommanditgesellschaften auf Aktien). These public limited companies account for roughly 18% of aggregate revenues and employ just 
under 9% of employees subject to social secur -
ity contributions.1 Just a fraction of Germany’s 
public limited companies are listed on a stock 
exchange. At the end of July 2014, shares of 
711 enterprises were trading at the major trad-
ing venues of Deutsche Börse AG, and they had a market capitalisation of around €1,200 billion. In market capitalisation terms, this makes the German stock market the seventh 
largest worldwide and number three in Europe 
after the United Kingdom and France.2 How -
ever, Germany’s equity market capitalisation to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio is relatively 
meagre by international standards, at a long-  
run average of 40%, which is less than the fig-ure for the euro- area countries (50%) and well 
below that of the Anglo-  Saxon markets (United 
States: 111%; United Kingdom: 135%).

Since 1988 the value of German equities, as 
measured by the DAX, has grown more than ten- fold in three major cycles, which are also reflected in issuance activity (see the box on 
pages 21 and 22). All in all, enterprises in Ger -
many have issued new shares with a market 
value of €296 billion since 1988. The Bundes -
bank’s capital market statistics (see the chart below) reveal that issuing activity expanded 
strongly in the 1990s on the back of the New 
Economy boom before contracting sharply on 
account of hefty equity price losses in the years 
leading up to 2002, putting a damper on de -
mand and curtailing the funding options avail-able to enterprises. Annual issuance levelled off at less than €10 billion until the outbreak of the 
financial crisis in 2008, during the course of 
which issuance activity went back up, even 
though public offerings were virtually non-  
existent. This period was dominated by recapi-
talisations among financial institutions which, 
in some cases, saw governments subscribing all 
the shares issued in private placements. Initial 
public offerings only made something of a 
comeback beginning in 2012.

The Securities Holdings Statistics (WPInvest), 
which the Bundesbank began collecting at the 
end of 2005, can be used to shed more light 
on the ownership structure of German equities. 
WPInvest captures both the reporting institu -

German share price developments
 The German s hare price index, the DAX, is 
an important indicator for the German 
stock market. It is calculated by Deutsche Börse and tracks the share price develop-ments of the 30 largest German public limited companies which are admitted to trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
1 
The DAX is primarily calculated as a per-
formance index and therefore also incorp-
orates – unlike a price index – the accumu-lated distributions of the index constituents. 
In July 2014, the enterprises listed in the 
DAX index accounted for 64% of the stock capital admitted to trading in Germany with a market capitalisation of €776 billion. The 
index plays an important role as a bench-
mark for fi  nancial instruments (such as fu-
tures and options, but also index funds and 
certifi  cates) both for institutional and pri-
vate investors and is often referred to as the fl  agship index of the German stock market.
Between 1988 and the end of August 2014, 
the value of German shares, as measured 
by the DAX, has increased almost tenfold on the whole. Share price developments 
alone were responsible for just over half of 
the overall rise in the DAX index. The per-
formance of the index follows a similar pat-
tern to that of the enterprises’ expected 
earnings 12 months ahead, which, just like the discount factors, are a fundamental de-terminant of equity price developments (see the chart on page 22).
2 Occasionally, how-
ever, there are differences in the develop-ment of share prices and expected earn-
ings, which is refl  ected in the time- varying 
ratio of these variables, the price- earnings 
ratio (P/E ratio) (see the chart on page 22).3
On the whole, three major stock price 
cycles can be distinguished. The DAX index rose during the 1990s and into the second 
quarter of the year 2000, peaking at what 
was then a new all- time high of just over 
8,000 index points. This trend was primarily driven by shares in the telecommunications, media and technology (TMT) industries, the 
profi  t potential of which is dependent on market developments in the more distant 
future. During this period, share prices out-paced expected earnings 12 months ahead, pushing the P/E ratio to values in excess of 
20 over a number of years. The high valu-
ation of the DAX was therefore also a re-fl  ection of the exceptionally optimistic ex-
pectations for medium and long- term profi  t 
growth rates in technology- intensive sec-
tors, which were ultimately disappointed.
The marked slump experienced by high technology “New Economy” stocks after March 2000 also weighed on the DAX, which had fallen to one- third of its peak 
level by the second quarter of 2003. How-
ever, given that the expected earnings 12 
months ahead declined only around half as strongly, the P/E ratio dropped considerably during this period. The DAX increased again signifi  cantly in the course of the global eco-nomic recovery, reaching a new peak fi  gure 
1 All the index members have to be listed in Deutsche 
Börse AG’s Prime Standard segment. The largest enter-prises measured by stock exchange turnover and mar-
ket capitalisation are admitted to the DAX index. It is 
not the overall market capitalisation which is decisive, but the market capitalisation of the shares in free fl  oat. Stocks held by shareholders with a stake of over 5% in the share capital are therefore not taken into consider-ation.
2 Long- term profi  ts are diffi   cult to predict, which is 
why, in practice, the expected earnings 12 months 
ahead – determined on the basis of surveys – are often used instead for the sake of simplicity.
3 The actual payments made to shareholders are 
known as dividends. The payment of dividends is, 
however, subject to a dividend payment policy, which is, not least, infl  uenced by certain legal provisions. Fol-lowing an amendment in 1998 that made it easier for enterprises to repurchase their own shares, which also offered a tax advantage, share buybacks increased sig-
nifi  cantly and even replaced dividend payments. It 
would be wrong, therefore, to interpret the decline in 
the dividend- price ratio as a price increase, which is why the following evaluation concentrates on the 
profi  t as a payment, and the P/E ratio is used instead of the  dividend-price ratio. Expected profi  ts are based on a 12-month horizon.Deutsche Bundesbank

of over 8,100 index points in the summer of 
2007. Quotations and earnings expect-
ations rose virtually in tandem during this 
period, and the P/E ratio contracted slightly 
despite an upward movement in share 
prices.
The fi  nancial market shock emanating from 
the US real estate market and the attendant 
fears about the soundness of a number of 
fi  nancial institutions weighed heavily on share prices and profi  t expectations, and 
did not leave DAX stocks unscathed. It also 
became apparent as the crisis progressed that disruptions in the fi  nancial markets were increasingly spilling over to the real 
economy, which would trigger a very severe 
downturn in the global economy. Share 
prices bottomed out in the second quarter 
of 2009. The ensuing recovery began with 
the expectation that the recession would 
come to an end in the major advanced and 
emerging market economies. Analysts 
began revising their profi  t expectations up-wards again as a result of the increasingly 
positive economic data. Furthermore, share prices were shored up by the extremely ac-commodative monetary policy.
The escalation of the European sovereign 
debt crisis in the second half of 2011 only 
briefl  y interrupted this upward trend. The persistent low- interest- rate policies of all major central banks and a widespread 
search for yield sent the DAX to new record 
levels in July 2014, and the P/E ratio in-
creased from a low level.4 The heightened 
geopolitical tensions as well as – in a prob-
ably related development – some weaker- 
than- expected business indicators recently, 
notably for the euro area, subsequently 
dragged down stock prices.
4 The price index excluding reinvested dividends is 
around one- fi  fth down on the historical high it reached 
in March 2000 during the New Economy boom.Share prices, expected profits and price-earnings ratio of the DAX

in keeping with the reporting template (see the 
table on page  24). The WPInvest data thus 
allow the ownership structure of listed German 
public limited companies to be analysed in de-tail. Only account- keeping financial institutions 
domiciled in Germany are required to report se-curities holdings. Just under 5% of the German market capitalisation is held in custody outside 
Germany, which means that it is not captured 
by WPInvest. This share is assigned in full to non- resident investors for the purpose of this 
article. The stock data for residents thus repre-
sent a minimum level of holdings, since Ger -
man equities held abroad by German residents 
are assigned to the non- resident share.
It might appear surprising, initially, that the 
bulk of German equities held by non- residents 
are also reported in WPInvest, even though 
only domestic account- keeping institutions are 
required to report their holdings.5 One possible 
explanation for this is that non- resident invest-
ors are just as keen to seek out the main trad-
ing venue of an equity they wish to purchase 
because that is normally where the security is 
guaranteed to be at its most liquid. Another 
possibility is that settlement and safe custody in 
the country of issue are still more cost- effective 
than transferring securities to the securities de-posit account holder’s home country.
6
Non- resident holdings
More than half of the market capitalisation of 
German public limited companies (57.1%) was 
in foreign ownership at last count (see the 
table on page 24). The foreign ownership share 
was once even a tick higher – at the end of 
2007 – before receding to 51.6% in the wake 
of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This was a 
spell in which investors around the world re -
patriated their assets. But the longer- term trend 
towards cross- border investment regained the 
upper hand relatively quickly, pushing the share 
of German equities in foreign ownership back 
up.However, the options offered by WPInvest for 
researching the structure of non- resident de -
positors in greater detail are limited. Only around 10% of foreign holdings are held dir
-
ectly by non- resident households, financial and 
non- financial institutional investors with report-
ing domestic banks or central securities deposi-tories. The remainder of the foreign ownership 
share is held in custody by foreign central se -
curities depositories and banks with reporting 
domestic account- keeping institutions. The re -
ported data cannot be drilled down further to distinguish between proprietary and third- party 
holdings, as with the data for domestic invest-
ors. Yet it can be plausibly assumed that the 
non- resident investors are almost entirely insti-
tutional investors.7
Ownership structure  
of domestic depositors
The domestic share of German public limited 
companies’ market capitalisation at the end of 
May 2014 amounted to 42.9%, meaning that it 
has diminished slightly, by 2.6 percentage 
points, in recent years, albeit amid some fluctu-
ation during the financial crisis (see the table on page 24). At last count, domestic institu
-
tional investors as a whole held just under a third of all German equities (29.4%), with 18.3 percentage points being attributable to non- financial investors and 11.1 percentage 
points to financial investors. Non- financial in
-
vestors include all enterprises which predomin-antly produce goods and non- financial services 
as well as holding companies which hold stakes 
in other non- financial corporations. Domestic 
mutual funds held 6.3% at last count, making Possible explan-

the efficiency of cross- border settlement in the European 
securities markets to the next level.7 See, for example, M Dahlquist and G Robertsson (2001),

them the most important group of owners in 
Germany’s financial sector, followed by domes-
tic banks (2.7%) and other financial institutions 
(1.3%). Insurers – which, for the purposes of 
this classification, also include pension funds – held a relatively small fraction of German equi-ties as this report went to press (0.9%). House-
holds, meanwhile, held an 11.8% share at the 
end of May 2014.
The overall decline in the proportionate value 
held by residents observed since 2005 is largely 
the outcome of a drop in household equity holdings. The fractional value held by institu
-
tional investors, by contrast, has remained al -
most static over time. However, there was a shift within this sector towards non- financial 
investors.8
Determinants of investor 
 behaviour
Enterprise size
One possible determinant of the ownership 
structure of equities is the size of the public 
limited company. In this section, we therefore 
arrange the shares of German enterprises in 
order of market capitalisation and divide them into five groups with an equal number of enter -prises (quintiles) in an attempt to shed more light on the relationship between an enter
-
prise’s size and its appeal to individual investor groups (see the table on page 25). Comparing 
the first quintile (smallest firms) with the fifth (largest) reveals that, among large cap enter
-
prises, domestic institutional investors and non- resident owners, which are likewise predomin-
antly made up of institutional investors, grow 
in importance (by 15 and 17 percentage points 
respectively) as the size of the enterprise in -
creases. Institutional investors in Germany and 
abroad focus their investments primarily on 
large cap enterprises, whereas the shares held 
by domestic households shrink as enterprises grow in size. The quintile comparison shows that their fractional share diminishes steadily 
from 46.5% to 14.0%.
One reason why households are strongly over -
weighted in smaller caps might be their prefer -
ence for local firms. It can be shown for Ger -
many that private investors weight local enter -
prises much more heavily than they normally 
would, were they to assemble a portfolio diver -Households hold

8 The sharp growth visible in the non- financial sector 
 between 2007 and 2008 can mainly be explained by the 
exceptional movement shown by the Volkswagen AG com-

sified by market capitalisation.9 The outcome is 
not affected by holdings of staff shares which, 
owing to households’ usual proximity to the 
workplace, would also be assigned to the local 
equities category.10 Some papers in the relevant 
literature posit that informed (ie rational) in -
vestor choice is a possible explanation for 
households’ tendency to overweight local equi-
ties. They assume that local investors enjoy a positive information asymmetry in respect of 
local firms, which translates into excess returns 
on local shareholdings.11 However, the empir -
ical evidence for a positive information asym -
metry in respect of local equity investments is 
ambiguous, with a raft of other papers indicat-
ing that investors with a local bias do not 
achieve superior returns, or even that they sys-
tematically underperform.12 A corresponding 
study of German private investors likewise con-cludes that households do not generate signifi-
cant excess returns. Rather, the local bias in portfolios can be explained by a “flight to fa
-
miliarity” which does not translate into measur -
able superior returns.13 Familiarity appears to 
be a major factor in the composition of house-hold equity portfolios. This regionally bounded 
investor behaviour is particularly pronounced 
because, interestingly, it is a phenomenon that can also be observed across national borders.
14Domestic financial investors, by contrast, have 
a clear preference for larger cap enterprises. While the first to fourth size quintiles in the 
table above show a relatively modest rise in the 
percentage share, the fifth quintile jumps sig -
nificantly to 12.5%. This pattern is even more 
pronounced among non- resident investors, a 
group which likewise sees the ownership share rising in almost a linear fashion up to the fourth quintile before climbing sharply to 47.8% in the 
quintile containing the largest caps. This in -
crease is consistent with the existing research 
findings, which have identified less pronounced Bias towards

information asymmetries as the driving force 
behind non- resident investors’ bias towards 
larger German enterprises.15 Larger cap enter -
prises are normally the subject of relatively strong information flows, as reflected, for in
-
stance, by the broad coverage they enjoy from 
equity analysts. Moreover, evidence from the German market confirms that shares in large cap enterprises also tend to be increasingly 
held by mutual funds and other institutional in-
vestors, besides featuring regularly in the media. This reduces the likelihood of there 
being additional information about a particular enterprise that is more readily available for do-mestic investors than for foreign ones. What is more, large cap equities are more liquid, which 
is probably another major reason for their ap -
peal to non- resident investors.16
DAX membership
The preference of foreign investors for equities 
of large caps with low information asymmetry 
and high liquidity is particularly evident in the 
case of DAX enterprises, which are the 30 most 
important public limited companies in Ger -
many. In addition to the aforementioned factor of enterprise size, membership of a well- known 
national index is an additional incentive for for -
eign investors to invest in these enterprises.17 
Conversely, the greater presence and recogni -
tion of the DAX among the international public 
leads to a reduction in the perception of DAX 
enterprises as local enterprises, causing the 
previously observed overweighting of local en-
terprises to diminish significantly for this 
group.18
DAX enterprises, which account for nearly two- 
thirds of overall German stock market capital -
isation, will be examined in more detail in this section. This disaggregated analysis allows add-
itional insights into the investment behaviour 
of various investor groups to be gained.
According to the WPInvest classification, 63.7% 
of the market capitalisation of DAX enterprises 
is held by non- residents (see the table on page 27).19 The interest shown by foreign in -
vestors in DAX enterprises is therefore signifi -
cantly higher than their interest in the average enterprise located in the top size quintile.
The share of the DAX held by foreign investors 
has increased by 7.8 percentage points since 
2005. As the composition of the DAX changes 
regularly, this raises the question of whether 
this significant change is purely attributable to 
changes in the DAX’s composition. For ex -
ample, it is conceivable that enterprises that 
have exited the DAX since 2005 were primarily 
held in the portfolios of domestic investors, 
whereas the ownership structure of enterprises 
joining the DAX were dominated to a greater 
extent by foreign investors.20 A corresponding 
analysis shows that this, however, is not the 
case. If we take the current DAX members and 
factor in their ownership figures from 2005, 
this actually results in a slightly greater increase 
in the share held by foreign investors. The same change is seen if we only consider DAX enter -
prises that have been members of the DAX continuously since 2005. Compositional 
changes to the DAX can therefore be ruled out as a cause of the changed ownership structure. Indeed, foreign investors deliberately added to 
their DAX holdings. The relatively high current 
level of foreign ownership had, in fact, already been attained prior to the financial and sover -
eign debt crisis at the end of 2007. The share of 
DAX securities held by foreign investors then fell sharply following the collapse of Lehman Foreign investors 
show strong preference for DAX enterprisesShare of DAX held by foreign-ers on the rise since 2005

19 As already mentioned in the discussion on investor clas-
sifications, it must be noted that these figures represent an upper limit. For example, this measurement deems domes-tic market participants to be foreign if they happen to hold 
their portfolio abroad or manage it via a foreign central 
securities depository.20 An enterprise may be required to exit the DAX if its mar -
ket value and stock exchange trading volume relative to 
that of other enterprises drop sharply, or if it is involved in a merger or takeover.Deutsche Bundesbank

Brothers at the end of 2008, only to then 
quickly return to previous levels. The swift re -
covery of the German economy after the eco-
nomic downturn in 2008-09 and the high competitiveness of the largely internationally 
oriented DAX enterprises evidently made DAX 
equities attractive to foreign investors.
A region- based view shows that approximately 
one- third of German equities, as measured by 
market capitalisation, are held by EU residents. 
However, this figure also includes foreign cen-
tral securities depositories, whose holdings cannot be attributed with complete certainty to end- investors on a regional basis. It must 
also be taken into account that the EU figure 
includes holdings in London’s financial centre, 
and the data do not allow a distinction to be 
made between securities holdings of UK invest-ors and those of clients based in other parts of the world. At last count, the share held by US 
residents amounted to 16.5%, and here too –  similarly to London – the fact that various large mutual funds and other institutional  investors are domiciled there is likely to have 
had an impact on this figure. Investors in both 
the EU and the USA have increased their share 
of the DAX since the end of 2005. Approxi -
mately one- fifth of the DAX’s market capitalisa-
tion is held by investors from the euro area, 
with a particularly notable portion being attrib-utable to investors from Luxembourg, on ac -
count of its mutual fund industry, and France. 
Asia plays an almost negligible role as a direct investment location for DAX securities. Exclud-ing investor groups from the EU (including Ger -
many), Switzerland and the USA, the remaining share of DAX holdings attributable to residents 
of all other countries, including those in Asia, 
amounted to just 7.6% at the end of May 2014.
Past performance (momentum effect)The momentum effect means that shares which 
have shown above- average price gains in the 
past will continue to outperform past “losers”. 
This anomaly can also be shown to exist for the German equity market, the topic of this article (see the box on pages 29 to 31).
The question arises as to whether and to what 
extent the momentum effect has been system-
atically exploited by individual investor groups 
on the German equities market. A correspond-
ing analysis shows there is a strong positive 
correlation between the change in the share of foreign ownership and past cumulative returns, 
which could be an indication that foreign in -
vestors have been following a momentum 
strategy. It therefore follows that domestic in -
vestors, on aggregate, formed the anticyclical 
counterpart to this strategy. The breakdown of The largest inter-

investor groups shows that only households 
pursued this contrarian approach. By contrast, 
financial investors, including mutual funds and 
banks in particular, were among those who fol-lowed a momentum strategy.Preference for “safe” securities during the financial crisis
If one looks at equity holdings of domestic pri-
vate investors over a long period, large cyclical fluctuations become apparent.
21 Private invest-
ors’ holdings of direct equities were strongly influenced by share price developments (see 
the adjacent chart).22 For example, rising prices 
in the wake of the New Economy boom at the 
turn of the millennium and the sharp downturn 
that followed are reflected in the level of equity 
holdings. In the years that followed, equity 
holdings grew continuously, before once again 
experiencing a sharp downturn during the 
2008 financial crisis. The effect of price fluctu-ations on assets is amplified by the pro- cyclical 
purchasing and selling behaviour of investors, 
which seems to be particularly pronounced 
during crisis periods. Heavy selling occurred in 
2001-02 and 2008 on the back of sharp price falls. In 2008, for example, the equity holdings of private investors fell by a total of €188½ bil-
lion or nearly 51%, of which only €9½ billion (equivalent to 2.6% of equity holdings at the 
end of 2007) was attributable to net sales.
An analysis of private investors’ financial assets 
confirms that holdings of equities, mutual fund 
shares and other participating interests fell 
sharply as a percentage of total assets, particu-
larly in 2008 (see the adjacent chart). The fall 
was most pronounced for direct share hold -
ings, which subsequently represented just 4.2% of overall wealth, therefore marking a 
historic low.23 Since then, the share of equities Large fluctu-

Momentum strategy in the German equity market
In the momentum effect, shares whose 
prices rose faster than average in the past 
will continue to outperform past “losers”. 
First documented for the US equity market 
by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), this effect contradicts the effi   cient markets hypothesis, 
introduced by Fama (1970), which holds that past share price movements cannot 
predict current or future share prices.1 Un-
like other equity market anomalies, this 
phenomenon has been proven to exist even after it was fi  rst described, and it has been 
identifi  ed even outside the US equity mar-
ket and in other asset classes.2 Using quar-
terly data on the German equity market 
from end-2005 to end-2 012 obtained from the Securities Holdings Statistics (WPInvest), this box will investigate whether a momen-
tum effect can be found to exist for Ger-
man equities, too, as well as which groups 
of investors follow this strategy.3 WPInvest 
covers the German equity market nearly fully;  
its advantage over other data sets used for 
internationally comparable studies is that 
the trading strategies of various groups of 
investors can be analysed simultaneously. If a group of investors buys shares whose past 
returns were above average or sells shares 
with above- average losses, there has to be at least one other group of investors doing the exact opposite. WPInvest can therefore be used to identify not only momentum in-
vestors but also the group of trading part-
ners. The detailed reporting template also 
permits a more detailed breakdown of insti-tutional investors than has been the case in the international research literature.

Momentum strategy for German shares
The fi  rst step in this analysis is to arrange all 
German shares in order of return over a 
pre- defi  ned period – known as the “forma-tion period”.5 The highest- yielding 30% of 
shares are put into a winner portfolio and 
the lowest- yielding 30% into a loser port-
folio.6 The next step is then to create a port-
folio for which the shares in the winner 
portfolio are purchased at the same weights 
and those of the loser portfolio are short- 
sold at the same weights (zero- cost strat-
egy). Now the portfolio’s performance over 
a second period, the “holding period”, is  tracked.

the existence of momentum effects in international 
equity markets (the effect is weakest in Asia, especially in Japan). C S Asness, T J Moskowitz and L H Pedersen 
(2013), Value and momentum everywhere, Journal of 
Finance 68, pp 929-85, document the existence of the 
momentum effect not only in equities but in other 
asset classes as well.3 The results for the German equity market discussed 
in this box are based on the forthcoming Deutsche 
Bundesbank discussion paper by M Baltzer, S Jank and 
E Smajlbegovic, entitled “Who trades on momen-
tum?”.4 Institutional investors can be broken down into non- fi  nancial and fi  nancial investors, and fi  nancial investors 
can be broken down even further into banks, mutual 
funds, insurers and other fi  nancial investors. The data set of 13-F SEC fi  lings usually used in the US literature 
contains only the large institutional investors, which 
cannot be broken down any further.
5 A formation period usually lasts from one to four 
quarters. This investigation is based on a four- quarter 
period, although the results are robust to the length of the formation period.6 This classifi  cation is attributable to E F Fama and K R

(WML) strategy turns out to be highly prof-
itable for Germany, which is in line with re-sults for the United States and other coun-
tries. For Germany, this leads to an eco-
nomically and statistically signifi  cant annu-
alised difference between winner and loser portfolio returns of over 11%. Although the WML strategy proves profi  table on average 
across the observation period, there are also isolated quarters with heavy losses, 
particularly in the second and third quarters of 2009, when the markets were beginning to recover from the drastic collapses follow-
ing the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The reason for the losses is that, although the 
losers reacted particularly sensitively to the 
fi  nancial market shock, following the sub-siding of tensions, they subsequently re-
bounded more strongly than the winners.8
Different strategies pursued by individual groups of investors
The investigation in this box of the applica-
tion of the WML strategy in the German 
market by individual groups of investors be-
gins with a calculation, for every share i, of 
the percentage ownership share held 
 by investor group j at time t.
For the shares in the winner (loser) port-folio, the average quarterly change in the 
percentage share for each investor sector is calculated.
9 A positive (negative) difference 
in the change in the investor share between 
the winner and loser portfolios indicates that the group of investors is following a 
WML (“contrarian”) strategy.
To adjust for other potential effects, a panel 
data regression is run for each group of in-vestors which not only regresses the change in the ownership share 
 on the re-turns of the formation period ( ) 
but also controls for fi  rm- specifi  c variables  
(controls i,t−1):10
∆OS i,j,t=αt+β·ret i,(t−4,t−1)
+γ·controls i,t−1+εi,j,t
The results indicate a signifi  cant positive in-fl  uence on the foreign percentage share of returns achieved over the formation period; 
foreign investors are therefore pursuing a WML strategy, confi  rming existing re-search.
11 By construction, domestic invest-
ors, in the aggregate, accordingly consti-
tute the segment of “contrarian” investors. A sector- specifi  c look at domestic investors 
shows, however, that only households are 
pursuing a contrarian strategy, which is like-
wise consistent with the results of inter-national research for the United States.
12 
Domestic institutional investors, and par-
ticularly mutual funds, are likewise follow-
ing a WML strategy.13
8 This development is also visible in other markets; see 
K Daniel and T Moskowitz (2013), Momentum crashes, Swiss Finance Institute Working Paper.9 In order to adjust the demand for certain shares for 
possible general trends in equity market investment, for each investor sector the specifi  c demand for a 
share is corrected for average demand at that particu-lar time.
10 These fi  rm- specifi  c factors include size, book- to- 
market ratio, volatility, beta factor, age, dividend re-
turn, index membership and stock exchange turnover.

Possible explanatory approaches
There is contentious debate in the literature 
on the possible causes of the momentum 
effect. They centre on the question of 
whether the observed price movement is an underreaction or an overreaction. In favour 
of overreaction, Daniel et al (1998) argue 
that (institutional) investors are too sure of 
their own assessment of a share and, more-
over, tend to see new information as, in particular, confi  rming their decisions and assessments (overconfi  dence bias).
14 Suc-
cessful investment decisions are seen as re-
fl  ecting one’s own abilities, whereas the 
other decisions are put down to bad luck. If 
a share’s price is correctly forecast to rise, 
investors increase their positions in these in-
struments, causing their prices to rise and 
to become further removed from their fun-
damental values. Negative information, by 
contrast, initially does not impact on behav-
iour, which accordingly leads to a positive 
momentum effect.
Whereas the overconfi  dence hypothesis is 
chiefl  y associated with momentum traders, Grinblatt and Han (2005) focus on the “dis-position effect” among counterparty invest-ors who are slow to respond to new funda-
mental data and therefore “underreact”.15 
Investors hold their losers too long while 
selling their winners too quickly. What this 
means is that good news about a share causes only a gradual adjustment to the 
new (higher) fundamental value.
By interacting heterogeneous investor groups, the approach postulated by Hong 
and Stein (1999) unifi  es underreaction and 
overreaction. One group, the “newswatch-
ers”, acts upon fundamental information, only gradually processing news. The other group, “momentum traders”, observes 
leading price indicators and enters the mar-
ket as prices are rising, thus achieving a new fundamental value. However, the mo-
mentum traders do not know this funda-
mental value, and will thus continue to in-
vest owing to persistent positive price sig-nals, causing the share price to overheat. 
Negative reports about the enterprise lead 
to similar effects.
On balance, the existence of a disposition 
effect for households, which enables insti-
tutional and foreign investors to pursue a profi  table WML strategy, can be regarded 
as being consistent with the analysed data 
set. What the data also show, however, is 
that, particularly in times of uncertainty, a 
momentum strategy can yield heavy losses. 
Within this explanatory approach, this 
would be the case if the share prices were 
initially to overreact, owing to increased 
price pressure from momentum traders, fol-lowed by subsequent corrections.

as a proportion of total assets has increased 
continuously, but two- thirds of this increase is 
attributable to rising prices. At the end of 2013, 
equities accounted for 5.8% of total assets. Pri-
vate investors obviously restructured their 
assets at the peak of the financial crisis, switch-ing out of equities and into other, less risky in-vestments.
A look at changes in holdings of domestic equi-
ties using the detailed data from WPInvest pro-
vides a more nuanced picture for households. 
On the one hand, it confirms that the propor -
tion of households’ total assets held in port -
folios (as measured by the market capitalisation 
of all domestic stocks) declined steadily from 
13.3% to 10.0% between 2005 and 2007 (see the table on page 24). However, it also shows that this proportion increased slightly to 10.3% 
in the crisis year of 2008. Interestingly, this 
change is attributable solely to DAX securities, 
which experienced a relatively significant rise from 10.6% to 11.5% (see the table on 
page 27).
The investment behaviour of households dur -
ing the financial crisis shows that they not only 
switched investments from one asset class to 
another, but also took a nuanced approach to investments within the same asset class. While selling off foreign equities, they also made net 
purchases of domestic securities. A decisive 
role here is likely to have been played by invest-ors’ familiarity with large domestic enterprises, 
familiarity being of particular relevance during 
crises.24 A decline in risk appetite (or an in -
crease in risk aversion) may also have been a 
key factor in causing equity investments to be 
repatriated in the short run.25Conclusion
More than half of the market capitalisation of German equities is held abroad, which can be seen as a manifestation of increasing inter
-
national interconnectedness. Even though a sig -
nificant fall in foreign holdings of German equi -
ties was observed in connection with the col -
lapse of Lehman Brothers, the trend towards 
cross- border securities investments rebounded 
relatively quickly. In general, banks and financial 
investors reduced their investment in German 
equities over the course of the crisis, with non-  
financial institutional investors such as holding companies stepping in to fill the gap. House
-
holds account for just over 12% of domestic 
market capitalisation. It is apparent that large en -
terprises are the preferred choice of foreigners 
and financial investors, while smaller enterprises, 
by contrast, are held primarily by households. It 
is also possible to identify different trading strat -
egies among different investor groups. While 
foreign investors and, above all, mutual funds pursue a momentum strategy, households take 
the opposite approach. Moreover, it appears that company familiarity plays a role in equity invest
-
ments, particularly for households. For example, 
during the financial crisis, private investors not 
only switched investments from one asset class 
(equities) to another (bonds), but also slightly in -
creased their holdings of DAX securities.… but an

The reform of financial relations  
in the German federal system
German fiscal policymakers face the challenge of reforming the complex system of financial allo-
cation within the various levels of government by 2020. The existing federal financial equalisation system, including the special transfers for the states in eastern Germany, will expire in 2019. On 
the one hand, the reform must give due consideration to the fact that budgetary autonomy 
involves the federal states bearing responsibility for their own affairs. On the other hand, the Ger-man constitution (Basic Law, or Grundgesetz) prescribes a reasonable equalisation of differences in the financial capacity of the federal states.
The federal states are also obliged to implement the debt brake by 2020; this is designed to stop 
or prevent excessive borrowing by individual federal states. The existing regulations, which involve soft debt limits and de facto implicit debt guarantees between the different tiers of government, have not proven effective. Some federal states are still facing considerable challenges in achieving a (structurally) balanced budget by 2020 and thereafter.
Given the strict borrowing rules and the principle of individual fiscal responsibility, the obvious 
thing to do – in addition to the federal states’ already increased discretionary scope on the 
expenditure side – would be to increase their tax autonomy, say, by means of individual limited surcharges and deductions for specific types of tax. In this way, greater consideration could also be given to varying preferences, and awareness of the link between taxes and spending could be strengthened. This could result in government activity becoming more cost- effective and targeted. 
Various forms of assistance from the German state as a whole are occasionally suggested to 
make the transition easier for federal states with a very difficult budgetary situation. If such assis-tance were to be introduced, it should be made conditional on strict implementation of the debt brake. It will ultimately be the task of elected politicians to decide on the desired level of equal-isation in the financial equalisation system. In view of the cost differences and the federal states’ own incentives to strengthen their financial capacity, it would seem worthwhile to consider redu-
cing the level of equalisation. If the level of equalisation is largely maintained, a central tax 
administration might help to limit negative incentives in the collection of taxes. In any event, it 
would appear desirable to put the financial equalisation system on a more transparent and 
understandable footing.Deutsche Bundesbank

Basic principles of  financial 
relations in the  German 
 federal system
Germany has a federal system in which govern-
ment tasks are divided between several levels. 
In this system, central government and the fed-
eral states are entitled to decide on their own 
budgets (Article 109 of the German constitu -
tion), whilst also having to adhere to a number 
of jointly agreed principles. However, the indi -
vidual federal states can regulate the details of 
their local authorities’ budget management 
and can even reserve the right to approve 
budgets.
In terms of budget expenditure, central govern-
ment’s key responsibilities are compulsory so -
cial security, labour market policy and defence. 
The majority of the federal states’ expenditure 
centres around education (including research), 
internal security, justice and administrative ac -
tivities (including tax administration). The main 
expenditure items for local authorities are so -
cial benefits (including assistance for young people and childcare for infants), funding for culture, sport and recreation as well as local service provision and waste disposal services 
(including infrastructure investment).
As a rule, the various levels of government are 
responsible for funding the tasks they perform (Article 104a of the German constitution), even if a different level is responsible for their legisla-
tion. In practice, a large degree of legislative 
power is based with central government, while 
the federal states can mostly have a coordin -
ated influence via the Bundesrat. The constitu-
tional aim of broadly equal living standards 
within Germany also plays a role in shaping the 
federal financial relations, which links in with the distribution of responsibilities. Moreover, 
following a ruling by Germany’s Federal Consti-
tutional Court, the German constitution also 
contains the principle of common responsibility for the federation, which involves an obligation 
to provide financial assistance in cases of ex -treme budgetary hardship and therefore elem-ents of joint liability.
Budgets are mainly financed through taxation. 
The largest contribution is made by joint taxes 
(turnover, income and corporation tax), which 
are accrued at several tiers of government. In 
addition to this, there are taxes at the central 
government level (most notably special excise 
taxes and the solidarity surcharge), as well as a 
number of state-  level taxes (especially real 
 estate acquisition tax and inheritance tax) 
– which, however, yield far less revenue – as 
well as local government taxes (especially local 
business tax and real property taxes). Joint taxes are generally distributed between the 
tiers of government according to fixed quotas, 
while, pursuant to the German constitution, the distribution of turnover tax is a means of ensuring that central and state governments can cover their necessary expenditures on an 
adequately balanced basis. It would therefore 
make sense to correct any problems with the 
distribution of funds between central and state 
government via turnover tax distribution. (However, this article does not address issues 
relating to distribution between these two tiers 
of government or the debate surrounding the 
solidarity surcharge, for example.) In addition, 
there are several types of financial relations be-
tween central and state government which Several levels of

generally either take into consideration specific 
financial requirements of individual federal 
states or are intended to at least partially com-
pensate for the effects of federal legislation on the lower tiers of government.
1
In terms of financial allocation among the fed-
eral states, a very complex system of tax rev -
enue sharing and redistribution has developed 
in order to broadly equalise different financial 
capacities (horizontal financial equalisation). As 
might be expected, financially strong and fi -
nancially weak federal states have very differ -
ent interests. The Federal Constitutional Court 
has been called on several times to examine 
whether individual rules conform to the consti-
tution. As a result of a ruling in 1999, a new 
version of the Act on Financial Equalisation (Fi-
nanzausgleichsgesetz) came into force in 2005. 
However, the new rules, which also cover the 
development programme for eastern Germany, were adopted by mutual consent after lengthy negotiations and included tapered special sup-
plementary central government grants, are valid only until the end of 2019. From 2020, new rules on financial equalisation will be re
-
quired. In addition, the national debt brake (Article 109 III of the German constitution), 
which is designed to prevent debt- financed ex-
penditure almost entirely, will enter into force 
for the federal states by 2020 at the latest.
In mid-2014, central and state government 
 finance ministers established a working group 
to discuss approaches to reforming financial re-
lations in the German federal system. There is a 
possibility of making more far- reaching 
changes. Looking at the current regulations in 
more detail, it can certainly be argued that fun-damental reforms are needed.
Budgetary autonomy and 
scope for design of fiscal policy
Germany’s constitution grants central and state 
governments the right to manage their budgets independently. Tying in with this, they are each 
responsible for their own finances, meaning 
that they must make independent decisions on how to fund their different responsibilities. Pol-iticians in particular often complain that there is only a limited amount of scope for discretion in 
this area. For example, structural factors that 
state government policy usually has little influ-
ence over, such as the number of school- age 
children, and cost disparities associated with 
regional price differences play an important 
role in the level of spending in individual areas 
of responsibility. Moreover, federal legislation 
applies in numerous areas, but the federal states influence this to a considerable extent through the Bundesrat. For instance, social benefits are the same throughout Germany, and it appears that the remuneration frame
-
work for federal state civil servants and retired civil servants, which was standardised until the 2006 federal structure reform, still has a certain 
influence on current arrangements. However, scope for adjustment in this area has mean
-
while increased significantly.2 As a rule, state-  
specific factors can also be taken into account 
in arrangements for employees on negotiated 
pay scales. In addition, there is a large amount 
of discretionary scope, not least regarding the 
specific way in which tasks are performed and, 
for example, how personnel are deployed 
within different areas of responsibility. This can 
also be managed through working time ar -
rangements, for civil servants at least.
For the state governments, tax revenue and as-
sociated transfers are the main items on the 
revenue side. However, the individual federal Reform of finan-
cial equalisation system will be needed and debt brake for federal states will come into force in 2020

tural factors
1 These include joint responsibilities such as university con-
struction or acts governing financial benefits, eg student 
loans and transfers, in which central government bears a 
certain share of the cost (in 2015, the share is set to rise to 
100%). Central government can also grant the federal 
states financial assistance for investment deemed import -
ant from a nationwide perspective.
2 Of course, the provisions of Article 33 of the German 
constitution on civil servants’ entitlement to a salary ad -
equately reflecting the typical scope of responsibilities and 
to pay increases that are generally in line with overall in -
come growth still set certain boundaries. For example, see

states only have very limited options for adjust-
ing tax legislation in a way that would allow 
them to cover specific funding needs. Although 
it has been possible to modify the rate of real 
estate acquisition tax in individual federal states 
since the 2006 federal structure reform,3 
changes to other types of tax that accrue to 
the federal states fully or partially must be im-
plemented for the whole of Germany via fed -
eral legislation. Nevertheless, the federal states 
have an influence over the total revenue due to them from joint, state and municipal taxes. For 
example, it is connected with the strength of 
the local economy, whose growth can be influ-
enced through state government policy (eg through spending on infrastructure or educa
-
tion). The state governments are also respon -
sible for tax administration. Although imple -
mentation is governed by nationwide rules, 
both staffing levels, which have an impact on 
regional tax collection, and the intensity of in-spections can be adjusted.
4 The more the state 
government budgets benefit from regional tax revenue, the greater the incentive to strengthen 
regional economies and ensure effective tax collection. In addition, the federal states re
-
ceive non- tax revenue, which is mainly attribut-
able to fees or other service charges and, as a 
rule, is therefore linked to specific services in 
return. The upper limit of these fees is deter -
mined by the costs that may be included in fee calculations. Regular decisions must ultimately 
be made as to how far below this limit to re -
main, thus making other sources of funding 
necessary (eg for university fees).
Failure to curb debt and 
 obligation to provide 
 emergency assistance
In the past, there was no process to ensure 
that all federal states (and their local author -
ities) had sound public finances. There also ap-
peared to be limited public awareness of the 
general link between different levels of spend-
ing and different tax burdens. Insufficient ac -
count was therefore taken of the fact that 
budgetary autonomy entails the federal states 
bearing responsibility for their own affairs. Gaps between receipts and expenditure have regularly been bridged by net borrowing. Al
-
though the constitutions of the individual 
states set limits on net borrowing in principle, 
these limits were clearly inadequate. As a rule, they were linked to the volume of investment, 
which was defined broadly. Depreciation and asset sales were not taken into account. Fur
-
thermore, the states were able to significantly 
exceed these limits by invoking an exemption clause for overcoming a disruption to macro
-
economic equilibrium, without any subsequent repayment obligations.
However, borrowing has varied significantly 
among the federal states. As early as the 1990s, Despite having 
limited tax legis-lation powers, state govern-ments can influ-ence revenue and cost cover-

3 However, this tax only accounted for 3½% of state gov-ernment tax revenue in 2013, despite several increases over the last few years.4 The empirical study by C Baretti, B Huber and K Lichtblau (2002, A tax on tax revenue: the incentive effects of equal-
izing transfers. Evidence from Germany, International Tax and Public Finance 9(6), pp  631-649) indicates that the 
high revenue absorption rates in the financial equalisation 
system, which have hardly decreased since the study was 
published, had a negative impact on the tax revenue of the federal states. This is regarded as a sign that the individual tax authorities of the federal states are not collecting taxes 
adequately (from the point of view of general govern -
ment). For example, in its 2012 annual report (pp 51-61), 
the Court of Auditors of the state of Bavaria reported an 
increasing shortage of staff in tax administration and asso-ciated shortfalls in revenue.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

Bremen and Saarland applied to the Federal 
Constitutional Court to secure emergency as -
sistance from the German state as a whole 
owing to their very large per capita deficits and 
debt burdens. Substantial financial assistance 
was then granted over a decade without any clear improvement in the budgetary situation subsequently. Although in 2006 the Federal 
Constitutional Court rejected a request for as -
sistance from the heavily-indebted state of Ber -
lin, not least on the grounds that Berlin had not 
yet exhausted all potential for independent 
budget relief measures, state governments can still hope for support from the German state as a whole if their financial situation spirals out of control. This ultimately calls the basic principle of budgetary autonomy into question at a cru-cial point owing to the resulting mismatch be-tween liability and control. There is therefore a risk that, in the event of high deficits in individ-ual states, steps to consolidate budgets will not 
be taken early or decisively enough. Lenders charge low risk premiums even for federal 
states with budgetary difficulties, probably be-cause they assume that joint liability exists as a result of the principle of common responsibility for the federation set out in the German consti-
tution. This encourages state governments to delay consolidation measures, which appears 
politically attractive in the short term.
To alleviate the problem of excessive debt in 
the federal state of Germany, a debt brake for 
both central and state government was en -
shrined in Germany’s constitution in 2009. As 
at that time a number of federal states were 
experiencing difficulties5 and very high budget-
ary deficits were expected in the wake of the 
economic and financial crisis, long transitional 
periods were granted. The permanent, strict 
deficit ceilings anchored in the debt brake are 
not scheduled to take effect until 2016 for cen-
tral government and, for state government, 
they will come into force later still – as of 2020 (Article 143d of the German constitution). Even though state governments could find a certain 
degree of leeway when transposing the debt 
brake into state law, the debt brake is likely to ensure not just more ambitious but also more 
binding debt limitation than previous arrange -
ments and require countermeasures to be 
taken as soon as imbalances arise. In a depart-ure from the scenario hitherto, any future def-icits that breach prescribed ceilings are to entail 
notable political costs both in terms of incon -
venient short- term corrective measures and re-
payment obligations under the debt brake should borrowing limits be exceeded. How
-
ever, the individual state legislators themselves are free to spell out the details of such obliga-tions (in particular, their time frame).
When the decision was taken to introduce a 
debt brake, provisions were made in Germany’s constitution (Article 109a) to establish a Stabil-
ity Council to supervise budgetary policies. As 
early as 2012, the Stability Council ruled that Prospect of 
emergency as-sistance under-mines budgetary autonomy and reduces incen-tives to pursue sound budget -
ary policy

Berlin, Bremen, Saarland and Schleswig-  
Holstein were facing looming budgetary emer -
gencies and initiated a budgetary recovery pro-
cedure for these states, which involved agree -
ing consolidation plans with them spanning 
several years. The Stability Council carries out 
regular checks to ensure that the plans are on track, both in terms of content and implemen-tation. It has requested that Bremen and Saar -
land make subsequent improvements to their 
planned budget relief measures. If the Stability 
Council finds the planned consolidation meas -
ures to be insufficient, it can issue publications to exert political pressure on the states in ques-
tion. Aside from decisions regarding transi -
tional assistance pursuant to Article 143d of the German constitution (consolidation assis
-
tance), the Stability Council has no major 
powers of (financial) sanction or even interven-tion.

Distribution of tax revenue 
and the federal financial equalisation system
As tax revenue is the main source of revenue 
for central, state and local authority budgets, 
its distribution is of vital importance. The aim of 
ensuring broadly equal living conditions throughout Germany features prominently in the German constitution. Article 107 of the 
constitution stipulates that there must be a rea-sonable equalisation of the financial capacities of the state governments. This is to ensure that 
individual states (including their local author -
ities) are in a position to provide essential pub-lic services that are not substantially below the average level in Germany in terms of both qual-ity and volume.
There are different rules governing how rev -
enue from the various types of tax is distributed 
among the federal states. With the exception of turnover tax, receipts from state and joint 
taxes are allocated according to the principle of 
regional revenue. For income tax, this is based 
on the taxpayer’s place of residence. However, for corporation tax (and, similarly, for local au-
thority trade taxes), the profit to be taxed is 
generally broken down between the different 
business locations based on the respective 
share of the wages in the total. Even at this level, doubts have been raised as to the ad
-
equacy of the distribution keys, for example whether they are linked closely enough with the usage of public services provided at that 
location. For instance, city- states are at a disad-
vantage if their services are used by commuters 
from neighbouring municipalities whose in -
come tax is allocated to their place of resi -
dence. From an incentive perspective, it would 
seem worthwhile considering whether to give 
a greater weighting to the place where taxable income is generated.
Turnover tax receipts – which are even more difficult to allocate adequately between re
-
gions – are generally distributed among state governments according to population size. 
However, where required, up to one- quarter of 
the federal states’ share in total turnover tax 
revenue – prior to distribution of the remainder 
among the federal states – is used to reduce 
differences in financial capacity (per capita tax 
revenue adjusted for differences in state-  
specific taxes and state average multiplier dif -
ferentials). The aim is to raise the financial cap-acity of each federal state to at least 94½% of the nationwide average calculated on the basis 
of state taxes and state government shares in 
joint taxes (without any further inclusion of 
turnover tax revenue). In 2013, this resulted in 
redistribution of €7½ billion compared to the 
distribution of the federal states’ total share in 
turnover tax solely according to population size. It is not just the eastern German states 
(excluding Berlin) that benefitted from this on Constitution 
stipulates exten-sive equalisation of federal states’ financial  capacity

6 For those federal states that are scheduled to receive 
consolidation assistance up to and including 2019 because 
of high debt burdens, this assistance can be repealed if 
they do not comply with the agreed adjustment paths. This 
applies to Berlin, Bremen, Saarland, Saxony-  Anhalt and 
Schleswig- Holstein. For a critique of the set- up of the Sta-

Bremen.7
In stage two of the federal financial equalisa -
tion system – the financial equalisation system 
among the federal states (the state govern -
ment revenue- sharing scheme) – local author -
ities’ tax revenue is considered in addition to 
that of the federal state8. However, (as with 
real estate acquisition tax) this is not based on 
their actual local revenue; instead, local busi -
ness tax and real property taxes are adjusted for differences in local authority multipliers. Furthermore, local authorities’ tax generation capacity is not included in full but only 64% 
thereof. On top of all the revenue included in 
the financial equalisation system among the federal states the population of city- states is 
notionally increased (“upgraded”) by 35% to account for structural exceptional burdens, 
such as the higher costs caused by urban ag -
glomeration or the provision of services for residents of other federal states, too. The 
weighting of the population sizes of Mecklen -
burg-  West Pomerania, Brandenburg and Sax -
ony- Anhalt is marginally “upgraded” solely for 
local authority taxes to account for the higher costs of providing public services in particularly 
thinly- populated regions. In relation to the 
equalisation benchmark9, before this equalisa -
tion stage, the federal states’ financial capacity in 2013 ranged from 69% in Berlin (or 86½% in

cial capacity. The state- specific benchmark is calculated 
from all the federal states’ state and local authority per 
capita tax revenue that is included in the financial equalisa-
tion system multiplied by the population size of this par -
ticular federal state (whereby in both cases the population size is “upgraded” as outlined above). Unlike the minimum financial capacity aimed for in the ex ante redistribution of 
turnover tax receipts, this benchmark also includes shares 
in turnover tax, mining royalties and local authorities’ tax 
generation capacity (with a discount) and sets them in rela-tion to the “upgraded” population size.Deutsche Bundesbank

weakest non- city- state) to 116% in Bavaria.10 
After this equalisation stage, a total of €8½ bil-
lion in revenue was redistributed, which already 
largely balanced out the differences in financial 
capacity. In relation to the equalisation bench-
mark, this equalisation stage narrowed the 
range in financial capacity to between 90½% 
in Berlin, which received almost €3½ billion, (or, of the non- city- states, just over 95% in 
Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania) and 105½% in 
Bavaria, which provided almost €4½ billion in 
revenue to be redistributed under the financial equalisation system among the federal states.
11
Given the constitutional requirements, it is ul -
timately the task of elected politicians to nego-tiate an appropriate level of equalisation. How-ever, account must also be taken of the associ-ated negative incentives, and this is the subject of much criticism. For instance, a federal state 
is chiefly alone in funding measures to 
strengthen its local economy, and thus its tax 
revenue, in the long term and in paying the 
costs of tax administration, whereas its revenue 
is shared via the financial equalisation system 
among the federal states. For example, after all stages of financial equalisation, the most popu-
lated state, North Rhine-  Westphalia, was able 
to keep only 18½% of additional income tax 
revenue in 2013 (or 32% of the share accruing to the state and its local authorities).
12 Yet, due 
to its large population and moderate deviations 
from the equalisation benchmark (ie close- to 
average financial capacity per “upgraded” resi-
dent), North Rhine-  Westphalia usually has to 
make the lowest equalisation payments of all 
recipient countries that are entitled to supple -
mentary central government assistance, whereas small, financially weak states have 
much higher revenue absorption rates.13 To en-
sure that greater account was taken of this 
issue, the last reform of the financial equalisa-
tion system among the federal states intro -
duced a retention of 12% of disproportionately 
large per capita revenue growth at state gov -
ernment level as of 2005 (which was not actu-
ally applied to North Rhine-  Westphalia, the 
state cited in the example above, in 2013). However, last year this arrangement (“premium 
model”) resulted in only €¼ billion being ex -
cluded from the financial equalisation system 
among the federal states (the largest individual 
amounts were in Bavaria, Hesse and Berlin) and, in relation to financial capacity at state level, at a maximum of ¼%, the amounts re
-
tained were very limited. Thus the “premium model” does not appear to set significant fi
-
nancial incentives for state governments to 
boost their own tax generation capacity.14
In a final stage, differences in financial capacity 
are reduced further by means of general sup -
plementary central government grants. Those federal states whose financial capacity, after other equalisation payments, is still below 99.5% of the equalisation benchmark receive 77.5% of the difference as a central govern
-
ment grant. These funds, which amounted to “Premium” for 
disproportion-ately large  revenue growth fails to make up for high revenue absorption rates and negative in-centives caused by financial equalisationStage 3: general 
supplementary 
central govern-
ment grants
10 If local authorities’ tax generation capacity is included in 
full and the number of residents is not “upgraded”, per capita financial capacity ranged from 82½% in 
Mecklen burg-  West Pomerania to 130½% in Hamburg.
11 If local authorities’ tax generation capacity is included in 
full and the number of residents is not “upgraded”, this 
results in extreme values of 89½% in Thuringia and 132% 
in Hamburg.12 If the local authorities’ share of 15% is factored out (ie 
if solely the state government budget is considered), this 
would even drop to only 3½% of total additional revenue, 
and just under one- quarter of this would still have to be 
passed on to the municipalities under the financial equal-
isation system for the local authorities.13 The revenue absorption rate would be much higher in 
Bremen, for example, as only 6½% of the additional total 
revenue would not be deducted within the whole system 
of financial equalisation. If the local authorities’ share is 
factored out, the state budget would even lose some of its 
funds. For more information, see also the calculations of 
marginal absorption rates and residual quotas in the finan-cial equalisation system in B Huber and K Lichtblau (1998),

just over €3 billion at last report, ensure that 
the financial capacities of recipient states are raised to at least 97½% of the equalisation 
benchmark and, as a result, perceptibly reduce the remaining differences in financial capacity.
15
In addition, supplementary central government grants are also granted for special requirements 
(special supplementary central government 
grants) and these can even reverse the rankings 
of the states’ financial capacity (in relation to 
the equalisation benchmark). While the Federal 
Constitutional Court has ruled that general 
supplementary central government grants and 
horizontal financial equalisation among the 
federal states must not change these rankings, 
this does not apply to special supplementary 
central government grants. However, they can 
only be granted if there is specific justification 
and as long as there is no discrimination be -
tween the federal states. Currently, a total of €½ billion has been granted to cover the “above-  average costs of political administra
-
tion” in smaller states, and just over €½ billion 
has been paid to eastern German states (ex -
cluding Berlin) due to higher burdens caused by structural long- term unemployment in connec-
tion with the Hartz IV reform.
16
The third reason for granting special supple -
mentary central government grants is to cover 
burdens resulting from the former partitioning 
of Germany (with regard to infrastructure and 
local authorities’ below- average financial cap -
acity) in eastern German states and Berlin. 
These make up by far the largest share of the 
special supplementary central government 
grants but will be gradually phased out by the end of 2019. Last year €6½ billion was granted 
for this purpose (down from €10½ billion in Special supple-
mentary central government grants for higher costs of political administration, burdens caused by long- term unemploy-ment …

2005), of which almost half was paid to Saxony 
and Berlin. Recipient states report to the Stabil-ity Council once a year on the usage of funds. However, in the past, many federal states were unable to provide the required proof that they 
had used enough of these funds for invest -
ment.17 As a result, the gaps in infrastructure 
provision which were assumed when the pay -
ments were agreed are not being closed with 
these grants as was originally planned.18 There 
is also criticism that some other federal states 
also have considerable infrastructure deficits 
but are not entitled to such assistance.Starting points for the

relations19
Greater tax autonomy seems appropriate in view of  responsibility for own  affairs 
and debt brake
Indebtedness in many federal states has in -
creased sharply in recent decades, influenced in 
part by extensive budgetary autonomy (particu-
larly in terms of expenditure) combined with 
less stringent credit limits and de facto implicit federal budgetary bail- outs. An important step 
has been taken in enshrining the debt brake, 
which the federal states will also have to imple-
ment in full by 2020, in the German constitu -
tion. However, some states still face substantial challenges in ensuring reliable compliance with 
requirements by 2020 and beyond. The scope 
of the necessary adjustment measures varies drastically from state to state.
20 These differ -
ences are due, among other factors, to current 
budget deficit levels, the prior burden placed 
on budgets by debt servicing, the level of and increase in pension benefits for civil servants at 
state government level, and the future phase-  
out of special supplementary central govern -
ment grants and consolidation assistance. With regard to the imminent reform of federal finan-cial relations, the fundamental objective of en-Debt brake

suring broadly equal living conditions through-
out Germany must be taken into account, as 
should federal states’ responsibility for their 
own affairs (including for debt accumulated in 
the past) and the necessary flexibility that this 
entails.
With respect to revenue, individual federal 
states currently have little leeway in terms of making changes to tax law in order to cover 
their respective financial needs. Consequently, 
higher state- specific spending preferences or 
other special needs have hitherto been fi -
nanced by borrowing in many cases, which has 
further increased the sustained squeeze on 
budgets. The debt brake is designed to prevent 
this method of financing, and specific prefer -
ences for additional public services will have to 
be financed through shifts in expenditure or 
higher revenue. As a result, greater focus now has to be placed on extending avenues to per -
mit variations in tax law. Limited, state- specific 
surcharges and discounts on individual types of tax such as income and corporation tax, as pro-
posed by some parties, could address this. 
Given the differences in the economic strength of individual federal states, identical surcharges 
could, for example, result in different levels of 
additional revenue and budgetary scope per capita being formed. However, the financial 
equalisation system could, to a certain extent, 
make adjustments for such differences (see ex-
planatory notes on pages 44 to 46). Switzer -
land’s experience illustrates that permitting 
variations in tax law, despite considerable dif -
ferences in economic strength across cantons, 
need not result in the states undercutting each other’s tax rates in a “race to the bottom” that 
would lead to substantial cuts in public ser -
vices.
From an economic perspective, extending tax 
autonomy in this way would forge a desirable 
link between public services and the level of 
taxation in individual federal states, with indi -
viduals and enterprises ultimately able to de -
cide whether they are prepared to pay more 
tax for the improved public services on offer. At the same time, the clearer link between rev -
enue and expenditure would increase pressure 
to make government activities more cost-  
effective in order to keep the tax burden as low as possible and to ensure that the federal state 
remains attractive. This would strengthen the 
states’ responsibility for their own financial af -
fairs in the long term while taking into account 
the significantly reduced scope for borrowing 
under the debt brake. Otherwise, almost all ad-
justments would have to be made on the ex -
penditure side.
Transparency and degree 
of equalisation under the  financial equalisation system
The marked differences in economic strength 
from region to region mean that the distribu -
tion of tax receipts across the federal states ac-
cording to the proceeds collected by the tax 
administrations in their territory would lead to 
relatively wide disparities in the financial cap -
acity of the federal states (including their local 
authorities). The precise extent to which these 
disparities should be limited is a political deci -
sion, which must meet the constitutional re -
quirements.
As a result of the various equalisation mechan-
isms in place, there is currently a maximum 
range of around 15 percentage points21 in the 
financial capacity of the different federal states. 
This is relatively narrow. An argument in favour 
of allowing these disparities to persist is that federal states with high economic strength, a high wage level and, as a result of these fac
-
tors, above-  average financial capacity will also 
tend to have higher price levels and thus higher 
(nominal) financial needs. While disparities be-Greater leeway

The introduction of state-level tax surcharges and discounts
General aspects
In principle, there are various means of in-
creasing the federal states’ tax autonomy. 
Introducing a comprehensive system of separate taxation, with each federal state 
levying its own taxes alongside central gov-
ernment (potentially also including taxes 
that already exist at the central government level, as in the United States or Switzerland) would amount to a sea change in the Ger-man fi  scal federal system, yet this is not on the fi  scal policy agenda.
A much less sweeping change would be to 
transfer legislative powers for the existing 
state- level taxes to the individual states1 or 
entitle them to levy surcharges on a portion 
of the joint taxes which are shared among 
different tiers of government. The state- 
level taxes do not yield especially high rev-
enues, and allowing regional variation in 
turnover tax rates would probably cause 
both sizeable shifts and substantial diffi   cul-ties relating to input tax deductions. Conse-
quently, the option of a surcharge on in-come and corporation tax
2 is usually the 
main focus of the debate.3 This would not 
only mean giving the states legislative powers to introduce their own individual 
surcharges or discounts but also establish-
ing rules on revenue entitlements so that the receipts can fl  ow into federal state 
budgets. All in all, practical implementation 
would probably be more complex for cor-
poration tax than for income tax given the 
diffi   culties involved in the regional division 
of profi  ts under the “business location” principle, which is already applicable prior to tax assessment. Even so, local business tax is already levied in a similar way, with different multipliers applied in different 
local authorities. The option which appears easiest to implement is the introduction of 
state- specifi  c proportional surcharges or 
discounts using a uniform assessment base, 
eg the fi  xed tax liability (before transfer 
components for child benefi  t are deducted). 
As tax generation capacity varies across the 
federal states, the same surcharge would yield different amounts of revenue from state to state. Imposing upper and lower 
limits on the surcharges could help to allay any concerns about their use. An additional 
option in this kind of reform would be to 
give local authorities the power to set their own multipliers for their respective shares in income tax, which is already made possible by Article 106 (V) sentence 3 of the German constitution (Basic Law, or Grundgesetz).
1 This would apply, in particular, to inheritance and gift 
tax, beer tax, race betting tax, lottery tax and sport 
betting tax (totalling just over 3% of the federal states’ 
tax revenue). Legislative power to set the rate of real 
estate acquisition tax has already been transferred to 
the federal states.
2 It would generally seem advisable to exclude tax-
ation of capital gains from state- specifi  c powers to levy 
surcharges, as the assessment base is likely to be 
highly mobile. For technical reasons, however, this is 
not entirely possible in the current tax system. As an 
alternative, withholding tax on interest income and capital gains and non- assessed taxes on earnings 
(mainly investment income tax on dividends) are fac-
tored out of our calculations here.3 See, for example, T Büttner and R Schwager (2003),

Response of tax assessment base 
and fi  nancial equalisation system
The decision to apply surcharges and dis-counts and the associated revenue effects depend, among other factors, on the re-
sponse of the tax assessment base and on 
the extent to which the revenue effects 
caused by the surcharges and discounts are 
included in the fi  nancial equalisation sys-
tem. It is conceivable that varying tax rates 
could lead to relocations within Germany. 
Taxpayers in smaller states and border re-
gions would probably be more inclined to 
relocate because of changes in tax rates. 
However, the cost of relocation, which can be substantial, is another factor to consider. 
For example, a large infl  ux of new arrivals 
to a location with more favourable tax rates 
could drive up local real estate prices and 
rents and lower them in the areas they have just left. If these new residents continued to 
work in the same place, the longer com-mute would usually increase their travel 
costs. There are therefore signifi  cant factors 
working against relocation, thus limiting 
the mobility of the tax base. Ultimately, the tax burden in a federal state is not the only 
relevant factor which plays into such deci-
sions; there are many others, such as the 
tax- funded public services that the state has to offer.
Another important aspect to consider is the 
interaction between the federal states’ tax 
autonomy and the fi  nancial equalisation 
system. If the revenue from a state tax sur-
charge were fully included in the fi  nancial 
equalisation system, and if the revenue dif-
ferences caused solely by differences in tax rates were also evened out, this would cre-
ate an undesirable incentive for each state 
to reduce its own surcharge rate at the ex-
pense of the other states. Consequently, the measurement of fi  nancial capacity 
should not be based on the actual revenue collected by the states but their revenue ad-
justed for tax rate differences – much like 
the current arrangements for real estate ac-
quisition tax, local business tax and real property taxes. Depending on how the fi  -nancial equalisation tariff is designed and 
how many of the federal states impose sur-
charges or discounts, this could cause a greater portion of the varying tax gener-
ation capacity underlying the surcharge to Revenue effect of a 10% state surcharge

be evened out than under the current 
 fi  nancial equalisation arrangements.4
Possible revenue effects of a limited 
 surcharge
This paragraph outlines the results of some 
sample calculations to determine the rev-
enue effects of state- specifi  c surcharges or 
discounts. Under a status quo scenario, no 
relocations, other changes in the tax base 
or effects within the fi  nancial equalisation 
system are taken into account.5 If, for ex-
ample, a maximum surcharge or discount 
of 10% on the tax liability were considered 
acceptable, this would result in maximum 
additional revenue or a maximum revenue 
shortfall of around €24 billion based on the 
tax receipts which accrued in 2013. The range of the per capita revenue effects across the individual states would be sub-stantial. At around €160 in most cases, 
these effects would be lowest in the federal states in eastern Germany, although the dif-
ferences would be small (with the excep-
tion of Brandenburg). The revenue effect in 
Hamburg, at almost €420, would be far above the nationwide average of around 
€290, although this average would also be exceeded by one- fi  fth in Hesse and Baden- 
Württemberg and by one- quarter in Bav-
aria.6
Based on the 2013 defi  cits,7 the additional 
revenue that could be generated from sur-
charges for Bremen and Saarland, for ex-
ample, would not be suffi   cient on its own 
to avoid new borrowing – despite the fact 
that the substantial consolidation assistance based on Article 143 d of the German con-stitution is taken into account in these cal-culations. It would only be possible to close 
around two- thirds of the funding gap in 
Bremen and less than one- third of the gap in Saarland. Consolidation measures on the 
expenditure side would thus remain un-avoidable. Hesse, on the other hand, could 
easily eliminate its high defi  cit through a 
surcharge alone. In Hamburg, North Rhine- 
Westphalia and Rhineland- Palatinate, the existing defi  cits would be signifi  cantly below the maximum additional revenue. 
Other states, such as Bavaria or some states 
in eastern Germany, are currently posting 
surpluses, which would, in principle, allow 
them to use most of the available discount. However, the phase- out of the special sup-
plementary central government grants by 
2019 will place a strain on the budgets of 
the eastern German states, and for all states the signifi  cant rise projected in pension pay-ments for civil servants should also be taken into account.
4 Applying the rules currently in force for taxes with 
state- specifi  c or local authority- specifi  c rates, under 
the fi  nancial equalisation system the total revenue 
from surcharges and discounts in Germany would be 
allocated to the individual states in proportion to their 
tax assessment base. If all states levied the same sur-
charge, differences in revenue relating to the sur-charge would therefore be evened out in the same way as other tax receipts under the usual fi  nancial equalisation arrangements. However, should only a 
few smaller states levy a surcharge, for example, the 
additional revenue accruing to states with high fi  nan-
cial capacity would remain very limited. As a result, 
under the fi  nancial equalisation system hardly any add-itional revenue would then accrue to the states levying 
the surcharge even if their fi  nancial capacity were far 
below the average. If a larger state with particularly high fi  nancial capacity opted for a discount, most of 
the tax reduction would be imputed to the other states under the fi  nancial equalisation system, meaning that 
only a small portion of the budget burden would ul-
timately be taken into account in the fi  nancial equal-
isation system.5 The estimates include a global correction for deduc-
tions of child benefi  t transfers from income tax rev-
enue.
6 In the current fi  nancial equalisation system, and if 
surcharges are factored into the calculations in a simi-
lar way to real estate acquisition tax, levying the sur-
charge in full in all states would signifi  cantly reduce 
the range across all stages of redistribution. The states 
in eastern Germany, like those with lower fi  nancial capacity in western Germany, would gain additional 
revenue of around €280 per capita; the outcomes in 
Bavaria, Hesse and Baden- Württemberg would only be 
around one- tenth higher. As a result of the “upgrad-
ing” of the number of inhabitants, all city- states would receive additional revenue of at least €380 per capita.

tween urban and rural areas undoubtedly play 
a central role in price level differences,22 differ -
ences are also mirrored appreciably at federal 
state level.23
As a general rule, no revenue equalisation 
could be justified if the differences in financial 
capacity were solely the result of diverging 
price levels that were also reflected accordingly 
in the federal states’ expenditure (costs). At federal state level, a number of other factors are certainly also involved, but differences in federal states’ financial capacity and costs 
should not ultimately be attributable to them. 
For example, options for regional variation in civil servant salaries (and pension benefits), which are a central cost component for the 
federal states, are permitted with good reason 
and are also likely to be used to a greater ex -
tent in the future. This could also play a greater 
role with respect to salaried public employees 
so that distinctive regional features are taken 
into account; furthermore, some federal states 
have not participated in the collective wage bargaining system of the federal states in the 
past. This allows the federal states to take ac -
count of the level of remuneration and pay 
trends in the local private sector. Differing price 
levels (eg in connection with regional rents) 
would also make nominal remuneration differ -
ences between federal states possible without 
this causing systematic differences in employ -
ees’ purchasing power. Due to the currently 
relatively narrow range in pay for public- sector 
employees – whose duties are generally com -
parable – across the federal states, real pay in 
financially weak federal states is likely to be es-pecially high on account of lower regional price levels. Overall, the significance of regional price differences for the federal financial equalisation 
system has scarcely been reflected in the re -
form discussion up to now. Taking this fully into 
account would also be difficult. Even so, the 
notable differences in regional price levels sug-gest that the existing gap in (nominal) financial 
capacity should, at the very least, be main -
tained, or ideally increased further so as to pre-vent the potential reversal of financial capacity rankings in real terms.
24
A reform of the financial equalisation system 
which is designed to increase transparency and 
reduce negative incentives should incorporate 
all stages of the horizontal and vertical financial equalisation system.
25
The ex ante redistribution of turnover tax re -
ceipts (ie supplementary shares), which is based 
on a narrower definition of financial capacity, could be abolished. Turnover tax revenue would then be fully distributed among the 
states according to population size, and inter-  
state redistribution could be relocated entirely 
to the actual financial equalisation system 
among the federal states.

(Bonn 2009) published by the Federal Institute for Research 
on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development (Bun -

points. There is a correlation between a federal state’s  financial strength and the regional price level. Values are 
below average in the eastern German states, in particular.

Financial repercussions of simplifying and limiting 
the federal fi  nancial equalisation system in Germany
Like the distribution of turnover tax receipts 
between central government and the fed-
eral states, and the central government transfers which supplement the actual fi  -
nancial equalisation system among the fed-
eral states (state government revenue- sharing scheme), the redistribution of tax 
revenue among Germany’s federal states is 
governed by the Act on Financial Equalisa-
tion (Finanzausgleichsgesetz)  in line with 
requirements set out in the German consti-
tution (Basic Law, or Grundgesetz). The 
question of how best to adequately reduce 
differences in fi  nancial capacity between 
the federal states has t raditionally been the subject of lengthy and complex political ne-
gotiations. When considering how to re-
form the federal fi  nancial equalisation sys-
tem in Germany, it is important to bear in 
mind that the revenue and expenditure of a 
federal state, including its local authorities, 
are not readily accessible in the short term. If prepared some time in advance, however, 
even fairly substantial corrections are pos-
sible, although these must ultimately satisfy 
the constitutional aim of ensuring broadly equal living conditions throughout Ger-
many. In parallel with the reform of the fi  -
nancial equalisation system, the federal 
states will also be obliged to meet the strict 
debt brake requirements under Article 
109 III of the German constitution from the 
2020 budget year at the latest. This box 
outlines, by way of example, the repercus-
sions of various reform options based on 
data taken from the preliminary settlement for the federal fi  nancial equalisation system for 2013.
The current fi  nancial equalisation system is 
extremely complicated, and a signifi  cantly 
simpler and more transparent set- up would be welcome. To help to achieve this, the ex 
ante redistribution of turnover tax receipts 
could be abolished (with all turnover tax shares being distributed among the states according to population size), full account 
could be taken of local authority taxes (after 
adjustment for differences in their multi-pliers), a proportional equalisation tariff (with a constant revenue absorption and top- up rate) could be introduced and the 
rather ineffective practice of partially factor-
ing out disproportionately large growth in state government tax revenue could be eliminated. The same proportional tariff 
could also be applied to the general supple-
mentary central government grants, which 
could continue to provide additional partial 
compensation for states whose fi  nancial 
capacity is below 99.5% of the equalisation benchmark.
1
The outcome currently obtained in the fed-
eral fi  nancial equalisation system could be 
almost matched in the framework outlined 
above with a constant revenue absorption 
and top- up rate of 60% (reform model 1). 
For a state whose fi  nancial capacity is close 
to the equalisation benchmark, this rate 
would be higher than the current rate in the 
progressive tariff. The volume of funds re-
distributed under the fi  nancial equalisation 
system among the federal states would in-
crease to €13 billion and would thus be 
€4½ billion higher than in the current sys-
tem. However, factoring in the ex ante re-
distribution of turnover tax receipts – which 
admittedly works somewhat differently – 
would result in a (limited) net reduction in 
the burden on the states obliged to make 
equalisation payments. By contrast, the bur-
den on central government created by the 
general supplementary central government 
grants would be around €1½ billion higher 
(just over €3 billion at last report). In most 
cases, there would be only a moderate re-
duction in the portion of additional tax rev-enue that is absorbed.
Reducing the revenue absorption and top- 
up rate to 50% (reform model 2) would strengthen the incentives to increase tax generation capacity. States with above- 
average fi  nancial capacity would then actu-

equalisation benchmark.Deutsche Bundesbank

ally retain, in total, just over half of the add-
itional tax revenue included in the fi  nancial 
equalisation system;2 for states with below- 
average fi  nancial capacity, the portion that 
is absorbed would remain relatively high 
because of offsetting against the supple-
mentary central government grants. For ex-
ample, in the most populated state, North 
Rhine- Westphalia (which, if the ex ante re-
distribution of turnover tax receipts were abolished, would have above- average fi  -nancial capacity and would no longer re-ceive supplementary central government grants), just under 40% of the additional 
revenue would still be absorbed, compared with 68% in the current system. In Bremen, 
the smallest state, which would still be af-
fected by offsetting against the supplemen-
tary central government grants, the total 
deductions would amount to almost 75%, 
compared with nearly 89% in the current 
system.
However, the lower revenue absorption 
rate would somewhat widen the remaining 
differences in fi  nancial capacity after the 
general supplementary central government 
grants had been paid. The volume of funds 
redistributed under the fi  nancial equalisa-
tion system among the federal states would 
be just under €11 billion, and central gov-
ernment would contribute €5 billion via the 
general supplementary central government 
grants. While, in the current system, the non- city- states’ fi  nancial capacity in euros 
per “non- upgraded” inhabitant (factoring in 
the local authorities’ fi  nancial capacity in 
full) would range from 91½% of the nation-wide average in Thuringia to 104% in Bav-
aria, the outlined reform would widen the 
gap between these two states somewhat, which would then range from 88½% to 105½%. While North Rhine- Westphalia, 
Baden- Württemberg, Hesse and, above all, 
Bavaria would see signifi  cant increases in 
their fi  nancial capacity, which would range 
from around €50 to €100 per capita, the states of Thuringia, Saxony and Saxony- Anhalt would each see a loss of around 
€100 per capita. Looking at the city- states, the amount of funds lost in Berlin would be 
similar, while in Bremen the loss would amount to around €130 per capita. It is the task of elected politicians to decide whether these fi  nancial losses should be regarded as more important than the positive incentives 
2 The reason for the higher retention of funds in the 
state collecting the tax compared with the amount re-
maining after applying the revenue absorption rate is 
that the total revenue to be distributed (and thus also 
the equalisation benchmarks for all states according to 
their share in the weighted number of inhabitants) would be higher. These calculations include only the 
portion of the revenue that accrues to the states and 
the local authorities (central government’s share in the proceeds of joint taxes is not included). When looking 
at how much a state would retain of the total add-
itional tax revenue it collected (eg through more inten-
sive tax inspections), the additional shares transferred 
to central government would also have to be taken 
into account.Financial capacity of the federal states in 2013 under different financial equalisation systems

they create, the next step could be to introduce 
a proportional equalisation tariff (with uniform 
revenue absorption and top-  up rates) and to 
lower the equalisation rate, at least on aver -
age26 (see explanatory notes on pages 48 to 
50). At the same time, full inclusion of local au-
thorities’ tax-

ation capacity would be ap-
propriate from an economic perspective.27 The 
federal state and its local authorities form an economic unit, and the federal state is ultim -

26 It would then be possible to dispense with the opaque 
and rather ineffective premium model, in which dispropor -
tionately high tax revenue growth at federal state level is 
partly factored out.
27 In 1992 (Bundesverfassungsgericht 86, 148) and 1999 
(Bundesverfassungsgericht 101, 158), the Federal Constitu-tional Court ruled that a global reduction in financial cap-
acity would be acceptable with respect to local non-  
personal taxes due to the link between the amount of tax 
paid and the use of public services at local level, whereas 
this would not be mandatory for shares in joint taxes. 
However, a systematic financial equalisation system should 
fully include local authorities’ overall tax generation cap -
acity. Any corrective action deemed necessary would need to be explained in detail.28 See for example T Büttner, R Schwager and D Stegarescu 
(2004), Agglomeration, population size and the cost of 
providing public services: an empirical analysis for German states, Public Finance and Management 4 (4), pp 496-520. 
By contrast, this study finds that functional areas typically 
governed solely at state government level (eg political ad-
ministration, financial administration, legal protection and 
public order and safety) do not generate significantly 
higher agglomeration-  r elated costs that would justify the 
“upgrading” of the number of inhabitants with respect to state tax revenue.Deutsche Bundesbank

government. In addition, it would appear to 
make more sense to compensate for “spill-
overs” from the use of city-  states’ public ser -
vices by surrounding regions, which are often 
used as an argument for “upgrading” the num-
ber of inhabitants, by improving coordination 
with neighbouring states or changing the way 
in which wage tax yields are allotted to those 
states (taking greater account of the “business 
location” principle), rather than via a financial 
equalisation system among the federal states 
which has redistribution effects throughout 
Germany.
The special supplementary central government 
grants also appear to be in need of reform. 
These are currently paid to 10 of the 16 states 
given the “above-
 aver
age costs of political ad-
ministration” in smaller states. However, the city-
 state of Hambur
g, which is small but has 
relatively high financial capacity, does not re -
ceive this payment. In addition to this unsys -
tematic set-  up, however , the rationale behind 
these grants does not appear to be convincing 
either. Empirical studies indicate that the add -
itional costs associated with small administra -
tive units are limited.29 It would also seem rea-
sonable to consider merging federal states as a 
response to possible cost disadvantages for 
smaller states or, should residents prefer smaller 
(administrative) structures, to also allocate the 
corresponding costs to them. Furthermore, eastern German states (excluding Berlin) re-
ceive special grants due to higher burdens 
caused by structur
al unemployment. Critics 
point out that other federal states with at least 
similarly high levels of unemployment do not 
receive such payments. With respect to general 
supplementary central government grants, which are the final stage in the process of evening out differences in financial capacity, the constitutional provision preserving their 
subordinate role to the actual financial equal-
isation system among the federal states should be taken into account.
The degree of redistribution under the financial 
equalisation system will need to be determined during the forthcoming negotiations. Should 
these again ultimately result in a relatively sub-stantial reduction of the differences in financial capacity, leaving the states with only moderate 
financial incentives, at best, to implement tax 
legislation as effectively as possible, the option of transferring tax administration to the central 
government level should be considered.30 This 
would facilitate uniform application of the law 
across Germany, which is desirable, and limit 
any potential incentive-  r elated deficits in imple-
mentation.
Possible relief for highly 
 indebted feder
al states and 
safeguarding of sound budgets
When the debt brake is implemented, highly 
indebted federal states must have either lower primary expenditure than the nationwide aver -
age or impose substantially higher tax sur -
charges – should these be introduced – com -
pared to the other federal states. The debt ser -
vicing burden is currently being dampened very 
strongly by the extremely low interest rate 
level, with the average rate of interest among 
the federal states having fallen by a third be -
tween 2007 and 2013 from almost 4½% to just under 3%. With respect to the interest burden, budgetary autonomy together with responsibil-ity for own affairs implies that the federal states should bear this alone and, in particular, that it 
should not be possible to pass the burden on … reviewing the

Finance put the possible efficiency savings for general gov-ernment of a central tax administration at €11½ billion an-
nually (see Federal Ministry of Finance, Monthly Report, 
March 2007, pp 75-86). Alternatively, the costs of tax col-
lection could be covered by a joint budget for all federal 
states, to which the states would allocate funds according 
to their tax revenue or population size. However, it is un -
certain whether actual tax collection would be more effect-ive as a result. It would probably be necessary to assess its actual effectiveness in great depth.Deutsche Bundesbank

to other federal states. On the other hand, for 
a more extensive reform of the fiscal constitu -
tion in particular, it has been proposed that 
states with particularly high debt levels receive 
support during the transition to the new sys -
tem. Various options are being discussed in this 
regard. For example, funds from the federal 
state of Germany as a whole could be used to 
cover part of these states’ interest expenses for 
a set period, or payments could be granted along similar lines to the existing transitional 
assistance. However, the prerequisite for such 
support would be for the states in question to 
achieve and subsequently safeguard budget 
consolidation.
The Stability Council could be tasked with 
monitoring compliance with the corresponding obligations. It would be essential to ensure that 
the data used for such decisions were suffi -
ciently meaningful. In particular, it would ap -
pear necessary to use budgetary and financial 
planning data updated to the cut- off date for 
all federal states (including with respect to the 
tax estimate), to include off- budget entities 
and to record net financial transactions, global budget items that have yet to be set out in de-tail, and one- off expenses and cost savings in a 
transparent manner. Generally speaking, it 
would stand to reason that budgetary surveil -
lance within the German state would be more 
stringent than at the European level. Should this surveillance reveal that federal states re
-
ceiving transitional assistance are in danger of 
breaching the debt brake requirements, this in-
formation should be made public and the states in question should be required to take 
immediate corrective action. Should the states fail to make sufficient improvements, financial 
assistance could be withdrawn.31 In addition, 
another prerequisite for financial assistance 
could be to invest central government or other 
federal state governments with the right to propose motions in the state constitutional 
courts examining whether controversial budget acts comply with constitutional requirements.
Overall, it is very important that the debt brake, 
as laid down in the German constitution, is im-plemented consistently in all federal states. This 
includes limiting ways of circumventing32 the 
debt brake as much as possible. As the debt brake will require swift action to counteract any deficits, it would appear advisable to ex
-
pand the fiscal policy adjustment options avail-
able to the individual federal states. Allowing them to impose their own limited surcharges 
and discounts on income and corporation tax 
would also be suitable for this purpose. To be 
able to avoid potentially procyclical counter -
measures in the event of unexpected negative 
shocks, it would also make sense to plan in 
safety margins below the upper credit limits, as at the central government level.… only if budge t

31 The introduction of tax surcharges and/or across- the- 
board spending cuts in areas governed by state- specific 
 legislative powers, which will come into force automatic -
ally, would seem even more effective. However, their im -
plementation could present substantial problems.
32 Ways of doing this include, for example, the use of off- 
budget entities, determining extremely prolonged redemp-
tion schedules where use is made of exemptions (emer -
gency situations), inadequate cyclical adjustment methods or factoring out budgetary burdens from the structural def-
icit by classifying them as financial transactions. For the 
cyclical components taken into account, it would be advis-
able to introduce a control account which, in principle, 
would need to be balanced out over time.Deutsche Bundesbank

The performance of German credit 
 institutions in 2013
The 2013 reporting year saw the German banking industry generate operating income which, 
against the backdrop of a declining volume in balance sheet business, was well down on the 
previous year; indeed, at €120 billion, it was at its lowest level since the crisis year of 2008. This 
decrease must be seen in the context of what remained a challenging environment characterised by historically low interest rates as well as by subdued overall demand for bank- specific products 
and an ongoing need for regulatory adjustments. This contrasted, however, with an improvement in capital- related resilience and progress in the restructuring of core business areas.
With the exception of net commissions received, there were losses in all the components of oper-
ational business. Net interest received, by far banks’ most important source of income, contracted 
by almost €6 billion, or 6.4%. Income from traditional deposit and lending business, on the other 
hand, was comparatively stable with largely unchanged margins. Owing to a sharply reduced 
balance sheet total resulting from a further reduction in holdings of trading derivatives, the 
(unadjusted) interest margin was somewhat higher than its very low figure in the previous year. Net trading income, which is typically very volatile, showed a considerable decline of €1.3 billion 
(18%) in the reporting year, with special factors and valuation effects having an impact. Other 
operating income amounted to -€0.9 billion, dropping to its lowest level since 1993.
Owing to a deterioration in the cost/income ratio along with virtually unchanged operating costs, 
there was a significant fall by €9.1 billion to €37.1 billion in the operating result before valuation of assets. Because the valuation result was still very moderate (-€6.5 billion), the operating result after valuation (operating result) was, at €30.6 billion, nevertheless still clearly above the long- term average of €22.8 billion.
Of banks’ profit for the year after taxes, €7.9 billion at the aggregate level is earmarked to further 
strengthen their balance sheet capital as part of the appropriation of profit. Taking into account the renewed increase, to €8.1 billion, in net losses brought forward, banks posted a net loss for the 2013 financial year, as they did in the previous five years. The loss in 2013 was, at €1.7 billion, higher than one year earlier.Deutsche Bundesbank

Banks’ business environment
The macrofinancial environment for domestic 
banks’ business activities showed tendencies 
towards an easing of tensions in the reporting 
year, yet remained difficult and susceptible to 
shocks. On the equity markets and the markets 
for bonds of non- financial corporations, de -
clines in risk premiums contributed to sizeable 
price gains owing to an intensive “search for yield” by investors in a pronounced low-  
interest- rate environment. By contrast, the 
interest rate linkage with the United States 
caused a marked up and down movement dur -
ing the course of the year, notably at the long 
end of the maturity spectrum for sovereign 
bonds. The Eurosystem’s main refinancing rate 
was lowered in May and November 2013. 
However, money market rates did not decline 
further during the course of the year, and the 
deposit rate was, at the same time, unchanged. The money market rate in the three- month sec-
tor did fall by 0.35 percentage points to 0.22% on the year (annual average), however. During the course of 2013, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy counterparties made early repayments of 
around €450 billion on the two outstanding three- year refinancing operations from 2011 
and 2012; nonetheless, the domestic banking 
system’s liquidity situation remained generous.
A wide range of banks’ activities in 2013 were 
geared to early implementation of the new 
supervisory standards contained in the Basel III 
regime. The main focus was on strengthening 
regulatory capital, withdrawing from non- core 
business areas, and scaling back foreign expos-
ures and risk- bearing assets.
Macroeconomic developments in Germany 
continued to have a positive impact on credit 
institutions’ operations and earnings. Credit in-
stitutions benefited mainly from the fact that economic activity in 2013 was increasingly being driven by domestic demand forces and that the economy, buoyed by high employ
-
ment and a benign price climate, grew at a stable underlying pace in line with normal util-isation of aggregate capacity.
The latest results of the statistics on German 
banks’ profit and loss accounts (profit and loss statistics) are based on the published annual re-
ports of all banks in accordance with the ac -
counting rules of the Act to Modernise Ac -
counting Law (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsge -
setz),1 which entered into force in 2010. This 
includes all banks within the meaning of the 
German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) that 
are monetary financial institutions and are 
domiciled in Germany. Building and loan asso-
ciations, institutions in liquidation as well as in-
stitutions with a truncated financial year are 
not included in this performance analysis. The 
reporting sample for 2013 contained 1,726 in-
stitutions; this is 28 banks fewer than in the 
previous year and 177 fewer than in 2007, the 
last year before the financial crisis.
The individual accounts drawn up in accord -
ance with the German Commercial Code (Han-delsgesetzbuch) and used as a basis here differ in terms of their conception, structure and def-initions from the internationally customary IFRS accounting standards
2 for publicly traded bank-
ing groups, which means that the business re-
sults and certain balance sheet or individual profit/loss items are not (directly) comparable for methodological reasons. For reasons of 
comparability, when analysing the earnings of 
the German banking industry it is advisable to 
consider the individual accounts. Using group 
accounts would make a meaningful analysis 
difficult as, first, many banks are not part of a 
group, meaning that their individual accounts 
drawn up in accordance with the German 
Commercial Code would still have to be used; Financial and

Net interest received declines 
while margins remain  unchanged
Net interest income, which totalled €86.4 bil -
lion or 71.9% of operating income,4 remained 
by far the most important source of income for 
the German banking sector. As a collective 
item, net interest received comprises net inter -
est income in the narrower sense as well as the 
other interest- related income components. Net 
interest income in the narrower sense, which contains interest expenditure and interest in
-
come from traditional deposit and lending 
business,5 totalled €72 billion (60% of operat-
ing income). The other income components of 
net interest received include current income 
from shares and other variable- yield securities, 
participating interests, shares in affiliated enter -
prises and income from profit transfers.6 In the 
reporting year, these income components con-
tributed €14.4 billion (12.0% of operating in -
come) to net interest received. The big banks 
sector accounted for €7.5 billion of that figure. 
The corresponding amount for networked in -
stitutions7 was €3.8 billion, which mainly con -
sisted of current income from shares and other 
variable- yield securities. This is likely to reflect 
exposure to specialised funds,8 which for these 
categories of banks takes the place of securities business.
Amidst a drop in both interest income and interest expenditure, net interest received de
-
creased sharply on the year (by €5.9 billion to 
€86.4 billion). This deterioration was largely at-
tributable to the other income components and 
had a considerable effect on income from profit Income com-

Most of the time series go back to 1968. When the new 
accounting legislation for credit institutions entered into ef-fect in 1993, new time series were introduced and a num-ber of terms were redefined. This made it difficult to com-
pare income- related data from 1993 onwards with earlier 
data (see Deutsche Bundesbank, The new accounting legis-
lation for credit institutions applicable from 1993, and its 
implications for the monthly balance sheet statistics, 
Monthly Report, May 1992, pp 37-46).

transfers in the big banks sector. The decline in 
this case was practically the outcome of a coun-
termovement to a positive one- off effect that 
was partly responsible for the sharp rise in 2012. In addition, net interest income in the narrower 
sense, at €72 billion, fell short of the previous 
year’s level by €2.1 billion. Accounting- related 
special factors had a major impact in this con -
text, as one special purpose institution changed the accounting of promotional loans.
The income situation in terms of net interest in-
come in the narrower sense is shown in the 
statistics as being comparatively stable; much of 
this is due to the yield curve growing steeper 
over the year. This is likely to have considerably 
improved income from maturity transformation, through which around one- third of net interest 
income of all universal banks
9 was generated in 
2012 (see the box on pages 58 and 59). A strong 
preference for liquidity on the part of house -
holds and the low nominal rate of return on 
longer-  term assets had a similar effect. The re -sultant shift from longer- term deposits to sight 
deposits led to a significant easing of banks’ 
funding costs, thereby preventing pressures on 
margins from escalating. Over the course of the 
year, the declining deposit rates and the side -
ways movement in lending rates caused a slight 
trend widening again of the gross interest rate 
spread,10 both in existing and in new business, 
following a marked contraction in the previous 
year, particularly in new business. In 2013, inter -
est rates on deposits from both households and 
non- financial corporations fell to new all- time 
lows in almost all maturity categories.Funding costs

the case of networked institutions, is calculated as the dif-
ference between the volume- weighted average interest 
rates for loans and deposits of the euro area’s non- financial 
sector. For further details, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Ex -

The moderate underlying trend in net interest 
received in recent years must also be seen in 
the light of the fact that, for some time, banks 
have been tending to scale back their risk-  
bearing, more highly remunerated assets. 
Moreover, the high or increasing deposit- credit 
ratio enabled banks to reduce their capital mar -
ket debt. In 2013 in particular, liabilities from 
debt securities issued decreased sharply on the 
year; taken in isolation, this lowered funding 
costs.
Scope for improved margins is likely to become 
more and more limited in future, however, 
given the low interest rate level that has been reached in short- term deposits. What is more, 
the effects of the – for banks – more favour -
able conditions of the last few years are still 
being felt in the current phase of interest rates 
owing to the long rate fixation periods on the 
asset side. However, these effects will fade 
away increasingly as interest rate conditions in 
lending, too, are gradually adjusted to the new, 
low market interest rate level.
The favourable funding situation to date is also 
reflected in the ratio of interest expenditure to 
interest income from traditional deposit and 
lending business. In 2013, this ratio was only 
65.1% compared with the long- term average Favourable ratio

Determinants of net interest income 
for German universal banks
Banks contribute signifi  cantly to reducing 
information asymmetries and transaction costs by acting as intermediaries between lenders and borrowers of capital (fi  nancial 
intermediation). In this way, banks help fa-
cilitate a  cost- effi   cient settlement of pay-
ment and fi  nancial fl  ows in an economy.
Remuneration for these functions is re-
fl  ected, among other things, in net interest income, which is traditionally their most im-
portant source of income. Accordingly, the 
following functions can be distinguished.1
– Assumption of credit risk: Given the time that elapses between service (granting a loan) and payment (interest and redemp-
tion), uncertainty regarding compliance with repayment obligations arises in 
every fi  nancial contract. Banks charge a 
corresponding premium for assuming 
such a risk.
– Maturity transformation: Banks trans-form short- term deposits into longer- term loans. If the yield curve is positive 
– which is normally the case – the bank obtains a premium from the assumption of the associated interest rate risk.
– 
Payment and liquidity management for 
customers: The function of payment and 
liquidity management performed by 
banks on behalf of their customers is re-
fl  ected as a premium in the form of mark- ups on lending rates or mark- 
downs on deposit rates.
The above- described functional contribu-tions and their positive effects on banks’ interest margins are well documented in the empirical literature. Yet little is known 
about the actual extent of these contribu-tions. In a study, Busch and Memmel (2014) carried out a quantitative breakdown of net 
interest received for German banks in 2012.
2 To this end, the individual costs of 
each function were estimated. This includes 
the costs resulting from opting to forego 
any one alternative (opportunity costs).
The costs of payment and liquidity manage-
ment are calculated by estimating the part 
of a bank’s administrative costs that relates 
to its interest business. The relevant share 
of costs in relation to net interest income was estimated on the basis of extensive 
data sets on the number of ATMs, cards is-sued and customer transactions. Credit risk is computed using data on the composition 
of individual banks’ credit portfolios; from this it is possible to estimate how high a bank’s lending rate would have to have 
been set in order to cover expected losses 
and a risk premium.
The table on the next page shows the re-
sults for an “average” universal bank, which 
were taken from the paper by Busch and Memmel (2014). These reveal that almost half of net interest received (47%) is ac-
counted for by payment and liquidity man-
agement for customers. In 2012, just over one- third of net interest received (35%)

of 76.8%. This ratio was particularly favourable 
for networked institutions, whose business 
model enabled them to benefit from the shift 
to sight deposits. This factor had the least influ-
ence in the case of mortgage banks, which 
traditionally fund themselves by issuing long-  
term covered bonds. In this category of banks 
the importance of refinancing using longer-  
term deposits of institutional investors such as 
insurers has grown in recent years, however, 
and in 2013 reached a level of importance simi-lar to that of covered bond issuance.
The interest margin, which is usually calculated 
as net interest received in relation to the annual average balance sheet total, gives an important 
indication of the profitability of interest busi -
ness, particularly in the case of credit institu -
tions active mainly in traditional deposit and lending business. Amounting to 1.01%, it re
-
mained in the lower area of the corridor be -
tween 0.99% and 1.28% in which it has been 
since the launch of European monetary union in 1999. Nonetheless, compared with the pre-vious year it edged up slightly by 0.02 percent-
age points. Net interest received fell substan -
tially in 2013; on the other hand, the balance 
sheet total also saw a substantial decrease as a result, not least, of the distinct reduction in the holdings of trading derivatives over the course of the year.
11 In the reporting year, the adjusted 
interest rate spread, calculated as a ratio be -
tween net interest income in the narrower sense and the balance sheet total excluding both interbank business (which has no effect on net interest received) and the holdings of 
trading derivatives, stood at 1.32%, compared 
with 1.34% one year earlier (see the box on 
pages 63 and 64).Interest margin 
still narrowstemmed from maturity transformation and 
merely 16% from assuming credit risk. The 
item “Other” encompasses contributions to 
net interest received that arise from the 
slight mismatch in volume between inter-est- bearing assets and interest- bearing li-
abilities.
The sum of all component contributions 
does not necessarily have to equal net inter-
est received. On the contrary, a value of 100% implies that there is barely any re-
maining scope for other components, such 
as a bank’s relative market position, which 
could allow it to achieve income above the 
(marginal) costs or generate a contribution 
to shareholders’ remuneration.Determinants of net interest income

Embedded in a largely favourable real eco -
nomic environment, securitised lending as well 
as loans (adjusted for loan sales and securitisa-
tions and valuation effects) contracted slightly 
by 0.1% compared with the previous year. As a 
result, the possibility for the banking industry as a whole to achieve an improved result by 
raising lending volumes was limited.
Given the buoyancy of households’ demand 
for residential properties, the German housing 
market generated a moderate positive stimu -
lus. Besides a generally heightened preference 
for non-  financial assets, the likely key factors 
behind this were very low lending rates paired 
with banks’ largely unchanged credit stand -
ards, stable expectations of future income and fairly low yields on financial assets. In addition, credit growth in this business area reflected the 
persistently steep price increases faced by 
buyers of existing properties. Even so, growth 
in net lending turned out to be fairly modest at 2.0%, which is likely to be due to the fact that 
households, according to the financial ac -
counts, increased the share of their own funds 
to finance properties, ie they shifted part of their financial wealth into the acquisition of 
residential real estate.
By contrast, commercial banking saw a slight 
downward trend as investment in trade and in-
dustry remained subdued. Due to a positive 
earnings situation, moreover, enterprises were 
able to cover the vast majority of their aggre -
gate funding needs out of their own resources. 
Furthermore, non-  financial corpor ations con -
tinued to avail themselves of alternative sources 
of finance. Thus, there was confirmation of a trend that has been identifiable for a number of years. Overall, loans to commercial enter -
prises as a share of their total liabilities declined 
to 16% in 2013, compared with 23% in the 
first half and 20% in the second half of the last decade.
One crucial factor behind domestic general government’s, on the whole, muted demand 
for credit from German credit institutions was that the cyclical increase in tax revenues and 
the decline in interest expenses resulting from 
lower average interest rates allowed the gov -
ernment sector to end the financial year 2013 
with a balanced budget overall (as defined in 
the national accounts).
In the case of mortgage banks – for which net 
interest received is virtually the only source of 
income, accounting for 98.8% of their operat-
ing income on a long-
 term aver
age – the inter -
est result decreased by €0.6 billion to €1.8 bil-
lion. This category of banks, which has been 
affected by restructuring measures to a particu-
lar extent in recent years, had significantly scaled back interest-
 bearing 
assets. Nonethe -
less, because of the pronounced negative bal -
ance in other operating income, the interest 
result as a share of operating income for mort-
gage banks rose by 13.2 percentage points to 
104.2% (see also the table on page 57).
Savings banks posted net interest received of 
€23.1 billion, which was just short of the previ-
ous year’s level. Accounting for 80% of oper -
ational business, the importance of this item 
almost matched the long-  term aver age. In the 
credit cooperatives category, net interest re -
ceived rose markedly by €0.5 billion to €16.9 bil
lion, thereby accounting for a 78.5% share 
of operating income, which was slightly above the long-
 term 
average. This was largely due to 
improved net interest income from deposit and 
lending business. Net interest received by the 
Landesbanken sector fell by €0.3 billion to €8.4 
billion, accounting for 78.5% of operating in -
come, which was only marginally below the 
long-  term average. In the case of the regional 
institutions of credit cooperatives, the import -
ance of net interest received for operating in -
come rose by leaps and bounds. This was due to net interest received going up by €0.1 billion 
to €1.5 billion and, above all, to the marked 
year-  on-  year decline in net trading income. Net 
interest received as a percentage of operating 
income amounted to 68.1% (after 53.9% in 2012), so that it again moved closer to the 
long-  term average (71.2%).Demand for

A comparison of interest margins and interest rate spreads
Net interest received is by far the most im-
portant income component of the German 
banking  sector. On a long- term average, it 
accounts for just under three- quarters of German banks’ total operating income; in the case of credit institutions that are pri-
marily active in traditional deposit and lend-
ing business, this share is even higher in 
structural terms. In order to be able to use this fi  gure as an indicator of the profi  tability 
of a bank over time and compared with other institutions, net interest received is 
usually normalised with the annual average 
volume of balance sheet business. The interest margin determined in this way 
shows the relative net interest income in a 
given reporting period. Taking the average 
of all the German credit institutions re-
corded in the profi  t and loss statistics, the 
interest margin stood at 1.01% in 2013, 
compared with 1.12% in 2007, which was 
the year prior to the onset of the recent 
 fi  nancial crisis (see the chart below).
Depending on the business model and the 
category of the respective bank, net interest received and total assets are affected by dif-
ferent determinants, which makes it diffi   -
cult to perform a comparison. It is therefore advisable to adjust both fi  gures by eliminat-ing certain components.
– 
Net interest received as a statistical col-
lective variable of all income and interest- 
relevant factors also comprises current 
income as well as income from profi  t pooling, profi  t transfer agreements and partial profi  t transfer agreements. If, however, the focus is on the interest- related core business areas, then only 
the net interest income from traditional 
deposit and lending business, ie net interest income in the narrower sense, 
should be used.
– Especially in a long- term comparison, total assets should exclude interbank business, which has no effect on net 
interest received, as well as the volume of 
trading derivatives to be reported in the 
balance sheet following the introduction 
of the Act to modernise Accounting Law 
(Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz) in 2010. These trading derivatives had a 
considerable bloating effect on the Ger-
man banking sector’s annual average 
total assets from 2011 onwards and con-sequently led to a signifi  cant reduction in 
the interest margin, without this having 
an impact on earnings; primarily the big 
banks were affected.
In 2013, the adjusted interest margin calcu-lated as a ratio between net interest income 
in the narrower sense and total assets ex-cluding interbank business (which has no effect on net interest received) and the holdings of trading derivatives stood at 
1.32%.1 Based on this defi  nition, the inter-
1 When comparing the income item of various banks 
and/or categories of banks, consideration should also 
be given to the fact that the various interest- earning 
operations are subject to varying degrees of risk. Fol-
lowing the basic idea of risk- adjusted performance 
measures, the costs of assuming risks would have to 
be compared with net interest income and the ad-
justed result would have to be placed in relation to the 
risk capital invested.A comparison of interest margins

est margin was up 0.28 percentage point 
on the 2007 reference year (see the chart 
on page 63).
It should also be borne in mind that net interest received is also infl  uenced by the 
balance sheet capital ratio. All other things being equal, it can be said that the greater 
the capital ratio, the lower the cost items concerning interest expenditure on bor-rowed funds and vice versa. This effect, 
which can be attributed to differing capital structures – even though it cannot be quan-tifi  ed more precisely based on the available 
balance sheet data – merits particular at-
tention when comparing the interest mar-
gin calculations of different categories of 
banks as well as during periods of changes in capital requirements.
Furthermore, using the interest margin as a 
statistical measurement concept does not 
provide any indication of market- relevant 
factors which have an impact on the overall earnings situation. Additional information is provided, for instance, by the Lerner index, which is an indicator of the available scope 
for setting prices, or the level of competi-
tiveness in the banking sector. For example, 
there is empirical evidence to suggest that 
the relationship between income and mar-
ginal costs was relatively stable in the 
1990s, despite a trend towards decreasing interest margins. This was even followed by an increase in the Lerner index, which may 
have been due to the very favourable refi  -
nancing conditions of primary banks in con-
nection with the measures to tackle the 
 fi  nancial crisis or possibly also to safe haven effects.
2
In addition to the adjusted interest margin, 
the average gross interest rate spread is a further indicator of the contribution to profi  ts from the core business area. How-ever, whereas the interest margin focuses 
on the annual profi  t and loss account (com-
plete survey) in interest business, the gross 
interest rate spread shows the difference be-
tween the volume- weighted average inter-
est rates for loans and deposits in existing 
business with households and non- fi  nancial 
corporations. These data are based on the MFI interest rate statistics, which are har-
monised across the euro area: in Germany, 
these statistics have, since 2003, been col-
lected as a representative sample currently consisting of 236 credit institutions.
3 The 
gross interest rate spread is a meaningful in-
dicator for Germany as a whole. Compari-sons between categories of banks and an 
analysis of the earnings situation of individ-
ual banks are only possible to a certain ex-
tent, however. At 3.26%, the average an-
nual gross interest rate spread for 2013 was up by a moderate 0.31 percentage point on 
the 2007 reference year. In addition to the 
average interest rate spread, the marginal 
interest rate spread, which is also calculated on a monthly basis, is based on the average 
effective rate of interest on loans and de-
posits in new business in the respective re-
porting month. For this reason, the marginal 
interest rate spread also serves as an early indicator for price- related changes in net 
interest income.

Net interest received by the regional banks rose 
slightly by €0.5 billion to €13.2 billion, account-ing for 66.8% of operating income (long- term 
average: 68.0%). In the category of big banks, 
improved net interest income in the narrower 
sense (by €0.5 billion to €11.7 billion) com -
bined with the sharp drop in the other income 
components of net income received (by €3.3 billion to €7.5 billion) were the main reasons 
for the significant reduction in net interest re -
ceived. However, in terms of importance, net 
interest received in this category – accounting 
for 60.7% of operating income in the reporting 
year and 63.7% as a long- term average – is 
among the lowest across all bank categories.
Slight improvement in net 
commissions received
Commissions business, German banks’ second 
most important source of income, mainly com-
prises remuneration for services rendered in 
connection with the purchase and sale, safe custody and administration of securities, pro
-
cessing of payments, lending, underwriting or 
investment advice and asset management. Un-like the other main components of operational business, which posted losses, net commissions 
received of €28.7 billion were €0.6 billion up 
on the previous year. In the reporting year, net commissions received as a percentage of oper -
ating income came to 23.9%, which was 2.7 percentage points above the long- term 
average.
Net commission income benefitted from im -
portant stimuli for the equity markets emanat-ing from achieved or expected progress in the 
crisis- hit countries and from the strongly ac -
commodative monetary policy. At the end of 
2013, the DAX stood at 9,552 points to close 
the reporting year with a clear year- on- year 
gain of 25%. Nonetheless, the volume of trans-
actions on the German equity markets re -
mained very low at €1 trillion due, not least, to 
the continuing aversion to risk in customer 
business. Tendencies towards an easing of ten-sions in the international financial markets and 
the persistently very low coupon on highly 
rated fixed- income bonds likewise led to fur -
ther declines in turnover in the German bond 
market. After turnover in the bond market 
slumped by 71% in 2012, it fell by a further 14.5% to no more than €83 billion in the re
-
porting year. The marked preference for over -
night deposits as a low- risk and highly liquid 
investment form meant that virtually no in -
come flowed from direct securities transactions to net commission income. By contrast, invest-ors again showed interest in investment funds. Here, net sales rose by almost 10% to just short of €123 billion after already posting a sharp in-crease in 2012. Once again, the main focus of demand was on specialised funds, which are of particular interest to institutional investors; they accounted for 67% of total sales. In the area of 
retail funds, investors mainly favoured equity funds and mixed securities funds, which saw 
net sales surge by €6.8 billion. On the whole, 
net sales of retail funds rose by €7.1 billion to 
€9.2 billion.
Accounting for a 31.9% share as a long- term 
average, net commission income is traditionally more important for the operational business of 
big banks than for the other categories of 
banks. In the reporting year, big banks gener -
ated 33.8% of their operating income through 
net commissions received and almost 40% of 
net commissions received by all bank categor -
ies. At a total of €10.7 billion, big banks in -
creased their net commission income by 5.4%, 
thus playing a large part in improving the ag -
gregate figure for all bank categories. In the 
savings banks and credit cooperatives sectors, 
net commission income picked up slightly to 
rise to €6.2 billion and €4.2 billion respectively. 
In those two categories of banks, net commis-
sions received as a percentage of operating in-
come came to 21.6% and 19.5% respectively; 
this was above the long-  term averages of 
18.1% and 18.5% respectively. The operating 
income of the networked institutions is trad -
itionally characterised by stable net commis -
sions received, which stem to a large extent Slight rise in

from account management fees, but are also 
likely to comprise income from the brokering of 
products of enterprises belonging to the re -
spective financial group (eg investment fund 
companies). This makes net commissions re -
ceived much less dependent on the volatile 
equity markets than in the other categories of 
banks. The Landesbanken sector saw its result 
contract by 16.4% to €0.7 billion. This was the 
outcome, above all, of significantly higher ex -
penditure for the provision of government guarantees in the case of two Landesbanken 
which felt the impact of the shipping crisis to a 
particular extent. On the whole, this probably 
explains in part why net commissions received 
has become considerably less important for the 
Landesbanken sector’s income situation at the 
aggregate level since 2009. In the reporting 
year, net commissions received accounted for only 6.9% of operating income, compared 
with 12.6% as the long- term average.Loss of income in trading
Despite positive developments on the national and international equity markets and the recov-ery in the value of crisis- hit countries’ sovereign 
bonds, the trading result – which is typically 
highly volatile – fell considerably by €1.3 billion to €5.9 billion. It should be noted that, accord-
ing to the published business reports, trading 
refers primarily to customer business and very 
little proprietary trading. The trading result as a 
share of operating income decreased by 0.6 percentage points, but at 4.9% was still 
clearly above the long- term average of 2.7%.
The development of the trading result in the different categories of banks was greatly af

ponents from the net result from the trading 
portfolio to net interest received.12 The with -
drawal by another big bank of €0.5 billion from 
the fund for general banking risks pursuant to 
section 340e (4) of the German Commercial Code had the opposite effect in that it was 
treated as income under the net trading profit 
or loss. On balance, the trading result as a share 
of the operating income of big banks came to 
12.1%, which was still well above the long- term 
average of 5.5%. The regional institutions of 
credit cooperatives posted a steep loss in their 
trading result by €0.5 billion to a mere €0.3 bil-
lion; according to the published business re -
ports, this was largely due to a decline in posi-tive valuation effects. As a result, they saw their 
trading result as a share of operating income 
halved to 16%. Nonetheless, its importance for 
operating income both in the reporting year 
and in terms of the long- term average remains 
markedly higher than for other categories of banks. Landesbanken were able to almost 
double their trading result (€1.3 billion) as well 
as their trading result as a share of operating income (12.5%) thanks, mainly, to sales and 
valuation gains in the area of trading portfolio 
derivatives. In terms of the long- term average, 
however, its importance – accounting for a 
share of 3.1% – was appreciably lower than in 
the case of big banks and regional institutions 
of credit cooperatives. As in earlier years, the 
trading result was of virtually no significance in the aggregate for the other categories of banks with regard to the P&L account.
Notable deterioration in net 
other operating result
This summary item in the profit and loss statis-
tics essentially comprises earnings and ex -
penses from leasing business, the gross result 
for transactions in goods and subsidiary busi -
ness as well as other operating income or ex -
penses. The latter also includes provisions for 
the risk of litigation costs, which were increas-
ingly extensive in a number of banking cat -
egories in the past few years. With a net ex -pense of €0.9 billion – the balance was still 
clearly positive in the previous year, at €1.6 bil-
lion – the figure shown in this item was the 
lowest in the observation period since 1993. 
Besides the regional banks, where net earnings saw a considerable €0.8 billion decline to €1.1 
billion, this was due mainly to the big banks 
and their distinctly increased negative balance, which grew by €0.7 billion to €2.1 billion.Negative

Less favourable cost/income 
ratio
The decline in income from operating business 
again posed major challenges for credit institu-
tions’ cost and process management. Savings 
banks and credit cooperatives in particular took 
advantage of further potential for savings and 
synergies arising from the continued reduction 
of their branch networks (by 557 to 23,864). In 
contrast to this, there was a significant increase 
in the big banks sector (of 569 to 7,610). This 
was mainly attributable to a rise in the number 
of partner enterprises’ branches with only 
limited bank services in some cases. On bal -
ance, the number of branches decreased only a 
little, falling by 40 to 34,531 (see table on 
page 66). Within administrative costs, declining 
staff costs contrasted with higher other admin-
istrative costs. On balance, total operating costs
13 remained largely unchanged year- on- 
year at just under €83 billion given mixed de -
velopments among the categories of banks.
In staff costs, the costs for wages and salaries 
fell by €0.3 billion to €34.6 billion. This was ap-
parent at the big banks in particular and was 
primarily caused by lower expenditure on vari-
able remuneration components as well as a 
further decline in the number of employees in 
this banking category. Both of these factors partially counteracted the spending on salary 
increases set out in the collective wage agree-
ment14 concluded in June 2012 for employees 
of private and public banks. There was also a 
€0.5 billion reduction in pension expenses to 
€2.9 billion. Here, too, along with the positive 
valuation effects for plan assets carried at fair 
value,15 it is likely that a part was played by job 
cuts, which continued at a moderate pace in 
the German banking sector in the year under 
review (see table on page 66).
Other administrative costs primarily include 
non- staff costs and expenditure on external 
services such as audit and consultancy costs. The bank levy,
16 which was first charged in 
2011, is also primarily reflected within this item according to the published annual reports. 
Overall, this cost item rose significantly by €0.9 
billion to €39.9 billion. In particular, the meas-
ures taken to fulfil stricter regulatory require -
ments are likely to have had an impact again 
here. Since the big banks category in particular 
recorded both an increase in other administra-tive costs and falling staff costs, its administra-
tive spending (€24.8 billion) hardly changed 
against the previous year on balance.
The cost/income ratio, which expresses the ratio of administrative expenses to operating 
income, saw a clear year- on- year deterioration. 
This indicator’s value rose by 4.9 percentage 
points to 69.1%. A key factor in this develop -
ment was the significant decline in operating income, which was partly affected by special factors, with administrative spending remain
-
ing virtually unchanged.
Compared with the other categories of banks, 
the big banks sector again posted the worst 
performance both in the reporting year and on 
a long- term average, with a cost/income ratio 
that was up by 9.5 percentage points to 
78.3%.17 This was probably connected not least 
with the relatively high percentage of variable remuneration components – although these 
were declining at the end of the period under 
review – which place a strain on administrative Administrative 
costs virtually unchanged

of the German Bank Restructuring Act, Monthly Report, 
June 2011, pp 59-75. According to a press release from the 
Federal Agency for Financial Market Stabilisation dated 22 November 2013, the bank levy reduced the earnings 
position by a total of €0.5 billion in the year under review.17 The poor cost/income ratio of 89% in the case of spe-
cial purpose banks was essentially due to the purely accounting- related special item in net interest received 
owing to one institution changing its accounting method 
for promotional loans and was not taken into account in 
this comparison.Deutsche Bundesbank

expenses. Landesbanken and mortgage banks, 
which were particularly affected by the fall- out 
from the financial crisis, and where the cost/in-
come ratio rose by 2.2 percentage points to 
61.8% and by 23.7 percentage points to 75.4% 
respectively, both demonstrated the lowest cost efficiency for their categories in the observation 
period since 1993. Mortgage banks in particu-
lar, which always show the least diversification 
in operating income compared with the other 
categories of banks, suffered from the fact that 
their net interest income was declining consid -
erably. The cost/income ratio for the regional institutions of credit cooperatives, which was very favourable in the previous year thanks 
mainly to an above- average net trading result, 
deteriorated by 10 percentage points but, at 52.3%, was still significantly below the long-  
term average of 57.4%. Unlike the other cat
-
egories of banks, the networked institutions 
have a relatively dense branch network, which 
has a considerably negative effect on adminis -
trative costs when viewed in isolation. The cost/
income ratio was therefore within the normal range for these categories of banks, at 67.1% 
for the savings banks (2012: 65.7%) and 64.6% for the credit cooperatives (2012: 65.9%). In the regional banks category, with a ratio of 64.8%, this indicator did not change notably against ei-ther the previous year or the long- term average 
(see table on page 67).
Net valuation result 
 moderate
While the income reported in net income or 
net charges from valuation of assets18 almost 
halved to €4.0 billion, expenditure declined by 
only €1.2 billion to €10.4 billion. Even though 
the net valuation result, at -€6.5 billion, was 
worse than in 2012, it still stood at a very low 
level (-€15.8 billion as a long- term average) 
thanks to robust economic conditions and 
good portfolio quality, and, not least, as a re -
sult of the accounting reallocation effect.19 In 
this profit and loss analysis, the net balance 
from the establishment and reversal of hidden reserves is taken into account in the net valu -
ation result and affects the level of profit for 
the financial year, while the net balance from 
withdrawals and transfers relating to the fund 
for general banking risks (disclosed reserves) is 
only reported as part of the appropriation of 
profits when building reserves.
Risk provisioning in lending business as ex -
pressed in the net valuation result, which com-prises additions and reversals for write- downs, 
impairment losses and provisions, was the chief beneficiary of the healthy condition of the Ger -
many economy, a sustained high level of em -
ployment and the buoyant real estate markets. 
The total number of insolvencies in Germany, 
for example, was 6% lower than in the previ -
ous year. With the volume of outstanding re -
ceivables significantly lower, the number of consumer insolvencies fell by 6.6%, and the 
number of business insolvencies was down by 
as much as 8.1%. This meant that the number of business insolvencies showed a year- on- year 
fall for the fourth time in succession, and the 
number of consumer insolvencies was down on the year for the third consecutive time.

tive balance

18 The net valuation result comprises income from write- 
ups on securities in the liquidity reserve, receivables and 
loans, as well as from the reversal of loan- loss provisions, in 
addition to expenditure from impairment losses and write- downs on securities in the liquidity reserve, receivables and 
loans and from additions to loan- loss provisions. Within 
this item, use had already been made of the cross- offsetting 
option permissible under section 340 f (3) of the German 
Commercial Code.
19 Against the backdrop of the tightened rules defining 
capital recognised as such from a banking supervision per -
spective at the European level (CRR/CRD IV), the networked 
institutions in particular have converted hidden reserves 
into disclosed reserves – on a considerable scale in some 
cases – to strengthen the tier 1 capital base from 2011 on-
wards, a measure that has no effect on earnings. This re -
versal of hidden reserves was recognised as income in the 
net valuation result, while the addition to disclosed re -
serves was only accounted for as part of the appropriation of profit. For details, see Deutsche Bundesbank, The effect 
of reallocating undisclosed reserves pursuant to section 340 f of the German Commercial Code as disclosed re

Easing tensions in the international securities 
markets are likely to have had a beneficial im -
pact on the net valuation result for securities in 
the liquidity reserve. According to the pub -
lished annual reports, this was reflected in 
write- ups and disposal gains, which had a posi-
tive effect in that item.
Leaving aside Landesbanken and regional insti-
tutions of credit cooperatives, the net valuation 
result in the other categories of banks im -
proved distinctly in comparison with the long- 
term average. It was most favourable at sav -
ings banks and credit cooperatives, where it 
again had a positive impact, at €0.1 billion and 
€0.3 billion respectively. Alongside the lower need for credit risk provisions, the published annual reports show that the big banks also benefited from disposal gains and write- ups 
with respect to securities in the liquidity re
-
serve. With a negative balance of just €1 bil -
lion, they added €2.0 billion less to the net valuation result than in the previous year. At -€3.3 billion in the case of Landesbanken, the 
net valuation result in this sector was the poor -
est compared with the other categories of 
banks. In the previous year, it was only just in 
negative territory, mainly thanks to positive 
special factors. Once again, the persistent crisis 
in the shipping markets caused the affected Landesbanken to post sometimes very large 
write- downs on the loan portfolios in this sec-
tor.
To improve comparability over time and be -
tween the categories of banks, analysis of the 
ratio of the net valuation result to total assets 
can also be used. With the exception of Lan -
desbanken, this ratio showed an improvement in the other categories of banks compared with 
their respective long-  term averages. Special 
factors should be taken into account here, 
however. In the observation period from 1993 to 2010, for example, the ratio of the net valu-
ation result to total assets, especially for the 
networked institutions, was mostly among the 
least favourable compared with the other cat -
egories of banks. The long- term average for 
this ratio was -0.25% across all categories of banks; in the savings bank sector it stood at 
-0.38% and for the credit cooperatives it was 
-0.40%. This was probably related to their busi-
ness model and the associated focus on lend -
ing to private individuals and SMEs. The notice-
able improvement in this ratio after 2010 was 
not due to a surge in credit quality, but mainly to the income recorded in the net valuation re-sult from the reallocation of hidden reserves as 
disclosed reserves, which had a positive effect 
in 2011 and 2012 especially.
Strains on extraordinary 
 result again declining

dinary account, which decreased by €2.5 bil -

the narrower sense,21 income and expenditure 
from financial investment business and from 
the absorption of losses incurred by affiliated 
enterprises. In addition, expenditure from profit transfers
22 is reported here, as it cannot be al-
located to actual operating business. This re -
duced the extraordinary account by €4.8 billion 
in the reporting year (2012: €4.1 billion) and mainly affected the categories of regional 
banks and other commercial banks.
In 2013, the subsiding tensions in the financial 
markets led to further write- ups and once 
again to a significantly declining negative bal -
ance in financial investment business.23 This 
balance improved on the previous year by €3.6 
billion to a figure of just €2.1 billion. In 2011, a net expense of €10.5 billion had still impacted on the earnings position. Landesbanken in par -
ticular cut their net expenses by €1 billion to 
just €0.3 billion. This was due not least to sig-
nificantly lower expenditure arising from fulfil -
ment of covenants from the EU state aid pro -cedure at one Landesbank. The big banks also 
posted a smaller negative balance of €1.3 bil -
lion, down by €0.9 billion. In the case of sav -
ings banks, however, net expense from finan -
cial investment business, which showed a slight 
year- on- year improvement at €0.9 billion, was 
still considerably less favourable than the long- term average. Much of this is likely to be due to 
write- downs on participating interests in indi -
vidual Landesbanken.

Profit for the financial year 
and balance sheet profit
At €21.5 billion, the aggregate profit for the 
 financial year before tax was still considerably 
down on its prior- year figure by 28.7%. At the 
same time as balance sheet capital24 rose 
– growing 5.2% year- on- year to €406.6 billion 
on the annual average – the return on equity 
consequently fell markedly by 2.5 percentage 
points to 5.3%. In total, balance sheet capital 
rose by 18.5% between 2010 and 2013 as part 
of the appropriation of profits and injections of external capital. Since risk- weighted assets de-
clined during the same period, the resilience of 
the German banking sector is likely to have been strengthened on balance. The balance 
sheet capital ratio reached its highest value in 
the observation period since 1993, hitting 
4.8% (long- term average: 3.7%).
Considered by banking category, performance 
continued to be strongly differentiated. The re -turn on equity at the networked institutions de -
clined again, particularly as a result of the re -
newed steep rise in balance sheet capital, due 
mainly to the high net transfers to the fund for 
general banking risks from the previous year.25 
Nonetheless, measured in terms of this profit -
ability ratio, these institutions posted by far the 
best performance compared with the other cat -
egories of banks. Credit cooperatives generated 
a return on equity of 14.8%, with a slightly 
higher profit for the financial year before tax (up €0.2 billion to €7.6 billion). The ratio was 10.6% 
for savings banks, which reported a perceptibly 
reduced profit for the financial year that was 
down €0.9 billion to €8.6 billion. Since the net 
valuation result was again positive in both cat -
egories of banks, the reallocation effect is likely to have positively affected profit for the financial year in the reporting year as well. The calculation 
of the return on equity taking into account the 
adjusted profit for the financial year, ie reduced by net transfers to the fund for general banking 
risks, resulted for 2013 in a return on equity of 
7.9% in the cooperative bank sector and 5.6% in 
the savings bank sector. Considered from this 
perspective, too, the networked institutions out -
performed the other categories of banks.
Regional banks recorded a distinctly higher 
profit for the financial year before tax, but had 
also considerably strengthened their balance sheet capital base. As a result, the return on equity, at 5.3%, was 0.8 percentage point 
worse than in the previous year. This indicator 
fell by 2.1 percentage points to 4.6% in the 
case of big banks on the back of a distinct de-

25 As part of the reallocation of hidden reserves as dis -

base. The return on equity for regional institu-
tions of credit cooperatives went down by 
0.8 percentage point to 4.1%, affected by lower profit for the financial year before tax and higher balance sheet capital. Mortgage 
banks, where balance sheet capital was down 
again, were at the lower end of the scale in a 
long-  term comparison, too, with a return on 
equity of 0.7%, alongside Landesbanken with a 
return on equity of -0.8%.26 In the latter cat -
egory of bank, high credit risk provisioning was the chief factor reducing earnings.
As part of the appropriation of profits, the 
amounts set aside from the profit for the finan -
cial year increase equity only in the following year 
after the annual accounts are adopted, while withdrawals from equity items are to be de
-
ducted from balance sheet capital at the latest when the annual accounts are prepared.
27 On 
balance, an amount of €7.6 billion was trans -
ferred to the fund for general banking risks (2012: 
€13.6 billion), which was likely to have also come, among other things, from the reallocation 
of hidden reserves as disclosed reserves.28 Re-
serves and participation rights capital were in -
creased by €0.4 billion. As in previous years, the savings banks and credit cooperatives in particu
-
lar strengthened their balance sheet capital. The 
increase in the big banks sector was largely the 
result of a reclassification measure with no eco -
nomic effects on the balance sheet capital base.29

26 The negative profitability at special purpose banks, 
which was mainly attributable to the accounting-  related 
special item in net interest received from one special pur -
pose institution changing its accounting method for pro -
motional loans, was not taken into account in this com -
parison.
27 This accounting practice affects the amount of annual 
average balance sheet capital.
28 The net transfers recorded as expenses in the net trad-
ing result pursuant to section 340e (4) of the German 
Commercial Code are not contained in these net transfers.29 At one big bank, amounts from the earmarked special 
item contained in the fund for general banking risks were reversed pursuant to section 340e (4) of the German Com-mercial Code and recognised as income in the net trading 
result, in order to then re- transfer them to the non-  
earmarked portion of the fund for general banking risks as part of the appropriation of profit. This reclassification had no effect on the amount of balance sheet capital.Deutsche Bundesbank

Landesbanken and special purpose banks re -
versed balance sheet capital items on balance in 
order to offset losses. Furthermore, the €0.3 bil -
lion increase to €8.1 billion in net losses brought 
forward30 placed a strain on the financial result, 
although – as in earlier years – these were con -
centrated on individual mortgage banks, special 
purpose banks and regional banks.
Taking into account reduced expenses for taxes 
on income and earnings, the result was an ag-gregate balance sheet loss for the sixth time in succession now, which, at €1.7 billion, was also 
clearly greater than the previous year. As in 
2012, this was due in particular to the balance 
sheet losses reported at the level of the cat -
egories of mortgage banks (€4.8 billion), spe -
cial purpose banks (€2.0 billion) and, to a lesser extent, regional banks (€0.2 billion). The nega-
tive balance sheet results were again concen -
trated on a small number of larger institutions. 
All other categories of banks reported a bal -
ance sheet profit.
Outlook
The analysis of current earnings performance cannot make use of reporting at the level of the individual entity pursuant to the German Commercial Code. Even so, important clues 
and points of reference are provided by the in-
traperiod consolidated reporting of the cat -
egory of major German banks with an inter -
national focus31 reporting under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In the first 
half of 2014, this category had income from operating business of €31.8 billion, which 
– given distinctly declining total assets – was a 
good 8% below the corresponding prior- year 
figure. Both net interest received and the net 
trading result decreased significantly, while net commissions received showed a slight increase. 
The considerably lower addition to credit risk 
provisions had a stabilising effect, with a posi-
tive special item in the Landesbanken sector 
also playing a role. Overall, the net result be -
fore tax of €8.0 billion was only just below the corresponding figure for the previous year, re -
sulting in a somewhat lower return on equity 
along with slightly higher balance sheet capital.
The economic outlook in Germany became 
gloomier from the middle of the year onwards 
against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions. 
Nonetheless, the underlying macroeconomic 
trend looks set to remain positive in spite of dampening factors and a waning pace of 
growth in the first half of 2014. This outlook is 
suggested by the sound labour market situ -
ation and households’ high propensity to pur -
chase, as well as favourable conditions in the 
housing market and, not least, the fact that the 
domestic business sector is in robust shape. These factors constitute a significant counter
-
balance to turbulence in the external setting, 
which is also likely to keep the costs of banks’ 
credit risk provisioning within limits. However, 
heightened uncertainty has again intensified 
the search for liquid and secure forms of invest-
ment. Furthermore, the Governing Council of the ECB adopted further expansionary meas
-
ures in June 2014.
The yields on outstanding listed Federal bonds 
with residual maturities of nine to ten years fell from 1.5% to just 1.0% between April and Au-
gust, hitting new all- time lows in some cases. 
In addition, the yield curve flattened noticeably 
over the course of the year in the expectation 
of continued very low short- term interest rates, 
and has been moving around the zero- interest 
mark for shorter- term maturities since June. 
This is likely to keep margin pressure in interest business high and have a growing negative im-
pact on the earnings potential from maturity 
transformation. The fairly steady performance 
to date of the networked institutions, which 
generate a large part of their net interest in -
come from maturity transformation, will be 
particularly affected by this. The ECB Governing Balance sheet

Council’s resolutions of 4 September 2014 will 
probably point in the same direction; besides a further cut to the key interest rates of 10 basis 
points (with effect from 10 September 2014), they provide for the purchase of securitised 
loans and Pfandbriefe. If nothing else, credit in-
stitutions’ liquidity management is likely to tend to gain in importance. On the cost side, 
measures to implement the fulfilment of stricter 
regulatory requirements as well as the high 
costs of restructuring will have a continuing im-
pact. Under these conditions, scope to create 
earnings potential will remain very constrained in the short term.
